Inception is excellent. The direction, the script, the acting,
everything adds up to make it one of the most challenging major studio
films to come out in quite some time. It&#x27;s tough to say if it is
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s best film but it definitely is up there with The
Dark Knight and Memento.<br /><br />I love the whole idea of being able to enter someone&#x27;s dream in order
to steal an idea of their&#x27;s. It&#x27;s such an interesting concept. I have
of course heard by now that Christopher Nolan worked on the Inception
script for a very long period of time, ten years or so. I can
definitely say that it is worth it.<br /><br />Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy are the standout performances in
Inception, Ellen Page for successfully acting very well in a role far
from many of the others she&#x27;s played, and Cillian Murphy for taking a
role that has so much emotional depth and executing it perfectly. The
entire cast does well here and this is one of the best things about
Inception. The fact that it can have such an outlandish plot line and
still draw you in and make it believable is probably Inception&#x27;s best
trait.<br /><br />I love how Christopher Nolan makes big budget action movies but isn&#x27;t
afraid to not only infuse his idiosyncratic style into them, but also
to infuse an emotional depth in them. Inception is no exception.
