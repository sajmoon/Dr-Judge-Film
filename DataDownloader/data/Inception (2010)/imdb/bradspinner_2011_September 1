An interesting concept, but not enough to carry 2/12 hours, the effects
work, the performances are great but as far as I&#x27;m concerned they serve
to mask (beautifully) a real lack of depth in the script. Still worth
seeing but doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.<br /><br />Dicaprio is as ever an excellent lead and the support performances are
more than competent, given this and everything else available to
Christpher Nolan ($160m to start with) I personally am a little
disappointed with the final product, I expected to have felt like I&#x27;d
experienced something new given the hype, but in the end (other than
the wonderful effects) I saw an OK movie hung on an OK premise.
