This is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, the British
director who is rapidly becoming my favourite director and, surely, the
leading British director of his generation This is a complex,
complicated, thrilling, moving film that manages to engage through to
the very end.<br /><br />Moreover Nolan did not only direct this film, he also wrote it and
produced it Astonishing Especially as Mr Nolan is not even 40 yet !
From the man who brought us &#x22;Memento&#x22; this is the tale of Cobb played
by Leonardo Di Caprio who is an &#x22;extractor&#x22; - paid by clients to
capture secrets from deep within the minds of his targets.<br /><br />In interviews the director has expressed a wish for audiences to know
as little as possible about the story before seeing the film - and
having seen this film tonight I can see why So I will say little more
about the detail of the story.<br /><br />The cast is strong - Di Caprio, for me, is growing into his face as an
actor and gets better as time goes on Joseph Gordon Levitt may be
remembered by some for his role in the wonderful 3rd Rock from the Sun
but here he is excellent as sidekick Arthur Add in Ellen Page, Marion
Cotillard ( whose presence clearly inspired one of the hidden little
jokes in the story that my wife rather than I picked up ) Michael Caine
and Pete Postlethwaite and we have a cast strong enough to carry a
weighty story.<br /><br />This is a breathtaking film, surely Nolan cannot keep churning out
fabulous films like this ? - well maybe, wonderfully he can.<br /><br />The music in this film is perfect, never intrusive <br /><br />For the film a holics who see this you may well pick up elements of
James Bond,Ocean&#x27;s Eleven and the Matrix - but do not get me wrong this
is definitely its own film and wonderful for it <br /><br />Moving, exciting and thought provoking. <br /><br />I felt the need to watch Memento three times before I felt I had a
comprehensive understanding of it I can see myself watching this
masterpiece at least once more <br /><br />9/10 Bravo Christopher Nolan I can&#x27;t believe that you&#x27;re not even 40
yet
