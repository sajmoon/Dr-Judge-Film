Inception is a good scifi action movie with a complicated plot that, at
times, doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense. The Acting was great, the
characters were all likable and well portrayed. The look of the film
was great, the sets, special effects, action, direction ... all top
notch. The premise was also quite intriguing and original. The story
focuses around a group of &#x22;dream invaders&#x22; who specialize in
constructing dreams for people for the purpose of stealing or
implanting information and ideas from them from within the dream. At
times it&#x27;s hard to tell when they&#x27;re in a dream or in the real world
and I admit, in the beginning, the film was a bit baffling. But the
viewer who pays close attention is rewarded for his attentiveness when
it starts to make more sense a quarter of the way through this film.<br /><br />A lot of people have compared this movie to the Matrix because it
explores the idea of the &#x22;real world&#x22; verses an artificially created
&#x22;dream world&#x22;. And in that respect they are very similar. But whereas
The Matrix focused more on a conflict between man and machine,
Inception focuses on the conflict between a man and his difficulty with
letting go. The true strength of this film is in its characterization.
Both the protagonist, Cobb, and the antagonist, Fischer, are very well
written and portrayed characters that you feel genuine empathy for,
especially towards the end. But where Inception surpasses The Matrix in
terms of characterization, it falls short of the Matrix in its success
at making a consistent plot.<br /><br />In science fiction or fantasy, it is not required to remain consistent
to the laws of science, but it is required to remain consistent to ones
own constructed rules. This film constructs a set of rules for itself
that, when held under scrutiny, don&#x27;t make much sense. Indeed, the
confusing narrative often breaks its own rules in order to suit the
plot. This wouldn&#x27;t be so much of a problem if not for the fact that
much of the tension of the film revolves around the fact that the
characters&#x27; lives are in danger due to these often contradicting rules.<br /><br />It is no surprise that one of the biggest complaints heard from people
walking out of this film was that it was too confusing. Some may argue
that these viewers did not pay close enough attention to the film, and
some may even be elitist enough to assume that they were simply not
intelligent enough to follow the plot. While this may be the case, I
try to reserve such judgments when I can. But it cannot be denied that
much of the fault lies with the plot of the film itself.<br /><br />Much of the mechanics of the dream world levels and architecture are
poorly explained at times, and there are fundamental contradictions
with some of the rules it lays out for us. Often times we&#x27;re left
wondering what exactly is at stake for our characters, and why we
should care whether or not they succeed. The somewhat purposefully
unclear ending may account for some of these inconsistencies and on
repeated viewings the mechanics may make more sense. But the lack of
tension during the more climactic scenes due to the ambiguous nature of
what&#x27;s at stake is still a major problem with this film.<br /><br />These problems aside, it is a film worth seeing probably more than
once. But I think the hype machine may have given this one a little
more credit than it deserves.
