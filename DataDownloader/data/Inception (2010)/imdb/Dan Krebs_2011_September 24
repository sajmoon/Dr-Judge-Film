I often compare movie ratings with religion. Just because most people
say it&#x27;s so, doesn&#x27;t mean it is. This is particularly true for this
pretentious piece of c$%p. To echo that of previous reviewers, weak
plot, overly confusing attempt at creating another &#x27;dream movie&#x27;. I
attempted to watch this film 4 times, refusing to accept that I
couldn&#x27;t &#x27;get it&#x27;. The fourth attempt lasted slightly longer as I
wanted to give it more attention. However, boredom soon set in and I
found myself reaching for the remote control once more.<br /><br />It really amazes me that people can enjoy watching such pap. If you
want to watch a good dream movie then try &#x27;Eternal sunshine of the
spotless mind&#x27;
