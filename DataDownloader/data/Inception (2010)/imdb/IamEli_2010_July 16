Inception is a ridiculously detailed movie, that is helmed by as much
of a star (Christopher Nolan) than perhaps even his own all-star cast.
You travel to the depths of the mind as far as no movie ever traveled
before, and the concept is so mind boggling that you leave with doubts
about your own existence. And without the help of the top stars of this
movie, which you&#x27;re sure to like at least one, I&#x27;m not sure that I
would enjoy the rattling of my skull as much.<br /><br />It is a considerable task to determine all the symbols and reasons
before the events actually occur, and they occur at different rates of
time, and reality is warped. Without spoilers, I will say that the
places you travel are disturbing, and epic.<br /><br />Inception requires a heavy dose of story build up, and the
multi-dimensional climax is something to behold. And it takes some will
of the viewer to follow along, but that is also one of Inceptions
rewards: Is that it is challenging and worth the brain power you put
into it.<br /><br />Yes, Inception travels along at its own pace, and yes it can be
overwhelming at a point, but the scenes are so masterfully put
together, that it works. This movie is a lavish, unforgettable puzzle.
At some point, you don&#x27;t care about why they are there, only about how
it will come to fruition. After all, it isn&#x27;t the characters you
decidedly care about, it is the ultimate climax of this deeply
conceived movie.<br /><br />The ending is full of question, but not frustratingly so. I say this
with full regard of its affect, that the ending is appropriate, and
should never be tampered with again. I do not ever want to see some
directors cut out there that has a more &#x22;Hollywood&#x22; ending.
Unbelievable
