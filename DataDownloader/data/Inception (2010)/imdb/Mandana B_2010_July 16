My mind is aching(!!!) I have just seen the movie and I really liked
it. I went to cinema with 8 other people and all of them were
satisfied. After Avatar I was very disappointed about cinema. But
Inception showed that brilliant ideas still exist and it shows that how
can you apply visual effects to tell a story not just to show off! It
has something new to offer. I&#x27;m not a fan of science fiction movies,
specially ones with strange creatures. What makes me to like Inception
this much is the fact that it picks one real thing, something we
encounter every day, our dreams, and takes us to the unknown world of
dreaming. <br /><br />I loved Matrix at it&#x27;s time and I&#x27;m loving Inception. It feels more
real than every other Sci-Fiction movie I have ever seen. Worth
watching, absolutely recommendable!
