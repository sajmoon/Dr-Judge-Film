Now I&#x27;ll admit that this doesn&#x27;t make you think as much as the Matrix
did but it&#x27;s still very brilliant. If you think like Nolan you will be
able to understand as to how he constructed the rules of this film.
When the main characters go through so much of the rules of a dream
with you it naturally fits in with how a person scientifically
interprets it. Rather than just nodding your head and accepting like
whatever you hear in Pirates of the Caribbean, the elements of this
film just flow. Hence I didn&#x27;t have a hard time understanding the plot.<br /><br />Unlike the Matrix or Fight Club this film is not an existentialist but
rather an analysis of the human subconscious. Therefore you will not
have any sleepless nights after watching this film. There are barely
any religious implications thats what I love, instead very scientific.<br /><br />Now lets get to Nolan. I love his films because they are both plot and
character oriented. You have excellent development in both areas.
That&#x27;s why they aren&#x27;t hard to love.<br /><br />This film itself will plant the idea in your head to like it. I
guarantee.
