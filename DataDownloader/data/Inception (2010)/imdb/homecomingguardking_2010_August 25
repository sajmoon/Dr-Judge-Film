How do I review this movie? I could start by addressing the opinion
that some people found it confusing. Understandable, since you have to
pay attention to know what&#x27;s going on, but when I did, I felt right at
home with this movie.<br /><br />I could also say a few things about the concept of the film, which has
a lot to do about dreams, the ones we have at night. This concept, like
Avatar, Legion, and Face Off, had me captivated from the beginning to
the end. In fact, I was so captivated that I didn&#x27;t want it to end.<br /><br />But now that I started the review, I will go further.<br /><br />The summer&#x27;s array of movies had let-downs like The Last Airbender, and
I&#x27;m not even WANTING to see The Other Guys or Eclipse. But this summer
had a few bright spots too, like Toy Story 3, Despicable Me, and Step
Up 3D. Inception probably blows pretty much all those summer flicks,
with the exception of Toy Story 3, out of the water. The plot is for
the people who want to listen for it and so, the movie is for those who
want to see into it and not just watch it. But for those who understand
the movie, you&#x27;re in for a wild ride of your life.
