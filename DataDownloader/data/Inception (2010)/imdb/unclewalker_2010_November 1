(2/2)De Caprio is getting better and better.Joseph Gordon Levitt could
win Oscar for Best Supporting actor.Murphy looks better in negative
roles(I must confess).Ken Watanabe got more room to prove his acting
skills.Michael Caine&#x27;s presence is indispensable.Page,Rao,Hardy are OK.<br /><br />(2/2)Story.WOW.This dream within a dream is though not a completely new
notion(if you are an avid comic book reader).But Nolan proved that he
is best in this business.Oscar for best original screenplay.<br /><br />(2/2)Direction is top notch.Remind us of Memento.The climax scene is a
killer.<br /><br />(2/2)Looks like Nolan and Hans Zimmer are made for each other.The
trailer score by Zack Hemsey scored over the complete movie
soundtrack.Hats off Hemsey.<br /><br />(2/2)Are you kidding ? The complete flick is a powerhouse.Full on X-
FACTOR.
