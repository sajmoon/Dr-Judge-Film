This has to be as good as movie making can be. I am no expert, but,
this movie deserves all the praise it is getting. For some reason some
of the &#x22;professional movie critics&#x22; are not as excited as real movie
fans It is a movie that bleeds intensity from the first moments. Yes,
it is very complex. Give credit to Nolan for giving movie fans some
credit. Yes, we can follow it and yes, we don&#x27;t all want Big Budget
mindless movies. Inception is a beautiful movie. Great Acting, Great
Music, Fantastic Story, Perfect Ending!! IT was an extremely
entertaining experience. I will see this movie again and it is one I
can not wait to own. Bravo!!
