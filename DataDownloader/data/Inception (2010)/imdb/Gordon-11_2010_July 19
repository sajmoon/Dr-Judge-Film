This film is about a man who is hired to implant false memories by a
businessman into a rival businessman.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; excels on so many levels. Firstly, the plot is so intricate
that it requires a lot of brain activity to understand. It is
constantly cognitively challenging the viewers to keep up with the pace
of the plot. I do not recall another film requiring so much thinking
and digesting.<br /><br />Secondly, the special effects are great, in every dream sequence there
are effects to make people go wow. I particularly am impressed by the
explosions in the first test dream sequence between Leonardo DiCaprio
and Ellen Page, and also the anti gravity effects. These effects do not
come across as pretentious or contrived, like many other films where
special effect scenes exist only for the sake of looking good in 3D.<br /><br />Furthermore, the cinematography is well done. In addition, the array of
great performances by a stellar cast is already well worth watching.
