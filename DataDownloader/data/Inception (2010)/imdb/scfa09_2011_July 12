I am too impressed!! Finally watched some mind blowing action thriller
movie which also significantly included the emotional problems and
conflicts of the lead character. Normally I am not much of a fan of
high profiled action movies, but this one wasn&#x27;t as violent as other
action movies. I am very much fond of the dream and the subconscious
world, so I was bound to like this movie.<br /><br />Leonardo, as always, acted out his character really well. I couldn&#x27;t
help noticing how perfectly fit Cillian Murphy was for the role of
Robert Fischer.<br /><br />At the end, most of the credit goes to Nolan in how he managed to leave
his audience in awe after this movie.
