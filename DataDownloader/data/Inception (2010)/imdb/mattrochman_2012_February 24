I think Hollywood has battled to get a good film out for many years.
While most has just been &#x27;formular&#x27; rubbish and sequels, the occasional
&#x27;outside the square&#x27; film is often ridiculous, boring or starts with a
good idea but doesn&#x27;t know where to go with it.<br /><br />Inception open powerfully and delivers intrigue, unique plotting and
provides a great level of character development and depth. The story
never gets sidetracked, is well paced and, at last, doesn&#x27;t treat the
audience like idiots by explaining everything in detail. You are simply
dropped in and you have to put the pieces together yourself and it
really works well.<br /><br />At the same time, one thing I found a bit mystifying were people who
said that simply didn&#x27;t understand it at all. I find that odd because
the film is ultimately complicated, yet not incomprehensible. It&#x27;s also
great to watch a second and third time.<br /><br />A lot has been said about the ending and people have come away with
different interpretations. I think that&#x27;s worthy of a big hats-off to
the film makers and its been a while since i saw a film that had such a
great closing. With that said, my view was that it was real and the
director was just being a little cheeky because he could! After all,
wouldn&#x27;t you want to throw a fun curve ball in the end if you were
making this film? Overall it&#x27;s highly original, well executed, supreme
production and the stunning soundtrack (and sound effects)deserve a
special mention. Excellent watch and one of the best films in the last
10 years.
