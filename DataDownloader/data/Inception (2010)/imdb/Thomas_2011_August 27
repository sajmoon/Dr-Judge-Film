This movie has been praised by many people. And its very motivated to
ask why? Good science fiction puts you in a state of mind and makes you
think &#x22;there is a chance that this actually can happen.&#x22; That&#x27;s not the
case with this film. Not at all and that is why it fails. Even the
Terminator movies are more believable than this flick, i mean time
travels has been discussed for a very long time and advanced robots
exists today, even if they aren&#x27;t any Terminators to be seen...yet.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has made several great movies, i would say all of his
movies are great in some aspects. Inception is a very creative effort
to say the least. But i seriously wonders if he wasn&#x27;t stoned when he
wrote the script? The good guys are sedated, then connected and then
they get inside someones head - a person who is also connected to the
same neurological network that connects the good guys. Inside the mind
of that person they try to steal ideas or as in this case implant them.
Already here Chris should have given it a second thought, but it gets
worse...<br /><br />The good guys carry weapons just in case the person they&#x27;re trying to
steel from or make an implant in, have a defense. Because if he or she
has, the defense guys will shoot at you. Paus....well armed guys
defending ideas inside someones head? What? The good thing is that if
you get hit you won&#x27;t die, unless you are to deep down...to heavily
sedated that is. Oh....but before you can get inside someones head an
architect must draw the landscape in which the dream sequence will take
place. What??? The film is of course enjoyable, its definitely has its
merits. But ITS NOT the masterpiece some thousand or so morons have
claimed in this forum, its not even close.<br /><br />Batman Begins and The Prestige are his best efforts so far with Memento
very close.
