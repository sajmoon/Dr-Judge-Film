I was waiting for this movies to release , did not get the chance to
see it on the first day , got the tickets on the second day , going in
to the theater my expectation were high and i have to say that Nolan&#x27;s
did not disappoint me at all ,in fact Christopher Nolan and Leonardo Di
Caprio has shown there class . All the side characters in the movie
played there parts well , every actor suits the character they are
playing ,u cant judge the coming scene and many times it will surprise
you ,according to me this is the best movie of the year , Nolan n
Leonardo has shown there class in there respective field , everything
about this movie is refreshing and amazing. The plot of the movie is
planted well enough to keep u at your seats.
