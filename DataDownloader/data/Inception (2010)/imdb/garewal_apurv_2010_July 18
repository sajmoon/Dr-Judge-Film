Christopher Nolan has done it again.<br /><br />Inception is a product of imagination with cleverness.<br /><br />The movie keeps you seated till the end and even after the credits are
over.<br /><br />In whole movie i was saying to myself how can they think like this.<br /><br />Well it has entered my top list with nolan&#x27;s other movies.<br /><br />The expectations from Mr.Nolan were met fully.<br /><br />About the cast,they all have a part to play,so there is nothing
specific about them.all were good.<br /><br />Finally once again hats off to Chris Nolan.Man u r a genius.<br /><br />and in the end i wish to say the dream was very very sweet.
