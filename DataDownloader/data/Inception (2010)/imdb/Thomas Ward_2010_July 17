Inception definitely was on my list of movies I had to see, just
because it was directed by Nolan, who produced the masterpiece that is
The Dark Knight, and it had Leonardo DiCaprio in it. I&#x27;m not a teenage
girl, I was not one of the many that fell in love with him when he fell
in love on a big boat in the second highest grossing film ever,
Titanic. However, I have liked a few of his works from the past,
(especially The Departed) and I was interested in the premise of this
film.<br /><br />*Summary* Inception takes place in an unclear time period, where
technology exists to access someone&#x27;s subconscious. As it explains in
the movie, when you are asleep all your mental protections are lowered,
leaving you vulnerable to thefts like Cobb, Leo&#x27;s role. Cobb uses this
to his advantage, stealing ideas from wealthy business men, giving the
idea to whoever was employing him for that job, and getting his share
of the profit. It was all going peachy, until the wealthiest and most
powerful employer to approach him asks something a little different:
Inception. Instead of stealing an idea, the business man asks Cobb to
plant one.<br /><br />*Acting* The acting was great, as is expected from any Nolan film.
While it is probably impossible to top Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker, Leo and
crew do a good job of keeping the director&#x27;s standards up. There were
some sarcastic and memorable characters (namely Eames), there were by
the book characters (Cobb&#x27;s sidekick, Arthur), and so on and so forth.
The characters were well varied and added a good spice to the movie.<br /><br />*Plot* Possibly my favorite part of any flick is the plot. Maybe that
is why I merely said &#x22;Meh,&#x22; when all others where high of the hype of
Avatar. The plot of Inception is rich and full of multiple layers (no
pun intended to whoever has seen the movie). It is complex and fresh
and it completes this movie.<br /><br />*Effects* Great. Not 3D, so no need for extra charge or the
uncomfortable glasses. This is just simple explosions, instead of
getting into the more expensive and, quite frankly, unnecessary stuff.
I am by no means saying Inceptions effects were bad, just that it was
nice to get away from the 3D craze and realize that effects are really
only the icing, not the actual cake.<br /><br />All in all, the only thing keeping this movie from 10/10 was the
length. It was a a little too long for my tastes. It feels like it
spent a long time explaining all about the idea of extraction (the term
for stealing ideas) and inception before it got to the actual action
and climax. It is a small gripe, however, and it barely takes away from
the whole film.<br /><br />All in all: <br /><br />9/10 stars <br /><br />Definite nominee for Best Picture and numerous other awards based on
current films of the year and future releases.
