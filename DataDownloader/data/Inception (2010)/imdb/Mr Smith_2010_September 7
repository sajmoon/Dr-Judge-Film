This is amazing.. to see how many people were stupified by this movie..<br /><br />Scenario? Original but hardly adequate.. Film direction? Very-very
good, Chris did it again. Acting? OK, I guess. Music? AMAZING!! Hans
Zimmer is THE man!<br /><br />Long story short, the movie was an (almost annoying) continuous attack
of mind-boggling and illogical ideas that (I believe) caught many
people by surprise.. C&#x27;mon people! IMDb score:9.1?? For THIS?? Didn&#x27;t
it bother you that A LOT of things were totally inconsistent, phony and
&#x27;had-to-be-done?&#x27; (like the flow of the move dictated the characters to
make *these* choices, for no logical reason). SOooo unconvincing.. <br /><br />So sad to see so many people&#x27;s mental defenses breach so easily... Next
time I half-expect to see a nicely and aggressively directed popular
soda drink ad, to get a 9 on IMDb..<br /><br />On the pluses, the movie *is* original, direction is awesome, the music
is FANTASTIC. Acting was OK. If they&#x27;d work the movie-logic right
(trust me if FAR from right), then this film would be a great one;
sadly it isn&#x27;t (contrary to what *many* people voted). Personally I
enjoyed it, and I suggested it to my friends as well. Don&#x27;t miss the
opportunity to see that movie, just don&#x27;t get carried away by all this
hype!!<br /><br />Cheers.
