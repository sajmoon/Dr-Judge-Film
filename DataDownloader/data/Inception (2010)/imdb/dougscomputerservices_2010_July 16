The movie has a new and great idea Ha Ha,(The Matrix)but,its too
confusing jumping back and forth from the different levels of the
states of sleep. The average movie viewer won&#x27;t grasp the Conception of
inception. If they would have left it on one level of the dream state I
think it would have been a lot better of a movie. The special effects
were great,but what move now has anything that you haven&#x27;t seen
somewhere already. I just saw this movie and i&#x27;m a big movie buff but,
This movie sucks. If you like special effects and a lot of shoot&#x27;em up,
go for it. As for me it was the worst movie i&#x27;ve seen all this year so
far. I think the people giving it 5 stars are in a dream of inception.
