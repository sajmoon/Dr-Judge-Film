148 minutes of absolute brilliance. This is one hell of a film.<br /><br />This is a film that for once isn&#x27;t the same old rubbish. Its original,
well thought out, complex at times and makes you think ever step of the
148 minutes.<br /><br />Anyone who wants the whole plot of a film in the first 10 minutes see
something else.<br /><br />The people who like to think about what your watching - this is for
you, Hollywood at its best with a fantastic Hanz Zimmer OST.<br /><br />Fantastic acting.<br /><br />Fantastic Score.
