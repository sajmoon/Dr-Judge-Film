The Nolan brothers are at their best.<br /><br />This is a movie not to be missed. This is how one should make an action
movie where the plot matters the most. The best movie I saw since The
Dark Knight. Yes, best since then. No movie had left me wanting for
more. Nolan brothers have done it again. After seeing this wonderful
masterpiece I am compelled to review. Ever since I saw Memento, I
decided that if a movie by Nolan brothers is coming out, then it&#x27;s a
must watch.<br /><br />This is the next most complicated script I have seen next to Memento
(by Nolan brothers). What makes their movie so special and innovative ?
It&#x27;s the script, direction and class-A dialogs. Yes, if you are
watching a Nolan brothers movie better pay attention. And this movie
needs the highest attention. Miss one bit and you will end up confused
wondering how you got there. The movie starts with a layout explaining
all the basic elements in the first 1 hr. Once the action part kicks
you&#x27;ll be glued to the screen praising and awing scene after scene. At
the end, the movie will leave you to figure the conclusion on your own.
In short, it will make you think about the complexity of sub-conscious
human mind.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio gives a solid awesome performance in handling the
weight and pressure of human emotions. Next best performance is given
by Marian Cortilard. Ellen Page does a fair job and so do the other
supporting characters. The direction, a complete genius, Christopher
Nolan is. Every scene and layer will keep you stunned momentarily.
Music, though it sounded like more like Batman, seemed to fit well for
this movie, hence I loved it. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this movie
receives an Oscar and so rightly it deserves one and more than one.<br /><br />In short, Inception is not a deception. It goes well beyond all the
hype and expectations.<br /><br />Thank you, the Nolan brothers...
