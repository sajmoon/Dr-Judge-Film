There a very few film directors in this world that are allowed to pitch
a complex and completely original concept to a studio and walk away
with a budget to the tune of $200 million and make it, that said your
name is Christopher Nolan and your last movie was The Dark Knight that
did break all box office receipts, so exception granted.<br /><br />With Inception Nolan invites you into the world of the dream to explore
alternate realities where the rules don&#x27;t exist and this all sounds
intriguing for a film that is essentially at it&#x27;s core is a perfect
classic heist story.<br /><br />The story sees Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is an extractor paid by
sinister corporations who makes a questionable living by stealing the
innermost ideas of powerful tycoons. He does so by infiltrating their
dreams with the help of a team of operatives and a mysterious
dream-sharing device. But then, as if fate had decided after a failed
attempt at extracting information from one business executive Saito
(Ken Watanabe, The Last Samurai), he is offered a job by the very same
man. This time, however, must plant a new idea &#x27;Inception&#x27; in the
competitor&#x27;s mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy, Batman
Begins), rather than extract it.<br /><br />Nolan has ensemble a stellar cast to play out this story but it
DiCaprio who gives an astonishing almost flawless like performance and
his best since Blood Diamond to steal the show and surely it is finally
time for that first Oscar to be awarded. He is backed up by his right
hand man, the Organiser Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, (500) Days of
Summer), Forger (Tom Hardy,RocknRolla) who gives a humorous
performance. Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies) gives the film its
emotional weight playing Cobb&#x27;s wife Mal, Ellen Page (Ariadne) finally
manages to step out from under the Juno stereotype, playing the
Architect who is suspicious of Cobb&#x27;s motives. Then there are the Nolan
regulars Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine, all of whom
are vastly underused but nevertheless are still a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The visual effects in &#x27;Inception&#x27; are nothing short of breathless and
are of the original kind that haven&#x27;t been since like the Matrix, where
you have exploding buildings, folding cities to zero-gravity suspended
bodies. If that&#x27;s not enough, there is also one sequence reminiscent of
a James Bond movie with the team members decked out in matching winter
gear and skis, fighting their way across a snowy landscape, whilst all
the time these effects are beating to a pulsating Hans Zimmer score.<br /><br />Nolan really as outshone himself here since creating that near perfect
movie of The Dark Knight two years ago, Inception is a bold, inventive
and complex piece of film at heart and one that will take multiple
viewings to fully appreciate beauty and genius from different
perspectives that was much needed like The Usual Suspects and to flush
out any flaws, if any. We know Christopher Nolan has signed on for
Batman 3, but can he really top this&#x85;5*****
