Nolan is back with another blockbuster.. The movie stuns you throughout
from the beginning to the end. The movie begins in a dream and keeps
you guessing whether your out of it or no? Leonardo DiCaprio and his
group are fabulous. The story is really great. The only small drawback
is the end where its a bit complicated.I recommend you to catch this
movie in theatre.. AND NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE SCREEN OR YOU MIGHT
MISS OUT SOMETHING. A Brief of the movie.. The movie starts in a dream
where Leo is lost..this scene continues at the end. So watch this
blockbuster and don&#x27;t give it a miss.now he is on a task to get a
secret from a mans sub consciouses..now he fails due to his dead wife
who keep disturbing him from time to time. there has been a case
charged against Leo for killing his wife. Now the person whom he tried
to steal an idea he offers a job of &#x27;INCEPTION&#x27; he is offered a job to
plant an idea into a mans mind to split up his company so he can be
safe Leo agrees.. Now they gather on the subject and bring him into a
dream.the fun part comes here in the 2nd half where Leo enters dreams
to complete his job.they enter 4 dreams all of them within dreams and
finally he succeeds and movie comes to an end with a suspense and a
chance for a sequel. My rating is 9/10.
