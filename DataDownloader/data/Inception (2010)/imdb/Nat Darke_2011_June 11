I will rate this movie on characters/script, acting, plot, production
and an x-factor. <br /><br />The characters in this movie have no personality or depth. Worse,
because you cannot sympathise with them in any way, they add a clich&#xE9;d
sob story for the main character, to fill the gap left by a clinical
inability to project any humanity onto him, through the use of
dialogue. Score = 1/10. <br /><br />The acting is OK. Average. But with no characters to act, I would
imagine this isn&#x27;t hard. Score = 3/10. <br /><br />The plot is complicated (for a movie), fast paced and based on the most
spurious, simplistic and quasi-scientific description of the human
mind. It demands that you concentrate to keep up, so it is very
disappointing to realise that your efforts are unrewarded. There are
logical, philosophical, scientific and psychological flaws with every
turn of the plot, and it isn&#x27;t even consistent in these. This makes it
a very boring movie to watch so a big fat 1/10 for plot. <br /><br />Production is good. Nice special effects with a big budget. 7/10. <br /><br />So far we have 12/40, which is 3/10. This means I would have to give
-7/10 for x-factor, in order to arrive at a final score of 1/10, which
is what this movie deserves, because it claims to be so much that it is
not. So x-factor gets -7/10 exactly.
