Now we know what to do when we do not have a story but a bunch of bucks
to make a movie: simply throw in some action, get Hans Zimmer in and
make a whole lot of marketing efforts to get all of us dummies in
summertime in the theaters and here you have Inception. What simply
gets enormously annoying in the movie: every time you have the
impression that the storyline is in a &#x22;dream&#x22;, it seems that is a dream
within a dream, and than that dream within the dream is in a
dream...come on...!! Leanordo Di Caprio is splendid as always, the
female co-actors are too dull for words. 2 stars for the action
elements, 2 stars for Hans Zimmer and 1 for the effort,but no more, no
more!
