...so I can relive the experience of watching Inception for the first
time again!. It is easy to hype up any film as the best movie of the
year/decade etc. But calling Inception those will be, IMO, missing the
point. Forget about the intricacies of the plot, the science, plot
holes (if any) - it is Inception&#x27;s ability to surprise and engage the
audience the way it does, that makes it an unmissable experience. <br /><br />Typically movies that claim to offer such intellectual stimulation tend
to be preachy and pretentious. In that respect Inception beams with
humility and never overwhelms you with more than what is necessary for
the story to progress. <br /><br />Avatar was taunted as bridging the distance between the movie and the
audience. After watching Inception, you will realise how miserably it
failed. Inception pulls you in for the ride from the word go. And the
more the film progresses the deeper and deeper you feel yourself going.
Nolan will guide your mind through the mazes. When the film finishes
and the screen goes black, it catapults you back to reality so fast,
you will be on your seat for a few more seconds than usual, lost for
words, probably disoriented and wanting to talk about the movie but not
knowing where to start. That night, you will go to bed prepared. Sweet
dreams.
