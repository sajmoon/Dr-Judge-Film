In this day and age, the term &#x27;summer blockbuster&#x27; has become somewhat
degrading. It implies mindless entertainment. Inception is a summer
blockbuster but also a legitimate motion picture. It is a well thought
out, inventive story which flirts with surrealism, expressionism, and
post-modernism, and I suppose literally speaking, futurism too. Despite
being convoluted, the story is rhythmic, but you do have to focus. This
is not a film for the weak of mind.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan presents a future where man can control dreams. Cobb
makes a living from stealing the dreams of others, but since being
accused of killing his wife, he has fled the United States and in now
in Japan. An executive gives Cobb the chance to return home free of
charge if he does a job for him. The mission: assemble a crew and enter
the mind of Robert Fisher Jr. (the son of a dying corporate emperor.)
Cobb must put the idea in Jr.&#x27;s head to bring down his father&#x27;s work.
Needless to say, It is a very dangerous game, and if he screws up he
could be stuck in a dream for who knows how long.<br /><br />To call Incaption ambitious would be an understatement. It is so
complex that one must wonder how this could be pulled off. In the
course of two and a half hours, Inception takes us to a dream within a
dream within a dream, but Nolan ensures that his viewer stays focused
and entertained.<br /><br />Inception is not a very demanding script for acting, but the lead role
of Cobb does require more than a little investment. Leo DiCaprio does
the job well. Even though (facially speaking) he will always look like
the same twenty year old standing on the bow of the Titanic, he feels
like a man in this motion picture. <br /><br />I liked the ending of this film. You kind of expect it in the sense
that it would be unlike Chris Nolan to do something conventional, so
there is a tiny little twist, appropriate is size, it doesn&#x27;t feel too
cheaply done. <br /><br />If you commit yourself, You&#x27;ll find that Inception delivers the goods.
It ain&#x27;t an easy movie, but it is definitely a good watch for movie.
