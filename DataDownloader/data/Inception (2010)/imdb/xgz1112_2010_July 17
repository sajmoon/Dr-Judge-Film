This movie is absolutely amazing. When you leave the theater you won&#x27;t
just say &#x22;Wow, I&#x27;m glad I saw that movie&#x22;, although you certainly will,
you will also say and think &#x22;Oh my gosh, what if this is possible?&#x22;. To
a point everyone knows it&#x27;s not, but the idea portrayed by this movie
is insane. I&#x27;ll keep it short:<br /><br />Story:9.5/10 Special Effects:10/10 Acting:10/10<br /><br />Half the reason this movie is so awesome is because it makes you think.
How often does a movie or a show every make people really think, hard.
They say the human brain only uses 10% of its potential, this movie
successfully increases that, temporary albeit, to maybe 15 percent. Of
course that&#x27;s just my speculation.
