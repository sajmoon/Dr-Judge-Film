Inception is amazingly original, but also very overwhelming. Inception
is not your typical brainless action movie. It contains great acting by
Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and others. It also has a
great script by Christopher Nolan and a great direction by Nolan also.
The cinematography is unbelievable. Some scenes in the movie actually
blew my mind.<br /><br />The movie is about Cobb (DiCaprio) who lives in a world where
technology exists to enter the human mind through dream invasion, he is
a highly skilled thief who is given a final chance at redemption which
involves executing his toughest job to date: Inception.<br /><br />The movie involves many rules about dreams. I won&#x27;t get into them
because it may be considered spoilers.<br /><br />I&#x27;m gonna say watch it. No matter what kind of movies you&#x27;re into.
