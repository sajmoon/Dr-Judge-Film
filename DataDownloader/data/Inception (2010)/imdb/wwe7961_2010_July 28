Christopher Nolan has given us a smart film that is appealing to the
eyes as well as the brain. The visuals are used in a way that makes
things feel like an amazing dream. The story is interesting, and the
actors all do a great job. Leonardo Dicaprio as usual is fantastic.
Others like Micheal Kane and Ellen Page also are great. The film is
much like The Matrix, but I find Inception to be even better then it.
Many have complained that it was too complicated. Many will need to
watch it another time to get it, but I understood it well. Does
Inception need a sequel? I don&#x27;t think so. I say it should be left
alone as a classic. Is it as good as The Dark Knight? No, but does it
have to be.<br /><br />4 stars out of 4
