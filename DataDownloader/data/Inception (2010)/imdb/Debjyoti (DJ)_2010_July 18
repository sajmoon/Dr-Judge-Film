In the time of remakes, Nolan brings frontward something so original
that it&#x27;s hard to evade.<br /><br />Let me put this straight; &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a kind of mind buster if
appropriate attention is given, viewers will be suitably rewarded. It&#x27;s
not the typical popcorn flick which we have got used to so often.<br /><br />By this time I guess everyone got little bit of idea on the plot; In
short <br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a kind of specialist who has the skill
to get inside people&#x27;s dream and steal their ideas for various reasons.
During one such assignment the subject (dreamer) being aware of Cobb&#x27;s
real intension jeopardizes the mission. However impressed by Cobb&#x27;s
skill he is offered a new task for self redemption. Instead of stealing
a dream he needs to implant one in a key business tycoon&#x27;s mind which
will lead to known repercussion in real world.<br /><br />That being said lets talk about the casting.<br /><br />The cast assembled for this movie is more than perfect; DiCaprio&#x27;s role
was well balanced by Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard and Joseph Levitt. In
various reviews I came across people tetchy about less character
development other than Leo; well I guess that is how Nolan wanted to
tell his story. Ultimately it all depends on how we interpret.<br /><br />Action sequence infused within the movie was simply &#x22;amazing&#x22; and the
pace was very much accelerated by Hans Zimmer&#x27;s pulsating score.<br /><br />The essence of the movie can be felt with its beautiful cinematography
for which credit should definitely be given to Walter Pfister.<br /><br />In short this is a masterpiece and should never be missed in the
theaters.<br /><br />Time has come for us to leave behind memoirs of &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; and
move ahead to accept Christopher Nolan&#x27;s new great work &#x22;Inception&#x22;<br /><br />This movie will beyond doubt be the theme to lots of movie enthusiast
caf&#xE9; talk for the months to come. Remember Memento... :)
