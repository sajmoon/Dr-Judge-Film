I&#x27;m not often driven to write a review but this needs to be said.
Billed with rave reviews expectation was high, but this film is totally
over rated, Unengaging, uninteresting &#x26; down-rite boring.. at best
contrived &#x26; designed to bamboozle the General viewing demographic into
believing it is an amazing masterful multi layered work of Genius, in
fact its simply a long winded futile effort at re-branding the matrix
concept of virtual reality.... The first hour is taken up by efforts to
convince and educate the Audience at the lowest intellectual level, so
anyone with half an &#x27;o&#x27;level awaits the actual story with Grinding
misery... when eventually the director feels we are up to speed what we
have in store is just a jumbled overly contrived story of not
particularly interesting content.. the only redeeming feature this film
has to offer is a fleeting philosophical moment of &#x22;what if....&#x22; please
take a pillow and a book if you choose to endure this films transparent
2hrs+ of flashing lights loud atmospheric musical score... I&#x27;m
generally a positive glass is half full kinda Guy.. but this is
definitely an empty cigarette-butt tainted post hangover stale beer
bottle of a film....
