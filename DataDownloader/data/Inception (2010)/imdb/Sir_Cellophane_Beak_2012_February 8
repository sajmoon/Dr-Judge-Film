Inception starts off as a &#x27;Been there, Seen that&#x27; yawn of a movie. In
true Bollywood style, it rehashes Action from &#x27;PAPRIKA&#x27; (Japanese anime
show from 2006 and a plot more than loosely based on it.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, who is slowly establishing himself as an actor par
excellence with every movie he signs, especially when you see how lame
the action looks in the context. But then, about fifteen minutes into
the movie, something happens that has one rivetted to their seat for
the next two hours. the scenes stolen from &#x27;Paprika&#x27; begin. The more
said about Paprika, the better it gets. Cinematography is great while
stunts though inspired from PAPRIKA are different those days though
many are too similar to PAPRIKA and seem tepid compared to them.<br /><br />Ripping off action sequences or plot ideas from Hollywood movies is not
something new but c&#x27;mon! There was no originality whatsoever! Of course
the action scenes have been stolen from Japanes animes, but seems good
in the movie. At least it was an American movie with crisp action
scenes. And DiCapprio really suits the action scenes pretty well. But
the main power of the movie is its sense of &#x22;Paprikishness&#x22;.... Once
that is over, the picture takes turn for worse.<br /><br />And if the &#x27;PAPRIKA&#x27; was a highest level profanation. &#x27;INCEPTION&#x27; is
more vital, honest and rough as a sand-paper on pseudo-intellectual
skin of Western cinema maniacs.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio once again stands tall with his superb performance -
his desperation depicted both through his eyes and body language is a
treat to watch. Cillian Murphy was kind of revelation to me - first
time I realized, that even this guy can act. Quite a few things in the
movie may not seem realistic, but all is compensated by a good
presentation. Well Done!!
