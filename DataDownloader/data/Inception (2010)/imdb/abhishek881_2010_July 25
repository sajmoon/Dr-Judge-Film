&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a surreal dream ride taken by the audience during the
time the movie unfolds its composite and intricate elements. The movie
is masterfully crafted by Mr. Nolan and wonderfully acted by Leonardo
DiCaprio and the respective cast. The enormity of this motion picture
is enclosed in its depiction of visual splendour handsomely showcased
by the beautiful graphics the movie boasts off.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; leaves you spellbound, intrigued, and puzzled. The art of
making the reality seem like a fragment of our imagination is
masterfully invented by Mr. Nolan. I use the word invented because this
movie is like no other in comparison. Comparing it with another movie
would be ridiculing the genius of the fine talent which has gone in
making this incredible movie into a cult success.<br /><br />The story captures our senses, as it draws in our knowledge and turns
it into mere a delusion. Our thoughts and ideas are mere imagination in
the world of Mr. Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22;. The result is a mixed concoction
of &#x22;projections&#x22; (no pun intended), projected by us at the end of the
movie.<br /><br />To sum it all, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is most definitely the movie of the decade
as it deserves to be awarded that title. It makes us question
ourselves. It makes us believe in the thought of stealing ideas from
others. It makes us believe in the reality which doesn&#x27;t exist. If all
this is not the example of intelligent and smart film making then what
is? <br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; delivers on the needs and wants of audience of all ages. It
is bona fide science fiction. More than that, it is Christopher Nolan
at his best.
