Inception is a puzzlebloxbuster, a Momento for those with Matrix-
withdrawal. It&#x27;s a long film but, unlike The Dark Knight, it doesn&#x27;t
feel like it; it&#x27;s a disturbing, exhilarating hit, never boring even
when it&#x27;s baffling.<br /><br />Littered with Nolanisms (Nolanemes?) it moves ahead with great economy,
with mute flashbacks over present dialogue and jumps ahead when he
considers we&#x27;re getting the idea. It&#x27;s also got a clear smattering of
movie-fan homages, from the coup in a Chinese domesticity that recalls
the opium den of Once Upon A Time In America to a clearly Kubrickian
scene, borrowed from 2001. This - and the post-Bourne, boys-own
conflagration of action-adventure - makes for a terrific afternoon at
the pictures on its own.<br /><br />However, this is no straightforward grand-concept &#x26; romp. Nolan has
substantial points to make about the contingency of image - the nature
of what we believe we can see with our own eyes. He manages this rather
tricky, layered storytelling rather well. I enjoyed the acting
contribution in this, a cast trusting in the outlandish sci-fi of the
situation, behaving without the arched-eyebrows of dissociating irony.
Leo DiCaprio is very good in this type of role, although he&#x27;s done his
best work in this line for Martin Scorsese, principally in The
Departed.<br /><br />Two caveats. Firstly Ellen Page&#x27;s Ariadne is too jejune to be a
convincing psychoanalytic foil for DiCaprio. I didn&#x27;t believe her.
Secondly, this film doesn&#x27;t have the economy of Momento. This is
largely because of its visual scale. But it&#x27;s also, necessarily, a
chatty sort of flick, and though Nolan has managed the drama-exposition
balance very well what he hasn&#x27;t done is managed the sound mix at all.
I focused hard on this film, knowing something of Nolan&#x27;s style and
oeuvre and missed many crucial exchanges through no fault of mine or my
cinema&#x27;s.<br /><br />Having said that, this may be the perfect excuse to go and see it for
the inevitable second time. 8/10
