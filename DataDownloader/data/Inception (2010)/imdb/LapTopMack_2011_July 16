I wish to god that IMDb would allow you to vote with a minus rating
because, if I could i would rate this movie -10. This is the all time
worst movie of my life and I want the 2 and a half hours back. While
watching this junk I actually thought i was dreaming and in a bad
nightmare, then the phone rang and I realized that I was just watching
a horrible peace of sh!!!!T. I actually signed up for this site just
for this dirty peace of toilet paper they call a script. I had to watch
this movie in four parts not being able to stomach more than 40 minutes
at a time. <br /><br />To keep it plain and simple I would not even make someone on death row
watch this movie even if it was his last request. Let me plant an
Inception in your head and tell you not to watch this movie. It&#x27;s
movies like this that put Block Buster out of business and why movie
sales are down.
