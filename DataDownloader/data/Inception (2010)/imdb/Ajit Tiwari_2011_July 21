Inception itself suggests the beginning of something and for what
Christopher Nolan is renowned.<br /><br />This is an example of the litheness of dream, where you can find
yourself somewhere on the globe without knowing the path. Christopher
Nolan has proved it once again after &#x22;The Following&#x22; &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22; , &#x22;The Dark Night&#x22; that he is here for the makeover of the
contemporary cinema.<br /><br />Inception is surreal and Nolan used incongruous juxtapositions in order
to represent unconscious thoughts and dreams. The dominion of
surrealism is unidentified and tenuous, when we endeavor to concoct it,
the aftermath can go off beam.<br /><br />This movie displays the ahead of its time planet where we can intercept
human minds through dream foray and we can make them alter their mental
picture. <br /><br />Leonardo Dicaprio plays the role flawlessly and effortlessly as he is
one of finest actors. He blatantly gets into the character and exhibits
the real intricacies and restrictions of Cobb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has
an embellishing screen presence, Ken Watanabe is excellent and Ellen
Page is not lost among the stars. Marion Cotillard is wonderful
depicting her pain and mental suffering as, Mal.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s is unsurpassed and exceptionally creative,Inception is an
epitome of his brilliance.
