This is one of the best films I&#x27;ve seen for some time... and yes, this
is quite some time as the cinema seems to lost its soul - just as
today&#x27;s music.<br /><br />This movie can be seen as a collage of some best popular culture movies
as The Matrix, eXistenZ, 13th Floor, The Cell, even Ocean&#x27;s 11! But it
also has a unique originality.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things to observe is seeing how different
reactions are given to the movie. Pay attention to the ones who hated
the film; all their review are shouting as &#x22;I am soo intelligent and
complicated and so above everybody else that, I hated this movie and
shame on morons who liked this crap&#x22;. So, here&#x27;s a hypothesis; this
movie can be used as an indicator to understand the &#x22;ego :
intelligence&#x22; ratio of a person. Once you hear a person say &#x22;oh I hated
Inception, so poor script, so bad movie blahblahblah&#x22;, run like hell!
Probably the ego is seriously inflated and the existence is stuck in
his/her &#x22;brilliant&#x22; mind like forever.<br /><br />For others - who really liked the movie, saw how many levels this movie
really has - this is a gem worth to watch couple of times. In the end
all of us are free to choose the dream we&#x27;re stuck in - and here&#x27;s the
annoying truth; yes, we&#x27;re all stuck somewhere.
