Inception is one of the greatest movies of all times. The idea that you
have in your mind before you watch Inception will be stolen by
Christopher Nolan, the superb excellently talented director who keeps
on blowing your mind from time to time. Leonardo DiCaprio is another
charm of the movie, he will wake you up from your dreams of what you
think or what you are thinking about the movie. The excellent idea of
the movie, the story and everything else including the music by Hans
Zimmer will shock you. Trust me you might have seen thousands of movies
but this one is entirely different and better than 10,000 of those you
haven&#x27;t seen yet! Avatar is a movie to compare, well it was an
experience but if you compare these two i would definitely go with
INCEPTION. <br /><br />INCEPTION is a must watch. If you miss this one, you&#x27;ll regret it
forever! GO AND WATCH IT. I could only rate it 10 if there were 1000
stars for it i would click every star. Truly Amazing and its still
running in my mind.
