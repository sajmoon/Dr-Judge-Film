Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about
half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every
passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry
on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it&#x27;s not fair to
rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I&#x27;m not a
masochist.<br /><br />This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on
movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with
the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic
story, but great marketing: Box office success.<br /><br />You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting
before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people&#x27;s dreams,
creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can
interact with each other, and in this way, collect important
information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams
within, and it&#x27;s hard to know what is real and when your&#x27;re dreaming.<br /><br />Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than
because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the
quality of the film.<br /><br />This film&#x27;s whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams
for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the
dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so
consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and
heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the
ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd
sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.<br /><br />I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However,
my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is
rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very
generous score.
