Inception is a highly original, thoughtful, and incredibly entertaining
sci-fi/thriller romp and comes with a hearty recommendation.<br /><br />The direction, acting, script, action and special effects are all
super-tight. There are a few points where the script falls down very
slightly, but in the bigger picture of the movie as a whole these are
relatively inconsequential, and similarly there are a couple of lines
that maybe aren&#x27;t as well-delivered as they could&#x27;ve been, but again,
overall the cast does a superb job.<br /><br />The pacing in the film is fantastic - there&#x27;s a perfect balance of
exposition mixed with action and although Inception is a long movie, it
doesn&#x27;t feel that way when you&#x27;re watching it, and despite quite a lot
of time spent of exposition, the film never stagnates, and keeps
popping along at a fairly furious pace. Evening the opening act during
which the plot and characters are established is dealt with in perfect
time, and I never felt a desire for them to &#x27;just get on with it.&#x27; The
core of the film is a philosophical and existential dilemma regarding
the nature of reality. Thematically, it parallels The Matrix extremely
closely, but the actual plot of the film, as well as the details of its
setting, are extremely original. The only reason I might NOT recommend
this film is if you&#x27;re tired of movies on this kind of topic. It is a
very good take on the issue, but if you&#x27;re tired of that whole area
altogether it might be best to give this a miss.<br /><br />The entire movie was very tasteful in terms of maintaining a feeling of
mystery and ambiguity. I sometimes feel that movies of this type have a
tendency to over-explain, instead of leaving more up to audience
interpretation. I felt that Inception struck a perfect balance between
explaining enough not to be frustrating, but keeping enough ambiguous
to hold interest after the credits roll.<br /><br />This is a movie that I&#x27;d really like to see expanded upon with a
sequel. There&#x27;s a lot of potential here that wasn&#x27;t tapped in the film
to show on-screen some really incredible dream-like or nightmarish
imagery. The special effects in the movie were fantastic, but they
could&#x27;ve done more in terms of showing surreal circumstance,
architecture, and characters. There was no time for it in this film,
and it wouldn&#x27;t have quite fit, but it&#x27;d be an excellent area to expand
on.<br /><br />Inception is an excellent film, and one that I think will become a
staple science fiction movie.
