Like most of the movie goers I have been tired of the kind of
unoriginal and mindless movies being dished out (with the exception of
&#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;). &#x22;Inception&#x22; is one movie that was worth the wait.<br /><br />The positives for the movie: 1. Its layered narrative. You have to keep
yourself aware where they started from to connect the dots and make
sense of what is going on.<br /><br />2. The movie challenges the movie viewer. In my opinion, it is high
time movie makers stop thinking of the audience as a bunch of morons.<br /><br />3. Its gripping and draws the viewer completely in so much so that you
lose track of reality yourself.<br /><br />4. I don&#x27;t know how Nolan managed to write the screen play for this
movie. Its a piece of work.<br /><br />5. The background score was perfect for the movie. To me it enhanced
the turmoil of the world of dreams.<br /><br />6. The cast of the movie. Each and every actor was perfect for the
role. Since &#x22;The Departed&#x22; I have started believing that DiCaprio is
one of the best actors of his generation along with Depp. Tom Hardy is
good. Its great to see Michael Caine on screen. Every time you see him,
it calms down your tense nerves. However, Marion Cotillard takes the
cake as Mal. Her performance is very conflicted and intense. I think
her character is the closest to the viewer&#x27;s mindset during the movie.<br /><br />There are not many negatives. Anyways, here they are: 1. The plot of
the movie is very thin. If not for so many layers, it could be told in
a few lines.<br /><br />2. Some elements were forced, especially some humor.<br /><br />3. You don&#x27;t feel a lot of emotional connection for anyone except may
be a slight one for Cobb.
