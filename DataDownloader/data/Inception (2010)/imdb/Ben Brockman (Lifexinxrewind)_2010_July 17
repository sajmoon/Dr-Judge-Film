After a night&#x27;s reflection (and much discussion) I reward Christopher
Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece &#x22;Inception&#x22; a perfect rating, one of only a handful
of movies I&#x27;ve ever given that rating to. The man who blew me away with
&#x22;Memento,&#x22; &#x22;The Prestige,&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; has easily solidified
himself as the greatest filmmaker of the last decade in my opinion. <br /><br />How good is &#x22;Inception?&#x22; It&#x27;s already in my top 10 movies of all time.
It might even be top 5. Time will tell if it holds up as well on repeat
viewings, but I was blown away many times in the theater in ways I
haven&#x27;t felt since I saw the original Matrix. This film features
special effects that you seriously have to see to believe. It has a
superbly crafted plot, complicated enough to demand the viewer&#x27;s full
attention but presented in a way that doesn&#x27;t cheat or degenerate into
nonsense. Much like the plot itself, there are many layers to the film
that manages to combine so many well known genres, rolling it all
together into one of the most unique experiences I&#x27;ve had. It is almost
like experiencing two or three amazing movies at once. <br /><br />It&#x27;s easy to tell how much work and dedication went into the making of
this film. Christopher Nolan has a lot on his mind and it&#x27;s rare to
find a movie that simultaneously pulls off being such an entertaining
summer blockbuster while existing as a work of psychologically
challenging art. A perfect cast of characters are paired with an
amazing score by Hans Zimmer, and &#x22;Inception&#x22; flies through it&#x27;s
extended running time by taking the intensity meter up to 11 and
leaving it there for over half of its runtime. The viewer barely has a
chance to catch their breath while taking in all the twists, turns, and
to borrow a phrase from Neo, &#x22;Whoa&#x22; moments. It is easily the best film
to come out since The Dark Knight. You have simply never seen something
quite like this before.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has gained so much respect by demanding attention to
detail from his audience, never insulting them, but always staying a
few steps ahead. It&#x27;s rare for a film to live up to the hype (which I&#x27;m
no doubt adding to with this review) but trust me when I say this is
the kind of movie that makes a great barometer for other critics. To
put it bluntly, I can&#x27;t trust a movie review from someone that can&#x27;t
enjoy this movie on some level.<br /><br />As this thrill ride of a film was coming to a close, and the theater
audience was reacting to the final frame, I confirmed to myself what I
had thought several times during the film: &#x22;Inception&#x22; is something
special.
