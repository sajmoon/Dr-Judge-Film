2010_October 9 
I completely understand those who gave a perfect 10. But I am not
necessarily one of them, am I? One simple question: well, what does
Nolan exactly want to say? It is not so much related to &#x22;dreams&#x22;,
seemed to me, rather, it is about our natural ability to embrace or
evade the good, the bad, and the ultimate void of our existence.<br /><br />Through dreams, it just became easier to explain. However, when you
cool down the mind blown by the imaginative scenes and cuts and lines,
you shall ask yourself, &#x22;do I have to have a three-level dream to
confront and finally evade the haunting late wife?&#x22; The answer might be
yes, so you will give a 10. And the answer could be no, so the score
will be 8, like what I gave.<br /><br />In one word, the movie is just too complicated for a purpose that easy.<br /><br />Maybe because I have seen &#x22;Paprika&#x22;, a Japanese animated feature
directed by Satoshi, Kon, the late famous Japanese animation director.
He created a story that, seen by now, is a perfect basis on which Nolan
drafted his. I am not saying who is stealing whose ideas of what, but I
am implying (very clearly) that technically, Nolan is being derivative.<br /><br />One &#x22;problem&#x22;, I might call it that way, is the deliberately prolonged
fighting scene before the vehicle touched the water. Yes, I understand
that makes sense of the relativity theory, yet, it is just too long for
a movie.<br /><br />If you have a critic&#x27;s eyes, you shall admit that the art direction,
the cinematography, the original score, the sound and visual effects
and the editing are just wonderful, if not state-of-the art. Yet, these
cannot defy the facts that once again, it is just a movie about a
troubled man with a troubling wife whose troubles will not be solved if
one or both of them choose to disappear or stay far away from each
other...If you replace the word &#x22;wife&#x22; with the words that I mentioned
in the second paragraph, especially the negative ones, you will get
what this movie is actually talking about...<br /><br />Take or leave it.
