The reviews that call this &#x22;genius&#x22; are just ridiculous. The plot was
so overwhelmingly incredulous that even the most open minded movie goer
would find this plain brain dead.<br /><br />I love the long mundane reviews of this &#x22;work of art&#x22;/&#x22;masterpiece&#x22;.
How much were you fools paid to write such garbage.<br /><br />Half through my son summed it up best when he asked &#x22;dad, is it almost
done yet?&#x22; Enough said.<br /><br />3 thumbs down from our group and 8 thumbs down from co-workers.<br /><br />Odd, my own little cross section severely diverges from the reviews in
IMDb......hmmmm..
