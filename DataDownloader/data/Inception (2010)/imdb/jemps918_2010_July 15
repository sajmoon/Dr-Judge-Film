Super blown away by Inception! I can&#x27;t get over how Christopher Nolan
can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to
see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should
have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!! <br /><br />He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it
down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well
that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you
forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the
ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I
could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!
