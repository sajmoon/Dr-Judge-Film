One has to look no further than at this two and one half hour bag of
hot air to understand why American film is on life support. In what
would have made for an absorbing thirty minute Twilight Zone episode in
the mid sixties has been (through the wonder of technology) turned into
a flashy and noisy blockbuster as director Chris Nolan applies lipstick
to this pig by the bucket. <br /><br />Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) is a dream stealer in a land and time not far
from now. He&#x27;s particularly valuable to corporations keen on getting an
edge on competitors but now in order to go legit and see his kiddies
again he must do the reverse. Impossible you say, not in Chris Nolan&#x27;s
fantasy land of computer generated gimmickry and circuitous dialog.<br /><br />Inception&#x27;s slick dishonesty lies in the parallel universe of the real
and unreal worlds Nolan creates in an attempt to humanize its
disheveled super hero by giving it a patina of reality and generate
sympathy for Cobb. But Cobb along with everyone else acts like a
stilted automaton (or Joe Friday from Dragnet) and while it try&#x27;s
redistributing its weight to give balance to the money shots (you know
the fireworks) it comes across mawkish and syrupy. The premise itself
is hashed and rehashed ad nauseum and so much one gets the idea that
the producers are not only attempting to blind with shock and awe but
confuse you with non-sequitors in hopes of successfully cloning you to
buy another ticket.<br /><br />Even in the real world it is based Inception remains a fairy tale
working off the borderless freedom of fantasy where things don&#x27;t have
to be logical just convenient. Nolan was far more successful in
bringing the fantasy reality factor closer together in Insomnia and
Memento. There was a grittier tension in these low budgets that Nolan
has lost since hitting the big time and having at his disposal a huge
budget for all star casts ( mostly wasted in minor roles here) and
exotic locales to play out his ideas. These productions (Batmans plus
The Prestige) may spare no expense but they lack soul and usually
flounder mid way.<br /><br />While the blame can be clearly affixed to the the shoulders of writer,
producer, director Nolan I would be remiss not to acknowledge
cinematographer Wally Pfister&#x27;s murky and dull compositions and Hans
Zimmers relentless music score which plays like a leaky faucet
throughout the entire film. Like an IV it attempts to transfuse
suspense into the plot with an annoying undercurrent and the occasional
crash of brass.
