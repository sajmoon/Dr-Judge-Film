i might be in the minority here but i was not blown away by this
film.don&#x27;t get me wrong.i enjoyed,ans it&#x27;s well made,and has an
interesting concept(the art of stealing a person&#x27;s secrets from their
subconscious while they are dreaming.but to me,it didn&#x27;t(or couldn&#x27;t)
live up to the hype.it has its good point.it isn&#x27;t boring and the
acting is first rate,especially by Leonardo DiCaprio.i liked the look
of the film too.many people i know have said it was so complex that
they had to watch it more than once to understand it.i don&#x27;t agree.i
didn&#x27;t find it complex at all.think it&#x27;s well worth watching,but like i
said,It just had too much hype to live up to.but that&#x27;s just me
opinion.for me,Inception is a 7/10
