Christopher Nolan&#x27;s latest film attempts to explore its complexity with
only modest success. It became instantly one of the most highly
anticipated films of the summer when the trailer was first released,
many expected it to be a mind bending science fiction film. Instead,
the film succeeds largely due to its strong cast and sometimes
breathtaking visuals.<br /><br />Nolan has been one of the shining lights of the film industry directing
the brilliant Memento, the imaginative The Prestige and for
resurrecting the Batman trilogy. This is Nolan&#x27;s first original
screenplay since his debut The Following. And unfortunately he shows
the rust.<br /><br />The film stars in-form Leonardo Dicaprio, the enchanting Marian
Cottilard, and a strong supporting cast including Ellen Page and Joseph
Gordon-Levitt. The story centres on Dicaprio&#x27;s character Cobb who
through some ill-defined technology could enter people&#x27;s minds and
steal ideas. Cobb is given a proposition by a Japanese businessman
played by Ken Watanabe to implant an idea in the head of a rival
company&#x27;s heir, played by Cillian Murphy.<br /><br />Cobb is haunted by the death of his wife which serves as the central
conflict of the film. Inception suffers from a lack of development when
it comes to its characters. Ellen Page plays Ariadne an apprentice of
sorts who goes along with Cobb on what he hopes to be his final
assignment. Nolan&#x27;s script does not find time to explore Ariadne&#x27;s
character. Nor does it explore Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s character Arthur
who is Cobb&#x27;s close confident.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s highlights are mainly visual. Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s
floating scenes in the hotel hallway are a highlight in the film. Yet,
the visuals seem very scaled back. The trailer includes a clip of Paris
being turned on its head which we find out is part of Ellen Page&#x27;s
character&#x27;s training. If you are expecting magnificent visuals you will
be disappointed. Nolan&#x27;s dream sequences consist nothing more than an
empty city of identical apartment buildings, a hotel and a ski slope.<br /><br />At the Movies hosts Michael Philips and A.O. Scott summed up the
position best. The film lacked imagination. Nolan&#x27;s dream world lacks
something like Freudian symbolism found in Alfred Hitchcock or Luis
Bunuel films. Nolan creates a dream within a dream concept that just
seems contrived.<br /><br />But why recommend this film? There are enough good action sequences and
excellent performances to please the general audience who are most
often not interested in looking further than where Inception will take
them. In the end, the dream sequences are a ploy to fool you into
believing you have watched something more than an above average action
film.<br /><br />Tom Hardy&#x27;s character Eames tells Arthur in one scene that is
applicable to Nolan&#x27;s vision: &#x22;You mustn&#x27;t be afraid to dream a little
bigger, darling.&#x22; Perhaps Nolan&#x27;s subconscious may have been trying to
tell him something there! Verdict: 8/10
