Watching Inception, I actually felt as if I had lost my short term
memory faculty. I think various characters, especially little DiCaprio
and his sidekick Joeph Gordon-Levitt, were forever explaining things.
What had happened, what would happen, why somethings might happen and
why other things might not happen etc etc. But after a while it became
impossible to retain the nonsensical gobbledygook that was being
spouted and I kept asking myself why are they doing this, why are they
doing that? Why are they in the middle of a snow covered mountain? Why
is that guy floating around, tying everybody up and stuffing them down
a lift shaft? I think all this was explained. Was it? Oh I can&#x27;t
remember. But then a sense of complete ennui took over my body. A
listlessness so total that I could not summon up the energy to even try
to follow this nonsense.<br /><br />Today&#x27;s film makers often pay their respects to the great directors of
the past, but their praise and appreciation is entirely bogus. It
cannot be otherwise, considering they have no notion how to develop
plot, how to create characters that live and breathe and exude
vitality. For Christopher Nolan, wit drama and tension may be beyond
him, but surely simple coherence is not too much to ask? I am very
aware that many people love this film, indeed some even declare it a
work of genius (dear oh dear!), but there are some dissenting voices.
And for those who recognise Inception for the nullity it is, I have
more than once seen the story of &#x22;The King&#x27;s New Clothes&#x22; being invoked
to describe how so many people seem to have been taken in by this
nothing of a picture. But whilst I agree with most of the views of the
dissenters, I must take issue with those who use the &#x22;King&#x27;s New
Clothes&#x22; as a simile. And the reason is simple, this movie is not fit
to mentioned in the same breath, even via an unflattering comparison as
Hans Anderson&#x27;s marvellous story. Anderson created, in a few short
pages a storytelling masterpiece,; a strong narrative, compelling
characters and a classic denouement, all told with brevity wit and
clarity.And at the core of the story is an ethical and moral issue that
people can, and have debated for centuries And all these
characteristics in this gem of the storytellers art, are totally
missing in Nolan&#x27;s boring incoherent mess. In short, rather than be
compared to Anderson&#x27;s great little story, Nolan should be studying it
closely to see how a story can be successfully told.
