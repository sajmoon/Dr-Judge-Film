I don&#x27;t like to write too much about it. Other people have already
written enough, why it&#x27;s really bad. I think Christopher Nolan have
bought all this votes and higher rating. IMHO: Worst movie this year.
1)Mindless action film about the mind. 2)Rather primitive 3)Most
Overrated Movie of All time!! 4)Best part of the movie was when it
ended :) 5)Are you people watching the same film as me!!???? 6)Totally
simple story for an idiot dressed up with special effects and nothing
more etc. etc. etc. It is unbelievable that this film has received such
accolades by reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to
practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer&#x27;s mind
from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the
ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried
in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and
eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what
a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to
see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but
have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in
fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This
would be the dullest film I have ever seen!
