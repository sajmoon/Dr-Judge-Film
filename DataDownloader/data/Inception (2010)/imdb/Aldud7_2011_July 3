Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t watch it in theater because I wanted to watch it
in English. Before this I only waited so hard only fo HP. So the movie.
Without spoilers of cause. The plot. Yes the plot is... well it&#x27;s Nolan
so it&#x27;s obious that it&#x27;s awesome. Of cause It explores dreams and it&#x27;s
really interisting. The movie builds layers upon layers and it&#x27;s cool.
In Inception there is two twists - at the end and almost at the end. Of
cause there aren&#x27;t as many as in Prestige bus they really great. In the
end you&#x27;ll have to make a chose. But enough of that. Special effects.
Because the movie takes place in the dream they could do some cool
stuff. Really cool. And it truly deserved Oscar for that. Soundtrack is
amesing though I like TDK&#x27;s soundtrack just a bit better. Acting is as
awesome as in Dark Knight but is it better than the DK? I can&#x27;t say
it&#x27;s better cause the dark knight is like my favorite movie. It&#x27;s as
good as. So yeah that&#x27;s that. I have no idea why Nolan didn&#x27;t win an
Oscar. So watch it like right now.
