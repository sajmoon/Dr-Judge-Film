Greetings from Lithuania.<br /><br />Now that was something... I simply out off words, after watching this
one. This is going to sound very familiar, but this film was insanely
brilliant. This was probably the best experience i had in a movies -
ever.<br /><br />As much as &#x22;Avatar&#x22; was breathtaking experience in visuals, &#x22;Inception&#x22;
is a breathtaking experience in storytelling. Everything in this movie
works on the level of masterpiece - and i mean - everything! I didn&#x27;t
completely understood all aspects of the film in the first viewing (and
i don&#x27;t thing anyone did) - but this film blew my away.<br /><br />As much as i love &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, i think &#x22;Inception&#x22; is better
film. Watch this film, way you still can, because after 20 years, this
is going to the be classic like &#x22;2001&#x22; and &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; - it&#x27;s THAT
good.<br /><br />By the way, the zero-gravity scene in the hotel so reminded my of
&#x22;2001&#x22; - the music, cinematography, the feeling... the masterpiece.
