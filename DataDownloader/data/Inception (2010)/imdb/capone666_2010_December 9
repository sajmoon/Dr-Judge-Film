Inception<br /><br />Being a dream thief sounds kind of cool, so long as you&#x27;re not robbing
the wet ones. <br /><br />Fortunately, the REM raiders in this mind-boggling movie don&#x27;t embezzle
nocturnal emissions.<br /><br />Experts at extracting ideas from sleeping subjects, Cobb (Leonardo
DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are hired by a businessman
to implant an idea in the mind of his competitor&#x27;s son (Cillian
Murphy).<br /><br />To perform this act of &#x22;inception&#x22;, Cobb must expand his dream team to
include an architect (Ellen Page), a shifter (Tom Hardy), and a
sedative specialist (Dileep Rao).<br /><br />Once in the target&#x27;s mind, the team delves through layers of his
subconscious, only to be repeatedly sabotaged by the ghost of Cobb&#x27;s
deceased wife (Marion Cotillard).<br /><br />The most mold-breaking movie of the millennium, Inception is a smart,
stylish, thriller that will leave you resonating with queries.<br /><br />For example, why is someone telling you about their dream always so
boring? (Green Light)
