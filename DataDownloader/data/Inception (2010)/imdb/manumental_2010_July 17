After a June filled with movies that wanted to be nothing but popcorn
fun but ultimately your popcorn bucket emptied, we were all looking
forward to Inception bringing something intelligent to the screen. Man,
what a huge let down. I guess you can&#x27;t blame Inception for
expectations and for the crap that came before it but those factors may
have led to the disappointment. People labeling this film as smart are
doing nothing but exposing their own ignorance. Either that or else,
they&#x27;re exposing their own vast imagination because they must have
filled in scenes in their own head to compensate for this films obvious
shortcomings. There was no thought put into the dialogue and the
effects are certainly awful. The action scenes are weak simply because
they scream cartoon. I know they have the &#x22;Matrix excuse&#x22; that lets
them warp reality but the CG is too bizarre for my taste. The shocking
thing is that most of entire movie lacks real energy and especially
lacks heart. Anyone else think there was little chemistry between the
stars? Everyone besides Leo seemed to intentionally deliver no
personality or charisma. I knew Nolan was going for an Indy-bizarre
flavor. So, I expected little character development but I did expect to
care about something or someone in the film. That really never happens.
What a shame.<br /><br />Can filmgoers want to love a film so much that they block out how bad
the film turned out? Or, will they be jaded holding it up to impossible
expectations? Maybe my expectations were too high but I was greatly
disappointed by this movie. The writers of this film and YES, the
director took a promising concept and turned it in to a blathering
waste of effort. Hope can be a strong thing but hoping so hard that
you&#x27;ll love a film that you actually fool yourself in to believing its
good is genuinely unhealthy.
