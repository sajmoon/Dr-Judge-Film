Having decided I needed to see a film to relax, I saw Inception today.
I think it was a good choice because it totally relaxed me as I was
immersed in the story.<br /><br />The shorts for this got me in, and it seemed vaguely like a &#x22;Matrix&#x22;
type film (i.e. virtual reality) but also this is the second film I&#x27;ve
seen with Leonardo DiCaprio in it. The last one, Shutter Island was a
predictable but effective and moody film which I also enjoyed and
appreciated. Coincidentally DiCaprio&#x27;s character in each has issues
with his wife and children, and in both things are not quite what they
seem. Both are in their own ways very dark films.<br /><br />And yes, this is a film about the nature of reality, similar to the
inferior Vanilla Sky but closer to Total Recall. No doubt there are
enormous plot-holes in the film (I spotted a huge one myself) but if
you accept the series of premises that make the film possible, they are
internally consistent.<br /><br />I thought that there were several different ways that this could have
ended, and even waited through the credits to see if there was an extra
teaser at the end, but it&#x27;s not that sort of film.
