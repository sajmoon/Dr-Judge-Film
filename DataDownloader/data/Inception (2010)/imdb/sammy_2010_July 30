Inception is one movie which will force you to think beyond the
obvious. Taking Psychological analysis to a new level , Inception
drills deep into the deepest crevasses of Analytical though in
Philosophy. <br /><br />The movie puts forth a simple hypothesis and then tries to depict the
impossibility of it&#x27;s conception and of course &#x22;Inception&#x22;. <br /><br />The characterisation is superb. The character sketches are so finely
carved that one can&#x27;t help but identify their traits with one of our
own identities. <br /><br />The screenplay is amazing. Amazing because of the complex rhetoric the
writer had to deal with. Figuring out complete streams of thoughts for
every little idea for every individual requires some degree of
ingenuity which Nolan clearly showcases through his fluid writing
skills.<br /><br />Some critics have have tried to point out the frustrating aspects of
the movie in the form of self explanatory rhetoric in order to describe
what&#x27;s happening, some what similar to &#x22;Memento(2000)&#x22;; I beg to
differ. All Psychological thrillers have to indulge in some form or the
other of a plausible explanation to effectively and scientifically
explain the prognosis. <br /><br />The acting too was good.Each actor performed to his strengths, though I
would really like to see the back of all Dialogue delivery delivered by
sensuous actresses in low hushed up tones in a seductive manner. That
is downright typical and irritatingly similar. I men who speaks like
that?<br /><br />Ellen page does well in her role of an impressionable young lady
suddenly confronted with an idea she is intellectually capable of
perceiving but but not ready to digest instantaneously.<br /><br />Leonardo.....good great act. He really has come of the age, blends
beautifully with the script. In fact he saves the day whenever Marion
Cotillard overdoes the sensuous part.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy,Ken Watanabe,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Tom Hardy are simply
superb. I especially likes JGL and Tom Hardy&#x27;s stints.<br /><br />The Direction is great.....I am just getting tired of writing Good ,
great again and again. <br /><br />Catch it at all costs.
