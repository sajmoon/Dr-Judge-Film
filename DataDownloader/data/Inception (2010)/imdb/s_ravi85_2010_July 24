The only word I have for this movie is Amazing ! I always thought
Chirstopher Nolan was a intelligent director, but most of his movies
were either based on a novel or remakes. But Inception is one script
that ranks high up there . To be very honest, it took me a while to
understand the story until when Dicaprio explains it to Page, and since
then, I never wanted to miss any dialogue or any scene from the movie.<br /><br />I m not a big cine critic, but possibly if there was any story that was
so interesting other than &#x27;12 Angry Men&#x27; is surely INCEPTION. This
movie will turn out to be a classic in some time and sure to be a box
office success.<br /><br />Can people really think stories like these and in fact for a moment I
thought that this movie could really have been a disaster if people
weren&#x27;t able to understand the plot. But the way it was narrated, Boy
it was splendid.<br /><br />The action sequences were simply dashing and thought I wouldn&#x27;t
consider this to be Dicaprio&#x27;s best, I personally feel everyone acted
simply brilliantly and it was so difficult to find any flaws as a fan.<br /><br />I hope Nolan comes up with lot many interesting and intelligent movies
like this and we audience are always waiting to see this Master perform
what he is best at &#x27; Making classy movies&#x27;.<br /><br />Right from the start, till the end, the movie kept me interested all
along, and I was not surprised to see the name of the movie, title and
credits only after it ended. Right choice ! As a die hard fan of Nolan,
I wish him all the very best for all his movies, and people like him
take cinema to the next level.<br /><br />It took me a while to understand Matrix, as I had to watch it at least
few times to really understand the plot, but Inception mite belong to
that genre and is not like any other action movie as you need to
understand each and every dialogue closely. (Come on guys, let&#x27;s get
our imaginative side of the brain to work). Like they say in the movie,
our brain doesn&#x27;t function to its full potential.<br /><br />Great movie, interesting plot, crisp screenplay with lots of emotions
(unlikely Nolan may be), awesome cinematography and powerful
performances by its lead cast . I will watch it as many times as I can
as movies like this have to be celebrated big time. For me, its the
best action movie of 2010.<br /><br />My rating. 10/10
