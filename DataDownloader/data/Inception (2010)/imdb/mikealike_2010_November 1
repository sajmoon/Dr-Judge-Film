2010_November 1 
Call me &#x22;dumb&#x22;, I do not care, because I have my own mind and
experience and I know by now that I am not. My only reserve is that
maybe I should see it twice, or that this is not the moment for me to
have seen it( As is with reading books, today one can&#x27;t stand it ,
tomorrow it makes perfect sense). Apart from this, a movie being an
experience destined to consume itself at the maximum in one &#x22;kick&#x22;,
after this Inception experience, I feel that something is really
missing here. What is the idea of this movie? What is it trying to
express? In what system of beliefs is all this taking place? Because,
apart from the famous cast, the good performances, the special effects
that are everywhere and the incessant and disturbing gun noises, I do
not see what am I supposed to get enriched with through watching this
movie? OK, the idea of conscious dreaming is centuries-old, so is the
idea of &#x22;staging&#x22; the life or the universe(no need to mention the link
to Matrix, etc), but who would be the &#x22;dreamer&#x22; if we extrapolated to
our lives? Because the thought of a world meant just for corporations
and &#x22;important&#x22; individuals, I do not like. So, in a person&#x27;s life, any
person, how are the Inception ideas fitting in? Are we to look and see
who &#x22;dreams&#x22; for us, and the movie couldn&#x27;t put this idea bluntly? Are
we dealing with an explanation for wave function collapse, controlled
consciously by some skilled to do so and implementing during our sleep?
I feel the need to say, &#x22;please explain yourself&#x22;. One cannot mount
such a giant of a movie (publicity, effects, cast and so), and in the
end leave you with a bigger blur than before such ideas occurred. I
would say it is either a case of snobbish commercialism that is not
backed up by enough understanding and research, or a case of intricate
mind and ideas that have no clarity in expressing themselves. It is an
exercise for the brain, I give it that. But in the light of too much
gratuitous violence, too less contoured universe of the movie, too
crowded action, too soapy emotional effects (the passed away wife, the
uncommunicative rich father) and too high praise that it deserves
(c&#x27;mon, this is the new Matrix? Are we going back as the time goes by?,
I feel deeply not pleased.
