Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie,
however its not done as creatively as something like &#x22;eternal sunshine
of a spotless mind&#x22;. Looking past that there was good potential for
character development, but really the only character who even feels
remotely developed is the main one. <br /><br />I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained
all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just
squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And
Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found
legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion. <br /><br />In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife
was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with
just a melodramatic conversation in the end. <br /><br />On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all
movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time
passes,their real value diminishes.<br /><br />This movie deserves a 6-7 but i gave it a 1 for the sake of balance. Oh
and another thing to notice, go check the voters who voted it high, 9.5
average rating comes from kids...
