The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Inception is a thought-provoking action
movie that is best tagged with keywords like &#x22;con-men,&#x22; &#x22;corporate
espionage,&#x22; &#x22;psychological thriller&#x22; or even &#x22;philosophy.&#x22;<br /><br />The-Not-Too-Revealing-Review: Inception takes a very simple - and very
traditional - genre and fashions it around a complicated idea. The
movie is truly a work of art - in a positive sense as much as in a
pejorative sense. Director Christopher Nolan takes a fairly complicated
notion and unravels it for the audience in such a way as to entertain
visually and provoke thoughtfully. The movie was, however, art for
art&#x27;s sake. It was a demonstration: the goal was not to amaze, thrill,
or surprise but to bewilder. It was a presentation of a mental knot and
then the step-by-step exhibition of how one would disentangle it. In
this regard the movie was a success. Some of my many grievances (and
they were many) against the film: The action scenes were quite
obviously padding for the core of the film. Most of the scenes were
shot in indoor, extremely confined situations - and though stylish -
they were not the strikingly visual scenes I had hoped for. The big,
outdoor, scenes where this big budget film had a chance to truly
impress failed completely. The fight scenes where the movie had the
opportunity to provide some iconic segment - looked like men hoisted in
the air with wires. Between two of Nolan&#x27;s other works - Memento and
the Dark Knight - Inception was more Memento. The attention to detail
present in the Dark Knight made it into Inception - but only into the
unraveling of Nolan&#x27;s idea. The many filler scenes lacked this
consideration and left the film with a duality of wonderfully
thought-through details interspersed with inanity.<br /><br />Some other odds and ends: Tip of the hat to Nolan for leaving some
things unexplained. It is unclear if this is truly present day or some
time in the future and the director rightly leaves that for the
audience to decide for themselves. Explanations for the mechanisms of
the technology are left alone - and for the better. I could not have
told you who Tom Hardy was before this film but after this performance
I look forward to whatever it is he may do next. I hope Nolan credits a
certain 1999 film (whose title I shall not mention so I do not spoil
this movie for anyone else). The relationship goes far beyond
similarity or inspiration. Nolan took it further (with a budget of over
$130 million more) but it is bothersome to see Inception heralded for
&#x22;originality.&#x22; Overall I cannot recommend this film. It was neither
enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. I can respect the skill it takes
for someone to make a house of cards but in the end I have no real
desire to stare at a house of cards.
