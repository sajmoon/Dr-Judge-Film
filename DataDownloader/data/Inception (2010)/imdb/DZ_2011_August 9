Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point.
Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the
story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don&#x27;t make a movie great as just
complicatedness doesn&#x27;t make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I
have understood that Nolan is not &#x22;my director&#x22;. The Dark Knight was
also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a
summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for
Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart
and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the
atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream?
Well, I don&#x27;t think so. It causes what then? I didn&#x27;t much care about
the intrigue, couldn&#x27;t identify with the characters, so the most
important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is
the &#x22;dreams&#x22; itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David
Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes
meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream
sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians
and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It
is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality.
Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, &#x22;the street bending&#x22; scene
is my favorite, it doesn&#x27;t help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn&#x27;t
understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or
impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more
impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh
reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except
for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my
opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be
many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the
&#x22;snow&#x22; sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or
excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact
that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio&#x27;s
performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so
far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What&#x27;s eating
Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses
the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine&#x27;s character might
be a reference (tribute) for his character in Children of Men. If you
ask me, the best part of the movie is the &#x22;train scene&#x22; It was the only
scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The &#x22;gravity&#x22;
sequence was just interesting. I didn&#x27;t find it epic. Finally, about
the plot, I didn&#x27;t find the starting point creative, brilliant or
exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception,
weren&#x27;t there better options? In other words, the main story was too
poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan&#x27;s style, to tell a
story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However,
if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr.
Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.
