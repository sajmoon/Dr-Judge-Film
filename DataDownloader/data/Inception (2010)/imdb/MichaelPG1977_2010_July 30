It has only two faults: 1) Although Ken Watanabe is a good actor and
delivered a great performance, I couldn&#x27;t understand what he was saying
half the time. 2) the obsessive focus on the top-- there were maybe 20
shots/insert shots of the top- whether it was spinning or motionless.
We needed maybe 5.<br /><br />Otherwise, it&#x27;s the kind of movie that I wanted to make when I moved to
L.A. three years ago -- a stunningly brilliant psychological thriller.<br /><br />John Lennon said that he couldn&#x27;t listen to the radio sometimes because
when he listened to a great song he was driven mad with envy because he
wished he wrote it. I am not comparing myself to Lennon in a movie
sense, but as a small-time filmmaker, I understood that feeling when I
watched &#x22;Inception.&#x22; I doubt that I will watch anything that comes
close to matching its greatness during the next 5 years, and I am
astounded and pleased that the public received it so well. I thought
that the masses were permanently stuck on wanting something as juvenile
and basic as Avatar.
