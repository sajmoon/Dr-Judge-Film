With all the big budgets and technology Hollywood can get, what did we
the audience get? Many sequels (And I dislike Dark Knight, being just a
little better sequel).<br /><br />Since the Matrix was released more than 10 years ago, what did we the
Sci-Fi film fans get compared with a decade or two before that? Chris
Nolan delivered on these two accounts, and fewer and fewer directors in
Hollywood can really master in commanding a complicated project and a
good story telling, at the same time. I want more films like
&#x22;Inception&#x22; coming to theaters here, which spent a lot of money making
one as well as taking us to experience something other media, such as
TV, games, can&#x27;t offer. That is what we trade for paying the ticket to
get in a theater.<br /><br />There is also a philosophical angle for the audience, I think. When we
moviegoers are used to be overpowered by technology hard to distinguish
among themselves, like computer graphics, animation, special effects,
..., unavoidably we find ourselves attracted to those with a &#x22;FORM&#x22;
standing out among all, on top of such as acting of any particular
roles, words of power of any particular scenes. &#x22;FORM&#x22; of this film
will be something many to follow. If the derivatives of &#x22;FORM&#x22; to this
film lead to a new spectrum for film makings, then that will be
something interesting for us movie lovers to know first.<br /><br />The only thing I don&#x27;t get it though - why did Saito and Fischer not
recognize each other when they both waked up in the airplane? Aren&#x27;t
they supposed to know each other, being major competitors in the
business they are respectively in?
