2010_July 20 
No-one, but no-one has achieved the feel of the dream state like David
Lynch. On a fraction of the budget of this film,and zero CGI, he
succeeds in being way more unsettling and detached from reality than
any other director, and captures the vocabulary of dreaming
authentically. Nolan is NOT a genius: The Dark Night was merely OK, and
he dragged Gotham City into the gutter of a run - down Detroit, not the
fantastical Gothic structures it should be. Memento was more
interesting, though.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer I thought: &#x22;Oh God, not Leo again. &#x22; Or is it
Neo? And the collapsing and spontaneously forming cityscapes are
straight out of Dark City. Dark City was a Noir/Sci- Fi hybrid, too,
made a long time before this. Doesn&#x27;t have the awe-factor of,say 2001,
or even Blade Runner.<br /><br />Not original, not brilliant, not lasting.<br /><br />It&#x27;s true, what another reviewer said. This film is definitely
age-indexed. The younger you are, the more impressed you&#x27;ll be. The
older you are, you might nod off, perchance to dream....
