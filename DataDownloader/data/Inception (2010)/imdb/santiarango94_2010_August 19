I admit Inception is a very good film. It really explores very deep on
dreams and its behavior, i liked very much the sentimental dilemma the
movie goes through and the action sequences are believable according to
the plot.<br /><br />Even though there is many aspects to highlight on this picture i find
it hard that inception is that high on IMDb&#x27;s top. I think that it&#x27;s
exaggerated rating makes the future viewers too much anxious about the
film that they won&#x27;t get THAT MUCH as to think its is their favourite.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong cause i am not claiming Inception is a bad movie
cause I&#x27;m not. I just think it deserves a lower rating on the top 250.
That will help people feel much more good after they watch the film.
