I know that my review will be lost between the hundreds and hundreds,
but i couldn&#x27;t stop myself from writing this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i
enjoyed this movie from start to end, and there were some things that i
didn&#x27;t quite understand, some were about the plot, but most of them
were about the movie itself. I mean that i have a different perception
to what dreams are and watched parts of the film with just a little bit
of anxiety (something i had never felt), wishing for something else to
happen. But i&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />First of all let me say that i made a mistake when i decided to watch
this movie with some of my friends. Apparently, they didn&#x27;t take it as
seriously as i did, because i kept hearing some giggles here and there,
they would find things that they considered highly funny and go off
about it, and they weren&#x27;t the only ones there, some other people were
doing the same. I didn&#x27;t care to shut them up because i didn&#x27;t want to
distract myself, not even for one second. This is a movie you have to
watch with lots of attention, because there are parts where so much
information is shared or so much things are revealed, that you might
miss some. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s recommended that you pay attention to it
and, if you need it, watch it again.<br /><br />One of the points that made me like this movie so much was its
tremendous cast. Everybody played their part perfectly, flawless. I
have to admit that i&#x27;m not a big fan of Leonardo, i&#x27;ve never really
felt him in any movie, but i have got to say that i respect his work,
and after watching this movie, i&#x27;m sure he will be remembered as one of
the best. Not just for this film, but for the rest of them.<br /><br />The plot is original, fresh, well in other words, Nolan at his best. He
has achieved the kind of story that i&#x27;m attracted to: a story with so
much to see, so much to experience, so much to feel, that it&#x27;s actually
hard to understand. And at the end, it left me thinking about it over
and over. But i just expected a bit more about the dreams. At least for
me, they weren&#x27;t dreams exactly, they were just an approach. I won&#x27;t go
deep into this because i don&#x27;t want to spoil anything, i&#x27;ll just say
that i needed just a bit more.<br /><br />This is a movie to be remembered, i think it&#x27;s to high on the top 250,
but still, it really deserves to be there. You won&#x27;t regret watching
this film, it is wonderful. And, by the way, i&#x27;ve only watched it once,
so all the little questions that i had by the end of the movie will be
solved (i hope so) when i see it for the second time. And i expect some
Oscars for this movie. Enjoy!
