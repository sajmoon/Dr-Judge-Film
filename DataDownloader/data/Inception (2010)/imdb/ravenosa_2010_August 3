I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take
away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who&#x27;s job it is to
endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and
unaffecting action you see on the screen.<br /><br />If you think one level of action clich&#xE9;s is enough to rot your brain to
a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clich&#xE9;s, all
explained for you in a &#x22;hey this isn&#x27;t very interesting but we&#x27;ve
created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the
gunfights in a dreamworld&#x22;.<br /><br />I&#x27;d probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences
I&#x27;ve ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120
minutes (I left early) back.
