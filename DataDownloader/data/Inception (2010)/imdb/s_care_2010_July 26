Yes, he does it again! Ever since DiCaprio began shedding his lover-boy
image, he has made some priceless contributions to the world of cinema.
Two powerful performances in the same year is known as a work very well
done. Throughout the movie, he maintains his predominance as the
protagonist without being dwarfed by th...e intriguing storyline or the
mighty special effects. Within the initial couple of minutes, he
connects with the audience and takes them along on his journey through
the next two hours or so. As for others, Joseph Gordon has done his
best and Tom Hardy exceeded expectations.<br /><br />Partly, this all comes from Nolan&#x27;s own construct of the movie. Quantum
Mechanics (a branch of physics) is where the science and religion
intersect. This is, where the difference between the real &#x26; virtual
dissolves and life in itself becomes a layered dream. Nolan&#x27;s work
drinks deeply from these accepted postulates of physics, path-breaking
artistry (Esher&#x27;s lithographs), and the tenets of the modern
neuroscience (psychological implications of the loose ends and
hypnosis), putting him miles ahead in the league of the lead sci-fi
filmmakers. He has put together a compelling job of simplifying these
concepts for an average movie-goer, while fantastically tweaking it in
his own unique style, &#x27;Your mind is the scene of crime.&#x27; He hasn&#x27;t
deprived his film of some very convincing action, either. In a way you
can take this flick as &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; built on the emotional foundation
of &#x27;Memento.&#x27; It can do to Nolan, what &#x27;Avatar&#x27; did to Cameroon at the
Oscars, except that it may fair much better. Leo, in his turn, may
loose out to the likes of Colin Firth in &#x27;Single Man&#x27; or better, be
cannibalized by his own performance in &#x27;Shutter Island.&#x27; Nevertheless,
he has achieved his target already.<br /><br />Since the promos first hit the screens last year, the expectations ran
high from a filmmaker, who gave us from psychological heavyweights,
like &#x27;Memento&#x27; to the adrenalin-pumping &#x27;The Dark Knight,&#x27; finally
culminating into the masterwork, called &#x27;Inception&#x27;!
