I will warn you that my thoughts on this film are incomplete because I
have only had a chance to see it once thus far. This movie demands
multiple viewings and without that experience I don&#x27;t feel equipped to
write an accurate review, but I will do my best. <br /><br />Inception is a masterwork of creative cinema, and a tour de force of
director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s mastery of the craft of creating films
that engage the audience on every level. If this film has a flaw, it&#x27;s
that it&#x27;s too intelligent, too inventive, and too different for your
average moviegoer to be able to fully appreciate. <br /><br />As a pure film experience, I don&#x27;t feel that Inception is as finely
tuned or well polished as The Dark Knight. However, the concept that is
being presented and the sheer imagination that Nolan has created and
shared with the audience is something truly special that defies
explanation. This is almost without question the single most
imaginative and inventive film of the 21st Century thus far, and among
the top most creative of all time. Chris Nolan is truly the most gifted
filmmaker of our time. I&#x27;m afraid this will simply be too new for the
Academy to appreciate, but Nolan absolutely deserves every Oscar they
can nominate him for. <br /><br />I knew this film would be a great movie, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for just
how much this would exceed anything that has come before. I know, I&#x27;m
going around in circles and saying the same thing, but this film cannot
be explained and must be experienced. I would be doing you a disservice
to try and put it into text. Simply put, go see this movie, as soon as
you can, as many times as you can, and be prepared to change the way
you think about what a film can be. <br /><br />Rating: A+
