Inception is a much hyped film that has won a lot of praise.
Unfortunately, whilst I believe Inception to be a slick, well-made
movie it has one major drawback. The entire time I watched it, I never
once neared the edge of my seat. <br /><br />Technically, this film is superb but I&#x27;ve become of the mind that top
notch special effects and well crafted fight choreography are all but a
given nowadays.<br /><br />For example, why are Pixar films better than Dreamwork&#x27;s CGI films?
Both studios consistently demonstrate superb technical expertise but
the likes of Toy Story 3, Wall-E and Up trump Madgascar, Kung Fu Panda
and Over The Hedge because they have heart. The stories are masterfully
told and you really care for the characters.<br /><br />Emotively, what does Inception amount to? Apart from the underlying
substory of Cobb and his wife, the film never offers anything to make
you feel or care for the characters. It&#x27;s one slick set-piece after
another.<br /><br />I honestly rate Christoper Nolan as far and away the best director of
his generation and have very few bad words to say about any of his
previous works. With his two Batman films, he accomplished a rare and
superbly entertaining balance between heart, brain and brawn. With
Inception, he just fails to rediscover this difficult balance.<br /><br />The concept of entering dreams and extracting/incepting ideas is very
innovative and throws up a few interesting philosophical/ethical/etc
conundrums along with a lot of possibilities for action and story.<br /><br />But, by a perverse twist, this pioneering idea actually hinders more
than helps Inception. There&#x27;s so much time spent trying to explain the
convoluted nature of &#x27;extracting/incepting&#x27; that there&#x27;s little room
for anything else.<br /><br />The overall plot doesn&#x27;t help. Yes, maybe it would have been hackneyed
to have Cobb&#x27;s band of mind-thieves trying to save the world/dying
President/etc but it would have been an improvement. Cobb excluded,
they were simply in it for the money because who would care if one
greedy business tycoon bested another? I know I didn&#x27;t. <br /><br />I also think the danger of limbo would have been more frightening and
thus made the film more exciting if it was eternal and inescapable-
i.e. hell. <br /><br />Inception was also possibly the slowest movie to get going ever
(perhaps excluding 2001!!)- particularly when you compare it to Nolan&#x27;s
other films. Yes, I appreciate that there was a lot of ground work to
do to set up the main story but this seemed to take an age and didn&#x27;t
entertain in doing so. <br /><br />I can&#x27;t fault any of the actors in this film- in particular, Hardy and
Levitt whose antagonistic relationship is such a joy that I felt it
deserved a lot more exploration/screen time. <br /><br />I think Inception gets caught between two minds. On one hand, it has a
real goldmine of ethical, philosophical and emotive ideas at the core
of its &#x27;dreamworld&#x27; concept- namely the conflict between the real
world/dream world and how the blurring of this line can be very
dangerous to a person&#x27;s mental health.<br /><br />On the other hand, the &#x27;invading the mind&#x27; concept gives it free reign
to pull a &#x27;Matrix&#x27; and have gravity changing, weird staircases, abrupt
shifts of scenery and so on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nolan fails slightly in his bid to find a compromise
between these two approaches. The end result is a very technically
accomplished film that fails to display the sort of deep and emotive
substance that it&#x27;s bold concept and star-studded cast of real actors
(no talentless pretty faces here) promised. 7/10
