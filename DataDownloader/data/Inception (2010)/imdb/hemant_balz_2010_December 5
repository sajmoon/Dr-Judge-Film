Inception,let us take a leap of faith.Well,People have already taken a
leap of faith in Christopher Nolan since the beginning of his era
stretching from Memento to The Dark Knight.But this is different.You
delve into dreams and then hang on between worlds of realism or just a
dream.Christopher Nolan has the absolute best ideas of all the movie
writers.Apart from his directing,which is exemplary,the writing script
stands out.Just the concept and to make us believe it is possible is
just truly remarkable.The casting starting from Leonardo was
brilliant.His acts are always regarded as superb.And Mr Cobb in
Inception is at the top for me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt &#x26; Ellen Page are
great too.Ken Watanabe is a fabulous man to have in your movie as he
justifies each and every role given to him.He is a great actor.So is
Cillian Murphy for his role.Just so calm and compose in this act where
as his previous movie roles were being aggressive and cunning.He is a
diversified actor.I don&#x27;t want to forget Marion Cotillard after her
role of Mal and just to have Tom Berenger in the movie is an honor.The
movie draws attention on basic idea extraction from dreams.A vision
appears to the audiences as Cobb &#x26; crew delve into numerous dreams.When
we see gravity shifts and Limbo drops audiences will always get a kick
of their own that Christopher Nolan is brilliant.Camera-work is
sensational,Directing is again superb,Screenplay is everlasting.And
music by Hans Zimmer is as perfect as a Dream Creation itself.The
conclusion for this movie stands out as one of the rarest &#x26; visionary
movies to have come along.Justifies its #4th position in the top
250.This is not great,this is just grand.Vision is for the
Oscars,Dreams are for the audiences and Nolan is just Nolan.Simply
Brilliant.People might think now,after such successes of movies from
Nolan.Can&#x27;t we call Perfect as the new adjective,that we know now,none
other than Nolan.
