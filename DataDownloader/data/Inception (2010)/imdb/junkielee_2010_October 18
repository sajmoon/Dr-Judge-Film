2010_October 18 
This is the first film I saw in cinema in Shanghai after a six-month
intermission (feels great back home). INCEPTION is no doubt an
excellent choice after having already gained over 400 millions Chinese
dollars (roughly 60 millions $) from Chinese box office, which is a
magnificent feat as I know usually Chinese domestic box office
blockbusters never dare to challenge audience&#x27;s intelligence.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has made it, INCEPTION at least parallels with THE
DARK KNIGHT if not surpasses it! I give both film 9 out of 10 but with
a slight preference of INCEPTION, I could not give a 10/10 as I&#x27;m a
sheer perfectionist.<br /><br />Clearly this film is worth more than watching once, the conceptual
comprehension still traps me, one great contribution is that the film
knows exactly how to keep audience within the scale of tolerance of the
intrinsic complexity and magnifies its necessity of re-watching, which
is a quality so rare and precious to attain now.<br /><br />The scientific explanation which now we can find online everywhere,
which is truly stunning! The script is nearly seamless sealed with
plausible and logical connections. The visual effects create an
eye-dropping feast of this era without throwing itself into recently
ubiquitous 3D tricks.<br /><br />The acting is both impressive (from Leonardo and Marion) and
entertaining (from Ellen, Tom and Joseph), the former is Oscar-baiting
while the latter literally under-developed, love the little kiss banter
between Joseph and Ellen. Another discovery is Tom Hardy, a promising
rising star in Hollywood now (Sam Washington may feel threatened). <br /><br />INCEPTION is a film with an admirable conception beforehand ground on
man&#x27;s incessant pursuit of dreams, it has invented an appealing game
which is unprecedented and designed in a flawless way to keep audience
stick to their seats plus a lingering aftertaste. <br /><br />If I have to pick some bones out of this egg, I have to say the
perfectness of the game itself is pessimistic which makes present life
more meaningless and tasteless.
