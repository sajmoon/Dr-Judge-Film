It is very rarely that I would feel strongly enough to write a movie
review but after I saw inception I felt so captivated by the movie that
I decided to write one.<br /><br />In this film Nolan has delivered a truly spectacular film which deals
with the concept of dreams and the possibility that our dreams could
somehow be invaded and secrets could be extracted from them. The film
is centered on the possibility of instead of something being extracted
from a dream could an idea be planted in our dream to change our
perception on an aspect of our life.<br /><br />It is through this brief story outline that Nolan delivers a multi
layered masterpiece which sees a group of extractors led by Leonardo Di
Caprio try to plant an idea into a dream which leads to some of the
most surreal environments seen in a film since the Matrix. Even Nolan&#x27;s
excellent use of architecture serves to immerse viewers further into
this dreamworld.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s casting once again is flawless in this film just like it was in
the Batman films and Memento. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a very strong
and emotional performance as a man who is struggling with his past and
there are also stellar performances from Joseph Gordan Levitt, Ellen
Page and Tom Hardy.<br /><br />I will admit that this film is for the thinkers among us as it requires
a lot of concentration throughout the film to keep up with the films
layered storyline and I am sure there will be more than a few people
who will not get it. However those of us that like films that push our
imagination to the next level will definitely not be disappointed.<br /><br />This is Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece and I hope that it gets the iconic
recognition it deserves.
