I watched the movie at the premieres last year and forgot to write a
review. It might be because of the way this movie completely BLEW MY
MIND AWAY :S<br /><br />Christopher Nolan outDID himself. WHAT a movie. What a movie. That&#x27;s
what we ALL were ranting as we made our way out of the theatre hall. I
can&#x27;t say much. So it&#x27;s about dreams, of course. A dream within a dream
within a dream. Great performances by the actors, absolutely
outstanding cinematography, genius direction and WHAT a screenplay.
What twists, what turns, what shocks, what games.<br /><br />Anyway, to those who STILL haven&#x27;t watched Inception, you&#x27;re missing
out on LIFE. This was a downright roller-coaster ride that had me on
the edge of my seat and among existence, it was just the large screen
and me. Just the two of us, since I momentarily lost track of all that
was going on around me. Beautiful, outstanding, literally mind blowing
and an epic on its own. I&#x27;ll just rate you.<br /><br />10 on 10 and more.
