Visually stunning but with a little bit on the inside this movie will
give you exactly the same experience as The Shutter Island - previous
DiCaprio&#x27;s work. <br /><br />Tom Hardy &#x26; Cillian Murphy are the only actors who actually fit the
movie. The rest of quite amazing line-up is all over the place and
doesn&#x27;t really suit their roles. Movie seems to focus on DiCaprio
without even trying to give away any information about other
characters. <br /><br />Now to the art work: the dreams that were created suppose to be
convincing to the subject but they didn&#x27;t even look that real on the
screen. Artificial acting with backgrounds looks really plastic and
gives away the ending right in middle of the movie. <br /><br />I would consider 2 hour 30 minutes is a big fail from editors and
director for the amount you get from the flick. Christopher Nolan spent
almost 10 years writing the screen play, but originality that he had in
Memento is well overpowered by Hollywood glitter with no substance that
new Batman movies are so full of. <br /><br />Overall, watch it if you like eye-candy movies. I bet there would be
plenty fans and a lot of talk but movie just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me when
you know what is going to happen and there is more than an hour to go
until the end.
