This movie lives up to the hype! Just when you think that you won&#x27;t be
able to see a movie that will be so original and blow your mind away.
Watch Inception and think again....<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is proving that he is one of the best Directors(if
not the best) of this era. I&#x27;m not really a Chris Nolan fan, but I have
to give credit where credit is due! He did an amazing job! This is by
far the best movie has he made and that&#x27;s saying a lot since he
directed films such as &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;.
Not only does he bring exceptional Special effects and sound effects.
He keeps to his roots by putting a lot of focus on the
characterization, dialogue, and acting!<br /><br />This is where Leonardo DiCaprio and company come in! They all
contributed with STRONG performances to make this movie what
Christopher Nolan intended it to be. A Master Piece! <br /><br />There are only a few movies that come around every few years that you
can say is an instance classic as soon as the credits role. The kind of
movie that you tell your friends, family, and coworkers to watch so you
can compare solutions, ideas of the film. This is one of those movies! <br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie isn&#x27;t for everyone, if you want to watch a
movie that&#x27;s dull and ordinary and easy to figure out, then this movie
is not for you! This movie requires full attention and missing a scene
to go use the bathroom can cost you vital information that you will
need to come up with your own conclusions at the end of the film! You
have been warned! <br /><br />Take the advise of the thousands of people voting/posting great reviews
and do yourself a favor and go see the movie for yourself! You be the
Judge! Out Here.
