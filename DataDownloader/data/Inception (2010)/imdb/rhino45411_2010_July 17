Inception is a summer blockbuster that actually makes the viewers
think! Finally a director and crew realize you can make a film full of
explosions and awesome slow motion effects with an actual complex
story! This is not your Michael Bay summer blockbuster...<br /><br />It is very refreshing to see that even though Nolan has rebooted the
Batman franchise, he isn&#x27;t losing sight of his own original ideas.
Jonathan Nolan (Writer) obviously deserves a lot of credit for making a
believable script that isn&#x27;t campy and full of one liners throughout
(Even though there are a few, but it is necessary to keep the balance
of film from being one sided).<br /><br />The film is a modern classic that should not be missed. Whether you
like Nolan or not there has to be credit given to the cast who made
this insane thrill ride feel absolutely real throughout.<br /><br />Academy Awards are looking promising...
