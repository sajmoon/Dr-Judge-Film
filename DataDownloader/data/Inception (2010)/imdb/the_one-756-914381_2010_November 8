I am amazed how many people ranked this one as a top choice.<br /><br />Interesting story, but the movie doesn&#x27;t serve it.<br /><br />It lacks coherence, like for example either the writer or Nolan had
some extended vacation during the writing/filming.<br /><br />Consider the entire snowy mountain sequence - 20-25 minutes long, and
you never know what happens there. OK, there&#x27;s an avalanche, but where
is that, and where are the characters in relation to it? No, just an
avalanche (even poorly made, like taken from a Discovery documentary or
such). Also there&#x27;s a lot of shooting out there, but you never know
who&#x27;s shooting at who (where are they in relation which each other).<br /><br />Also, the former wife is possibly the worst boogie(wo)man ever, and
drops the movie down by her own.<br /><br />Di Caprio seemed to have had a vacation of his own. He seems rather
absent, having a hard time trying to adjust to what happens. Perhaps
the former wife had the most of him...<br /><br />On the other hand, you&#x27;ll VERY MUCH like every sequence with Joseph
Gordon-Levitt in it. Yes, even when he talks. I would suggest he should
had been lead on this one, but I&#x27;m afraid the former wife would have
had the most of him too...<br /><br />Superb music, and probably the only movie where music won&#x27;t stop to
change tune according to the movie scene, meaning the composer
succeeded in finding tunes that fit whatever happens on the screen,
even when the location, or the events as such, change, and that tune
thusly can go as far as 8 minutes (sometimes a beautiful crescendo).<br /><br />When present, superb SFX, but they are rather rare.<br /><br />Even the ending is bad - by a long shot. Should had been the best, jaw-
dropping, part of the movie, instead it&#x27;s the worst (OK, except the
snowy mountains sequence).
