I went to watch this movie with very high expectations indeed (since I
have watched every other Nolan movie and considers him my most favorite
director/writer) and frankly this movie exceeded all my expectations.
The plot is indeed brilliant and only a mastermind like Nolan can write
such a story. He never fails to mesmerize us with the creativity of his
ideas, whether it is Memento, The Prestige or The Dark knight. But even
as great as those movies are, Inception is probably Nolan&#x27;s best work
to date.<br /><br />The idea of inception is brilliant but extremely complex and it needs a
lot of factors to pull it off. Great direction is one, strong character
performances is the other and obviously since we are talking about
dream world, visual effects have to be stunning. Thankfully the movie
delivers in all these aspects. The performances by Leo, Page, Levitt,
Hardy, Ken and Micheal Caine (though his appearance in the movie is
brief) are fantastic. The visual effects are the best of their kind,
the lobby fight scene involving Levitt is something never heard of
before. The locations chosen by Nolan are fantastic (I was reading
somewhere they went to like 6 different countries to shoot this movie
and in all kinds of extreme weathers). All these ingredients make it
one hell of a movie. I am rooting for Nolan to get multiple Oscars this
time :)
