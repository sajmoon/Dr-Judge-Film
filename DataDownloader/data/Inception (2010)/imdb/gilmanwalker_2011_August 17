It went too big. Personally there was just something wrong with Nolan&#x27;s
interpretation of the whole dream thing. I got uber bored and i thought
most of the stuff was too predictable. People were freaking out saying
this was the best film ever and it was mind-blowing and all that jazz.
i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT
HALFWAY THROUGH. It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made
out to be. 1. It wasn&#x27;t as good as it was supposed to be. 2. I didn&#x27;t
end up liking any of the characters that much. 3. Nolan&#x27;s fan-boys get
on my nerves. 4. I have a friend who obnoxiously is obsessed with
Nolan, and that makes me biased. 5. I had higher expectations based on
Nolan&#x27;s previous films.
