.. few Priyadarshani movies are yet to be released in this year, but I
bet you won&#x27;t find any of them funnier than this creation of
Christopher Nolan. We were laughing like anything when we came out of
hall after watching &#x22;Thriller&#x22; INCEPTION.<br /><br />What I don&#x27;t understand is this! Why Hollywood movies has yet to come
out of excessive and unnecessary use the computerization of actions and
scenes. I just don&#x27;t know why they unnecessarily put a loud music
behind every scene which is done by one of those sentimental heroes and
made the whole action modified by the computerization, it just makes it
unbearable. I would rather keep the whole thing flow naturally and
something people can relate to.<br /><br />so here is a plot. wait a minute... was there anything like plot?
probably there was. I wasn&#x27;t really feeling this one...<br /><br />This is a Hollywood production trying to make an action packed thriller
like they make in Bollywood! Nothing wrong with that! I strongly
recommend that everyone should see last 15 minutes of this movie (if
you manage to survive till that point). <br /><br />Sure,it looks cool but also ridiculous at the same time! And it&#x27;s like
the director couldn&#x27;t decide to make a thriller with action or an
action movie full of suspense! On both fronts he fails! The plot is
completely uninteresting! <br /><br />The twists and turns can be predicted from early on and the movie keeps
dragging on into boredom! The movie does have some solid moments of
suspense and drama! But simply not enough to reach the level of &#x22;24&#x22;
(where this movie obvious is influenced by)! Too bad that the end
result is like this! With more attention to logic and plot this movie
could have been great! Well, there are few saving graces for movie.
Dialogues and ad libbing are treat to hear. Marion Cotillard proves
that he is definitely one of the front-line actors and Michael Caine
Jr. proves himself again after Bewitched. and yes, how can I forget
Tai-Li Lee and her stunts (a la Paprika) and one must not forget the
guy, whosoever it is,who made the trailer and posters and made people
believe that this is movie worth watching, so go and watch in theaters,
or just rewatch &#x22;Paprika&#x22;.
