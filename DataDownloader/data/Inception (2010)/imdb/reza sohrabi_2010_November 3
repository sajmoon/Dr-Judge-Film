In my opinion it&#x27;s the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen and has been
made;others can say whatever they desire.Be aware that the ones who
think that for example:&#x22;Last Tango in Paris&#x22; is the best movie
ever-which in fact is a total crap- should hate this movie, because
it&#x27;s not one of their taste. As usual IMDb top 1000 voters have given
this movie the lowest grades merely for their prestige,maybe they think
they know better which movie is perfect which is not. Aged viewers of
IMDb couldn&#x27;t grasp the whole plot easily, so they underrated it as
well. Inception should be the top in 250,why? because Godfathers were
for old times-although they&#x27;re interesting same as &#x22;The Shawshank
Redemption&#x22;-but they&#x27;re not as fascinating as Inception. Let me tell it
this way;observe what the future generation would say about
&#x22;Christopher Nolan&#x22;, and see his legend that becomes myth, so be proud
that you are living in the same time he lives. ****Nolan we love
you****.
