Inception is the most powerful work of art created in our time. Nolan
is a worthy successor to Freud. It would take a lifetime to describe in
words, the heights that it reaches and the depths that it achieves.
Cinema is no longer limited by the size of the screen. Inception is
augmented reality. 3D without them glasses, Finally!<br /><br />I have never seen a movie like Inception and trust me, neither have
you. Memento was only a teaser. Nolan is a master of the mind.
Inception is a hypnosis, that creates mind orgasms.<br /><br />I happened to be one of the lucky few to catch a late night preview
showing. And boy did I have to struggle for that invite. But things
fell into place, and I got in, only to realize that this film isn&#x27;t
about you getting into the theater, to watch it, Inception gets into
you. <br /><br />Your mind is really the scene of crime.
