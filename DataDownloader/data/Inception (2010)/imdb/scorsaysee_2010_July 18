It all started with a single idea from one man and that with the name
of Nolan, Christopher Nolan that is. He loves to play around the human
psyche and able to convene hordes of science-fiction audience that
cannot help but to play with him in return. Far from the specs of The
Dark Knight, but without further ado make way for a new mind bending
activity called Inception.<br /><br />A film that is intelligently and exuberantly plotted, directed, acted
and delivered by the cast, crew and again by the clever as ever writer
/ director, Christopher Nolan. How can anyone not drool from curiosity
in such a film that mainly pertains about the Thieves of Dream? To
simplify it, it is nothing less than about stealing or instilling an
idea to a marked man&#x27;s dream by six simultaneous dream experts, doing
it within as much as 3 layers of dream. Well alright, it (plot) does
sound complex and so as the film but I&#x27;m telling you, absolute justice
is done.<br /><br />From the start, no wasted time for maestro Hans Zimmer, doing his
inception of music to the audience that resonates till&#x27; the final
credit. Original score for films is his masterpiece as Nolan to his
storyboard, excellent collaboration. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not thinking twice
that an Academy Award for best direction and musical score are in this
film&#x27;s grasp with some other following.<br /><br />It wouldn&#x27;t be nice to expound more about this film, for all the
accolades it receives can already depict how real is this dream. It
should also not be compared to other science-fiction films, for this
film is in a superior league of its own. Nolan has his own distinct
touch that roots since Memento.<br /><br />This film sets Christopher Nolan as his &#x22;Leap of Satisfaction&#x22;. From
the ingenious, but budget tight Memento, he retained his own element
and enticed Warner Brothers to make Inception as a film superlative of
its kind. Now, ambitious as it can be, it has been a medium for him to
tell the world that &#x22;It pays to be a dreamer&#x22;.
