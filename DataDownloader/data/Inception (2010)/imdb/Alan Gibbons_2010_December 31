Read the films ranked below Inception in the top 250...and weep. Have
people lost their critical faculties? Yes, Inception is clever,
multi-layered, complex and intellectually challenging. It is also
heartless. It struggles to stimulate emotion. Cleverness replaces
impact. Di Caprio&#x27;s one-dimensional acting reinforces this sterility.
From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces
in a grim performance. He is grim about his kids, grim about the
folding graphics, grim about his team, grim about the task in hand. Of
the Matrix- plus effect I did like the folding city, but the ending was
portentous to the point of tedium. One very good litmus test of the
quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists
have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it.
Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within
a dream construct at the heart of the movie, with increasing
loquaciousness and qualifications. This isn&#x27;t plotting and it fails to
create a genuine narrative drive. Compare it to so many of the films
that come below this one in the rankings, Twelve Angry Men, Seven
Samurai, Goodfellas, Casablanca, Once upon a time in America, Citizen
Kane for goodness&#x27; sake. Don&#x27;t even mention films like Shawshank and
the Godfather which rank above it. This is a good film, possibly one of
the better films of the year. It is a very long way from a great one.
