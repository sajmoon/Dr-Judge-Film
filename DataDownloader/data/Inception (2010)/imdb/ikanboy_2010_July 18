Look at the Polls on this site. Liking the movie is age based. I&#x27;m
retired and while I liked it, I wasn&#x27;t enthralled by it. After awhile
CGI is CGI.<br /><br />It is a movie in which one has to surrender disbelief about disbelief
about disbelief. While the layers are fascinating on a quick
intellectual basis, they soon become ludicrous to believe in.<br /><br />The real problem I had is that there is way to much linear action for
it to resemble any dream sequence of mine, but I understand that having
a rapidly morphing and unworldly scenario would simply befuddle and
irritate. I did like the &#x22;is he or isn&#x27;t he&#x22; twist at the end.<br /><br />Sort of a mission impossible on LSD.
