Wow, what a ride. Just saw it for the first time, and even though it
felt overly convoluted, the visual effects are pretty interesting as
well as the story. It definitely should be on some of the bigger lists
of the year for its look into the subject of lucid dreaming and for its
original filmmaking. It&#x27;s a bit hard to wrap your mind around what
depths the movie goes for after only one viewing, but I cheated and
read the plot on Wikipedia beforehand to know what cues to look for as
well as to study where the team in the movie are going next.<br /><br />The believability of a man so consumed with his look into lucid
dreaming and its involvement with his family life and legal status in
the United States sounds simple enough on paper, but Nolan really
reached ridiculously far out there to make the story twist around on
itself, perhaps a little too much. As much as it&#x27;s praised, I don&#x27;t
really remember the soundtrack at all, and why Nolan needed Hans Zimmer
to pair with Johnny Marr I&#x27;ll never understand. The ending was touching
and it mirrored similar films such as What Dreams May Come, which I
thought was very weird and coincidental.<br /><br />Anyways, I enjoyed it. I found it very enjoyable even though most of
the parts dragged when it came to DiCaprio&#x27;s character dealing with his
projections of his wife. I found it was convenient the way Elle Page&#x27;s
character would end up finding a way into every aspect of Cobb&#x27;s life
in the first week of meeting the guy, too. So some of this story is
lacking logic, but it is sci-fi and should be followed only for as long
as the film allows. Overall, 7/10 stars because even if I don&#x27;t watch
it over and over again, I can respect the time put into the story and
the technical achievements they made with its filming.
