When I rate a movie, when I set a true critical opinion of a movie I
rate against other movies I&#x27;ve seen, obviously. For me, a perfect 10/10
is given to a select few movies. These movies were either perfect
pieces of film (Synechdoche, New York; There Will Be Blood), absolute
epics (LoTR), or purely mind-boggling (The Game, Memento). Inception
puts itself into a category all to its own. It was perfect film, It was
an absolute epic, and it was purely mind-boggling. The Cinematography,
the acting, the screenplay, the plot, and the score all were perfect.
Nolan showed his genius in this film And Hans Zimmer was the PERFECT
man for the score. All of that tied together, turned this into an epic.
A movie that literally uses the whole theater screen from beginning to
end and an action-packed climax. Finally there was the head-games Nolan
plays with the audience. After the movie came to a close, I sat staring
at the screen for 15 minutes, long after everyone else (besides the
people I saw the movie with) had left. I spent the next 30 minutes
without words to describe what I had just seen. My mind ran for a long
time trying to piece everything together. Thus...I really wish I could
give this movie a 10+ because it belongs in a category all to itself,
by having all of the different pieces that make a movie perfect in my
mind. However I am forced to bring it down a notch or two and give it a<br /><br />10/10 (Perfect)
