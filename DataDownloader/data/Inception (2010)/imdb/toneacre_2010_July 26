I saw the movie this past weekend and am questioning whether I saw the
same movie as some of the previous reviewers who have showered the film
with the word &#x22;masterpiece&#x22; and the like.<br /><br />First, the positives: It is very clever and complex. Nolan&#x27;s creativity
and intelligence is apparent in both the storyline and script. It is
incredibly well-filmed - the visuals were stunning. One of the fight
scenes in zero-gravity was amazing. Marion Cotillard was well cast -
she gave a great performance. Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s and Tom Hardy&#x27;s
characters and performances were also likable. The ambiguous ending was
very &#xE0; propos for the movie and made me smile.<br /><br />On the list of negatives: The length - this movie was way too long.
There were many needless scenes - especially of people fighting without
being able to tell who was fighting whom. It was as if the director was
given a lot of money and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to spend it all so he
just added more more more. That &#x22;more&#x22; didn&#x27;t add anything to the
storyline - it just became a loud, blurry mess of concurrent fights and
chases. The cuts back to the van falling interminably off the bridge
got to the point of torture - and not the good &#x22;edge-of-your-seat&#x22;
type. We get it...the various levels of the dreams happen at different
speeds - continuing to show the van falling became annoying, not
informative. The movie could have easily lost 30 mins of running time
without affecting the narrative in any way.<br /><br />Ellen Page - it is very hard to take her seriously. She is one-note
actress with no gravitas or credibility and was poorly miscast in a
role that required someone with depth.<br /><br />The explanations of what was happening (subconscious projections, why
characters stare, etc) sometimes left me thinking &#x22;huh?&#x22; Nolan got a
little too clever at times which distracted from being able to enjoy
the movie. I was left wondering what the heck they were saying.<br /><br />DiCaprio was his usual self - not good, not bad. Bland, unmemorable. He
doesn&#x27;t do anything really wrong - he&#x27;s just vanilla in everything he
does. You never forget that it&#x27;s Leonardo DiCaprio when you&#x27;re watching
his movies. It is interesting that this movie and DiCaprio&#x27;s last one -
Shutter Island - had very similar themes for his character - issues
with a dead wife haunting his thoughts - not knowing what was real or
not - wanting to see his kids again but not being able to. I felt as
though I had seen all this from &#x22;Inception&#x22; before in another movie. It
wasn&#x27;t any more interesting the second time around.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for the originality and the way it was
filmed. I would recommend that you take a blanket and pillow - you&#x27;re
in for the long haul.
