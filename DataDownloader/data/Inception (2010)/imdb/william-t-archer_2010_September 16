I thought Inception was a very entertaining, very effective movie that
succeeds as a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Nolan works everything
out nicely in visual terms, and he has a lot of good ideas -- the
imaginary world that Leonardo DiCaprio and his wife invent for each
other, for instance. It&#x27;s no small achievement to put together a giant
movie like this in a way where all the different elements come together
as smoothly and enjoyably as they do here. I think you could compare it
to some of Hitchcock&#x27;s lighter movies, like To Catch a Thief or North
by Northwest. Obviously the film can&#x27;t bear the weight of some of the
praise that&#x27;s being piled on it: to keep up the Hitchcock comparison,
you can&#x27;t really call Inception a masterpiece in the same league as
Vertigo. But on its own terms the film is terrific, and deserves to be
appreciated as a first-class action movie.
