In trying not to give too many plot details away, I&#x27;ll sum up the story
of Inception with this. A team of people use a device to go into
another person&#x27;s dream. While there they can do things such as extract
information, or even plant ideas. That&#x27;s about as far as I will go;
it&#x27;s the basic plot of the film that most people already know. Much
like District 9 and Avatar (at least for me) the less you know about
the film, the better.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, with Inception, has created a masterpiece. It&#x27;s hard
for me to heap such praise on the guy who has a small film resume under
his name, but he has, in my opinion, 3 films that will never be
forgotten. Memento, The Dark Knight and now Inception are all films
that I hold in high regard. It&#x27;s funny, right after The Dark Knight, I
heard Nolan was planning on making Inception, instead of a third Batman
film, I was a little ticked off. I wanted another Batman film, not some
side project. It&#x27;s ironic that I enjoyed Inception more than The Dark
Knight. <br /><br />Inception is a multi-layered film that has so much going on that it
might seem intimidating. Yet, you never lose sense of where you are.
Nolan is able to pull off this feat remarkably. People go into multiple
dreams and different levels and the viewer never loses a sense of
where. Nolan shows nothing but confidence and creativity in this film.
It&#x27;s not afraid to challenge you a little bit. I&#x27;m not saying it dives
into deep philosophical issues here, but it is enough juice to get
people thinking. <br /><br />Inception had me giddy and smiling all the way through. It&#x27;s very hard
for a film to do that. There was one scene in particular, where I was
not only in amazement in how utterly and ridiculously awesome it was,
but how simple it was to achieve. The scene is the hallway fight
sequence in which gravity no loner seems to be an issue. The simplest
form is used, moving and twisting the set, and Nolan makes it look ten
times better than anything else we&#x27;ve seen in recent years. <br /><br />Nolan creates films that people really need to wrap their heads around.
He is the next big thing. Hell, he is the big thing. He is the hottest
director right now that has yet misstep. Nolan and his brother have
created an original piece of art here, a crime caper if you will, that
involves going into the subconscious. The creativity is off limits, as
seen by the section of the city overlapping itself. I loved how they
have taken things that you feel and think about while dreaming and
incorporated it in to the film. In order to wake up you need a kick,
that feeling that you&#x27;re falling. I&#x27;ve felt it and I love that they
have incorporated things like that. <br /><br />There is a lot to talk about with Inception, even the ending, which in
my mind was Nolan having a little bit of fun. Obviously that question
would pop up sometime in the film, but Nolan knows not to go that
route. I think it&#x27;s there simply to get people talking while he laughs
at his own little joke. In any event, I&#x27;ll through my two cents in by
simply saying I&#x27;m an optimist. <br /><br />I hear that people aren&#x27;t that big a fan of Ellen Page. I think she did
fine holding her own against DiCaprio, who shines yet again much like
his tortured role in Shutter Island. My one complaint about her is that
she was a bit intrusive of characters and their dreams. The film feels
a little bit like a Batman reunion. Michael Cain has a small role, but
Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe both have integral parts to the story.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who I couldn&#x27;t stand on 3rd Rock From The Sun, is
quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Marion Cotillard has an
interesting role and her performance, other than DiCaprio, has the most
emotional depth to it. Every single addition to the cast is a perfect
mold for this world. <br /><br />I really loved this film, for it&#x27;s running time, it never drags. It&#x27;s
always interesting and engaging the viewer. It doesn&#x27;t slow down to
explain things, and doesn&#x27;t really need to. It might seem confusing at
first, but like Ellen Page&#x27;s character, the viewer is a quick learner.
Inception is the best film of this year and another achievement that
Nolan can be extremely proud of. I like that it&#x27;s an original idea and
it seems to be doing well, we need more films like Inception.
