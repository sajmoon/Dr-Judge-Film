Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb is a skilled thief in the dangerous art of
extraction, stealing valuable secrets from a marks subconscious during
their dream state. However, hung up on his personal past he puts his
team in peril in his last most difficult job.<br /><br />A fantastic yet flawed premise, only let down by a need to give the
audience too much repeated exposition about Cobb&#x27;s Children.<br /><br />Inception is a great blend of emotional drama and action, which is more
grounded than the likes of 1999&#x27;s Matrix and Thirteeth Floor,
Christopher Nolan delivers a clever special effects extravaganza, with
slick visuals that are used to enhance the story.<br /><br />The casting is excellent, with wealth of talent including Cillian
Murphy, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite and Sir Michael Caine who
light up the screen in the exceptional crafted scenes. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy are superb in pivotal supporting roles.
Leonardo DiCaprio is more than adequate, although their are distracting
similarities reminiscent of his troubled character Teddy Daniels in
Shutter Island (2010), this aside he gives a fine performance. Although
Ellen Page is given little character development she delivers and is
perfect in the limited role.<br /><br />This is modern sci-fi at its best, entertaining and thoughtful fun with
an seminal sub plot that sets it apart.
