Normally even the excellent movies lower their average rating
immediately after release, because there are always the curious ones
who go to watch the movie, but get disappointed. Christopher Nolan is a
surprise as a Director when analyzing that aspect. He arrives with
something truly unique and bewilders and mesmerizes everyone who gets
to see his movies, specially Inception, which Di Caprio described in a
very simple way on an interview to a Portuguese reporter &#x22;a journey of
a man who was trying to get back to his family&#x22;. How someone arrives at
#3 of Top 250 so soon (even considering the movie may not stay there)
and gets almost 70% of Excellent votes is also one of the reasons this
movie is a project not to be missed for those who love intelligent,
multi-layered and highly complex stories. The high praise for this
movie is totally deserved and should continue.
