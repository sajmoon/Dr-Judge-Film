This movie is the product of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s considerable
imagination. Like &#x22;Memento&#x22;, the story springs from an interesting
speculation, in this case what if it were possible to get inside
people&#x27;s dreams, either to steal information or to plant suggestions as
to future action. In the story, Leonardo&#x27;s character does this for a
living. He is retained by a large corporation to implant the idea into
the heir to a rival corporate behemoth the notion that he should break
up his father&#x27;s empire and set up on his own &#x96; actually quite
reasonable career advice (see Murdoch, Lauchlan). Nolan&#x27;s trick is to
film not only the dreams of the characters, but dreams within dreams
and even dreams within dreams within dreams. The dreams turn out to be
pretty action-packed, so that at times the whole thing seems in danger
of becoming an application to direct the next James Bond movie. However
despite about 90% of it being set in dreamland the story manages to
emerge and there is a satisfying resolution.<br /><br />There are shootouts, car chases, attacks on fortresses and
vertigo-inducing scenes in lift shafts and special effects galore (the
Paris folding street scape is a standout), but not much in the way of
sex. There is romance of a kind in that Leonardo pines for his late
wife, their life together being the subject of several flashbacks. For
reasons which become apparent, Leonardo can&#x27;t return to the US, but
this job might change all that. Michael Caine, who seems to be popping
up all over the place despite being 79 has a supporting role as his
mentor. As far as I can tell he is the only significant character who
doesn&#x27;t appear in a dream.<br /><br />I certainly hope that no-one tries tinkering with my dreams, but as
they never seem to make much sense and don&#x27;t as far as I can tell
direct what I do day to day it might not be a profitable pastime. I
suppose it might be different for someone who took them as auguries or
guides to the future. The Generals of Myanmar would be a good bunch to
start on.
