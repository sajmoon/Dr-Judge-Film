No words are enough to praise this extraordinary movie. In such a short
span of time the movie moves to #3 in IMDb top 250 list. This in itself
speaks volumes about its brilliance. I saw the movie four days ago and
still the impact feels inside my mind. A movie with a concept that I
guess was never worked on before, a script that is flawless, characters
that look so real and are so closely knit into the fabric of the movie,
mind boggling special effects. This movie has got it all. I would only
say The Avatar and Matrix are the only two in my opinion which match
this movie&#x27;s brilliance in terms of concept, visualization and
realization of the vision. A remarkable movie indeed
