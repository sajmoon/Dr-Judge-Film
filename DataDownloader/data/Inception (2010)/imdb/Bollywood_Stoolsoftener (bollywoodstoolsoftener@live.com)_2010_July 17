My take on the &#x22;remake&#x22; thing: Be it be a copy of PAPRIKA (awesome
Japanese anime). Bollywood is also planning a rip of that one, so
what&#x27;s the fuss all about. Agreed the story is not original, but that&#x27;s
the only weak point of the film. I haven&#x27;t seen the original but I
suspect if it could be any better than this. Both the lead actors
(Nicolas Cage and Christopher Nolan) give earth shattering
performances, with Cage being the real eye opener, as frankly I didn&#x27;t
expect such a work by him. The cinematography, direction, back ground
score, music are near perfect,which makes Inception technically
impeccable. Mahesh manjrekar has been sort of wasted. Both the lead
actors present a deadly combination of raw power, strength and
venerability. Nicolas Cage once again proves that only thing between
him and international acclaim is lack of good original scripts. A
brave, bold and successful attempt. worth watching. If you haven&#x27;t seen
PAPRIKA then its a must watch.
