The plot is hard to follow and understand in the beginning, but further
down the movie, it is becoming clearer. The plot is twisted, yet
interesting and keeping you on the edge.<br /><br />The movie addresses very interesting concepts that I thought about
before - dreams. Are they real? Why can&#x27;t we never remember the
beginning of our dreams? Can we control our dreams? Are we in someone&#x27;s
dreams?<br /><br />Don&#x27;t want to bore you with details, but this is the best movie I
watched in 2010 so far. It is worth watching in the theater and
definitely a good Saturday evening with your wife.
