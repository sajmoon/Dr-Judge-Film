There are very few movies created by directors that live up to
expectations. Inception is one of them. I hadn&#x27;t watched the trailer,
so I would see everything first-hand, once I saw the movie. Christopher
Nolan is a genius. I had great expectations for Inception AND The Dark
Knight. Both lived up to their expectations, surprisingly.<br /><br />Inception is a movie where you MUST pay your undivided attention.
Losing track for two minutes, may really confuse you. But giving your
concentration for two hours will REALLY treat your mind. If you like
smart movies, with a slight technological/futuristic aspect, and
thrills, this movie is Definitely for you.<br /><br />Inception is really a treat for the mind, and will keep you and your
friends/family having an entertaining discussion after it all.
