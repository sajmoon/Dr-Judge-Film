Let&#x27;s start by stating that this was the best sci-fi (apologies to the
late Forry Ackerman) that I have seen in a long long time. It succeeds
at every level. It began confusingly enough and had me wondering what
was going on but it wove itself together rather excellently and had me
in rapt awe throughout. This is an primary example of a film with
significant CGI that was overwhelmed by the story. A superbly crafted
tale with levels of complexity that never disappoints...even up to the
last seconds!!! The only down side is that it does require a bit more
intelligent involvement than the usual fare. I can see the eye-candy
generation becoming restless on this one. However, I WILL see this one
again and again. Recommended most highly!
