Over the top special effects movie that overshadow the plot and
interesting concept. Actually a very very simple plot. Visually
excellent, if you are impressed with studio effects that you see in so
many action movies. I guess.<br /><br />Simple plot line but complicated presentation that left me lost twice
lost until about 10 minutes later. Then, &#x22;I got it.&#x22; After one or two
of those you get the hang of it. This is how the movie is structured &#x96;
they tell you and then reinforce. Kindergarten for adults. It is all
very clear but you have to pay attention The problem is the action
scenes are over the top. How many snow chases have you seen? There are
bad guys that can&#x27;t shoot and good guys who seem to be wimps that beat
the heck out of the soldiers and thugs. This isn&#x27;t real life. How many
times do we need to watch the fight scene in the hotel hallway? Why do
they go on and on? Boy is this tedious! There is a lot of time and
special effects used for a simple plot line.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a ying and yang movie. I guess I would call it a cognition or
attribution movie coupled with overly done, seen it before shoot it up
scenes used to present what were interesting concepts. It is simple
action movie and I think it could have been a thinker&#x27;s movie.
