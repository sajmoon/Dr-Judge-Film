I am not the first to claim this, I read that on a Prestige or Batman
Begins board. But now I am in complete agreement with the one who said
it. Inception can arguably be Nolan&#x27;s best work yet, improving upon the
juggernaut which was The Dark Knight. But before I comment on
Inception, I want to review Nolan&#x27;s work first, shedding light on the
true genius he is. <br /><br />It all started with a short called Doodlebug. I won&#x27;t spoil anything,
because the film is about three minutes long, but Nolan starts one of
his trademarks: the twist. I don&#x27;t have a link but I know it is online
and a few searches should yield a result of the short. If you like
Nolan and his work, check it out. <br /><br />The next was Following, an ultra low budget film (around $6000), about
a young man who follows people just to see what they do and where they
are going. He also meets a character named Cobb... interesting name. It
features Nolan&#x27;s next genius trademark--the use of non-linear
storytelling. Overall a nice low budget film worth spending an hour and
ten minutes on. I recommend it. <br /><br />Now on to the complete mind f**k that was Memento. It is this film that
Nolan perfects his non-linear storytelling. Shown in almost complete
reverse, Memento follows a man named Leonard with a rare condition in
which he cannot form new memories. We learn early on he only lives for
revenge. HIGHLY recommend if you have not seen it yet. It really sets
the standard for non-linear storytelling. <br /><br />Insomnia was Nolan&#x27;s third full length film, and yet manages to add
something else: an all-star cast. It features Academy Award winners
Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and finally, one of the best actors of
his generation (maybe ever), Al Pacino. Pacino plays Detective Will
Dormer sent to Alaska to investigate a murder. Again, plot twists and
non-linear structure are used in this film. It is my least favorite of
Nolan&#x27;s films, but that doesn&#x27;t take away anything from it. It is still
very good.<br /><br />Now to the film that put Nolan on the map: Batman Begins. The Batman
franchise was all but dead in the water until Nolan got his hands on
it. Now it sets the standards for super-hero movies. Non-linear
storytelling, a great cast, and plot twists are all perfectly placed in
this. I personally view it as the second best super-hero movie ever
made, and is, in my opinion, a great movie altogether. <br /><br />To break up the Batman films, Nolan did a little movie called The
Prestige. Telling the story of two magicians, they are first friends,
then become rivals, then end up as enemies. Starring Christian Bale and
Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine, another all-star cast is present. The
non-linear structure in this movie is genius, so be prepared to think a
little bit. Overall a great film and one of my favorites. <br /><br />Now for the one everyone knows. I cannot say enough about The Dark
Knight. One thing I can say is it was the first movie to exceed my
expectations when they were that high. Heath Ledger&#x27;s joker is my
favorite character ever portrayed on screen, and will be for some time.
His Academy Award is well deserved. His passing is such a shame. And
although The Dark Knight did not get the Best Picture nomination, or
win, it certainly had effects on the Academy. By public outrage, the
2009 Academy Awards featured ten Best Picture Nominations instead of
the usual five. Without The Dark Knight, movies like Inglourious
Basterds, District 9, and yes, Avatar would have never come close to
being nominated. It was definitely the best film of 2008, the best
superhero movie ever made, and my favorite movie ever. <br /><br />Until about forty-five minutes ago. That&#x27;s when Inception ended and I
sat staring at the credits to what I had just witnessed. I am still
thinking about how the movie ended and it&#x27;s safe to say I will be
watching it at least two more times on the big screen. It surpasses The
Dark Knight in terms of how big it is by a long shot. The acting was
stellar by everyone, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. It&#x27;s a bit early,
but I think a Best Actor Nomination should be in order. Also another
trademark of Nolan, the casting of Michael Caine. It&#x27;s the fourth
consecutive film to feature him. <br /><br />Now on to the best aspect of this film, the storytelling. Again, the
non-linear structure is used, and is as perfect as it gets. Every shot
has meaning. All the dialog by the characters is relevant. Some may
complain it is lengthy, but if anything was cut, things would start to
be confusing. I could write page after page about how good the story
was, but you have to see it to truly experience it. The tag line &#x27;Your
mind is the scene of the crime&#x27; is all you should really know going
into this movie. I personally avoided (painfully, i might add) every
trailer, synopsis, and review i could of Inception before I saw it.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone however. It is not a late night,
brainless action movie like Crank or 2012. It requires the audience to
have smart brain-think. So on a scale of 1-10, Inception is about a 12.
This, without question, the best movie of the year. If The Academy
snubs Nolan out of this Oscar, I think I might kill someone. He should
have the Best Director award in the bag. However, to truly enjoy it,
you have to pay attention. It&#x27;s complex, but never confusing. If you
enjoy a great thriller that is anything but straightforward, this is
the movie for you. And be prepared to use your mind. =] <br /><br />And that&#x27;s all I got. 10/10
