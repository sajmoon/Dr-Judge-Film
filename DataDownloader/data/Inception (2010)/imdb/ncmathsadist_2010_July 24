This is not your typical summer film: it demands you pay careful
attention to a fairly complex but quite intriguing plot. It has managed
to steer clear of such banality as love interests that are grafted
hamhandedly and gratuitously onto a plot. <br /><br />This has all of the makings of a great science fiction classic. I am
surprised it was made: Hollywood demands &#x22;dumb;&#x22; said demand has gone a
long way toward turning off this film fan to the ever-burgeoning crop
of new movies that bristle with banality. I am pleased and amazed to
see a movie such as this appear in the filmic desert of high summer.<br /><br />When you go to see this, pay close attention to get the full nuances of
an intriguing story. Expect originality. Enjoy some fight and chase
scenes that are adrenaline-filled and fun. This movie represents a fine
effort in many ways. It will engage your intellect as well as your
emotions.
