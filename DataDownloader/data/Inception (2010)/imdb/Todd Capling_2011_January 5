This had a lot of talented actors and some nice visual effects. Sadly I
could not get into the story this movie was trying to convey. Just
didn&#x27;t make sense to me.<br /><br />Leonardo has been in two flops that I just saw within a year and the
other is Shutter Island.. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time trying to watch
either of these movies. In closing I always like to see Ken Watanabe.<br /><br />Some movies that were similar to this that I really liked were the
Matrix and The Fountain. This movie is nowhere near the caliber of
those movies and I find it hard to compare this movie to anything, but
way - WAY over rated. <br /><br />I really liked the movies Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and recommend
that and also Resident Evil : Afterlife with Milla Jovovich.
