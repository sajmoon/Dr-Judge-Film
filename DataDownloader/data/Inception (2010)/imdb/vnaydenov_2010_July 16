This was a neat movie, though complex to follow at times. I don&#x27;t think
10 out of 10 is in order, but I would say 8 out of 10 is well deserved.
Reminded me immensely of The Matrix at times. <br /><br />Visuals were beautiful. Music and dialogue were excellent, though many
times dialogue was hard to make out due to loud music drowning it out.
:( Acting was also great, though I am no big fan of DiCaprio, who did
as expected, (with that silly smirk on his face, almost like
Cloonie&#x27;s), but the rest of the actors were great.<br /><br />Overall a well-made movie with a plot full of fresh ideas. Go see it,
but do not set your expectations to the max, this way you do not come
out mildly disappointed. IMO, it is way too over-hyped.
