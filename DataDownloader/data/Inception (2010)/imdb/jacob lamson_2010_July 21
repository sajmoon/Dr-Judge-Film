Before you read this, don&#x27;t misunderstand me, Inception was a solid
movie. Far above average. The only thing I believe made it a
disappointment was the fact that it was a Christopher Nolan film, and
definitely NOT his best. It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the intensity,
complexity and intelligence of Memento. It didn&#x27;t achieve the strong
style and shocking brilliance of either Batman Begins or The Dark
Knight. It didn&#x27;t establish the sense of wonder that the Prestige left
the viewer feeling.<br /><br />Inception had an incredible concept. One that I believe could have set
the base for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s most impressive film to date, but he
took this concept and threw 180 million dollars into special effects
rather than a solid story and really Grade A acting. Now DiCaprio&#x27;s
performance in Inception was excellent but most of the accompanying
actors were average action flick performances. Which was a
disappointment because in Nolan&#x27;s greater films, he usually puts the
acting of the side characters before the lead (Memento: Teddy. TDK: The
Joker). <br /><br />I feel like Chris Nolan got wrapped in by Hollywood and decided to make
an action film with a psychological plot, than a psychological thriller
with some action sequences. Not his most intelligent, or captivating
film to date, but still worth the price of admission.
