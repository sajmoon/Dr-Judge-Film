An absorbing subject.Entering someone&#x27;s mind and sharing his dreams
,maybe curing him and killing his demons.How tempting! Although by no
means completely uninteresting -it&#x27;s thoroughly entertaining-
&#x22;Inception&#x22; does not rise to the occasion.To be really successful ,it
would have needed a strong central character,an ambiguous one-I&#x27;m
obviously speaking of the character,not the actor- ,it would have
needed an elaborate screenplay .Instead of it ,all we get is dime store
psychoanalysis, simplistic dreamlike sequences,childish politics...<br /><br />The dreams are particularly poor.If you want to see great dreams (or
nightmares) just pick up Bergman&#x27;s &#x22;Wild strawberries &#x22; ,Hitchcock&#x27;s
&#x22;Spellbound&#x22; ,Polanski&#x27;s &#x22;Rosemary&#x27;s baby &#x22;or the entire Bunuel canon
-Bunuel is second to none when it comes to direct dreams- This was a
total wipeout: not one minute amount, not a smattering, of anything
worth seeing. I usually like DeCrappio but he had nothing to work with
on this flopperoo.
