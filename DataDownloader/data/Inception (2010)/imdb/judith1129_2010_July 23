Really, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was Sci-Fi at its
worst - a thoroughly impossible idea unmitigated by any shade of Well,
Maybe. And it was compounded by the fun ability of the movie-makers to
cut and paste the scenes in an unconnected fashion, making a whole that
is absolutely incomprehensible. This isn&#x27;t brilliant, it is bizarre. It
isn&#x27;t entertaining, because certainly if you go for entertainment and
have to spend the entire 2 hours and 28 minutes figuring it out you
will feel cheated and bored, not entertained. How a movie like this
gets so many high ratings is a mystery and makes me worry. Will all
movies go in this direction? Maybe its a cult movie, maybe that&#x27;s it.
There is plenty of &#x22;action&#x22; (read, endless fights, car chases, etc.),
and the sound track is Really Loud. At one point most of the characters
are for some unclear reason in the same white space-like suits with
white head gear that hides their faces. You see anonymous white suits
battling it out. You go from Who&#x27;s who? to Who cares? in a very short
time. This is a great movie to go to if you generally spend your time
in the movies texting or otherwise not paying attention. Miss this one
if you can.
