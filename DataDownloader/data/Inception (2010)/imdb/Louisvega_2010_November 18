While not a bad film i am a little bemused how it has such a high
rating. I think 7 out of 10 is about fair as it is pretty far from
being original. While watching, it continually reminded me of other
movies. From any recent James bond film to &#x27;Total recall&#x27; to &#x27;The
Matrix&#x27; to &#x27;Strange Days&#x27;. Its all been done before! And to be given a
higher score than such greats as &#x27;The Shining&#x27; &#x27;One Flew Over The
Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&#x27; or &#x27;Deer Hunter&#x27; is just plain wrong. Maybe a
certificate over a &#x27;12a&#x27; would of helped it, but i&#x27;m still not
convinced.Where as i can think of several films in the past 5 years
that would of benefited from a higher certificate. Hollywood needs to
realise you cant please all of the people all of the time...And thats
OK! Don&#x27;t make what would of been a good 18 certificate movie in to a
&#x27;12a&#x27; or &#x27;15&#x27; just because it appeals to more people...After all,
movies are an art form and art is subjective AND objective
