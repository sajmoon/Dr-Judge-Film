Ten years back, in the year 2000, everyone was talking about a movie
called Memento. Critics gave it five stars and in spite of being
relatively unknown in the popular cinema world everyone who mattered
looked up and noticed. Much more than the movie which was remade in
several languages a new director cum writer came on the fore front.
Christopher Nolan.A decade has passed and he has given us a number of
critically acclaimed movies which also bloomed at the box office,
breathed life into the Batman franchise which was dead and buried after
Batman and Robin.<br /><br />Now he has come one up with another masterpiece, Inception. Without
giving much away, Leonardo plays a thief who is quite adept at stealing
secrets from the human mind.He has to come up with one final job to be
able to return back home.And so onwards the action unfolds.Its so
refreshing to see that Leo after becoming famous via that, ooohh soo
cute role in Titanic has not lost his way as an actor.The process
started from The Gangs of New York and he continues to excel.Ellen Page
does a competent job with Ken Watanbe coming up with some great one-
liners.Micheal Caine also gets the obligatory role as he does in every
Nolan movie.<br /><br />With Nolan at the helm, a incredible but plausible story, some great
acting and an intriguing climax which will not let you even blink,
Inception is brilliant movie making at its best.All the elements in the
movie suit it to a T. Everything falls into place in the end....well
almost...It questions your intelligence, it makes you think, well woven
into the heist is the personal life angle which keeps on haunting
Leo....a memory...an incident which tends to almost mess up his careful
well drafted plans. <br /><br />Like it or don&#x27;t looks like Nolan has come up with another winner which
is well on its way on becoming a cult movie.Go Watch it............<br /><br />My rating.........10.5/10 Christopher.......Take a bow !!!!!
