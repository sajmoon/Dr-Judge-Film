The concept of Inception is a very appealing one, and the film is
wonderfully inventive. It&#x27;s also not as confusing or effects-heavy as
some have said - the story is actually very well constructed. That just
makes it all the more frustrating, because Inception has some very hard
to define flaws that prevents it from being a truly great movie - most
of all the very uninteresting characters. It&#x27;s not exactly that they&#x27;re
flat - they&#x27;re all convincing enough and the dialog is fluent enough,
but none of them deserve any true emotion or interest from the viewer.
It&#x27;s a good movie by any measure, and yet - like every previous
Christopher Nolan movie - stops just short of being a fantastic one.
