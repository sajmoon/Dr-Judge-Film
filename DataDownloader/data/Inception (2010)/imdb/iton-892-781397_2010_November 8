People must have gone insane!!! I usually don&#x27;t give my opinion in
blogs, forums etc. because it makes me feel like a dog barking in the
dark at unknown strangers. And I don&#x27;t like this registration forms and
surveys and other marketing bullshit tools that sites like this are
using. But... this film and its absurd rating provoked me so much that
I had to brake my principles. I have seen A LOT of movies. Thousands of
movies. And I(please forgive my lack of modesty)consider my self an
intelligent person. At least a little bit over the average level. And I
am mad at this movie and at the 99% of all these people that with their
votes made me believe that this movie deserves 148 minutes of my life.
No it doesn&#x27;t deserve even these 50 which I generously gave it...
Despite of all its &#x22;layers&#x22;, special effects, computer graphics and
multimillion dollar budget, this movie is simply a flat, pointless,
boring and not even entertaining bullshit. It insults me, because it&#x27;s
made for elementary school kids, uses their language, verbally explains
every step like in the mute films of the twenties, and pretends to be a
high class entertainment for smart people. Yesterday I watched 4 or 5
European and South American movies. None of them had budget higher than
15 million dollars. Inception doesn&#x27;t worth even a tenth of the worst
of them with its 160 million dollar budget. Apart from the special
effects I don&#x27;t see anything good in it. Acting is bad, dialogue is
worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself
watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn&#x27;t bear
anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love
Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B
rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment
away from everyday stress. This one just made me checking my watch
every 2 minutes to see when it would finally end... Basta!!!<br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!
