Okay. Here&#x27;s the thing&#x85; I think we can safely say that this was the
movie the majority of audiences were waiting for this summer. This was
indeed the event pic that everyone knew about, talked about, and even
debated about&#x97; before even actually seeing it.<br /><br />One of the best things about Inception was how helmer Christopher Nolan
was able to shroud this summer tentpole in so much secrecy up until the
release date. Like a top secret government mission. <br /><br />Anyway, Inception has finally been released from its cage and has
certainly delivered the total trip it promised in the mind-bending
trailers. Leo DiCaprio, coming off of another 2010 mind-f**k, Shutter
Island, plays Dom Cobb, someone who navigates people&#x27;s dreams and
pilfers vital ideas from the heart of their mind. An act he is paid to
do.<br /><br />A proposition arises that can possibly send the exiled Dom Cobb back to
America, to finally see his kids again. But this proposition is of
course, no easy task. It involves the art of &#x27;inception&#x27;, or in other
words, the act of planting an idea in someone&#x27;s dream, rather than
stealing. Together with his team, including a fantastic Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, wonderful Ellen Page, and a deliciously charming Tom
Hardy, Cobb sets off on the near-impossible mission.<br /><br />The film hardly lets up- a fact that may frustrate those who are intent
on &#x27;understanding&#x27; every minuscule thing. But that shouldn&#x27;t be the
main focus of this film. The main point is easy enough to follow and
that&#x27;s really all you need to worry about. Just let Inception take you
by the hand and go with it because you&#x27;ve probably never seen anything
like this. Take a walk into Chris Nolan&#x27;s seriously beautiful
subconscious. This guy needs to share his dreams with the rest of
Hollywood.
