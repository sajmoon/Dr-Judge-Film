I have just read some of the bad reviews on Inception ,and I have to
say that I totally agree with them.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely overrated,it&#x27;s
humorless,pretentious,overlong,underacted,repetitive....<br /><br />But for me,the worst thing is that it&#x27;s a strange case of a boring
heist movie (strange because heist movies are generally entertaining
ones).<br /><br />Considering that,apparently in dreams,everything is so much complicated
hadn&#x27;t it been much easier doing it for real ? I think the real
INCEPTION the movie is referring to,is the idea that this movie is
actually good. May be I was not dreaming that day !!!
