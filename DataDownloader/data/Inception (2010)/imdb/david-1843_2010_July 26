It is unbelievable that this film has received such accolades by
reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real
life its own concept: planting in the viewer&#x27;s mind from the inception
that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film
business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film
promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and
eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what
a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to
see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but
have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in
fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This
would be the dullest film I have ever seen, almost anyway, and everyone
I spoke to - even strangers - after the showing said that from its
INCEPTION they could hardly wait for it to finish. Money has scaled new
heights of desperation to be made. Shame on all the actors who
contributed to this disgraceful exercise in megalomaniacal
money-making!
