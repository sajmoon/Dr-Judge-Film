this movie is to much for the mind if you want to understand it all,
and make the most out of it. you must have a pretty good IQ. i couldn&#x27;t
deal with it. i love wine. but no alcohol with this movie. you must
concentrate on everything that happens. actions scenes are there for
the story. DiCaprio is good. but Christian bale ie the fighter is
awesome. way better. 8,9 on IMDb?? why?? because people don&#x27;t
understand. nolan is great in batman begins. that&#x27;s my favorite movie.
it could be that iam all wrong and that this is al really good movie!.
just must see it before you judge. go play the movie. its great!
hehehe. its just like a dream. what????
