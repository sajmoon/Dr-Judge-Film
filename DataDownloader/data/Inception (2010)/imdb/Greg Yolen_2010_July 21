Something about INCEPTION kept hitting me as a re-statement of MEMENTO,
with $200,000,000 to spend. The big emotional revelation is similar in
more ways than one, while the bells and whistles here dwarf the
neo-noir economy of Nolan&#x27;s breakout indie. With every movie, the man&#x27;s
budgets get bigger, hey good for him, and this is by far his biggest
non-Batmovie. He&#x27;s grown accustomed, perhaps, to making those movies,
but that now familiar style bleeds over here, (booming Hans Zimmer
score check, Wally Pfister helicopter shots check,) when INCEPTION
could have benefited from being weirder by a quarter. For all the
possibilities a film about a dreamworld presents, it&#x27;s disappointing
that Nolan sticks so close to what he knows. From INSOMNIA to BATMAN
BEGINS to THE PRESTIGE, Nolan puts some sort of snowbound castle in
almost every movie he makes. Cue act three of INCEPTION, set in: some
sort of snowbound castle. Hey, the guy likes ice! Leave him alone! But
Tom Hardy skiing around this fortress picking off baddies like he&#x27;s
James Bond isn&#x27;t exactly the stuff from which dreams are made&#x85; Though
it was interesting to read that in the press rounds for INCEPTION,
Nolan let it slip that he&#x27;d like to direct a James Bond installment
himself. Whether that&#x27;s an empty promise remains to be seen, (hint: it
will never happen ever,) but the finale of this film shows potential
for a Nolan Bond. That is to say, it&#x27;s a sequence that might have
worked better in another movie.<br /><br />Read more at my blog: STEVENSPIELBLOG.COM
