I truly cannot see another film overtaking Inception this year. The
Academy should get this in their memory banks now. Although how can one
forget the mastery of this film? The Academy has shown that it will not
award the top honors to films in certain categories very often.
Inception is in several of those categories. It is a blockbuster, it is
in both the sci-fi and action genres, it is a summer release, and it is
filled with special effects. Well, the Academy needs to throw out the
book with this one.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has managed to do something nearly impossible in
film-making. He has taken a trippy, sci-fi concept, backed it up with
incredible special effects, and applied a brilliantly crafted story to
it. Then he directed a critically acclaimed cast through the story. The
product is nothing short of legendary.<br /><br />These elements have never co-existed in a film so flawlessly. Even if a
writer can come up with a story that makes us care about an implausible
plot, it is nearly impossible to convey that on film. Nolan makes us
believe, and he makes us feel normal believing something so
far-fetched. Many before have tried, but nobody has succeeded like
Nolan has with Inception.
