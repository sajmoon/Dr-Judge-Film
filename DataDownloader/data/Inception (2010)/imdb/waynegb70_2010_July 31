i cant believe how overrated this film is! its been done so many times
before. dark city, matrix, the cell even nightmare on elm street (going
in to grab freddy, and being awoke by a friend, alarm clock or candle),
which are all better. i cant see anything original at all about this
script and can imagine there will be lots of forums discussing the
confusing story line. if you want this sort of deep film your better
off with 12 monkeys or vanilla sky. i feel as if I&#x27;ve wasted two and a
half hours of my life and 15 pounds out of my pocket. very very
disappointed. everything leonardo di caprio does always seems to get
lots of praise, but can only think of a handful of good films he has
done.
