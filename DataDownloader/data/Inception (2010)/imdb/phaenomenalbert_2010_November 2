in order not to spoil anything, I will not give away any details of the
story itself.<br /><br />the performance of the cast is convincing as to be expected. the movie
is definitely well shot and has the ingredients to please a broad
audience: talented and popular actors, a fast pace, action, brilliant
animation and most importantly a storyline interesting enough to
capture the viewer&#x27;s attention.<br /><br />there is one thing left to be desired: the main character, Cobb
describes his work as a chance to create things that never existed. one
would expect to see just that in the dreamworld being built by Cobbs
and his team. unfortunately, the movie falls short right there.<br /><br />nevertheless a movie worth watching. but Nolan can do way better.
