The hype-machine has done it again! Convinced everyone that if you
don&#x27;t find this movie outstanding then you are just not that smart.<br /><br />The plot is really not that hard to understand. Cobb job is to steal
ideas from people&#x27;s minds, which is done in their dreams during
dream-sharing. Cobb wants to go home to his children, but cannot
because he has been accused of murdering his wife. By planting a dream
in a persons mind, some powerful people will clear his name, so he can
see his children again. Pretty simple.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie is the plot holes and irregularities
in the rules set up during the movie. Eg. what is the point to the
architect? How can the dream devices be in the dreams whit-in a dream
(did the architect put them there, and how?)? You can hear through many
levels of dreaming, but not feel twisted gravity? Can people just fall
a sleep on demand? etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Even if one did not care about plot holes, there is an even bigger
problem with the movie! There are plots going on at the same time on
four levels of dreaming. Because we have to jump back and forth all the
time the plot loses its intensity and depth.<br /><br />On the positive side, the movie has excellent acting and visuals. The
idea is relatively original (cough the matrix, cough Tron, cough any
worlds-within-another-word movies). Its good to see some new-thinking
in Hollywood instead of crap like Transformers, sequels and remakes.<br /><br />All together the movie is nothing but mediocre. Lets hope that The
Expendables will live up to the hype, else this will have been a pretty
bad action movie season!
