There have been many films in the past made about dreams and/or
centered around them, but never has there been one quite as accurate,
original and thought provoking as this. Without giving anything away
the film gives you various pieces of information to choose from in this
mystery-maze set in the mind action thriller, and has you trying to
piece them all together and all the while it keeps your attention and
doesn&#x27;t lose you. The emotional aspect of Inception is the center of
the film and the beauty lies in the cinematography, but the brilliance
of Inception is the fact that it portrays itself as a summer action
flick, when years down the road people will be looking back on it and
changing their minds on what the film as a whole is and what the story
ended up being. Christopher Nolan has created something very special
here, and has proved himself to be a true modern day magician in
Hollywood and with good reason.
