I enjoyed it. It wasn&#x27;t excellent, it wasn&#x27;t dreadful; maybe just above
average, but definitely not a 9.1.<br /><br />I actually looked forward to DiCaprio&#x27;s performance, as he&#x27;s a great
actor. However, I was somehow disappointed; he hasn&#x27;t convinced me at
all, and sometimes I felt the part was not made for him. I&#x27;m also a big
fan of Michael Caine, whose performance I only thought of as average.<br /><br />I admit the idea of the movie was intriguing, but the plot was way too
complicated, without being complex.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing, but is not worth a 9.1, or to be called a
masterpiece.
