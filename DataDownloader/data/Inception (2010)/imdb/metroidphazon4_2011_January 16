when Hollywood starts to mess with your mind they get an
audience!inception is a well done masterpiece by christopher nolan and
will remain that way forever.when you first watch the movie the story
line is confusing but once you watch it a second time you should grasp
it. confusion was mainly due to the fact that sometimes you couldn&#x27;t
tell if the characters were in a dream or not.but like i said watching
the movie a second time makes you understand.inception rules the sci-fi
genre along with some other great hits like star wars and terminater
but overall i think inception is the best one of them all. I don&#x27;t
recommend this movie for little kids for 2 reasons.one it is too
violent.two they wont get whats happening at all.this is a movie you
really have to pay lots of attention to as it is a fast paced
movie.another interesting aspect of the movie is how they go into
dreams within dreams.its a cool aspect and makes the conflict change a
lot!check out inception and you wont be disappointed!!
