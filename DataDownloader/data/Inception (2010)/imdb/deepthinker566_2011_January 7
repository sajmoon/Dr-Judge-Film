This is why I like Christopher Nolan, His films are the perfect example
of exhilarating pieces of cinema, such as Memento, Insomnia, The
Prestige, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception is his best
he&#x27;s done.<br /><br />The film stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine,
Tom Berenger, etc.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) is able to use his unique skills to his
advantage - he can enter people&#x27;s minds through their dreams and
thereby learn their secrets. He is a thief for hire but Japanese
businessman Mr. Saito has a somewhat different proposition for him. He
wants Cobb to enter the mind of Robert Fischer Jr., who is about to
inherit his father&#x27;s massive business empire, to plant a simple notion:
to break-up his father&#x27;s conglomerate and sell it off. In return, Saito
will make it possible for Cobb to freely return to the US where he is
currently wanted by the police. Cobb accepts and assembles his team
with a plan to plant the idea deep in Fisher&#x27;s mind by generating a
series of dreams within dreams so that he eventually thinks he came up
with the idea himself. As the intended deception grows ever more
complex, Cobb has to deal with his own emotions and feelings of guilt,
which are projecting themselves into the dreamspace. Cobb has to deal
with the eventual question of what is real and what is only a dream.<br /><br />Nolan has a excellent mind in science fiction, this could be the winner
of Best Picture who knows? <br /><br />Inception get 10 stars.
