Could this possibly be the same Christopher Nolan that gave us the
classic &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22;? What a letdown! What a sleep inducing,
pretentious, rip off this mess was. Even with the obvious attempt by
Nolan to instill a sense of sophistication with his use of high Brahman
pseudo scientific dialog, it still couldn&#x27;t save this bow-wow of a
film, the script must have been written by somnambulist. If the
producers of Inception would have changed all the high brow dialog and
spoken plain English it still wouldn&#x27;t have made any sense. I was
almost snoring and in my own dream state of Inception after sitting
through what seemed to be the whole first half of the movie, listening
to Leonardo Di Caprio keep describing how the whole Inception theory
worked, wake me up when it&#x27;s over! Then when &#x22;Cobb&#x22; (LDC), goes to his
angry Father In Law for assistance he gets a young college student as
an assistant, Say Whaaat! The scenes concerning Cobbs dream life with
his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) were beside the point and, or better
yet there was no point. Those special effects that Cobb shared with his
assistant, the college girl, were just unimaginative and boring,
buildings folding up and turning upside down, huh? what&#x27;s the appeal in
that? And we keep reading about the new boy wonder replacement for the
brilliant Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are you kidding? This
scrawny pencil neck could never walk in Heath Ledgers shoes! Actually
none of the actors in this movie instilled any emotion or gave any
credibility to their characters, they were syrupy and one-dimensional.<br /><br />Also the too loud, obnoxious, Wagnerian like, music score was driving
me to grind my teeth and wish for drink by the time the movie finally
ended, and it was still blasting away as we escaped this torment and
hit the exit. No matter how loud, heroic, and operatic the music score
it still couldn&#x27;t save this dog of a movie. Great science fiction
movies would be on the level of &#x22;Blade Runner, Alien, District 9,
Predator, even Avatar, this attempt at that genre fell flat on it&#x27;s
face, it was too long, boring, and narcissistic. I feel more suspense
and get more action when fishing, I&#x27;m 64 years old and have been
watching movies all my life, I can&#x27;t remember watching a more
pretentious, precious, and sleep inducing attempt at a movie. Batman
couldn&#x27;t save this film.
