Inception.. hooly hell, what a movie. I was crying with tears of
laughter, or something like that. I couldn&#x27;t keep my eyes off the
screen for the entirety of the film -- or more like the last 1&#xBD; hours.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is great, and so are the other people in it. Marion
Cotillard is beautiful, and that chick from Juno is super-sweet and
funny. What can I say, I just finished watching it, and I&#x27;m simply
awe-struck. I didn&#x27;t like it at all in the beginning, was almost close
to turning the whole thing off - luckily I didn&#x27;t.<br /><br />Now I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;M real..<br /><br />I have nothing much to say, that&#x27;s maybe a testament to the power of
this film. If you haven&#x27;t seen it, I recommend. You might not like it,
or then love it.
