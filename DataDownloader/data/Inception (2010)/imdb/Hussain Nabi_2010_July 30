I was a bit skeptical before watching the movie. I thought that this
big fuzz about it was for nothing, though i was really so eager to
watch it since i&#x27;m a big fan of DiCaprio&#x27;s latest work. But now that
i&#x27;ve seen the movie, i can just say that this fuzz was actually for a
BIG thing!<br /><br />Nolan has turned a story into a master piece in the world of motion
pictures. That is definitely a classic. The idea is so original and so
mind moving. You might get lost a bit at the beginning, but as you
watch you get hooked more and more into the story that you seriously
don&#x27;t want to blink your eyes as you might miss a thing. Because,
maybe, if you miss a tiny little thing, you might miss the whole point.<br /><br />The effects are just so perfectly done. You will really enjoy the dream
effects that this movie is just so full of. I even feel that my dreams
will have similar effects from now on, or maybe I will force my dreams
to have them ;)<br /><br />DiCaprio did out perform himself in this movie, as usual. The whole
cast was amazing. The different dreaming environments makes watching
this movie so not boring. Though the story gets a bit complicated as it
goes on, but the good thing is that it makes you work your mind and
connect the points as if you&#x27;re reading a novel, except that it got
some amazing visuals.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching &#x22;Inception&#x22;.....and just when i thought that
this summer hasn&#x27;t given us any remarkable blockbuster....I guess I was
wrong.....Because &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not a summer blockbuster......It&#x27;s an
ALL TIME one !
