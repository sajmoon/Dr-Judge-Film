First, let me say that the acting was good, and that Leonardo DiCaprio
is a good actor. The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do
with the actors&#x27; performances.<br /><br />I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT
of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my
imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you
could do with a concept like inception in people&#x27;s dreams is almost
endless.<br /><br />But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto?
Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched
this.<br /><br />And the plot, if that&#x27;s what you call it, is nothing. It&#x27;s convoluted
minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It&#x27;s like they made
it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it&#x27;s not!
About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable.
Even so, I thought, &#x22;It&#x27;s about the journey not the ending. Right?&#x22;
Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams
about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of
explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not
thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain
the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been
militarized.<br /><br />What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that
seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to
become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better
than this.<br /><br />Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks
can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be
thought-provoking..... But then there&#x27;s the looooong drawn out mushy
ending that breaks up the action and isn&#x27;t befitting an action flick at
all.<br /><br />So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a
movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while
simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible
ending.<br /><br />Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars
