2011_January 4 
I thought this movie was going to very good and had to wait a few days
for it to show up available at the Red Box kiosk. I rented a second
movie as well and put that one on first in anticipation that Inception
would be my &#x22;special&#x22; movie of the evening.<br /><br />Well, it was not special at all. I quit about halfway through. I kept
thinking to myself that everything you saw must be a dream and maybe it
was but I could not sit through the whole thing. All of the criticisms
have been levelled at this movie already and I won&#x27;t repeat them and
just add that I endorse those that happened before half of the movie
was done. I did enjoy Momento but not this load of tripe.
