For all its flaws (and there are some), &#x22;Inception&#x22; succeeds as a
star-studded blockbuster with a brain. Christopher Nolan has, yet
again, crafted a work that manages to inspire both thought and awe: a
rare feat, to be sure. As the film opens, the audience is thrown
mercilessly into a scene of cascading schemes and chaotic
confrontations. We, as audience members, feel uneasy; we don&#x27;t know
exactly where we stand on the characters or the situation at hand, and
that&#x27;s the way Nolan wants it (talk about &#x27;in medias res&#x27;). By the time
the first wave of tension subsides, another approaches in its wake.
This new wave proves to be a tsunami; as the plot unfolds, revelations
spring free, character motives come into question, and the film&#x27;s dream
world expands exponentially. <br /><br />The plot of &#x22;Inception,&#x22; without giving anything away, goes something
like this. Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s Cobb, a sort of &#x22;dream thief,&#x22; takes on
one final assignment, courtesy of Ken Wantanabe&#x27;s corporate kingpin.
Cobb assembles a team, ranging from Joseph Gordon- Levitt&#x27;s crafty
pretty-boy to Ellen Page&#x27;s boyish architect. Things get a little crazy
as the mission proceeds (certain characters just might be holding back
some important information), and a nail-biting spectacle takes the
stage.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know how much Christopher Nolan was paid for this screenplay,
but I can guarantee that it wasn&#x27;t enough. The story examines the very
nature of dreams; it explores their nuances, their limitations, and
their possibilities, while at the same time exploring some of the
science behind them. When characters have to choose between their dream
worlds and reality, we have to consider which option we would embrace.
When characters leap from layer to layer, we consider our own dream
complexes. At the same time, a serpentine heist film unfolds on screen.
While the plot does require the occasional suspension of disbelief, it
plays by its own rules for the greater part of its running time.<br /><br />In fact, most of &#x22;Inception&#x27;s&#x22; shortcomings have nothing to do with the
plot. Apart from a few over-explained monologues at inappropriate
times, the script succeeds ferociously. However, some problems arise
with the characters and their actor counterparts. While Leonardo
DiCaprio&#x27;s performance doesn&#x27;t hit the wrong notes, it doesn&#x27;t always
hit the right ones either. DiCaprio has a compelling voice and look,
especially early in the film, but trouble brews when the emotional
turmoil strikes his character. Rather than reach for new dramatic
heights, he settles for simply adequate deliveries. As such, it becomes
difficult to invest in his character as anything more than &#x22;Man 1.&#x22;
Some other talents in the cast, while solid, are given too little to
do. Ellen Page is reduced to the classic &#x22;angel on my shoulder&#x22;
stereotype, and Tom Berenger and Cillian Murphy are just asked to look
concerned for most of the film&#x27;s duration. Still, Joseph Gordon Levitt
looks spiffy, Tom Hardy makes great comic relief, and no one does all
too poorly. <br /><br />All in all, &#x22;Inception&#x22; makes for a great time at the theater. It
sparks conversation, it moves briskly, and it looks brilliant on the
big screen. If Hamlet were to see the dreams put on display here, he
might just have shuffled off that mortal coil.
