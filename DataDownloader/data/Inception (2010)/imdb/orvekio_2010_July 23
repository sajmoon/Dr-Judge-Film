Wow, do I wish I could describe the way this film made me feel (and the
way it made me think!). All I can say is Huge, Beautiful, near
Metaphysical ideas so tightly woven together and well executed you are
left thinking about those ideas hours later (JOY!). Having a thought
experiment afterwards by placing yourself in such extraordinary places
and situations you may find yourself questioning what we &#x22;know&#x22; about
such reality(&#x27;s). The mind is that powerful, right? I found the story,
direction, production, acting, and FX, to be a hairs breadth from
perfect. It goes fast (despite being fairly long) and you have to pay
attention, but that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because your eyes wont want
to leave the screen.<br /><br />Must see.
