After when Christopher Nolan directed, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, his next film
was, &#x22;Inception&#x22;. Just like what the title say&#x27;s, &#x22;One word to describe
this film: Awesome&#x22;.<br /><br />What make&#x27;s this movie awesome is the story. A guy rounds up a group of
people to pull the ultimate heist by going into peoples dream&#x27;s. Now
that&#x27;s a great story. The actor&#x27;s did a great job. I found Leonardo
DiCaprio&#x27;s performance as Cobb really great. But the thing I really
loved in this movie, were the special effects. They were really
amazing.<br /><br />So overall, &#x22;Inception&#x22;, is a great movie that&#x27;s really worth watching
if you&#x27;re into crime films or just looking for a good movie to watch.<br /><br />5/5
