This movie must quite literally be a DREAM come true for many.<br /><br />First, for Mr.Nolan himself. If he is by any chance watching the
screening of the movie amongst general public, he must be delighted
with the fact that: 50% of the audience would be simply spellbound, 40%
must be scratching their heads till they start balding, 10% would be
shouting &#x22;I hate Mr.Nolan&#x22;, for he took them into a maze that lasted
for 150 minutes and did not tell them the way out of it. Sheer genius!
Is he a human being at all? Then, for the cast. If they ever had dreams
of acting in roles that are so complete and original in every possible
sense, then they can stop acting now and retire, for all they can dream
of has been achieved in a single movie. Hats off to the entire cast!
Last but never the least, for us - the audience. This is what we
secretly hope when we buy a ticket for a movie, that we get our money&#x27;s
worth, for every cent we pay for. I am pretty sure most people wont
even hesitate to pay for the second time to watch the masterpiece that
is Inception.<br /><br />And oh by the way, Spoilers? Ha-ha! If you have not watched the movie,
do not worry a jot. No amount of spoilers can reveal the actual story.
This movie is beyond all that. Just make sure you go in with a open
mind, because when you come out of the theater, I bet you would have
thousands of ideas running around in your head like headless chicken! <br /><br />It is a movie experience unparalleled! We doff our hat in respect
Mr.Nolan, for your Idea has been etched onto our mind, probably
forever. You Sir, have achieved Inception.
