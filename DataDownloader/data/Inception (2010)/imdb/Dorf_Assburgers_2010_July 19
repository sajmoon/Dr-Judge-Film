What applies to the cooks and broth applies to CGI and movie too.
Inception was a disappointment to say the least. The only saving grace
is the VFX... especially the Bollywood ripoffs.<br /><br />The storyline was the same old Bollywood formula of a stolen plot and
scenes taken from other films, in this case from PAPRIKA (2006). The
casting was OK but their acting was terrible! Leonardo DiCaprio looks
bored all through the movie. He is better as a munnabhai or a Raghu
Shivalkar. Ken Watanabe&#x27;s role is quite forgettable. The grunge clothes
and the fake tattoos don&#x27;t really go well on him. Ellen Page and Tai-Li
Lee looked hot. Cillian Murphy was horrible!! First half of the movie
was still bearable... second half was more torturous on the audience
than on the villains!!! The best part of the movie was Michael Caine.
His acting was brilliant. Too bad that its wasted on a movie like this.<br /><br />This film is one piece of a joke. A complete mishmash of wannabe cool
action scenes and heroes (and heroines), all lifted from different
famous foreign action movies. Awfully uninspiring, terribly
melodramatic and overdone, with a clich&#xE9; and unoriginal screenplay (See
PAPRIKA). The cast is just one bunch of poseurs. At times I was really
wondering what the director was thinking while copying some of the most
famous scenes of Hindi films. The final scene is simply pathetic, and
so is this film. Don&#x27;t go anywhere near a theatre playing this flick.
Its awful.<br /><br />I&#x27;d advise you to wait for the DVD to come out. Don&#x27;t buy it. Just rent
it... and then just return it! Avoid this dreadful cheapo Paprika
ripoff at any cost.<br /><br />Entertaining for a dull Sunday afternoon/ Nothing new
