At the end of the movie I was really surprised that someone actually
stole the whole plot from &#x22;Paprika&#x22;, an anime released in 2006.<br /><br />Nolan shamelessly took story, characters and even scenes from Paprika -
which goes way beyond &#x22;inspiration&#x22;. Go search for Paprika on the net
for yourself.<br /><br />For the dialogues and directing: The first hour was just awful. That
old shoe Leonardo and some other soulless characters talking and
talking and talking. I just wanted to stand up and shout: SHUT UP AND
GIMME A REASON TO WATCH!<br /><br />And after noticing the whole idea was stolen, I really had a hard time
not to leave. But I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Nothing changed, three scenes switching all the time: falling car, dude
fighting in hotel, a group of Chuck Norrisses fighting in snow. And
that for an hour. Whee whee special effects! OK, but special effects
should be the cherry on the delicious ice cream, not the ice cream
itself.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Unless you are into
quickly changing scenes and super-mystical-pseudo-deepness with a
bullshit ending (which are a lot of people).
