Life&#x27;s a never ending maze - updating rating to 10/10 - due to reasons
below<br /><br />The hype was true, like many ppl i wondered many vry gud reviews were
received from friends.. There might be many reasons but i discovered my
reason for praise:<br /><br />Long time back i came across a review titled the movie would become
religion!! Well i feel kinda same now as each time i go to bed i wonder
upon what was told. I could say it&#x27;s very similar to the matrix in
concept but it&#x27;s a hell new creation and v affecting perspective
right!!<br /><br />Here&#x27;s what it made me come up with minutes back n making me update my
rating to 10!! i am not made mad by any movie.. It&#x27;s like this one is
volunteeringly unforgettable till now!! Influential... Personally
strange too!!<br /><br />My lines- Friends any one o you remember where and what we were doing
before our first memories... We all are getting fooled since childhood
guys! It&#x27;s all a dream but which we call reality... So our usual dreams
are dreams in dreams right? Gosh now i know how the story came into
place... It was a planted idea by someone with the story and script n
architecture; so is all what we know and believe!! All planted into us
including the planting and growing trees part. So that&#x27;s Inception 2 ie
plant inside a plant...<br /><br />That&#x27;s a token of madness added ideas from the movie, who those seen
the movie might empathize with me : D<br /><br />Life&#x27;s a never ending maze Pmontu&#x27;s Projection signing off Have a gud
day everyone.
