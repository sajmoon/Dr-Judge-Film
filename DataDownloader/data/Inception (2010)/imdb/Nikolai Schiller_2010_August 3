Inception Review: The film was perfectly made and every single part of
it was amazing. This could definitely beat out Avatar, and I say this
because people are actually talking about how Inception really ended.
Although, I can&#x27;t tell you anything. But if a movie can get people
talking like that, then everyone will want to know about it and see it.
Not only that, it had epic action with awesome mind-twisting effects.
Inception is definitely the film of the summer and highly recommend it.
I definitely expect this movie to show its face at the Oscars and I
loved it. See my Toy Story 3 review. Inception is a must-see and a
definite classic four hundred years later.
