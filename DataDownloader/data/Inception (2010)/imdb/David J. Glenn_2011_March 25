I&#x27;ve watched this movie three times now, so i thought i&#x27;d share my
opinion on it. Inception is one of those movies where you must keep
your mind racing to piece together the mystery. There are mind boggling
twists in here, one or two predictable ones, but others that no one
seen coming.<br /><br />The movie really pulls you into it, because if you slack of for five
seconds you&#x27;ll miss an important piece of this story. The complaint
about it being too long is irrelevant, because there is not one second
wasted. Movies like 300 and Avatar are long, and have plenty of wasted
time. So it&#x27;s an understandable complaint, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in this
situation.<br /><br />The acting in this is great, but not very important. The only character
that has depth in this film is Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his
performance was amazing.<br /><br />Out of the many movies i&#x27;ve seen, i&#x27;d say this is easily top ten
favorites, top five as of now. It&#x27;s a movie you can watch several times
and always notice something new, something that you&#x27;ve missed the
previous times watching.<br /><br />If you watch movies to just sit back, and relax, than this movie will
probably annoy you. It takes some serious thinking to keep up and
understand what&#x27;s going on.<br /><br />I found zero flaws in this movie, which is rare. And if you did watch
this, and enjoy this a lot than check out some of Christopher Nolans
other work such as Momento, and The Prestige because those are films
that have the same mystery feeling, and takes thinking, and focus to
keep up and understand the film.<br /><br />To some things up, if someone asked me to describe the movie in one
word, i&#x27;d have to say &#x22;Original&#x22;, because it takes unused elements and
scenarios, and gives us a breath of fresh air.
