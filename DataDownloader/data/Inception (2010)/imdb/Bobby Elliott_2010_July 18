It should be called &#x22;Deception&#x22;. Or &#x22;James Bond Meets The Matrix&#x22;. Take
the worst bits of James Bond and the worst bits of The Matrix movies,
randomly mix them together, and you have &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />It&#x27;s pretentious nonsense from start to finish. The characters are
caricatures, the acting is formulaic, and the plot! Jeez. It starts
badly and gets worse. By the end, even the director couldn&#x27;t be
bothered and lets it degenerate into a standard James Bond movie
(complete with men in snow suits fighting on skis).<br /><br />The age rating (12A in the UK) means the ideal demographic for this
movie (8 year-old boys) can&#x27;t see it. This film is so bad, it creeps
into classic-bad-movie territory. Oh, by the way, I &#x22;get it&#x22;. I just
don&#x27;t &#x22;like it&#x22;. And the movie is not existentialist. It&#x27;s pointless.<br /><br />I like to say something positive about every movie I see but I am
struggling with this one. Oh, I have something: it has a great ending -
because it ends.
