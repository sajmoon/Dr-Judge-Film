&#x22;The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk
above water.&#x22; -Sigmund Freud <br /><br />Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22; plays very much like its subject matter
described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will
quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the
brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece lies
in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend
what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for
one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to
tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.<br /><br />It isn&#x27;t easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because
they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the
elements in &#x22;Inception&#x22;, but in order for one to understand what dreams
really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the
conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality.
Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the
iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the
preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were
the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state
between the conscious and the unconscious mind.<br /><br />It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where
a thief enters a person&#x27;s mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This
process he terms &#x22;extraction&#x22;, done by a team of people who design the
architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject
into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to
steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief
of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time
right-hand man Arthur.<br /><br />But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe)
wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival&#x27;s
(Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing
father&#x27;s business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this
dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito
promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb&#x27;s slate clean so he
is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb
begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the
forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of
it like a heist, only much more complicated.<br /><br />As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for
their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his
audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even
when you&#x27;re in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your
dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil
the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such
rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some
experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly,
but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and
regulations behind Nolan&#x27;s world- hence the multiple viewings.<br /><br />Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All
this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage
for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set
within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan
uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut
several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within
the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a
high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in
their own right, but with Nolan&#x27;s vision, Wally Pfister&#x27;s expansive
photography and Lee Smith&#x27;s fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of
these set-pieces is utterly riveting.<br /><br />Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments
courtesy of Cobb&#x27;s troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion
Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing
from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We&#x27;re kept in the
dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb
is unable to eradicate, but Nolan&#x27;s reveal towards the end of the film
that puts into perspective Cobb&#x27;s unresolved guilt delivers an
emotional finish that will leave you floored.<br /><br />As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors
who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio&#x27;s role
here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there&#x27;s
no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated
performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the
supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph
Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays
suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both
sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking
performance.<br /><br />But &#x22;Inception&#x22; is Nolan&#x27;s vision through and through- and in fact, a
visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan
spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and
complexity that makes &#x22;Inception&#x22; both an intellectual and visceral
enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which
have a special significance. With &#x22;Inception&#x22;, Nolan invites you to
open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities,
of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most
importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film
that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you&#x27;ll
want to experience it again immediately after you&#x27;ve seen it- just so
you can fully appreciate its genius.
