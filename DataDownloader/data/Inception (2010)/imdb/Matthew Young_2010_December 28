Cobb, an operative trained in the art of manipulating the dreamland, is
hired for a particularly difficult job involving Inception, implanting
an idea into someone&#x27;s mind, which many believe to be impossible.<br /><br />When I first saw Inception I looked at it all wrong. I was focusing on
the all of it&#x27;s flaws while ignoring all of it&#x27;s many gifts. Yes, many
of the ideas in Inception don&#x27;t make strict logical sense and some of
the characters we&#x27;ve seen before but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Some movies if
you just check logic at the door you are in for the ride of the your
life and this is one of the those movies.<br /><br />The concept of infiltrating the dreamland and stealing information like
some of sort of demented bank job is such a great idea with so many
cinematic implications that it&#x27;s a crime to just disregard it because
is &#x22;doesn&#x27;t make sense.&#x22; Movies are meant to tell you an amazing story
and let you escape the world for a while and Inception has that in
spades. No other director is currently pushes the bounds of film like
Christopher Nolan. He is a true visionary and I think many people are
quick to discard him and say he is overrated. Whether you think he is
overrated or not; he is consistently created original movie concepts
and that&#x27;s a very hard thing to do these days. Nolan also refused to
shoot Inception in 3D as well; which I admire because that has quickly
become Hollywood&#x27;s go to big bucks gimmick.<br /><br />In Inception, Nolan creates not only some of the best action scenes in
recent history but some of the best all time. The way Nolan is able to
weave a dream within a dream within a dream into a coherent scene is
truly a wonder. It&#x27;s mental Olympics just to keep up with all these
narrative strands at one time but it&#x27;s also a blast trying to solve
this mind puzzle that flies at you at 100 miles per hour.<br /><br />Inception isn&#x27;t just strictly meaningless fun however. Inception deals
deeply with memories and dreams and specifically how they can affect
and warp the mind. The idea of functioning in a word where bad memories
can come back to haunt you in a physical form is at once cinematic
excellence and a Freudian psychological study.<br /><br />Inception is not only the best movie of 2010 but a cinematic adventure
to rival Raiders of the Lost Ark. <br /><br />If Inception is a dream...I don&#x27;t want to wake up.
