Christopher Nolan&#x27;s newest mind game, turned blockbuster, turned
art-house shows that Nolan is the real deal. A master at his craft and
a firecracker of a writer. Here&#x27;s a story so deep, emotional and down
right confusing, for me to reveal any or most of the tricks would
simply baffle me and confuse you. Nolan&#x27;s cerebral outing is compelling
and visually challenging than anything out in the last several years.
His ability to construct this world with as much depth and passion
still play to the highly entertaining crowd as a Blockbuster hidden in
the rough is remarkable. A captivating film, with wonderful and careful
cinematography and cast, designed for their talent and not a
distraction.
