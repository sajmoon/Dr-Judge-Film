This movie is so hard to describe because the idea of this movie is
something you have to see for yourself. I just got done watching this
film 15 minutes ago and was I ever so shocked. The most I can share
with whoever reads this review is that the majority of the audience
shared a twist that was beyond Shutter Island. Christopher Nolan
delivers a grand scale complicated but satisfying film with such
emotional drive that it even had the attention of women who just want a
quick fix film that will satiate. And again I cannot stress enough how
AWESOME this movie is. This is a movie you&#x27;ll want to see as a midnight
screening in IMAX. What&#x27;s even better is that it doesn&#x27;t need the
technology of 3D to deliver, like Avatar (No offense James Cameron). AS
SOON AS YOU READ THIS GET YOUR LITTLE BUTT OUT OF THAT CHAIR, TURN OFF
YOUR COMPUTER, OR IPAD, OR WHATEVER, AND GO WATCH INCEPTION!!!!!!!
