I had high expectations for this movie and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. In
fact, it far exceeded them.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie is you can watch it ten times and find
out new information or discover new twists or ideas throughout the
entire movie. Christopher Nolan is definitely brilliant and it shows
through in this movie. The entire cast did a fantastic job including
Joseph Gordon-Levitt who I was disappointed with in G.I. Joe: The Rise
of Cobra. The special effects were incredible, the story (which I am
not talking about because I don&#x27;t want to give anything away) was
amazing, and the acting was extremely believable.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you have seen Inception there is a fantastic blog you can visit to
talk about it called: www.inceptionmovieforum.blogspot.com
