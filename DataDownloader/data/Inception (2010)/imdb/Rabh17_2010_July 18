I&#x27;ve heard this movie described as like &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; It&#x27;s Not.<br /><br />It&#x27;s totally different.<br /><br />I saw this in the Union Square Regal Theatre on Saturday right after it
opened on Friday. The Theatre was PACKED. And AMAZINGLY-- No-One went
to the Bathroom during a 2 Hour plus movie. No-one went for drinks.
No-one Went for Snacks. I didn&#x27;t hear ONE cell-phone yap. And I saw no
flickering screens of bored people texting their friends. That&#x27;s
testament in and of itself.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a Corporate Espionage thriller that goes inside the Dreams of the
Mind where Memories Hold Secrets. And the director does NOT throw any
horror clich&#xE9;s at you. He stays FOCUSED on the story and FOCUSED on the
Plot which is the &#x22;Completion of the Job&#x22; You won&#x27;t go to sleep here.
There&#x27;s action galore and the Visuals move crisply and are stunning.
But be warned-- near the end of the Movie-- things WILL get VERY
complicated-- and you will have to remember things and scenes that you
saw in the Beginning and Keep everything in Order.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t WAIT for this to come out on DVD!
