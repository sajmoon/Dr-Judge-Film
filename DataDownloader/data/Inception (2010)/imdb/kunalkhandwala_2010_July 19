With &#x27;Memento&#x27;, he bent minds with intricacies, with &#x27;The Prestige&#x27;, he
showcased his consistency with finesse and intellect, with &#x27;Batman
Begins&#x27;, he re-introduced a Hero from dark ravines, with &#x27;The Dark
Knight&#x27;, he made iconic history in evil&#x27;s greatest form and now; with
&#x27;Inception&#x27;, he not only affirms his distinction as the most innovative
and compelling film maker of our time but also epitomizes the best of
Hollywood&#x27;s intellectual, visual, graphic, technical, artistic and
performing capabilities. His work is by no means inspiring because you
simply cannot align your intellect with his imagination. &#x27;Inception&#x27;
perplexes on two main fronts: First, its mind twisting plot that
challenges you through a maze of incredulous events and Second, the
ability of the film to visually delineate all the endless possibilities
of Nolan&#x27;s intricately crafted dream world. &#x22;No way!... did they really
show a train going through streets of Los Angeles??&#x22; <br /><br />Nolan assumes that you&#x27;ve come prepared so without even saying
&#x27;Ready?&#x27;, the film takes off into the subconscious minds of Cobb
(Leonardo DiCaprio) who, being a professional &#x27;extractor&#x27; of the
secrets hidden in the subconscious, is up to an almost impossible task
that is rendered to him in-spite of a failed attempt on Saito (Kate
Watanabe). Cobb assembles his team of an architect (Ellen Page), a
scientist (Dileep Rao), an impersonator (Tom Hardy) and his trusted
compatriot (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). The mission impossible is to
execute the opposite of what they&#x27;ve been doing. Instead of extraction,
Saito requires Cobb&#x27;s team to implant an idea deep into the
subconscious mind of an industrialist heir (Cillian Murphy) that would
take effect in the future. This idea of &#x27;Inception&#x27; itself will sizzle
millions of brain cells and its elaborate execution through multi
layers of dreams is what the movie is about. <br /><br />Similar in manner to &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27;, our protagonist has a tragic
past that haunts his present and this backstory not only submerges you
into the emotional realm of its characters but also serves as the most
logic defying sequences in cinema. &#x22;Dreams are only real when we&#x27;re in
them. It&#x27;s only when we wake up that we realize that something&#x27;s
strange&#x22; is more than just a thought provoking dialogue..... <br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; demands real attention and rewards it in the end by
engaging the intellect while constantly mesmerizing the viewer with
stunning, jaw dropping constructs of a realistic dream world. The
film&#x27;s journey can thus be enjoyed at superficial levels as well as at
great depth. It is then left to you to notice the smallest detail
depicted on screen and go deeper through another layer of its
magnificent canvas in prolonged discussions and after-thoughts. The
film&#x27;s paradoxical, intricately tangled nature is further complemented
by its most &#x27;human&#x27; side of a father wanting to return home to see his
kids and rid himself of the past that haunts him. Cobb&#x27;s journey home
is the motivation for you to sit at the edge of the seat as they all
get &#x27;kicked&#x27; out of their dreams. While the science behind the movie&#x27;s
concept involves paradoxes such as Mobius strips, Escher&#x27;s stairs, The
Matrix and virtual reality, it does not neglect the most challenging of
human struggles that Cobb finds himself with &#x96; to let go and move on. <br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an exemplary performance with the commitment
and understanding of his character that rich and deep. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt is awesome in the weightless action sequences and his
performance desires more of him to be seen in the future. Tom Hardy as
Eames provides the comic relief supported by Dileep Rao. Cillian
Murphy, who played Batman&#x27;s Scarecrow is also brilliant as Fischer. Ken
Watanabe, also a villain in &#x27;Batman Begins&#x27; is the most impressive of
the supporting cast as Saito. Critically acclaimed Michael Caine has a
smaller role which he enriches with his charming presence and Ellen
Page (&#x27;Juno&#x27;) is impressive as she supports DiCaprio in most sequences. <br /><br />Hans Zimmer&#x27;s musical score is remarkable in many ways. Not only does
it set the right mood for the film but it also complements some
bewildering scenes which would seem cartoonish were it not for such an
intense score. Technically too, &#x27;Inception&#x27; is a landmark film. The
dazzling sets, stunning cinematography of locations across the globe,
live action car chases, Mombosa&#x27;s street chases, folding streets,
missing reflections in giant mirrors, elaborate explosions in Parisian
markets, the intense action in the Hotel corridors, the extremely
slowed down visual of the falling van and the swift constructs that
appear during Ariadne&#x27;s training on the streets are all jaw dropping
elements of the film&#x27;s incredible ability to portray the director&#x27;s
vision of realistic dreams. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan will be heralded as the only film maker who could
give the biggest of hypes, an intellectual clobbering and still wow his
fans who come prepared to decipher his convoluted stories. The film is
paced well enough to grasp its intricate structure and it&#x27;s also high
on the entertainment factor. Nolan&#x27;s idea, much like the film&#x27;s concept
is complex enough to challenge the brain but has a credible notion to
it that is well understood by its cast/characters. Few films encourage
the audience to applaud in the end but only &#x27;Inception&#x27; will tempt you
to go back and watch it. Not because it was too complicated to decipher
but because it was so much Fun.....<br /><br />9.721 on a scale of 1-10.
