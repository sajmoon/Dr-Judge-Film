Dear Mr. Nolan,<br /><br />Despite your viral marketing campaign, you are not a genius and your
movie isn&#x27;t &#x22;insanely brilliant&#x22;.<br /><br />According to your ad campaign, what you aimed for is a multi-layered
movie where dream and reality intermix. In a sense, you got this right:
you really did mix the two up.<br /><br />A dream, you see, is an experience where rules are quirky and change
according to whims. Here&#x27;s an example: &#x22;When you get killed in a dream
you wake up. No, wait. When you get killed in a dream you go into limbo
and your brain turns into scrambled eggs. No, wait. Your brain turns
into scrambled eggs, but then it rights itself back when you wake up.
Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t and you kill yourself. Or maybe limbo is just like
any other dream sequence in the movie, so it&#x27;s awfully hard to tell.
Oh, never-mind. We&#x27;ll just go with whatever is most convenient at the
time.&#x22;<br /><br />Reality, on the other hand, is where rules are rigid and are known to
all. Examples are &#x22;2 minutes here are equivalent to 20 minutes there&#x22;,
&#x22;when you get wet here it rains there&#x22;, &#x22;when you fall here there&#x27;s no
gravity there (but, oddly, there is gravity one layer down)&#x22;. Clearly,
in your film, the two intermix. Consider the following dialog:<br /><br />&#x22;We have to get there in 16 minutes.&#x22; &#x22;But it was designed to take an
hour to get there!&#x22; &#x22;You must find a more direct route.&#x22;<br /><br />You&#x27;re in a dream for crying out loud! What&#x27;s to stop you from being
there *right now*? An &#x22;Ascending and Descending&#x22; staircase, stolen
shamelessly from Escher in lieu of any original idea (and, perhaps,
because it films really easily using forced perspective) -- *that*
works, but a *shortcut* contradicts the laws of physics?<br /><br />What this movie desperately needed is a bit of &#x22;Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind&#x22; (or one of the many other films that got dreams right).
You&#x27;re working in the medium where it&#x27;s easiest to achieve the dream
effect: the cinematic experience allows you to put whatever you want on
screen and any visual can be infused with emotion by use of music.
(Hint: not Hans Zimmer&#x27;s overbearing overtures.)<br /><br />Another trademark of dreams is imagination. Now, explain to me what all
the guys with guns are doing there. Why should a person &#x22;arm his mind&#x22;
with a militia? One of your characters says &#x22;Dream big!&#x22; and hoists a
grenade launcher. That&#x27;s not dreaming big. Here is a list of other
armaments, taken directly from the current box office tops: an ogre, a
dragon, a predatory alien, a sorcerer. Need I go on? You were doing
well there, for a moment, with the freight train, but it turned out to
drive aimlessly and disappeared from the film with nothing further.
Much the same can be said for the militia. How can we possibly care
about the plot or the characters when most of the time they are
attacked by gun-toting, faceless, aimless men, with no strategy or
goals, that appear at random simply for the sake of action? Then there
is &#x22;multi-layered&#x22;. Here, it just means &#x22;complicated&#x22;, not
&#x22;intelligent&#x22;. A small sample of suspense-of-disbelief shatterers: 1.
Dreams in dreams in dreams are just dreams. What &#x22;inner-ear&#x22; does a
dream figment have, to wake him up when he falls? 2. If the reflex of
waking up is caused from a sensation of free falling then, surprise, in
zero gravity everyone should wake up. 3. For the same reason, people in
the van should wake up when the van leaves the bridge and attains free
fall, not when it hits the water. 4. And, for the sake of argument,
let&#x27;s assume that the subconscious mind works 20 times faster than the
conscious mind. What, pray tell, causes the &#x22;compounded effect&#x22;? A
dream in a dream is just a product of the subconscious mind, not a
method for lightning-speed thought processes. 5. And these totems &#x96; how
exactly do they work? People can&#x27;t dream up toppling spinning-tops? (A
totem &#x22;litmus test&#x22; that Dom happily explains to everyone.) They can
steal passports, but not loaded dice? Come on. 6. Oh, and, best of all:
they can break into people&#x27;s minds but can&#x27;t persuade a customs
official to issue a visa?<br /><br />You can&#x27;t market your movie as intelligent, and then insult viewers
with such lenient physics.<br /><br />(And for heaven&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t bring Michael Caine in to play a 1D
character with two lines of script. That&#x27;s just embarrassing.)<br /><br />And now, to close off, the final scene.<br /><br />This last shot, ostensibly stamping the &#x27;masterpiece&#x27; seal on the whole
film, is really its most expected part. It&#x27;s a problem when your
audience is consistently ahead of you. (Big revelations like &#x22;That&#x27;s
how I knew inception was possible&#x22; gave me a feeling of &#x22;Didn&#x27;t we
already know this half an hour ago?&#x22;) If you asked audience members
five minutes into the film, 90% would have guessed the ending.<br /><br />And it&#x27;s not even a good ending: why not go for a last shot like the
one you used in &#x22;Memento&#x22;, which spelled out to the audience that we
all live within the confines of our own minds and can never truly
separate memory from fantasy? All you had to do was to flash back to a
sequence we know to be a dream, and to have the spinning top topple
there. The movie already contains contradicting flashbacks (e.g. Dom
and Mal seen alternately young and old at the end of their stay in
limbo). Why not that? Instead of telling the audience that Dom may
still be dreaming, say that nobody ever knows.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Mr. Nolan. I don&#x27;t think your film is bad. It&#x27;s
worse than that: it&#x27;s average. It&#x27;s a run-of-the-mill, big-budget,
Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster. And I was left bored.
