Inception is the new sci-fi movie that has taken America and Britain by
storm. In the US alone on it&#x27;s first weekend of release, it engrossed a
staggering $60.4 million dollars and is currently top of the box office
around the world. This movie has been hyped up beyond anything I have
ever known in magnitude. Plenty of friends I know in America informed
me of the same adjectives used to describe this movie &#x22;incredible&#x22;
&#x22;unbelivable&#x22; &#x22;terrfic&#x22; and common phrases associated with it like
&#x22;Christopher Nolan is a god film-maker&#x22; and with the film in general
&#x22;the best film ever&#x22; etc. Usually I typically associate these
adjectives and &#x22;the best film ever&#x22; phrase with a lot of movies I have
had the pleasure of viewing over the years. But to describe it with the
adjectives listed above is an understatement. There are no words that
can reiterate how this film is. Just using all the adjectives to
describe something you like will have to do. Usually when a film like
Inception is hyped, I get swarmed along with it. You just cannot help
it, it&#x27;s like the institution of cinema has an overwhelming attraction
to you that you give in to see films like Inception. I would certainly
rate Inception in terms of how amazing it is up there with Titanic,
Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogies.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, I knew nothing of his work before he reinvigorated
the Batman franchise. With Batman Begins he did this very well but the
Dark Knight as those who will know have looked at my review on it, I
found it bitterly disappointing to say the least though I was the
minority in arguing this. But most directors have their successes and
failures and after Inception Nolan truly deserves to join the other
Hollywood King of directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielburg, Clint
Eastwood and Peter Jackson. This is Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece.<br /><br />To start the basic story is that Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCapario) a highly
skilled thief at extracting ideas from an individual&#x27;s subconscious
whilst they are dreaming is a fugitive after he lost everything he
loved and is given the chance to go back to his children if he pulls
off one last heist of implanting an idea in Robert Fischer&#x27;s mind
(Cillian Murphy) to bring down an empire run originally by his dad.
Cobb ensembles a team of experts, which includes an architect that
designs the world of the dream, Ariadne (Ellen Juno) and Arthur (Joseph
Gordon Levitt). The idea to bring the empire down is to pull off
Inception, a supposed impossible dream system, which involves creating
a dream within a dream within a dream, basically three dream layers,
which is impossible to maintain before the dreamer wakes up in real
state. Meanwhile a back story that does though come into conjunction
with the main plot later on is Cobb&#x27;s visions of seeing his wife Mal
(Marion Cotillard) where his memories of her interrupt the dream state. <br /><br />Watch as events unfold before you as from the first scene, this is
truly a movie you need both your eyes, ears and mind to see. It is
stunning visually as the idea of controlling one dreams with different
layout&#x27;s and shapes takes effect. Never has architecture seem so
fascinating. Watching it is like art, creative, textured and
multi-layered exactly like a dream. Trying to make your brain function
at trying to understand the complexity of the multi-layered dreams in
the story is simplified, but you have to pay attention. This film is
literally perfect. The acting from DiCaprio is brilliant and just like
the excellent Shutter Island, he deserves an Oscar nomination. Terrific
support comes from Murphy, Juno, Levitt and Cotillard who flex out
their roles and make the most of it. Sir Micheal Caine gives a superb
tiny cameo of only being on the screen for a few minutes.<br /><br />Nolan appreciates that story and character and plot development is as
important as visual style and action, with the action being plenty of
and choreographed incredibly making it terrifically exciting. Each
character has depth particularly Cobb and there are extremely inventive
camera shots and angles that Nolan uses with a gorgeous cinematography,
a stunning music score and a cracking ending that leaves you to draw
your own conclusions. It reminds me of Mulholland Drive with dreams and
reality.<br /><br />Nolan has created a movie that will have impact on every film maker to
come and Inception will become a classic. Film enthusiasts and critics
will be analysing this for years. Truly a remarkable and stupendous
achievement for Nolan who has come up with an original and refreshing
story idea. All film departments perform immaculately like a well oiled
machine and I wouldn&#x27;t bet for me on this being the best film of the
year for me. The 9.3 of the IMDb rating is well justified. It&#x27;s two and
half hours this film, but they fly by. One of the greatest and surely
iconic and influential film&#x27;s of our time in over a hundred years of
cinema. I can&#x27;t give it more praise than that except to say I loved
Inception!
