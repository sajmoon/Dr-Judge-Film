I truly cannot understand why anyone would call this a good film. Fancy
special effects, yeah, plenty many lots... but special effects do not
make a film. It also needs a storyline that doesn&#x27;t shoot in every
direction, left, right, backwards and forwards throughout the entire
film for lack of substance.<br /><br />OK, so the dude wants to plant an idea in someone&#x27;s brain. Got that
after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like
a storm in a teacup.<br /><br />Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by
means of expressions like &#x22;he&#x27;s pointing a gloombobber with spiral
condensing palchromium in my direction&#x22; but, being a talented writer,
he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single
sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that
from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential
nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a
while. &#x22;This can&#x27;t be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem,
we&#x27;ll do it in seven!&#x22; would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.<br /><br />I couldn&#x27;t follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was
one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of
a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every
two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone
unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.<br /><br />In conclusion I don&#x27;t see any point in watching Inception unless you&#x27;re
extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn&#x27;t give a
whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place.
