INCEPTION is a film in which you want to go in knowing nothing because
it&#x27;s best seen with no prior knowledge. So I&#x27;m just going to not say a
word about the plot and have the film unfold in front of you, sometimes
literally. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to explain what INCEPTION really is
because it&#x27;s damn packed with so many interesting ideas. Really, when
you come out of the theater, you&#x27;ll only think, &#x22;What did I just see?&#x22;
The film is filled with so much ambition and so many original ideas
that it captivates you. In fact, I think this is the fastest 150 minute
film I&#x27;ve ever seen because it felt like 80 minutes! I really wanted to
see more when the credits rolled.<br /><br />Unfortunately, INCEPTION isn&#x27;t a perfect film. It falls short on its
ambition. Some ideas weren&#x27;t as developed as I hope they would be and
others weren&#x27;t presented clear enough. In fact, it&#x27;s as if the
characters spoke in another type of jargon exclusively made for
psychologists pursuing in the career of dreams. Also, the story isn&#x27;t
all that special. Another common complaint you might hear about the
film is that the characters are flat. It&#x27;s true. The film presents us
with six or seven characters but does absolutely nothing with them.
Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character is the only character that&#x27;s fleshed out.
In some cases, I didn&#x27;t care for the characters when their lives were
at stake.<br /><br />Still, the performances by the ensemble cast are really good. I enjoyed
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy in their roles a lot. I
might not be the only person to notice this but I thought Leonardo
DiCaprio played the exact same character as he did in SHUTTER ISLAND. I
couldn&#x27;t get past Ken Watanabe&#x27;s thick accent. It was hard to
understand him in many of his scenes. Marion Cotillard did a great job,
though.<br /><br />The film is also visually intricate, if that makes sense and even that
description doesn&#x27;t give the film justice. Again, it&#x27;s really hard to
explain. The visual effects were really excellent along with the action
scenes but don&#x27;t expect this film to be filled with action. The
soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (AKA: One of the best composers ever) is
fantastic, much like Zimmer&#x27;s other soundtracks.<br /><br />Overall, INCEPTION is a flawed but seriously excellent film that
presents some very, very, very interesting ideas. It&#x27;s a wholly
original film, which is great considering the amount of remakes,
re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, etc. that we&#x27;ve gotten in the past
few years, let alone this year. The characters could have been fleshed
out a lot more. Still, I was absolutely engaged throughout by the
story, and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s ingenious script and direction just
sucks you in. This is the perfect cure for this year&#x27;s lackluster
summer.
