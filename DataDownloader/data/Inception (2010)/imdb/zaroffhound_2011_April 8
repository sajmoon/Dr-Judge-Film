Apologies if i stand whilst i speak of the Great Nolan, the altar is
full of knick-knacks, the floor is dusty.<br /><br />I am sure to feel different when i have viewed this spectacle for the
third time. As it is i felt no emotional engagement, no desire, no
trepidation given that all threats on view were &#x27;contrived&#x27; to be
dangerous and were not inherently forceful enough to ensure my
adrenalin peaked at any point by natural causes.<br /><br />In short, aside from my vague emotional criticism of something
&#x27;confined&#x27; by intellectual scripting, the whole does not carry the
impact of the individual moment. The sensation was of having watched a
two hour twenty minute trailer for a film.<br /><br />Clever, hence the 4 out of 10 marks. Lacking any sense of humour,
warmth or human flaw, the sheer contrivance makes me want to go back to
watching Batman kicking people about the place.<br /><br />Full of sound &#x26; no Freudian slippage, signifying misconstrued Jungian.<br /><br />And i apologise for the pretensions, unlike this movie, sorry, film.
