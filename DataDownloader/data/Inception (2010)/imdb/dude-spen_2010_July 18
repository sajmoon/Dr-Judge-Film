Inception is a movie that needs great attention while watching; just a
moment&#x27;s distraction can make it hard for you to understand what is
happening. But that is not a bad thing; the whole movie is like a
cubical structure with blocks being inserted every minute. If Nolan had
placed one block in a wrong way, the whole structure would have been
destroyed. But Christopher Nolan had succeeded here in creating that
structure with utmost seriousness and care. All the blocks are safe and
at the right place. Here is a movie, with mind-boggling story,
jaw-dropping visual effects, brilliance in stunt coordination and Nolan
with superb skills of making a film. At the end of the movie, we are in
a trance - wow - it has totally bowled us over and it is not the
actions or effects that make this movie great but the STORY. Nolan has
won again.<br /><br />There was a Dark Knight, a few years back and the brilliance with which
a batman movie was handled was greatly applauded and enjoyed. But
Inception is better and has come out with double the perfection of Dark
Knight. The idea for the latter is much greater. But with a great story
and weak script we would have been disappointed. But that does not
happen and the script is just awesome and must congratulate Nolan for
developing such a fine script.<br /><br />The story revolves around Cobb who is the greatest extractor ever and
to help him there is Arthur. They are literally thieves who steal ideas
from others when they are dreaming in sleep. Then they get an
assignment to do the exact opposite they are trained to do. This time
they have to plant an idea not steal it. If Cobb does so what he is
offered is what he wanted the most, to go back home to his country with
no charges against him. Watch the movie to know exactly what happens
and what it means to him to go back home.<br /><br />We have seen the skills of Nolan as a director in Memento, Insomnia,
Batman Begins and Dark Knight and he has gone several steps ahead in
Inception, creating an astounding movie. I think this is Nolan&#x27;s best
work to date. He has created here a masterpiece that should be watched
in the big screen only. He has easily converted a complex idea into a
great script and has transported it into the silver screen with
flawlessness.<br /><br />There is a scene in which Cobb, the character played by Di Caprio,
explains to the Ariadne, character played by Ellen Page on dreams and
creating dreams when she suddenly realizes that she is inside a dream
and everything explodes. The explosion is so slow and the scene gets us
a close up of Ariadne, showing her realizing that she is inside a
dream. In one word, I will say this scene is just brilliant. Then there
was the action scene in zero gravity by Gordon-Lewitt, another
wonderful piece of direction. The movie is about an idea and is full of
vivid ideas that keep the viewer so gripped into the movie. The idea
for this movie will be probably Nolan&#x27;s greatest idea for a movie.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio was good as Cobb and was the right choice. Ellen
Page and Marion Cotillard also provide stand-out performances. Joseph
Gordon-Lewitt as Arthur, the second-in-line to Cobb, has also given
commendable performance. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are good in their
respective role. Michael Caine was just a hype not needed at all. He
was just there for two scenes and I felt like he was cast just for
being in every Nolan film.<br /><br />Inception is a MUST-WATCH. It is so engrossing and interesting. Nolan
has created one of the finest screenplays. The highlight of the movie
is the well executed detailed script and Nolan&#x27;s excellence in crafting
a movie.<br /><br />~ dillitalkies.blogspot.com ~
