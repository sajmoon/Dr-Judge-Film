This has to be for me one of the biggest load of monkey crap i have
ever seen.i was bored throughout the whole movie.The best part was when
the credits rolled.I enjoy movies like time cop and total recall
etc,but i really couldn&#x27;t enjoy this no matter how much i tried to.I
don&#x27;t know how this got an 8/10 rating to be honest.If you are bored
and have nothing else to do,you will just be even more bored watching
this.I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in movies like Titanic,Catch me if you
can,The Beach etc.But this is one of his worst for me personally.I have
now wasted two and half hours of my life, which i will never get
back.Watching this movie makes me think comeback Steven Seagal all is
forgiven.I think i need to lie down after having watched this awful
film.I love films and have watched a lot over the years.And sometimes
if i like them i will watch them again,This i definitely wont be
watching again.I don&#x27;t drink,but this movie would drive you to it.
