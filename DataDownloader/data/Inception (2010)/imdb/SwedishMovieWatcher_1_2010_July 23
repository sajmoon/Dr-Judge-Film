Pretend that you today enter IMDb in your web-browser and gets to the
their top 250. If you&#x27;ve been there before, you&#x27;ll notice that a new
film has entered the list and is already ranked very high.<br /><br />Yes, I&#x27;m talking about Inception. After barely three days after the
premiere of the film, it&#x27;s already ranked up to #3 at IMDb&#x27;s top 250.
It comes like a shock because you&#x27;ve never heard of that movie and have
no idea what it&#x27;s about. That&#x27;s what happened to me, so I simply
decided the next day to go to the cinema and take a look at it. When I
entered the theater, I still had no idea what the movie was about.<br /><br />Because of the interesting and very special kind of movie this is, I&#x27;m
not going to tell you about the plot. I want you the experience this
movie the same way as I did. But no matter if you know the plot before
you watch this movie or if it comes as a surprise, this flick is far
inferior then what many say.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll describe the good for you first. Leonardo DiCaprio did an
excellent work as the main character (Cobb). I can&#x27;t imagine someone
else who would&#x27;ve done that role better. Most of the action scenes
contained some CGI but it never gets too much like in Avatar and most
of the special effects are OK even if they don&#x27;t stick out that much.
What&#x27;s interesting though is that with help of the story, this film can
have three action scenes at once and they all have some sort of
connection and you&#x27;ll never get confused about that.<br /><br />While there aren&#x27;t many flaws about this film, the positive parts from
it is a bit too weak for actually being called a masterpiece. This film
is far from perfect, even if it&#x27;s easily worth a look. The first
problem that many of you&#x27;ll notice is that the concept of the film gets
old after about two hours and by then, you simply think that you&#x27;ve
watched enough. Some of the action scenes are too long and the plot is
a bit advanced but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get hold of it anyway.<br /><br />Inception is interesting piece of film, while it&#x27;s negatives is simply
that it&#x27;s positives are too weak for being a masterpiece.
