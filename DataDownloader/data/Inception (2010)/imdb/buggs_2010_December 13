Many friends saw this movie and said to me that I MUST see it. So I
did, expecting some really intelligent thriller with twists and turns.
But it turned out to be just another simple story. At first, the story
seemed very original. Dream within a dream within a dream... OK we get
the idea. But after a while it became too easy to follow, even for a
5-year old. There&#x27;s nothing stimulating about it. Unlike the Matrix,
when I first saw that movie I was puzzled: What the hell is going on???
And it kept me guessing until the end. But with Inception, that
sentiment just didn&#x27;t happen, as much as I wanted to, so to give it the
proper credit. Oh well, as they say, don&#x27;t believe the hype. The movie
tries too hard to pretend it&#x27;s smart for smart people, but it&#x27;s far
from it. I give it though good comments for special effects and
originality of the stunts. In the end, I could classify it as a normal
action movie, to join the no-brainer ranks of Rambo, Terminator, etc.
