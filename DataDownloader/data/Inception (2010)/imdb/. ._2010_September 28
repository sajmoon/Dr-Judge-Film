Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of
extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious
during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb&#x27;s
rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new
world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international
fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being
offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life
back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of
the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off
the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If
they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful
planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that
seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have
seen coming. Now I just copied and pasted that i had no idea what was
going on in this movie. The film is very good looking. The reason I
said a let down is because i was expecting more since Christopher Nolan
made The Dark Knight and Batman Begins which are two of my favorite
movies ever. There is nothing that ever made me scared to go to sleep
or anything. It&#x27;s still one of the best movies of the year though
because let&#x27;s face it there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of good movies out this
year that are amazing like last year,like Avatar, Zombie Land, District
9, Up, and The Hurt Locker.The battle scenes were very impressive,
academy award winning acting, but nothing really clicked so i am giving
this an 8.5 and it&#x27;s still worth your money but it&#x27;s not an astounding
master piece like people say it is.
