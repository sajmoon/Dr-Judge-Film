A few months ago, when the trailer was published, we knew that Nolan
was on to something here! After those minutes, your heart was pounding,
your brain things were running from one way to another, if someone
would appear and say: &#x22;this is not going to be released&#x22; or something
like &#x22;Project discontinued&#x22; you&#x27;ll had a stroke!<br /><br />It was released! released in the beginning of the summer,announced as
Nolan&#x27;s Masterpiece.<br /><br />As a truly &#x22;Memento&#x22; ( Nolan ) admirer i admit that was a little bit
skeptic.Fortunatly, i was wrong!&#x22;Inception&#x22; is better than &#x22;Memento&#x22; as
&#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; is better that &#x22;Reservoir Dogs&#x22;, both amazing films but
shadowed by the respective followers. &#x22;Inception&#x22; as lots of special
things, moments, scenes, dialogs and characters that will stay with you
for a long time!You won&#x27;t forget the spinning gizmo, you won&#x27;t forget
Paris rising in front of your eyes; you won&#x27;t forget the building up
momentum between Leonardo Di Caprio and the beautiful Marie Coutillard,
there are lots of thing you won&#x27;t forget!<br /><br />As always Mr.Ebert is short and accurate. &#x22;Here is a movie immune to
spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that would tell you nothing unless
you knew how it got there. And telling you how it got there would
produce bafflement.&#x22; - Roger Ebert<br /><br />I won&#x27;t be describing the whole as that is not the point! The point is
to praise Chris Nolan for his achievement on being creative, being
bold, being courageous enough to create instead of remaking in a time
that Hollywood has reached to creation crisis,&#x22;writers menopause&#x22;.<br /><br />Nolan explains to us through Leo Di Caprio that we never know when
dreams begin, in the same way when watching &#x22;Inception&#x22; we never know
for certain where we are, we&#x27;re characters in the movie we also belong
in the movie, and that my dear Friend&#x27;s it&#x27;s pure brilliancy.<br /><br />I want so finish by stating that i&#x27;m a Nolan admirer, but i also
believe that he has this overrating effect on people: Dark Knight &#x26;
Inception are truly remarkable films in their own levels, but (for me)
their not as good as IMDb&#x27;s top 250 picture them.<br /><br />8.9 - Not reaching Muholland Drive &#x26; Donnie Darko however one of the
best Mindf*** films around!
