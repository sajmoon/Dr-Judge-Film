In my opinion, the definition of a film-masterpiece is one that has an
accessible but surprising plot that connects to a deeper rhetoric. The
acting is great, the movie is exciting and visually iconic.<br /><br />Inception, has most of these. But like many of Nolans films, the
narrative is a puzzle. A film with a difficult plot cannot be
traditionally called a masterpiece. This is why, we must change our
definitions to suit. &#x22;Inception&#x22; IS a masterpiece. It transcends the
world of cinema. It is a film like no other. It cannot be judged on the
same terms as any other...<br /><br />I won&#x27;t go into details but it involves an expert team traversing the
subconscious dreamworlds of others.<br /><br />Most of the fun (or frustration) comes from keeping up with the films
internal-logic.<br /><br />However, this movie is very clever. Real lucid dreams, like yours or
mine, have internal logic. The make sense at the time - &#x22;we only
realise we&#x27;re in a dream when we wake up.&#x22; It&#x27;s only in the real-world
we realise our dream doesn&#x27;t hold up to common-sense or scrutiny.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a stroke of genius that &#x22;Inception&#x22; parallels this. It&#x27;s own
internal logic is a joy to behold, a great journey to follow. But like
a lucid-dream, it&#x27;s own internal logic defies real-world logic.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re asking &#x22;how can this technology fit inside a suitcase?&#x22; then
you&#x27;re missing the point entirely.<br /><br />It operates on many levels. It&#x27;s a film that, as long as it&#x27;s
understood, will stay with you to the grave.
