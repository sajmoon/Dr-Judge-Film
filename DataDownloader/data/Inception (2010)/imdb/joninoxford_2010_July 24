I really wanted to like this morning but it was the first one since Mr
Magoo that I have felt like walking out of! I had a feeling of having
seen it all before during this movie - I was constantly thinking of
Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come where his wife is trapped in
purgatory and also Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. By the end we
were all waiting for it to end in my group and comments when filing out
of the cinema in Australia were much the same from the rest of the
crowd. It actually feels like a nightmare which I guess is what the
director intended. On the upside it had a fantastic all star cast but
they struggled to make this mess coherent. Cillian Murphy - still
waiting to hit the Hollywood big time he deserves - tried his best with
his limited script but he really needs a better part than this. The
music was quite jarring all the way through, and sounds near identical
to DiCaprio&#x27;s last movie; the much better Shutter Island. The constant
strings with trumpet bellows are meant to add tension, but after you
hear the same sequence of music for over two hours it gets a little
annoying to say the least. I am sorry; I wanted to love it but it ended
up being baffling by the plot and painfully boring to watch.
