Man, oh, man. I remember when this movie originally came out - It
basically made my summer. Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a movie
that needs little to no introduction. It&#x27;s a movie that took Nolan
somewhere around 30 years to fully create. As a result of this
preparation, &#x22;Inception&#x22; remains the most intelligent science fiction
film I&#x27;ve ever seen, and, not to mention, one of the greatest films
I&#x27;ve ever seen. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is as much of an sci-fi film as it is an
action, drama, or a mystery - it&#x27;s that multifaceted. The movie
features one of the most well thought out plots I&#x27;ve ever seen,
featuring an unforgettable cast of colorful characters that are
portrayed excellently by their respective actors. In a Technical
aspect. . .what can I say? &#x22;Inception&#x22; took home most of the technical
achievement Oscars at the Academy Awards this year. Another cool facet
of the film (one of my favorite aspects of the movie) is the iconic,
emotional, and kick-ass soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. This is one of those
movies that renews my faith in the movie industry, as a whole.
Spectacular.
