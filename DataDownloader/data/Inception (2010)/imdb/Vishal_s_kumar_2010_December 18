There is a small, militant camp of malcontents who despise everything
Christopher Nolan has ever committed to film, and their numbers only
seem to grow as countless critics and the movie-going masses at large
declare him to be one of modern cinema&#x27;s greatest visionaries. To them,
Nolan&#x27;s latest buzz-earner, Inception, is either a dull, confounding,
over-plotted misfire or a convoluted, self-important, superficial
brain-bender. I&#x27;ve long been one of the masses, willingly drinking more
and more of Nolan&#x27;s Kool Aid with each passing film. As far as I&#x27;m
concerned, Inception not only stands as the pinnacle of a master
filmmaker&#x27;s canon, but as a cerebral masterpiece in its own right; one
that&#x27;s far and away my favorite film of 2010, and a strong contender
for my favorite film of all time. Anyone who can pen a concise,
revealing, spoiler-free plot synopsis of Inception is a far better
writer than I. Hoping to implant an idea in the mind of a recently
deceased entrepreneur&#x27;s heir (Cillian Murphy), a rival businessman (Ken
Watanabe) hires a team of highly skilled thieves -- sullen team leader
Dominic Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon
Levitt), master forger Eames (Bronson&#x27;s Tom Hardy), dreamscape
architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) and chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) --
trained in invading other people&#x27;s dreams. But dream-diving isn&#x27;t an
easy task, especially when the goal is to plant an idea rather than
extracting information from the target&#x27;s conscious. Complications
abound of course: the creation of an elaborate array of dream worlds is
required to pull off the job, subconscious projections pose a serious
threat, and waking up isn&#x27;t always as simple as it sounds. Nor is
Nolan&#x27;s intricate film. Part heist flick, part densely plotted sci-fi
genre pic, part dramatic character study, part action thriller, part
cinematic enigma, Inception braves intertwining paths most films would
avoid altogether. And Nolan? The famed writer/director toys with
everything from perception to reality to time itself, all within the
span of two-and-a-half perfectly paced, magnificently constructed
hours. Even if you don&#x27;t enjoy Inception&#x27;s story as much as others,
it&#x27;s difficult to walk away without some appreciation for its balance,
artistry and spectacle.<br /><br />Imagine six of these equally complex lines laid out across one another,
arranged symmetrically, and then folded into a Rubix Cube of
interlocking twists and turns. Now imagine holding this bizarre little
puzzle box and being asked to solve its mysteries as it comes to life
in your hands. This, dear readers, is just a taste of what it&#x27;s like to
watch Inception for the first time. Plot points arrive in droves, rules
and exceptions to those rules are divulged in quick succession, and
psychological analyses come fast and often. All the while, an eclectic
ensemble of wounded protagonists, witty heroes and conflicting
interests threaten to muddy the waters, but are never given the chance
to do so. Nolan&#x27;s command of his cast is as commendable as his command
of his cameras, and their pitch-perfect performances are a testament to
his control of an increasingly unconventional production. It&#x27;s the
stuff of nonsensical nightmares and filmmaking failures. Yet Nolan
manages to maintain a focused narrative, ably develop his characters,
address any and every possible plot hole and deliver an incredibly
satisfying pay-off. <br /><br />And I have to say: for as many tales of woe that have been written
about viewers&#x27; first encounters with Inception, I didn&#x27;t have any
problem. I never felt lost or frustrated; I never felt out of my depth
or in need of some point-by-point map. (And that&#x27;s saying a lot
considering Nolan simultaneously juggles four time lines, four separate
dream levels and four prevailing story lines.) But I was also aware
that I wasn&#x27;t fully digesting every single detail that graced the
script and screen; I recognized how much more Nolan&#x27;s world had to
offer that my brain could absorb in one sitting. Was it overwhelming?
Yes, but not for the same reasons some outspoken critics have
described, and certainly not in a way that disappointed me in the
slightest. I felt such an emotional connection to the characters, such
an intense fascination with Cobb&#x27;s quest (both internal and external),
and such inexplicable awe at the sheer audacity on display that I
reacted accordingly. The hair on my arms and neck stood at attention.
Chills ran up and down my spine for the better part of two hours. The
film&#x27;s closing moments were as moving as any in recent memory. It&#x27;s
rare that a film so readily engages my intellect; even rarer that a
film elicits such a visceral response from my mind, heart and body.<br /><br />I could go on at length about Inception&#x27;s casting and performances, its
mind-blowing visual and practical effects, its beautiful cinematography
or inventive set pieces, the subtleties of its story and themes, its
intriguing realities and refined dream mechanics, the driving surge of
Hans Zimmer&#x27;s infectious score, the effortlessness with which Nolan
weaves exposition into the fabric of his tale, or the emotional
undercurrent that charges each scene. Oh, did I mention the many, many
ways in which key aspects of the film are left open to
thought-provoking interpretation? Be that as it may, Inception should
be experienced and savoured; describing anything other than the film&#x27;s
impact would only take away from the thrill of discovering it all for
yourself. If I could get away with writing, &#x22;you simply must see
Nolan&#x27;s latest tour de force&#x22; and nothing more, I would, just in the
hope that newcomers would watch the film with as clean a mental slate
as possible. So, for what it&#x27;s worth, &#x22;you must see Nolan&#x27;s latest tour
de force.&#x22; Not only is it an amazing, eye-popping technical achievement
-- the likes of which have to be seen to be believed -- the entire film
defies explanation and shatters expectations. My advice? Stop reading
reviews of the film and tackle it for yourself. The less you know about
Inception, the better.
