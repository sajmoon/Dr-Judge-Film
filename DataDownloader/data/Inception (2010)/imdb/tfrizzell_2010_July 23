One of the ultimate mind-twisters/mind-benders in cinematic history,
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a complete and total triumph of concept and creativity.
Corporate raider Leonardo DiCaprio is able, with the help of others, to
invade the subconscious of unaware persons in the hopes of stealing
invaluable business data for competitors. However, a new assignment
(via the mysterious Ken Watanabe) comes forth which calls for DiCaprio
to actually plant an idea into the would-be victim&#x27;s subconscious to
make it appear that individual came up with the concept originally
himself. In this circumstance the victim is Cillian Murphy (who is
haunted by his relationship, or lack thereof, with late father Pete
Postlethwaite) as DiCaprio and his team (led by Joseph Gordon-Levitt
and Ellen Page) attempt to perform what the movie makes appear to be
highly dangerous and nearly impossible to pull off successfully.
Subsequently, there are dilemmas aplenty with the most major one being
DiCaprio&#x27;s memories of late wife Marion Cotillard which seem to
constantly pop-up and consume his dream-time missions. Ultimately, the
film&#x27;s journey through the mind will subsequently be an excursion into
the human heart, spirit, and soul as well via dreams within dreams
within dreams (and possibly even more dreams within dreams). Just as
writer/director Christopher Nolan (I think arguably the finest
film-maker in the world today) paid homage to modern film noir
directors Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann with the stunning &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22; back in 2008, he does the same to more great movie men like
Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Terrence Malick,
and David Lynch with &#x22;Inception&#x22;. Shades of &#x22;2001: A Space Odyssey&#x22; are
the easiest and most apparent comparisons which can be ascertained as
Nolan does the near-impossible balancing act of keeping the audience at
an arm&#x27;s length while simultaneously pulling them into the story from
the outset and keeping us on the edges of our seats. Sure, the special
effects are monumental along with the technical aspects of set design,
editing, and cinematography, but these elements are not going to be the
reasons why &#x22;Inception&#x22; will have long-lasting staying power. The
points of directing, vision, and screen writing (along with vastly
under-rated performances from the aforementioned players all the way
down to character roles for Tom Berenger and Michael Caine) will
destine &#x22;Inception&#x22; to be one of those movies which will never lose its
luster or glitter. One of the finest films ever conceived. 5 stars out
of 5.
