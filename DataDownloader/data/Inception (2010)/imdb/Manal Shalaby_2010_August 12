Can anyone tell me please what this fuss is all about?!! After reading
the critics&#x27; reviews, I rushed to the movies promising myself an
unforgettable night, but after the almost two-and-half-hour view, I was
nothing but deeply disappointed!... Not because the movie is bad. Not
at all! It was my highly raised expectations that came down to nothing.
The idea? Nice, but not new! It was differently treated in dozens of
movies before. Treatment? Certainly interesting and catchy even though
I think it was pushed a little too far. Plot? Filled with holes that
can let a bus through. Direction? quite brilliant I have to admit,
Christopher Nolan did a great job here. He managed to turn this
could&#x27;ve-been-boring thriller into a dramatic action in which he keeps
in touch with the human side of the characters along the way. Another
reason behind the success of Inception is the outstanding cast.
Leonardo DiCaprio has completely departed from the sissy-like
performance of Jack Dawson and has grown into a full-fledged actor to
whom I respectfully raise my hat. Marion Cotillard was nothing but
truly amazing! Without her, the movie would&#x27;ve certainly flunked. Ken
Watanabe, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian
Murphy all did a great job as well. All I want to say here is that the
movie is surely enjoyable and worth the watch, just don&#x27;t expect to see
a phenomenon!
