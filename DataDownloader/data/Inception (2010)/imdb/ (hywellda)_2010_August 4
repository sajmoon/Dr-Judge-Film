First, let me say that ALL the Actors, but one, were fantastic, and the
one that wasn&#x27;t, had a language/enunciation problem. (half the time he
spoke you couldn&#x27;t understand what he said) <br /><br />But good actors (and believe me they did their damnedest!)can&#x27;t make up
for a wandering script with poor suspension of disbelief. <br /><br />Just when something needed expounding or explanation, the script would
jump to a different scenario. <br /><br />And the sound! <br /><br />I guess the editor thinks that when you push the volume, no-one will
notice how the villains (the &#x22;projections&#x22;) have no identity
(individually OR in groups) for the audience to hate (OR love.) <br /><br />So loud during the bombings and shoot-&#x27;em-ups, I had to plug in my ear-
buds. <br /><br />This movie could have been the best of the year with INTELLIGENT
rewriting, editing, and minus the actor with questionable language
skills. <br /><br />Instead, it was nonsense. <br /><br />I can not believe IMDb&#x27;s 9.2/10 rating. I smell a rat. I guess if
Congressmen and Senators take bribes, why not IMDb &#x22;payola&#x22;!
