Not too sure what all the fuss is about Nolan has directed far better
movies.<br /><br />How this can be rated in the top 10 of the &#x27;Top 250&#x27; index only
demonstrates the flaws of the IMDb rating system as much as it does to
the rationale behind general movie-goers.<br /><br />The idea of a dream within a dream, or lucid dreams, or memories, has
been touched on and seen in other films. Vanilla Sky is a perfect
example, which is actually a much better film overall. The acting is
more powerful and you begin to develop a strong connection with the
characters throughout the movie, unlike in Inception which is rather
more focused on plot.<br /><br />Inception...well, I wish it really were a dream.
