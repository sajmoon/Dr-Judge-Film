A brilliant film, and Director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s best to date. Once
in a while a good original idea, an intelligent script, and a fine cast
come together. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is one of those occasions. Any story that
takes two and a half hours to tell on screen had better be good &#x96; and
this is. The basic premise is fairly straight forwards. A mind invasion
expert, Cobb, played by De Capprio, is hired to persuade the heir to a
global conglomerate to break up the Corporation by a business rival .In
return that rival promises that his influence will ensure that charges
against Cobb in the US will be dropped.<br /><br />The opening act is disorientating as reality and dream are introduced
to the viewer non-sequentially. Although the narrative does not
initially make sense, the action is compelling enough. Then slowly the
plot unfolds in a device that Nolan first explore in &#x22;Memento&#x22;.
Gradually the story makes sense via a young student, Ariadne, played by
Ellen Page, who is hired to assist in the project .Yet just as we are
getting to grips with a &#x22;mind theft&#x22; plot a parallel plot emerges. That
of Cobb&#x27;s deceased wife, and the part he had to play in her death.<br /><br />Essentially, Nolan is playing with a device popularised in
Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x22;Hamlet&#x22;. The play within the play, and he has a lot of
fun with it. The opportunity it presents for non-linear action and
narrative is exploited to the full, especially as he chooses to
introduce the concept of three levels of dreaming. As a consequence,
the viewer is forced to pay attention, simultaneously trying to make
sense of the on screen action whilst reflecting how action in our own
dreams works.<br /><br />There is little to find fault with. Pete Postlethwaite and Michael
Caine relish minor roles and Marion Cotillard exudes mystery and beauty
as Cobbs&#x27; wife. The myriad &#x22;dream within dream&#x22; sequences provide
multiple mini-action climaxes which do disrupt a conventional film
narrative, yet the ending is a good old fashioned device of keeping the
audience guessing.The handling of illusion and reality will delight
&#x22;Matrix&#x22; fans, whilst a shoot-out at a snowy mountain hideaway is pure
Bond circa &#x22;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&#x22;. So whilst Nolan explores
the cerebral dimensions of the plot in a way that would have delighted
Stanley Kubrik, he also relishes an action sequence as much as Jerry
Bruckheimer.<br /><br />Easily amongst the best films of the 21st Century and destined to be a
classic.
