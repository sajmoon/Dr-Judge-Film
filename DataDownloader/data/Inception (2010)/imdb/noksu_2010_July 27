The first thing to come in my mind about this movie is the Matrix. Same
kind of enigmatic feeling, original and fresh concept, being &#x22;jacked
in&#x22; to (without spoiling) another world, kick ass atmospheric
soundtrack. I have to say that the ambient music was spot on and
correlated well with the movie atmosphere. Great performances from each
cast member and especially DiCaprio which showed again that he&#x27;s more
than just a pretty face. I enjoyed the presence of Cillian Murphy (the
coolest baddie from Dark Knight). Plot was well written and far more
intelligent than average Hollywood blockbuster. Most of the time the
fiction sounded and felt very believable. Every aspect from the movie
was just very well executed. If something negative must be said the
action was a bit too tense and there wasn&#x27;t enough breathers. It
started to numb my mind at the end because action was too tightly
packed. Almost whole film is a one big action scene. But still, have to
give this 10/10 because this just is an epic movie. If you liked the
Matrix you will definitely like this too.
