The plot was unnecessarily drawn out and complex. My theory is that
everyone that sees it just says it is great because they want people to
think that they are intelligent. You may be intelligent, but if you
fall for it you are not. The director obviously figured out the human
psyche, knowing that people would say they liked it just because it is
complex and they want others to think they are smart. Well it is not
complex, they just made it ridiculous. It did not need to be so complex
to get the one point the whole 3 hours made. It was not suspenseful at
all. It might deserve a 3 or 4 but I give it a 1 for wasting my time
and to help drag down the undeserving 9/10 that it has. I just now saw
it because I didn&#x27;t fall for the previews, I just saw it was in the top
250 so I decided to give it a chance. This just reinforces how dumb
people are. The 10/10 ratings must have come from children and
cognitively deficient individuals. Don&#x27;t waste your time, and please
don&#x27;t buy or rent it. Download it off the internet, all you need is
BitTorrent (free program) and then search &#x22;Inception Torrent&#x22; on
google, the first hit is usually the file you need. You can burn it to
a DVD or watch it on your computer! Please god (imaginary, but a good
phrase) don&#x27;t pay to see it.
