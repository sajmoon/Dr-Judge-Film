Christopher Nolan&#x27;s sci-fi thriller might well have been called
&#x27;Deception&#x27;, or better still, &#x27;Multiple Deception&#x27;, such is the effect
the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does
borrow from classic American films such as &#x27;Citizen Kane&#x27; and &#x27;The
Matrix&#x27;.<br /><br />Many film geeks &#x96; and ordinary punters &#x96; have described this film as
&#x27;very complicated&#x27;. The truth is it&#x27;s just tremendously detailed. For
his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas
from people (&#x27;Extraction&#x27;); however, the film concerns itself with him
implanting an idea into a person&#x27;s mind, i.e. &#x27;Inception&#x27;. That&#x27;s the
plot in one crude line.<br /><br />However, to reduce the plot &#x96; which took a modern master nearly eight
years to flesh out &#x96; to one purely about mental thievery would be
unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.<br /><br />Business tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate
process of Inception on another businessman&#x27;s son, Robert Fischer
(Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father&#x27;s energy company from becoming
a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will
betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must
implant is for him to repudiate his father&#x27;s will.<br /><br />The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never
explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child&#x27;s
primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to
be the focus.<br /><br />For all its cerebral conceit, at the film&#x27;s core are two emotional
stories. One is of Cobb&#x27;s wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her
time stalking Cobb&#x27;s subconscious and thereby sabotaging his missions.
The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is
strained.<br /><br />We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &#x27;The Departed&#x27;. Here he
permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. However, while
the ensemble acting is good, most of the main characters seem far too
young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael
Caine&#x27;s turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.<br /><br />The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the
action scenes would be clich&#xE9;d if they were not embellished by Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s superbly suspenseful music.<br /><br />Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly.
Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost
interest somewhere in the second half.<br /><br />Within days of the film&#x27;s release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their
votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at
least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time.
So much for polls.
