OK, this film did have great effects. And it had potential to be a
great film. But sadly, it wasn&#x27;t. It took to long to get started. There
were some annoying dialogues. The effects are what kept me in the
cinema, but, great effects don&#x27;t make a great film.<br /><br />My friend and I nearly left the cinema, and at many times, a lot of
other people watching it were getting annoyed at how slow it really
was. I think the main thing that annoyed me was who they were actually
trying to &#x27;incept&#x27;. Just didn&#x27;t seem like a very important figure.
&#x27;Incepting&#x27; the president or someone like that could have been much
more entertaining:0<br /><br />Sorry Mr Nolan, but next time tell the story properly:) J
