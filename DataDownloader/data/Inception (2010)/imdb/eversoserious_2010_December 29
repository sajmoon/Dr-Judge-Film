As someone who has explored hypnotism in depth, the concepts behind
Inception were relatively easy to comprehend, and I enjoyed the novel
idea of dreams within dreams within dreams. But the plot does seem to
get caught up trying to be too clever with the prologue and epilogue,
and I would agree with some critics who accuse it of almost collapsing
in on itself. I think it just manages to keep interest, but that may be
solely because I have experienced very deep trances in hypnosis, and
understood the ideas suggested by the film.<br /><br />Visually the film uses rather interesting spectacle to show how dreams
may collapse in on themselves, and tries to keep you guessing as to who
is attempting what. It is, at times, stunning to watch. But overall the
film fails to develop an interesting idea to the maximum.<br /><br />The acting is reasonable rather than good.<br /><br />Not in the same league as Minority Support (for example) but reasonable
sci-fi.
