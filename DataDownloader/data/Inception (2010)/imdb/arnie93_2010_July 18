Inception by far the best by Christopher Nolan&#x27;s work. I watched the
with a mindset that I would not match Dark Knight but then again where
it was Heath Ledger who was the Hero from the movie Dark Knight. It was
Chris Nolan was stole the show in this one. Surely the best movie of
this year. A movie even when it ends it casts an impression in ones
mind, questioning ones belief in reality. This the movie that I wanna
own the Blueray disc of when it gets released in DVD. I would give it
9/10. And yes will surely watch it again in the theater the end of this
month, just so as to savor this brilliant masterpiece from the
revolutionary director Mr. Nolan.
