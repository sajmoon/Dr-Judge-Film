I am not able to go into full detail on a review for Inception as it is
1:30am but after seeing it I HAD to log in to mention a couple of
things that made this one of the best movies I have ever seen.
Originality. Something that is lacking far too much in Hollywood.
Between sequels and re-makes I cannot remember the last truly
&#x22;original&#x22; screenplay I have witnessed...maybe Memento! Cerebral. I
hate to sound snobbish and I do love mindless fun films as well, yet it
was so great to watch a movie that really made you think, and think
deeply. The Ending. What really happened there? Who Cares?! It is up to
the individual or group of friends to discuss. I love that. It really
doesn&#x27;t have a concrete answer. Good. The visuals. Not so much for the
city scenes you see in the previews but little things, such as a fight
scene with a hallway flipping around or a brief staircase paradox. I
actually enjoyed them more than anything from the Matrix. Maybe it was
that they were more subtle. The overall complexity was refreshing where
too many movies come out that spoon feed the audience. I have read many
reviews tonight and I am thoroughly enjoying reading everyone&#x27;s take on
the ending or the movie as a whole. Most people are writing short
novels with their own take on it. How many movies have done that
lately? I have to admit my favorite part was in the parking lot after
hearing the poor girl to her boyfriend conversation &#x22;I don&#x27;t understand
it&#x22; &#x22;Yeah, I didn&#x27;t think you would&#x22; ouch
