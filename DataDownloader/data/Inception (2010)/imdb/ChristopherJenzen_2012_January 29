Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero
problem with that,unless fans weren&#x27;t so extremely elitist and
condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited
vocabulary but maybe a good read?<br /><br />DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with
Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars
alongside him,he&#x27;s the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter
Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.<br /><br />If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and
Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect
actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues. <br /><br />Plotwise though,it&#x27;s all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to
create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main
characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a
business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is
the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new
concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope. <br /><br />Understand it could&#x27;ve been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next
day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still
it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human
heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and
his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.<br /><br />All scenes involving her are superb,it&#x27;s a nuanced performance worthy
of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and
Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is
great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who&#x27;s most alive and
complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.<br /><br />Several actors could just&#x27;ve switched names,their characters don&#x27;t have
personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules
for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what&#x27;s happening at the
moment, that&#x27;s it.<br /><br />When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay
matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception
twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as
sophisticated sociopaths al&#xE1; Red Eye then see him as a blank page.<br /><br />Inception&#x27;s the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally
confusing and complex,you do have to pay attention,complex does not
equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you&#x27;re not
allowed to break and examine. It&#x27;s only when it&#x27;s over you realize you
were standing still all along. <br /><br />You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you
think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your
mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing
something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.<br /><br />Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great.
Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work
here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I
dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film&#x27;s eye
candy,perfect surface. The inside...?<br /><br />1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and &#x22;violence&#x22; going on here,
considering everyone&#x27;s sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are
murdered. Would&#x27;ve been more intriguing with psychological tension
instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical
threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well. <br /><br />Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive
CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL
execution and just cements the surface statement. <br /><br />2. Limbo. Wouldn&#x27;t a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn&#x27;t
it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point
probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs. <br /><br />3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white
man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is
again pivotal. It&#x27;s getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are
worked out by now.<br /><br />4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface
reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic
pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then
genuinely clever. <br /><br />Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our
heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the
end credits rolled.<br /><br />He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or
should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking
mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to
funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So... <br /><br />No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The
usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol
in their mouth when the words&#x22;Smart,thought-provoking thriller&#x22; puts
Inception next door to them. <br /><br />The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing
neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a
classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and
ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with
15 seconds to go,smart lad. <br /><br />A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a
magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the
sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at
times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation. <br /><br />DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of
what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a
sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.<br /><br />The rest could&#x27;ve been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay
Lohan...<br /><br />Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and
posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad
one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.
