There are immeasurable deceptions of &#x22;Inception&#x22; which will make your
freaky-fried mind go haywire! Mind you, all done with cerebral
expertise by Director Christopher Nolan. His visual euphoric
masterpiece is one that requires your complete attention. And even if
you don&#x27;t fully digest Inception&#x27;s complex plot, and most viewers will
not even though they might think they have, the film is still far from
being a nightmare. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, a dream extractor
who specializes in stealing valuable secrets of the subconscious from
others during their dream state. Call him another Cobb who has had his
share of dreamy hits. OK, call that a corny-on-the-Cobb pun! There goes
another one! Anyways, Cobb takes on one last job from Saito, a
corporate honcho. However, this one is not to extract but to incept
(hence, movie title) an idea into corporate competitor heir Robert
Fisher&#x27;s mind for financial gain. To incept is a more cerebral
challenge than to extract, and Cobb has only attempted it once before
(which becomes a centerpiece of &#x22;Inception&#x22;), so therefore Cobb and his
dream team are up for a challenging mindful task. The Cobb Dream Team
consists of Arthur the dream Setup-man, Ariadne the dream Architect,
Eames the dream Forger, and Yusuf the dream I guess Forger #2. Cobb
does have some nightmares of his own he wants to extract due to the
dreamlike existence of his deceased wife Mal in his extraction and
inception jobs. That&#x27;s about it on providing you information on the
&#x22;Inception&#x22; plot line. Don&#x27;t want to spoil this dreamy movie for you.
DiCaprio was effective as Cobb even though it was a very similar
character as the one he recently played in &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;. The
supporting cast of &#x22;Inception&#x22; was to near perfection. Ellen Page keeps
on building an already stellar career with her portrayal of Ariadne the
Architect. Joseph Gordon Levitt as Arthur was steady and provided some
comical contributions to a heavy-hitter movie. Tom Hardy&#x27;s work as
Eames the Forger was the real deal. There was not one mal thing about
Marion Cotillard&#x27;s deep performance as Mal. Cilian Murphy as Fisher,
Ken Watanabe as Saito, and Tom Berenger as Fisher assistant Browning
also provided &#x22;Inception&#x22; some positive corporate-character thespian
contributions. But most of all, &#x22;Inception&#x22; was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
vision! His direction was a cinematic magnum opus! His screenplay was
an intense maze of cerebral challenges. He was the MVP of
&#x22;Inception&#x22;!!! And I hope that is the perception of the Academy and
therefore finally nominate him for a Best Director Oscar. The technical
Nolanders also deserve kudos! I am dreaming of Oscar nominations also
for Wally Pfister&#x27;s cinematography, Lee Smith&#x27;s editing, and Frank
Walsh &#x26; Co.&#x27;s art direction. But it is the Zimmerman himself, music
score maestro Hans Zimmer, that I think has the Oscar in the bag. His
pulsating score is a pivotal player throughout the entire film and I
just cannot envision a better score in any other movie this year! Even
though I slightly favor Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Memento&#x22; to &#x22;Inception&#x22;, this is still
worthy to be called another Nolan extraordinaire piece of work! Dream
on if you think &#x22;Inception&#x22; will not linger in your mind for days to
come! ***** Excellent
