Being the die hard fan of Nolan Movies, I went to see the first day
first show of Inception with huge expectations and I convinced my
friends too, to go for it who do not like mind freak movies. I was too
anxious for this movie that I feared at the last moment; no matter how
brilliant this movie would be, it would not meet my expectations but
the moment it started till the end i was that much glued that i hardly
noticed whether the movie is good or bad and that is the best quality
of this movie. Script, pace, direction, cinematography, performances
and above all the background music..Oh my God, this movie is a treat to
watch. English is my third language but every dialogue went straight to
my &#x22;subconcious&#x22; and that is the one quality why Nolan is so much
famous in Asian and Middle East community. Every person in the hall was
absorbed in the movie despite of its hard subject and mind boggling
facts. I can keep on praising this movie all night and this whole
credit goes to Nolan and it truly is his masterpiece. If in one line i
would describe Nolan&#x27;s work then it would be, &#x22;Nolan nailed it.&#x22; Go
watch it and see where Nolan&#x27;s dream take your dreams to. <br /><br />10/10
