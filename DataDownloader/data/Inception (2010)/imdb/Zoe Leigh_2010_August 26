I&#x27;d seen the trailer a couple of times before I watched the movie, and
I didn&#x27;t really expect much of it. &#x22;Just a movie about a guy who steels
secrets in people&#x27;s dreams.&#x22;, that&#x27;s what I thought. I was completely
wrong. I&#x27;ve seen quite a lot of movies in my 15 years of life, and this
one was the best of all of them.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a pretty long movie, two and a half hours, but you won&#x27;t be bored.
Not even for a second. In many movies the end it too short, the action
not enough (or too much) and the dialogues too long. This is not the
case in Inception. it has just the right amount of everything.
Christofer Nolan&#x27;s done an amazing job, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if
this movie would get one, if not multiple, Oscars.<br /><br />As soon as the movie starts, you&#x27;re in a different world. The acting of
Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe,
Cillian Murphy and Ellen Page, is great. Hats off for Ellen Page, whom
I&#x27;ve not heard much of since Juno.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur and Tom Hardy as Eames have an amusing
love-hate-minus-love-relationship, which provides at least half of the
fun of the movie. Even though the movie is full of suspension and
occasional drama, it&#x27;s funny, too! The discreet jokes don&#x27;t ruin the
on- the-edge-of-your-chair-feeling at all.<br /><br />The action is brilliant. The drama is tear-jerking (at some points).
The acting is fabulous. The plot is unique and absolutely
mind-boggling. All in all, the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />Watch it. Now.
