I need not brag much about His Highness Christopher Nolan any more.
Everybody knows he&#x27;s an out of the box genius. And if anyone has a
doubt, go watch Inception right this moment. Its meant to be watched at
least twice. The first time, it just gives you a glimpse of his work.
And when you watch it the next time, you can actually pause to
appreciate each and every minute detail of his Masterpiece. Meanwhile
you cannot ignore other significant stake holders of brilliance, Hans
Zimmer and Di Caprio. Now this is what you call Awesome Background
Score. I can bet hes given out his all. The last time i saw Di Caprio,
he was still a kid. And look, what that kid has grown to become: THE
Dom Cobb. Hats off for his on screen performance. In nutshell, i just
hope that Inception doesn&#x27;t become Nolan&#x27;s ONLY Masterpiece. The
Benchmark for a Perfect Blockbuster has just been raised ! Go figure
out for yourself....
