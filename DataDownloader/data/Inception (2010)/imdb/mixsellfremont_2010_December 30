Intriguing premise and interesting early scenes, but bored me to death
during the second half of the movie, which in essence was just a &#x22;C&#x22; or
&#x22;D&#x22; super-action movie which, &#x22;aww shucks,&#x22; just happens to take place
inside someone&#x27;s dream-world. <br /><br />Especially tiresome were the battles with endless ski-troopers inside
the subject&#x27;s &#x22;militarized mind.&#x22; Utterly pointless. I was so bored
that I didn&#x27;t even care to think about the movie&#x27;s completely
predictable attempt at a thought provoking twist. I just didn&#x27;t want to
waste a single second more of my time in the ironically unimaginative
mind of the movie&#x27;s creator.<br /><br />Very boring and anticlimactic. Not even worth the time spend watching
it IMO. The 5 stars are given largely for the initially interesting
cinematography
