Inception is a science fiction action film written and directed by
Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio in a lead role.<br /><br />The film is about Dom Cobb(Di Caprio), a thief who has the power to
enter into the dreams of others by thrusting himself into the
subconscious of his targets, thus obtaining information that otherwise
impossible to access. However, when an enemy(Saito) predicts Cobb&#x27;s
every move, Cobb and his team of specialists are forced to plant an
idea in a target&#x27;s subconscious. The title INCEPTION refers to planting
an idea rather than stealing one.<br /><br />Much of the film&#x27;s first part is spent illustrating how Dom&#x27;s job
works: how he extracts dreams and ideas from people&#x27;s heads, and what
exactly the process involves. You&#x27;re introduced to the concept of
multiple levels and layers within the subconscious.<br /><br />The team&#x27;s target for inception is Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy),
son of Saito&#x27;s late corporate rival Maurice Fischer (Pete
Postlethwaite). The idea is a complex emotional suggestion that will
ultimately lead Fischer to disband his father&#x27;s empire. To achieve
their goal, Cobb&#x27;s team will have to pass down through several levels,
each a dream within the last. Time slows down with each level, so that
five minutes of real time would appear as an hour in the first dream,
which feels like 10 hours in the next level, and so on.<br /><br />The team boards a Boeing 747 transporting Fischer, drug him without his
knowledge, and enter into a dream with him. They have help from Yusuf
(Dileep Rao), the chemist who developed the compounds specific to the
multi-level dream state they are attempting.<br /><br />Everyone wakes up successively through all the levels of dream, alive
and well. As per his deal with the powerful Saito, Cobb is given leeway
to re-enter the United States, and is reunited with his children. The
final shot shows his totem, spinning but beginning to wobble. The scene
then cuts to black.<br /><br />As the leader of the pack, the protagonist of this drama, Leonardo
DiCaprio is first-rate. He brings genuine emotion to the scenes in
which we see Cobb overwhelmed with love for his wife and children, and
he is every bit as convincing in his action star avatar.Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
background score is electrifying.<br /><br />I am going with 10 out of 10 for Chris Nolan&#x27;s Inception. As It&#x27;s the
most original film I&#x27;ve seen in long time. Amazing writing and
storytelling, leaves you exhausted, but in an amazing way.<br /><br />How about this, grab your tickets, this time not with popcorn and
Pepsi, but with Marijuana, and INCEPTION is your trance music.
