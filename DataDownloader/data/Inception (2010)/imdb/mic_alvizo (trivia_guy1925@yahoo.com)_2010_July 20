Christopher Nolan returns to the genre that brought him critical
acclaim with the release of his new film &#x22;Inception&#x22;. This time,
delving through the subconscious and tapping into our dreams. Nolan&#x27;s
earlier films have been about the complexity of the human nature and
how every one of us sometimes confuses fantasy over reality. No other
filmmaker knows the subject well and presents it in moving pictures
with such depth and artistry as much as he does.<br /><br />All the actors involved were excellent with the exception of Ellen Page
who looked too young to play Ariadne, a university student with an
unusual talent in creating and solving puzzles/mazes. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong, I&#x27;ve seen &#x22;Juno&#x22; twice and she did a great job playing the
pregnant teenager. I think she just wasn&#x27;t suited for the role. I&#x27;ve
read an article that Nolan&#x27;s first choice to play the part was Evan
Rachel Wood, but she turned it down. (Must be busy frolicking in the
cemetery with her anti-Christ boyfriend or should I say fianc&#xE9;, Marilyn
Manson!) She could have nailed that role easily with her acting
prowess. Leonardo DiCaprio was Nolan&#x27;s only choice to play the role of
Cobb, a person who specializes in extracting ideas by invading your
subconscious which could yield massive fortunes when used
intelligently. DiCaprio played his part well, as always but I have to
say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played &#x22;Arthur&#x22; whose job is to
research the team&#x27;s target, steals every scene they share together. His
acting was quite remarkable and worthy to be lauded. I&#x27;m not sure if
Nolan was convinced to offer the part to him after watching his
brilliant performance in The Lookout. He definitely made the right
decision in casting him.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is the kind of film that will keep you thinking even after
leaving the movie theater. It&#x27;s a fast paced, edge-of-your-seat and
well-crafted thriller that doesn&#x27;t disappoint. A mind blowing,
grandiose but cleverly original piece of art that actually delivers
more than the hype! Most people would say that Christopher Nolan
created a masterpiece with his box-office hit &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;. In my
opinion, people back then were just curious about Heath Ledger&#x27;s
characterization of the &#x22;Joker&#x22; and have to pay homage to his last
full-length film. No doubt, it was the best movie of 2008 and could
have easily won Best Picture in the Academy Awards if it wasn&#x27;t too
&#x22;mainstream&#x22;! I guess you can&#x27;t measure the quality of a film based on
how much money it made in the box office and what kind of reception it
had from critics and movie-goers. Inception is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
magnum opus, serving as both its writer and director. I don&#x27;t usually
give out spoilers and don&#x27;t consider myself an expert in writing a
movie review. I&#x27;m just a film buff that loves to share stories with
people who have excellent taste in films. To conclude this brief
article, let me recommend to anyone reading this that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is an
enjoyable film to watch not because of its flamboyant special effects
and great performances but also because of its subject matter. The
overall plot may seem confusing and complex but it only adds to its
uniqueness. It&#x27;s one of those films that you have to watch twice or
even a dozen times to get that &#x22;Eureka&#x22; experience!
