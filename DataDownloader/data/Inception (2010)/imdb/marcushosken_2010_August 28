This film is good, though I feel it is over hyped!<br /><br />To begin with the film could have been a lot darker, this would have
increased the guidance rating but that wouldn&#x27;t have been a bad thing!<br /><br />The other point I would like to make is that it was far to long, don&#x27;t
get me wrong Leonardo is a great actor, and the film is a good film,
but I feel this could have been better, in fact it could have been one
of the best films ever with a little polishing!<br /><br />It wont put me off any Chris Nolan films, because he is a great
director, plus Leonardo is a great actor, however I think the biggest
problem for me was that this film was bigged up so much, I was
expecting more and was left a little disappointed!
