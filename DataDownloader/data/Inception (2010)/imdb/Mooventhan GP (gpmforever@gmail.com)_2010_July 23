Unbelievable thinking of Chrishtopher Nolan. I&#x27;ve ever seen before.
Need some reference to understand this movie fully. Still i could not
understand some part of this movie. Need to watch once again. Overall
very great movie. This is the very tough screen play in world cinema
history. Also Excellent performance by DiCaprio. This year DiCaprio
stands with his acting (Shutter Island). Movie rocks in all the area
(BGM,Actor&#x27;s Performance,etc) . This is very great, nowadays people
understanding these type of movies really. <br /><br />Inception : Dream in the Dream in the Dream in the Dream in the Dream.
It never ends, Because you are in endless sleep in 3rd level of dream.
