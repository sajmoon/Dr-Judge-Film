Mr. Nolan has done it again...Many years ago, when he was just starting
out, he came out with the wonderfully convoluted, yet completely
logical masterpiece &#x27;Memento&#x27;, that had people watching runs and reruns
of the movie to try and make sense of what happens...Then, many years
later, the Wachowski Brothers staked their claim with the revolutionary
Matrix movie series (still won&#x27;t like to refer to it as a trilogy, the
third installment was a disaster) which had people having to revisit
the theaters, if only to figure out what &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; really was..Now,
Mr. Nolan has reclaimed his throne of mind-boggling, complex and multi-
layered genius with his latest offering - Inception<br /><br />A wonderfully fascinating concept that uses our most creative figments
of imagination - Inception uses our dreams to weave a plot that is sure
to intrigue you, at the very least. Nolan builds multiple &#x27;levels&#x27;
(quite literally) into a plot that forces you to listen and think over
each and every dialogue uttered by every character to maintain pace
with the drama that unfolds over 140 minutes. &#x27;Your mind is the scene
of the crime&#x27; and &#x27;The dream is real&#x27; - the tag lines that this movie
has been publicized with, are really apt for this movie and give away a
lot more than one would think they do; it would be grave injustice if I
were to reveal anything further of the plot.<br /><br />I know this movie would be compared to the Dark Knight and some might
even suggest that Nolan outdoes himself with Inception, but that would
perhaps be over-stating the case. In my opinion, the movie tends to get
too complicated for its own good and leaves some very pertinent
questions unanswered. Some of the action too, is unwarranted and one
wonders why it was really necessary to insert those set pieces, when a
much different setting was a distinct and much more enticing
possibility. However, my suggestion is don&#x27;t compare this to anything
you have seen before - because its the novelty, sheer creative
imagination and complexity of the plot that are the charm of this flick<br /><br />Fantastic performance by the entire cast, specially Di Capricio and
Ellen Page further add to the quality of the movie but the movie really
belongs to the director himself. Nolan asserts himself in all his
glory, using a multi-layered, convoluted, plot to keep you interested
all throughout. Imagine the kind of attention that he forces you to pay
to something as insignificant as a single spinning top and you will
know exactly what I mean. If all this were not enough, he ends the
movie with an absolute masterstroke that practically carves his
signature touch on to it.<br /><br />Not at all a movie for the masses, so for those who like to watch
movies with their brains left at home - steer clear of this one. On the
other hand, for the enthusiasts looking for a challenge, march right
away to the theater, if nothing else, only to marvel at the genius who
could conceive, develop and transition to motion pictures such creative
brilliance
