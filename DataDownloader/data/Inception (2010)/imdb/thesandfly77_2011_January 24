A Multi-megamix of reference points combines into something very
familiar but still stunningly original.<br /><br />THAT is the beauty of Nolan&#x27;s Magnum Opus.<br /><br />&#x27;It&#x27;s complicated!&#x27; They whine. &#x27;Too clever by half!&#x27; &#x27;Up its own ass!&#x27;
Of course it is. But it DESERVES to be. It&#x27;s a layered mindf*ck of
novel-esque conception, a living book up there on the screen, giving
you no time to analyse but encouraging you to take the ride and let
your brain work it all out on autopilot as the adrenalin frazzles your
imagination.<br /><br />You might just hate it immediately afterwards; like the bewilderment
and guilt of a beautiful one-night stand way out your league.<br /><br />But later you&#x27;ll want more as events turn in your mind; satisfaction
will demand proper comprehension, or at least a cognitive reasoning of
the plot.<br /><br />Inception warrants more than one viewing (if you hadn&#x27;t guessed already
from the hysterics among us).<br /><br />It deserves its high ratings for the attention to detail, for daring to
intellectualise the blockbuster premise. It commits the crime of
hurting the brains of the multiplex popcorn-rustling Crackers. +1
rating there alone.<br /><br />Re: Blade runner - the beginning and end, meshing together to leave
eternal unanswered questions, a macguffin, spinning, spinning, a la
origami unicorn.<br /><br />Great. Watch it. Again.
