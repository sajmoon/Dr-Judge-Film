So this film has been so over-hyped its bound to be a bit of a let
down.<br /><br />The positives are that it has a good director , great actors and some
interesting ideas.<br /><br />The problems are that it is too long, and a bit boring.I stopped caring
about what was going to happen and just wanted the film to end.<br /><br />I think that the problem with this film is that the inhabiting peoples
dreams idea is obviously made up, so you never really know if what is
happening is realistic or not as the director is telling you that this
is how it is, and you just have to accept that this is possible.<br /><br />Suff happens in the dreams that you have no idea whether they could or
couldn&#x27;t happen and characters work their way round problems in ways
that may or may not be clever or realistic....we have no idea , as the
director is just making all this stuff up.<br /><br />plus the wife character is super annoying and the film could have done
without that side story and should have just focused on the industrial
espionage angle.<br /><br />And there are massive plot holes even in the real world parts on the
film , never mind the dream parts.<br /><br />so yea go and see it, its kind of interesting, but its no where near a
9/10.
