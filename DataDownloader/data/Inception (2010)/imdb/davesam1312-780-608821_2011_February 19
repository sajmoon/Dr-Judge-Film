When Christopher Nolan&#x27;s name is attached to a project, that is a sign
that you should automatically go see it. And Inception is a movie that
everyone needs to see! It has been nominated for Best Picture of the
Year, right behind The King&#x27;s Speech and the Social Network. And I
think that this movie more than deserves to win. Not only is it
intelligent but it is extremely entertaining, two qualities that any
one film never seems to successfully combine.<br /><br />First, the story. The previews don&#x27;t give hardly anything away so I
don&#x27;t want to either. But mainly it revolves around Leonardo DiCaprio
as Dom Cobb, an extractor who steals information from people while they
are sleeping. After a failed attempt, he is offered a chance at
redemption by planting an idea in someone&#x27;s mind instead of stealing
one. It is confusing if you don&#x27;t follow it very closely but otherwise
it&#x27;s easy to follow though after it&#x27;s over you will feel compelled to
watch it again to see all the stuff you missed.<br /><br />Second, the visuals. A folding city, exploding buildings - some in
fire, some in pieces, and rotating hallways. One of the more impressive
facts is that besides the folding city, Christopher Nolan managed to
perform almost all the effects with little to no CGI: an impressive
feat in itself.<br /><br />Finally, the acting. Everyone did an outstanding job. Leonardo DiCaprio
and Cillian Murphy were particularly good in my opinion though after
writing that I feel like I just backstabbed the rest of the cast. They
were all magnificent and should all be nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />Overall, Inception is definitely the best movie, not only of the year,
but of the decade. It is absolutely fantastic! It&#x27;s smart,
entertaining, action-packed, and has one of the best endings I&#x27;ve ever
seen! Mr. Nolan, I look forward to your next project!
