Inception...You think you know about dreams, think again! <br /><br />8 years is how long it took &#x22;Inception&#x22; to cook in the head of
mastermind writer, producer and director Christopher Nolan. During that
time he has successfully served us with things like &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22;, &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;. This picture is one
of a kind to say the least and will undoubtedly be noted through
decades to come.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leo DiCaprio), a master dream invader, leads a team of
thought manipulators each of his own specialty, through the ultimate
mission of their craft. After many jobs of stealing corporate secrets,
they&#x27;re now assigned to be creators rather than thieves. They&#x27;re off to
implant ideas rather than taking them away.<br /><br />A good story could always be a solid foundation to making a good movie,
now imagine a story so genuine like almost nothing that&#x27;s been told
before. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is one of those films that are likely to go wrong,
with an idea that could potentially have numerous loopholes unless
written by someone like Christopher Nolan. The mind bending thoughts
that you get throughout the movie keep you alert, attentive and almost
on edge that you may miss something. But then again it&#x27;s taken him all
those years to produce that coherent script, how many times you think
he has read and reread every scene?<br /><br />Needless to say that this movie is likely to be on top of the nominee
list for Film Editing at the next Oscars, other areas of film making
have been presented in a, more than a world class, layout. Look at it
this way, if it hasn&#x27;t all come together, &#x22;Inception&#x22; would&#x27;ve gone
straight to DVD. You hear a train cutting through a hot pursuit on a
side street, and you think of sound mixing and editing. You see
buildings twisted and world physics messed up, you think of visual
effects. Let alone, the cinematography and the art direction that
constantly stand out from the opening scene right through the last
minute.<br /><br />In many ways Inceptions&#x27;s main feature is simplicity of complexity.
More of that is obvious in the movie score. Edith Piaf&#x27;s &#x22;Non, Je ne
regrette rien&#x22; is featured as not only a song but a main factor in
intensifying the story at some point. Take that tune, put it on a very
low pitch and you&#x27;ve got yourself Zach Hemsey&#x27;s Mind Heist which is the
main Inception theme. That well distorted trumpet you hear in the
trailer and all over the movie is none other than a tempo adaptation of
Piaf&#x27;s music. If time is slower during a dream, so should music. Talk
about story coherence. Furthermore, Nolan simplifies the complex even
in front of the camera many times, to name one, rather than using
visual effect in low gravity scenes, he decides to put the whole set on
hydraulics and spin it so that it&#x27;ll look more real. Wait till you see
Joseph Gordon-Levitt walk on the ceiling.<br /><br />Having all, behind the scene, aspects as tight as they&#x27;ve been, Nolan&#x27;s
following mission was to put a team together in front of the camera.
With roles high in diversity, choosing actors had to be anything but an
easy task. It is established that Leonardo DiCaprio was Nolan&#x27;s first
and last choice for the role of Cobb, but he&#x27;s gone through a whole
list of names before choosing the rest. The way I see it, he made all
the right choices. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was James Franco&#x27;s contingency
to play &#x22;Arthur&#x22;. Ellen Page, our beloved Juno, who played &#x22;Ariadne&#x22;,
was considered among names like Emma Roberts, Rachel McAdams and more.
And Tom Hardy &#x22;Eames&#x22;, Cillian Murphy &#x22;Fischer&#x22; together with Oscar
nominee Ken Watanabe &#x22;Saito&#x22; has successfully filled in their
characters&#x27; shoes in a way that is up to the standards of something as
big as &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />More to the list of stars, Academy Award winners Michael Caine and
Marion Cotillard each represent an important relationship to Cobb in
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. The later plays a very complex role from an acting
perspective leading the audience through a roller-coaster of confusion
and emotional disturbance; she nonetheless represents a very important
side of the story that if talked about more, may spoil much, despite
what master critic Rogert Ebert said about the movie being &#x22;Immune to
spoilers&#x22;.<br /><br />From beginning to end, you don&#x27;t get to turn your head. You&#x27;re right in
the creative hands of a film making genius who knows what your mind
loves and feeds it. Exceptional talent surrounds every bit of this
journey. Enjoying it is not an option, it&#x27;s forced upon you.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Watch it!
