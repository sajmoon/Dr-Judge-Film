Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a
blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the
thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the
spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the
greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something
we often don&#x27;t look for...brains! &#x22;What is the most resilient parasite?
An idea&#x22; says Leonardo Di Caprio&#x27;s character Cobb. Well, Inception is
all about ideas. It&#x27;s all right there in the title. The film central
idea revolves around &#x22;Extractors&#x22;, who are paid to extract secrets from
people&#x27;s subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for
the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them
to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is
born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and
invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film&#x27;s
genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings
the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but
never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher
Nolan&#x27;s script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the
sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes
this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is
just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically,
with DiCaprio&#x27;s other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both
films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatized mind can play on
the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep
the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is
an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi
genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the
prison noir of Scorsese&#x27;s film. There is not a single dull moment in
Nolan&#x27;s film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of
the film.
