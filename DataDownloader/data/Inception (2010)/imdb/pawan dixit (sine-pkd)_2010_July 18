this is a kind of movie made in decades.. chris nolan did an
outstanding job making it a milestone in world cinema..this is a movie
that goes with you in your mind everywhere..&#x27; great visual
effects,amazing cinematography and majestic acting with an unimaginable
concept hit deep to your mind. and not allow to see other than the
screen and not allow to think anything else..<br /><br />leonardo &#x22;the great&#x22; caprio showed his life&#x27;s most phenomenal acting, a
step ahead what he has done in aviator and shutter island.his eyes
talk..expressions make everything clear without words.such an eminent
actor who live the role he brought in.....<br /><br />the ace in the hole is the story..its concept of dream..it is really a
mind twister..<br /><br />cinematography juxtaposes the real and the surreal with such finesse,
you never do get confused and always remain aware of the slippery
ground you are treading on.<br /><br />emotional aspects in this movie make it appealing .. usually movies of
this genre leave nothing for emotions but inception showed emotions as
its powerful part.. a new fresh form..<br /><br />so are you ready to dream on..........
