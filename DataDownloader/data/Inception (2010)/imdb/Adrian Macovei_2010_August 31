... than to be remembered as the movie which posed as no. 3. A rating
of eight stars would have been appropriate. Definitely seven. Nine? In
dreams perhaps. So here is one star. Just to bring balance back to
force... And please stop making parallels to Matrix. In this one there
is more than merely FX. Makes you want to know more. The Matrix, well,
everyone understood. It deserves to be seen. It even deserves to be own
on Blu-ray. Not every day you get to see a dynamic Escher or Paris
packing on itself. Unfortunately there is little more that meets the
eye. A top 10 IMDb? Doubtful. Toy Story 3 is no. 12. And that one made
me think more about meanings in life.
