Dark knight and batman begins were the two movies of Christopher
Nolan&#x27;s i watched before inception. Batman begins was great but I
wasn&#x27;t that thrilled about dark Knight in spite of all the positive
reviews it has received. Inception I always thought was a little bit
overrated because I don&#x27;t think it deserved all the Oscar nominations.
Except the music category. The music was absolutely mesmerizing. Hans
Zimmer is a genius. Some will find this theme a bit ridiculous but the
direction alone has turned the movie completely around. I couldn&#x27;t find
a single minute boring. If one is watching a film like this, it should
generally watched like a thriller. Not even the theme should be
disclosed. <br /><br />The performances were great from everyone. Leonardo Dicaprio is indeed
in a standard of his own. I has Ken Watanabe&#x27;s best performance ever.
Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page were perfect for their roles and the
fine trivia behind their combination. They were once competent for the
Oscar award once (Marion cotillard won the competition). Joseph Levitt
Gordon, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao and Michael Caine were all good. The
music was incredible. Technical aspects were all exemplary.<br /><br />This movie should be experienced either in an extremely good theater or
in a high definition home theater system were you won&#x27;t have
concentration removed in any manner. Watching a low quality print takes
the very spirit of movie watching. Which is exactly what will happen to
those who watched it on television with so many advertisements.<br /><br />Inception is indeed one of those different movies that shouldn&#x27;t
missed. Especially by those people who wish to see something different.<br /><br />9/10
