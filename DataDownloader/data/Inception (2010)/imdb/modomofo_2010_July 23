The title pretty much sums the movie up. An absolutely amazing cast and
incredible premise was almost wholly pushed to the margin by special
effects and &#x22;action&#x22;. My hopes were too high. Nolan was clearly out of
his depth as far as intellect goes and totally blew the chance to pull
off an epic, unprecedented dream heist flick.<br /><br />Dear Nolan, if you&#x27;re reading this: You can give guns, grenade
launchers and C4 to a cast of unknown actors, place them virtually
anywhere and have them destroy everything in sight for two hours, and
it would have been just as good as this movie.<br /><br />Thanks for ripping me off by luring me in with an allure that promised
slick corporate spies engaged in mind games in surreal settings and
instead taking it from a promising half-way point into a senseless
visceral joyride that was quite literally the cinematic equivalent of
van Gogh painting Starry Night then taking a bowie to it and slashing
it to ribbons before the paint has a chance to dry.<br /><br />It&#x27;s painfully clear that you wrote the script to allow you to stroke
your ego with the most over-the-top action flick you could cook up.
With the money you spent on all the great actors you employed for this,
you could have hired a dozen great writers to develop a script that
would have actually been worthy of their talent. You sir, simply WASTED
it. I actually feel embarrassed for Michael Caine. That such a fine
actor was dragged into this crap is sad. You could have just flashed a
still photograph of his face for a few frames and it would have
sufficed since you don&#x27;t pause for even a second to develop ANY of the
characters except for Cobb and anyone with half a brain was probably
wondering WHY character development was so scant in a film that deals
so heavily with the subconscious mind. No, I guess a car chase was more
important. <br /><br />It&#x27;s entirely beyond me why you tainted your ego-stroking action flick
with a genuinely thought-provoking premise when all the &#x22;smart parts&#x22;
flew over the heads of your target audience by a wide berth.<br /><br />tl;dr version: shallow, pseudointellectualist excuse for making an
obscene, self-gratifying action flick. I hope to god you get your
money&#x27;s worth if you actually pay to see this garbage.
