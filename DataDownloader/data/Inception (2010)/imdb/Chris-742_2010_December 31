This movie has several dazzling special effects. But other than that,
what is there to say. Well, mainly....YAWN. Many comedy movies are just
sketches strung together with the barest of threads to hold the plot
together. Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action
sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be
complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that
you could put Incepton&#x27;s entire budget for special effects into each
one of them. Inceptions virtual world does not impress because it is a
work of beauty without any connection with dreams at all. Take away the
special effects and you are left with substandard, uninspired acting
and a boring movie.
