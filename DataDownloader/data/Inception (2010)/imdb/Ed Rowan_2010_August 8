This really is a one of a kind must see movie. <br /><br />Aware that the hyperbole of blockbusters sometimes overplays the
aewsomeness of the actual film, I walked into the cinema with an open
mind and mellow expectations. Thing is, this film is so unique, that no
review or trailer can really capture the essence and intellectual
dynamism contained within.<br /><br />Nolan has raised the bar of what a mainstream blockbuster can possibly
deliver. Special effects, high production values, amazing acting AND a
plethora of cerebral treats, all blended seamlessly, will keep most
people engrossed till the very end. I say &#x27;most&#x27; because I do think
some will find it difficult to keep up with the pace. I did find myself
having to put the effort in after two thirds of the way through. Of
course though, this should not be seen as a bad thing, but it might put
the less enlightened movie goer off a little. The multi - layered and
thought provoking plot does indeed reward intellect as they say. <br /><br />All the acting is fully believable and it was such a treat to see some
visceral and emotionally real relations between the supporting cast.
The light hearted camaraderie between Jospeph Gordon-Levitt and Tom
Hardy is priceless, and there&#x27;s a simmering chemistry between J GL and
Ellen Page, both providing a fair smattering of chuckles throughout.
Nothing taken away from Leo of course, his story is centre piece and
pivotal, but there&#x27;s equal chances for awards for all I&#x27;d say. The only
slight criticism I may have is that sometimes, say when little nuggets
of information are given about dream technology, ideas are a little
forced or hurried. I suspect perhaps it was a challenge in itself to
fit everything in at 2 and a half hours, and it really is barely worth
mentioning.<br /><br />Genuinely, Nolan has given something special to the movie world with
this movie. Do yourself a favour; go pay money to see it and take away
a unique experience and an ever so slightly expanded mind.
