While just as silly and more or less pointless as his earlier flicks,
Nolan has created in Inception a decent enough heist movie. Just think
of it as a movie about a multi-layered holodeck program, however,
designed by programmers familiar with Counter Strike, cinematography,
and disaster movies, since the idea of dreams in this film is quite
banal and undreamlike, really - they are capitalist espionage tools
with all the subconscious removed, or rather, translated into what is
familiar to Nolan - a kind of Michael Bay alternate reality. The story,
touted as complex, is complex only on the level that it is a heist
movie - a fairly straightforward and very linear heist movie. There&#x27;s
no psychology (one character&#x27;s statement that &#x22;it&#x27;s all about X&#x22; is the
entire psychological content of the film - the oldest trope in the book
becomes a single, meaningless line) philosophy, ethics, and certainly
no spirituality involved. I&#x27;ve seen some making comparisons to Solaris,
either Tarkovsky&#x27;s or Soderburgh&#x27;s, but these are specious comparisons,
made in a desperate attempt to elevate Nolan&#x27;s vacant shenanigans.
Don&#x27;t believe it. The film is a hoax. It&#x27;s fun, but it&#x27;s a hoax.
Nolan&#x27;s characters are all self-centered and only speak the
technobabble or reductionist claptrap Nolan forces into their mouths,
there&#x27;s not a shred of intellect anywhere.<br /><br />One step above a Michael Bay creation, and that&#x27;s it.
