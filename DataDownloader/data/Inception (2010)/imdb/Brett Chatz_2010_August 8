Inception indeed sports a stellar cast and its ratings have been an
unqualified success. However, in spite of such commendations, this film
is at best mediocre. It reeks of the residue of the Matrix and has
elements of other much-loved dream caper films such as the Nightmare on
Elm Street series of yesteryear.<br /><br />The special effects are mind-blowing, the acting is par excellence, but
the concept itself - rather than being sublime, is in fact nothing
spectacular at all. The gist of it is that Di Caprio&#x27;s character is
able to enter the minds and dreams of his subjects. He plants seeds to
uncover data and everyone becomes interlocked in the same dream, with
surprising twists and turns.<br /><br />The twist in the film - let&#x27;s leave that to the audience to uncover -
is hardly worth the running time of the film and what it promises in
terms of high-impact mind-blowing content falls short of films like The
Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Overall, it&#x27;s nothing more than a high-tech
visual extravaganza of spectacular stunts and a seemingly LSD-induced
storyline.
