When I saw the poster of Inception around January 2010 I thought to
myself this new Christopher Nolan movie ought to be fantastic. Was that
an underestimation or what !!!<br /><br />Christopher Nolan cant seem to make a movie that is anything under than
absolutely mind blowing. His resume now holds movies such as Insomnia,
Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Is it his
attention to detail or the story he comes up with or the brilliant
action and suspense he is able to generate; its just sheer cinematic
brilliance.<br /><br />Inception, the concept behind this movie involves planting an idea into
someone else&#x27;s head and the storyline that is spun around it is simply
beautiful. Leo&#x27;s character Cobb is a thief who steals secrets through
dreams and now, in order to get home to his children, needs to actually
plant an idea into Cillian Murphy&#x27;s head - Inception. <br /><br />I can&#x27;t help but notice the similarities between Leo Dicaprio&#x27;s
character in this movie and in Shutter Island even though they are
completely unrelated. And much like Memento, you are left wondering
during scenes which reality you are a part of right now. Some of the
dream sequences shot for the movie remind you so much of the brilliant
gravity defying action from The Matrix. And unlike The Matrix (I must
mention here I&#x27;m a huge fan of The Matrix Trilogy) Nolan actually gives
the characters some depth.<br /><br />Leo Dicaprio, much like Shutter Island, cruises through his role with
little effort as do Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the rest of
the cast. Ellen Page looks sweet and innocent in her role and Micheal
Caine also makes his mandatory appearance in a Christopher Nolan movie
albeit in a cameo appearance. But the undoubted start of the movie
again is Chris Nolan himself who creates scenes that leave you gasping
for breath saying expletives on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />A true masterpiece and a must watch!!
