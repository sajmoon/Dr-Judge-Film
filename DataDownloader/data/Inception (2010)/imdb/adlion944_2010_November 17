Inception is right up my alley. I was expecting a thinking person&#x27;s
thriller with a bit of sci fi. C Nolan is well known - I loved the Dark
Knight and Batman Begins. He&#x27;s quality and tells a slow boiling story
that pays off a concept. But whew, Inception... wow what a stinker.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no question that this production staff and the cast took this
project and themselves very seriously. It oozes production values. Too
bad it lost me in the first 10 minute when I had no idea what was
happening. And not in a good way, like other thrillers. I had
absolutely no desire to understand the clap-trap these unlikeable
characters were spouting. The kid from Third Rock, wow he thinks he&#x27;s
quite the bad boy. Fail.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of something that held my interest, this movie simply
frustrated me. Inception is a ponderous, self-important, vacuous movie.
It&#x27;s empty, all presentation, no flavor. It makes no sense and I didn&#x27;t
even want to keep straining to figure it out. It doesn&#x27;t unfold like
&#x22;The Game&#x22; where you&#x27;re dying to know how it comes out, clue by clue. I
even stuck with Shutter Island and didn&#x27;t really like that one, but it
was way, way, way better than this movie. And it&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t
have patience for high-concept. It&#x27;s not ambiguous or thought-provoking
it just ends.<br /><br />Still, I would recommend others see this film and judge for themselves.
Others seem to find this movie very intense and deep. I just don&#x27;t get
it. Personal preference, but there are quite a few like me where
metaphysical pseudo sci-fi speeches, and lots of rules about what you
can and can&#x27;t do are just frustrating and not a nice evening&#x27;s
entertainment. I think I&#x27;ll go watch The Game or Matrix again. It&#x27;s
been a while and I need to get the sour taste of this movie out of my
mouth.
