Inception is a decent action movie. It&#x27;s well acted and produced. The
weaknesses are on story and message side. Plot is pretty obvious.
Overall Inception is mixing some 007 stuff we&#x27;ve seen in several other
occasions and something matrix like with on-the-surface multileveled
story. Worst of all, the message of the movie (which deals somehow with
the love, reality and letting go of the sad past) is left vague and
superficial. It simply did not touch me. To put it short, Inception
seemed came through to me as a bagful of old tricks covered with some
special effects.<br /><br />Movie definitely is not worth the current 9.2 rating in IMDb. Being
social media professional, the unreasonably high rating of an average
movie leads me to wonder if social media has been commercially
manipulated.
