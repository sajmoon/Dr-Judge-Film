Comparing this movie to The Matrix is an insult to the Matrix, the
directors of the Matrix, and basically anyone who had anything to do
with the production of the Matrix.<br /><br />This movie has an interesting premise, but I was not a fan of the
storytelling style. Yes the movie had multiple things going on at once
later in the movie, but I felt the movie was insulting my intelligence
by reminding me what was happening in each scene every 5 minutes and
cutting back to them, like I get what is going on, keep on with the
main movie. The movie spends 30 minutes with scenes that are just to
confuse, only to explain them in about 30 seconds later in the movie. I
was bored to death in this movie, and I am a scifi fan. I am not
qualified really to comment on the acting, but I thought it was pretty
good. The whole time, it seemed like the movie thought it was some type
of epic, but it really was too long, uninteresting, and slow moving.<br /><br />This movie fails. It is too slow and simplistic for a scifi fan to
enjoy, and too complicated for a good percentage of people (my dad) to
understand.<br /><br />Also the last 30 minutes of the movie should have been cut. There are
only a few memorable scenes/quotes in the movie.<br /><br />I made an account here to let you guys know with this tough economical
time, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this movie does not live up to the hype, and I
cannot believe some of the reviews praising it.<br /><br />I may seem like a hater, but if you don&#x27;t believe me on how bad it is,
go waste 10 dollars and two and a half hours of your life and you will
be in the same boat as me, someone who hated this movie.
