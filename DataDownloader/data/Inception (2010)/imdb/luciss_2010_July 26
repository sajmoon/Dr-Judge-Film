Perfect direction. Perfect ensemble. Perfect screenplay.<br /><br />Inception is a very carefully planned story and conception, backed by a
great production, and most of all, a great cast that manage to achieve
perfect balance, with the sole exception of Marion Cotillard, whose
stand out performance is due an Oscar nomination, at least.<br /><br />It&#x27;s visual effects are something that may bring the question of &#x22;Why
not 3D?&#x22;. Well, 3D wasn&#x27;t needed to bring what the movie wanted to
show, and it was much better this way. The story is deep, mysterious,
and certainly will affect you.<br /><br />Inception is definitely the movie of this summer, and most likely of
the year. Christopher Nolan has definitely surpassed himself and
established as one of the top directors of this generation.
