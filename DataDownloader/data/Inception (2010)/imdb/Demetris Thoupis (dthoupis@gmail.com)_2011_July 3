The main danger of Nolan is that with every movie he makes he sets the
expectations bar even higher and this is no exception. I really wanted
to give this movie a 20 or maybe not a 100!!! This is how great this
movie is. When I saw it, I did not watch the trailers or anything for
the movie and just went in blind without knowing what to expect at all.
What I saw was an epic spectacle which kept me on my seat with nothing
else on my mind but watching the grandeur direction, acting and story
of this film. An amazing score, an amazing cast, a great storyline with
some clich&#xE9; elements I need to say but that is no reason to diminish
the bar of this movie. I also love Nolans&#x27; love for real time action
sequences with using as little CG animation as possible in all his
movies. The spinning corridor is one of the most epic scenes I have
seen in a movie. Now who is dying to see the Dark Knight Rises!!<br /><br />Demetris
