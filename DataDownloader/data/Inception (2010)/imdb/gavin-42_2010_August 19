I must be, like, getting old and jaded or something. I found the movie
predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would be.<br /><br />A good alternative name for the film would have been &#x22;Wait, what?&#x22; as
if there was any less action you&#x27;d be constantly asking yourself why
the eff they didn&#x27;t do X, or why Y didn&#x27;t happen etc. The word
&#x22;contrived&#x22; will keep nudging at your brain if you&#x27;re not doing an
exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common
sense.<br /><br />The final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thought.<br /><br />I found it relatively easy to follow, exactly what I was expecting, and
totally lacking in interesting &#x22;Sixth Sense&#x22; plot twists. Everything
pretty much was as it was presented to be.<br /><br />Not sure how this makes it to #3 on the all-time best list.<br /><br />The Matrix was way more entertaining...<br /><br />G.
