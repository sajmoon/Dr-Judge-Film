1. Actors. All of them, incredible acting. I mean, all of them. Each
actor in this movie touched the acting perfection. What a cast ! <br /><br />2. FX. Truly amazing (with double merit because most of then are NOT
CGI). I&#x27;m still wondering how some scenes were created.<br /><br />3. Cinematography / photography is absolutely amazing. Camera&#x27;s
movements, focusing, slow motion, sets... All is incredible.<br /><br />4. Script / plot / story. Complex, non linear, surprising, very well
thought. Original. Fresh. I never thought after seeing Memento I
couldn&#x27;t see something better... obviously, I was wrong ! <br /><br />5. Action / rhythm. Perfect balancing between action and
acting/sentiment. The fight scenes are incredible. Joseph G deserves an
special mention for his amazing work without using stunts.<br /><br />6. Music/sound. Amazing. Hans did an incredible score which empowers
the feelings and action of the movie. The sound effects are extremely
good too.<br /><br />7. The ending is absolutely brilliant and heart-attack.<br /><br />8. Direction. All it&#x27;s extremely well executed and consistent. All.
Each detail matters. I have no words.<br /><br />Inception is a masterpiece. Nolan&#x27;s best creation with no doubt and one
of the best films I&#x27;ve seen in 10 years ( the previous one was Matrix
in 1999 ). This movie is a &#x22;must see several times&#x22;. I&#x27;m sure it will
rock the Oscars of 2010 and it will be a box-office success.<br /><br />10 of 10, perfect movie ( and, trust me, I don&#x27;t say all the days ).
