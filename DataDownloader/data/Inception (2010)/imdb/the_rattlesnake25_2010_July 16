Visually mesmerising and narratively enthralling, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
stop-gap project before he commits to the third film in his Batman saga
is a non-stop thrill ride which delivers on all levels; consciously and
sub-consciously. Like everybody else in the real world, Dom Cobb
(Leonardo DiCaprio) has a full-time job except, unlike the rest of
society, his job transcends realities. His work involves extracting
confidential and sensitive information from client&#x27;s minds as they
wander in an artificial dream-like state. To attempt this intricate
process, they require an &#x27;architect&#x27; who will construct the dream world
in which the client&#x27;s subconscious is drawn into, before extracting the
information from them. As Cobb mentions however, this process can
essentially degenerate into &#x27;theft&#x27; as clients may subconsciously place
their secrets inside a bank or safe, which the team will have to crack
to explore and exploit.<br /><br />After a job goes askew, Cobb is hired by the shady businessman Saito
(Ken Watanabe) to perform an almost impossible, and incredibly complex
act; Inception. Instead of extracting an idea or information, inception
requires the planting of an idea into the subconscious mind of the
client, thereby influencing any potential future decisions they may
make, e.g. implanting into the mind of a client the suggestion that
they should release an inferior product in the future to allow a rival
competitor to prosper. Cobb assembles together a well-respected and
able team of experts willing to commit to the act of inception,
including the forger Eames (Tom Hardy), who has the ability to assume
any identity in the dream world, the architect Adriadne (Ellen Page)
who is young student constructing the world in which they will tread,
the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) who is providing the substances that
will allow them to stay under in the dream world for an extended period
of time, and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is the team&#x27;s &#x27;point
man&#x27; and Cobb&#x27;s highly regarded second in command.<br /><br />Despite its hundred and sixty million dollar budget which is most
prominent in the film&#x27;s stunning visuals, the real endearing aspect of
&#x27;Inception&#x27; is the brilliant story which Nolan allows to slowly unravel
throughout the two hours and twenty minutes of run time. Constantly
keeping the tension at appropriate heights, while also allowing the
story to develop showcasing various twists and tales, Nolan&#x27;s
screenplay is the intricate competent which truly makes the film work
on various inter-connecting levels. From mystery-thriller, to science
fiction and a hefty dose of drama, as the story unfolds, the visuals
dazzle, and the characters themselves continue to grow, develop and
prosper in this artificial environment.<br /><br />On the surface &#x27;Inception&#x27; is a heist movie in really simple, generic
terms, but under the surface it contains underlying themes of love,
loss, grief and the inability to forget those we used to, and still do
love. Despite constantly being surrounded by dangerous situations in
both realities, Cobb&#x27;s real danger comes in the form of his memories
and in particular those of his wife (Marion Cotillard). While the other
members of his team seem to perform their actions for the thrill of the
event and the payment on delivery, Cobb is instead restricted by
outside factors which keep him constrained within his transcending
prison of never-ending certainty, and this (in?)sanity is projected to
the audience in a typically emotional and brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio
performance. Aside from DiCaprio, the always radiant Joseph
Gordon-Levitt gives yet another proficient acting performance he can be
proud of. Yet, despite the array of talent on show including DiCaprio
and Sir Michael Caine, no doubt for the next few months the name
trickling out of the Casting Department&#x27;s on both sides of the Atlantic
will be that of the gentlemanly Tom Hardy. From obscurity to the A-List
in a matter of years, not bad for the London man who only got his
leading role a mere eighteen months ago.<br /><br />But the real question here is; Can Christopher Nolan do no wrong? With
&#x27;Inception&#x27; comes the directors seventh feature film, and with this his
sixth film to open to startling critical acclaim, and as many will
agree, rightly so. Nolan has created a fantastically imaginative world
where nobody is even safe, even when their bodies shut down and decide
to roam the depths of the human subconscious. His story draws you in,
while the gravity-defying action and unstable personalities of the
characters keep you deeply rooted in your seat for a well-spent two
hours and twenty minutes of pure, leisurely cinematic enjoyment.
