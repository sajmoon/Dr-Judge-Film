Back in India, majority of us usually watch a Hollywood movie on the
big screen only if it has mind blowing special effects, great animation
and super entertainment value. We were not used to focus much on the
story line, screenplay, camera etc. But I should say this movie changed
the way we look at movies in the future. It has raised the bar so much
that Christopher Nolan should think about cloning himself, so we could
get more movies like this every year.<br /><br />I am huge admirer of Leonardo. I watched every single one of his
movies, and mostly, the entire movie&#x27;s success will rest on his
shoulders, but not &#x27;Inception&#x27;, this movie&#x27;s biggest strength is the
story, the idea. However Leonardo was perfect with the role and so does
every single one of the cast. To be honest, I was shocked as how
someone could come up such a concept, and i was thinking about that all
night after the first time i saw the picture. Simply brilliant. <br /><br />I should mention the music scores in the film. Hans Zimmer once again
proved why he is one of the best in the business. The score completely
goes with every frame, and it induces a great sense of eagerness,
suspense and excitement as we move on with the story. Perfect.<br /><br />I should say this movie should be rated infinity/10. This is an epic, a
once in a lifetime movie thats should be watched at the big screen. The
art of cinema is not confined to any religion, community or country.
Inception is the proof. Hats off Christopher Nolan.
