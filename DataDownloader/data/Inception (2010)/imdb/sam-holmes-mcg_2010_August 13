I went into this movie expecting something profound in every aspect
that a movie can potentially portray; this was due to the fact that I
trusted the intellectual integrity of the people who had told me that
it was one of the best movies that they had ever seen. During the
movie, I was falling asleep in the beginning (where the plot is really
being described), but still was able to understand the movie fully. The
people rating this movie with 10 stars are so infatuated with the fact
that they had to think in order to understand the movie fully, they&#x27;re
looking past 2 things; a) they probably need to think to do a lot of
things if understanding this movie required an immense amount of
thought, b) this actually just isn&#x27;t the one of the best movies ever
created. The plot had loop holes and parts that didn&#x27;t make sense, and
sometimes the &#x22;rules&#x22; (per say) of the dream world weren&#x27;t really put
into use, and often broken.<br /><br />The reason I&#x27;m giving this movie 6 stars is because it is still
nevertheless a good movie, but intelligent? No. Should it be the #3
highest rated movie on IMDb? No. Should the stupid people who think
they&#x27;re smart stop clogging the reviews and allow people who could
think straight throughout the entire movie to review it? Absolutely,
and this movie being considered as one of the best movies of all time
is a premature bi-product of the latter. <br /><br />Final Note: Good movie, unbelievable visuals, completely unworthy.
