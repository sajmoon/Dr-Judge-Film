In Inception, one can build the world by imagination. It seems to be
easy to create one&#x27;s dream. At the very beginning, Dom Copp see
inserting an idea in one&#x27;s minds deeply as no hard task. Actually, the
following hardships are all due to his weakness in facing Mal. Dom Copp
seems to be able to control all the situations. In fact, he cannot
event create his own dream. Though the plot seems to tell us it&#x27;s easy
to conquer our deep fear by changing our dream, its ending indicates
that our subconscious overpowers all human minds. In fact, I don&#x27;t
think that what Dom Copp wants to be inserted into is subconscious--
it&#x27;s just a belief. Subconscious is mighty. It cannot be called
subconscious if we can alter it in such an simple way.
