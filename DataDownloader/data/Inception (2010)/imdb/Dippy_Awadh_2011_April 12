..and I don&#x27;t mean nuclear!! This movie is proof that the Americans are
not the greatest filmmakers by a long shot. A slow convoluted
plot--something about trees that have consciousness, are witness to a
rape and murder. Man, I didn&#x27;t know whether to laugh or just curse out
RedBox once again for duping me. Doesn&#x27;t anyone at RedBox actually
watch the movies first? What I wound up doing, was conducting my own
experiment-- by peeing on a bush, while making abusive comments.
Nothing happened for a day or two, then suddenly I got a horrific rash
on my johnson. Do plants actually react to dreams? Not sure if the rash
was coincidental or not. You be the judge.<br /><br />This movie was a basically a shot per shot remake of Paprika (2006).
