The movie was this one-of-a-kind, classy and amazing one!!! Anything to
do with the brain I&#x27;m in and this Christopher Nolan movie was about
crimes done by inducing dreams into people&#x27;s heads and making them
react a certain way&#x85;. Sheer brilliance!!!:) Jaw-dropping slow motion
sequences and an unparalleled concept! Great work of editing and such
success in getting such a complex idea into the layman&#x27;s brains :) And
Leonardo di Caprio is absolutely phenomenal and even better-it feels
like heaven jus lookin at the guy!:) The movie did have its flaws&#x85; no
take-away for life other than probably &#x27;never stop imagining- sky&#x27;s the
limit- dream on&#x27;! and it was more of an intellectual and conceptual
movie that highly successfully blew the head away, but failed to reach
the heart&#x85; except probably the love between Caprio and Cotillard&#x85; so I
don&#x27;t see Oscars-even for a movie this phenomenal&#x85; somewhere down the
line it &#x27;failed&#x27; to get me clapping and cheering and also at the same
time completely taking me over mind-&#x26;-soul like how a &#x27;Gladiator&#x27;,
&#x27;Forrest Gump&#x27;, &#x27;Finding Neverland&#x27;, &#x27;Beautiful Mind&#x27; or an
&#x27;Equilibrium&#x27; did&#x85; it jus took my &#x27;mind&#x27;&#x85; in these ways I thought the
movie was not wholesome for people of all ages to watch, and most
importantly to &#x27;cherish&#x27; for the rest of their lives&#x85; &#x27;Inception&#x27; is
amazing, aggressive, awesome smart artwork&#x85; but not the
&#x27;will-change-how-mankind-will-feel&#x27; kinds&#x85;.&#x27;just&#x27; brilliant, smart
entertainment at a never-seen-before level of intellect. This is not
just a &#x27;gal&#x27;s&#x27; way of saying, that no movie is good if not &#x27;touching&#x27;&#x85;
the only &#x27;complaint/aching&#x27; is the under-utilization of a movie&#x27;s
immeasurable power/ability to, in &#x27;many-other-ways&#x27; &#x27;plant an idea/seed
of thought&#x27; in a generation&#x27;s hearts and &#x27;not just the heads&#x27; :) talk
about planting dreams in people&#x27;s heads&#x85; not in reality something that
will actually &#x27;inspire&#x27; :)so not a perfect 10 for this one...
