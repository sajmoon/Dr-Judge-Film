Although &#x22;Inception&#x22; is certainly an entertaining film, I suspect that
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s primary purpose in creating this labyrinthine and
intriguing work of cinematic art was not entertainment. I believe Nolan
wants to provoke our preconceived notions of reality and self-will and
tease us with the idea that we can never be certain of the nature of
reality&#x97;or our ability to conceive an idea wholly independently. The
plot of this film is almost beside-the-point&#x97;that&#x27;s not to say,
however, that it isn&#x27;t clever or exciting. It is in fact a complex
tapestry of narrative layers and dreams within dreams, dreams that
feature characters who engage in the legendary struggle between passion
and reason. But the plot and the characters are there merely as tools
that allow Nolan to examine his grand themes. I&#x27;ve seen this film just
once, but I strongly suspect that a second viewing will yield a far
more satisfying experience.
