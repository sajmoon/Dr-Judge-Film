2010_July 15 
I&#x27;ve never done a review before so be gentle, but having attended the
Irish premiere of Inception last night I felt compelled to write and
tell people to &#x22;go and see this movie&#x22;. If you only see one picture all
year make sure this is it.<br /><br />As people have stated dream movies have been done before however not
with this style and &#x27;complicated simplicity&#x27; (you&#x27;ll understand what I
mean when you see it).<br /><br />The acting by everyone is first rate, if the emotional story of Cobb
and Mal wasn&#x27;t believable then the film would fall asunder however Di
Caprio/Coitillard carry it off to perfection. Everyone else in the
ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy (get
this guy more work).<br /><br />Unlike many reviewers I didn&#x27;t find the story difficult to follow
although rapt attention is essential, and Nolan has delivered a story
which doesn&#x27;t attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix
instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the
finest piece of film making I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />The end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my
hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running
down my back. Truly outstanding stuff, Christopher Nolan you&#x27;re a
genius.
