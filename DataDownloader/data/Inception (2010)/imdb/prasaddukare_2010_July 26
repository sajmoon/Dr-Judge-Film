The only thing you remember when you watch &#x22;INCEPTION&#x22; is INCEPTION
itself. <br /><br />I forgot to eat my pop-corn or the drink that was...... And there was a
superlative silence in the crowd, quite an unknown fact in a Mumbai
theater. <br /><br />As for concept, the movie was sheer brilliance,and awesome. We the
Sci-Fi mongoose had chewed on many similar concepts as The 13th Floor,
Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix. <br /><br />You can compare the movie with Matrix on the aspect that both deal with
the &#x22;SUBCONSCIOUS&#x22;. But Inception gets better as the entire movie is
just a subconscious play. We start with a single dream and then we
enter the manipulations of &#x22;dream-within-dream&#x22;. You also enjoy the
mathematical trick played to show the detailed event sequences at each
level of the dream, the unstable nature of thought and the laws of
physics questioned&#x85;.<br /><br />Acting-wise each character has it own frames of brilliance with
Leonardo of course scoring better than others. Small cameos played by
Michael Caine too get noted. You also, have very few but distinct funny
moments, like the Kiss trick played on Page.<br /><br />I am by far hooked to Mr. Nolan&#x27;s movies right from
Following-Memento-Insomnia-Batman Begins-The Dark Knight and now
Inception. From concept to SFX to the complete film -Inception-is
10/10, no less.<br /><br />I am just awaiting the next thing from Mr. Nolan
