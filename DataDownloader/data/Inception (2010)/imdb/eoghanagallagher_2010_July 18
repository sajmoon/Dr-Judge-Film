Dear Christopher, I first suspected something might be a little off
when a high octane action sequence at the start turns out to be
happening in a virtual reality constructed in somebody&#x27;s mind. When you
see all the characters reclining unconscious a la Neo, Trinity,
Morpheus and the gang &#x27;in the real world&#x27;, there was a &#x27;Matrix rip-off&#x27;
alert going off inside me! Im just shocked that only the Independent
(UK), New York Observer, Village Voice and a few other reputable
critics have managed to see through your borderline plagiarism-filled,
overlong, ridiculously plotted, boring, self-important excuse for a
movie. Lucky for you, everyone seems to love it. Did you enter their
unconscious and plant the idea??? Its a really bad idea to try and rip
off the Matrix. That movie has been made already. Its a really good
movie. Unfortunately, Mr. Nolan, you didn&#x27;t come up with the idea for
that movie. The Wachowski brothers did. Get over it. Make your own
movies. I thought Dark Knight and Memento and some of your other flicks
were fine and enjoyable but this is utter garbage. Why didn&#x27;t you go
all the way and get Leo to wear a full-length leather jacket and master
some Kung Fu techniques? Some folks left early (lucky for them). I&#x27;ll
be urging everyone not to waste time or money on seeing this crap.
Sincerely Eoghan
