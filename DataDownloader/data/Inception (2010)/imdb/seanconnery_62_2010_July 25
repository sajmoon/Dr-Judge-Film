This has got to be Christopher Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece without any
hesitation. I saw the film during prime days in Stockholm. The
expectations were relatively high, and throughout the movie, I was
blown away by the film&#x27;s visual images and original style.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan draws us right into the movie without giving us a any
direct action, but slowly but surely, everything becomes a fantastic
crossing between &#x22;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&#x22;, &#x22;Matrix&#x22; and
&#x22;Dark City&#x22;.<br /><br />The acting is of high caliber, especially Leonardo Dicaprio who conveys
his role with feeling and is certainly a worthy Oscar winner.
Supporting cast handles the job superbly, but I especially liked the
Tom Hardy, most recognized from the British drama &#x22;Bronson&#x22;. Not only
do I honor the films visuals, but the film&#x27;s musical score also holds
together the whole drama with pure excitement.<br /><br />So, does this film exceed Nolan&#x27;s interpretation of Batman? presumably
it does so, mostly because of its originality. See it for yourselves
and create your own point of view. Personally, this is probably a
favorite of mine now.
