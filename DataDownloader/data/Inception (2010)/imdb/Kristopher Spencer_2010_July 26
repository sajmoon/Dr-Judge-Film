I really looked forward to this movie, knowing that Nolan does wonders
with high concepts. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in that regard. I found
Inception to be highly engaging, fiercely intelligent, meticulously
designed and superbly executed. I knock it one star because the
emotional content is overwhelmed by the conceptual content. Leo and
Marion certainly try hard to give the movie heart, but ultimately their
relationship just doesn&#x27;t feel real. That said, I think Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
score does an outstanding job at providing an emotional undercurrent to
the action. In some ways, he&#x27;s the most valuable player here after the
writer/director himself. I&#x27;m deeply impressed with this movie, but I
wish Nolan would&#x27;ve established the central relationship in a more
concrete way before thrusting the viewer down the rabbit hole. I&#x27;m not
sure there was an easy way to do that, but it might have helped.
