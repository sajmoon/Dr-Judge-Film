Imagine that the military invented a way to penetrate the human sleep
and even arrange some kind of conference between some sleep. Of course
this technology have adopted industrial thieves. Cobb (DiCaprio), one
of the best thieves retrievers. And he extracts the idea of sleeping
head, such as that which stores the secret papers, or other important
information.<br /><br />Once one of the objects extraction Saito (Watanabe) exposes thieves in
his dream and invites them to work. Must not remove, and introduce the
idea in my head scion of a rich family of Fisher (Murphy). Golden child
should, joining the legacy to destroy energy empire his father. In
addition to Cobb in what may be placed in a man&#x27;s head the idea and
make him believe that it was his idea, not so much. But Cobb has no
choice. Or, he agreed and had no further problems with the law or it
kills the evil corporation, or he gets all his life in prison. To the
idea has taken root it should be placed very deep in the subconscious
of the object implementation. To do this, Cobb and his team organized a
dream within a dream, and again in a dream. &#x422;&#x43E; &#x435;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x442;&#x440;&#x438; &#x443;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x441;&#x43D;&#x430;.
That is, three levels of sleep. This is when a person falls asleep in
the first dream, he again falls asleep in the second dream he saw a
third dream. Complicated? But feasible, although with difficulty.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of the fight against subconscious object
implementation in Cobb is a fierce battle with his own mind. And in
this battle, he confronts his deceased wife and the past, connecting
them.<br /><br />Can you answer the question we sleep or awake, is not whether we live
in a world of his dreams and illusions where the boundary between
reality and fiction? After this movie I&#x27;m afraid that the issues will
become even greater.<br /><br />Now for the main.<br /><br />But watching it should be mandatory. I was the last time such an
impression made &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; Fincher in 1999. Jaya I could not resist
one day twice looked &#x22;inception&#x22;. And every time his hands sweating on
the happenings on the screen. This was not with me. A terrific action I
have not seen. Now, calmly and in detail.<br /><br />First - this plot. It is a layered and quite nonlinear, but the complex
story is absolutely clear, if the head turn. At first hard to grasp the
complexity of movements in sleep, the subconscious level, and other
mind games. But by the end of the movie plot is closed and the picture
becomes very clear and from this insight emotions are overlapped.
Conundrum I do not remember.<br /><br />The second - an idea. Nolan skillfully in his every film explores the
brink of reason. In &#x22;Memento ...&#x22; it was a memory game, in &#x22;Insomnia,&#x22;
they were playing with a physical entity sleep, &#x22;Batman: begins&#x22; and
&#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; They were playing with the personality and its
splitting into the dark and bright side, &#x22;Prestige&#x22; They were playing a
split personality in the literal sense. The idea of how real world and
where the boundary with the fantasy of a very old, but Christopher
Nolan has developed it into a very interesting direction. It
successfully demonstrated as a man with the power of thought can
replace the reality of the dream and go into this so far, that only in
a dream can be reality. Complicated? See the movie.<br /><br />Third - a picture. Taken all just amazing. And most importantly it&#x27;s
not special effects, which, after &#x22; Avatar &#x22;is difficult to surprise,
namely the scenes live without a computer, in a real studio, using the
artistic and engineering techniques and optical illusion. I mean all
the scenes with the change of gravity (in the car, in the hallway, in
the elevator shaft, etc.) Search in the network there are clips from
the shooting. And I&#x27;ll wait for the movie on BluRay with full
supporting materials.<br /><br />Fourth - is the sound and music. Please read what the composer Hans
Zimmer has created a full-fledged hero of the film. Sound and music
complements the visuals and skillfully emphasizes every movement in the
frame. A rare combination of power happened. Zimmer is not for nothing
is one of the greatest composers of our time cine.<br /><br />And finally, the fifth - are actors. In my opinion, all participants
selected the film quite well and feeling miscasting I was not. DiCaprio
once again confirmed that organic looks at the role of tough guy, not
devoid of feeling and touching at the same time. Mariyon Cotillard,
personally frightened me with his eyes. Very insane person turned out
and very doomed. Strongly liked Watanabe - a typical ruling rich
Japanese. Samurai, his mother. The whole team looked retrievers in his
place. Even the young Ellen Page as Ariadne - an architect of
labyrinths (good joke turned out) looked good.<br /><br />As a result, to my taste and look closely, this is the most powerful
cinema&#x27;s impressions past ten years. This is more science fiction, and
therefore difficult to compare, for example, with brilliant comedy &#x22;
The Big Lebowski &#x27;or the political drama &#x22; Frost v. Nixon &#x22;and
historical drama&#x22; There will be blood &#x22;. But in its genre is the best
thing I&#x27;ve seen.<br /><br />My deepest recognition and Christopher Nolan bow. Long life. Create,
maestro.
