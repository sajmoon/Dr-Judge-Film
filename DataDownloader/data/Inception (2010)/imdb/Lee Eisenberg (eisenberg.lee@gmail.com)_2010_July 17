So far, Christopher Nolan has not disappointed me as a director, and
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is another good one. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, who
has the technology to enter people&#x27;s dreams to obtain secret
information. The climax comes when Cobb and his cohorts enter the dream
of an executive, going deeper and deeper into his subconscious.<br /><br />Despite the high action, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not really an action movie, but
more of a psychological thriller. The movie has a slightly nonlinear
plot, similar to &#x22;Memento&#x22; and &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;. This helps to stress the
dreamlike state that the movie depicts. If in fact the movie has any
problem, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to tell when the characters are
dreaming and when it&#x27;s real life. But on the other hand, this also
shows how smoothly Nolan lets the story flow. Watching the movie, I
came to realize things about my own dreams that I had never previously
thought about. The apparent descent into insanity and links to Cobb&#x27;s
past bring to mind &#x22;Insomnia&#x22;.<br /><br />Much like how Nolan put a new spin on the Batman franchise, &#x22;Inception&#x22;
takes psychological thrillers to the next step. It even goes beyond
&#x22;The Matrix&#x22;. All in all, I certainly recommend it.<br /><br />Also starring Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard,
Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger and
Michael Caine (who has so far starred in every one of Nolan&#x27;s movies
since &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;).
