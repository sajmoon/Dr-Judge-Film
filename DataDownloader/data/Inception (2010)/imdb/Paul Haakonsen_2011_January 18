I finally caved in to the hype about this movie and sat down to watch
it. And now I know what all the fuzz was about.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is simply put a groundbreaking movie for our times, just
like &#x22;Matrix&#x22; was back in 1999.<br /><br />The story told in &#x22;Inception&#x22; is very captivating and you get really
caught up in the events as they unfold. The story is the type that
grips you tight and takes you on one amazing thrill ride. I will not go
into depth about the actual storyline, but the notion about going into
another person&#x27;s subconscious and dreams is quite interesting. And
going in there to plant the seed of a new idea is even more
interesting. Enough said.<br /><br />As for the cast in &#x22;Inception&#x22;, well that was simply phenomenal. Lots
of really good performances done here, but of course, we are dealing
with good actors and established names here. Of course Leonardo
DiCaprio in the lead role as Cobb. I haven&#x27;t been much fond of his
previous work, but since &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;, he has really started to
become noticeable (for me at least). And his performance in &#x22;Inception&#x22;
was right on the money, very nice indeed. Of course, he wasn&#x27;t the sole
carrier of the movie, he was well helped along by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
playing Arthur, and he was really standing out on the screen. He did
such a super job with his character, and I think he was the one
actually carrying the heavy load of the movie. Then there was Ellen
Page, playing Ariadne, which was quite an interesting role to see her
in. Actually, the list goes on and on with really good actors here,
such as Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, and so on.<br /><br />What appealed to me about the movie was the concept of the entire
story. Of being able to go into a person&#x27;s mind and influence his
dreams and thoughts. However unlikely it may be, it still came off
quite nice on the screen.<br /><br />A movie like this is nothing without special effects. And &#x22;Inception&#x22;
sure had a bunch of really nice effects along the way. There were some
really mind-boggling CGI effects going on at places. And the effects
also had a huge part to do with the final outcome of the movie.<br /><br />Despite it being a rather long movie, the time does fly by as you watch
it, because you are so caught up in the story. And that was really
great, film-making when it is best; entertainment that makes you forget
all about time and space. And &#x22;Inception&#x22; is definitely a movie that
you need to get around to watch if you haven&#x27;t already seen it. This is
a movie that will redefine movie making in the future.<br /><br />Thumbs up, way up, for this impressive movie.
