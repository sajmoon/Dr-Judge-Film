2010_July 18 
I actually got to a movie yesterday - the second or third in over a
year at these prices ($12.95 for a Matin&#xE9;e in Manhattan!!!) and the
first that actually gave its full money&#x27;s worth - something called
INCEPTION with nicely understated work (in a very overstated movie)
from Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt guided by the well
promoted director, Christopher Nolan, of one of those awful Batman
films, DARK KNIGHT. This was MUCH better for broader (ie. older)
audiences. As a writer, Nolan has come up with a far subtler, better
developed idea than the oft cited by younger viewers MATRIX films, and
all in a single satisfying work.<br /><br />A lot of print critics, while raving about the new film, said it was
&#x22;hard to follow&#x22; (it&#x27;s a science fiction/caper film riffing on themes
first well touched on in DREAMSCAPE and PAYCHECK, ramping the concept
up several levels by taking the characters and the audience down three
or four levels within the guided dream/subconsciousness of the &#x22;mark&#x22;)
but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d trust the mental facilities of anyone who can&#x27;t
follow it. It&#x27;s most elegantly laid out if you have affection for the
science fiction or caper film genres and the wit to pay attention.<br /><br />It would be easy to want to resist anything this heavily designed with
such spectacular CGI effects (Paris folded over on itself, a freight
train turning up in the middle of a busy street or a hotel suddenly
going weightless) just because of those effects, but Nolan for the most
part keeps the mood and lighting light and even better, explains the
rules of his created worlds with meticulous care - and even calls his
characters when they violate the standards they have laid out (DiCaprio
has a complex back story revealed at the perfect pace through the
movie). It makes for a thrill ride for those who do pay attention and
give themselves over to the fantasy. INCEPTION will almost certainly
have its greatest impact on the big screen where the viewers can lose
themselves along with the characters in the visuals, but the plotting
is so elegant, I suspect it will still work in the inevitable video
release.<br /><br />The film is not flawless. The third level of mountain-top/dreamscape
&#x22;security&#x22; displays a certain failure of imagination and, while
exciting in a James Bond reminiscent way, isn&#x27;t entirely worthy of the
other levels of the puzzle. Further, the film DOES require the full
attention of the audience to catch all the meticulously placed clues
and explanations - especially in the opening which pays off fully near
the end and the justification of the &#x22;good guy&#x22; nature of the core
caper which is all too briefly dropped in mid-film. Stick around
through the credits for a full throated playing of the Piaf song used
so subtly and well in the film - there&#x27;s one final audio trick that&#x27;s a
perfect coda to the film.<br /><br />Still, it&#x27;s all there and the film is legitimately a thinking person&#x27;s
extravaganza. A sci-fi/caper film which challenges the giddy, Terry
Gilliam heights of a BARON MUNCHAUSEN visually and blissfully succeeds.
Don&#x27;t bother with it if you&#x27;re sleep deprived or have no patience for
puzzles, but if you like a good caper film (like the non-sci-fi Joseph
L. Mankiewicz HONEY POT or any of the more recent OCEAN&#x27;S... films) and
are willing to be challenged, this is a great summer treat.
