I went to see this movie because it had &#x3E;9 on IMDb, which historically
has always meant it was excellent, and DiCaprio has done quite a few
really good movies lately.<br /><br />Anyway, I was fairly bored with it, and though I followed it OK, being
a science nerd I found it had some flaws in the logic of how the dreams
were portrayed. I thought some parts (all the fighting in the snow)
were completely unnecessary to the plot and added just so the movie
would have more action.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed the movie wasn&#x27;t better, but I&#x27;m not saying
it was a bad movie, just boring and logically silly. The acting was all
great, some of the effects excellent, overall I was just like &#x22;meh&#x22;.
