I&#x27;m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan
couldn&#x27;t follow up to &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, he does it again, delivering
another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has
been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions
vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention
like an iron claw that you just can&#x27;t help watching and wondering what
will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No
wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a
director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the
film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate
like MANY films before.<br /><br />Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred
Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher
Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted
Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once
in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most
importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full
blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts
imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar
to the excellent anime film &#x22;Paprika&#x22; in the whole &#x22;invading dreams&#x22;
plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a
whole different level.<br /><br />Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same
time, it&#x27;s either all-visuals-no-smarts (&#x22;G.I. Joe&#x22;, &#x22;Transformers&#x22;) or
the exact opposite (&#x22;Doubt&#x22;, &#x22;Invictus&#x22;). In this film the excellently
directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and
jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of
intelligence and believability.<br /><br />Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant
studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he
wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you
get many glimpses of Nolan&#x27;s perplexing, increasingly imaginative
thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he
sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use
than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it
is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can&#x27;t explain the plot for fear of
spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin
the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed,
confused and ultimately breathless. It&#x27;s like a puzzle, both physically
and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the
clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful
not to let it overwhelm the film&#x27;s humanity, and this is where
&#x22;Inception&#x22; shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking
and asking questions for years to come. That&#x27;s right, years.<br /><br />Once the film ends, you&#x27;ll want to watch it again, for there&#x27;s
something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing
for someone to truly comprehend the film&#x27;s ambiguous themes, and will
be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no
adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely
refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual
effects roadshows (&#x22;Avatar&#x22; be damned).<br /><br />Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio
delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his
previous effort &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;. He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim,
fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can&#x27;t seem
to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom
Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas
Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely
talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.<br /><br />Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it
comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and
extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script
is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman
the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (&#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;).
The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent
from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping
towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The
visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not
bring down the movie&#x27;s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more
fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully
shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory.
Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and
locations. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s complementing music score is simply
outstanding, and knowing the man, that&#x27;s really all I have to say.
Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie
experience like no other this year.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted
filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And
&#x22;Inception&#x22; can proudly stand alongside &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; and &#x22;2001: A
Space Odyssey&#x22; as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries
for movie making and become a different experience altogether.<br /><br />There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the
intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes
together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that
rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the
planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010?
Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a
genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent
people.<br /><br />Missing this film and not getting the film&#x27;s point is a crime.<br /><br />Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)
