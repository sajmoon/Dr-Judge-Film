Inception isn&#x27;t for the faint-hearted. Don&#x27;t expect a story for
children.<br /><br />The story opens with a guy who&#x27;s plagued by a recurring nightmare, so
he seeks psychological help. If you&#x27;ve ever seen and enjoyed Animedom&#x27;s
PAPRIKA, it&#x27;ll help you understanding what&#x27;s going on in the film.<br /><br />The movie forms a relationship with Paprika, a dream character who
becomes his guide in helping him understand what happened in his past
that makes him feel such shame in the present. Paprika assumes many
forms in the everchanging dreamscape to relate to the other characters.<br /><br />In Paprika, this seems all good at the beginning, but the device that
enables dream analysis is stolen. This creates an even bigger problem
than just nightmares; what happens when people can&#x27;t control their
dreams and has them hijacked by evil? Paprika isn&#x27;t the easiest movie
to sum up. On one level, it&#x27;s like watching dreamy, fantastical
animation, but there&#x27;s also a deeper psychological question being
asked: What is a dream exactly and to what extent does it affect your
consciousness and waking life? How much fantasy is good for a person
whether it be in dreams or spending time on the Internet? If you bury
guilt and desire into your subconscious, how will it manifest in your
dreams? It is the same in &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />Paprika is definitely a visual spectacle. I don&#x27;t recommend waiting to
see it on video. I had the honor of catching it on the big screen,
which I believe is necessary to capture the depth of the imagery. Parts
of it really seemed like dreams I&#x27;ve had (times when I&#x27;ve tried to
walk, but couldn&#x27;t get anywhere and the harder I tried, the worse it
got).<br /><br />I put Paprika up there with Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth. Not Inception. A lot of
people will be turned off from it by the subtitles and another set of
people will be lost by the mythology in it. If you are not a retard and
have no problems with these kinds of things, you will probably have a
delightful viewing experience. As for Inception, it&#x27;s like candy for
the dumb dumb set.<br /><br />It takes a person with an analytical mind to put the plot together,
much less comprehend subtitles. If you follow the recurring images, the
mythology will make sense. A lot happens on the screen. My five year
old child didn&#x27;t have a problem understanding what was going on and we
enjoyed putting the puzzle together. I don&#x27;t think most moviegoers are
like that these days, so I can see them getting bored or annoyed
because they can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on. If you prefer the Disney
genre of animation, avoid Paprika, it will just frustrate you. If
you&#x27;re crave more than a simple plot, Paprika will satisfy that hunger.<br /><br />The soundtrack is quite good too. It&#x27;s a refreshing break from Elton
John power ballads.
