Inception is the best and most original film so far this year.
Writer/director Christopher Nolan has done it again given audiences
everything they could ever want or expect from one of these movies. An
intricate compelling story with plenty of spectacle, drama, and
exceptional performances by the great ensemble cast. Nolan has proved
with Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark
Knight his amazing talent as a filmmaker. This movie is no different.
It&#x27;s better to see Inception without knowing too much about the film.
Leonard DiCaprio continues to show why he&#x27;s one of Hollywood&#x27;s best
actors with his performance as Dom Cobb a dream thief or &#x22;Extractor&#x22;
who enters the dreams of others and steals ideas from their
subconscious. DiCaprio handles the emotional scenes very well and I
wanted to see his character succeed this difficult task of planting an
idea into someones mind instead of usually stealing one. The story of
him wanting to reunite with his children was very much the emotional
center which comes through in between the thrilling action sequences
that are truly one of a kind. Ken Watanabe is solid as the mysterious
businessman Saito &#x22;The Tourist&#x22; who offers Cobb the chance to get his
life back by pulling off the difficult task of inception. Wanatabe&#x27;s
accent was a little strong at first but I could understand him better
as the movie progressed you just have to listen carefully. Joseph
Gordon Levitt is very impressive as Arthur &#x22;The Point Man&#x22; who gathers
all the information on their &#x22;mark&#x22;. Gordon Levitt&#x27;s zero gravity
hallway fight may not last long but the scene is an amazing sight to
see on screen while it lasts. And the fact that he did most of it
himself shows his commitment as an actor. Well done. Marion Collitard
turns in a haunting performance as the projection of Cobb&#x27;s deceased
wife Mal making her somewhat dangerous yet sympathetic at times.
Collitard had nice chemistry with DiCaprio in their scenes together
making the love between their characters that much more believable.
Ellen Page is good as Adrianne &#x22;The Architect&#x22; who helps the team
create the dream world of their mark and navigate through that persons
mind. She held her own against her co-stars and turned in a convincing
performance. Tom Hardy is excellent as Eames &#x22;The Forger&#x22; who can
change his appearance in the dream world of someone close to the
&#x22;Mark.&#x22; I haven&#x27;t seen Hardy in much except the HBO miniseries Band of
Brothers but he&#x27;s very effective as Eames who can kick some serious ass
when he wants to. He also got some of the best lines in the movie which
he delivers perfectly. &#x22;I don&#x27;t know. Not sure. See if he starts
shooting at you. &#x22;You must not be afraid to dream a little bigger
darling.&#x22; Cillian Murphy shows he can play more than just villains as
Robert Fischer &#x22;The Mark&#x22; who tries to be like his father. Murphy
proves to be another great addition to the ensemble cast Nolan
assembled for this ambitious film. Tom Berenger does the best he can
with the small role of Fischer&#x27;s godfather Peter Browning. And Michael
Caine is a bit underused as Cobb&#x27;s father in law Miles who taught him
about dreams because his role is more of a cameo (considering he only
has two scenes one near the beginning and another at the very end) but
Caine is still effective as Miles none the less. The same can go for
Lucas Haas who makes a brief extended appearance as Cobb&#x27;s former
Architect Nash. He still does a good job with his small part in the
movie though. I honestly can&#x27;t think of one weak link in the entire
ensemble cast. The special effects are quite impressive which is used
to the films advantage because they felt realistic with cities folding
onto top of each other and slow motion shots that pulled you into the
imaginary dream worlds Nolan created for Inception. The action
sequences are crisp and thrilling with fist fights, gun battles, and
chases that are mostly in full view so you can see whats happening on
screen. The last hour or so is pretty much non-stop action but in a
good way with the characters entering dreams within dreams to pull off
their most challenging task yet Inception. In a summer of remakes and
sequels it was nice to see something original for a change. Overall I
can&#x27;t think of one thing I didn&#x27;t like about Inception. It&#x27;s definitely
the film to see and one not to be missed. So overall if you enjoy
movies like this you can&#x27;t go wrong with Inception. The pacing was fine
which made the 148 minute running time fly by fast. I didn&#x27;t once
wonder how much longer was left. It has an interesting story, some
character development (at least for Cobb), and drama while still being
packed with exhilarating action especially the second half. So go watch
this intelligent sci action thriller. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.
