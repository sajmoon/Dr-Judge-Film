A work of art. Inception was a true and smart sci-fi movie, with a
perfect cast, story, and possibly everything else. Definitely the best
of 2010. If you watch this the second time and pay attention more, you
can also understand a lot more, if you didn&#x27;t the first. My favorite
part would be the middle to the ending, being the whole dream, but
every second by whole, was just phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio was a
really good actor in this, so was everyone else, but I have seen him
like this in a lot of his other films. Other Actors really earned a
mark in this also, like Cillian Murphy, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Ellen
Page.<br /><br />Inception was also directed by Christopher Nolan, who also directed The
Dark Knight, Insomnia, and Following, which also hits near their
perfection. The music really gets you going, with the ongoing tune,
keeps you on screen. This movie really gets you thinking that doing
this can be real, and I really wish it was. If you haven&#x27;t watched this
movie and is reading this now, WATCH INCEPTION, or you&#x27;ll be stupid not
doing so.
