When Christopher Nolan first stated that he was taking a break from the
Batman franchise to make another original movie I must be honest in
saying that I was a little bit disappointed. Then as time went on I
still had no idea what this Christopher Nolan project was about, all I
had was the title &#x22;Inception&#x22;. Well that got me interested, what could
this mysterious project be about. Then a year went by and I all that
Christoper Nolan said was that it was a science fiction movie set
within the human mind; a statement that was confusing and slightly
annoying, giving the public literally no clue what the movie was
actually about. It was at this point that I pretty much became obsessed
with this movie, making sure I saw every trailer, every poster
absorbing every piece of info, finally about 2 months ago the final
trailer was released and we get to see the full premise of the movie,
but it was portrayed in such a way that the plot was still a complete
mystery. I had to see this movie!!! Now that I have seen the movie I
can not say that I am disappointed in the least. The amount of layers
in this story are so numerous that with the first viewing I could only
really scratch the surface, but my first impressions are that of
amazement and in all honesty confusion. The twist and turns keep your
eyes glued to the screen, and the idea of even taking a bathroom break
seemed ludicrous. I loved every single moment of this film and it will
be one that I will be able to watch over and over again without getting
tired of it, just like Chris Nolan&#x27;s last non- batman movie &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22;. This film was utterly astounding and I take my hat off to
Christopher Nolan for delivering yet another modern masterpiece!
