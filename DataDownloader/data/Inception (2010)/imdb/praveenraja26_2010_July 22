INCEPTION means the beginning but its not a start for Christopher
Nolan. It made him a legend for his mysterious screenplay played again
after the &#x22;MEMENTO&#x22; and excellent direction in his remarkable movie
&#x22;DARK KNIGHT&#x22;. But now the screenplay from memento and the direction
skills from dark knight to make a masterpiece &#x22;INCEPTION&#x22;. I really
loved the cinematography of the motion in the movie. The people who
would like to watch the movie should prepare themselves as they are
going to the examination. There is nothing wrong in telling the above
sentence why because the screenplay will make ourselves think hard
about the plot. I really think this movie as a riddle. If you are going
to watch it for first time you will be puzzled but the movie will take
you to the NOLAN&#x27;s DREAM where you cant find your way back to the
reality. Hans Zimmer has given a great background music which bring us
to the subject actually they dealing.<br /><br />Coming to the cast, they are really perfect. The performance by the
Leonardo Decaprio was really amazing. The cast make the scenes live.
After looking at the movie one can see Christopher Nolan mark in the
movie.<br /><br />The movie is all about a thief who stoles information for their clients
through a inception program. He was given a chance for his redemption.
The story will go on with how he done his inception for his redemption. <br /><br />The movie become so fictitious which makes some audience worried a
little bit. some people can&#x27;t know the movie story exactly even they
look at the movie more than TWICE. Some people who don&#x27;t like the movie
because they really can&#x27;t understand story line.<br /><br />&#x22;THE WHOLE MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT DREAMS WHICH MAKES THE NOLAN&#x27;s DREAM COME
TRUE&#x22;<br /><br />I really like the movie, about every thing but the undertaking of the
movie is excellent.
