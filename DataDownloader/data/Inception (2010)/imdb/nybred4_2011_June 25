I may be able to count on one hand how many good to excellent movies I
had zero questions about either during or after completion of the
movie. Things do get by me and I try to get my answer from those who
saw the flick with me, or online. Inception left me with one question.
&#x22;Did you get it?&#x22;<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t get it and I&#x27;ve a high degree of confidence that those
100,453,830 people who &#x27;got it&#x27;, had 100,453,830 versions of &#x27;gettin&#x27;.
I&#x27;ve got 2 teenage kids and a 23 year old. My kids and every SINGLE one
of their friends &#x27;got it&#x27;. If you do not yet know where this review is
going, you &#x27;got it&#x27;. Nuff said. Pick up the emperor&#x27;s clothes at the
dry cleaners tomorrow. His majesty&#x27;s clothes are ready and you
&#x22;Inception&#x22; fans are ready for your close-up. ROLL &#x27;EM!!!
