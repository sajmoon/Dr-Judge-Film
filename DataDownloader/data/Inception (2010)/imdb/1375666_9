What is going on with the IMDb user reviews lately? It&#x27;s like the
masses can no longer be trusted. In the last month, the users have
decreed &#x22;Airbender&#x22; the worst abomination ever, when in fact it&#x27;s just
an average movie. User reviews raved over &#x22;Despicable Me&#x22;, when it was
about as entertaining as a &#x22;Dexter&#x27;s Lab&#x22; rerun. And now? &#x22;Inception&#x22;
is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very
creative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The
problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a
dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they&#x27;re
dreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner
or later you stop caring about the actual action because it&#x27;s a dream.
So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the
pouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a
ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what&#x27;s-his-name float
around a hotel just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd
greatest movie ever? You must be dreaming.
