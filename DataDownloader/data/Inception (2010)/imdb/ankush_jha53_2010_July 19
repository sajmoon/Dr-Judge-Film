As a great movie it has got it all. A mission which looks almost
impossible, a hero who&#x27;s tormented with his guilt and regrets, A story
which keeps the intrigue, Action which keeps adrenaline rushing,
assembling a interesting supporting team,like in &#x22;oceans&#x22; which keeps
the momentum going and a conclusion which leaves you with a smile and
some un-answered questions.<br /><br />Nolan sure has grown a lot in his ability to take such a complicated
plot and present it so simply since Memento and The Prestige. It must
have been an herculean task to draw a narrative of a complex plot into
a multi-layer screenplay. <br /><br />if someone asks to narrate the story of this movie there will not be
much to say about that, for this movie is all about experiencing it
first hand. It was only possible through intelligent choice of such
stark different settings for different levels of dreams. A warehouse
with raining outside then in a hotel with loss of gravity and finally
into the mountains.<br /><br />Intelligent projection such as &#x22;the fall of van from the bridge causing
zero-gravity in the next level of dream in the hotel&#x22; and &#x22;using the
principle of weightlessness of free fall of lift to create gravity like
effect&#x22; were just awesome. at the same time it was inconsistent. why
zero-gravity effect doesn&#x27;t affect the next level of dreams.<br /><br />though at some points it tries desperately to seem intelligent showing
top spinning in the end. just like Scorsese did it in &#x22;shutter island&#x22;.<br /><br />the magnitude of production was just awesome. some scenes were just too
great. when Ariadne starts playing with physical laws. when dream
starts falling apart. and when van is racing and toppling and when it
finally lands safe.<br /><br />finally a spoilsport: Matrix still remains the best movie as far as
intelligence is concerned.
