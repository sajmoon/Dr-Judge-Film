Empathy turns out to be the biggest challenge that filmmaker
Christopher Nolan faces in his audaciously intricate, sometimes
confounding 2010 sci-fi action thriller. It&#x27;s a 148-minute somersault
of a ride viscerally engaging in its vivid elaboration of lucid
dreaming. Ironically, there is little time to feel for the characters
involved when the whole point of the movie is that nothing is meant to
feel real. This dramatic dilemma is almost completely shouldered by the
main protagonist Dom Cobb, a professional thief specializing in
corporate espionage whose sharpened gifts as an &#x22;extractor&#x22; allows him
to enter the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise
inaccessible. Heading up a &#x22;Mission: Impossible&#x22;-type task force, Cobb
has become a &#x22;Shane&#x22;-like solitary figure whose talents have cost him
his family. He wants nothing more than to see the faces of his two
young children.<br /><br />The movie wastes no time in giving Cobb a final mission, his one last
shot at redemption which will allow him to reunite with his family back
in the states. A Japanese tycoon named Saito wants Cobb to perform an
act of &#x22;inception&#x22; in which he would plant an idea in the subconscious
of Robert Fischer Jr., the son of a corporate rival who is about to
inherit his father&#x27;s energy conglomerate. Saito wants Fischer to
dissolve the company to prevent the corporation&#x27;s inevitable takeover
of global energy resources, but Cobb&#x27;s participation represents a risky
maneuver that conjures up memories of his dead wife Mal. She figures in
the dream episodes in unexpected ways that invariably cloud Cobb&#x27;s
judgment in executing upon the mission for Saito. A crack team has been
assembled to aid Cobb - Arthur, the point man who researches the
targets whose dreams will be infiltrated; Eames, a cocky forger who has
the ability to change identities inside dreams; Yusuf, a chemist who
has developed the powerful sedatives that take Cobb and crew into the
dream state; and Ariadne, a preternaturally talented graduate student
whom Cobb and Arthur train as their new architect.<br /><br />As both writer and director, Nolan methodically bends the storyline
into a labyrinth that turns out to be circular in structure and
contains at least four layers of dreams in which the task force must
tag team in order to wake up to the next higher level until they each
face reality. This is easier said than done since he attempts to show
the unconscious as a supremely unruly place where nothing ultimately
makes sense, and that&#x27;s the film&#x27;s major conundrum since it demands
that the narrative must make some amount of sense to make the viewer
feel engaged with the story being told. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his
trademark intensity to Dom and manages a gravitas that helps ground the
story at a human level, even when the plot convolutions get more and
more elaborate and far-fetched. There are some impressive CGI
set-pieces like the street of Paris folding over like an omelet, a
train careening down a busy downtown street, and the eerie sight of a
vacant city in a virtual limbo. Other scenes border on the silly like
Arthur&#x27;s fight scene amid a rotating hotel that make him look like he&#x27;s
doing a &#x22;2001&#x22; riff on Fred Astaire&#x27;s classic dance routine in &#x22;Royal
Wedding&#x22;, or the way Ariadne precociously diagnoses the solutions to
fatalistic dreams like an worldly scholar.<br /><br />By no means does the approach translate into ineffectual performances
by the rest of the eclectic cast. It&#x27;s just that the actors reflect the
generally poker-faced manner expected within the sci-fi genre. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt (&#x22;500 Days of Summer&#x22;) plays Arthur just that way as does
Ken Watanabe (&#x22;The Last Samurai&#x22;) appropriately inscrutable as Saito.
Ellen Page (&#x22;Juno&#x22;) neutralizes her naturally sardonic manner to play
up Ariadne&#x27;s na&#xEF;ve curiosity, but to her defense, she has some of the
clunkiest dialogue to deliver. Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao fare better as
Eames and Yusuf, respectively simply because they play plot devices
more than people. Cillian Murphy (&#x22;Breakfast on Pluto&#x22;) channels his
usually intimidating intensity into Fischer&#x27;s deceptively becalming
manner, while an almost unrecognizable Tom Berenger manages to play his
father&#x27;s loyal associate with welcome gusto. As Mal, Marion Cotillard
(&#x22;La Vie en Rose&#x22;) has by far the film&#x27;s most challenging role,
maintaining a careful balance between a spectral figure of longing for
Cobb and a manipulative femme fatale.<br /><br />As one would expect from a Nolan film, all the production details are
exquisite. Wally Pfister&#x27;s astonishing cinematography contributes
immeasurably to the film&#x27;s overall hypnotic effect, and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
foreboding, percussive score thrusts the drama forward with momentum.
This movie is too startling a work to ignore, but it would be
disingenuous to say that this venture reflects a grand vision since the
story is basically an elaborate heist movie. Everything is so well
thought out that Nolan may have inadvertently prevented his audience
from feeling the full emotional impact of the ending despite the superb
editing job by Lee Smith that juggles all the concurrent dreams
together. This is still masterful filmmaking from someone who could
have focused a tad less on technique and a tad more on the untamed
heart that really alters the order within our dreams.
