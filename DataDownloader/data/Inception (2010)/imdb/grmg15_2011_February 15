&#x22;Inception&#x22; is possibly one of the best movies of the decade. When I
say that, I don&#x27;t mean extremely artsy or emotional, or a movie that
attempts to get a reaction out of the audience by toying with current
social issues. It&#x27;s a movie that was precariously thought over for
years, and then put together with an amazing cast, a thoughtful,
original storyline, and stunning visuals. To complain that the story is
too complex is ridiculous; It makes you pay attention, and somehow
people perceive that as a bad thing. Christopher Nolan (the director)
was not attempting to make his movie as complicated as possible to make
it a great movie; &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a great movie because is has more
depth than movies like &#x22;Avatar&#x22; and &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;. <br /><br />The people that I know that disliked this movie (which was very few)
typically didn&#x27;t like it because of its &#x22;loudness&#x22;, as in explosions
and action sequences, and because it was &#x22;confusing&#x22;.<br /><br />Overall, there is little reason to not like this movie, let alone give
it one star (what are you people thinking? You really think that this
movie is a complete and utter failure!?). Like Cobb said, &#x22;They say we
only use a fraction of our brain&#x27;s true potential. Now that&#x27;s when
we&#x27;re awake. When we&#x27;re asleep, we can do almost anything&#x22;. Maybe the
people who dislike this movie need to watch is while asleep, to fully
activate their thinking potential.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is simply a very well-rounded, utterly brilliant movie that
will bring you into a world of folding cities and twisting hallways.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; will bring you in and fill your head with its complexity
and perfection, and may even plant an idea inside of you, so be ready,
because in &#x22;Inception&#x22;, your mind is the scene of the crime.
