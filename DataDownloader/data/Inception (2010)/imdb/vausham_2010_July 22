Someone with the caliber of directing Memento and dark knight; Someone
who can make his movies remembered by giving strong characters to his
movies like Joker in Dark Knight; Someone who is known for creating
interesting plot and then utilizing it to his best; Someone from which
you didn&#x27;t expected a average film, has done it this time.<br /><br />The movie is average in all aspects. The plot was not original, being
made on the same idea as Abre los Ojos and Vanilla sky. The acting in
the movie was average. There is not even one strong character that
comes out of the movie, be it Leonardo himself. The plot made was never
utilized fully. It was as if everything was going in one direction, the
direction everyone knew.<br /><br />To me it was an average movie, something i can watch if there is
nothing else to do.
