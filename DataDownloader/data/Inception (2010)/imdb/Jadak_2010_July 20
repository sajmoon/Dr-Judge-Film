I went with a high expectation, having heard words of description of
Memento and Matrix. In my mind those are both excellent movies that
really push you mentally to stay with them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me it just wasn&#x27;t even in the same league. The story
was simple, this is a good thing as there is something required to help
keep you grounded as all of the plot twists start pouring in from all
over the place...well that was the expectation, the plot was incredibly
linear with no real twists, in short nothing surprised me. Anywhere
that was setting me up to think had a character explain away the
potential challenge and it became a sit back and it will all be
explained.<br /><br />It was probably entertaining enough, I got bored of all of the action
and was actually concerned that my wife was becoming bored of what I
had sold as a mind bender, actually was just guns and bombs and guns
and bombs. It was too excessive, with no respite.<br /><br />The visuals were stunning, the concept fascinating, the acting good,
the plot linear by comparison to the movies that are being mentioned in
the same sentence.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t see it again unless it&#x27;s on TV one day and I have nothing else
to do. Worth seeing once, just expect a normal movie, and you&#x27;ll
probably enjoy it. This does not have the legs of the Matrix, Memento
or the Departed.
