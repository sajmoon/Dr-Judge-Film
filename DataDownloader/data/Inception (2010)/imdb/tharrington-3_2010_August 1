Let me begin by saying that Inception is not bad, but it certainly
isn&#x27;t great. Nolan&#x27;s script fails in multiple areas that harm the film
significantly.<br /><br />1. The characterization is mediocre. Most of the members of the team
are one-note, shallow and uninteresting. This greatly hampers your
emotional attachment to the film and prevents you from caring about the
outcome. Compared to the intense and complex characters of The
Prestige, Insomnia, and Memento, the cast of Inception appears to be
mostly slick suits walking around and doing things.<br /><br />2. The grandiose themes and interesting concepts that existed in The
Dark Knight or Batman Begins are nowhere to be found here. Terrorism,
corruption, or duty are ignored for love (which is dealt with in some
of the most trite dialogue ever).<br /><br />3. The plot is too twisty for it&#x27;s own good, resulting in you
appreciating it less as a film and more as a puzzle. Vaguity does not
equal genius, contrary to many critic&#x27;s beliefs.<br /><br />In conclusion, Inception is a visually stunning film with aspirations
at being significant, but it fails. Is it a thoughtful blockbuster?
Yes. Is it the worst film Nolan has ever made? Absolutely. Should you
watch it? Yes.
