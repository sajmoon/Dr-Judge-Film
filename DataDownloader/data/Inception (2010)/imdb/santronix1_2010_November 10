This movie is excellent amongst all the movies I have ever seen! Being
an avid fan of Hollywood movies, I couldn&#x27;t have missed this movie! It
is mind blowing...perfect and has a lot of sense! After watching this
movie I even felt that the movie is still revolving around me like
Cobb&#x27;s totem! A must watch! 10 out of 10!<br /><br />People even said to me that we need to watch this movie multiple times
in order to understand it&#x27;s subject depth, but I could really feel it&#x27;s
simplicity within a complexity in the first watch!<br /><br />But of course, you can not hold yourself back watching it again and
again!
