The story of this movie is about a highly skilled man in the &#x22;art&#x22; of
dream invasion. Somewhere in the future and with some unspecified
technology, people can enter each others&#x27; dreams. The main character is
a thief in those dreams but he needs a crew to do it. When the chance
of going back home (He was extradited) in exchange for one job
presented, he took it right away. The problem is that he is somewhat
haunted by his past and that may interfere with his last assignment.<br /><br />It is difficult to give this movie a bad rating because it is a great
movie. Nonetheless, its current position as the number 4 of the &#x22;IMDb&#x27;s
top 250&#x22; seems exaggerated. I have no doubt that its position will drop
down in a few weeks so I will give it a good score too.<br /><br />The reason I believe its current position is undeserved is because of
its many flaws, but we will get there later. First lets discuss its
positive aspects. One of the good things it has is its plot. It is not
very complicated, but not so average either. It develops itself in such
smooth way that you feel involved. Obviously the performances of the
actors help a lot. The cast was superb and everyone stands out. But I
think Di Caprio deserves a special mention. He became a very talented
actor. After some average movies around the year 2000, nobody would
claim he was as good as he is now. He has done some excellent choices
and now is considered as a top class actor.<br /><br />The technical part of this film was great also. From the score to the
photography everything was really good. The special effects were very
well polished and very impressive. All those details contributed in the
final product.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are many negative things about it. For
example, it has many contradictions. One of them is about the method of
waking up. It is stated that people wake up when they fall or when they
touch water, but in some part of the movie the characters were falling
into the water but woke up when they touched it (They were falling
first, so they should have been already up right?).<br /><br />Other example would be the &#x22;dying&#x22; rule. If you die in a dream you wake
up, except for the final job. Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be dramatic right?
It seems like the rules apply only when it&#x27;s convenient, and I didn&#x27;t
like that. The last thing that I didn&#x27;t enjoyed was its length. Some
scenes were useless to me, specially the ones in the beginning.<br /><br />To finish this review I will recommend this title since it is very
entertaining despite its flaws. It has some great scenes with some
great actors and everyone will enjoy it.
