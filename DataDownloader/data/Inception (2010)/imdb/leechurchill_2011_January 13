It may be just my preference, but I don&#x27;t care for films that seem to
start in the third act and never seem to leave it.<br /><br />I usually like the films of DiCaprio. I think he&#x27;s a convincing actor.
And I do appreciate the production values. But I found the constant,
ominous background music cloying at times. This film is hard to get
into at first, and unfortunately doesn&#x27;t get any easier as time goes
on. Unlike most films that seem to start at the end, then the remaining
film is spent retroactively, filling in how everyone got there, this
film just continues to twist the viewer around without mercy. Sorry,
but I like to relax when I watch a movie.<br /><br />I realize, the dream scape can be ambiguous, but I would have rather
spent this 2.5 hours weaving my own, eyes closed, in bed. Z Z Z Z
