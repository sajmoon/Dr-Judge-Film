I have some advice for intelligent people who wish to see a great film
about dreams...Watch Mulholland Dr. Instead.<br /><br />I found Inception to be a strange animal, it&#x27;s almost like a film that
has been aimed at cretins to help them feel as though they are
intelligent.<br /><br />As far as having my mind blown I found myself still waiting for the
&#x22;Blow&#x22; as the film wrapped, following two and a half hours of dull
exposition, lacklustre performances, and clich&#xE9; after clich&#xE9; all
dressed up as the &#x22;next big thing&#x22;.<br /><br />I am by no means a &#x22;Nolan hater&#x22; he has made some very solid films up
to this point and has real talent, I also do not blame him for this
offering as he obviously thought it was good, I blame the easily
pleased and intellectually challenged people who have hyped it up to be
something it clearly is not.<br /><br />The 3rd greatest film of all time?...Give me a break.
