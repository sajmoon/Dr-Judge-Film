Inception is the Best movie i have seen till date. It pushed LOTR
trilogy to 2nd place in my Top movies list. After seeing the movie,
more than anything else, i was amazed by the incredible imagination and
direction of Nolan.<br /><br />This is without doubt the most complex script i have ever seen.
In-spite of its complexity, Nolan has directed and presented so
brilliantly that it is understandable to the viewers.<br /><br />In short, after July-16, Nolan has set a benchmark in imagination and
direction through &#x22;Inception&#x22; in world cinema. Watch it to believe it
and to go into the Dreamworld of Nolan!
