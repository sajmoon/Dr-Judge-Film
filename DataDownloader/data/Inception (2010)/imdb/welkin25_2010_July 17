Well, I know when I utter the words &#x22;plot hole&#x22;, my friends will ask me
whether I have heard of &#x22;suspension of disbelief&#x22;. In a lot of movies I
am (really?) willing to overlook occasional incongruent details or fill
in the gaps just for the pure enjoyment, but unfortunately, Inception
is not one of those movies, and it suffered because it was unable to
weave together a convincing tale for me.<br /><br />Why? Because the very thing that holds this movie together IS the
complexity and ingenuity of layering out subconsciousness. It was
*supposed* to be clever, believable for some far distant future, it was
supposed to be something that challenges the viewer to question
reality... or at least so was my expectation, especially after seeing
such high scores on IMDb and RottenTomatoes.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I couldn&#x27;t help but try to unravel the over-
convoluted plot, which was thrown at the viewer so quickly and so
conclusively, moving right off to the next thing before the viewer had
a breath to digest exactly what had been fed to them, so as to sweep
any unpleasant signs of discrepancy or contradiction under the rug.
Trying to figure out exactly what is happening and why certain things
are so turned out to be a mistake, because answering questions only led
to even more questions and that certainly was a point of distraction
for me.<br /><br />In short, as the title of this review says, it was no Matrix (and I&#x27;m
only speaking of the 1999 movie, forget the sequels). Perhaps it had
tried to be, certainly now, 11 years later, this duality between
reality and mind is no longer as novel as what it had been at the time
of Matrix, so maybe they tried to compensate for this by complicating
things up, you know, the &#x22;hey, if this isn&#x27;t new, I&#x27;m sure compounding
this by X times is!&#x22; idea. But it looked like that was just too much
for them to handle with a handful of plot holes, loose ends not well
tied up, etc etc. And when the plot holes reside in the crux of the
story, if one were to generously overlook those... well, there just
won&#x27;t be very much else left.<br /><br />I am sorry to be so critical, but just as I&#x27;d expect great fighting
scenes from an action flick, great chemistry from a romance, when a
movie like Inception is pivoted in virtual reality -- in fact, virtual
reality so real that it fools the characters within the movie, well, it
better be very convincing for me too.<br /><br />On the positive side, I definitely enjoyed the special effects, the
cinematography was very well done, and the entire cast did an excellent
job at acting. So yeah, if you are good with letting go of your
rational logic self and not caring too much about the what&#x27;s and why&#x27;s
and how&#x27;s, then this movie will certainly take you on a very exciting
ride. Just, it&#x27;s not my cup of tea.
