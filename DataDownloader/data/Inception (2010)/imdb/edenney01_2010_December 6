The title says it all, if you&#x27;ve seen both movies you&#x27;ll have a good
feeling for what to expect.<br /><br />I have a tendency to pick apart unrealistic details in movies, so I
kind of liked the fact that the entire premise of the movie was
unrealistic with today&#x27;s technology. It forces you to accept the
reality that with specialized equipment and training, a person could
construct an entire dream world, and bring others into that world
without their knowledge. I didn&#x27;t have to waste any time or effort
picking apart what was plausible or implausible, I could just enjoy the
movie and go along for the ride, much like the Matrix.<br /><br />The ride itself is a wild one, and most of the movie is non-stop action
and intrigue. The special effects are top notch of course, which is to
be expected from a movie that is going to incorporate a heavy mix of
CGI, blue screen, and wire work. The largely unknown cast does a worthy
job, and DeCaprio does some of his finest work to date. Overall it&#x27;s a
fun, enjoyable movie, with a very unusual premise. Take a couple hours
out from reality to watch it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!
