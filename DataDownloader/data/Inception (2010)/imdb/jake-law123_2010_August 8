Although considered a more complicated Matrix, this film has a lot more
to hand us than it, such as a plot 10x more complicating from the
beginning, and getting more and more complicating, tremendous
performances by DiCaprio, Levitt, and Page, and excellent effects.<br /><br />This movie goes quite further into the story than most films, dealing
with peoples dreams, subconscious&#x27;s, and emotions. Only someone like
Nolan would create something like this, especially after the movie
Memento, and the Dark Knight. Of course quite lengthy, it still manages
to go through with the story as planned without getting things in the
way. Right at the beginning, I was immediately confused, but as the
movie goes through, things get explained and leave you positive.<br /><br />Leo DiCaprio plays an experienced thief named Cob, who lives in a world
where the technology to go into people&#x27;s dreams exist. He, along with
six other people use the device known as Inception to enter the dreams
of each other to gain intelligence to save their world. Going deeper
and deeper and deeper, their always on their toes to make it out alive.<br /><br />Like I said, the movie is quite confusing, since it starts off the plot
soon. There&#x27;s a lot more to go into, of course, such as the conditions
required. The characters are all likable, it was tough to choose which
one I like the most. You would think I like DiCaprio, but I honestly
like Levitt&#x27;s character the best. Not just because he&#x27;s pretty awesome
in that film, but also because he&#x27;s Roger from Angels in the Outfield.<br /><br />From beginning to end, your always on edge, trying to learn and get
everything. It will defiantly be hard to keep up with the plot, but it
will all be solved soon. Its a movie you really need to see twice. The
first time, to understand the concept, and the second time to just
enjoy the film. I appreciated the editing job they put into this, by
making it so dramatic and intense, helped out by Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music
score.<br /><br />Although long, it kinda has to be to fit the quality of the moments. It
really doesn&#x27;t have any pointless scenes. Every scene just about
contributes to the plot in anyway. But don&#x27;t get me wrong, it still
manages to keep its cool on the ground level, but even for a well
edited film, it still takes awhile. The plot starts off well, but the
movie itself takes awhile, and by that I mean the time.<br /><br />One of Nolan&#x27;s greatest films by far and one of the best blockbusters
of this summer!
