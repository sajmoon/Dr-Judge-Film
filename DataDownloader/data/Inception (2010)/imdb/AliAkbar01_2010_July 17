Inceptions, seeing a vision, watching the impossible happen.
Christopher Nolan really amazed us all by making this movie, after the
prestige and the dark knight; i really didn&#x27;t know how this director is
going to surprise us next time&#x85; Inception is not only the best in
matter of suspense but it is one of his finest work till now. Nolan has
the art of seeing he has a vision and even he is aware that some of the
scenes of the movie were nearly impossible to create but even to
imagine he put his limits and our patients to the max.<br /><br />The story of the movie is typically himself rich and full of excitement
and not only he surpassed himself but he made us believe in his own
universe in his own head he made us believed to Inception which he made
with such art and passion.<br /><br />When the casting was first selected, i was amazed to see hi m assemble
these fine actors in a one movie, Leonardo Dicaprio, Marion Cotillard,
Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe Joseph Gordon Levitt, this is perhaps the best
acting group ensemble ever! The way these actor&#x27;s were portrayed on
screen was phenomenal, Nolan as always the art of choosing the actors
he has this talent and this acting ensemble was not the exception.<br /><br />Dicaprio was the perfect actor to play Don Cobb he was satisfyingly
good and typically himself after Shutter Island he proved that he can
make us believe in him twice. Marion Cotillard as always is beautiful
and ardent her work is fabulous she is a real keeper. Since she has won
one of these gold trophies she can&#x27;t stop to amaze me she is an actress
of caliber and she is here to stay. Ellen Page was immensely out of her
element the vulgar and witty brat we saw in Juno is growing up and
flourishing really well. Ken Watanabe was enormously good he cant stop
to deliver non-stop great acting he was touching the perfection. Joseph
Gordon Levitt his everywhere nowadays from comedies like 500 days of
summer to action packed movie&#x27;s like G.I Joe is really proving himself
well.<br /><br />Overall Inception is a crazy world the world of a visionary the world
of a director but most importantly the world of someone who is not
scared of pushing the limits. With the industry&#x27;s finest actors and
with an imaginary director Inception not only push our limits to the
infinite but also make us believe in this crazy world of mystery and
thrill. I am giving it a 10/10 perfect note.
