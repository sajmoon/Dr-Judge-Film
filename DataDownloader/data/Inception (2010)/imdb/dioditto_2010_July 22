2010_July 22 
I have waited this movie since it was announced last year, and I guess
the expectation really just builds up.<br /><br />The movie had borrowed heavily from the cult classics such as
&#x22;eXistenZ&#x22;, &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, &#x22;Dark City&#x22;, and the most recent &#x22;Shutter
Island&#x22;.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, I thought the movie was generally great, the
actings were decent, and the special effects were awe-inspiring. But
the ending was quite clich&#xE9; - something unexpected from such acclaimed
director. Make no mistake, I am Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biggest fan, and I
have watched every one of his movies since his first commercial success
&#x22;Momento&#x22;. So, with that being said, I found the movie had some weird
and awkward cuttings between the scenes, it made it feel like very
sloppy editing job. Pacing was a bit off at the end too - it was
dragging on for too long. <br /><br />All in all, 7/10 for me.
