Inception is a movie that needs to be watched without being distracted
or disturbed by others. Because it is that complicated the 1st time you
watch it. The first time I watched it, it was so complicated, I had to
watch it a second time. In the end, I bought the DVD and decided to
watch it everyday, just so I could understand the concept and the movie
itself. Finally I come to a conclusion that this is by far the smartest
movie script and idea to ever come up in recent years.<br /><br />The movie concept is based on dreams. I can&#x27;t actually tell you the
plot, but the movie involves lots of twists and turns that you might
not want to know, until you&#x27;ve watched the movie.<br /><br />I have to give extra credit to the special effects team, for creating a
visual treat, and for the sound crew. Watching Inception in an IMAX
theater, you will get blown away.<br /><br />I will give this movie a full mark, because of the brilliant acting
skills of Leonardo DiCaprio, the well direction of Christopher Nolen,
and because of this new concept.<br /><br />This is truly a masterpiece to be enjoyed.
