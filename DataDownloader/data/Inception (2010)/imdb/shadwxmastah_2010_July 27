The actors were exceptional, playing their roles with 100% adamant
skill creating a killer cast which helped propel the movies momentum as
it was hyped and psyched up prior to release.<br /><br />Upon watching the movie, each minute was a blast as much as a puzzle
itself! thinking was imminent and necessary, hardly giving you time to
lean back and take a bite of your popcorn. This movie isn&#x27;t for you and
your girlfriend to be all touchy in, but take her along if she&#x27;s
interested into movies which get your mind going like a maths test!
Come to think about it, you can sort of see matrix through the backbone
of the movie but it is clearly magical none the less! The action scenes
were perfectly timed, making it adequate rather than over-done and time
consuming. The dialog, which i believe is a VERY important factor to
movie success, surpassed me, blowing my mind away at every moment.
Leonardo DiCaprio has been on a true roll with a back to back spree
with &#x22;shutter island&#x22; and now this, living up to audience expectations
with his acting.<br /><br />Mind blowing action scenes, intellectually battering dialog, talented
actors and a plot with a very imaginative basis and you get THE TOP
MOVIE this year, INCEPTION. I recommend it to all, unless it&#x27;s hard for
you to understand complicated movies.
