I like good sci fi movies. This is not a good one. The plot was
predictable. There was nothing unexpected. There is constant violence
at every dream level. Why does every dream have to be about running
from an army of thoughtless killers or assaulting a heavily defended
alpine military outpost for no apparent reason? The &#x27;architect&#x27; has
little direct and obvious impact. She really was just a counselor for
the star, or just wanted to throw in a &#x27;pretty face&#x27; for the obvious
and demeaning task of window dressing. They should have had her kick
some butt if they were going to have a 2 hour gun battle. The special
effects were far from spectacular. The star cast is great and they did
what they could with what little they were given. They could not
overcome the weaknesses.
