Firstly this movie is about dreamworld, where everything is possible,
like Matrix but other way. Plot is very well written and done on
screen, made me watch few times before I realized everything.<br /><br />It&#x27;s like a movie you want to see alone, so you could somehow keep up
with the story. Lucid dreams came to my mind almost in the beginning,
it kept my interest in the film.<br /><br />I felt like I&#x27;m watching two movies at the same time, no actual
characters that you could get similar to, that was maybe good, movie
itself was already confusing enough.<br /><br />The end-part was so boring that I almost fell asleep, very well done
though :)<br /><br />Final inception, I liked the theme and the movie, only thing I missed
was something that get similar to. Dream in a dream etc. wasn&#x27;t exactly
my normal dreaming.<br /><br />9/10
