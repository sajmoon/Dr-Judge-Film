Watch out - the amount of intelligent scriptwriting you accredit this
funny movie with may be surprisingly linear to the lack of simple
scientific knowledge and common sense you might possess!<br /><br />I simply CAN NOT believe that this movie has a 9.1 rating on IMDb. It
makes me question a) the people or b) people who take time to write
reviews. This is actually my first comment here and its catalyzed by
the imposing will to set one thing straight: It is an absolutely
average Hollywood flick and the first that made me question Leo&#x27;s
decision. I became a fan of this excellent acting in the recent years
but it was actually painful to listen to the randomly pulled together
pseudo-scientific plot. If you know anything about what they try to
make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the
good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has
it&#x27;s moments but I couldn&#x27;t &#x22;enjoy&#x22; it until the last hour.<br /><br />Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea,
believe it and be drawn into it. And there seems to be nothing else
worth watching right now - unless you check some aspiring independent
movies.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t watch it if you like sci-fi that is believable and passionate.
This one is one lame attempt -or just a blown up money grab. As
overrated as Batman.
