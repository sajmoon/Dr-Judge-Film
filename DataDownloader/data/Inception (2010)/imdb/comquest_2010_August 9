After several weeks of hearing praise about Inception from friends,
critics, and glowing reviews on IMDb, I finally gave in and took my
wife to see it this weekend. I really wanted to love this movie as I am
a huge fan of most Sci-Fi and Ellen Page. My wife usually loves
Leonardo and Ellen.<br /><br />We could not have been more disappointed with this train wreck of a
movie. We were both bored and ready to leave the theater after the
first 45 minutes but stuck it out till the end hoping for something
good that never came. We agreed that it was one of the WORST films we
have ever seen in our lifetimes.<br /><br />Yes - we did GET the gist of the convoluted plot, but the dialog and
visuals were at times laughable and silly as Christopher Nolan
force-fed the audience with course after course of nonsensical
explanations of how dreams work, their layers, and the non-specific
techniques the poorly defined characters would use for &#x22;extraction&#x22; and
their &#x22;inception&#x22; caper.<br /><br />I felt zero attachment to any of the characters in the story and didn&#x27;t
much care about their fate. If you&#x27;ve seen the trailer you&#x27;ve seen ALL
of the cool special effects nearly in their entirety. The
much-ballyhooed scenes that involve floating people were just
ripped-off variations of similar scenes from The Matrix series.<br /><br />The only explanation I have for the popularity of Inception is my
theory that more than 70% of theater audiences fell asleep during the
first 10 minutes and dreamed that they saw a good film.<br /><br />If you want to experience excitement in dreams, just lay down and take
a nap. Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned cash on this boring mess.
