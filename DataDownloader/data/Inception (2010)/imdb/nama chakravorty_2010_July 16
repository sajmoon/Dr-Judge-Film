Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x27;Inception&#x27; is amongst the Best Films Ever Made!
Usually, films have their share of minuses and flaws... surprise,
surprise, surprise, &#x27;Inception&#x27; is the first film since &#x27;The Shawshank
Redemption&#x27; that stabs words like &#x22;Flaw&#x22; and &#x22;Minus&#x22;! <br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s lucid dream is brought to life with &#x27;Inception&#x27;. What happens
when you enter the World of Dreams and it&#x27;s motives, is so unusual, so
interesting, so gripping and so amazing... that your left asking for
more. By now, you know what this Masterstorke is about, but believe
me... you have no idea what&#x27;s in store for you! &#x27;Inception&#x27; grabs your
attention from the very start, and as mentioned before, leaves you
awe-struck. And yes, &#x27;Inception&#x27; packs in THE Best Climax Ever! It&#x27;s
simply astounding!!<br /><br />Nolan makes his careers best film in &#x27;Inception&#x27;. His screenplay is
EPIC, and his direction should land him an Academy-Award for Best
Director! Wally Pfister&#x27;s cinematography is sure to compliment him with
numerous awards in the coming time. Music by Hans Zimmer, as always, is
perfect.<br /><br />Each and Every Actor excels over-here: Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead
and steals the show. The star-actor becomes Dom Cobb, and delivers a
memorable performance. Ellen Page is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is
magnificent. Michael Caine, in a brief role, is flawless. Tom Hardy is
very good, this is his best performance to date. Joseph Gordon-Levitt
gets a role of a lifetime, and he sinks his teeth into it. Ken Watanabe
is stylish, while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient. Tom Berenger is
perfect. Dileep Rao is good.<br /><br />On the whole, Nolan&#x27;s &#x27;Inception&#x27; is worth your time and money. Let me
put it this way: &#x22;If your a Cinema-Fan, than watching &#x27;Inception&#x27; is a
must&#x22;! Two Big Thumbs Up!
