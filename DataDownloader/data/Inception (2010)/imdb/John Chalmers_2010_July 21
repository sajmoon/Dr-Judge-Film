Inception, as if the other 85 reviewer&#x27;s opinions haven&#x27;t influenced
you, is amazing. There really are very few positive words you could use
that would even come close to describing what a triumph this movie is
for Leo DiCaprio and obviously Chris Nolan.<br /><br />A cast including talents like Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Tom Hardy and Cillian
Murphy drag you into a story that could seem convoluted and &#x22;OTT&#x22; but
never really seems to approach either of these as many before them
have. Don&#x27;t go into this movie expecting everything to be laid out in
chapter and verse, this is a movie that keeps you on your toes so to
speak. The details, no matter how small, are very important to the
story and the overall understanding of the viewer.<br /><br />The multi-faceted plot is a work of sheer genius; Christopher Nolan
really does seem to have no limits to his ever growing talents. The
plot in brief follows the &#x22;mission&#x22; of Dominic Cobb (DiCaprio) to plant
a thought into the mind of business heir Robert Fischer (Murphy). The
process of doing so being called Inception, thus giving the film its
title. To do this Cobb must set up his team: Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) is
what they call &#x22;The Point Man&#x22;, his role is to research the target:
Ariadne (Page), a gifted college graduate is drafted in as &#x22;The
Architect&#x22;, this role is vital as she is responsible for constructing
the world of the dream and tasked with making it seem so real that the
dreamer has no idea they are genuinely dreaming: Eames (Hardy), is the
forger, as such he has the ability to forge the identity of anyone
within the dream world: Saito (Watanabe), the man who hires Cobb to
plant the idea and decides that the only way to be sure that Cobb has
succeeded in the mission is to be there and be part of the team, and
finally, Yusuf (Rao). Yusuf is part of the team in as much as he is in
on the task and how things are going to be done but he is tasked with
being the chemist, the one who stays outside the dream world and is
tasked with waking them out of the &#x22;sleep&#x22; when the mission is
complete.<br /><br />The idea or thought that must be planted by Cobb is that wealthy
business heir Robert Fischer must break up the business empire that his
dying father has built. Saito wants this to be done to meet his own
ends; he is a wealthy business owner and rival of Fischer. This is the
main and most important facet of the story.<br /><br />Another being that Cobb&#x27;s wife (Mallorie) played by the fantastic
Marion Cotillard, is appearing in the dream worlds as a projection of
Cobb&#x27;s subconscious and this is a major concern for the team as an
uncontrolled projection can put the mission at risk. There is also a
lot of back story about Mallorie and what happened between her and
Dominic previous to the time in which the film is situated.<br /><br />The final facet of the story is that in return for the completion of
the mission Saito can arrange with customs that Dominic can return to
the family home and to his children who he longs for more than anything
in the world.<br /><br />Everything in this movie is perfect and aimed towards building tension
and excitement in equal measure. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score, similar to that
of The Dark Knight and to some degree Shutter Island, is fantastic.
With its extensive use of Johnny Marr on a 12-string guitar the
tensions rises and the excitement builds and along with the visuals and
special effects of the movie will leave the most emotionless cynic on
the edge of their seat.<br /><br />With fantastic performances from a fantastic cast, stunning special
effects, multi-faceted plot, brilliant score and stunning camera work
and settings, Inception has planted an idea in my head. This is a
classic in the making and one of the few movies of its kind and its
length that held the audience in the palm of its hand for its entirety.
Inception is a complete gem and is a film that all other blockbusters
will have to measure up to. I think Hollywood&#x27;s directors and writers
are going to have many a sleepless night.
