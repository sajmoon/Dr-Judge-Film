All that hype for a movie which took several concepts which were
already turned into movies and combined into a new one with different
actors?!!?! <br /><br />Dark City, Matrix, Time Machine ring any bells? And left some serious
loose ends in the story line. And gave up some of the ending far too
early.<br /><br />Maybe I have seen too many movies. <br /><br />On a bright note tho, the actors fit nicely together and made it
watchable.<br /><br />Even for me. ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
