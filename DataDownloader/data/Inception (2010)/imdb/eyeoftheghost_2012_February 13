I&#x27;m really tired of American movies ripping off foreign films,
specifically animes. The Matrix did it with Ghost in the Shell. Now
Inception does it with Paprika.<br /><br />I went into this having already seen Paprika, which I thought had a
MUCH better story. Because of this I just couldn&#x27;t see how &#x22;complex&#x22;
and &#x22;amazing&#x22; it was. <br /><br />The story is about a thief who can travel through dreams. Inception is
the idea of changing someones decisions based on infiltrating their
dreams and affecting their subconscious. The acting is not bad, a bit
predictable though in the Hollywood sense...<br /><br />Overall, it was a decently executed rip-off, but nothing spectacular.
It&#x27;s a shame that the original Paprika never got even half the
attention of this subpar version.
