In director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception, each of the dream-spelunking
characters carries a totem, a personalised object used to differentiate
reality from the world of dreams. A loaded six-sided die, a custom-made
chess piece. Doesn&#x27;t matter. Just so long as it works. Otherwise, they
could end up stuck in a kind of limbo, forever blurring the razor-thin
line between truth and dream.<br /><br />Audience-goers would be wise to carry similar reminders of the real
world because Inception is a wild, enjoyable ride into surrealism, and
ends up feeling much longer than its hefty 148-minute run-time.<br /><br />The British-American filmmaker has long toyed with issues of
consciousness and memory, and the intense psychological aspects of love
and pain. Inception ties together the various threads of his career, in
what amounts to his most ambitious work yet.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio [ Images ]) is a security agent of the most
unconventional kind -- he guards people&#x27;s subconscious thoughts.
Wealthy clients pay him to ensure their dreams remain uncompromised,
since the dream realm is where we all hide our deepest, most valuable
secrets.<br /><br />Cobb, an expert in dream extraction, also pilfers ideas from his
clients on the side. He hates to live so unscrupulously but he&#x27;s
running from a horrific incident in his past that leaves him unable to
return home to his family and work a normal job.<br /><br />Now, suddenly, a wealthy Japanese client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), is
willing to grant Cobb his ultimate freedom, so that he can be
reconnected with his children. All he must do in return is something
infinitely more difficult than dream extraction: dream inception.
Specifically, he must plant an idea in the head of the heir to the
world&#x27;s largest energy fortune, an idea that will allow Saito&#x27;s own
business empire to thrive. But dream inception requires not just a
dream-state, or a dream-within-a-dream state, but a
dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream state. Not easy.<br /><br />To do this, he recruits a team of veteran dream thieves, along with a
precocious young architect (Ellen Page [ Images ]), and sets about
entering the mind of the heir (Cillian Murphy) during a cross-Atlantic
flight. But just 10 hours, you say? That can&#x27;t be enough time to
implant an idea in someone&#x27;s head? Ahh, but in Nolan&#x27;s dream world, one
hour of real-time is like 10 hours of dream-time. And one hour of
dream-time is like 10 hours of dream-within-a-dream time.<br /><br />From there, things get tricky for our thieves, as layers upon layers of
dreams start piling up, and the integrity of the dream system they&#x27;ve
created becomes increasingly fragile, with potentially devastating
effects.<br /><br />Things get even trickier for Nolan, as he works hard to bring his
five-story fugato to a harmonious close. It&#x27;s glorious and
entertaining, but far too busy, and still ends up slightly incoherent.<br /><br />In interviews, Nolan says he&#x27;s been developing the idea behind
Inception since he was 16 years old. Like a personal dream, he&#x27;s kept
it close to him, where it&#x27;s incubated through all these years of career
success and growth.<br /><br />To be clear, that idea is amazing, the product of a capable, fertile
mind. But like all dreams, the vision seems to have been hard for Nolan
to reproduce and convey while still making sense. That&#x27;s Inception
itself: a breath-taking kaleidoscope of fractured, fragmented emotions,
thoughts and images, but with a few loose ends here and there.<br /><br />Another problem is that, at times, the film feels like it&#x27;s been neatly
cleaved in two -- the story about Cobb and his wife, and the larger
heist story. While the narrative works to bring the two together, they
each could possibly serve as the basis of separate films.<br /><br />Inception should receive best film and best director nominations for
the Academy Awards. Deservedly.<br /><br />As for individual awards, it&#x27;s hard to imagine Leonardo not being
recognised for such a fine performance. While the rest of the cast
performs as expected, it must be said that Ellen Page disappoints as
the architect student. The character&#x27;s just a bit too flippant and
immature.<br /><br />The visuals are first class, and Nolan has convincingly played around
with things as fundamental to our universe as gravity and time, all
without relying too heavily on CGI.<br /><br />Forget the hype machine and the mega-million marketing campaign, and
what you&#x27;re left with is an entertaining, intelligent film. Perhaps in
its execution, Inception doesn&#x27;t truly do justice to the incredible
concept driving it. But it&#x27;s a fantastic effort all the same, and a
sure-fire blockbuster.<br /><br />download movie from http://movieez4u.blogspot.com/
