There are times when you have an experience which leaves you shaken,
confused, inspired, scared yet strong, vulnerable yet impenetrable, and
changes the way you think.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is just such an experience.<br /><br />From start to end, this film keeps you gripped with its unending twists
and mysteries. Chris Nolan&#x27;s patented style of backward storytelling,
and linking the beginning to the end through a web of indecipherable
twists keeps you guessing every minute of the 148 minute adventure.<br /><br />The story is brilliantly written around one of the most common
experiences &#x96; Dreams. It explores the power and possibilities of
dreams. It explores their nature, their composition, their meaning,
their purpose, their potential, and their link to reality. The film
fundamentally challenges the very meaning of reality in a way which is
a sheer joy to watch.<br /><br />The cast is atypical of a Chris Nolan film - utterly exemplary.
Leonardo Di Caprio does a splendid job of the emotionally tormented
Domm, as only he can. Ellen Page contributes in a smart and intelligent
manner as his sidekick who will do anything to keep him from destroying
himself and others around him. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays his role the
way it was supposed to be played &#x96; intensely and strongly. The
supporting cast (especially Ken Watanabe and Marion Cotillard) do a
marvelous job of helping the story unfold and keep the viewer riveted
with top class acting and performances.<br /><br />In summary, it is rare that a film like &#x22;Inception&#x22; comes along. But
when it does (as is the case with almost every Nolan film in the past 8
years), it truly reminds you what makes movies so great.<br /><br />An unforgettable experience.<br /><br />(10/10)
