So is it the most clever movie ever made or is it all just bogus? Don&#x27;t
expect me to answer that. Don&#x27;t expect the movie to be everything. It
can not be. And don&#x27;t assume, just because you liked/hated the movie,
everyone else should feel the same way. Nor just assume that you can
pinpoint every viewer or put everybody in 3 categories. People are far
too complex to analyze and put into one category.<br /><br />What I mean by that, is that you can like this and Transformers. Or
hate both. You can also over-analyze this movie and list it&#x27;s flaws
(yes it has them as every movie has them and depending on your view of
it, you might spot them and care or not), but apart from being visually
stunning, it has a breathtaking story. And an ending that has been
spoofed (at various internet sites), but that works very fine for the
movie. Of course you could also feel that the end is a cheat. But
again, I cannot tell you how to feel about this movie (or any other
movie for that matter), I can only tell you, that it looks amazing and
it made me chuckle for quite a few minutes in a breath-taking sequence.<br /><br />And no I did not get everything when I first watched it. I watched it a
second time and there are still questions unanswered. Does or would
something like that bother you? I didn&#x27;t bother and the movie fully
matched the expectations I had (this was my number 1 expected movie for
2010, the second most expected being &#x22;Wall Street 2&#x22;). To me, Nolan is
more than just a visionary filmmaker. He&#x27;s a great artist.
