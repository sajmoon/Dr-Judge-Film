This film was near perfect in every way. The story line was
interesting, characters were good, acting was great, special effects
were good. However the only problem I had with this film which stopped
me from giving a 10 out of 10 was the fact that they were in dreams but
they didn&#x27;t do anything unusual. At the beginning you see the world
changing but after the first 10- 15 minutes this is over. If i were in
a dream world it would be unusual and I&#x27;d be able to do things I
couldn&#x27;t do in real life but in inception they just seem to be
themselves, walking round with guns. In matrix, there was flying and
fast fight scenes and acrobatics and everything was out of the ordinary
which gave the viewer the idea of how much freedom there is in the
dream world but inception does not present this idea and so keeps to
men just running round being normal human beings. Anyway, other than
that this film was incredible. The story was gripping and had you
wondering what was going to happen next and the idea of dream thieves
is pretty impressive. It&#x27;s been a while since i&#x27;ve seen this film now
because it was a month ago i think but the one thing I can remember is
that it was really really good and kept me watching all the way through
and even better, its an action film that girls like. I watched it with
my girlfriend and she loved it just as much as me and I have heard
other girls saying how good is and so for that reason, it is clearly a
great film.
