This is one pretty awesome movie, excellent cast, well written story,
top notch acting and great effects.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie; however I won&#x27;t say that this is the
greatest movie of all time and that you will die if you don&#x27;t watch it
within the next 5 seconds (although i really do recommend you go watch
it, it&#x27;s good).<br /><br />This is a brilliant movie, but like one of my friends said, it is about
10 years too late to make an impact on movie history. This is a superb
movie that you will really enjoy and love, but you will forget it in
about 2 years, and then in another 2 years, you&#x27;ll find the DVD/blu
ray/direct to brain imaging (if they ever do sth cool like that in 4
years) you&#x27;ll watch it. It&#x27;s no Pulp Fiction, Matrix or sth that will
have ppl discussing years after its release.<br /><br />Having said that, I loved the movie, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
seeing him here and in 500 days of summer was good. He&#x27;s all grown up
after 3rd Rock from the Sun and gave an excellent performance here. As
did Leo Di&#x27;Cap (as is expected of him) and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />They basic story is not entirely original (ask one of your nerdy
friends, they&#x27;ll find some anime or old movie reference) but their
twists and turns were excellent, and visually the movie was a treat (no
not naked ladies type of treat!! the decent kind!) Overall, I really
enjoyed it, watch it for yourself and decide if it really is the
greatest movie of all time and mankind is blessed for having this. 9/10
