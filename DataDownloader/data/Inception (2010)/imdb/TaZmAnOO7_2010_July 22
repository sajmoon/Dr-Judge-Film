Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was
expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating -
couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film
didn&#x27;t work particularly well and it&#x27;s totally over-rated.<br /><br />The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it
pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this
film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only
for people who don&#x27;t have any intelligence and are easily pleased.<br /><br />I like Nolan&#x27;s other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this
movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.<br /><br />I think a lot of people who don&#x27;t even understand this movie, just gave
it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn&#x27;t
that good at all.<br /><br />This movie is certainly &#x27;not&#x27; a masterpiece or anything even close. It
felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this
movie out of the water by a huge margin.<br /><br />As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of
all time?? I&#x27;ve never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the
film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films
- there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was
expecting so much more from this movie. Don&#x27;t bother paying to see it
in the cinema as you will feel let down.
