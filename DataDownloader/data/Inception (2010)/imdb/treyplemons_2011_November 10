The reason I named this review the way I did is because I&#x27;ve fallen
asleep watching this turd of a film so many times that I don&#x27;t dare to
count anymore, my brother unfortunately loves it so I&#x27;m forced to watch
it. They shoulda paid me to come see this crap, because I want my money
back. <br /><br />For starters,......a dream in a dream in a dream?.....you couldn&#x27;t
think of a better way to say that? It makes the complexity of an
already complex movie even more so by adding demensions that I just do
not give a flying crap about. When I go to see a movie, I don&#x27;t like
having to work to understand it. I didn&#x27;t leave WORK early to come
home, get dressed, and take my girl out to WORK, we came to see a
movie. This movie will mind rape you, and in the end, the entire
theater, (myself included) walking out afterwards scratching our heads
and saying, &#x22;what the eff just happened?&#x22; <br /><br />This movie did teach me something though,.....it taught me how to not
get laid. She hated it, I hated it, no poon for me.<br /><br />So do yourselves a favor, don&#x27;t listen to the idiot critics on this
site, bc their too busy shooting up some black tar heroin to know what
they are talking about.....because this movie is absolute trash. 3
stars was being nice
