&#x22;The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise?&#x22;<br /><br />If I had to sum Inception up in only a few words, I&#x27;d say that it was
ambitious, complex, original, the special effects were outstanding, and
you&#x27;re going to have to really focus on it to get the full experience.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is spent explaining the rules of the
process of stealing and planting ideas. This is necessary, but also
entertaining. As you learn the roles of each individuals in the plan,
you&#x27;re slowly being prepared for the second half. And the second half
pays off splendidly. It&#x27;s a cascade of separate characters in different
layers of dreams, each with a different reference of time. It all
sounds complicated (it is, so pay close attention), but it&#x27;s also very
cool the way it all works together.<br /><br />As for the special effects and action scenes, they were some of the
best I&#x27;ve seen. And in a way that didn&#x27;t suggest computer wizardry. My
mind was blown at the sight of an entire city folding back on itself,
and there were several other sequences that were comparable. I can&#x27;t
wait for the DVD to find out how this stuff was done without the
obvious CGI.<br /><br />The cast was as good as you&#x27;d expect, so no worries, there. I&#x27;ll only
go into detail about the three actors I&#x27;m personally most interested
in. I haven&#x27;t been this impressed with Leo DiCaprio since I saw
Revolutionary Road, the guy was a perfect fit for the role. And I love
Ellen Page even more after seeing this. It&#x27;s nice to see her step
outside of Juno, Smart People, and Whip It type roles, and again show
that she has some versatility. As for Marion Cotillard, I&#x27;ll just say
that someone needs to get that chick an action role, because she would
be epic. She holds a gun and wields a knife like she was born with the
things in her hands.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t help but admit that Inception lived up to the considerable
hype. It got better and better as it went along, and most importantly,
all the various threads came together and made sense at the end. I
can&#x27;t understate how important that last part is. It&#x27;s not for everyone
(what movie is?), but this is one of the best movies that I&#x27;ve seen
this year, and definitely the most ambitious.&#xA0;<br /><br />I&#x27;ll even go so far as to say that it&#x27;s behind only The Prestige, among
the movies that Christopher Nolan has directed. If you like that one, I
have a strong feeling that you&#x27;ll like Inception, too.
