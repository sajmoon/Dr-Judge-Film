As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really
looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.<br /><br />You can&#x27;t get much more of a creative license than have dreams and
dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his
salt should be able to really put on something special and I was
expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an
utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to
a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was
simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that
I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be
so gullible.<br /><br />What a missed opportunity.
