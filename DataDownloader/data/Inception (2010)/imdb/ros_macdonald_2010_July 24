When my mom was my age (I&#x27;m fifteen, by the way), her friends were
crazy about Blue Lagoon, and they thought that it was just about the
greatest movie ever made. This made her hate Blue Lagoon with a
passion, not so much because it&#x27;s a terrible movie, but because her
friends were so stupid.<br /><br />Inception is certainly a great deal better than Blue Lagoon, but it
still bothers me that my friends like it so much, and run around saying
that it&#x27;s so deep it makes their little heads hurt. Okay, now I&#x27;m just
being mean.<br /><br />Inception is like a training bra: teens watch it and feel incredibly
mature. It certainly isn&#x27;t my style, but there is room in this world
for silly teen movies, and for that, I appreciate its existence.<br /><br />In case you don&#x27;t already know, Inception is about a talented thief who
steals ideas from sleeping people. However, his job has cost him his
personal life, but he can get it back with one last impossible
assignment: planting an idea in a dreamer&#x27;s head.<br /><br />I&#x27;m going to start with the things that I didn&#x27;t like about Inception,
because that&#x27;s the easiest.<br /><br />The pace is non-stop action, and there are no slow or down moments.
There&#x27;s never any real suspense or fear because the whole movie is&#x85;
action mud. There&#x27;s no silence either; the music is all
chun-chun-chun-chun, but it never stops, so one just gets used to it.
Plus, it jumps between scenes too quickly, making the entire film
completely hectic.<br /><br />Also, there&#x27;s far too much dialogue. A film shouldn&#x27;t have to explain
every single little thing that&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;m not sure if this is
because the audience is dumb, or because the film is too complicated,
but it makes the whole movie feel very unnatural.<br /><br />And likely what bothers me the most would be the one-dimensional
characters. None of them are very interesting, or very complicated. The
only one that has any feelings would be Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character
*forgets his name*, but there&#x27;s not that much to him either.<br /><br />Lastly, I went into the theatre expecting a lot of style, but much of
Inception looks like it had been thought up by a ten year old boy;
especially the scene in the mountains, and the scenes in that gold
oriental room. It also lacks some style in the editing because it&#x27;s
much too consistent.<br /><br />Now that most of my rant is done and over with, here are the bits that
I like about Inception.<br /><br />The plot structure containing about six different realities is pretty
neat, and almost permits so much action. I also like the way that time
has a different scale in each one, slowing down as we get closer to the
real world.<br /><br />Obviously, the special effects are super cool. They&#x27;re nicely done, and
somewhat graceful. They look fairly real too (as real as special
effects can be, of course).<br /><br />Finally, Although I&#x27;m not crazy about the script, the actors are great,
and they act it well.<br /><br />Ahaha okay, that&#x27;s all I can think up for now.<br /><br />Inception isn&#x27;t really for me, but ten to twenty year old kids need
movies too, so I applaud you Inception, for being a movie that makes my
friends feel intelligent.
