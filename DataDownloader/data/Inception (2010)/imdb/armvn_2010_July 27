Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception has been one of the most anticipated
movies of the year and rightly so. Many people like myself have been
waiting patiently since seeing the trailer late last year. After seeing
it on opening weekend, I have to say it is one movie that lives up to
the hype. <br /><br />Inception follows Leonardo Dicaprio as a man named Cobb, a thief who
steals people&#x27;s ideas from their dreams. At the start of the film, we
also meet Saito (Ken Watanabe), a potential client who hires Cobb and
his group of dream thieves to plant a new idea into the mind of a
business rival (Cillian Murphy). This latest assignment is soon to be
his final heist. In the meantime, Cobb takes a college student (Ellen
Page) under the wing. Not to mention, he is still conflicted by his
wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard) who interferes in his plans. The
performances are pretty good, but the technical aspects take this movie
to another level. I have to give credit to Wally Pfister for his
amazing cinematography and the visual effects crew for their work to
make this movie standout. And of course, I can&#x27;t leave out Christopher
Nolan, who is responsible for the creating this world that resulted
into one of my favorite filmgoing experiences ever. <br /><br />It&#x27;s original and mind blowing. Granted, this movie will not appeal to
everyone. Sure, it&#x27;s confusing (a reason for repeat viewing), but it
will give your brain a good workout. The complex storyline requires
your brain to be on the on switch from start to finish. Despite what
people say about Inception, I think we should commend Nolan for writing
and directing a smart, complex, and original big budget action movie
that&#x27;s not for the mainstream audiences looking for just another
standard heist movie. It will leave you thinking long after you leave
the theater. Run, don&#x27;t just dream about seeing one of the best movies
of the year.
