Nolan conceptualized and developed the script for Inception in 2002 and
has since visualized key scenes he would want in his dream project. His
greatest forte as a story-teller remains his ability to draw people
forward into the movie by creating enough complexity for the audience
to expect this - the next scene will explain what just took place. But
that does not happen. Well, then perhaps the next one. And before one
knows, it is past two and a half hours, and one only gets the gist of
it. But that&#x27;s alright! Watch a few more times and one will eventually
figure out those specifics.<br /><br />Now, was it worth the time and money? Perhaps. In this era of clich&#xE9;
movies, Inception is certainly worthwhile. But if one is averse to
thinking through a movie, then this is not the one. Remember the
Matrix? What was that about? Yes, the stunts were mind blowing, the
attitude was cool, the music broke all hell loose, but no matter how
well Morpheus explained the Matrix to Neo, it was never meant to be
understood at the first attempt. The question after coming out of the
movie hall was, &#x22;Dude, so what is the matrix?&#x22; At least back in 1999.
But with Inception, the plot is not outright complex. Even if one does
not understand the specifics, the story-line is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />The theme of Inception is not entirely novel. Dreams and convoluted
dreams have appeared in a few movies. For example, The Cell is the
story of a psychologist who develops a scientific device to enter a
serial killer&#x27;s mind. But Nolan&#x27;s objective was not only to build dream
sequences, but to intensify the visual and mental power around them. He
has always mastered renditions of existing entities by giving it a
mature and refreshing taste. As one of the greatest risk-taking
directors of the century, he builds these interpretations of his own
backed up by some thorough research. We can all expect Inception to
maintain a 9+ on IMDb.<br /><br />So, what exactly was wrong with the movie? If you ask me, this was not
his best. Every time I criticize a movie, people say, &#x22;Come on, it&#x27;s
just a movie. It can have flaws.&#x22; True. But again, someone has to raise
the bar; if not, movies will remain just movies and nothing more. Take
Memento for instance. The plot was simple but the direction changed
everything. Running the movie backwards created an extraordinary thrill
and complexity like never before, literally driving the audience
insane. His movies, Following and Insomnia, did not win much acclaim so
let&#x27;s not talk about them. Then came the Batman sequels. Neither of the
movies stood for super-heroism. His interpretation of Batman went far
deeper than ever. It&#x27;s roots lay in the fundamental understanding of
criminal psychology. It was based on ancient philosophy of good and
evil from both, the hero&#x27;s and the villain&#x27;s perspectives. Both sequels
produced quality dialogs and memorable scenes. The Joker. Heath
Ledger&#x27;s epic performance was not just about him as an actor but the
complete showcasing of a psychopath criminal mind. Every statement and
every move the Joker portrayed a new aspect of criminal mentality and
human psychology. &#x22;This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets
an immovable object,&#x22; &#x22;Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it
takes is a little push!,&#x22; You either die a hero or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.&#x22; Very true and powerful quotes.
Well, for Inception, I can recall only one right now - &#x22;What is the
most resilient parasite? An idea.&#x22; Unfortunately, I found the lack of a
central character in the plot not doing justice to the facet of
dreamscaping. Some may argue that DiCaprio is the central character,
but his role was not anything DiCaprio like. It could have been Matt
Damon, Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Nolan himself. Ken Watanabe&#x27;s role
was not of any significance, whatsoever. His being a Japanese
businessman meant nothing in the movie. The initial scenes shot in
Tokyo might as well have been L.A. or N.Y. Explosions and gunfire
seemed to be used beyond need in many scenes. Chase sequences did not
add much value except time. Michael Caine had nothing to do in the
movie. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music was below par, when compared to Dark Knight
or Gladiator. It did not go in sync with the movie&#x27;s pace. While the
concept of the movie was genius, none of the characters depicted
ingenuity. Not even DiCaprio. Ellen Page seemed promising in the
beginning, but her intellect was mostly overshadowed by DiCaprio&#x27;s
apparent &#x27;experience&#x27; as an &#x27;Inceptor.&#x27; The movie cannot claim to be a
science fiction, mainly because of lack of reference to the very device
that took them into people&#x27;s dreams. In contrast, every detail of
Batman&#x27;s apparel had a sane scientific explanation through Lucius Fox.<br /><br />The best scenes in the movie were all visual. Sheer brilliance. And all
of them, believe me, all of them were shown in the previews and
trailers. In a way, the trailer seemed to have been made much better
than the movie. It created enough anticipation to watch the movie and
enjoy those very scenes on big screen. They were truly breath-taking.
The anti-gravity scenes were surreal. But it almost appeared as if
these were the scenes that had to be there in the movie and the story
was woven around it.<br /><br />Chris Nolan is a genius. And I could not care less whether he wins
awards for the movie or not. His presence remains a shining beacon in
this banality of Hollywood cinema. My criticisms only reflect my rising
expectations from this brilliant writer and director and these would
not have existed if there never was Dark Knight, Batman Begins or
Memento to compare with. I, for one, am obviously going to watch
Inception many more times because I have to decipher the whole script
and ravish the visual feast.
