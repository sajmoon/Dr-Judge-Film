I want my money back. This movie was long, boring, the storyline made
no sense and every time you tried to make sense of it they would throw
in visual effects that were frankly, pathetic. Do not believe the
&#x22;fresh&#x22; reviews. The movie is so overrated and all the characters are
so annoying. The ending was predictable and a disappointing. It&#x27;s not a
good sign when people are shrugging at each other or snoring. What a
waste--those $200 million could have been spent on our economy. Ugh.
Save yourselves! Honestly, the movie is a rip off of a Japanese
animation film called Paprika. It also rips off &#x22;Eternal Sunshine of
the Spotless Mind&#x22; and the &#x22;Matrix.&#x22; You do not relate or even care
about the characters. They did so much explaining (they had to) that it
was like, just give me the script and I&#x27;ll read it at home, already.
There was so much confusion in the the theater and the smart people
left the first 45 mins. I wanted it to get better, for the sake of my
wallet, to no avail. This movie is a &#x22;Product&#x22; that did not deliver, so
I wish I had the balls to demand my money back.
