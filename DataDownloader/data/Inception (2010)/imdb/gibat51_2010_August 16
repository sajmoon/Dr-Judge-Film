Just finished watching Inception and boy was it a painful experience...
Will not even attempt a recap since it is way too convoluted and I lost
interest 30 minutes in. <br /><br />How such a movie van receive so many accolades is beyond my
comprehension, but then again, quite a few recent stinkers have been
praised as masterpieces.<br /><br />What a waste of talent and money! Seems Nolan adopted the J.J.Abrams
jerky camera style, little character development, almost no storyline
and as much special effects as the budget allows. This is a great
recipe for flotsam and Inception fits snugly in that category.
