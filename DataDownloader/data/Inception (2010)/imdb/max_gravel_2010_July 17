The plot is like a Japanese anime named Paprika ??? So what ???<br /><br />I don&#x27;t care. Who watch anime anyway ? <br /><br />What&#x27;s really great about this movie is that ... it&#x27;s mass appealing
... it&#x27;s visually beautiful and it&#x27;s one of only a few blockbusters
(especially sci-fi movies) that will stay into your mind for a while.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a smart movie and the plot is not overcomplicated.<br /><br />The cast did a great acting job. I really love Leo, Michael Caine and
Cilian Murphy&#x27;s performance.<br /><br />My review doesn&#x27;t need to be too long. Just go see it.<br /><br />I think this is going to become an instant classic.<br /><br />Can&#x27;t wait for the next Nolan movie.
