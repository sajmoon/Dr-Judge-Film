The first time I saw a promotional spot for this movie my immediate
reaction was that this had to be the stupidest looking thing I&#x27;d ever
seen. But before the spot had finished I had done a complete 180 and
was convinced that this was going to be a great movie. And sure enough
it is. What was it that instantly changed my mind when seeing that
first commercial? A seven-word phrase popped up on the screen. &#x22;From
the director of The Dark Knight&#x22;. Ah, this is a Christopher Nolan
movie. Well then it&#x27;s going to be great. Because Christopher Nolan
makes great movies. Every single time.<br /><br />As he has shown in the past Nolan likes stories which are, shall we
say, complicated. He seems to revel in making the viewer&#x27;s head spin
round and round. And with Inception he sets your head spinning more
than ever. This plot is the most intricate puzzle Nolan has ever
constructed. And that&#x27;s saying something because this is a man who sure
does like his puzzles. With this film Nolan takes you inside the human
mind. Specifically inside dreams. And then there are dreams within
dreams, levels upon levels. This could get out of hand in a hurry. It&#x27;s
OK to play with your audience but if you leave them utterly confused
and baffled your movie is doomed to fail. With this film Nolan takes
things right up to the edge but manges to hold it all together just
well enough to allow the audience to keep track of what&#x27;s going on. And
for his characters to keep track too. Wait, whose subconscious are we
going through exactly?<br /><br />A story this complex requires a great cast to make sense of it all. And
Inception certainly has a great cast. The key role of dream thief Cobb
is handled expertly by Leonardo DiCaprio. Cobb is really the only
character who gets much in the way of character development. He&#x27;s a bit
of a tortured soul. And DiCaprio captures that wonderfully while also
fulfilling what in this movie is an absolutely critical task,
explaining what the heck is going on. This is a story which has to be
explained to the audience in rather painstaking and exquisite detail in
order for it to work. And that could certainly cause things to drag but
DiCaprio keeps things moving along well enough as he gets through all
the necessary exposition. Surrounding DiCaprio are a team of fine
players. Marion Cotillard is particularly notable as it is her
character who gives the film much of its emotional weight. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy
all turn in excellent work. And Michael Caine pops in too. It&#x27;s a
Christopher Nolan film, you knew Michael Caine would show up.<br /><br />Inception is a movie which asks a lot of its audience. You&#x27;d better be
ready to do some serious thinking when you sit down to watch this one.
If you&#x27;re willing to play along this movie will suck you in like few
others. It&#x27;s such a great story, one that will keep you guessing all
the way to the end. And that story is performed so wonderfully by the
terrific cast. Toss in some beautiful cinematography, amazing visual
effects and a wonderful musical score and you&#x27;ve got quite a package.
That&#x27;s not to say the movie&#x27;s flawless. For as well as Nolan, aided
largely by DiCaprio, works his way through it the movie does require a
lot of effort to set itself up. So that leaves a lull here and there in
the first half of the movie. But it&#x27;s worth it when the movie kicks
into high gear. There are times in the second half of the movie where
the brilliant story is kind of shunted aside and this threatens to
devolve into just another standard action movie. One particular wintry
action sequence clearly goes on longer than it probably should, the
film losing a little momentum just when it should be building to a big
climax. And there are moments where no matter how closely you&#x27;re paying
attention it is a little difficult to keep everything exactly straight
in your mind. But that will just make you want to go back and watch the
film again. And again and again and again. You need to see it more than
once and that&#x27;s OK because you desperately want to see it again just as
soon as you&#x27;ve finished watching it for the first time. For whatever
little quibbles you may have with it the film is that good. Nolan did
it again.
