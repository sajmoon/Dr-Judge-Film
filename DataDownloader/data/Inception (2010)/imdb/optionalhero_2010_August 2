I think we face double dilemma in film industry at the moment. More the
people watch fake copies, less the good movies are produced and as much
overrated they are. Just like last years Avatar this movie is surely
best of the year and it really offers a lot in terms of entertainment.
On the other hand when we are talking about 9&#x27;s and full 10&#x27;s I am
sorry but there should be a social benefit or at least a slight
humanitarian message which this movie does not include. In terms of
cinematography it really satisfies me. The director is a true
inspiration for all who want to involve in film business, always
provocative, revolutionist and surely creative. The casting can be
evaluated as a huge success but I am sure an elderly looked hero such
as Russel Crowe or similar would have fit into Cobb role more ( even
though Di Caprio was outstanding). Visual effects and sound are truly
brilliant ( I expect 2 technical academy awards) , the plot itself has
some ups and downs but it is not fair to discuss every detail in the
scenario rationally. Finally this is a movie with a cause of
entertainment and it fully serves its cause.
