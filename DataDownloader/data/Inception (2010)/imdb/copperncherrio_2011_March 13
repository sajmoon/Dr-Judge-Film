The best movie so far in 2010. Ken Watanabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt
are two of my favorite actors. That aside, the plot was complex and
throughly innovative and entertaining. I had high expectations with
this film, and it was completely filled to the tea.<br /><br />I was very impressed and my hope for great film plots once again. The
movie is well written and smart. You don&#x27;t have much sympathy for the
main character, but his reasoning and logic to see his children again
in the US is a good motivator. In terms of dramatic plot development
this movie is perfection&#x85; for it is entertaining and well as thought
out.<br /><br />The dream worlds are not overdone with the weird (like Mirror Mask),
rather it focuses on dreams that are close to reality that works under
a certain set of rules.<br /><br />However, even with my empathic obsession with this film, it&#x27;s not for
everyone. If you are into SciFy or abstract movie ideas you well adore
this movie, but for some viewers, this might take more work than they
are usually accustomed to&#x85; Mainly, understanding what&#x27;s going on.<br /><br />Either way, this movie is 100% worth watching. It&#x27;s not life changing,
but it&#x27;s one hell of a story.
