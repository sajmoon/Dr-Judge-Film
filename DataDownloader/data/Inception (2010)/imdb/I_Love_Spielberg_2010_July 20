After three fabulous movies, Christopher Nolan follows them with
another winner: &#x22;Inception&#x22;. The idea of a person entering another
person&#x27;s dreams is not a new concept, nor is the concept of dreams
within dreams. People entering another&#x27;s dreams was explored in a film
I have yet to see called &#x22;Dreamscape&#x22;, and dreams within dreams was
also used in Luis Bunuel&#x27;s &#x22;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&#x22; and
John Landis&#x27; &#x22;An American Werewolf in London.&#x22; However, the effective
use of these themes has not made this a clich&#xE9;, so that helps make
&#x22;Inception&#x22; a great film worthy of multiple viewings. &#x22;Inception&#x22; talks
about the idea of entering dreams to see what&#x27;s going on inside of a
person&#x27;s head. From there, you can unlock secrets or implant thoughts
in another&#x27;s head. This is called &#x22;inception.&#x22; Cobb(DiCaprio) is one of
the people who has a job involving inception. But as he enters dreams,
he begins to have visions of a woman(Cotillard) entering his dreams,
causing him some trouble. What had the potential to be a misstep is
actually a masterpiece. Nolan, who also wrote the script, does a very
good job of storytelling, character development, and handling dreams.
Without a great writer, which Nolan is, a movie involving dreams can be
messy when done wrong. Thankfully, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not done wrong at
all. Though there were a few moments where it wasn&#x27;t as gripping, the
movie still pulled me in. And don&#x27;t worry, it all makes sense in the
end. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in another fabulous performance. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt was really good too. He looks a lot like the late Heath
Ledger. It was almost eerie in a way, because Christopher Nolan
obviously has worked with Heath Ledger in the past, and he&#x27;s worked
with a look-alike now. But that&#x27;s not relevant. What is relevant is
Gordon-Levitt was good in the film. In fact, there wasn&#x27;t a bad
performance out of any of the actors. Cotillard, who won an Oscar for
her performance in Olivier Dahan&#x27;s &#x22;La mome&#x22; aka &#x22;La vie en rose&#x22;, was
great, Ellen Page was great, Ken Watanabe was great. Everybody was just
fabulous. This film has moved Christopher Nolan up on my top 20
directors. He&#x27;s still under Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, M. Night
Shyamalan, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino, but that&#x27;s a really
good thing in my opinion. The ending was really sad, and makes you
think. I won&#x27;t give anything away, but trust me, it is mind-boggling. I
can foresee this film getting nominated for Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best
Sound. This is definitely one of the best films I&#x27;ve seen in 2010. It
seems as if Christopher Nolan can do no wrong. He already has five
movies, including this one, on the top 250 movies on IMDb, and he&#x27;s
become critically acclaimed and loved by audiences. I am incredibly
anxious to see what he does with his third &#x22;Batman&#x22; film. If you like
Christopher Nolan, you&#x27;ll like this film. If you like movies that deal
with the subject matter this film deals with, then this is the film for
you. However, if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with a movie like this, then see it
anyway. It is worth the 2 and a half hours of viewing.
