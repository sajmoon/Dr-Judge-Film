Inception is a brilliant movie in so many ways. The director,
Christopher Nolan, did a superb job with the story. The plot starts off
at a fairly quick pace and from there it can be challenging to keep up.
You will have to pay (close) attention to fully ascertain key plot
details, similarly to Memento. The soundtrack seemed very appropriate
and was also impressive. Leo (Cobb) and Cotillard (Mal) both delivered
dramatic, arresting performances. Overall, I thought the entire cast
did a great job, displaying real chemistry. The way Nolan weaves this
intricate plot together with all the action scenes and multiple levels
of dreaming is quite astounding. In the end, I view Inception as an
&#x22;abstract painting.&#x22; You can simply look at it and you&#x27;ll appreciate
its creativity almost immediately. However, the longer you watch it the
more you realize that this is a seriously complex film. In a sense, it
can go almost as deep as you want it to. It is so imaginative at the
end of the film I wondered how exactly I should classify it. The ending
might frustrate you, but it will undoubtedly provoke genuine curiosity
out of the viewer. This is a must-see film, don&#x27;t miss it!
