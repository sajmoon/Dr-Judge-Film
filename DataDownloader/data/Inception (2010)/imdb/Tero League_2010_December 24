Inception was a deception big time. The movie was not emotionally
engage. Not emotion at all. It was like a long trip going at 40 kph all
the way. Over the top VFX and photosonics doing slow-mo like a shampoo
commercial.<br /><br />The concept of having a dream, within a dream within a dream and then
put an idea in somebody&#x27;s head to change the future outcome, didn&#x27;t
excite me at all. Knowing his previous movies, I knew the movie will
start at the end and let&#x27;s go back to dig. Boring.<br /><br />Definitely his best movie to date is FOLLOWING.<br /><br />If you want to understand what it means an emotionally engage movie
where you won&#x27;t know until the end what is happening and without
Hollywood explosions, watch ABRE LOS OJOS by Alejandro Amenabar.<br /><br />Since when a British filmmaker has emotions?
