I know its meant to be about dreams....is that why i found it so hard
to stay awake to watch it? This is a typical American shoot&#x27;em
up/blow&#x27;em up crapola with ugly characters woodenly reading out a
script so bad it&#x27;s embarrassing. Right from the start, an amateurish
gun shot/smash-up everything you can find scene I realised this was
going to be another Hollywood failed attempt at making a thriller. If
only the guy who made the ads for it had also directed the movie,
sighhh Perhaps they hoped to mix Medium with Bourne Identity, but
failed so badly i kept dozing off. Think eyes wide shut, or mothman 2
for dragging script and plot, and imagine the team at sesame street
being tasked to think up Matrixlike effects and you have it, utterly
utterly disappointing.
