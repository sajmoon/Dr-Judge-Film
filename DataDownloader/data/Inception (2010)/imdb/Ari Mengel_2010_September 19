I gave this movie 6 out of 10<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well the movie is very simple.. the story has no solid ground to stand
on.. the way things are happening are just plain stupid.. the whole
inception idea is almost idiotic.. who in hell would believe such crap
if it would happen to them.. <br /><br />Well the Inception didn&#x27;t work on me I guess.. <br /><br />Architechts???? Are you serious???? I bet even a retard sees dreams
that are more vivid and exciting then crap I just saw called Inception<br /><br />I can&#x27;t believe at how low the intellectual component in Hollywood
blockbusters fell..<br /><br />Seriously... watch it one time just to get over your curiosity and
forget about it...<br /><br />I don&#x27;t recommend this movie.. its an intellectual insult.. <br /><br />What a spoof... so much talk.. so much praise.. Nolan is so overrated
so is this movie..<br /><br />PS A totem??? WTF.. is this movie for preschool children?
