People tend to review movies by talking about the movie and what it&#x27;s
about, then give their personal opinion. The problem is it&#x27;s just that,
personal.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s try something a bit different. Having read the forums, there&#x27;s a
lot of &#x22;no this movie&#x27;s a 6/10 and if you disagree your taste in movies
is bad&#x22;. Well, how about we let you chose. I gave it 10/10 and found it
flawless, I couldn&#x27;t think of any scene I didn&#x27;t like.<br /><br />So, what&#x27;s my taste in movies? (generally speaking.) Before this, my
all time favourite movie was The Shawshank Redemption. I enjoy some
summer blockbusters (Ironman 1/2, Spiderman 1/2), not a fan of others
(Transformers 2). I thought Avatar looked brilliant, but plot wise was
rather &#x27;been here before&#x27;.<br /><br />I enjoy a number of &#x27;kung fu&#x27; movies, in particular Once Upon a Time in
China series, Drunken Master. Further some Asian movies in general,
such as A Tale of Two Sisters, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Police
Story etc.<br /><br />I also like a lot of horror, particularly extreme horrors such as
Inside or Matyrs, but also &#x27;classical&#x27; horrors such as The Orphanage.<br /><br />As for comedy my taste can vary a bit, but I can like anything from
American Pie to Blues Brothers to Visitor Q. I&#x27;m a bit of a fan of
Quentin Tarantino, having seen all his movies, read most of the
scripts, and just generally like his work.<br /><br />So there you have it. If your taste in movies is similar to mine, you
may find yourself loving this movie. Alternativly if you started hating
my taste in movies around paragraph 2, can I perhaps suggest &#x22;Get him
to the Greek&#x22;, given that I can&#x27;t stand Russel Brand.
