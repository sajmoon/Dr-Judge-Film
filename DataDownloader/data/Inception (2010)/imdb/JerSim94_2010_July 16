Inception is an amazing movie that must be seen to enjoy the Summer
blockbusters. The fact is that this movie is probably the if not tied
for the best movie that I have ever seen. The movie is amazing and
should be seen regardless of the liking of which forte, for Inception
covers them all and covers them so well that you can&#x27;t help but have
chills from the awesomeness of the movie, even well after the movie was
over. The acting was fantastic (Leo&#x27;s best performance), and the
writing and directing from the master Christopher Nolan was amazing.
Inception is a must see to, and deserves at LEAST 11 Academy Awards
(but, this might be the film that can get to 12 with Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress,
Best Original Screenplay, Best Makeup, Best Visual Effects, Best
Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Editing). My
predictions: Instant Classic, high grossing, and well accepted by every
movie lover in America.
