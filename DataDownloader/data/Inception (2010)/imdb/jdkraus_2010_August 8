2010_August 8 
The trailers that I saw for this movie built it up as another
CGI-invested, sci-fi action flick. I&#x27;ll be honest, I did not know what
to expect when stepping into the movie theater. After a fast two and a
half hours, I could not even begin to think of what to write about. <br /><br />Following two viewings now, all I have to say is that this is one of
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s most brilliant works, probably his second best
behind &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;. Unlike &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; however, &#x22;Inception&#x22;
is not just a pure action flick (there are some great action sequences
by the way)-there is a unique plot that really drives the film. <br /><br />As basic as I can explain, &#x22;Inception&#x22; explores the idea that people
can get into a person&#x27;s mind and steal his most precious ideas. Don
Cobb (Leo Dicaprio) is a master at that, but his new assignment is to
do the near impossible, plant a new idea. Similarly to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;,
Inception&#x27;s story borders on reality and the dream world, but unlike
the Wachowski Brothers feat, this movie disorients both, leaving the
viewer to wonder what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why I had to see
this movie twice. Even after my second viewing, the film leaves the
viewer to interpret it all. <br /><br />In addition to the brilliant storyline, which Nolan spent years putting
together; the movie has a kick ass cast who all deliver as likable
characters, even if they are the thieves. Leo Dicaprio is particular
worth noting. Over the years it seems that he has not only become a
more versatile actor, but he is able to successfully deliver ambivalent
characters that are plagued by a flaw or a sense of guilt from a
haunted past. He probably won&#x27;t receive an Oscar nomination for his
role, but as Don Cobb, it marks as one of his best roles. I also love
the works of Marion Cottilard and Ellen Page, the two women that try to
influence Leo&#x27;s character. Both don&#x27;t exchange many lines with one
another, but their mannerisms toward each other show the tension that
affects the main character deeply. <br /><br />Unfortunately though, Michael Caine does not have a whole lot of screen
time. The five minutes he has though reveals himself as the wise old
man we&#x27;ve seen in Nolan&#x27;s Batman films. Pure magic I say. <br /><br />The technical feats are flawless. CGI is nearly a common thread in
cinema nowadays, but &#x22;Inception&#x22; has more than big explosions. I mean,
a city folds itself over like a sheet of cloth! The cinematography, set
design/art direction, editing, and sound design are all perfect;
especially Hans Zimmer score. Some critics may call it bombastic (it is
quite noticeable) but it adds to the dreamlike and disoriented
atmosphere that makes up the film&#x27;s essence. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll also add that there are a lot of slow-motion techniques, similar
to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;. Unlike &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; though, it is not used to
emphasize kung fu fighting, but to drawl out the effect of time in a
dream state. <br /><br />My final notes, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is an excellent film, and in my book, goes
down as 2010&#x27;s best movie, thus far. It seems that everything
Christopher Nolan touches turns to gold. I just hope that he finally
gets the Oscars he so deserves. If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie yet, get
off your butt and go to the nearest theater. <br /><br />****/****
