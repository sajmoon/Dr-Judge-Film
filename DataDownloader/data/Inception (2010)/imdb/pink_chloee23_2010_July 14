I got the opportunity to see this movie a week in advance :). Let me
just say it is no disappointment in every witch way! As most of
Leonardo&#x27;s movies are good this one is even better! it will blow your
mind, so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leo&#x27;s
work you will still enjoy this movie. Moments in the film keep you at
the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next. I fell in
love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination
that took in to realizing this movie, Christopher Nolan has yet again
made another great movie. All the cast members did an amazing job with
Inception. Thank you for making this movie, I&#x27;m sure i will see it
plenty more times!
