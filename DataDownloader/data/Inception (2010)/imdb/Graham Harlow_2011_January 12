I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating, as I agree with
nearly all ratings I&#x27;ve seen on the site, but I appear to be one of the
minority who think it is overrated. I couldn&#x27;t emotionally engage with
the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the
outcome for them.<br /><br />Whilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy
to understand. I agree with some other comments I&#x27;ve seen that many
characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and
were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real
reason. So some reactions were not what you would expect for the
situation.<br /><br />Having had time to reflect I would watch the film again, but do not
think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a
similar feel but is a much better film.
