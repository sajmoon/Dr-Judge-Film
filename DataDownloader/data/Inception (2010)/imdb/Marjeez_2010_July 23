Inception is a flawed masterpiece. You&#x27;re unsure as to what to expect
going in but you&#x27;re positive Christopher Nolan simply will not let you
down, and boy does he deliver. This film, quiet simply, is brilliant.
Going in, I felt a connection with every character as I have seen most
of these in other films I enjoy. DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of
Summer), Page (Juno), Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days Later) do an outstanding
job while a few others that do a respectable job. Marion Cotillard
(Public Enemies) gives a superb effort and a downright &#x22;Joker&#x22; quality
performance at times. <br /><br />Why do I call it a masterpiece? It is a dream. Take this as a positive
or negative aspect, but you will literally forget what occurred in this
movie a day later similar to a dream. Not all aspects, as few scenes in
the film are unlike anything seen before in all of cinema and are
simply unforgettable, but the main plot of the film will become a blur.
Unlike Memento, where this occurred because of time-line
transportation, this happens in Inception because of the several twists
and turns it makes on the viewer. Several things go through your head
trying to piece together what is happening that at times the movie
watching experience becomes something greater. It is something unreal
and new to the brain, and it is quiet difficult to convince yourself to
believe. It&#x27;s an extraction/inception &#x22;how to&#x22; lesson with outstanding
visuals.<br /><br />The visuals are like 3D done in 2D. It sucks you into the screen and
makes you believe. It takes all our inspiring filmmakers self-esteem to
an all-time low. It is simply unreal. Is it CGI? It looks too real to
disbelieve but too extraordinary to believe.<br /><br />I understood the main plot of Inception that I knew exactly what was
occurring during the film, but there were too many times where little
aspects did not make much sense. Also, Inception takes thirty-forty
minutes to get going. I instantly realized that the action was a major
factor in Inception&#x27;s greatness. Once the first major action scene
started, my eyes quickly widened. The storytelling and the action are
equally important in Inception. <br /><br />The scope of Inception is mind-blowing. It is as epic as the Lord of
the Rings trilogy but is also set in a modern-esquire environment which
is quite an accomplishment. Although it didn&#x27;t transport me to a new
world like a few other modern films with a contemporary setting, like
District 9, it gave me a new thought process on the power of dreams.<br /><br />Inception is a rare case where a film is demanded to be seen more than
once. It is easier to view it knowing what you have seen already and
incorporating it into the storyline from the start. But unfortunately,
unlike other films that offer similar questions (Mulholland Dr), I also
had a &#x22;so what?&#x22; feeling leaving the theater. I did not care enough
about these characters to try to answer the questions Nolan puts forth,
some of them unanswerable. I felt frustrated and confused throughout
most of the film because certain aspects went against what I knew was
going on. I wasn&#x27;t amazed at the story itself but more on the idea of
it, and the shootout sequences felt forced and annoying several times.
But at the end, you question if these are actually flaws, or just
aspects of a realistic dream. Nolan created a flawless film with
possible flaws. I know.<br /><br />While not perfect, the overall package, I believe, will become iconic.
Nolan has crafted something unbelievably imaginative in Inception, one
that will undoubtedly become a global phenomenon in storytelling,
action and debate.
