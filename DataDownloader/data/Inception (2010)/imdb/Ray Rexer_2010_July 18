Nolan has done it again. This is a roller coaster of a movie, but a
roller coaster you last rode possibly when you saw Memento, but this is
a million times more breath taking than that last one. That last one
was for the most part camera works and cinematic deception. This is an
extremely complex maze, that gets built in your mind layer by layer as
you sit through this movie. If you try to understand everything in this
movie while watching it, you are guaranteed to feel tired at the end of
it, spent for the day. Do not treat this is as a date movie, no matter
how big a genius you are. Be warned, for you will not get laid the
night you watch this for the first time. No amount of head work in your
life could have possibly prepared you for this journey. This movie is
awesome to the power of infinity.<br /><br />Everything is awesome, I cannot use any language to explain the
greatness of the director so I will not attempt, but acting, special
effects all that fit with each other like Lego blocks. I believe
Leonardo helps a great deal in Nolan achieving his goals, but every
single actor and their performance is top notch. In an extremely
complex and extra-ordinary setting, Nolan with the help of his pawns
the actors and the special effects, manages to drive a strong plot. It
is too much greatness anyone ever attempted to put in a single movie
and managing to do so successfully is no mean feat. I won&#x27;t wait for
Nolan&#x27;s next movie. I will watch Inception again and again.(I saw the
IMAX version)
