First off, I saw this in IMAX and I think it was worth the price...with
the cinematography and the sets in this movie, seeing everything on a
huge screen is breathtaking.<br /><br />The movie itself, Nolan pulls off again, I wouldn&#x27;t say its better than
the Dark Knight, since they are two completely different movies, but it
is definitely on the same level of good acting, edgy suspenseful story,
and stunning non-CGI overloaded visuals.<br /><br />This movie is pretty complex though, if you don&#x27;t pay attention to
everything you might get confused and lost with the movie and then get
bored by it. I&#x27;ll at admit there were times when I became confused. Yet
in the end, if you were paying enough attention like I was, you won&#x27;t
be totally thrown off..<br /><br />now people having been saying that this movie is like The Matrix and
James Bond combined, which is a fair comparison, but Nolan manages to
add this special touch to it that separates it from your other run of
the mill summer blockbuster films...<br /><br />everything is balanced out nicely, between the frantic action scenes
and the serious talking scenes, and even though there are scenes where
several different scenes are going on at once somehow it works.<br /><br />go out and see it!
