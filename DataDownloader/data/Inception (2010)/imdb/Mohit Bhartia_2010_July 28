After watching The Dark Knight, I asked myself if I would ever see a
better movie in future. But INCEPTION, has surpassed every film I have
seen till date.It deserves the Top Spot on IMDb Top #250 (its currently
at #3). <br /><br />This film is so engrossing that I had to stop chewing my Caramel
popcorn to avoid any disturbance/distraction resulting in me missing a
vital dialogue or still. Never have I come out a movie dumb-struck,
hands numb, all the hair on my body standing and in a state of trance.
If you want to be so absorbed that you don&#x27;t realize what you are
seeing is reality or a dream, go watch Christopher Nolan&#x27;s INCEPTION.<br /><br />Nolan has put himself into the category of the greatest Directors of
all time with this masterpiece. The Dark Knight occupied the Top Spot
on IMDb Top #250, two days after its release, Inception is currently at
#3 with Memento at #29. Isn&#x27;t this reason enough ! He keeps raising the
bar every time he makes a film be it with Memento, Prestige, Batman
Begins,The Dark Knight or INCEPTION. Inception is truly his greatest
masterpiece till date!<br /><br />After watching this mind captivating out of the world film, I don&#x27;t
know what to expect of Batman 3 (sequel to The Dark Knight) coz I am
sure it is gonna be a movie which you cannot dream of.<br /><br />INCEPTION will keep you hooked on to it not only after you leave the
theater but maybe for days or even weeks. You will have to watch it
several times to actually understand it fully.<br /><br />I remember when a journalist said to Rahul Dravid (an Indian Cricketer)
in early 2004 when he was in prolific form. He said, &#x22;You have reached
your peak. Now the only way is down&#x22; to which Dravid replied, &#x22;How do
you know this is the peak. It may be still higher.&#x22;<br /><br />I can&#x27;t help but draw comparison with Nolan and the above sentence. I
believed that Nolan had made the movie of his career and perhaps of
this generation after watching &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; but TDK looks an
ordinary movie in front of INCEPTION.<br /><br />Just go watch it. And please don&#x27;t buy yourself popcorn or coke. The
noise of the crunch will distract you. Keep up with the movie or you
will be lost.<br /><br />Amazing end to the movie and Simply out-of-the-world ! There is no
superlative to describe this movie.<br /><br />10/10.
