Jus now returned from watching INCEPTION in IMAX. First of all I would
like to appreciate the screenplay of the movie which makes you to stick
to your seats for about two and half hours...<br /><br />Being a fan of Christopher Nolan, I was thinking myself that how can a
simple idea can make a man to make miracles.. and he is the man of
amazing creativity..<br /><br />Filled with True suspense and its just like a masterpiece. Chris had
again proved himself by making the audience get indulged into the play
right from first minute of the movie..<br /><br />Coming to the background score, its really awesome.. All credits goes
to Hans Zimmer.. After THE DARK KNIGHT, I&#x27;d fully enjoyed the BGS of
this movie which is entirely filled with suspense.<br /><br />As the movie goes on, you indulge yourself into deeper layer by
layer... Its like not the characters are moving on the screen, it is
like your mind and your thoughts getting deeper.. <br /><br />Perfectly matched crew for a perfect story..<br /><br />On the whole.. its is the best movie of 2010 with having all the
technical and visual values up to the mark..
