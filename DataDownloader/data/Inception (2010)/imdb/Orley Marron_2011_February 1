We watched this movie in our 10th grade class as part of our
&#x22;meta-fictional, self reflective art&#x22; theme. The students were
extremely enthusiastic (several had seen it once before and discovered
many new details in the second viewing), and came up with many
interesting and thought provoking questions. I highly recommend the
film as part of a literature / philosophy curriculum - it provides
marvelous ideas, metaphors for reality and the subconscious. It can be
used along with &#x22;Synecdoche, New York&#x22; and &#x22;State &#x26; Main&#x22; to analyze
the process of art making - specifically film-making - and how creators
and audiences engage in a mutual constructive and destructive
relationship. We also tied it in to Shakespeare&#x27;s use of play - within
- a-play and self reflective commentary in Hamlet and other plays.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is in itself an inception - for self reflection and
philosophy in the classroom.
