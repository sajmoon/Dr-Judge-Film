It&#x27;s not as confusing as they make it out to be. A great balance of
story, drama, and action. The concept of dreams has never been this
detailed. Nolan makes sure he dishes the info before immersing us into
one of his labyrinths.<br /><br />Despite the lack of character development for supporting players in
favor of the main protagonist, they still play important parts and get
the most iconic scenes in the movie. Performances are strong by
DiCaprio and Cotillard. <br /><br />It&#x27;s a mind-bending thriller that should be viewed more than twice.
Fans of Nolan&#x27;s works will enjoy his take on a heist film.<br /><br />Say hello to movie of the year (so far).
