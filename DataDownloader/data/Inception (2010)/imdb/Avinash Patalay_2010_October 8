2010_October 8 
A decade ago first time I watched &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; which can be best
summarised &#x22;mind-bending plot meets mind-numbing experience&#x22;. It took
me a good couple of viewings to get the gist of it and a few more to
get it right. After &#x22;Inception&#x22; I feel the same, its puzzle which would
keep me engaged for sometime to come. No two ways about it, the concept
is clever and complex at the same time. Only a maverick can pull the
spectacular feat of translating on the screen, and Mr. Christopher
Nolan makes use of CGI quite effectively (without being risked as
overdose). <br /><br />Di Caprio was good with his restrained look and demons to battle
within. Michael Caine role could be termed as special appearance. Ken
Wantabe forces over-the-top expressions in the initial reels. Marion
Cotillard character initially gets portrayed with negative shades. <br /><br />The process of extraction could have been a prequel in its own right. I
say this because the explanation of the concept was too quick and it
moved to the &#x22;Inception&#x22; part hastily. <br /><br />So far the conventional plots were wrapped in a single climax.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; has nail-biting &#x22;mother-of-all-climaxes&#x22; - it has three and
failure in a single dream can collapse the entire proceeding like a
pack of cards. <br /><br />I was advised not to even think of using the men&#x27;s room as I would risk
losing the narrative. My advise, don&#x27;t even blink!<br /><br />PS: Forget super-heroes, you should make more of this sorts Chritopher.
