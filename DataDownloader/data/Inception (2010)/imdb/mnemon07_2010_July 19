I had really really high expectations for this movie. Nolan&#x27;s previous
original plot movie &#x22;Memento&#x22; is one of my favorite movies. This movie
is great and entertaining, the special effects are Matrix-worthy and
are visually stunning. The idea of entering dreams and reality is
pretty unique, however, the point of the movie &#x22;reality vs. dreams&#x22;, is
not new by any means. Conceptually, this movie is a mix of
Memento/Matrix/Brasil. As far as DeCaprio&#x27;s performance is concerned, I
find it a bit weird that this is the second movie where he is playing a
&#x22;widower stricken with guilt over his wife&#x27;s death, for which he is
indirectly responsible&#x22;, first movie is Shutter Island. Hopefully, that
doesn&#x27;t mean that he is turning into 1 trick pony. With everything said
above, this movie is worth seeing in the movie theater, you will be
sucked in into the world of dreams and special effects for a little
over 2 hours and will be wildly entertained.
