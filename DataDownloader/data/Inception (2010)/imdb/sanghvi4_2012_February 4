Christopher Nolan has done it again. He has created an amazing movie
that is unique, brilliant, and mind blowing. The concept of the movie
is really interesting and the story does not disappoint. The cast is
outstanding and perfectly casted for their roles. Leo did an amazing
job as the lead character and we really get to know his struggles and
demons as the movie progresses. The special effects are very good too
and don&#x27;t overtake the story or characters. I could understand why
everyone does not agree with the high rating this movie received since
the movie is so original and unique, people might consider it just
stupid. However, those who appreciate great filming will not be
disappointed. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
