To start off with the positive, I feel this film features a good cast
of interesting and likable characters, interesting action and visual
effects, and a story which is compelling and human despite the unusual
setting (much of which takes place in a number of distinct dream
worlds). Indeed, the movie features two central stories with emotional
resonance, one regarding the tortured relationship of the main
character Cobb (DiCaprio) with the memory of his late wife Mal
(Cotillard), and the relationship of the industrial magnate Fischer
(Murphy) with his seemingly distant and recently-deceased father.
Cobb&#x27;s assistant Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) especially shines in wildly
creative scenes inside a dream-world where gravity has been suspended,
and the young architect Ariadne (Page) serves the story well in two
ways, both as an outsider to the world of dream thievery whose training
helps to explain the premise of the movie to the audience, and as a
person curious to get at the root of Cobb&#x27;s relationship with Mal.<br /><br />The title &#x22;Inception&#x22; refers to the idea of implanting a thought in the
dreaming mind of another person, and the central plot concerns a
thought which the industrialist Saito (Watanabe) wants planted in the
mind of Fischer, causing Fischer to break up his father&#x27;s holdings.
Members of Cobb&#x27;s team seem skeptical about the feasibility of planting
such a thought, but Cobb&#x27;s tortured past has shown him that such
inception is indeed possible. Powerfully motivated by the desire to see
his children in America again, but constrained by authorities who
believe he played a role in the death of his wife, Cobb agrees to help
Saito because the latter can pull strings to get Cobb back to his home.
As Ariadne discovers, though, Cobb&#x27;s relationship with Mal ~ which
remains very much alive in Cobb&#x27;s subconscious ~ is a powerful danger
to everyone who joins him in the mission.<br /><br />So the film does deliver on many levels, with good action, good
characters, and a story compelling both intellectually and emotionally.
However, I do feel the movie dragged in spots, ironically because
overdoses of action can slow down a movie rather than help the pace.
Also, despite the fact that the movie is largely about dreams, I felt
that the dreams weren&#x27;t very dreamlike. Part of that can be explained
by Cobb&#x27;s use of the architect Ariadne to construct settings for the
dreams, but real dreams arise from a non-logical place in the brain,
and I think anyone who has kept a dream journal can attest that real
dreams have a surreal quality quite unlike the real world. That isn&#x27;t
to say that the dream worlds of &#x22;Inception&#x22; aren&#x27;t spectacular in their
own way, but I felt the dream worlds of this movie had more in common
with the alternate reality of the Matrix in the &#x22;Matrix&#x22; movies than
any dreams I&#x27;ve ever experienced. As in the Matrix, the Inception
dreams present a world where physical laws can be bent or broken (to
the advantage of skilled and knowledgeable people who are aware of the
true nature of the world), but I suppose I was looking for more crazy,
unexpected, non-logical content in the dreams. Since the movie is
already challenging to follow, such content might make the movie too
inaccessible to most audiences, but I still felt the director could
have done more to cultivate a bizarre and dreamlike atmosphere.<br /><br />Still, all factors considered, I felt this was certainly a good movie
at the very least, and probably worth your time if you&#x27;re thinking
about seeing it.
