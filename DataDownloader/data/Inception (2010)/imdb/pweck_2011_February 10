When I first saw the trailers for Inception, I was very excited about a
movie not based on yet another super hero! The previews had me
impatient to see this new thriller, and when it opened, I was there the
first night.<br /><br />At first, it took a little bit of &#x22;brain-work&#x22; to get it all, but as
the movie progressed, I was more and more in awe of this original and
compelling work. I am always excited to see something that makes me
work at appreciation, if you know what I mean. When you see it, you
need to go in with an open mind.<br /><br />While there were some similarities to the Matrix, it was easy to
dismiss. With all the extraordinary special effects, Inception is
clearly very original in its own right.<br /><br />While I have never been a huge fan on Leonardo, I must say that he did
a great job and had a very supportive cast that kept me entertained 2
hour plus adventure.<br /><br />If you are worried you will not understand it, or get it, and have
heard others mention how lost they were, take it from me - go see it
for yourself or get it on DVD and see one of the most original movies
in recent memory.
