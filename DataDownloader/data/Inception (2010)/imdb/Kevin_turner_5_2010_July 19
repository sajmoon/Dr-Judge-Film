I literally had no idea what this movie was about,I told my GF not to
tell me anything about it and I didn&#x27;t see the trailers. I saw it got a
9.4 with 20k views so I said must be good.<br /><br />The movie was so interesting and I am doing research to see if any of
it is true. The End will stir debate, however I know for a Fact how the
movie really ended or the truth if you will.<br /><br />The answer is this (not a spoiler) It is what it is. That&#x27;s the answer,
of course there&#x27;s dialog that supports that answer about 5-minutes
before the end and another point in the movie which i will not tell.<br /><br />Also if you pay attention to the flow of the movie you can answer the
question you will have at the End as well.<br /><br />I will not say what the movie is about.
