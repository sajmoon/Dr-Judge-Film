Inception is one of those movies that doesn&#x27;t come around often. The
whole movie fits together so well, and does every aspect from good to
amazing. The plot is intricate but not overly complex, the characters
original, the visual effects amazing, etc. the broken down review:<br /><br />- Plot: 10/10. The premise is completely original, the movie has you
hooked for its entire duration. The pacing is excellent, the plot
unfolds and develops beautifully. Nolan has shown he is very good at
non-linear timelines and complex plots, and shows it once again with
Inception.<br /><br />- Characters 9.5/10. the characters are likable, each in their unique
way, and all different from each other. The movie generally avoids the
overused typical types used in some other movies and there is good
character development. Some details are left vague but I think this
adds to the movie&#x27;s plot and feel. - Visual effects and presentation:
10/10. The visual effects are incredibly slick and very well integrated
in the movie,giving Inception a unique feel and scope. The
cinematography is also very well put together, with some truly
excellent scenes in the movie. The sound is also great. - Lasting
appeal: 10/10. I have watched Inception many times and still am not
tired of it. I know I will keep watching it many more times years from
now, and so far every time I&#x27;ve watched it I was just as hooked, just
as into it, and it was just as good.
