From the very starting of Inception one will be engrossed by the sheer
intensity of the film. The beauty lies in the aspect that it deals with
such a common psychological state but still creates an awe. Another
aspect of Inception is that it binds the viewer with the journey.<br /><br />Inception is a movie where we see the magnitude of a director.
Christopher Nolan can handle psychology better than any contemporary
director, but the way he handles the architecture of mind and the
juxtaposition of scenes is somewhat,mind boggling. Leonardo DiCaprio
gives one of his most nuanced performances till date. The rest of the
cast is brilliant. Comic moments created by Tom Hardy is refreshing.<br /><br />Inception is not a movie it is an experience...watch it to just
experience it. After that watch it for a second time to bow to the
genius of Christopher Nolan
