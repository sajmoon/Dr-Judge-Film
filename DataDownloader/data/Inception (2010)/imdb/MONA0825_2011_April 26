Surely IMDb can survive without yet another amateur review for
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. I&#x27;m only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star
rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as
other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to
balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks
fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real
visual delight (the Paris caf&#xE9; scene where Di Caprio&#x27;s character is
explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0
gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that
beyond that you don&#x27;t have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot
line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not
complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and
underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in
this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini&#x27;s movies? Or Tartovsky&#x27;s? or
Cocteau&#x27;s? or Bu&#xF1;uel&#x27;s? Plenty of dream-like images there &#x85; One last
word: it&#x27;s a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr.
Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san
do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can&#x27;t do much
to give some life to his character. An utterly uninvolving movie. I&#x27;ll
stay with Matrix if I want a Hollywood production dealing with a
superficial questioning of our perception of reality and sub
consciousness.
