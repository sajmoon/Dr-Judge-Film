2011_May 5 
This summary will be quite short:<br /><br />Fascinating plot. Really good idea. There were films where minds were
intruded before, but I&#x27;m not sure if there was also a story of stealing
from dreams...<br /><br />Overwhelming pictures. Good characters. Thrilling until the last
second.<br /><br />A love-story (maybe this is necessary in a Hollywood-plot) that is
characterized not so much by romantic attitudes, but a story of
jealousy and betraying.<br /><br />Only contra: a bit overcrowded with main-characters. But: A Leo Di
Caprio in best-form. The same with all the other actors. The chars are
convincing and not overloaded.<br /><br />At any rate a great film, more than worthy to watch, even not in 3D.
