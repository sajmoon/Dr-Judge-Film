Its a shame that this movie is on 13:th place on IMDb:s top 250 list,
seriously guys, its not a classic movie or anything, and in a few years
we all will just say that was junk. Even tough Leonardo DiCaprio is one
of my favorite actors, I still didn&#x27;t think that this is worth a 10/10.
My friends get sometimes angry at me when I say this, but Im just
telling the truth, Inception is overrated as hell.<br /><br />Anyway the movie is about some criminals which uses this &#x22;machine&#x22;
which makes you go into other people dreams and things. Its a very
interesting sci-fi idea and I have absolutely nothing against it.
Christopher Nolan did a great job with directing this and write this.
But the movie is good, but not worth a 10 as I said.<br /><br />Im sorry but is it just me or cant this 20 year old girl Ellen Page
(she looks like she is 12 in this one) handle an action movie at all,
in my opinion no she cant. Some people even says that this is a
complicated idea, no its not. Christopher Nolan makes the people to
think they are stupider then they actually are.<br /><br />But I go to the good parts about this one, it has a good script, some
really nice actors, its entertaining and exciting. And also some bad
parts, Ellen Page, the strange parts in it and that its not a movie
which is so good, Im sorry that i repeat myself twice, but I have too.
And also after the half movie you know whats gonna happen, at least in
my opinion.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is a hell of good actor, but why cant he play a loser
instead? He always gets to play the hero in every movie.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan I am very disappointed, Memento and The Dark Knight
are some of my favorite movies, what the heck is this? I would probably
like it more if it wasn&#x27;t this overrated, come on guys! Someone gotta
agree with me!
