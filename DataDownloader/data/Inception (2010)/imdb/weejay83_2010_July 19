If anyone has not seen this movie, you are missing something. Really!!!
This is one great movie everyone must see. I was awestruck when the
movie ended. <br /><br />It is an example of how great Nolan is. He is taking his direction
several notches further with every film. This film will make every
director feel bad and rethink about the films they make and in the
process improve the overall quality of films made in the future.<br /><br />It is so amazing to see how he has handled a complex script as this one
and presented so that everyone can understand. It shows the brilliant
mind of the director and the clarity in execution<br /><br />Hats off to Nolan. You are truly a master director.
