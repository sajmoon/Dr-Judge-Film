&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a cinematic experience without rival. I have seen it, so
far, 10 times at the cinema and I can&#x27;t wait to go again. What I shall
do when the theatres all stop screening it, I simply don&#x27;t know. It
gets better and better the more times you see it. Part of this is
because it all makes more sense each time it&#x27;s viewed, but mainly it is
because the combination of a lot of individual parts keeps you
enthralled and intrigued from start to finish. The direction, original
script, ensemble cast, and terrific music all add up to cinematic
heaven. I am not even going to begin to mention any of the plot as it
can&#x27;t be appreciated without viewing. The cast are all good. Di Caprio
has never been better, although the highly watchable Ellen Page and the
mesmerising performance of Marion Cotillard really steal the show
between the three of them. Many people I know would probably be put off
by the fact that it is both a &#x27;summer blockbuster&#x27; and a science
fiction film. But it is so very much more than that. I liked the
Director&#x27;s second movie &#x27;Memento&#x27; but this is far beyond expectations.
His own story is scripted magnificently. I truly feel that, in the
current trend of singalong movies such as &#x27;Grease&#x27;, this should become
a candidate for a talkalong, as it is wonderful to talk along to the
script yourself! (Obviously mouthing, not speaking, the words!). I hope
and pray that it becomes the number one movie in the IMDb list.
Currently standing at Number Four, it is definitely worthy of such a
status.
