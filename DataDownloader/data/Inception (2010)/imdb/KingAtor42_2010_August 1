((Warning, Some Strong, Indirect Spoilers)) Here is what I do like
about Inception is that it presented a rather rare and new concept and
presented a rather complex story that keeps the average movie goer
confused to some levels. It also does so with a neat sense of mystery
and thrill that puts the audience on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />The problem is that so much of this is redux! The second I left the
theatre I wish someone had told me I&#x27;d be watching &#x22;Total Recall&#x22;
through the eyes of &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;. Total Recall of course being the
&#x22;inside of as dream...or not?!&#x22; combined with the mystery and love-lost
angst and style of The Prestige as well as Nolan throwing out the now
rehashed, &#x22;last 10 seconds&#x22; to make your really think about it all type
of ending.<br /><br />Outside of some of the complexity, this narrative offers no new
schemes, devices, or twists that are worthy of making it a top 8, 9, or
10 film. In fact, I&#x27;d hand The Prestige an 8 for its innovative story,
camera work and production style, and screen writing. But this film is
in some sense just a redux of that in a more post-modern,
dream-obsessed world.<br /><br />Then there are the film-making flaws I couldn&#x27;t stand. Let&#x27;s first
consider how the films throws you head first into the deep end of the
dream-invasion concept to begin with. In the end, all of the needed
sci-fi devices from &#x22;kicks&#x22; to timing to &#x22;the architect&#x22; and
&#x22;subconscious&#x22; is so rapidly thrown together it confused the crud out
of most fans at first. It&#x27;s a whole new concept with its own lingo and
we&#x27;re barely allowed to figure it out before we&#x27;re thrust into an ocean
of it for the last half of the thrill. Along the way Murphy, Berrenger,
Wattanabe(sp?), Page, and Postlethwaite(sp?) are excellent actors
reduced in their roles or in the case of page, limited to a wooden
delivery. This movie is in and of itself a &#x22;DiCaprio&#x22; picture featuring
Cotillard limited to a sort of &#x22;Pretty looking Freddy Kruger&#x22; kind of
role.<br /><br />Good entertainment, interesting narrative but it is so lacking of
something NEW and ORIGINAL and it limits too many wonderful cast
members that it shows. You can&#x27;t force a weak script to be a great one
by plugging all of its small roles with notable talent to try and make
it shine. This is what producers do when they realize a narrative or
script is crud and try to sell a movie only on a plethora of notable
names.
