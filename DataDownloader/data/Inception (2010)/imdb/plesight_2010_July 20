The Matrix and James Bond? A spoof maybe, but whoever made the
comparison needs to get away for awhile. I loved the old Sean Connery
James Bond and I thought The Matrix was an exciting movie which I
watched several times to re-live the excitement. Generally speaking, I
don&#x27;t go to the movie theater to watch movies. I went to see Inception
because of all the advertising, and this is one of the most
disappointing films I&#x27;ve ever seen! I only stayed until the end because
I kept waiting for something substantial to happen and it never did.
The characters were bland (even Leo) and all that jumping from level to
level was a complete waste of time.
