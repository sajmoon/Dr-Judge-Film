After Darknight, Nolan comes with even bigger and better film which is
sure to blow up your mind. In Memento, he has presented a simply
storyline with a complex screenplay to give audience a new experience.
Where as in Inception, The story is a kind of complex which has been
delivered to audience with a clear screenplay. Go easy, I won&#x27;t give
you a shred of information from the story.<br /><br />From the moment film starts, I was in awe about Nolan how he gets these
ideas and till the end we are all kept intrigued. This movie got a good
boisterous reception when it started and ended with a 3 minute standing
ovation from Chennai audience. The best part was that the movie
screened with subtitle at Satyam,Chennai, which most of us would
welcome for all movies releasing in future.<br /><br />This movie has got a bunch of good performers with Di Caprio at the
helm. Music by Hans Zimmer makes this experience even better.
Photography and CG are perfect. So everything is good about this movie.
You won&#x27;t see any screenplay which explains such complex story in such
a simple way. Go and enjoy Nolan&#x27;s new mind-bending movie, literally.
