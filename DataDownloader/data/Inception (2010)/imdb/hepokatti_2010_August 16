The idea is great but the final output is not.<br /><br />Too much James-Bond-a-like shooting and dummy car chasing scenes that
won&#x27;t do any good for taking the movie forward. You will just wait that
the action(mindless shooting) stops and the movie will continue.<br /><br />Why they are dreaming skyscrapers, guns and soldiers instead of
something more imaginative? The biggest problem is not that the story
has some big holes. The movie is just boring most of the time. I hope
we will not see Inception part II.<br /><br />Leonardo is not good choice for his role. Others do quite well.<br /><br />This movie will not give you any surprises.
