Inception was a movie that i had no interest for when it first hit
theaters. However I decided to see it though. When I came out I loved
it. Chris Nolan really outdid himself when filming this. Inception is
way better than the dark Knight.The actors got really into character
especially Leonardo Dicaprio. The ending was awesome. I just love how
its ambiguous and you need to figure out what happens. I don&#x27;t have a
problem with this movie so if you haven&#x27;t seen it rent because it might
be confusing for some people. Then if you love it, then buy it, but I
am so buying it. Inception is seriously one of my favorite of all time!
Go rent this immediately.
