The critics who say that you have to be dumb to find this movie thought
provoking are ridiculous. I appreciate the main concept that our
actions or ideas come from a place deep inside our subconscious, a
place we know little about, but a place we accept as true, where the
agendas of the world do not interfere... until Inception. Its a great
concept you shouldn&#x27;t knock because you don&#x27;t like the way it was
dressed up. Those watching may think to themselves what would be in
there dream safe. Also what type of real life inception is planted in
our subconscious, and what is the agenda of that inception. Pretty deep
right? Pretty thought provoking right? Exactly. Well I guess that would
make me dumb for so foolishly allowing my imagination to explore the
possibilities of this concept. I would say there was something working
in your subconscious that would make you decide to shred the movie to
bits and call people who enjoyed it stupid. Cool movie I really liked
it nuff said.
