I loved this movie mainly because the story was intelligent,
uncompromising and hit some solid notes. One of the best movie of the
last few years. But it is definitely not the greatest movie of all
time. In five years time it will be remembered as a very good movie.
The Matrix had new dazzling special effects. Memento had a new way of
story telling. This movie has nothing on that level. And there are way
too many logical problems with the movie unlike The Matrix. In the
Matrix everything was logical and air tight. In this movie I can name a
list of things which were not logical. What this movie had going for it
was a story which focused on intelligence rather than cheapness. Like
the whole inception plot was ingenious.
