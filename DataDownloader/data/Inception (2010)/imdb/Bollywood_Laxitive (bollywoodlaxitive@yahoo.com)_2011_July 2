OK there is no point in shouting that Inception is frame-to-frame copy
of &#x22;Paprika&#x22;, the beloved Japanese anime feature, a lot of keyboard
skills have been put to test already.<br /><br />Inception - it is dark and it is gory to its Hollywood best. And its
apparent that Nolans has put in his best efforts. You will cringe when
you look at pillow after watching the movie.<br /><br />Nolans attempted hard but a couple of things did not fall into place.
Only the suave Leonardo DiCaprio could have carried off the role. Ellen
Page was a misfit and so was her unbelievable character. I think she
attempted Hema Malini of Sholay. And I almost forgot about Joseph
Gordon-Levitt. I know that you guys run a mutual admiration society but
is it absolutely necessary to make appearances in all of your buddies
films? Cut it out. And oops I forgot about Ken Watanabe as well &#x96;
apologies.<br /><br />Why the movie is based abroad? It could have been in any part of India
so that the audience can easily relate to. Even the lookout for the
taste of food (some South-East Asian) was hard to relate. It appears
that the brainstorming sessions are a mere farce and are akin to
Dilberts comic strip.<br /><br />Finally, though the movie is dark &#x96; there are a few things which have
been intentionally left out from the original especially when reality
and the dream world are on a collision course after a DC-Mini -- an
experimental device that can record dreams -- is stolen from a
psychiatric research facility.. Possibly because it has never been
attempted on Hollywood yet, US audience is not yet ready, censorship
rules or Nolans&#x27;s public image. Anyways, it wont be long enough.... the
face of Hollywood is rapidly changing.<br /><br />A very different movie catering to only a section of audience.
