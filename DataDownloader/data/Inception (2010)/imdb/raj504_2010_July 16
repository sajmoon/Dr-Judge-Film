I m waiting for this movie like since an year....i finally watched
it.....I always say this thing. Christopher Nolan is a f***ing
genius......nd i m sure gonna keep his portrait in my room....within a
few days......i loved it....this f***in movie is simply f***in
brilliant nd awesome....this is one of the best films i&#x27;ve ever
seen.....this movie is a complete mind game....this movie has a typical
screenplay....if u miss 10 sec....u miss a lot....it was like a
puzzle.....all the time i m watchin this movie...i m completely
immersed into it....i m thinking a lot trying to understand it
perfectly.....this movie gives a lot of work to ur brain.....by the
time the movie finished, every thing look different for some
time......the screenplay is damn great.....and Leonardo DeCaprio did a
gr8 job.....he had his two best movies this year.....&#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;
nd now &#x22;Inception&#x22;......nd he really deserves them.....i loved this
movie.......in fact, i liked this movie more than &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22;.....this movie is a must must watch.
