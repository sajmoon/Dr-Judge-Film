What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected
something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally
unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like &#x27;the Cell&#x27; without the
lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would
drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre. <br /><br />1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I&#x27;ve seen better in
James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be
impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that
there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people
who like to see things go &#x27;bang&#x27; and no doubt play first-person
shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don&#x27;t propel the story forward a
single inch.<br /><br />2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no
spark, no chemistry, thus you can&#x27;t really understand why Leonardo
would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old
flame that he doesn&#x27;t seem to have any affection for when she was
alive.<br /><br />3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one
would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream
landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart
the success of a mission, why don&#x27;t we get any insight of how this
whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so
indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there
apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.<br /><br />4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here,
just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the
first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no
logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically
he doesn&#x27;t sit in the van and mentally he doesn&#x27;t know about the
moments without gravity. Dreams just don&#x27;t work like that and it is an
insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.<br /><br />But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency
here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up
entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in
America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks
being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? <br /><br />I think &#x27;good clean fun-loving popcorn movie&#x27; is just an euphemism for
brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is
brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film
certainly is not.
