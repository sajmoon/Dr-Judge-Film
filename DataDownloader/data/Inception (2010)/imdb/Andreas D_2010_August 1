2010_August 1 
After many great work by Nolan I expected Inception . After watching
trailer I have never thought that so strange movie can make so big
achievement . In this century there are many movies which were good but
I think there is no stranger and better movie all until this . I think
that this year is great and full of quality movies and two of them
broke into Top 10 of all time(Inception and Toy Story 3). This movie is
so specific . It is placed after Godfather which made new kind of
directing and this is also great . This is modern movie and made so
great that after few year people will talk about it . Nolan made the
future and I think that many great directors can hide behind him .
After great Avatar I think that it defeated many great century movies .<br /><br />Nolan as director after great achievement with Dark Knight showed his
best . Direction was really great and he took care for every detail and
made 140 minutes of great job for your mind . It was his home-run and
he defeated every his hater . Script,direction,scenes and effects .
Everything was so great . Many people hate him because he is upcoming
director and most of his movies have enormous budgets but it isn&#x27;t so
important . This summer Nolan will pull everyone in cinema .<br /><br />Cast was great and Leo DiCaprio really had another Oscar worthy acting
. With emotive parts and really big efforts he showed that he isn&#x27;t so
little kid from Titanic . 2010 is his year because after great Shutter
Island we got sci-fi movie for decades . Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom
Hardy were great and they made completely great rest of cast with their
mature performances . And for completely great cast female part did
their job on great way . Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard were very good
in their roles .<br /><br />So this summer there is no better thing then watch this movie . It
conquered year and decade . In 2100 we will see,maybe century .
