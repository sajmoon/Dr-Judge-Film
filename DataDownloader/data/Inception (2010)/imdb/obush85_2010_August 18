I was OK, but I won&#x27;t bother to see it again.<br /><br />You can guess the ending within the first 20 minutes, predictable
script in my eyes, not everybody&#x27;s.<br /><br />Went to watch it with 5 other people who all loved it, but I was bored
for the most part of it, starts slowly and takes over an hour to get
into it.<br /><br />Even with this fictional film, I personally think that explanations of
how things work are descriptions on what is being done still needs to
be in there, but the joined &#x27;dreaming&#x27; wasn&#x27;t looked at and I thought
that I was a bit daft. Even the Matrix tried to explain itself!<br /><br />The acting was good but I just thought the whole story line and plot
was weak and completely uninteresting and lacking originality.<br /><br />All in all, the acting and special effects where good but within a poor
script it won&#x27;t work for me. Too predictable.
