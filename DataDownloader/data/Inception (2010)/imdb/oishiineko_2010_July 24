Christopher Nolan, a director of Memento (200), The Prestige (2006) and
The Dark Knight (2008), keeps surely improving. With hijacking of the
135 street TVs, monitors in electronic retail stores and transportation
facilities in 35 prefectural and city governments of Japan, and the
collaboration with high-rated hacker drama &#x22;Bloody Monday&#x22;, Inception
is never ran out of the topic before/after the release. This gives us
greater-than-expected &#x22;good&#x22; confusion in the best way without wilting
buzz. It gains unspeakable 9.3 out of 10 rating in IMDb. I wonder with
advanced technology and 3D prevalence on the film industry, connoisseur
customer is expecting a perfection on every aspect of vision,
screenplay, and acting. This film is a great one pursuing &#x22;perfection&#x22;
in this sense. <br /><br />As for the story, I wouldn&#x27;t describe more than you know in the preview
and the outline that movie sites introduce, &#x22;the most defenseless state
- tapping into someone&#x27;s subconscious and stealing an idea in there -
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a team of sleep expert, steps into
the most difficult mission which gets a person into a tricky dream and
implant an idea to the person based on Sato&#x27;s (Ken Watanabe) request.&#x22;
This is an important outline in helping the story understand. With
given this only few information about the story, this could be a great
success in a sense that it gives potential audience&#x27;s expectation to a
certain level and still gives them space to chew the story after they
watch the film. <br /><br />If you ask me what types of person should watch this film, I would say
as well as person who like Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film such as Memento
(2000) and Dark Knight (2008), someone who like a film which describes
a spiritual world complexly and realistically such as Matrix (1999),
Vanilla Sky (2001), Waking Life (2001), 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Cell
(2000). Even though the story depicts a realistic interpretation of the
world with seriousness, it is cynical that you would somehow laugh at
something in a middle of the story.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is one of the most attracted directors. Despite the
blockbuster and watched film of the &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22;, he brought us even
more amazing work. I expect his future success.
