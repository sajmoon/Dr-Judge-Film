Where to begin? Well,the soundtrack is unnecessarily loud, noisy and
repetitious and consequently extremely irritating!!!!!!!!! How many
times can you crank the big violin sound up? hOW MANY EXCLAMATION
POINTS DO YOU NEED? hIT ME OVER THE HEAD SOME MORE!!! pLEASE!!!! I felt
it didn&#x27;t sync with the film at all. God help those folks whose
neighbors have surround sound and play this at even normal volume.
After 30 minutes of this I&#x27;m ready to #*&#x26;%#$%%.<br /><br />With regard to the film itself, it&#x27;s the same 15 minutes of plot over
and over and over until you want to throw up! I &#x22;got it&#x22; after the
first 30 minutes but apparently this director believes his audience is
comprised of morons who enjoy spending 2 1/2 hours watching pointless
gun battles and cars crashing. And it appears that his conclusion may
be true based on the gushing praise for this over-hyped grade &#x22;C&#x22;
movie. Little of this &#x22;special effects&#x22; activity advances the film in a
significant way. How boorish! By far one of the worst acclaimed films
I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;d rather go to the dentist than sit through this. My
biggest regret is I can never regain the time I spent on this utterly
silly piece of #$@&#x26;*^%*.
