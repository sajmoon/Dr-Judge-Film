I got to watch this a few days earlier than the actual premier here in
Sweden. By that time, I had already read a lot about the movie on here
and other websites. This has also been a very very anticipated movie
for me.<br /><br />Reading all the reviews about how brilliant this movie is, and knowing
Nolan&#x27;s previous works, I had very high expectations going into the
theaters to see Inception. It did not disappoint. Oh no...<br /><br />Let me just tell you about my own reaction as the ending credits rolled
on the screen. I was just sitting there with my pop corn bag still
full, still eyes and open mouth and thinking &#x22;what the hell did I just
watch!&#x22;. This movie is not digested for you, you have to think about it
afterwards, which is also a sign of a good movie.<br /><br />During the movie, you enjoy the amazing effects, the fast pace action
scenes, great daloge with a dash of humor at parts, and the brilliant
sound track created by Hans Zimmer. It&#x27;s after seeing the movie that
you start thinking and taking it all in. Then you realize what a great,
original and truly amazing movie this is.<br /><br />Actors all do their share with great effort and good chemistry between
them. I didn&#x27;t get tired of any of the characters as they all share the
screen time among them very well.<br /><br />Ah, I thought I would come on here and write a review about what I
think about Inception, but i just can&#x27;t do it. I need more time, more
words and more space. What I can tell you however, is that the movie is
a bit difficult to understand at first, but sit through it as it clears
up later. It is definitely the best movie this summer, and 2010.<br /><br />Thank you Christopher Nolan and the whole crew for creating this
masterpiece! Cheers
