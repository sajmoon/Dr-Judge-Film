I found Inception to be quite the intelligent execution of script and
storyline. Nolan executed it quite well and has a knack for being one
of the few directors who is able to direct commercial fare with notable
actors. He changed the face of comic book films with his take on The
Dark Knight and has solidified his presence with Inception. I say this
from a point of view noting that most studio films lack any quality. So
Inception is a great movie, but mostly just by comparison to the
lackluster quality of pics being made these days.<br /><br />The acting was not exceptional. I felt that DiCaprio basically walked
through his performance. He has enough credibility to fall back on. The
strongest performance I felt was given by Tom Hardy. I thought he stole
every scene that he was in and always was left wanting to see more of
him in the film. <br /><br />Overall, it was a great film. It was like Memento with 25 times the
budget.
