2010_July 21 
Set for a November 2010 release, Terrence Malick&#x27;s long gestating The
Tree of Life is my pick for the year&#x27;s big Oscar film. The details of
the production have been kept as secret as any major production ever,
word slipping here and there that the film is the product of nearly
three decades of writing by Malick. The production is said to be huge
and the post-production as labored-over as any. All that said, I refuse
to believe that Tree&#x27;s production will match that of the just released
new Christopher Nolan film, Inception, surely another big Oscar film.<br /><br />Where to begin? Inception, Nolan&#x27;s seventh proper feature, is the
British-American auteur&#x27;s biggest, strangest, most promoted, most
anticipated and most memorable work yet. Opening this past weekend at
No. 1 with over $60 million in US sales, I left the theater wondering
three things about the dreamy heist flick: 1) how many people in the
theater with me were able to follow not just the bombastic action, but
the delicate storyline? And what did they think that final shot meant?;
2) How the f%#@ do you write something like that?; and 3) which of
Screen time&#x27;s favorite directors saw this film? Malick? Tarantino?
Scorcese? Spielberg?! What did they think of it? This, I&#x27;d love to
know.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t alive when Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 sci-fi epic 2001: A Space
Odyssey was released, but I can still watch it today and feel its power
and originality, every time wondering how it made Kubrick&#x27;s
contemporaries feel. My guess is that it made them all realize that
they needed to think harder and work harder. Even if your name is
Spielberg and you made an epic production called Saving Private Ryan,
Inception likely has a similar 2001 effect on you. More than Star Wars
in 1977 or Avatar just last year, Inception just feels bigger, grander,
more labored over and &#x22;next level&#x22; than anything of recent memory.
Films likes Ridley Scott&#x27;s Blade Runner, Tarantino&#x27;s original Kill Bill
cut, Nolan&#x27;s own The Dark Knight are humbled by the mastery and
creativity of Inception.<br /><br />That said, Inceptions is not the best film to see a US release in 2010.
Not in our book. It may be the best made film of 2010, but a better
film, Jacques Audiard&#x27;s Un Prophete, has already been released and
there are a couple coming yet (The Tree of Life, mostly), that stand to
be better. After such a rant about the brilliance of Inception, how can
I already say such a thing? Well, many reasons. For starters, Inception
is an often tedious film. Using a chopped-up non-linear storytelling
device, Nolan has made an extraordinarily cerebral caper film that&#x27;s
dressed up as a big summer blockbuster. There&#x27;s enough action to make
Sly Stallone blush, which is cool, but there&#x27;s also an awful lot of
important dialogue. You have to hear every word in the film so much so
that, in fact, if you simply sneeze at the wrong parts of the film,
you&#x27;ll miss something that could maybe spoil your complete
understanding of what&#x27;s going on. (Tedious is the word I keep coming
back to, even if I&#x27;m uncomfortable using such a negative word to
describe such a masterful work.) If you&#x27;ve not yet seen the movie,
imagine sitting in a theater for 150 minutes, paying close attention to
every word and movement, never more than a 10 second break for a joke
or two. Plan to walk out of the theater with a fried brain, dropped jaw
and crossed eyes.<br /><br />But hey, let&#x27;s not knock an artist for being wildly ambitious. I&#x27;m cool
with Inception frying our brain. And, aside from that, I have very few
issues with the movie. Sure, the setup (basically, these dudes gotta
crack into this younger dude&#x27;s dreams and plant an idea in this his
mind before he turns his dad&#x27;s company into a Wal-Mart-like monster) is
incredibly underbaked compared to what follows, but that&#x27;s no big deal.
And the casting, aside from Marion Cotillard (who is perfect), seems a
bit off, DiCaprio&#x27;s Dom Cobb seeming a bit too similarly played to his
recent Shutter Island performance. The still-very-young-feeling Joseph
Gordon-Levitt as the mature daddy of the operation? Ellen Page as the
big brain? Ummm.<br /><br />Now let&#x27;s focus on the good things. The writing, which is brilliant.
People who write as well as Nolan usually write long, details novels.
But Nolan thinks equally in movement and vision, and we&#x27;re the luckier
for it. His writing, especially in Memento and The Prestige, has always
been impressive, but here he makes his mark. The amount of detail and
thought put into this puzzle is mind-blowing. Look for Nolan to grab an
Oscar nomination for his original screenplay. No. 2 on the list of
things Inception does impossibly well is editing. You have to see it
twice to believe it. Telling a story like this on paper is hard enough,
but taking moving pictures of it, adding sound, music and CGI, then
cutting it all up non-linear-style and making sense of it is the
hardest part of the process. Editor Lee Smith, known mostly for his
work with Peter Weir, will win 2010&#x27;s Oscar for Best Editing. He
should&#x27;ve won it in 2008 for The Dark Knight and in 2006 for The
Prestige, but he will win it in 2010. His time has come, and Inception
is the film Smith will be remembered for.<br /><br />There&#x27;s much more to say about the tedious but brilliant, visually
inventive yet action-packed new Christopher Nolan movie, but let&#x27;s not
get carried away. It&#x27;s just a movie. It&#x27;s just the movie that deserves
all of the attention Avatar received last year but won&#x27;t (this because
it makes you think too hard). It&#x27;s just the movie that (fingers
crossed) might change the way Hollywood studios treat big brain artists
with big ideas. For a while, anyhow. And we have Christopher Nolan and
his brilliant new sci-fi mindbender to thank.
