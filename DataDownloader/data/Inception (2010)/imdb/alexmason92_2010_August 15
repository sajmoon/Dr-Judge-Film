The main plot in Inception is that Cobb played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is
a futuristic thief who can intercept people&#x27;s dreams. He is hired by a
businessman to plant an idea into the mind of a corporate kingpin.
Inception is by far very complicated and it&#x27;s up to you the viewer to
interpret it in your own way. This is why the Inception is so effective
as it really allows us to get involved in the film. Inception is in my
mind, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s master piece as it keeps you hooked from
start to end even though it does start to die down a little in the
final third of the film. Inception is a film you will need to see
several times to really make your own mind up on the whole idea of the
film. I would compare it more towards The Matrix with a hint of the
James Bond action sequences. Inception is really effective in
connecting with the audience and leaves us with questions well after
the film has finished, making it a real competitor for an Academy
award. Overall, Inception is a true masterpiece and deserves all the
credit it&#x27;s receiving as it will leave you pining for more.
