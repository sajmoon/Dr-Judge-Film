I got to say that this is hands down THE best film of the year. Not
since the days of Kubrick and Hitchcock has a thriller been this
dazzling, perplexing, emotional, and ultimately satisfying. I&#x27;ve since
longed for a highly intelligent film of both filmmaker&#x27;s caliber and
having been anxious in anticipation, I&#x27;ve finally gotten it in the form
of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22;. I am so very
pleased.<br /><br />I have to admit it was very confusing at first but as it went along, I
got more and more involved and understood what was happening. The first
hour sets up the premise superbly without resorting to cheap, clich&#xE9;&#x27;
gimmicks like most Hollywood blockbusters and that&#x27;s a plus;
considering this film is from a talented group of craftsman who truly
put a lot of thought and conviction into this film. What a
screenplay!!! Truly inventive. I&#x27;ve never been this intrigued since the
first time I saw &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22;. Along with the talented performances
of Leo Dicaprio, Ellen Page, and of course, Marion Cotillard, unique
premise, tightly written and intelligently thought-out script, and the
brilliant action and special effects, is the core essence of the human
mind. This film is cerebral to the core as it explores our inner
thoughts in ways that have never before been seen in any film. What
dreams are and how they define us is one of the many themes that are
covered in &#x22;Inception&#x22;. What drives our virtues, our feelings, our
perception of the world around us? Are we truly who we think we are, or
are we mere shadows of what we are. Those are the many questions that
are prevalent in &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />As good as the Matrix was, I enjoyed it for it&#x27;s take on our
perceptions of reality but it pales in comparison to the brilliance of
Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece because it goes places a lot deeper than that film
put together. The Matrix films barely scratched the surface of what is
the difference between the real world and the world of dreams. In the
case of &#x22;Inception&#x22; Nolan&#x27;s vision has taken us to a world that not
only is fantastic but almost entirely plausible. And that&#x27;s a feat that
even The Matrix couldn&#x27;t accomplish. The very ideas that abound in
Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece are taken in so many exciting yet treacherous
directions and that&#x27;s why I wholeheartedly recommend you see this film.
Ambitious and oozing with style, &#x22;Inception&#x22; has earned it&#x27;s place as
one of the top sci-fi thrillers in the history of cinema.
