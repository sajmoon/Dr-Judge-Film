&#x22;Dreams feel real while we&#x27;re in them, it&#x27;s only when we wake up that
we realize something was actually strange.&#x22; One of the bitter themes of
the movie that hangs on to this genre bending sci-fi action epic is
quoted by the character played by Leonardo DiCaprio. And so starts off
the movie that&#x27;s just as ingenious and complex from the man who made
Memento.<br /><br />The movie is a corporate espionage thriller that works within the
levels of the human mind and dreams. It follows Dom Cobb played by
Leonardo DiCaprio as he tries to make his way back home to America by
taking one last job that will give him that freedom. Accompanied by his
team, a new recruit and his employer, Dom is forced to make choices
that could either put him at risk in losing his mind or achieving his
last request.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio heads the
ensemble and the crux of the story with true potential and charm. His
act is the center with each new turn. A role that is so wonderfully
written, it matches the nature he has to go through. Also in the cast
is Ellen Page, his new sidekick who helps Dom get past his nightmares.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the accomplice who has been working with Dom for
so many years that he knows his methods inside out. Tom Hardy, playing
Eames the no-nonsense easy-going right hand man. Ken Watanabe, the man
who may or may not help Cobb. Cillian Murphy who plays the target they
are going after. Marion Cotillard, Dom&#x27;s wife who may threaten his
entire mission because of his emotional attachment to her. And also
finally Tom Berenger in a great supporting role along with Michael
Caine to fill in the rest of the back story. All in all it&#x27;s one
perfect ensemble who make the complete story.<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing by Wally Pfister yet again. His
realistically lit shots mixed with noir lighting is a trademark on it&#x27;s
own just like The Dark Knight. And this time bringing in high-speed
photography in the mix adds a whole new level to the story. The editing
is sharp, never giving away too much of the dream yet making you feel
it is that real. The art direction is also key, all from the huge
revolving sets to the very narrow corridors that converge is almost
Kubrickan like. The visual effects also don&#x27;t seem to be just placed
there, they are put down for a reason, to fill the gaps. The music is
great, right from the thumping beats to the James Bond homage, it&#x27;s a
definitive electronic track.<br /><br />After coming out of this, it felt like this movie operated on a level
The Matrix did not go to, it offered just so much more that it&#x27;s
emotional center was going with it, filling every reason why it was
there.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is one of the bravest, visionary and original
performers still out there doing what he does best. Even by making a
small idea into an epic, is the reason why he is there with the best.<br /><br />My vote is 10 out of 10. You must see this movie even if you don&#x27;t want
to.
