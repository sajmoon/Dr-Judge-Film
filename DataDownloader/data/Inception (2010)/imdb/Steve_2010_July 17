2010_July 17 
I went to see this film on first night of general release in the UK and
I can&#x27;t remember a time when I walked out of a cinema at the end of a
movie and there was such a palpable thrum of excitement.<br /><br />Judging by this film&#x27;s current score on IMDb, it&#x27;s going to be a
landslide of a success and deservedly so. Here&#x27;s why: <br /><br />1. The special effects are quite simply beautiful - the perfect mix of
elegance and awe.<br /><br />2. It&#x27;s pretty much perfectly cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is the draw to
get you through the door, and while he&#x27;s never been the greatest actor
(I always think he&#x27;s two heart beats away from a full blown Jack
Nicholson impersonation), his screen presence certainly holds your
attention, and keeps you grounded. He&#x27;s just getting better with age.
Playing around DiCaprio is probably the dictionary definition of an
ensemble cast. A host of familiar faces flesh out the story, some more
famous than others, and with the exceptions of Michael Caine and Pete
Postlethwaite (who both incidentally execute their brief roles with
perfect competence), they share a common thread in that their stars all
seem to be in the ascendant (and starring in this film will certainly
helped their causes). It reminded me of the &#x22;Beat Brynner&#x22; mindset of
the other six in The Magnificent Seven. Tom Hardy comes off very well,
and nice to see Drag Me To Hell&#x27;s Dileep Rao getting more roles - He&#x27;s
a class act.<br /><br />3. The plot (and I hope this isn&#x27;t a spoiler) is absolutely bonkers,
but brilliantly paced and conveyed to the audience. The film contains
some pretty lofty conceptual abstractions, but Christopher Nolan seems
to have the perfect touch for keeping an audience up to speed, and
firmly grounded in the story. Both of the new Batman reboots have been
quite complicated and are certainly more cerebral than your average
super hero flick - but Inception is on a whole different level. Nolan
bravely trusts in the intelligence of his audience and resists the
temptation to dumb it down avoiding so many of the familiar clich&#xE9;s
that would simplify what is such a fiendishly complicated, but
infinitely rewarding story. <br /><br />4. You&#x27;ve seen this type of film attempted so many times before (What
Dreams May Come, Matrix etc), you sort of go in prepared for the fact
that there&#x27;ll be a trade off, that the realisation of the story will be
compromised - either plausibility will go out of the window, sacrificed
to maintain the plot&#x27;s integrity, thinly held together by sexy action
scenes or the concepts will be so incompletely expressed, that as your
understanding and interest wanes, you get dragged down into the mire
and you probably fall asleep well before the credits roll - NOT so with
Inception - It is a white knuckle ride of a story, pretty challenging -
but do not be put off by what people say - Think of it as a fairly
difficult lesson but taught by a supremely talented tutor.<br /><br />5. The action scenes are well paced with real urgency, and are as
satisfying as watching Indiana Jones breaking a Nazi&#x27;s jaw. Unusually,
for a film of it&#x27;s kind. I always felt that The Matrix suffered from
too much slo-mo but Inception keeps that to a tolerable minimum (and
when it does to it&#x27;s relevant to the plot) <br /><br />In short, I agree that this film does live up to the hype and then
some. But I have to confess, that I&#x27;m a little taken aback by some of
the fervour for this movie - it&#x27;s a brilliant film for sure, but are we
really so used to being disappointed by the blockbusters that when a
great one comes along, it&#x27;s greeted with messianic rapture? This film
might be regarded as a religion in ten years time, but only by the same
sort of dreadful boring imbeciles who are campaigning to have &#x22;Jedi&#x22;
instituted as a recognised faith, or who think the Matrix &#x22;might
actually be happening now - ooooooooooh&#x22; <br /><br />Great film - go see it!
