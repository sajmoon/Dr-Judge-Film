No really, it would be far better. Anyone who saw Shutter Island know
that.<br /><br />Instead we got mix of Matrix and attempt to bring elaborate drama to
story. Nolan does tries but not his best, he did not kick it here good
enough. And we now he can, there are other examples of that (Prestige,
Dark Knight). Thing here it seems he could not decide to pursue drama
that is private to De Caprio or to pursue more intensely action and
dream sequences making it more of an action flick.<br /><br />Concept, although interesting, was sluggish in execution. More than few
times movie feels lost, and that is something you should avoid in
movies of this genre (psycho thriller).It is like Nolan did not know
how to wrap it all up. He did at the end but not in very interesting
way.<br /><br />I would gave this movie 5 star but Leonardo performance is exceptional
so there goes one extra star.
