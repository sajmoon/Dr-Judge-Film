To begin, I have been waiting for this film since Christopher Nolan
announced it. All films I have seen from him are amazing and I usually
have high expectations for him. After The Dark Knight, I expected a
great deal from this film. The previews only helped to flame the fire.
It is also a common thing for me that when people talk about how
wonderful a film is, I walk into the theaters overly-hyped and usually
walk out disappointed. Case-in-point: Avatar. I was beginning to get
over-hyped with this film since people couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it
and everyone loved it.<br /><br />Now, isn&#x27;t it wonderful when you can get over-hyped and walk into a
movie with sky- rocketing expectations and still come out completely
satisfied? Yes, it&#x27;s wonderful! And yes, that happened with this movie!
The movie follows a team of mind-navigators that specialize in stealing
secrets. They find that they may be well in over their heads when they
accept the job of performing an inception, a task where they must plant
an idea so deep in someone&#x27;s mind that the person must believe that it
is their own idea. This movie was amazing! The story was original and
thought-provoking, the graphics were incredible, the acting was very
good, the music was awesome, and the ending was perfect! I know a lot
of people were upset with the ending, but I loved it! The end! This
movie was awesome! My favorite movie of all time, and that is a hard
bar to reach! Thank the heavens we have Christopher Nolan around to
create astounding movies and never leave us disappointed! And just a
hint for Hollywood, he didn&#x27;t have to do it with all the sex and the
cussing and the gore that you think is oh-so-necessary!<br /><br />Okay, this is the end for reals.<br /><br />But the movie was awesome. <br /><br />Okay I&#x27;m done.<br /><br />It rocks. Last thing I&#x27;m gonna say.<br /><br />Awesome.
