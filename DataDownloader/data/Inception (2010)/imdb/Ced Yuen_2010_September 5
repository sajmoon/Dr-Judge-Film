The annual batch of blockbusters is upon us. What do we have this year?
&#x27;Iron Man 2&#x27;, &#x27;Toy Story 3&#x27;, &#x27;Shrek 4&#x27;, &#x27;Twilight 3&#x27;, and so on. What
do you think we&#x27;ll get next year?<br /><br />I&#x27;m not against franchises, I&#x27;ve even seen &#x27;Iron Man 2&#x27; three times. I
understand that it makes sense for Hollywood, because repeating a
successful formula has a better effort-profit ratio. The problem is
that every time a follow-up film is successful, originality dies a
little. What was the last original film you saw, that wasn&#x27;t a sequel,
or a remake, or adaptation of a book, comic or TV show; something that
tries to make it on its own merits without relying on gimmicks like
&#x22;THREE DEE&#x22;?<br /><br />Once in a while someone dares to make something different. Some get on
with it, some don&#x27;t - but those who do get a kick out of it. It
happens, but it is rare. Enter &#x27;Inception&#x27;, a sci-fi-
espionage-thriller that has been bouncing around in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
mind since around 1999.<br /><br />The premise is simple enough - Leonardo DiCaprio steals people&#x27;s
secrets by going into their dreams. One day, he has to insert
information instead of stealing it. How does he access into people&#x27;s
dreams? He has a machine. It&#x27;s not something we&#x27;re meant to dwell on,
just a plot device that conveniently allows our protagonists to do
impossible things (a bit like &#x22;the Force&#x22; in &#x27;Star Wars&#x27;).<br /><br />The narrative is where Nolan aims to mess with your mind. Several plots
occur at the same time, but they occur at different speeds, and what
happens in one has a direct impact on the next. There is no slow
introduction to make the audience feel at home, no set-up sequence to
establish characters. You are thrown right in and expected to make
sense of things as you go. There is little time to find your footing
because there is so much to take in. And just when you make sense of
things, Nolan begins playing with physics. The trailers already showed
glimpses of the visual treats on offer - water tilting 45 degrees in a
stationary glass, a city rising up and folding in on itself.
&#x27;Inception&#x27; takes the worlds created in &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; and dials it up to
11. The narrative complexity is such that those who go in expecting
&#x27;Batman 3&#x27; will be lost and disappointed.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t let the absence of superheroes fool you. &#x27;Inception&#x27; packs every
bit as much blockbuster boom as the average James Bond flick. Moving up
from his $5m budget for &#x27;Memento&#x27; in 2000, Nolan was given $200m to
play with. A stunt-heavy production thrashed the actors around for
weeks. Visual spectacle and narrative complexity rarely go
hand-in-hand. How complex is the plot in &#x27;Spider-Man&#x27;? How visually
spectacular was &#x27;Pulp Fiction&#x27;? It is usually a case of one or the
other. In &#x27;Inception&#x27;, the audience is treated to both.<br /><br />This is Nolan&#x27;s most ambitious project yet, but his narrative audacity
comes at a price. The downside to juggling so much is that it is often
difficult to grasp everything that is going on. It risks alienating a
percentage of the audience. Many elements are worthy of praise - Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s score is powerful but manages to avoid being the theme tune it
was in &#x27;Pirates Of The Caribbean&#x27;. Good cinematography. The acting is
convincing. The casting is spot-on. Unfortunately, audiences might be
far too busy to notice these things, at least on the first viewing.
Those who prefer simple stories should avoid this. Everyone else -
concentrate and you&#x27;re in for a merry ride.
