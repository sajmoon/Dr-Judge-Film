This film is overrated. Besides being accompanied by a score determined
to set you to sleep there&#x27;s really no filmmaking here that sets it
above the rest.<br /><br />The plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived.
However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the
audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience
is inept?<br /><br />The basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This
is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated
by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive
acting of the cast.<br /><br />No matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of
whether it was all a dream or not is not clever.
