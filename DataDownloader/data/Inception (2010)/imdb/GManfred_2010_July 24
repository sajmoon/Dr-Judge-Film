2010_July 24 
I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I&#x27;m too old for modern movies. I got roped into
this one by my son (I paid, of course). Long story short - he loved it,
I didn&#x27;t.<br /><br />This picture was breathtaking in its special effects and in its
director/writers imagination, but I couldn&#x27;t buy it for a minute. There
was no way possible I could, as they say, suspend my disbelief, no sir.
I was born at night but not last night. I looked around the theater
from time to time and watched as all the young people sat enthralled by
the spectacle before them, and I wished I was 14 again. But then, I
wasn&#x27;t ever that naive and jello-for-brains, even as a teenager.<br /><br />But it was a spectacle. I loved the nearly non-stop action and
hair-raising chases and near calamities throughout the picture. And I
appreciate the way Leonardo DeCaprio improves with each film. He is
sincere and a hard worker. I just felt foolish for getting in over (or
should I say under) my head with the younger set.
