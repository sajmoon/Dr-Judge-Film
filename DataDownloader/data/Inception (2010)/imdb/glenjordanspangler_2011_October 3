The Story Cobb (DiCaprio) and his partner (Gordon-Levitt) perform
corporate espionage by entering the dreams of executives and stealing
their sensitive information. A client (Watanabe) challenges them to go
a step further and plant a new idea into the mind of his business rival
(Murphy), a concept called &#x22;inception,&#x22; so they assemble a team.
Complicating it all is Cobb&#x27;s back-story. There are echoes here of
Shutter Island, and success where Solaris didn&#x27;t quite make it.<br /><br />Once again, Christopher Nolan is weird and brilliant. The intricate
story will challenge you, but it plays fairly by its own rules and
keeps you working at the puzzle. The special effects alone make it one
of the very few discs I could justify purchasing and watching again
every time you&#x27;re fortunate enough to come across another friend who
hasn&#x27;t seen it.<br /><br />Why you should see it You can&#x27;t wait to use your big HDTV to its full
advantage.<br /><br />Why you shouldn&#x27;t see it You still have that little thirteen-inch,
twenty-five-year old Emerson TV with rabbit-ears. Seriously, what are
you waiting for? --from my review at www.1man365movies.com
