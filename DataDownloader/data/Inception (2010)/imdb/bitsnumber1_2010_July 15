Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human
element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does.
The acting, from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio, is as good as it
gets. In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement,
Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the
movie of our dreams. world need directors like Nolan,Spielberg,Cameron,
As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors
who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio&#x27;s role
here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there&#x27;s
no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated
performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the
supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph
Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays
suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both
sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking
performance.<br /><br />But &#x22;Inception&#x22; is Nolan&#x27;s vision through and through- and in fact, a
visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan
spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and
complexity that makes &#x22;Inception&#x22; both an intellectual and visceral
enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which
have a special significance. With &#x22;Inception&#x22;, Nolan invites you to
open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities,
of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most
importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film
that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you&#x27;ll
want to experience it again immediately after you&#x27;ve seen it- just so
you can fully appreciate its genius.
