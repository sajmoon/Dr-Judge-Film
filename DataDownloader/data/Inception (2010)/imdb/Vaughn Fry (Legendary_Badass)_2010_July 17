Writer and director Christopher Nolan pulls together an all-star cast
for Inception, a mind- altering thriller. The film stars Leonard
DiCaprio as Cobb, the leader of a team of thieves who understand the
inner workings of dreams. Given the puzzling nature of the film, it&#x27;s
best just to say that the plot involves Cobb and his men implanting an
idea into the mind of a businessman&#x27;s rival in exchange for freedom to
see his children.<br /><br />The rules of dreams in Inception are staggeringly complicated. There is
talk about kicks and drops that early on fall of deaf ears but in
practice become very cool. The visuals are outstanding. Seeing a Paris
street fold over itself is about as realistic as one could expect. The
signature scene may be a zero gravity fight in a hotel that would make
astronauts jealous.<br /><br />It&#x27;s almost painful how little the actors in Inception have to do.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s Arthur gets to have the most fun handed to him
since he partakes in the aforementioned gravity defying sequence. Other
than that I can&#x27;t describe his character. The same goes for Ellen
Page&#x27;s Ariadne who logically has no business being in this film. Her
casting is something of an exercise in testing the audience. Is it
acceptable to have Velma from Scooby-Doo accompany the Oceans&#x27; Eleven
crew? These are talents in search of characters. If anything their
casting will have you disappointed that they don&#x27;t make heel turns and
betray Cobb over some cash, as that in the least would make Arthur and
Ariadne dynamic.<br /><br />Although Inception offers up heaps of originality, I have to say that
it was better the first time I saw it&#x97;when it was called The Matrix.
The two are very different plot wise and the obvious analogy is in
visual effects, but for me it has to do with how the elements of the
Matrix or dreams come to be revealed. In The Matrix much of the early
end of the movie is jarring. Neo, the protagonist, is then led into
believing that the world he knows is a lie. This approach attacks two
problems with one stone; it aligns the audience with Neo, and it gives
the characters in the know a reason to explain their world. The Neo of
Inception is Ariadne. Unfortunately her involvement with the movie is
trite, especially when you consider that Cobb&#x27;s team starts the film
with an architect. She is far from being the lead and her only
contribution is as a figure to ask questions on behalf of the audience.
The result is a bombardment of confusion. Characters are trying to pull
off a heist, but they constantly have to explain what&#x27;s happening to
Ariadne (the audience). A good heist film shouldn&#x27;t rely on spoken word
to communicate actions.<br /><br />Much can be said about the ending; it&#x27;s obviously left open for
interpretation. An earlier Nolan film by the title of Memento had an
ending that didn&#x27;t quite resolve every inquiry, but it was done in a
way tasteful enough that the audience knew what happened during the
movie. In Inception the audience is left with too many questions but
has to make an assumption about what happened just after the film cuts
to black. Maybe this is a new way to avoid criticism&#x97;if you can&#x27;t write
a good ending, just end the movie and let the audience do your work for
you. That&#x27;s why they call this approach cheap.<br /><br />Inception is a smart man&#x27;s movie repackaged for the commoner. The
concept and craftsmanship of filming techniques are strong enough to
award it favorably, but a cheapening ending and confusing approach
toward exposition dim the lights.
