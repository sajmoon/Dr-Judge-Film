Nolan gets lost/off in the baroque intricacies of his &#x22;mind-bending&#x22;
plot at the expense of pretty much everything else. The talents of the
many excellent actors thrown together to create this pretentious,
money-sucking crap are simply wasted. Don&#x27;t expect any fire from these
pieces of wood.<br /><br />Nolan asks the viewer to turn his brain on just enough to try to follow
the idea (you have to suffer through an unbearable amount of
exposition), but then hopes that enough action, effects and oppressive
soundtrack will stun that same brain into not questioning the
ridiculous character motives, sloppy plot contrivances, and breaking
and bending of his movie&#x27;s own rules. If you feel like you haven&#x27;t
heretofore been sufficiently crushed by suspension of disbelief and
reason, then this is your movie.<br /><br />As an aside, the movie felt like a converted book or graphic novel and
it&#x27;s likely this non-existent original medium would have allowed for a
more credible attempt at floating this turd.
