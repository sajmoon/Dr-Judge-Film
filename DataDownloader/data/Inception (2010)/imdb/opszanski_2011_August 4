I was shocked when I saw how many reviews were slamming this movie. To
be honest, that number isn&#x27;t very high, but the number of thumbs up for
those reviews is quite startling. I just just have one question; Why?<br /><br />There are actually people running around saying this film was stupid
and unintelligent. Really? This movie was stupid? Well let&#x27;s just hope
this pack of Einsteins don&#x27;t run into movies like Transformers: Rise of
the Fallen, their brains might melt. For all intensive purposes, this
movie is not stupid. On the contrary, I believe Inception to be one of
the smartest movies with a big budget. So many high grossing films have
the intellectual property of TV series and are constantly filled with
clich&#xE9;s and over hyped special effects. This movie has lots of special
effect too, but there is much brain mixed in with the brawn. Inception
is the first movie in a while that actually kept me thinking throughout
the film. Not only was it thought provoking, it was emotional and there
were plenty of times I was fascinated with with the story and the
acting was top notch.<br /><br />Others are saying that Christopher Nolan stole the idea for this movie
from Paprika, a Japanese Anime movie. To be honest, I haven&#x27;t seen this
so I can&#x27;t completely be trusted in my judgement. On the other hand, if
it&#x27;s anything like the trailer then there are some big differences. Yes
there are many similarities, but Paprika looks to be much more
imaginative and creative in terms of ideas. The movie looks more to be
a form of art as there is literally a dream world of possibilities that
take your emotions on an expressive roller coaster. I&#x27;m sorry, but the
cultural differences are too drastic to say Nolan is ripping off
Paprika. You could make the argument that he may have used their idea,
but you know what they say, an idea is the most resilient parasite.<br /><br />How anyone could be bored I have no idea. I suppose they couldn&#x27;t be
bothered to wake up and give some thought into a movie. These people
always seem to be the ones sitting in a theatre expecting the movie to
impress them specifically with no clear reason for their dismay.<br /><br />For the record, I don&#x27;t think this is the &#x22;best movie ever mad&#x22;, but I
know a good movie when I see one.<br /><br />With that said, Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He seems to
have been born without the ability to make bad movies. I have no doubt
he is the best current director here&#x27;s looking forward to the future of
entertainment we can all expect.
