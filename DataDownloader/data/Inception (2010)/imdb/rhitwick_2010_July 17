Inception 9/10 <br /><br />Plot: I&#x27;m not sure about it, but its something like this. Leo is a
specialist dream extraction. He generally employed by people to extract
info from someone&#x27;s subconscious mind. Now this guy Sato wants him to
plant an idea (rather extracting) in the victims mind. What happens
next is the story. Or better say how the things happen next is the
story. (I hope there is no spoiler in it.)<br /><br />Acting: Leo is brilliant, as I already told, he&#x27;s getting favorite
choice for weird movies. Rest of the casting Joseph Gordon-Levitt (of
500 Days of Summer), Ellen Page (of Hard Candy) are a few of new
recruits. Rest of the casting is from Nolan&#x27;s trusted group of actors.
Apart from Leo, I somehow can&#x27;t handpick anyone else to place next to
him. Everyone did awesome...<br /><br />Directing: This is whole new Nolan. U&#x27;ve experienced this level of
Nolan when u saw Memento, but with Inception he just surpassed every
prediction, every expectation ever made of him. IMO, he is adopting
David Lynch style only he cared to explain things. Please watch this
movie to believe what Nolan is. Kudos to him.<br /><br />Cinematography/Spl. effects: Cinematography is good. Special effects
needs a special mention. They never seemed bigger than the story,
blended properly, not outrageous.<br /><br />On the whole dream was never analyzed this way before, yes u will find
similarities with Matrix, Dark City (A scene of houses falling into
sea, reminded me of it) and a few other movies. But the movies
mentioned tried it superficially and Nolan went deep; levels of dream,
timeline, dream within dream within dream (and that is not mistakenly
repeated), architecture etc. whooooooo........I need to see it once
more. If &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22; made u think that was a brainfcuk movie,
then, ya...prepare for a brainsmashing one.
