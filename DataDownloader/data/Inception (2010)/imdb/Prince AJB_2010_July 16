Two years ago, Christopher Nolan brought in the highly successful &#x22;The
Dark Knight&#x22; to theaters and eventually becoming a box office legend
and also an acclaimed film. Now, Nolan steps away from the franchise
for a while to bring up a new sensation to the screen by &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; tells about Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) who&#x27;s skilled in stealing
ideas from other people&#x27;s minds or &#x22;extracting&#x22;. But, doing so has made
him lost many things such as his wife and having to not see his
children again. But, Saito (Watanabe) offers him a job instead of
stealing ideas to perform an &#x22;inception&#x22; or to plants one.<br /><br />I really liked &#x22;Inception&#x22;. The movie is so creative and smart that it
takes us to layers of dreams. Then, the characters go fight in their
dreams. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is absolutely going to be a classic.<br /><br />The acting was not bad at all. It was stunning and amazing. Leonardo
DiCaprio as Cobb was perfect. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and
etc., they&#x27;re also great. There was definitely no problem with the
acting.<br /><br />The special effects were also brilliant. The dream sequences were
real-like. Everything about the effects were cool.<br /><br />The fighting scenes in this movie were thrilling and exciting. Nolan
created these scenes beautifully. I really like the scenes. But, the
problem is that they&#x27;re just too long and that made the movie a bit
boring. But, it&#x27;s still fun to watch.<br /><br />The score is produced by the acclaimed Hans Zimmer. After scoring
&#x22;Sherlock Holmes&#x22; and other successful movies, he brings his brilliant
tunes to increase the thrills in &#x22;Inception&#x22;<br /><br />Next, I truly love the directing of Christopher Nolan. He&#x27;s sure going
to end up as a legendary film maker. He directs every single move
perfectly. He creates the dreams carefully. After Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22;
has been watched by the world, he&#x27;s sure going gain more fame.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a movie you don&#x27;t want to miss this summer 2010. I also
think that &#x22;Inception&#x22; might receive some &#x22;Oscar&#x22; nominations. Overall,
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a rare summer blockbuster you will ever watch. I award
this movie a score of ten stars. Nolan should be proud of his works.<br /><br />Since this movie explains an &#x22;inception&#x22; as planting one idea, a
question struck my head. Did they perform an &#x22;inception&#x22; on my mind?
