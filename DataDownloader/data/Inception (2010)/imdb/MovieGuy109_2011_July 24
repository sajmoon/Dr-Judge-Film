I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight
than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not
good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by
Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I
prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The
film&#x27;s main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream,
only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated
explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however
it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent
screen writing.
