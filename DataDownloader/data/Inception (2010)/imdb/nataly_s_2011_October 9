Compared to Avatar and all its hype, this was a masterpiece. But
compared to other sci-fi movies, it wasn&#x27;t that good, at least
plot-wise. The effects and all the settings were magnificent, really. I
enjoyed every part of this skillfully created mind game. But apart from
the brilliant premise, the execution of the plot and characters weren&#x27;t
top notch quality.<br /><br />When you have such a fantastic and unique idea of a creation, you don&#x27;t
waste time with your typical romance drama, as someone would have done
in a drama focused movie(it wasn&#x27;t even executed well). See...you can&#x27;t
have everything in 2 to 3 hours. You have to choose what your main
ideas are and then hold tightly to them for dear life, never let them
go or the magic&#x27;s gone too. From the moment romance started having more
airing time than it should, that was game over..<br /><br />What I&#x27;m saying is that the romance didn&#x27;t make the characters deeper,
it only wasted tremendous potential, which still makes me angry to
think about. But.. this is a movie about people, so emotions are part
of the game, right? someone could argue. You are not wrong, but I ask
you this: If you had a slice of the finest cheese on Earth to eat,
would you mix it up with other stuff, just because it&#x27;s all food, or
make the CHEESE the center of everything? I just wanted more cheese and
less half cooked side dishes.<br /><br />And I&#x27;m sorry to say I didn&#x27;t like Marion Cotillard in this movie. She
was obviously selected for her skills to bring out many old fashioned
type emotions with her acting, cause she does have that effect on
camera, but it didn&#x27;t work well in this thrilling sci-fi movie, her
chemistry with Di Caprio wasn&#x27;t even good to begin with. Which brings
me again to my conclusion that this movie needed much sharper reflexes
and less personal drama.<br /><br />On another note, what was really riveting about this movie was its
music, which worked perfectly with the awestrucking scenery.<br /><br />Groundbreaking? No. Worth Watching? Yes.
