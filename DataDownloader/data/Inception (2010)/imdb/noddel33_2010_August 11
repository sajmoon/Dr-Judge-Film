The best action movie of summer 2010 goes to Inception... Inception was
amazing.. It was the best Christopher Nolan film since batman... I so
loved inception i am still trying to figure it out like most other
people are trying to figure it out like me...I so want to see this
movie again on DVD to see the special effects and to see the deleted
scenery and to see the interview with Christopher Nolan to see how he
created and though of a movie like Inception... Joseph Gordon Levitt
was the best person in this movie and he is the best new young
person... Leonardo DiCaprio was always good like he always it... The
best action movie of summer 2010
