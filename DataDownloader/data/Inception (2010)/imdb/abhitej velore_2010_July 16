the trailers were mesmerising , the music was awesome and finally the
film itself ! after &#x22;conditioning my mind&#x22; to not expect a lot i went
into the movie, and wow , was i in for a pleasant surprise, all my
thought of about the movie had vanished, as all i had in mind was the
movie itself. superb story telling ! from the first shot to the final
shot the film takes you to loads of amazing places but be warned, it
never gives a break. the film travels at a really fast pace and
requires quite some attention from the audience, it wants the audience
to view it and then anticipate, feel, react, digest. not just another
action fest. well, the plot, we all know the plot by now, Dom Cobb is
an extraction specialist etc etc. but the real depth in the movie is
the plot detail, as to how every aspect of the plots plausibility is
thought out and put on a grand scale in front of the viewers. the
performances are flawless and as expected Leo takes center stage.<br /><br />a special mention would be the back ground score to the movie, Hans
zimmer has truly created a score that live up to the complexities of
the movie, but in its own simple rhythmic way. its always there
enhancing your experience , but never really seen.<br /><br />don&#x27;t miss this movie if: you&#x27;ve liked Nolan&#x27;s works before
psychological thrillers are your genre you just want to watch some
great film making you just wanna see some action ( but you&#x27;l get a lot
more than you bargained for !) your bored of remakes/reboots r whatever<br /><br />skip it if: your doc asked you to cos you&#x27;re hospitalized ! (id still
try)<br /><br />expect what you may, i wont say don&#x27;t go in with high expectations, or
i wont even say &#x22;keep ur mind free&#x22; r stuff like that, cos the movie
will engulf you when it begins !!! beware !!!!
