For 2 hours, 14 minutes and 50 seconds this was an incredible movie. A
perfect 10. There were flawless effects, creative and beautiful. A
complex story that was still comprehensible, it begged to be watched
again and again. Good acting for fun and interesting characters. Drama,
humor, action, everything you could want from a movie. Usual Suspects
crossed with Gattaca crossed with James Bond... just great.<br /><br />So why the vote of 8? <br /><br />A weak, indecisive, pathetic, lousy, pick-your-derogatory-adjective 10
second ending. I am not alone in my opinion, the majority of the
audience scoffed, jeered or sighed in disgust at the final scene. A
proper ending was possible. Two endings as a matter of fact. I had one
preference, some may have chosen the other option, but too not
choose... it&#x27;s the worse offence. My preferred ending would have
garnered this film a 10, the other ending a 9, the lack of ending
brought it all the way down to an 8 and I&#x27;ll certainly never purchase
this on DVD. So disappointing.
