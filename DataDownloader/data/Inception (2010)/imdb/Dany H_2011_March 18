Few movies can manage to have an entire audience with their mouths wide
open every single minute it lasts. Yet, when I saw this film last year,
I wasn&#x27;t the only one who just simply couldn&#x27;t take her eyes from the
screen afraid they might lose a second of this truly amazing film.<br /><br />As stated before, Inception is a master-piece in the whole sense of the
word. All the details are so carefully treated and sculpted throughout
the film and I find it hard to name a single mistake or spot that I
didn&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s difficult to imagine Nolan could succeed the
greatness of &#x22;The Dark Night&#x22; but with Inception he has managed to
place himself as one of the most important and creative film-makers of
our time.<br /><br />The film combines both effects (sound, visual, score) with a plot that
sometimes seems to have been taken from another planet and a brilliant
acting from all the cast.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not afraid to be wrong if I said this is bound to become a classic
because all facts indicate that it is highly possible. And I hope that
in 20 years, this film is considered one of the best ever because it&#x27;s
certainly is.<br /><br />10 out of 10 with no doubt.
