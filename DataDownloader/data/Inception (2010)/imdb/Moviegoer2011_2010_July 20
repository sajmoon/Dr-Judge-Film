I think all the other 1 star voters stated exactly how I feel about
this movie. I have never felt motivated to write a movie review in my
life. This was one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen! My favorite
movie reviewer gave it 4/4 stars. I am baffled - - I really feel like
I&#x27;m missing something... although there seem to be many out there that
have the same thoughts I do. Thanks for confirming my opinions! I could
tell within five minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it
and that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to follow it. Should have walked out then.
I am the most sympathetic person to characters in a movie. I was amazed
that I couldn&#x27;t care less if all of the main characters were shot dead.
There was zero character development. I felt a bit nauseous from all of
the action and I really coudn&#x27;t tell what was going on a lot of the
time.
