2011_January 7 
Movie was so well/smoothly paced I give 10 out of 10 for directing. I
wish more movies would be this way, so I don&#x27;t end up asleep or leaving
the cinema before the end of the movie. Story is very simple and I like
that. And movie is focused on the development/inception of an idea, and
not very focused of character development, which I think was
preferable, to prevent making movie too complex and over-paced/rushed.
And I think that main character of this movie was the concept of an
idea. Which they tried to explain in action. I rather liked when they
1st explain some concept/aspect and then show it in actuality. This was
forcing me pay more attention to that.
