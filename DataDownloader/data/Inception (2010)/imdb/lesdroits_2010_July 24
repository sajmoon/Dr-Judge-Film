Hate when this happens, as it did for Fish Called Wanda when everyone
else in the universe loved it.<br /><br />Husband and I went to see last night, all excited. Last 45 minutes
(after they for no reason I could figure out went to the snow world
with more guns blasting) such a total bore, on a par with my old
corporations class. We both considered walking out, could hardly make
it through.<br /><br />Interesting original premise. Dreams are fascinating, unexplored
realms. But the movie made by one with little talent for screen
writing/moving making --to me -- needed some breaks in the action (see
Shakespeare), and some much needed explanation such as how they started
from the first moment being able to be in each others&#x27; dreams. And the
little girlie -- &#x22;super architect?&#x22; Silly. She had no role. All the
constant shoot-em-up--unnecessary--and headache-inducingly noisy. This
could have been interesting if not combined with some modern day cowboy
backdrop -- more story, less frenetic action. <br /><br />In short -- what on earth has everyone so excited? Heard someone
outside the theater after discussing from which I concluded it&#x27;s like
the emperor&#x27;s new clothes, no one wants to criticize for fear of
seeming stupid. Well, stupid here. This sucked.
