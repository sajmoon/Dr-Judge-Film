I won&#x27;t necessarily bash the movie itself, more like the people who
have made this movie number 3 on the top 250. It reminds me of people
who have read the Twilight series. They think the books are
phenomenal... That&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t read much of anything else...
When I saw Inception, I was reminded of the Matrix. The Matrix has
similar concepts, but it didn&#x27;t get the attention Inception got. It was
more complex and because of that, people didn&#x27;t understand it, and what
we don&#x27;t understand, we don&#x27;t like. Eh, people like Inception because
they understand it. If you like cool sci-fi movies, you have to see Mr.
Nobody. Now THAT was a good movie.
