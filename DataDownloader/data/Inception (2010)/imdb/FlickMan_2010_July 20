2010_July 20 
I just saw this a few hours ago, and while I enjoyed it, I don&#x27;t think
it&#x27;s up there with the all-time greats. Yes, the special effects are
top-notch, but the story line is unnecessarily convoluted and the movie
is too derivative to win any prizes for conceptual breakthroughs. If
you&#x27;ve seen The Matrix, Dark City, Eternal Sunshine, and Blade Runner
you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve covered a lot of this territory before. And
having three (four? five?) levels of dream/reality/whatever eventually
becomes more distracting than intriguing. The process of &#x22;kicking&#x22;
between different levels - why and how it works, or doesn&#x27;t - is not
explained convincingly or consistently.<br /><br />All that aside, however, the main problem for me was that there&#x27;s
little reason to care much about Cobb, the main character. For all the
talk of emotions and psyche, we learn surprisingly little about Cobb.
We are told that he is driven by the hope of &#x22;going home,&#x22; and the
scenes with him and his lost wife are meant to evoke empathy, but for
me they fell surprisingly flat. And finally, I just couldn&#x27;t buy into
Ellen Page as the &#x22;architect.&#x22; She&#x27;s too young to be the designer of
dreamworlds, and I kept wishing that they&#x27;d cast an older, wiser actor
in that role. Yeah, I know, they wanted at least one young/cute female
in the movie, but ... Ellen Page? Sooo ... 8/10 is all I can give this
movie. Worth seeing on the big screen, maybe even more than once, but
not Nolan&#x27;s best.
