Inception, another film surrounded by huge hype but doesn&#x27;t fulfils my
expectation. The film is undoubtedly very good but just not that good.
The main question that many asks before watching Inception is, &#x22;Is this
film intelligent&#x22;. The answer is simply yes but also no. The story is
original but you don&#x27;t need a I.Q above average to fully understand
this film. There just a lot of information thrown into the film that if
one loses concentration he may easily find himself lost. But if you
keep up with everything then the film is rewarding and simple.<br /><br />The acting is what you expect when you read the casting list. Dicaprio
does a fine performance and is defiantly maturing. But there one main
problem, the characters are hard to like. You don&#x27;t hate them or love
them but instead just listen to them talking about lots of things for
two and half hours and eventually you can&#x27;t help but wish the film will
end. The shootouts were dull with very little creativity put in them.
In fact the whole last act dragged far way to long.<br /><br />For me Inception is above average thriller. I can&#x27;t see myself pulling
the DVD off my shelve and encouraging people to watch it in years to
come. There a lot of information being thrown at you and it extremely
easy to lost your footing. Inception as a novel would of been an best
seller but as a film, it rather messy.
