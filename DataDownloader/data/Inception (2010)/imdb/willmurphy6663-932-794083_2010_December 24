hi as ever when you start writing here its because you have had a
strong reaction one way or another. the strong reaction here is that
the film gets a 9 out of 10 rating and this is way way too high. the
film uses the Freudian idea of the mind as having depth, multi layered
and having defenses he uses this idea to create an action film. the
idea of defense means that the director spends literally long periods
of the film with people shooting each other as the defense attacks the
people coming into the mind. as a result this is a one dimensional look
at dreams, so its James bond meets psychology...it really doesn&#x27;t
work.....don&#x27;t believe the hype<br /><br />thanks will &#x26; vero
