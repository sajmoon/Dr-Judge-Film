when some one says that a movie surpasses all your expectations no
matter how high they are... as a matter of fact very few movies really
do it... this movie is one of them. With this movie Nolan, perhaps one
of the finest directors of all time creates himself a new genre which
defies all the other ones. Science fictions with dramatic stories and
improvisations surrounded with intellectual aura. Some say that 4-D
cant be done. This movie undoes that belief too. You can feel the aura
of beauty surrounding you while watching the movie. <br /><br />Nolan has improvised himself on all aspects of movie making. The seat
gripping scenes, amazing dialogs and the spectacular movie telling is
quite evident on the screen. The story races with an amazing speed but
manages to keep you to be right on the track. The movie comes up with a
rare collaboration of perfection in all aspects. DiCaprio dazzles with
another award winning performance. I would really feel sorry for the
Oscars if they miss the privilege to honor him this year. <br /><br />People tend to compare this with a segment of classics like the matrix,
star-wars. Well actually it surpasses them all. These movies are based
on an IDEA. And they stop at there. A single idea and the story is
segmented on that. Nolan has the impeccable capacity to pick up a
dramatic story with in an idea an build a piece of art from it. Thats
what distinguishes him from the herd. This movie is another such movie,
though this is not exactly another movie.<br /><br />Watch this movie in the theaters. You really need to kill piracy for
this movie. Final verdict... 10/10
