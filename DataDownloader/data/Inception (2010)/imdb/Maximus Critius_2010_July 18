I have the highest of regards for Nolan, his vision, Di Caprio and
other individuals involved in the project. But seriously...what was
that?<br /><br />Re-hash of existing ideas, poor editing, emotionless dialogs and lack
of &#x22;film&#x22; feel. <br /><br />It would have been better as an animated movie. <br /><br />Leo was not caste right for this role. He needed someone older/mature
for this. Norton, Clooney, Daniel Day Lewis, Denzel...would have been
much better for this.<br /><br />In the end, you have 2001 Space Odyssey, Goodfellas, Shutter Island,
Matrix and Memento in one script...which is just puke after eating good
food from different cuisines. <br /><br />I bet Twilight fans are happy. I was banking upon this film to show-off
what real cinema is. But sorry, Nolan better get back to basics and
keep things simple and relative. That is what he is good at. This was
Micheal Bay movie...not Nolan&#x27;s.<br /><br />All I can say is, after reading 100s of positive reviews and the hype,
this movie should be re-named Deception...
