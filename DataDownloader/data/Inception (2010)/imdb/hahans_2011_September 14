Possibly the most original movie of a generation. Filled with twists
and turns in a world we could only dream of.<br /><br />The story Chris Nolan imposes is so entrancing that just about anyone
will find themselves on the edge of their seat throughout the whole
movie questioning what is and what isn&#x27;t reality.<br /><br />For those of you who have seen it, we all know the most important part
of the movie is the end, for those of you who haven&#x27;t you are in for an
ending that is simultaneously one of the best and most questionable
endings in cinematic history.<br /><br />As you watch the movie you must remember: &#x22;Dreams feel real while we&#x27;re
in them. It&#x27;s only when we wake up that we realize something was
actually strange.&#x22; ~ Cobb <br /><br />10/10 For originality, suspense, acting abilities, and longevity.
