Christoper Nolan proves his class once again with Inception. The main
highlight of the film is the screenplay and editing. The cast always
delivers in Nolan&#x27;s movie, which is repeated again. No one could have
done a better job than DiCaprio as a rusty thief,Cobb. There are some
truly great casting such as Ellen Page,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Tom
Hardy,Cillian Murphy. We could sense Christopher Nolan in each frame.
Christopher Nolan proves his originality in this movie. Another main
highlight is the music of the movie, composed by Hans Zimmer. <br /><br />If you miss movie like this then there is no meaning in watching
movies.
