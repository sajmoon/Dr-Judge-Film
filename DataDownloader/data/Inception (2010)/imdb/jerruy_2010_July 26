Yes it is clever, but the plot is predictable and not nearly as hard to
articulate as people are making out.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic and the story line is interesting but
there is no way this film should be up there with the likes of the
Godfather and the Matrix.<br /><br />The actors have been cast well and the musical score is fantastic and
really adds to the suspense and impact of some of the scenes. DiCaprio
in this movie again shows why he has rightly taken his place as one of
Hollywood&#x27;s biggest names. <br /><br />Yeah its good film and you should go see it, but it is not as great a
movie as many believe.
