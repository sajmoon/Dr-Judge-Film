I went into this film expecting a sci-fi/thriller concept film ala &#x22;The
Matrix&#x22;. And although this film&#x27;s pseudo-science and visual spectacle
initially reaffirm this expectation, the end result ends up having more
in common with &#x22;The Sting&#x22; than anything sci-fi.<br /><br />The performances are all very strong, especially Tom Hardy as a
Brit-grunge spy. The direction is tight and the screenplay completes
all the necessary plot points by the film&#x27;s end--even if the plot seems
incomprehensible at times. The production values; from the costumes,
the international locations, the lush and sometimes bleak sets and the
over-top special effects are all near perfection. But wrapped up inside
this gloriously grandiose package is a nice little con-game film.<br /><br />Basically a bunch of guys conspire through elaborate means to convince
someone of something that isn&#x27;t and make sure the get-away is clean.
The fact that it all takes place in one&#x27;s dreams is the sweetness in
the cake. And, of course, the audience is engagingly left to sort
through the various actions, motives, and sub-plots to find order in
the chaos.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has already proved his chops with high-concept films
like &#x22;Memento&#x22; and &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; so it&#x27;s really no surprise that this
big-budget film is a success. Thankfully the more bankable &#x22;Batman&#x22;
films have given his ideas room to breathe and every extra penny shows
on the screen.<br /><br />Now the little issues. First--Cillian Murphy&#x27;s character, the &#x27;mark&#x27;,
is an unworthy opponent. He provides almost no challenge to the
characters and their scheme. This leaves a film without an antagonist.
Leading to my second problem--the only obstacles to these characters is
the baggage they themselves bring to the various tasks at hand,
particularly Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s Cobb. It makes the entire film more a
study on his neurosis than any real challenge presented by the story.
Not to say there isn&#x27;t any conflict resolution, there is in perfect
things-gone-awry fashion. Just that Cobb and his merry men could&#x27;ve
gone to group therapy instead?!<br /><br />Overcome these small issues and sit back and enjoy the ride. This film
is the best of it&#x27;s kind since &#x22;The Sting&#x22;.
