&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a masterful film that will never ever be for
everyone...but what film ever is, or intended to be. I run out of words
when it comes to films like &#x22;Inception&#x22; that are truly beautiful mind
blowing pieces of cinema. I can honestly say &#x22;Inception&#x22; brought out
true emotions that most films very rarely do. Leaving me wanting more.
Almost the moment the film ended I was ready for another viewing. Very
very few films make me feel such as this. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is the exception
.I grapple with the reasons a good book or piece of cinema like
&#x22;Inception&#x22; can bring me almost as much pleasure as a walk on the beach
or a beautiful spring day. Good or bad right or wrong this is what well
done art or cinema does for me.&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a keeper.<br /><br />Change is Inevitable Growth is Optional
