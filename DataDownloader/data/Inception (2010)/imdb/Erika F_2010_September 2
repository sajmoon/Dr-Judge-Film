worst film I saw in a very long time I would have given it a 6 if it
wasn&#x27;t for trying to bring down the hype. It is boring &#x26; slow no story
Some people told me it is a good and complicated movie. They belong to
the group of dumb people who like feel as though they&#x27;re intelligent
This thing is in the top 3 of best movies ever ??? then I do not need
to see any movie ever again they are a waste of money and time and yes
I did get the plot - it is missing and for those who still want to see
this movie don&#x27;t worry it is not complicated A very personal idea, if I
do not look at my watch during the movie it was entertaining (does not
have to be good but it caught you) but during this waste of time I have
seen the seconds on my watch crawl forward.
