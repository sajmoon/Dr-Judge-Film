The moving is a&#x27;Maze&#x27;ing and you will come out of the maze (read
cinema) in just a tad less than 2 and half hours, fully refreshed and
satisfied. Watched the first show of the day at 12 noon (India Time)
which I guess means it is yet to be released in US while I am writing
the review.<br /><br />Another DiCaprio thriller after Shutter Island and that too in the same
year. DiCaprio has done just 11 movies since Titanic came out in 1997
and probably you can name them all, he is that selective). Too good to
be true. Actually it is too good as although you cant and shouldn&#x27;t
compare, Christopher Nolan has matched Martin Scorsese and has probably
outdone himself compared to TDK. Forget the complexity about the plot
of a dream within a dream within a dream, what will linger are the
amazing visuals caught in slo-mo. Everything seems to fall in place
like a Swiss watch that by the end of the movie all your questions and
&#x27;how did that&#x27; gets answered.<br /><br />There is a lot of similarity between Inception and Shutter Island and
the similarity is that they are like North and South Poles. That
different yet nonetheless they are poles, right.<br /><br />I do not want to give the story one bit because that is the beauty of
this movie&#x27;s concept, the story unfolds with almost every scene and
there is always the suspense that the story just might take a dramatic
turn in each frame and does it take the turn or turns? Well, go watch
for yourself and you will feel like writing a review yourself.<br /><br />All the actors are good and plays to the character, but the thing is
the movie is so damn brilliant, I guess Nolan could have just about
cast anybody and it would still have turned out a&#x27;Maze&#x27;ing.
