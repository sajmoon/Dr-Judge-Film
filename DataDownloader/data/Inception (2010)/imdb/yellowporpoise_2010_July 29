This movie left me amazed and in a great mood. So often in the last
years I have walked into the cinema and hoped for entertainment and so
often I was disappointed. Movies like this will happen every 5-10
years. Matrix and Avatar were one of those movies. They are creating
something new and raising a new standard. The industry needs those
movies and the movie fans need those movies. I hated Di Caprio till
yesterday evening. I think that his acting in inception was very good.
The soundtrack, the special effects, the script, everything worked
together and created a very special movie. The clever script, and the
emotional story of his wife, the action scenes...just the perfect
movie. <br /><br />I can not understand that some people will only give one star. This
movie was nothing special? Well the soundtrack and special effects
might deserve at least 5 stars. This movie is not on the same level as
&#x22;Howard the duck&#x22; or &#x22;Catwoman&#x22;. Those movies were one star movies, but
definitely not &#x22;Inception&#x22;. It is not a fair review to do so.
