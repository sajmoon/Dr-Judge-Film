The movie is standalone awesome, not taking anything away from the
beautiful performances. I have to say that Mr. Nolan does not fail to
amaze. This time reaching the zenith of all expectations. Leo does a
splendid job but i would say this role did not push his acting skills
to the limits like Blood Diamond or even The Departed. But as i
mentioned in the first line, the concept and the story line is so
brilliant that even if there was no Leonardo DiCaprio in it, I would
still give this movie a 9/10. There were some loopholes like in every
movie, but that can be ignored for Its easy to criticize but difficult
to create. Final Word - A must watch movie.
