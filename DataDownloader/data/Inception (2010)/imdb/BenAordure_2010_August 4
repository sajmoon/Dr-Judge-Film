Briefly, a high skilled ideas-thief has to implement an idea, a kind of
order in fact, to a very powerful person, through dreams.<br /><br />To achieve this assignment, Cobb (Di Caprio) needs to use a special
team and a high risked method. This is the pretext for providing many
actions, many explosions. So many that it knock you down, and I nearly
fell asleep ... which is not a good sign ! I would have expected a more
calm, more reflexion-focused storyboard. The cast is OK but I would not
have chosen Di Caprio for the main role. He acts good but I don&#x27;t see
him as a ideas-thief. For this kind of scientific mission, I would have
imagined someone more geeky, more cerebral. Happily, and as usual with
Nolan, the visual is fantastic. Majestic, polished : impressive. This
saves the film and makes it something watchable but not more. I review
this film now because I&#x27;m afraid to forget it quickly !
