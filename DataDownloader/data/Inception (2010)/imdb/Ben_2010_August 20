I would like to warn everyone that this movie is seriously overrated.
Based on the rating here I decided to see it in the cinema, I wish I
hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not entertaining and plain boring, and much too long and
repetitive. The characters are boring and very plain. It&#x27;s almost like
watching a couple of zombies of watching paint dry. It could have
easily been an hour shorter. Plot holes are all over the place, nothing
is properly explained and it&#x27;s nothing but philosophical mumbo jumbo.
Even the action was boring and unexceptional. I wouldn&#x27;t even see it
again if they paid me to do so (although maybe for enough cash I
would). A large part of the audience that was in the theatre with me
seemed to agree, because I heard only negative reactions. I gave it a 1
because a 9 is seriously overrated.
