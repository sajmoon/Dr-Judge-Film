Watch South Park&#x27;s take on this...It looks nice, but it is totally
incoherent. Just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. Music used
to manipulate, not enhance. I am going to fill the rest of this review
with words because I am required to do so by the site. This review will
perfectly mirror the movie as a result, because after the first two
lines there is absolutely, positively, without question not an angstrom
of a reason for you to continue reading. It&#x27;s just that I hate this
movie so much that I am willing to waste my time typing like this so as
to bring the ratings down even in this sadly microscopic way since it
is overwhelmingly loved for reasons that are just simply beyond my
small little mind. Are we at ten lines yet? Whew.
