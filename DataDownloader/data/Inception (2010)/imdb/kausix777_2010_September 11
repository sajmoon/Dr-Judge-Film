I really would give it 9 or more as others have, if it were only the
concept I thought of. It&#x27;s really amazing to have thought of this AND
to have thought of actually putting this up on screen.<br /><br />However, I take a few points off that because I was somewhat
disappointed with the storytelling.<br /><br />I personally prefer a linear story especially when the plot is complex.
Explaining things in bits and pieces and flashback are nice filmmaking
techniques but I don&#x27;t like them when used with complex plots,
especially when the simplicity is lost.<br /><br />I also did not appreciate the idea of lengthening the last few scenes
since the action was quite average and boring. Anyway, with all the
expectation generated by its reviews, I had NOT come in to watch an
action-fest. They could have simplified those scenes.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why they decided not to have a 3D for this one. This is
one where 3D actually makes sense since the buildup was nice.
