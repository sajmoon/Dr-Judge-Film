Inception is one of those movies that &#x22;engaged&#x22; film-goers will mistake
for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are
three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently
engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as
much as the Bourne Identity. They don&#x27;t go to the movies to think, they
go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged
people think they know what they&#x27;re talking about, and generally love
movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to
understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They
believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don&#x27;t
quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off.
Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of
Inception, but also recognize it&#x27;s a little sloppy, self-serious, over
drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don&#x27;t pretend like
it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people
who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception
is a &#x27;masterpiece&#x27; and that they know everything about movies. They
don&#x27;t. Inception is clever, but it doesn&#x27;t rank anything above
respectable.<br /><br />The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer
mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at
entering people&#x27;s minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this
case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so
exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn&#x27;t
care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic
wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the
midway point), things fall apart.<br /><br />The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is
seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they&#x27;re trying to
break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich
CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back
to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes
it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get
caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.<br /><br />When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside
the climax), I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan
makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals
suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at
least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this
serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up.
There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel
actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can&#x27;t decide what channel to
watch. It&#x27;s mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of
these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy
running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15
minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking
more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.<br /><br />For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of
Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely
human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife.
This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more
incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in
keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo&#x27;s wife is real or
just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it&#x27;s awfully
clever, but it&#x27;s hard to feel emotion towards characters that you&#x27;re
not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the
unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan
attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and
a climaxing score. <br /><br />Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with
Inception&#x27;s shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all
of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception&#x27;s pure style
and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially
in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in
slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim,
but it&#x27;s not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don&#x27;t expect to dream
about it afterwards.
