The visuals in the first third of the movie are stunning. But then the
story gets in the way. The multi-layered experience of the characters
is so spoiled by all the crashes, shooting, and gratuitous
action/violence. DiCaprio is doing a lot of weird stuff these days. See
Shutter Island, for example. And he is better than this. I think this
movie was made for adolescent boys. In the screening I saw they made up
2/3 of the audience. And they loved it. But I didn&#x27;t hear any girls or
women praising it. Altogether the cast was very good but they had
little to do except go with the narrative. And it&#x27;s a poor narrative.
Boo.
