While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one
deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and
errant grammar and punctuation: it&#x27;s effects tire and it seems less
than it wishes it to be.<br /><br />The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a
&#x27;reductio&#x27; argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is
absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like
Wittgenstein&#x27;s proof against skepticism) but it&#x27;s true failing is not
that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot
devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense
or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or
emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary
logician&#x27;s game.<br /><br />Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the
author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an
astute review of his major work, &#x22;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&#x22;, in which he
ridiculed the ease of such writing; it&#x27;s deceptive cleverness; it&#x27;s
egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like
anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically. <br /><br />Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable.
