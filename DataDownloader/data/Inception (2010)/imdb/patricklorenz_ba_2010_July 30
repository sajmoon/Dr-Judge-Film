This one&#x27;s ridiculously overrated. Am I dreaming? This can&#x27;t be true.
This movie is nothing but a bubble with endless uninspired action
scenes and nonsense and explaining dialogs. There&#x27;s nearly no plot
existing, there&#x27;s no logic, but this doesn&#x27;t matter and isn&#x27;t
necessary. Nolan is a great director, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; was a great
flick, but beside Cobbs trauma regarding his wife, there&#x27;s nothing
interesting or touching in this piece of film. And except the fantastic
hotel fight, there&#x27;s nothing thrilling at all. It&#x27;s not innovative nor
is it a masterpiece. The hype is unjustified and &#x22;Inception&#x22; belongs
not even in the Top 50 of the best movies of all time.
