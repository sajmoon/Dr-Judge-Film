When Inception came out in cinemas I have to admit I was excited.
However I never got round to seeing it, at the time I wasn&#x27;t actually
that disappointed because I had heard it was quite confusing, too
confusing some people said. But when I did see it a couple of months
after it won three awards at the Oscars I didn&#x27;t agree. Complex? Yes.
But confusing? No. Christopher Nolan&#x27;s script weaves its way through a
dream world and at times loses it coherency because some ideas just
don&#x27;t make sense in our minds. But after the film has finished, like
any good thriller it waits until the end, everything makes sense. If
you think hard enough. Inception is like earlier Nolan films e.g. The
Prestige, in the way that it is very complex and unless you watch
intensely and focus on subtle plot points, the film may not make sense.
Nolan however, does not let these plot points whizz by with good
direction. Quality performances by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role
of Cobb and the rest of the ensemble cast built up over time by Nolan.
A cast that should be perfected in time for The Dark Knight Rises. If
you add stunning CGI to this already winning formula, you have a great
action, sci-fi blockbuster.
