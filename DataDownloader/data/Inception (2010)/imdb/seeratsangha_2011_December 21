I was reading through the Inception FAQ&#x27;s and came across this
question: &#x22;Was the end a dream or reality?&#x22;<br /><br />The answer held a lot of amazing explanations and two theories: the
ending was reality or the ending was a dream. At the end of the
explanation for the &#x27;ending being a dream&#x27;, the text says: &#x22;Also: This
may be a continuity error, but when Arthur comes to get Cobb in Tokyo,
they leave the hotel room and go to the roof for the helicopter at
night. When they&#x27;re on the roof, it&#x27;s day.&#x22;<br /><br />I just wanted to point out that at the time Arthur comes to pick up
Cobb, it&#x27;s pitch black, and when they&#x27;re on the roof, it&#x27;s brighter, as
a result of a new day. Meaning, the sun is about to come up, that&#x27;s why
it&#x27;s day by the time they reach the rooftop. For example, Cobb and
Arthur could&#x27;ve been awake at like 4:30-5:00 AM at the time he&#x27;s
talking to his kids (plus, his kids could only call him during the
afternoon in Los Angeles, where his kids live, due to the time zone)
and by the time they reach the rooftop, it&#x27;s like 5:30-6:00 AM,
indicating the arrival of dawn.<br /><br />I wanted to edit my idea/theory into the FAQ, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay
with my credit card, so I thought I&#x27;d just write it here :) What are
your thoughts?! O:
