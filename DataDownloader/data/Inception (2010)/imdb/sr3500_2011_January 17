I enjoy films like Waking Life, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, etc., because
of their examination of the personal experience of &#x22;real&#x22;. I expected
this movie to involve my brain more, but I actually found it to be more
satisfying to the senses. From the start, the pacing is stimulating.
Visually, it&#x27;s very impressive, at times. I usually don&#x27;t like a film&#x27;s
score to be as intrusive as this film&#x27;s could seem to be, but the use
of score and slow-mo and sound fx made for some pretty taut moments; it
was very well crafted, in that regard. Leo is &#x22;tortured Leo&#x22;, and that
is to say, he was okay. I like Ellen Page, I really do, but excepting
after we first meet her, she didn&#x27;t bring a whole lot that someone else
couldn&#x27;t have brought (I actually suspected that she got the job so
that Leo had a female lead to tower over, but I see that he&#x27;s almost
6&#x27;, so I guess that&#x27;s not it). I keep hearing favorable critical
appraisal for the things that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has done since 3rd
Rock (a show I hate like poison), and I see now that it&#x27;s deserved - I
think he did the best job of the lot. Tom Hardy impresses too, in a
smaller role.<br /><br />I wanted this movie to compel me to think more. I can&#x27;t complain for
the experience, though. It makes you think some, your senses are
satisfied, and it quickens the pulse. Not bad.
