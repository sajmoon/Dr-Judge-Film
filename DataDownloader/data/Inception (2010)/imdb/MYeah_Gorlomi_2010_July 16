With the exception of the incredible Toy Story 3, the Summer movie
season has been looking good, but not particularly great. All I can say
is, thank God for Christopher Nolan, who has upped the season with a
film that ranks among his very best work.<br /><br />Inception takes place in a world where technology exists to enter the
mind. Dom Cobb (Played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor, and the
best at what he does: stealing ideas from people&#x27;s heads. He is asked
by a businessman named Saito (Played by Ken Watanabe), to perform
Inception, to PLACE an idea in the mind of a rival company&#x27;s heir,
Robert Fischer (Played by Cillian Murphy). To do this, he assembles a
team, such as team point man Arthur (Played by Jospeh Gordon-Levitt),
forger Eames (Tom Hardy), and new team architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page).
But once the mission is finally under way, they all soon find out that
the stakes are higher than they thought, and Cobb must also deal with
demons from his past not only tormenting his mind, but threatening to
compromise the operation, and plunge the team into limbo.<br /><br />Nolan has set up a reputation for himself over the years as an
ambitious auteur, and Inception is a masterstroke of storytelling. He
takes a while setting things up, and challenges the audience to keep
up, but the pay off is a thrilling two and a half hours that flies
right by. One terrific sequence worth mentioning is a dazzling hallway
fight sequence where gravity goes haywire, and the film&#x27;s teasing final
short has you itching to revisit after only seconds.<br /><br />Another thing that makes Inception great, is it&#x27;s performances. The
Inception team of DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt, Page, Hardy, Dileep Rao, as
well as &#x22;tourist&#x22; Ken Watanabe, are all wonderful. Marion Cotillard
(who I won&#x27;t go into detail about) is just great, though not quite the
standout. That would be Cillian Murphy, in a subtle, but fantastic
performance.<br /><br />I also want to commend the tech crew who made this movie look, and
sound to the highest level of craftsmanship you can get. The tech crew
includes people who Nolan previously worked with on The Dark Knight
(another great movie), such as DP Wally Pfister, Film editor Lee Smith
(Especially!), Composer Hans Zimmer, Sound designer Richard King, and
respective special &#x26; visual effects supervisors Chris Corbould, and
Paul Franklin. They did their job wonderfully, making inconceivable,
and unbelievable worlds conceivable, and believable.<br /><br />The world of dreams is a complex, but unique thing as your mind creates
the places, while you experience them. It could be of small, or
gargantuan proportions, and Nolan has brilliantly executed this. It was
my most anticipated film of the year, and it fully met (or even
exceeded) my expectations.<br /><br />However, as enthusiastic as I am about this movie, maybe to the point
of too much enthusiasm, I must stress that Inception may not be a movie
for everyone. If you&#x27;re a fan of Nolan&#x27;s previous work, you&#x27;ll really
like this one. If you&#x27;re not, results may vary. It is, like I said, a
very challenging film to fully take in. It&#x27;s a film that demands strict
attention, and could require multiple viewings to fully grasp, and
understand. Never the less, I highly recommend seeing it.<br /><br />Inception is a knockout Summer film that must not be missed. It&#x27;s a
thoroughly compelling, and challenging Sci-Fi, as well as a thoroughly
entertaining, and thrilling heist movie.<br /><br />In my opinion, one of the year&#x27;s best films. I give it a very well
earned **** out of ****
