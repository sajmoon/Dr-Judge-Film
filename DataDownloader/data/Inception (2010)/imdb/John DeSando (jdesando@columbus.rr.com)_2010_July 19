&#x22;You&#x27;re asking me for Inception. I hope you do understand the gravity
of that request.&#x22; Cobb <br /><br />Grave it is: Inception is a dream within a dream and maybe more layers
than that as Memento&#x27;s Christopher Nolan plays this time not just with
time but with the confluence of appearance and reality in a Freudian
world of dream manipulation and regret. Is it also about the
movie-watching experience&#x97;probably.<br /><br />Did I just make any sense? Probably not because I am still working out
the many layers of this most challenging summer sci-fi thriller in
which Com Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is hired to manipulate a corporate
head&#x27;s subconscious through dreams to plant an idea, not Cobb&#x27;s usual
extraction of corporate secrets but this time inception. It&#x27;s espionage
at its most imaginative and confounding but fun in the action and the
struggle to keep up with what is going on.<br /><br />If this sounds all like The Matrix (1999), well, it is difficult to
piece together the different realities like that film, and like
Dreamscape (1984) it depicts dream manipulation. But it is a memorable
film all its own as Cobb struggles in a dream world with his late wife
Mal (Marion Cotillard) that impinges on the world he and Ariadne (Ellen
Page) construct like architects.<br /><br />You got it: Mal means bad, and Ariadne is the Greek mythical guide
through a maze. Nolan is more obviously figurative here than even in
his Dark Knight, which was moody and cerebral enough for an American
comic book hero, Batman.<br /><br />Nolan continues to know how to please an audience visually&#x97;the action
sequences on a variety of terrains devised by Ariadne&#x27;s imagination are
as visceral as the dreams are cerebral. But like Memento, Nolan is
interested in shaking up our control of the order of things: The most
disturbing idea of the film for me was the question of what&#x27;s real and
what&#x27;s appearance, when is death not death, and in what order do dreams
and death come in reality.<br /><br />Although I still don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll return to Inception to find out and
certainly clear out the summer cobwebs, or should that be Cobbwebs?
