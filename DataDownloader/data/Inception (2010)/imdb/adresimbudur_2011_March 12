It is so unnecessary and fairly persuasive; unsuccessfully, insistingly
imposing the audience there is a great mystery going on but weak
fiction just causes a perception of a confusing and boring movie in

action movies because there is no science going on in them. <br /><br />By the way, there&#x27;s no mystery about dreaming, your brain is just
rearranging the randomly recorded data during the day; defragmenting
them according to their relations and deleting the unnecessary ones.
