After a while you think that almost every possible idea has been done.
You see a lot of predictable movies rolling out of the Hollywood movie
factory that are predictable and have already been done. Some of those
movies are enjoyable, others are just outright painful to watch. Still
every once in a while there is that movie that reminds you that there
are still very talented directors and movie writers out there,
Inception is one of those movies! While most movies tackle everyday
troubling things like drug abuse, war, terrorism, power abuse etc
Inception is a movie about dreams and the power they possess. Cobb is
specialized in breaking into peoples dreams. Yes, you read it right! He
breaks into people&#x27;s dreams! Basically it means that he can extract
information from peoples dreams without them ever realising it, they
will think it was just a dream. However Cobb has been put on a special
assignment which is highly unusual. Instead of extracting information
he is asked to actually plant an idea in someone&#x27;s head. However this
is not the first time Cobb has tried to do this and suddenly his
mission turns into a nightmare risking his entire mission and crew. I
can tell you more but i really don&#x27;t want to spoil everything.<br /><br />The way the story is executed really surprised me and is just really
well done! The action is superb and really tense and perfectly goes
from a slow to very fast pace.<br /><br />The acting is just superb! Dicaprio is on top of his game and even
Ellen Paige turns out to be a very good actress as well! There is
really nothing else to say than just: go watch this movie! You will not
regret it!
