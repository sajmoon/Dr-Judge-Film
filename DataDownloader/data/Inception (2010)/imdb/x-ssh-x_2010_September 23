Now THIS is what I like to call summer entertainment! <br /><br />The plot is original and thought provoking. The script is perfect and
cheesy-line free. The acting is spot on (especially from Leonardo
DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who I personally think deserve Oscar
nominations). There is an actual love story that moves you, instead of
mindless sex scenes and unnecessary cleavage/topless shots.<br /><br />This movie really is a breath of fresh air from the normal blockbuster,
that are usually made just to make money and is just 2 hours of flashy
visuals and repetitive and unoriginal &#x22;punch!&#x22; &#x22;kick!&#x22; action.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not saying that Inception doesn&#x27;t have stunning visuals, but they
come in parts and you are so engrossed in the story that you don&#x27;t mind
waiting for the next action scene.<br /><br />All in all, I applaud the director Christopher Nolan for bringing to
life one of the best blockbusters I have ever seen!
