This is truly what film is about. I haven&#x27;t felt so Involved in a movie
in a while, when this movie starts you feel like you are apart of it,
and its over before you know it (this is a 2 and a half hour long
movie).<br /><br />In the beginning it starts out by grabbing your intention very fast,
and after the first scene, i know i felt like my 10 dollars were well
spent. the first half of the movie you meet all of your characters that
you will grow to love and root for. the Exposition is great, you never
feel lost, or frustrated with the film, and you think you would with
such a unusual story.<br /><br />In the second half, the rising action of the movie is so intense for
like an hour and you feel all of the tension in the whole cinema. and i
cannot go to far into the second half with out spoiling things so i
will leave you with this for you to decide to go see it. Once, or if
you are like me twice (in one day).
