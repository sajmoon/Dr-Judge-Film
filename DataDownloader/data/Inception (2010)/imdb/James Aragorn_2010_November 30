What sets inception apart is the randomness of the plot, It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t
follow what we normally call a predictable plot. It&#x27;s like a game with
different levels but each time the player in this case the viewer has
to remember things. Like how deep are we, how much time do we have? On
top of that you have to deal with multiple dimensions and a different
story in each level. If that&#x27;s not enough, the visual aspect of this
movie alone is ridiculous. Anyone who says Inception doesn&#x27;t have much
in the action department is a moron (someone I knew IRL).<br /><br />I watched this in 480p and I regret doing it because as soon as the
movie starts going down some levels you get to see some amazing visual
eye candy, from building recreating itself to some mind blowing
exploding effects. This movie is meant to be watched again and again.<br /><br />Now, majority of viewers (mostly Pakistani I knew) couldn&#x27;t understand
this movie that I can blame on language barrier but mostly their lack
of imagination. Most people aren&#x27;t great with following a story and try
to guess what&#x27;s coming next, since most viewers watch movies in zombie
mode which basically means they just watch it for fun and don&#x27;t really
think about it. You need a certain mindset to absorb or understand
inception on the first go. Granted if you watch the movie (any movie)
second time you notice major things like different dialogues some small
things that you forgot, but most of the time you get the main story
right.<br /><br />Inception sort of mind f**ks you, it tries to hide the main plot and
throws the user in sub plots which completely confuse you if you&#x27;re not
paying attention. So, IMO case I had to use head phones and watch the
whole movie with my mind open. That wasn&#x27;t really necessary because the
movie is very simple. I mean it&#x27;s not like some difficult mystery or
something really hard to grasp. It just has some depth and a dynamic
plot. I blame the viewers for their lack of education or knowledge or
experience.<br /><br />So, all in all Inception is a joy ride which everyone should enjoy if
they just pay some attention. It does have its mind f**k moments but if
you keep things in perspective and only focus on the main story you can
easily see where the movie is going on. And I did enjoy the ending
since it keeps you guessing and you can make different interpretation
of the ending easily.<br /><br />Highly recommended and please: A) Use Headphones B) Watch in 720p or
1080p, anything else is just embarrassing.<br /><br />By totse.info
