I just paraphrased what Roger Ebert, famous film critic, said about the
movie. The ending is definitely a &#x22;WTF&#x22; moment, then you realize that
it couldn&#x27;t have ended better. I can go with the conventional formula
of putting a synopsis of the movie in my review but I think everyone
here has done that already. If you think the movie will leave you as
soon as you exit the theater, then you are wrong. The whole concept
will haunt you, in a good way, and follow you home where you wont be
able to sleep for another few hours. <br /><br />You hear a lot of critique pointing at the film&#x27;s void of emotion but
to my believe the film had adequate emotion formula put in, therefore
if anything more, the movie wouldn&#x27;t be of a sci-fi genre. Actions
scenes are as original as it gets and flows with the story with the
amazing detail it carries with it. Another major attraction is the
visual effects and if you think the folding city was amazing, then you
have seen nothing. I would definitely say the film is complex but not
because it is hard to comprehend but because it leaves for a lot of
open interpretation. <br /><br />If you are still traumatized by the likes of The last Airbendersand
hordes of other sequels this summer, you can redeem your movie
experience with this movie. Go watch it.
