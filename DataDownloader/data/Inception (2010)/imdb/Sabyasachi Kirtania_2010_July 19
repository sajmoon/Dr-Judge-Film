One does get surprised when results overtake expectations but does it
surprise when one meets them over and over again? I guess not.<br /><br />The film is not a surprise coming from Christopher Nolan. I dare say
that after watching all his mainstream movies, but what lies in the
film is way beyond just surprise.<br /><br />Its an integrated package of all and for all..... A rarity nowadays
with animation ruling the silver screen.<br /><br />A notable point among the audience is that they did not come to see a
LEO- flick, its a complete CHRISTOPHER-flick and they were not
disappointed.<br /><br />WORD OF CAUTION: DO NOT blink while watching, you may just miss
something.
