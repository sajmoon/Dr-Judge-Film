There is no doubt that this film is a great movie. But you have to have
an open mind (literally), or your won&#x27;t understand most of it. Very
creative indeed, with an all-too basic story to back it up which is why
it is so interesting.<br /><br />Nothing about this movie is realistic, and there is no other film like
it (save for The Matrix series), so it is really hard to compare with
anything.<br /><br />I honestly don&#x27;t know what to say about this film though. I liked it,
it was good, but I was far more satisfied and entertained watching
Salt. Between my friends and I, Salt garnered far more post-movie
discussion than this. <br /><br />Except for the end - that opinion is up to you! (For me, it was very
predictable - I saw it coming and wasn&#x27;t surprised)
