After viewing this movie, it&#x27;s remained in my head for some time. Quite
simply a stunning movie. I love the mix of different genres. Even
though this is intended to be a sci-fi movie, I sometimes thought I was
watching an action thriller or a drama. Even without the over-use of
special effects we&#x27;re used to, this film blew me away, especially the
rotating corridor scene. Christopher Nolan has proved he is capable of
becoming the next Stanley Kubrick. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a fine
performance as ever, and it&#x27;s refreshing to see him in a sci-fi for a
change. The stellar supporting cast are all superb and do a great job
in the movie. Inception is a tribute to visionary film-making and if it
doesn&#x27;t become as successful as The Dark Knight, it certainly puts
Christopher Nolan on the map as one of the greatest film-makers of all
time.
