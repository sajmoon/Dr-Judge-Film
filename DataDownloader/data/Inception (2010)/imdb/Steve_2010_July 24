I really wasn&#x27;t excited about this one. But I was dragged to it like
many others. When it was finished, my mind wasn&#x27;t warped at all.<br /><br />The acting is just average. Leonardo DiCapiro was great, but every
other actor or actress was a complete nobody, and their characters
literally had no personality.<br /><br />Plot wise, it&#x27;s a complete mess. Here we have a great concept bogged
down by a bad plot. Rather than have something along the lines of
hidden secrets, conspiracies becoming truths, or spies infiltrating
someone&#x27;s mind. Instead it&#x27;s about trying to change a guy&#x27;s mind how he
should run his business. I&#x27;m on the edge of my seat!<br /><br />The main problem was that the dreams were too realistic, which is the
worst possible thing they could&#x27;ve done. If you&#x27;re dreaming the
possibilities are endless. I guess creativity is asking for too much.<br /><br />One thing I don&#x27;t understand about this movie, is the fight scenes. If
it&#x27;s all just a dream, then why are the fights so difficult? They&#x27;re in
a dream, shouldn&#x27;t that give them an advantage to defeat them easily.
The people they fight aren&#x27;t real for crying out loud, and they drag
out these fight scenes on for a long time, trying to make it &#x22;intense&#x22;
and &#x22;explosive.&#x22;<br /><br />There are so many more things I don&#x27;t understand about this movie. <br /><br />Why is it that people&#x27;s subconscious act as a separate being? Isn&#x27;t
supposed to be part of you, not its own individual? <br /><br />Why is Leo&#x27;s wife a homicidal maniac that again seems to be a separate
being yet is supposed to be part of his mind?<br /><br />Last, someone please tell me why bullets can hurt you in dreams?<br /><br />Christopher Nolan does make good movies, but they&#x27;re nothing really
great or amazing. The problem with all his films is that they have
boring beginnings, great middles, and abrupt endings. In the end,
Inception is nothing special. It&#x27;s a great concept held down by bland
characters, generic action scenes, and a boring story. Nolan is the
most overrated director ever.
