Far less original than it thinks it is, this is a very solid action
film that sadly doesn&#x27;t go far enough in its meditations on dream vs.
reality or the ethical implications of mind manipulation, but instead
opts for complex machinations that occasionally dazzle, but often just
confuse, visually and narratively. This is now the third Christopher
Nolan film in a row in which action sequences (not to mention the
labyrinthine plot) are hard to follow due to overly frantic editing and
unclear directing. It appears as though despite his apparent flavor for
it, action is not his strong suit as a director.<br /><br />Much of the film&#x27;s appeal depends upon the premise of mind invasion and
dream manipulation, yet as these ideas are presented here, one gets a
feeling of d&#xE9;ja vu - literally - as many of these conceits have been
played out in many a Star Trek episode, not to mention &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;
etc., often to better effect. Was Nolan afraid of creating a unique
visual style like that film before him because it might become too
similar to what the 1999 SF masterpiece had looked like? Maybe so, but
&#x22;Inception&#x22; suffers from a distinct lack of memorable visuals, aside
from what the trailer already showed. With that veneer of originality
gone, however, the film ultimately tells the tried-and-true story of
the broken hero looking for redemption through a final mission.
DiCaprio does a good enough job in that role, but Marion Cotillard is
the scene-stealer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page show that they
can do more than what they&#x27;re usually booked for.<br /><br />In summary, an entertaining summer flick, but far, far, far from the
groundbreaking experience many moviegoers have made this out to be. And
as such, a huge disappointment as well.
