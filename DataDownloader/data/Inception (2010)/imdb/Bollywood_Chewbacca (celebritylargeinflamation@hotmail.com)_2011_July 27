2011_July 27 
This is the first movie I&#x27;ve seen, which is fitting given the word
&#x22;Inept&#x22; in the title, he he! My friends said it&#x27;s fun to watch movies
but I don&#x27;t really get the point. Like the Nightmare on Elm Street or
the Nightmare Before Christmas, The Darjeeling Limited or Hell in the
Pacific, Inception is another example of Hollywood&#x27;s pseudo-Eastern
process of meta-absorption. Supposedly it&#x27;s supposed to be like a
psychedelic experience, but with things actually happening, but if
someone else made up the story, then how is it going to be a
psychedelic experience for ME? LOL. To be fair, the visual style of the
film did put me in mind of &#x22;certain experiences,&#x22; with the highly
contrasting colors and softly diffused light creating an augmented
reality reminiscent all other CGI movies. However, I stand by my main
point; the feeling was dampened a lot because I knew the story wasn&#x27;t
actually true, and the non-dreamlike images felt less powerful with
someone else&#x27;s unconscious impulses running beneath them. I think
YouTube creates a much more compelling audio/visual experience because
you never know if you&#x27;re going to see something real or not. Also,
there was a lot of really obvious hyperbole in this movie. Kinda
sucked, guys.<br /><br />BTW, wasn&#x27;t this whole bit already done in the Japanese animated
feature PAPRIKA?
