Both Christopher Nolan and James Cameron had a rather lengthy film in
them that was about a decade in the making. The difference between both
is that Nolan focused on ideas and the crafting of a screenplay which
he tries to breath into a comprehensible narrative whereas Cameron
focused on technology and breathes it to life via a recycled a lengthy
version of a childishly simplified story. Personally I&#x27;d take Nolan&#x27;s
story- crafting over Cameron&#x27;s effects any day of the week, but does
that mean Inception works?<br /><br />What is used is a not very complex idea to create a world with its own
rules and a dreamlike quality even though it doesn&#x27;t feel dreamlike.
Then again, dreams don&#x27;t feel very dreamlike either. Everything looks
removed from the real world while at the same time feeling very real.
The crafted world doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re just special effects and
there is a definite feeling of reality to the physically impossible. In
this world unfolds a complex story wherein we explore various themes
such as guilt, illusory happiness and the nature of reality. Although
there is enough food for thought, it is not confusing in any way that
would hurt the story. The story is told very neatly and visually,
without extensive use of talking to explain the plot. Neither does it
needlessly linger. Even with its 148min running time I don&#x27;t think it
took much longer than it needed (and I think most films take longer
than they need to). The actual difficulty of the film would simply lie
in the requirement for you to keep up. But you are rewarded for doing
so. <br /><br />Every time I watch a film I have a slight fear of what I&#x27;m in for.
Sometimes it&#x27;s a reason why I need to see a film a second time to
really appreciate it. Watching a film is like going on a journey where
you are lead through an experience that you are not likely to have in
such an interesting and detached way as at the movies. Too often do I
feel cheated when it all builds up to a form of idiotic propaganda.
With Christopher Nolan, I feel in capable hands. Much like with
Kubrick, I feel that everything is calculated and nourished. He
explores his themes without preaching. Even when there are tendencies
for it, his filmmaking is too removed to show it as anything more than
an opinion. There is a reason for it being removed though.<br /><br />Inception is a rational film above all else. When I say that, I mean
that its beauty lies within the left side of your brain. As the story
was unfolding itself, my emotional bond with the characters was not
what kept me captured. Neither the stakes nor the opposition was ever
truly personal and it wasn&#x27;t the emotional catharsis as much as the
solving of the &#x22;puzzle&#x22; that I was interested in. It&#x27;s a form of
intellectual (but accessible) ride. Even at its most emotional I felt
an interest from an rational distance which I don&#x27;t think was just me.
So, although I should say the characters and their development is not
the strongest feat of Inception I should also add that it&#x27;s not the
reason to watch Inception for. <br /><br />It is rather unique being a big budget film about ideas and Inception
explores them with thoroughness, an ambiguity and a resolution without
making any simplistic statement. It doesn&#x27;t treat its audience like
they&#x27;re a bunch of idiots and is a very rewarding experience for
everyone that takes the trouble to go along for the ride.
