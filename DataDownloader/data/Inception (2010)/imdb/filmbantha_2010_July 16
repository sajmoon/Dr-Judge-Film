Imagine if the brains behind Mensa gathered together one day and
created their own version of the A-Team, it would probably end up being
very similar to Inception. Basically, Cristopher Nolan is a genius;
Inception&#x27;s storyline is an incredible feat of imagination that will
simultaneously amaze and disorientate you with each thrilling turn. The
acting is impeccable, with an ensemble cast that is bound to provoke a
number of Oscar nominations (as long as the Academy realise that at the
core of this science fiction epic there still lies an emotionally
draining thriller ) in dramatic roles that will haunt your dreams for a
long time to come.<br /><br />The less said about the plot the better, not because its bad, in fact
its awe-inspiring to see the lengths Nolan has gone to in order to make
this work , but it would be unfair to spoil your enjoyment of the film
and would be quite a difficult feat to summarise concisely the key
ideas behind Inception. Despite being a complex beast, Inception
remains watchable throughout thanks to the impressive visuals and
mind-blowing special effects that despite being physically impossible
are still incredibly realistic.<br /><br />Its closet comparison would be The Matrix, another game-changing sci-fi
that took special effects to the next level by providing the audience
with one hell of a story and not relying purely on the futuristic
visuals to create the films success. The action definitely has stepped
up a notch in Inception, with events in interweaving dream worlds
affecting the consequences in others. It sounds complicated but it is a
sheer joy to behold as Dicaprio and his team invade people&#x27;s dreams and
simultaneously assault an arctic fortress, defy gravity in an insane
hotel corridor brawl and swerve traffic in a deadly car chase. Anything
is possible in a dream, and thankfully Nolan exploits this to its
maximum potential; trust me on this, the action sequences will leave
you stunned senseless.<br /><br />The only thing that dwarfs the intense action is the labyrinthine plot,
which requires a great deal of concentration to follow. Luckily, Nolan
makes this easy for the viewers by creating a visceral plot that
completely absorbs the audience&#x27;s attention - prompting an almost dream
like state of consciousness as the action unfolds before your very
eyes.<br /><br />As I left the cinema I was undecided on my opinion of the film, there
was just far too much to take in after one viewing. Having said that
though, I would definitely consider catching Inception for a second
time, the more the film has invaded my dreams since watching it, the
more I want to immerse myself in Nolan&#x27;s incredible imagination once
again.
