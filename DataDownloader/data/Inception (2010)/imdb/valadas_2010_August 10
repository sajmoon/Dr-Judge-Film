This movie has got powerful images and sequences some violent and
aggressive some beautiful even poetical. We are from the beginning
caught and dazzled by this net of dreams and counterdreams and
subconscious analysis in an overwhelming whirl of scenes vibrating with
action of body and mind. It&#x27;s indeed a rich film in visual terms with
lots of original and good ideas. In what concerns the story despite the
moving love subplot it also tells us, after watching half of the movie
we begin to think there is little logic in all those entangled dreams
and subdreams and begin even to become somewhat bored.<br /><br />Fortunately after so much confusion the final scenes throw light upon
the whole story erasing the frontier between dream and reality and
giving the story its truthful meaning in an unexpected turn. Go and
watch it very carefully and you will be very surprised in the end.
