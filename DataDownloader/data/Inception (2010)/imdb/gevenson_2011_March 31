Good movie but I couldn&#x27;t get one fundamental problem off my mind. In
the movie their way out of the 3 level dream is a kick, the feeling of
falling that wakes you up sometimes. The chemist says he created a
sedative that will leave the inner ear functioning properly. The inner
ear gives all feeling of motion to you and your brain. Meaning when the
dreamer gets pushed over or falls he will wake up no matter what. Well,
they execute the &#x22;big dream&#x22; or &#x22;job&#x22; on an airplane. The inner ear is
constantly working in an airplane because the airplane is constantly in
motion. Accelerating, decelerating, climbing, descending, turning,
encountering small bumps and turbulence (i.e. fundamental problem).
