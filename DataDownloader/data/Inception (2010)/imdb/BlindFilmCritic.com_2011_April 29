Here&#x27;s a rare treat. An action movie with a great script. Nice going
&#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />So this movie starts out with a bunch of music and the first few lines
of dialog are in a foreign language and I&#x27;m going, &#x22;Terrific. Is this
dream movie going to turn into nightmare?&#x22; Ha ha.<br /><br />There were parts of this movie, I&#x27;m telling you, I had not a clue as to
what was going on. But, here&#x27;s the thing, I think sighted people had
the same problem. You just have to wait and it all gets explained for
you. It&#x27;s okay sighted people. I know, I know. Ssshhhh. Ssshhhh. I got
you. Ha ha.<br /><br />The thing I like about a movie like this is you not only have to invent
yourself into a situation but you also have to invent the way out. And
that&#x27;s a very cool trick to be able to do.<br /><br />The atmosphere they created in the movie was incredible. A nice slow
burn with the character development of the story arc and everything.
How about Leonard o DiCaprio, huh. The cool thing is he&#x27;s got a very
human element to him in this film. He&#x27;s just not one of these steely
cold agents who can walk around and handle a gun. He&#x27;s very much a
human in this film too. It&#x27;s great.<br /><br />The music in the movie is incredible. Hans Zimmer who is one of my
favorites is just amazing. What an atmosphere the music creates in this
film. It really helps with the tension.<br /><br />So it&#x27;s an action movie, right? You know how these things are. There
are these long passages where there is plenty of stuff going on but
with no picture - all you hear is gun fire, screaming, a car chase, a
little bit of grunting, some other human noises. But it doesn&#x27;t matter&#x85;
because the way this movie is written they tell you after the scene
what all the action was and explain it to you one more time. Nice job,
Christopher Nolan. Seriously. Come on! You can do movies for me
anytime. Ha ha.<br /><br />More at BlindFilmCritic.com
