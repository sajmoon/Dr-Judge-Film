When first hearing of Inception and it&#x27;s intriguing plot, I was
automatically interested. Eventually, that interest transformed into an
irresistible urge to watch it. When I did view this movie, I was amazed
at the complexity of the story line (although before watching it I
figured it would be) and the exceptional amount of thought put into
this movie. <br /><br />When watching this movie I saw immediately realized the depth and
complexity of Inception, which most people fail to recognize in such a
movie. In my humble opinion, this is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s greatest
achievement, although, to grasp the deepest complexities and concepts
it is imperative that you heed close attention throughout the entire
duration of the movie; failure to do such will result in confusion and
or watching the movie again to actually grasp it (as required for many
of my own friends). <br /><br />To any individual with an above average intellect, I highly recommend
this movie to you, any other individuals, stick with the Disney movies.
