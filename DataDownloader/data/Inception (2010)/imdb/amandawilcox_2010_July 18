It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve seen a movie that makes you think. I
mean really think. I love movies that do that. Inception is the perfect
combination of action, suspense, plot, thrill, and it makes you think.
You&#x27;re not just watching some meaningless plot. You get deeper down the
rabbit hole as the movie goes on. Even when the movie is over you still
are left falling.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to put any spoilers in here, I suggest that you see this
movie yourself. Christopher Nolan is brilliant! If he doesn&#x27;t get an
Oscar nod for at least best original screenplay I will be so mad!<br /><br />I will say something for Leonard DiCaprio&#x27;s acting, I think that it has
gotten a lot better as time has gone on. I don&#x27;t know if this movie
makes him Oscar worthy but it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if he was nominated.
