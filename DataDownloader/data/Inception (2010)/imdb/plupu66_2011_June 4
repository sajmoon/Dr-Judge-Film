Based on reviews I was hoping this was a &#x22;different&#x22; American film in
the sense that it will have substance, subtlety and that it will make
me think. It did not, it did not and it did not again. It is your
typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions,
fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell
tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars -
instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely
astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does
not make a lot of sense either. It reminded me of the
teachers/professors who were confusing on purpose in order to make us
believe they are smarter than we were.
