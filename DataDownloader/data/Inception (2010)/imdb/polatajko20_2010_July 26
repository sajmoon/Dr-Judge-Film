Just when i thought concepts such as the matrix couldn&#x27;t be improved
on, this does it! It is fresh, innovative and exciting from start to
finish.<br /><br />While it is quite a long movie it never feels like it (a sign of a good
movie me thinks!)It does need a lot of concentration in order to follow
everything that is going on, and similar to the matrix, the more times
you watch it, the more you understand it. There are many layers to this
movie, both characters and storyline and the director does well to
answer questions that the audience have as the story develops. How/what
would happen or that happen within a dream. Or why cant a person in
someone else&#x27;s dreams not just do this and that. All solutions/answers
are well explained and make lots of sense! The effects are fantastic
and it was amazing to see in the cinema. I no doubt think that we could
have several sequels or prequels to this movie as there are enough
directions it could go in.<br /><br />Di Caprio is amazing in this movie and deserves an Oscar for his
flawless performance.
