I thought this was suppose to be a great movie? I am not about to sit
around for longer than 45 minutes jumping from scene to scene trying to
decipher what the hell the movie is about - when a movie should be
telling me the story. This was awful. How is the world does this movie
have a high rating? Who is rating this film. We turned this movie OFF
after 45 Minutes for a reason - it was that bad. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY
OR YOUR TIME! If people on these websites don&#x27;t start voting
realistically the movie industry will think this is what you like to
see - and will keep making these crap movies. Just because a high
profile actor is in the film does not warrant it to be spectacular.
This is the second crap film from Leo in a row.
