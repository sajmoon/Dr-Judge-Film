Inception is truly an unforgettable movie experience. I think the
Academy does not like Christopher Nolan, because he hasn&#x27;t been even
nominated for Best Director. Honestly, i think this movie should have
been the big winner of the Oscars, but that is just my personal
opinion. If not, it would have truly deserved the award for Best
Screenplay &#x26; Best Score.<br /><br />Inception can be sorted similar as the Matrix. It is one of those
movies with a brilliant story that makes you think about yourself, the
world and the existence of humanity, while it is also technically
incredible. But first, the screenplay: it is simply remarkable and one
of the best ever. A very intelligent plot, logical storyline,
unexpected ending twist and also one of the best, most non-Hollywood
and innovative ending scenes ever.<br /><br />There are also things in the movie, that deserved and have actually won
an Oscar: cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual
effects. These four things are also amazing. A giant cliff falling into
the sea, the streets of Paris bending itself, spectacular shootout at a
what seems as an abandoned army base... All these scenes are great to
look at, so Inception has both a brilliant screenplay and brilliant
technical things.<br /><br />But there is another thing, that was also overlooked by the Academy:
the score. A monumental Hans Zimmer soundtrack is an unforgettable
piece of music, from the destructive Dream is collapsing, the
energy-inducing Mombasa to the emotional masterpiece Time, Inception&#x27;s
soundtrack would have probably won an Oscar, if Hans Zimmer woudn&#x27;t
already had one in his collection.<br /><br />Combining all of these elements, there is nothing less then a perfect
whole. And that is exactly what Inception is.
