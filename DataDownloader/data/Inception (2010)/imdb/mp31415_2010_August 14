Well, it&#x27;s of course not 1 out of 10, more like 4, but in the light of
current rating 9 out of 10 and climbing I&#x27;d give it a negative number.
Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it&#x27;s becoming more and
more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting
and some scenes are original but that&#x27;s pretty much it. Each and every
character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such
a clich&#xE9; and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and
unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in
cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is
an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just
skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such
movies there is feeling that it&#x27;s made like a puzzle from predefined
pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does
not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a
movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas
to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre
result, let&#x27;s wish him next time to make less primitive and more
interesting show.
