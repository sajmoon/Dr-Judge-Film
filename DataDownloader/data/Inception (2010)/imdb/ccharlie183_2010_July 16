This movie is spectacular in almost every way. From the bazaar dark
city like special effects(only much better) to a perfectly thought out
non-linear style somewhat reminiscent of memento this movie just all
fits together impeccably. The acting is convincing and there are many
familiar faces from previous &#x22;Nolan&#x22; films also many new ones. This
film may be to difficult for some to follow if they don&#x27;t pay attention
or if they are unintelligent if thats the case u could always go see it
again but it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary for most people, I hope. The movie
has a very polished look to it throughout and it seems to draw from
many different influences such as Dark city, COD:MW 2, The Matrix,
Lost, its a satisfying film in the end and it leaves u thinking and
with a sense of uncertainty. this movie is a must watch for any fan of
mystery, sci-fi, drama, and action.
