While this big-budget, science-infused action movie might attract all
types of people, it is, upon watching it, a very intellectual movie
(even if the trailers make it appear otherwise.) I walked into the
theater expecting an average, generic film; however, I received, not
only a good film, but the best of 2010, and among the best films of all
time( and definitely the best of Dicaprio&#x27;s catalog of classics.) <br /><br />While the incredibly intricate &#x22;dream invasion&#x22; idea was not only
confusing, but a bit too complicated for most viewers used to a simple
plot, it was so beautifully executed and satisfying to those who
understood.<br /><br />So, all in all, here is the ranking: Action-9/10 (sweet action
sequences in anti-gravity) Smarts-10/10 (truly intellectually charged)
Plot-9/10 (Great plot with almost no holes) Effects-10/10(beautifully
done, very real)<br /><br />So, all in all, Inception will confuse some, and enchant others. It is
one of my new favorites. I give it an overall 9.6/10
