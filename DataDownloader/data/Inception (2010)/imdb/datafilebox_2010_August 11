This movie is very good. but it is not the 3rd best movie of all time.
i&#x27;m sorry. IMDb please check your system on how ratings are calculated.
reviewers are biased towards Christopher Nolan. i watched the movie
based on 1 preview i saw, without knowing who the director was. most of
the reviews were about the director, and he was not acting in the
movie. come on people stop it, review the movie and not the director.<br /><br />upon my research i realized that this is the director that does great
movies. he directed dark knight which was good but not deserving of the
#11 spot it currently holds. <br /><br />i have great respect for people who put a lot of effort in their work.
the director seems to be the type of person who may be the best in his
class, and so i write this review and clearly state that my aim is not
to take the glory that Mr. Nolan deserves. this movie was the best for
the year so far, MY ONLY PROBLEM: is with it being the 3rd best of all
time.<br /><br />the only reason i gave it a 8 was that there was no 7.5 button to press
so i rounded up. i watch 52 movies every year, and have a desire to
make movies myself, but in my heart of hearts this movie is not the 3rd
best. it is nowhere near my top 10, not even close. people please stop
giving biased reviews.<br /><br />Bees
