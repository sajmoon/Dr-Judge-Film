Devin Faraci of CHUD.com claimed that &#x22;Inception&#x22; was everything
director Christopher Nolan had been building up to in his film-making
career. I disagree; this was everything he has been building to with
his film-watching career. That&#x27;s not a knock, either.<br /><br />Nolan is cutting himself short in interviews when he says he was
influenced by &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, but maybe he&#x27;s using that to address the
mainstream audience, since that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll likely accuse him of
stealing from. However, the rest of us know better (especially since
&#x22;The Matrix itself owes its genesis to many other films before it, as
most great films do.) Despite being, at it&#x27;s most basic, a high-concept
heist film, it doesn&#x27;t rely on, nor does it emphasize its set piece(s),
the big robbery, or in this case, the big. . . placement?<br /><br />Instead, this film pays off through the emotions of the characters,
which is awesome because it makes the set pieces seem like small, but
visually stunning discoveries. Like David Fincher&#x27;s &#x22;The Game&#x22;, the
movie makes effort to remind you that, as grand as the action and
adventure can and will become, this all still happens in the heads of
&#x22;real&#x22; people, all dealing with their own issues which, interestingly
enough, can effect the adventure in ways that could help or hurt their
goal. If I can find one fault in this, I wish they concentrated on more
than just the lead, DiCaprio&#x27;s, character when it came to emotions
because he&#x27;s honestly washed out in that department, and for good
reason. When his tragic past is revealed, it is easily the most
effective piece of the puzzle thanks in no small part to Marion
Coutilard, whom I&#x27;ve never even heard speak English until this film.
But too bad the film had to wear that piece out until it barely fit.<br /><br />You see, as a high concept film, the set-up requires heavy, HEAVY
exposition. It takes up the majority of the first hour and, although I
didn&#x27;t feel it, I saw people walking out of the theater by the mid-
point. Even the aforementioned emotional piece is delivered in
exposition. This would&#x27;ve been fine since you have to know the game
before you play, but the exposition extends into the third act when
DiCaprio&#x27;s character has to face his demons, and goes on to the point
of repeating a flashback from before which was unnecessary. This is the
problem when one character gets all of the emotional development.<br /><br />This leads me up to my main strike against this film: it shouldn&#x27;t have
been a film. Not that this gratuitous level of &#x22;tell, don&#x27;t show&#x22; would
be more acceptable in another medium, but it, like all of Nolan&#x27;s
stories, would be easier to digest in comic form. This way, you get the
genius of Nolan&#x27;s visuals and are able to turn back the pages to review
pieces you may have overlooked instead of restarting the whole damn
film. Going back to what I said about the non-emphasis on set pieces, I
don&#x27;t expect viewers to sludge through the explanation during a second
viewing just to get to the toned down but entertaining action. It&#x27;s not
enough, for me at least because it&#x27;s hard for me to rewatch a film a
re- experience the same emotional jolt as the first time, which saddens
me because their is some superb film-making that I&#x27;d like to re-explore
just for learning&#x27;s sake.<br /><br />So, overall, see it. Support original (yes, despite the influences)
material from great directors. I don&#x27;t want to see Nolan reduced to
superhero franchise films, regardless of how good they&#x27;ve been. The
next Batman/Superman film will inevitably be made (or rebooted) with or
without Nolan, so it&#x27;s incredibly important that he gets a chance to
stretch his legs and make something more individual and, ultimately,
most resonant. And who knows, maybe with those future successes, he can
do a franchise you enjoy right instead of, I don&#x27;t know, M. Night
Shyamalan.
