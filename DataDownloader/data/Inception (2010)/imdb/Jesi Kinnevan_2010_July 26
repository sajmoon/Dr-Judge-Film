Let me start by saying that I thought Inception was an amazing concept,
highly creative, and visually stunning.<br /><br />I found the dialog, however, to be too shallow, literal, and
over-saturated with exposition to drive the plot. There was no subtext
to anything anyone said, very little character development of anyone
but Leo&#x27;s character, and I found myself not really caring about any of
them more than I would a stranger in a tough situation. I&#x27;ve heard
people say that Nolan is the new Kubrick. I would have to agree if I
were judging him based on Inception alone. His combination of
great-concept-little-character-development does mirror 2001: A Space
Odyssey, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove, where all the main
characters are just out of reach.<br /><br />But looking at Nolan&#x27;s past works like Memento and The Dark Knight, I
wouldn&#x27;t say the same thing, as the relationship dynamics in these two
films were rich with layers and subtext. He also had other writers
helping him with these films, whereas he was the sole writer on
Inception. Maybe he shouldn&#x27;t be flying solo as a writer yet. Amazing
director, creative thinker, needs to work on creating more
sophisticated dialog and developing interesting varied characters
through character-defining decisions and how their decisions
reflect/don&#x27;t reflect their words. One character making one big
decision at the end isn&#x27;t enough to make up for 2 hours of shallow
dialog.
