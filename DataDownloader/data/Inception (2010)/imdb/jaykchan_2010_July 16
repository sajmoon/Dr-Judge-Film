Snapshot: &#x22;Inception&#x22; has an incredible story that has been told very
well. The plot is very complex and anyone who claims to have fully
understood the movie in one time is simply lying or is probably from
Pluto. Inception will give you everything you can think of including
sic-fi, action, thriller, some chemistry and the occasional laugh.<br /><br />Highlights of Plot: What most people know is that movie is about
entering another persons dream and stealing ideas, but the way they&#x27;ve
executed this concept is simply phenomenal. It will take a while before
you start to figure out what exactly is going on in the movie, but once
you understand the plot, you will get glued. There are a few minor
issues with the plot, but you will probably not notice them while
watching the movie. The movie has a good pace and some really good
action scenes.<br /><br />What&#x27;s good: The acting is really good, the entire cast does justice to
their roles. The action scenes are phenomenal. The screenplay is mind
bending and the story is something that most people wouldn&#x27;t have
anticipated, very different.&#xA0;Of course the direction is top notch. <br /><br />What&#x27;s bad: It takes a while before the movie gains momentum. It&#x27;s a
real head- scratcher and it will make you think, so some people might
not like that.<br /><br />Who should watch it: Any Christopher Nolan fan. Anyone who wants a mind
bending story with great suspense and action.&#xA0;<br /><br />Who should avoid it: Anyone who wants a simple plot and expects a
watch-enjoy-forget type movie. Anyone who does not tolerate minor plot
holes.<br /><br />Summary: I would rate this as one of my favorite movies, it&#x27;s a real
masterpiece and I would surely recommend everyone to watch it! In fact
I will watch this again very soon! &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<br /><br />&#xA0; &#xA0;
