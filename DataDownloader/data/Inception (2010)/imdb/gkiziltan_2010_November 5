I have already wasted too much time of my time for watching this movie.
So I&#x27;ll be brief...<br /><br />If you really think that this is a work of a genius or you are a very
smart person because you have understood what this move is about, then
I suggest you kill yourself and wake up to reality. This one is nothing
more than an average action movie with ideas and scenes taken from
other really good movies.<br /><br />Inception is ranked number 3 in IMDb right now and it is the most
overrated movie ever in history. Normally, I would rate it with a 5 or
6 but its IMDb rating (9.1 at the moment) should go down to where it
belongs to.
