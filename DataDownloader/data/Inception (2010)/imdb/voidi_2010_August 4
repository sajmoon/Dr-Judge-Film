Everything important has already been said, so I&#x27;ll be brief. This is
the most amazing movie I&#x27;ve seen in a long, long time. Normally, I
dislike watching good movies in the cinema, since the dub is never
quite as good as the original audio, but even that couldn&#x27;t throw me
off this time. When the credits were rolling, I was sitting there for
about 5 minutes, speechless, because it had been so much better than my
already high expectations. There is brilliance in every aspect: action,
suspense, effects, coolness, soundtrack, intelligence, controversy,
dialogs, emotional conflicts, and all this packed in an incredibly
complex and challenging story.<br /><br />This is my new favorite movie of all time, and I have a huge amount of
respect for Mr. Nolan for writing this script AND directing the movie
so perfectly.<br /><br />Do not miss this one.
