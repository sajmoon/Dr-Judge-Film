I cannot believe I waited so long to watch this film. I convinced
myself it&#x27;d be another long and confusing movie which I&#x27;d leave for a
while until I have the mental strength to watch it, now I regret not
even watching this in the Cinema.<br /><br />An exceptional masterpiece, Caprio performs amazingly as does the whole
cast. Some parts did confuse me, but that is how complex the plot is,
complex enough to involve you, but still at the end of the movie you
understand everything.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough, it also keeps a huge grin on your
face near the end, plus tears of joy. It keeps you perplexed, involved,
on edge, and most importantly it never strays from the main plot.<br /><br />Watch this before you watch ANYTHING else.<br /><br />10/10, amazing.
