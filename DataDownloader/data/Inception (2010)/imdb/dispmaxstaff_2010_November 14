I felt like I&#x27;m wasting my time with this movie, really. All of its
plot is based on very simple idea, yet this simple idea fails to
convince me that it&#x27;s somehow possible in real world or necessary for
heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or
relay the message. Come on, I was on the edge of my seat when I was
watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never
disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was! With
Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode 10050.
The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry
if they deliver the thought to the poor sob&#x27;s head which they drugged
on the plane. I simply don&#x27;t care if they succeed or not. No immersion.
In general words, special effects were good, street/bridge bending
animations were good, yet I was bored the whole time. 6 out of 10 for
this pointless flick which I forget in few weeks.
