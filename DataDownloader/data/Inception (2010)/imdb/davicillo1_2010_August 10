2010_August 10 
I&#x27;m a demanding cinema viewer and I don&#x27;t like at all the crappy movies
that Hollywood is producing lately.<br /><br />So, I was truly amazing to see (at last!) an amazing work of art. This
movie has almost everything: action (realistic), fantasy, good
characters, excellent plot, very good special effects, humour,
psichology, and emotions without being cheesy at all! I don&#x27;t want to
give any detail of it, as other people is saying, the less you know,
better for you to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />I also appreciate that Hollywood has abandoned (for once) the
crappyfilmaking, returning to the way that made Hollywood great in the
past.<br /><br />I give it a 10, and I&#x27;m 37 years old that wants good plot and
characters, not just a teenager eager for plain action (I apologize to
the teenagers, but it&#x27;s usually true! ;-) Best regards and see this
movie, it will not disappoint you!. David.
