This year Christopher Nolan offered a package of crime and thrill to
the audience in the form of the movie &#x27;Inception&#x27;. I awaited this movie
for a long time and after watching the film in theater i was not fully
satisfied. yes, after watching &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; in the year 2008 my
expectations were very high. Yes &#x27;The Dark knight&#x27; was a class act but
you cannot anticipate the same from Inception.<br /><br />It is noteworthy that reaching onto a two-way judgment at the end of
the film doesn&#x27;t make it an exceptional one. Christopher Nolan also
tried the same idea in his 2006 project &#x27;The Prestige&#x27;, with Inception
the only difference is that here the plot is different.<br /><br />If we talk about the star cast of this film then Leonardo was
impressive. Besides him, i liked the work of Ellen Page pretty well.
Yes, she is beautiful and talented and have a lots of scope in the
upcoming years. One thing i disliked the most was the role of Michael
Caine. In the entire film only two or three scenes were allotted to
him. He was also involved in Nolan&#x27;s previous projects but with better
roles. Michael Caine is a very good actor. I can&#x27;t understand why Nolan
tried to keep him in the movie if there was no relevant scope for him.<br /><br />while concluding my review i only want to say that i am a good fan of
Christopher Nolan films but i don&#x27;t want to recommend Inception
wholeheartedly. Watch it only if you are a good fan of crime mystery
thrillers. If you really want to see the best works of Nolan then you
can go for Memento (2000) and the two films of Batman series.<br /><br />And of course, INCEPTION DOESN&#x27;T DESERVE TO BE AT LEAST ON THE TOP 10
LIST OF IMDb.<br /><br />Regards....
