A masterpiece in all ways.<br /><br />Inception stuns and entrances - an architecture of sublime grandeur. It
seduces the mind and the imagination and we breathe in the wonder and
create it&#x27;s world as we go deeper...deeper...into the dream.<br /><br />And the turns, the sensations of freefall, as the story moves...as the
idea roots in...<br /><br />Imagery that is deeply surreal, but demanding of our full belief and
investment. A maze we walk and stumble and fall through toward the
center, toward the crux, the spiral end...<br /><br />And when it&#x27;s over, when we get that final kick, one wonders where was
reality and where was...the inception.
