I voted this 1 out of 10, (not because it deserves it, it&#x27;s probably a
4 or 5 to be fair), but because I wanted to protest at this rising to
number 3 in the top 250 of all time. YOU MUST BE JOKING, RIGHT? This is
a better film than Pulp Fiction? The usual suspects? The good, the bad
and the ugly? One flew over the cuckoo&#x27;s nest? Bladerunner? Have these
people even seen those films? Do they honestly place these films below
this Emperor&#x27;s new clothes? Character development? Virtually nil.
Suspense? Not much. Plot, OK, but I really didn&#x27;t care about most of
these people at the end. Visually interesting in parts, at least! I
won&#x27;t be buying this on DVD - one viewing was more than enough for me!
See it by all means, but, DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!
