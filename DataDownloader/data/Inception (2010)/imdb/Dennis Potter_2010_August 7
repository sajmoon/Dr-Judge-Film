I&#x27;ve heard the word visionary thrown Nolan&#x27;s way, but this film was the
work of a rather sterile imagination. Yes, it had a few layers of
narrative cleverly interweaved with each other, but there was little to
compel me at its core. The root cause of Cobb&#x27;s state of mind just
didn&#x27;t grab me - partly as this relationship was never given the chance
to develop to a tangible level. The elements of subconscious displayed
were dull and the approach to the dreamworld rather banal - focusing as
it did mainly on bland designs, bendy gimmicks and exploding things.
There was little edge to Nolan&#x27;s vision, he seemed quite happy to drown
us in relentless exposition and unimaginative slow-mo shots. Scenes
were very quick and at no point approached the atmosphere and intrigue
of a real dream. A shame, because at their best, this is what films can
do - engineer the quality of a waking dream. Compare Inception to the
more intriguing work of Lynch, where scenes seduce with the perfect
balance of the real and surreal, and whose images and ideas tend to
linger in the mind. On top of this, Nolan is simply not a very good
director of action; he is quite loose with the camera, and I yearned
for more flair and invention in these scenes. Instead, he relied on an
incredibly insistent score to give the action some punch. <br /><br />For a film about dreams and the subconscious, it was curiously
impersonal and mechanical. Certainly, the real danger and sexuality of
the subconscious might scare off mainstream audiences, but Nolan was
given free reign to do what he wanted - so why not do something more
interesting? The film is less concerned with psychology and more with
the narrative possibilities afforded by a convoluted dreamworld
fiction. Perhaps Nolan does dream of corporate worlds and Bond
fortresses. Unfortunately, such things don&#x27;t interest me.
