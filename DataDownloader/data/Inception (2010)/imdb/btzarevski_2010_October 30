My goodness me is this a fantastically terrific movie!! I watched this
movie in August and here I am now in November and I am still in awe of
it! Christopher Nolan has delivered yet anther mesmerizing masterpiece
and while I can write pages and pages of it, I realize this is a
complex movie with many long reviews so I will try and keep this
short...ish.<br /><br />Inception tells the the story of Cobb (DiCaprio) who along with his
team builds dreams. They then place their subject into that dream and
allow them to &#x22;fill it with their secrets&#x22;. That&#x27;s about as simply as I
can explain it because you can imagine that once that dream is filled,
the manipulation Cobb can do is endless. Cobb gets enlisted to perform
&#x27;inception&#x27; on a high profile figure i.e: place an idea into the
subject through placing them in a dream you created for them. The movie
basically follows the protagonists in their mission all the while
showing Cobb try to deal with the trauma in his life. That&#x27;s all say
about the storyline as I don&#x27;t want to give too much away.<br /><br />The positive points for this movie are endless. Firstly, the acting!
Leonardo DiCaprio has matured into IMO the finest actor of his
generation and his performance in Inception is truly outstanding,
riveting, emotional, deep and definitely for me deserves the Best Actor
Oscar! The rest of the cast pull in equally terrific performances which
makes this one of the best acted films I have seen (and I have watched
all the legends at their peak!). Secondly, the effects are
jaw-dropping. Forget the Matrix &#x22;rip-offs&#x22; and what other nonsense the
few negative reviews claim; the effects will leave you spellbound and
completely make this movie a masterpiece. Thirdly, Hans Zimmer pulls in
with a terrific score which captures the feel of the movie incredibly
well and masterfully aids in building emotion where needed. Fourthly,
the storyline is absolutely original and perfectly woven and told! Make
no mistake, this is a complex movie with complex themes but with a fair
bit of concentration, you will absolutely love it! I could go on and
on...and so I shall; fifthly, the ending is utterly brilliant and will
leave you reeling and thinking long after this movie ends (as it did
with me!).<br /><br />I have long waited for a movie of such high caliber and this blew my
expectations right out the door and set new ones at a stratospheric
level! If this movie does not get Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best
Director and Best Actor in the next Oscars, I will completely denounce
the Oscars as a hoax! This movie is still playing in some theaters so I
beg you, do yourself a favor and go see this; a movie which will
definitely live to earn legendary status. All the hype is in fact
underrated and you will not be disappointed no matter how high your
expectations are! If there was a score of more than 10/10, I would give
it. My only wish is that Nolan never stops making movies!<br /><br />P.S. If you want to see a really good trailer of it, check out
