What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created
something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which
will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the
movie, directed by Hollywood&#x27;s most inventive dreamers, was shown in
London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored
maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it
deserve all this?<br /><br />Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of
various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs
forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he&#x27;s increasingly
haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has
a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on
his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he
had lost his love!<br /><br />But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken
Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his
business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his
job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: &#x27;Inception&#x27;<br /><br />Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out
the the task, Cobb&#x27;s &#x27;brainiac&#x27; specialists team up again with him,
Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy
(Eames), a &#x22;forger&#x22; who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao),
a powerful sedative supplier. <br /><br />There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs
and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don&#x27;t just watch
the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride.
The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is
electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will
get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.<br /><br />Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in
Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered
forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will
be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an
extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work
is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in
the &#x27;Best Director&#x27; category. If &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a metaphysical puzzle,
it&#x27;s also a metaphorical one: It&#x27;s hard not to draw connections between
Cobb&#x27;s dream-weaving and Nolan&#x27;s film making, intended to seduce us,
mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.<br /><br />To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a
favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by
Nolan! <br /><br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />Thanks &#x26; Regards
