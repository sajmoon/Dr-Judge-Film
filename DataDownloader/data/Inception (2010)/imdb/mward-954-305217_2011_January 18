Visually stunning. Incredibly imaginable.<br /><br />Exceptionally written screen play from the story to the dialogue. <br /><br />Tremendous editing, and cinematography, with a Hanz Zimmer score (nuff
said).<br /><br />Chris Nolan is probably my favorite director of this generation. The
depth of his screen plays make other movies difficult to watch.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen it, wait are you waiting for?<br /><br />If you read books.. try this, it has visuals that will compete with the
best you have imagined while reading.<br /><br />A rare treat for your mind.
