When it comes to a movie like Inception, it is very difficult to see
reviews about it without being taken in by the hype. I urge you to not
go into the theater expecting the most mind-blowing experience as I
did. Although it did in fact deliver, easily, the most complex and
intricate plot I have seen in a long time, it was not as exciting as I
thought it would be. I applaud Nolan for developing such a wonderful
script and storyline and appreciate the visual effects tremendously,
however, it is important to also focus on the characters in a film,
which with the exception of one character, felt rather distant through
the entire movie. The acting was not the caliber that the movie
deserved but it did bring several actors back to the spotlight and
showed a great performance from Ellen Page. This movie is perfect for
anyone that enjoyed The Godfather as it requires close attention to
detail that ultimately leads to an excellent finale.
