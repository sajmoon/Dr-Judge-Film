I wanna make this short, because I know I don&#x27;t like to read long
reviews. The movie is absolutely fantastic, even thou it lasts for more
than 2 hours, it&#x27;s magical and unpredictable. The actors are
phenomenal, so are the special effects who are beyond good. At one
point I got a little confused and I couldn&#x27;t really catch up, but after
a while I realized what&#x27;s up. The +2 hours passed by very quickly
(which is kinda ironic) and I could see that the rest of the audience
were also mesmerized by the film. A very original plot which is very
rare nowadays, and a team of superb actors who leave nothing to chance.
You MUST watch this movie if you&#x27;re a true movie lover. No more words,
just go to the nearest cinema.
