As a fiction writer, I very much enjoy creating stories, worlds, and
trying to keep everything tied together. IT&#x27;s a great challenge.
Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation. His movies are
groundbreaking, and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal
creations.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes were tough to figure out, but later you understand
how those scenes were relevant to the story, and the rest of it really
wasn&#x27;t that hard for me - it made sense. The score was fantastic - I
noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole
time, rather than in key moments. It adds to the drama - I like it.<br /><br />The acting was very strong. Leo is a talented actor and did his thing
in this movie. The rest of the cast was strong also, but I don&#x27;t know
if any of them will win major awards - except maybe the ex-wife. She
was great. Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in
there - that was interesting.<br /><br />One flaw I could pick on was that it wasn&#x27;t clear what anyone else&#x27;s
motivation was to finish the Inception job. Clearly Leo&#x27;s character had
a goal, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell why the others were so loyal and
accommodating. Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered? The reality
bend in Inception was done to perfection. Rang very similar to Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regard.<br /><br />The movie was gorgeous to look at. The style was similar to his other
recent films - and that&#x27;s a very good thing.<br /><br />And the ending. What can I say, it was one of the most satisfying
endings I&#x27;ve ever seen. I walked out and just nodded my head. Yep. Very
nice. Extraordinarily well done film.
