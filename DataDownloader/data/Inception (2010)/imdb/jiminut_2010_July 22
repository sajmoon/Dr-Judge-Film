This was the first movie in years that had strangers buzzing about what
we all saw in the men&#x27;s room after it ended. That leads me to conclude
that the film, while not short at around 150 minutes, was compelling
enough that nobody took a break during the viewing. There&#x27;s was a lot
to talk about on the drive home, and I see the IMDb board is buzzing
with speculation on what happened, particularly the ending. You could
probably watch Inception half a dozen times sussing out the fictional
technology that was at its heart, the hidden meanings in some of the
dialog, the multiple layers upon layers in which the plot took place. <br /><br />My take was less concerned with the details. I went into this viewing
expecting an inspired film experience created by a modern master. And I
wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I found the cinematography on par with (and no
doubt inspired by) Hitchcock&#x27;s classics like North by Northwest and
Vertigo. It should win an Oscar in that category. The score was
fantastic. The actors were clearly enjoying themselves. This was a
summer Hollywood blockbuster of the finest quality.
