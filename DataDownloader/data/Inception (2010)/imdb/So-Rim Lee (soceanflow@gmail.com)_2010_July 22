Inception: The Nightmare Labyrinth, A Film Review July 2010, So-Rim Lee<br /><br />Three hours pass by in a wrinkle of time when a film is visually rich,
fast-paced, blended well with arresting music, and, most of all,
presents a meticulously structured montage that keeps the storyline
intact within omnibus subplots and syncopates the general unnecessary.
After seven years of writing and another three in the making,
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception turns out to be a well-built labyrinth
that takes the audience through different levels of the &#x22;subconscious&#x22;
represented by action-packed worlds of dreams. Since its opening, the
film has received a variety of mixed reviews and a good load of
possible assumptions and reader-response theories regarding its rather
deceitful ending. The film is open to many interpretations, as its tag
line boasts, &#x22;Ideas define a person and his world.&#x22; The audience&#x27;s
demand for a definitive, if not entirely positive, ending, has indeed
made possible so many ideas about &#x22;what really happened&#x22; that continue
to live and haunt so many minds after the movie ends and the real world
reels back.<br /><br />Inception does not call for an elaborate, scientific decoding of its
seeming mystery; the previsioning part had already been finished by
Nolan himself, and, as much as the film seems to scream out for an
all-prevailing interpretation, the audience should always be reminded
that the primary role of cinema is to deceive, lure, and therefore, to
entertain, not to plant philosophical meanderings and other mind-games
that far exceeds what it originally offers. In the end, every film is
an inception as the film defines the term, or rather, Dom Cobb defines
the term. Through two-thirds of the film, a keen viewer should realize
that everything that happens on the reel happens from Cobb&#x27;s
perspective, insight, mind and thought. It is Cobb that takes the crew
into the world of dreams, into dreams within dreams, and into the
&#x22;limbo&#x22; which, in the strictest sense, is only his generic creation in
itself. If the cinema could manipulate the audience within its given
time, in this case which is three hours, Inception uses it admirably
well; even after the movie ends the audience stumbles back into reality
with lingering thoughts that question how the end is the beginning is
the end.<br /><br />All in all, the role of women in the film calls for attention. Ariadne
is the designer and the weaver of the labyrinthine dreams the crew risk
their lives to jump in for action, in the middle of whose labyrinth is
the Minotaur, Mal Cobb. Ariadne, whose identity is hardly revealed
throughout the entire journey, is the architect of an infrastructure
that proves to be out of her control, as it is ruled by the ghost of a
much more feminine identity: Mal Cobb. The fundamental question rolls
into the picture; does the weaver come first, or does the monster? It
is not easy to answer when each defines one another. Whether Mal Cobb
exists in reality does not matter in the film, as is the case with Dom
Cobb and all characters, all happenings, all dreams. The only truth to
be reminded is that visual and auditory sensations that the cinematic
device presents is real, that this reality continues on for a good
three hours, and that when they are over, they linger in fragmented
visions and sounds.<br /><br />Dreams are not supposed to be allegorical, or are they? Either way, if
Inception gave a good pleasurable three hours, it has accomplished its
objectives; we cannot regret having nightmares and dreams, we can only
blame ourselves having fallen asleep.<br /><br />http://www.so-rimlee.com
