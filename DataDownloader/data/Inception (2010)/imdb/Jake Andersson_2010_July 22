First of all I would like to point out that this is my first movie
review ever, and the reason I am doing is because this movie is
actually &#x22;perfect&#x22;.<br /><br />Breaking it down a bit, a whole new and original production, Nolan has
truly surpassed himself and acting is flawless. I do agree that
sometimes you feel out of touch with the main character, but the movie
is not about Cobb it is about dreams and how dreams affect people.
Nolan did not totally discard Cobb&#x27;s personal struggles, but they are
rather subtly explained throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />In the end I think this movie is original, something you will not
forget for a long long time, and you will be happy you went to watch
it. In my opinion we will wait for a good while before something this
good come out in the future.
