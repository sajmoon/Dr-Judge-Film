In my opinion the IMDb review by Carl_Tait from New York, NY is about
the best summation of the film. A great concept but lost in
translation. And to think Mr. Nolan wrote the story for &#x22;Inception&#x22;!!!
I include &#x22;Inception&#x22; among the film genre that have come to be known
as &#x22;mind**ck&#x22; films. I don&#x27;t agree with every list of films
characterized thus on the web but this is an unmistakable genre. And
&#x22;Inception&#x22; definitely belongs there.<br /><br />I suspect there are a lot of viewers out there who see a complex but
convoluted film and find it gripping because BAM!! it hits them so hard
on the head that they dare not concede they don&#x27;t understand it because
they are afraid someone will find out that they didn&#x27;t :-) But there
are a number of IMDb reviewers who have given &#x22;Inception&#x22; 10/10 or
close to that rating. The way these reviewers have articulated their
reasoning is definitely more comprehensible and cogent than the film is
in my opinion. I wish Mr. Nolan had consulted them before making the
film as I am sure they could bring some clarity to the mix.<br /><br />To my mind &#x22;Inception&#x22; has a convoluted and twisted narrative (if there
is one) which *seems* multi-layered, but actually throws just about
everything it can into the mix, never mind the sink, it throws in even
the kitchen itself. I will say that the CGI effects are pretty amazing.
But the film is overpopulated with characters and it was hard to figure
out why more than half of them were there.<br /><br />And as another reviewer commented, what the heck are the guns and
explosions doing in a film based on a shared dream paradigm.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; gave me no reason to care for any of the characters,
excepting to some degree Ellen Page&#x27;s character Ariadne. I had no
reason to care for Marion Cotillard&#x27;s character Mal, and found her
portrayal somewhat of a female stereotype playing the neurotic unhinged
foil.<br /><br />I am sure Mr. Nolan is an excellent film maker who has definitely come
into his own as far as the box office is concerned. But so far the only
films he has done that I have truly admired are &#x22;Insomnia&#x22; and &#x22;Batman
Begins&#x22;. Before &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; I was never a fan of any of the Batman
films.<br /><br />While watching &#x22;Inception&#x22; there was many a time that I felt like
stopping and watching something else but gave it the benefit of doubt
that the film might pick-up. Sorry to say it never did.<br /><br />I do hope Mr.Nolan gives a little more attention to maintaining a
narrative and character development in his films rather than just
bombarding us with complexity (or more accurately confusion!) and CGI
effects.<br /><br />All I can say is that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is exhausting viewing and represents
complexity for the sake of complexity or something like that.....
