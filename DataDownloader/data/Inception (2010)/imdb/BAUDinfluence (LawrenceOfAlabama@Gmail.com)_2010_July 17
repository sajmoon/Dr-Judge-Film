I knew, after the first few scenes of Inception, that I was going to
have to buy into this world. Unlike other better films (The Prestige,
Total Recall, and Memento) I wasn&#x27;t sold that this concept is
plausible. Perhaps it&#x27;s because of my feeble movie-going mind. Or
perhaps it&#x27;s due to the fact that the Idea &#x22;of dream entering&#x22; is not
sold to us but rather thrust upon us to set up the series of Slow Mo
scenes in dreamlike states.<br /><br />I want to say the film was fun, and Nolan is a credible director; but
to all those trying to contemplate what the film meant: I hate to be
the one to tell you that Nolan is no Lynch. There isn&#x27;t some weird
enigma wrapped in a riddle. It&#x27;s basically a fun premise executed with
a lot of slow mo C.G.I. and great actors. Enjoy the film and the
popcorn and try not to get too wrapped up into figuring it out. It does
a fine job of spoon feeding the story to you.<br /><br />THE CAKE IS A LIE!
