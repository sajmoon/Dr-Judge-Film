Guys, don&#x27;t waste your money. This is just a lousy remake of Tarkovsky
&#x22;Solaris&#x22; with modern entourage made in Hollywood, camouflaged with
some new lines without a philosophical background with some extra
bang-bang for the young generation. It&#x27;s impossible for a youth to
understand serious movie and this action-decorated replica probably
helps them to see the original masterpiece. Actually, actors&#x27;
performances are not very strong either, only Marion Cotillard tried to
set an equality with her Academy Award prize. FX are interesting, but
probably it&#x27;s the only strong point in the whole film. It&#x27;s very sad,
that Hollywood completely run out of good scripts and this is their
last idea how to attract people to a cinema.
