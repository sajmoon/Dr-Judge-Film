To begin, I want to make it absolutely clear no matter what you read in
the following article, go and see Inception. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan has been polluting the airwaves for over 10 years now
with fantastic movies such as &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; for action fans,
&#x27;Insomnia&#x27; for fans of psychological thrillers, and &#x27;Memento&#x27; for those
who like to think about a movie, a lot. But then steps forward
Inception, Nolan&#x27;s true masterpiece. It&#x27;s nothing less than perfect.
Like a combination of all his life&#x27;s work, like everything up to this
point have been mere obstacles he had to manoeuvre in order to make
this fantastic piece of work. <br /><br />The plot is so difficult to explain that it would take an entire page
just to make a dent, so lets say there&#x27;s a man called Cobb (Leo
DiCaprio) who steals things, he&#x27;s a thief. Now lets say he can some how
go into people&#x27;s dreams and there thoughts. But in order to make a more
engrossing and action packed story, lets say this time, he has to plant
an idea. That&#x27;s the very basics of what can only be described as, the
most complicated, but monumentally brilliant story every created. The
entire mythology Nolan has created around the dreamscape can only be
compared to what other film makers did with the rules of time and
space. The amazing amounts of thought and creativity that has gone into
every little detail is incredible on it&#x27;s own, but when you plan to
make a movie based AROUND this idea, not ABOUT it, then you cross the
border into pure Godliness. <br /><br />The only flaw that you can possibly spot within this labyrinth of a
movie is however, the characters and their complete lack of story and
depth. All apart from the main character, Cobb, they share equal
amounts of restricted screen time as Nolan rightfully realised that in
order to harness the story&#x27;s true power, you need to focus on the story
itself, rather than split it off into tangents every 5 seconds.
Characters such as Ellen Page&#x27;s curious architecture student Ariadne
and Tom Hardy&#x27;s truly magnificent Eames are used merely as pawns by
Nolan to tell this epic and infatuating tale of sub-conscious dreaming,
and so, they receive very little to no back story what so ever, leaving
us the audience to work this out for ourselves. A very ballsy but spot
on move from Nolan as we do start to generate feelings for these
bare-bones projections and any back stories apart from Cobb&#x27;s (which is
the key to the entire plot) would have crippled the excitingly fast
pace of the movie. <br /><br />There&#x27;s barely a moment in the entire 148 minutes when something wasn&#x27;t
being explained or dreams weren&#x27;t being explored meaning Incepion is a
movie you have to keep both eyes on at all times. Miss one thing, even
a little tiny explanation of a very small section of the dreamscape,
and you could end up completely lost. It is because of this (the
incredibly engaging plot) that when the credits roll and you are now
forced the peel your eyes from the screen, the previous 148 minutes
seems so real and so engaging, that the movie in itself felt like a
dream. And an outstanding one at that. <br /><br />Inception manages to make Nolan&#x27;s previous work look like a children&#x27;s
cartoon as far as complexity is concerned and acting-wise, it&#x27;s pretty
much on the same level. DiCaprio&#x27;s leading performance is a very
emotionally aware and painfully focused one and Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy all put in fantastic
performances also, but the fact is, they didn&#x27;t have to. Their
believable acting is just another satisfying tick on the clipboard, not
a requirement as the story takes over the entire audience&#x27;s attention.
Sure if they had been really bad it would be noticeable, but they could
have portrayed their roles in a more Hollywood-style fashion and nobody
would have realised. It is for this reason that I believe the actors
are the hidden gem of this complicated maze of a picture. <br /><br />To conclude, Inception may be the most complex and engaging films you
see all year, and if you focus purely on the movie itself and don&#x27;t get
distracted, it should be the best too. To me, Inception is Nolan&#x27;s
masterpiece and serves as a much needed kick-up-the-arse to the likes
of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich. This is how you make a movie
boys... start taking notes!<br /><br />10/10
