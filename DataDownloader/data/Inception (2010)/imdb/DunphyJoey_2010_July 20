Its been a couple of hours since I watched this new movie by
Christopher Nolan. After watching Memento,Batman Begins and Dark
Knight, I was quite confident that this would be a memorable
experience. Also the expectations were rising high and I knew that it
got good reviews, still I was able to shut myself from all of them and
see the movie fresh.<br /><br />I would rather say that I was blown away with the plot. Its something
one has never imagined of. The whole movie was so exciting and
blink-and-you-will-miss type that you will have to see it again or
rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot, just like
&#x27;Memento&#x27;. I was always fond of Nolan&#x27;s movie background sounds as it
keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Now comes the acting part. Caprio was excellent, well accompanied by
Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others. But I would rather say
that the actors didn&#x27;t got much chance to do anything. They did exactly
what the script demanded.<br /><br />The direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and
locations. Especially the dream scenes. As for the academy awards, I
expect this film to grab the prize in direction,screenplay,sound
mixing,sound editing and visual effects and may also the best
picture(not quite sure after watching Toy Story 3 few weeks back).<br /><br />Anyway, for the people who are reading this review before going to see
it, I would advise that, this would blow your mind. A must see in my
opinion because very few movies have a captivating plot and superb
direction like this one. Its an epic, go for it.
