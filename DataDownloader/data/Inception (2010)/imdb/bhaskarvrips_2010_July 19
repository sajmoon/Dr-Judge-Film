This movie is like a flawless diamond in the cinema history. Nolan has
done a brilliant piece of work in bringing out the shine of this gem.
This movie is based on the notion, &#x22;What you see is what you believe in
reality&#x85;. What you believe is what you see in your dreams&#x85;!&#x22;.<br /><br />The plot is astounding and the screenplay is extraordinary. All the
actors get completely into the movie and you feel as if they are real
professional extractors. Leo has delivered a great performance and will
be remembered as Dom Cobb for a very long time. Ellen, Ken, Joseph,
Dilip and the rest of the team gave a very good performance, which will
never allow you to miss a single frame.<br /><br />The story is very complex in nature, but Nolan has portrayed the
screenplay in a splendid fashion. So far the best of his movies and
definitely deserves the Oscar for best story and direction. We can say
this one is like a Cullinan shining in his crown.<br /><br />Music by Hans Zimmer will keep you in the real dreamy world. Not to
mention the CGI in this movie, which are quite realistic and it is hard
to tell the difference between the virtual and reality. Production
values are top notch, which makes the audience to feel the brilliance
of the movie.<br /><br />I will give away 10/10 for this splendor. I can say one of the best
movies in the decade so far. This one should be definitely watched in
theater to catch the real feeling of the movie.
