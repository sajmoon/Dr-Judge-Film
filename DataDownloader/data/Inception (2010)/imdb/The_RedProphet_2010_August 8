This aims to be Memento, but Nolan hasn&#x27;t been able to produce anything
with as much depth as Memento since his second film; I understand that
would be difficult to do as I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nolan and Memento. This
story however is extremely hallow and full of unnecessary action for
the sake of action. This is pop corn; this is bubble gum. Inception
doesn&#x27;t come close to depths of Memento. This is a very good
action/sci-fi movie, but not a great one at that. It was made to sell a
lot of tickets and a lot of popcorn, but there is no other reason this
film exists much beyond that. To try and pass this off as a deep film
is an insult to many filmmakers that came before and are still around
now. It&#x27;s even an insult to Nolan&#x27;s own Memento. This movie is based
around a trick. And maybe it&#x27;s even a good trick. Maybe it&#x27;s not? But
in the end, it feels like I watched this for the same reason I would do
a crossword puzzle or a brain tease-to have an entertaining mental
challenge for a brief moment, but this movie doesn&#x27;t go much beyond
that. I didn&#x27;t care about the characters, if Nolan wanted me to care
about these characters he would have spend more time with the
characters, gone deeper into the relationship between DiCaprio and his
wife, but instead he spent more time with silly mind tricks and
mindless gunfights so that you&#x27;d spend more on popcorn. This movie
insulted my intelligence by thinking that I&#x27;d be wooed by this empty,
hallow mind trick.
