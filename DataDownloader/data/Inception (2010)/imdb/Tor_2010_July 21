INCEPTION Is an original, cerebral, smart film, only Nolan could create
something like this, the level of detail and creation of the world of
the dream, the rules, the problems that they face, the level changes,
everything left me simply impressed.<br /><br />It may be a little confusing but it kept me at the edge of my seat
amazed at what was happening on the screen, all the actors where
excellent (Ellen Page was a little off), the music, direction,
cinematography and visual effects are all first rate.<br /><br />When the movie ends you&#x27;re still thinking about it, the ending is a
little ambiguous and heavy on debates, similar to those of Blade
Runner.<br /><br />Maybe the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that DiCaprio&#x27;s character
was the only one developed, and I would&#x27;ve liked to know more about
each person of the team.<br /><br />INCEPTION is an incredible labyrinth that lures us into the world of
the subconscious, and ends up being a dream not to be missed.<br /><br />9/10
