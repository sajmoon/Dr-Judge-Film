Each film Christopher Nolan makes just keeps on getting better and
better, and Inception is indeed his current masterpiece, Christopher
Nolan could not have made it any better.<br /><br />Filled with mind-blowing effects and a captivating plot (although
complex, the plot still keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats),
Inception brings a whole new level to the genres of Mystery and Sci-Fi.
The plot cannot be described, it&#x27;s one of those films where you just
have to go see it for yourself and revel in its originality: Inception
has to be one of the best original ideas in cinematic history.<br /><br />As for the acting, all the cast were fantastic! We see Leonardo
DiCaprio star in the emotional role of &#x27;Cobb&#x27; alongside Academy Award
winning actress Marion Cotillard who plays &#x27;Mal&#x27;, Cobb&#x27;s wife. Ken
Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Cillian Murphy also star, and they
were all nothing less than brilliant. Ellen Page was her usual best
and, we even see Michael Caine and Pete Postlethwaite in small but
significant roles.<br /><br />Wally Pfister (Christopher Nolan&#x27;s right hand man) has yet again
outshone himself with the exceptional and purely beautiful
cinematography, which to me was probably one of the best features of
the film.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer composed an incredible score, marking his third
collaboration with Christopher Nolan (following the two Batman films).
The score was very electronic and Zimmer really did unleash his
imagination in the best possible way. The main song in the film, &#xC9;dith
Piaf&#x27;s &#x22;Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien&#x22; fits in with the theme of the film
very well (Zimmer even put some elements of the song into his score).<br /><br />Inception is a thoroughly enjoyable film in which the viewer will still
be pondering / thinking about the events that have taken place long
after the credits have rolled...<br /><br />5 out of 5 (exceptional) and definitely on my top 10 list of films. A
definite contender for the 83rd Academy Awards.
