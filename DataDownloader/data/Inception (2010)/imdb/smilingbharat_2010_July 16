Christopher Nolan is a Genius.Nothing new in that.But the new thing is
that he had paired with DiCaprio this time.DiCaprio already has gem
this year with Shutter Island and now the count increases to two.The
first hour of the movie tells you everything and you wonder what is
left in the next hour and here comes the action.What was told in the
previous hour was shown practically.<br /><br />This Movie contains 3 layers and a surprising and revealing 4th
layer.The concept is brilliant, direction top notch and acting
sufficient.The music by Hanzzimmer is haunting.I earnestly hope that
this movie bags few Oscars.Let this movie be honored.One surely
remembers MATRIX during the movie.Though the concept is quite
different,the in differentiation between reality and dreaming reminds
you of Matrix.Anyways this is quite original.hats off NOLAN.But
definitely if you expect some real mindless action you&#x27;ll be
disappointed.This is Brainy thriller which keeps the viewer thinking
and guessing.So all you people who just wants a movie for
entertainment.Stay out.The remaining just enjoy this movie with your
heads on.<br /><br />Film Making at it&#x27;s Best. I gave it 8 on 10 only because I saw it just
twice.My rating might get higher on repeated viewings.
