The Dream is Real.<br /><br />Dom Cobb is a thief. In fact, he&#x27;s the best in the business. But he
specializes in a new form of theft unlike anything before it;
extraction. Dom steals peoples secrets, hidden deep in their
subconscious, by infiltrating their dreams. His rare skill has opened
the door to a lucrative, but dangerous, career in corporate espionage.
But now he finds himself unable to return to his home country, the
United States, for fear of arrest and prosecution on false charges of
murder.<br /><br />However, Dom has been given a second chance. A new job offer presents
the possibility of having the charges disappear so that he may return
to his country and his children. The catch is that he must carry out a
nearly impossible extraction deep within the subconscious of a powerful
corporate tycoon. He has a shot at redemption, but only if he can
finish the job and make it out alive.<br /><br />Inception is an intricate, complex, and fascinating movie with killer
effects and cinematography. A sci-fi thriller with lots of action and a
bit of mystery and drama to boot. It also has a good cast which
includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, Ellen Page, Cillian
Murphy, and Pete Postlethwaite amongst others. Viewers are coming to
expect a lot when Christopher Nolan releases a film, but he keeps on
delivering.
