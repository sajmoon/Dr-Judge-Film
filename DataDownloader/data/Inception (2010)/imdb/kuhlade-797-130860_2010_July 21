Bitterly disappointed! Grossly bloated with special effects, overly
saturated with testosterone and ultimately, a rip-off of two former
80&#x27;s films, Brainstorm and Dreamscape, both of which I found to have
much more substance. With a two and a half hour runtime, it quickly
became no more than an assault on the senses. Once again, I was duped
into wasting my money on an over-hyped behemoth with no redeeming
qualities. As for the performances, DiCaprio came off as being slightly
miscast, it seemed to me that he had to work a little too hard to get
his lines out. It felt like Page, whom I do adore, was thrown in at the
last minute for some token estrogen. I do always love to see Caine in
small but meaty roles, this one was small but hardly meaty. AKA
&#x27;Inception: The Imax Experience&#x27; says it all. Basically, just a
showcase for SFX on a very big screen.
