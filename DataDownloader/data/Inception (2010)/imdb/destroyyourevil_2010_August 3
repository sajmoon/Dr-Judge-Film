I said that the second the movie began. Was it ever magical. This was
unlike anything I have ever seen.<br /><br />I came to think it&#x27;d be my type of movie and it is. Everything made
sense even though it was a dream in a dream in a dream. It all felt so
real (I never guessed dreams would be faster than time). It was
well-written because I felt a lot.<br /><br />I found every effect believable. They did a great job with the slow
time, camera angles, and the gravity defiance. Everything in the dreams
were believable. I really felt like it actually happened.<br /><br />The cast was good too. Leo is a very skilled actor. The actors showed
great emotion and motivation.<br /><br />This may have been the best movie I have ever seen. It was outstanding
and epic. By the time I left the theatre, I was just speechless. I
loved the acting and cast, the epic storyline, and amazing effects.
