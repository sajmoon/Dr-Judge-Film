Inception has taken me into a trans which will linger on for days,its a
state of limbo which is ineffable and i am enjoying it.The fact that
Nolan is an excellent director is well known,but Nolan as an excellent
writer is proved beyond recognition.And who would forget my best actor
Leo,with every passing year and with each gray strands he develops, he
just stands out from the others as an epitome of acting and honest
performance of the highest degree.I doubt there are many actors
remaining in the industry to match Leo&#x27;s caliber and still he hasn&#x27;t
won an Oscar i pity the Academy. So, goes the saying as Sophocles once
said..&#x22;Wonders are many,but the most wonderful of all is human
mind&#x22;....we are still trying to understand and comprehend the
fathomless mysteries which reside within the mind.
