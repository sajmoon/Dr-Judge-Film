When I first saw the early 2009 trailer of this movie I was intrigued
because I knew this time Nolan will not repeat himself in a brilliant
breathtaking action movies like he made before in his new Batman or the
deep thriller he represented in &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; or the mind-blowing
&#x22;Memento&#x22;<br /><br />No, This time Nolan will make his crown jewelry his own masterpiece.<br /><br />This time Nolan will teach us how to make a thriller-action-psycho-mind
blowing with intelligent science tricks movie .<br /><br />And when I saw &#x22;INCEPTION&#x22; yesterday I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. In the
first few minutes you will be bolted in your chair trying to get the
grasp of what is going on around you. I can only describe it as the
same reaction when you first saw &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;. There is certain rules
going on you can&#x27;t understand, which will begin to reveal its meanings
after a while.<br /><br />Cobb &#x22;Dicaprio&#x22; is a strange character-reminds you of &#x22;Teddy Daniels&#x22;
at his last &#x22; Shutter Island&#x22;-his job is stealing the ideas from the
industries&#x27; pioneers by tricking them in their dream state to reveal
their secrets.<br /><br />This is the main character the film is all about, around him a clever
cast of Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken watanabe,
Dileep Rao and Michael caine to support him in his new &#x22;mission
impossible-like&#x22; job.<br /><br />The job is instead of stealing an idea is to put a new one in the mind
of a rich industry heir &#x22;Cillian Murphy&#x22; by putting him in a deep three
level dream in order to reach to the core of his mind to plant this
idea.<br /><br />During the film you will discover the danger they put themselves into
by doing so, and that Cobb &#x22;Dicaprio&#x22; is hiding a secrets of his own.
Also a several shift between different dreams happening in the same
time away from what is happening in reality with a time perspective
change which was a surreal experience. <br /><br />A twist of brilliant camera,visual,action &#x26; science tricks is the main
theme of this movie, you can&#x27;t trust any of your senses, you can&#x27;t make
the difference between dreams and reality, you are caught up in-between
all the time. I can&#x27;t describe it really only by that you don&#x27;t know if
you took the blue pill or the red one as like in &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, and
maybe it is much worse because during the movie you won&#x27;t know whether
you are dreaming or watching a movie in a cinema - or maybe its just me
- :)<br /><br />The final words that Nolan has answered the question of why the cinema
won&#x27;t die, by showing us that there is still a huge creative space
waiting to be discovered.
