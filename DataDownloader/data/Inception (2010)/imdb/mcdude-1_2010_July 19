I wanted to like Inception, I really did. I tried so hard to like it.
So many of my friends loved it. I thought I would love it. First of
all, the story takes forever to get going. The slow pace at the
beginning of the film is nauseating. And there is no explaining of what
exactly they put on their arms? Or did I douse off during that? <br /><br />The drastic, loud music is there to make the movie more suspenseful
than it really is. Which I kindly had to explain to my girl friend. If
the music wasn&#x27;t there, you really wouldn&#x27;t have thought it was that
suspenseful/thrilling. <br /><br />People have compared this to Matrix. Right, I sort of get that. But the
Matrix was SO ground breaking! The Matrix made you love Neo and the
action was supposed to be in the film. Inception the action feels
forced. This isn&#x27;t a thriller it was an Action Film. Mindless dribble
talked about felt as if they were mumbling -- once you get that you get
a bunch of characters you don&#x27;t care about. Leo crying about his family
AGAIN?! How many movies can I take with him crying about his family?<br /><br />All the action in the film and the different scenery reminded me much
more of a James Bond film than anything. Go from the City, to the Snowy
White Mountains to The Beach. I was just waiting for James Bond to come
in on a silver coupe BMW and say, &#x22;Bond, James Bond.&#x22; <br /><br />Sure you don&#x27;t ever want to compare films to other movies. But look at
Shutter Island and compare it to this. A lot of people didn&#x27;t like
Shutter Island, and those same people LOVE Inception. Shutter Island
was classic film making. This is a modern action film.<br /><br />People also need to watch Memento. Watch how this movie should have
been done.
