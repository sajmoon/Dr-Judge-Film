Visually interesting and innovative, yet pretentious. It has an
excellent cast with great performances. The complexity of its story
works perfectly in the way of confusing us. It&#x27;s easy to think that
something that we don&#x27;t fully understand is great. It&#x27;s easy to see how
so many people liked the film so much. There are plenty of alleged
subtleties and symbols which the fans are so eager to comment. Everyone
can write a script that is complex. It only needs not be completely
logic.<br /><br />I prefer a narrative that is simple but at the same time thick. This is
harder to do.<br /><br />Far from being a masterpiece, extremely overrated.
