I didn&#x27;t think there could be a director who could amaze me twice in a
life time. What he&#x27;s done is much more than just amazement.<br /><br />Nolan is known for his bewildering psychological thrillers that usually
start out with the last scene, which is normally the key to
understanding the rest of the film confusing you from the start. This
is not the exception.<br /><br />Inception doesn&#x27;t underestimate the viewer, it doesn&#x27;t take you by the
hand and lead you easily through explaining and laying it all out for
you. <br /><br />Its complicated yes. Hence the beauty and uniqueness of it. <br /><br />There are never unnecessary dialogs, in fact everything that is said is
majestically planned and is there for a reason, while also being
amusing and clever.<br /><br />Though it may seem like at some point you&#x27;re just being over loaded
with information, but you mustn&#x27;t worry, with Nolan everything gets
explained and laydout perfectly into place by the time its done.<br /><br />Its a cinematographic puzzle that also has time for jokes. This is the
perfect example of a movie where everything is hand picked in order for
greatness. From the wonderful score that only enhances the magnitude of
the scenes and excitement of the moments, to the great actors.<br /><br />The deepness of the characters is so well reflected you get caught up
in the emotion of it all, even with all the complex events happening
around them.<br /><br />Its like one big trailer, the intensity of the actions, emotions and
music never wear off, they&#x27;re there from beginning to end. With such an
epic finale that had the whole theater in one big gasp.<br /><br />Now visually Nolan always tries to use the least amount of CGI as
possible, and fits in the most amazing interior design and architecture
you could have in a film, with its astonishing visuals you&#x27;re loured
into the story to a higher extent.<br /><br />Films like these come once in a life time and I am glad I had the
opportunity to live this experience. For you do not watch these films
you LIVE them.<br /><br />For those of you who haven&#x27;t seen it yet:<br /><br />I&#x27;ve summarized the story as much as possible without revealing major
parts and spoiling it for you.<br /><br />We accompany a thief of dreams, now he is not the &#x27;bad guy&#x27; for in
inception the story is much to complex for &#x27;good guy bad guy&#x27;
stereotypes. Its absolutely more then that.<br /><br />Cobb (the thief) played by the respected/wonderful/kickass Leo
DiCaprio, gets an illegal job proposal by Saito played by the fantastic
Ken Watanabe, to implant (incept) an idea into a mans (Cillian Murphy
*swoon*) subconscious.<br /><br />Cobb hires a crew to help him with this task: Arthur (Joseph Gordon-
Levitt) Eames (Tom Hardy) whom spice up the movie and ease situations
when things are getting to dramatic and Ariadne (one of my fav.
actresses Ellen Page) who is the newcomer on the team. She learns as
she goes on just like the audience.<br /><br />Trust me this is just the tip of the ice berg but if I were to reveal
anything more it&#x27;d be too much.<br /><br />Inception isn&#x27;t just the summer blockbuster, its a life time classic.
