I have been reluctant to comment on Inception; there seemed little I
could add to the already extensive commentary. My initial sense was
that Inception, while it was a welcome relief to standard summer fare,
possessed enough flaws and precedents to render its claims to greatness
suspect. I gave it 8 stars over my first viewing and let it go at that. <br /><br />Now, having watched Inception twice since then and having read the
screenplay (see the excellent, Inception: The Screenplay), I have
changed my mind. Inception is worthy of the praise given it. Without
reservation I now give it a 10. This is the first occasion in which I
have changed my verdict on a film following my initial viewing. Why?
Because Inception is easily the best film of the decade in terms of
sheer intelligence, the best film I would argue since The Truman Show.
Moreover, its plot of obsessive love, fear of falling, and frightening
dreams, makes it worthy of comparison to Vertigo. As good as Vertigo?
The fact that Inception can be mentioned without blanching in the same
sentence with Hitchcock&#x27;s masterpiece tells you something. <br /><br />I came to love the movie but I was desperate to say something new. I
wanted to comment on the richness of the world of Inception, and give
the viewer a bit more of an understanding of what underlies it. <br /><br />In the near future, a drug has been discovered that enables people to
share a common dream. Viewed by many as a fascinating opportunity for
creativity, one danger is that a dreamer&#x27;s mind can be invaded by an
intruder and unless the victim has been trained to resist these
&#x22;extractor(s),&#x22; he can be tricked into revealing his innermost secrets
(visualized as being within a symbolic dream &#x22;safe&#x22;). The battle
between a trained mark and one or more skilled extractors can be
harrowing. <br /><br />This technology can be described as a form of controlled lucid
dreaming. Until this discovery, all experience had been that lucid
dreams cannot be controlled; anything could happen. Since most people
have had them, you know what I mean. But using this drug and its
delivery system (termed PASIV in the screenplay book), lucid dreams can
be controlled. These shared lucid dreams, however, are still subject to
external conditions and the dreamer&#x27;s own internal state. <br /><br />Note: the idea of entering into people minds while they are dreaming is
not new. See the movie &#x22;Dreamscape (1984),&#x22; which has dream specialists
invading the mark, as protectors or attackers. But there are some
remarkable new angles in Inception&#x27;s approach. <br /><br />First, the dreams can be recursive. There can be dreams within dreams
within dreams, though at each additional level the dream state becomes
increasingly unstable, requiring the addition of powerful sedatives to
maintain control. <br /><br />Second, the recursive levels cannot be extended indefinitely. They
terminate in a state called &#x22;Limbo,&#x22; i.e. &#x22;unconstructed dreamspace.&#x22;
Limbo may be infinite in expanse. Little is known of it, though
according to the movie&#x27;s math, time moves roughly 8000 times faster in
Limbo relative to reality. <br /><br />Third, the minds of the participants, particularly if there is an
emotional involvement between them, can find their dream &#x22;waves&#x22; have
become blended or entangled.<br /><br />There are profound metaphysical dangers in this, ontological and
psychological. Foremost is the loss of one&#x27;s sense of what is real,
over time being increasingly unable to distinguish between the dream
state and reality. Then there is the loss of one&#x27;s sense of self. Where
the dreamers are emotionally involved, e.g. in love, their minds can
begin to merge to such an extent that it is a difficult for them to
determine where &#x22;I&#x22; begins and the other takes over, who is dreaming
what in other words. There are mechanisms, &#x22;totems&#x22; for keeping track
of where one is in these dream spaces, but the problem is unsolved.<br /><br />Into this world strides Dom Cobb, one of the best &#x22;extractors,&#x22; a
disturbed, troubled man, with overwhelming feelings of guilt towards is
dead wife, Mal. Cobb is desperately seeking an escape, and return home
to the only happiness he has ever known. <br /><br />Inception is strikingly original not only in that it introduces a new
technology but a new terminology as well. A shoe-in for multiple
nominations, it is brilliantly edited with a superb score,
special-effects, and a wonderfully, attractive and likable cast.
Nolan&#x27;s meticulous screenplay pursues its sober and somber plot (you
may smile/chuckle a few times but that is it) with grace and
high-intelligence.<br /><br />I wish I could sum up the meaning of the movie, but I can&#x27;t. One
possibility is that Inception is an allegory of the movie experience, a
dream of movies if you will. There is a strong overlap in what Cobb and
his team are pursuing with the movie experience itself as a shared
dream in which we share our emotional secrets. Nolan plays on this, but
the idea of a movie as reflexive of and subversive to one&#x27;s life has
been often done and it is unclear if Inception adds much. <br /><br />Another is that Inception should be taken as a movie of dreams, i.e. on
its own terms; that it works best if one simply accepts what is being
shown on the screen and goes with it. Admittedly, for most, multiple
viewings will be required to enable them to get to the heart of the
movie&#x27;s emotions but they will be amply rewarded if they do. The
central vision in Inception of life&#x27;s tragedy is compelling. Whether in
the dream state or in reality, we cannot escape ourselves and it is
impossible to tell if the happiness we have is real or an illusion.
