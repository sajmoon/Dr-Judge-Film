even if you go in with high expectations you will come out
astonishingly praising the director and the crew in mind.yes,Chris
Nolan has done it again.<br /><br />you wont even take an eye or your mind even for a second till the
end.once again Nolan has proved that not every thing depends on how
great the story was but the way you present it.with an exceptional
directing skills,good casting,haunting music by Hans Zimmer and a
brilliant editing and cinematography,inception blew you minds off and
special Thanks to the outstanding performance&#x27;s from DiCaprio and
Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />The reason for loving this film is that its not a kind of rubbish
meaningless high budget action flick.you have to keep your memory in
mind to watch this movie from the very inception.<br /><br />A must watch movie worth&#x27;s your every single penny spent on it.cheers
to Chris Nolan 10/10 for his dreams.don&#x27;t miss it in theaters <br /><br />in one word &#x22;Inception is Exceptional&#x22;.
