Nice try at making a movie that isn&#x27;t a remake, sequel, or based on a
book. Doesn&#x27;t work in the end, though. Transparent, easy-to-guess plot
with no twists, ho-hum action scenes, and no real conflict. And the key
to the main character knowing he&#x27;s in the &#x22;real world&#x22; is that he has a
top that never stops spinning?!?! Huh? Did anyone check the script to
realize that perpetual motion belongs in the DREAM part of this movie?<br /><br />Clumsy film. I love sci-fi, love Nolan&#x27;s other flicks, even thought
DiCaprio was pretty good, but didn&#x27;t make up for such boredom and
nonsense. This is far from a &#x22;masterpiece.&#x22; Basically it&#x27;s a remake of
the Matrix for people who thought the Matrix was &#x22;too sci-fi&#x22;.
