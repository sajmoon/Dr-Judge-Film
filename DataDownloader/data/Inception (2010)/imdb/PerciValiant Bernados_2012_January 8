It is a movie that is complete in story, screenplay, cinematography,
special effects, thrill and suspense. There&#x27;s a bit of drama and comedy
as well. The fascinating part is that you&#x27;ll have to connect the dots
in the film to really get what&#x27;s going on. You will be engaged into it.
I was drawn by the trailer then and told myself that it&#x27;s worth the
penny. And it did, exceedingly. I watched it alone that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so
focused on it, connecting one dream to another. Christopher Nolan knows
how to edit film in a way that it forms a bigger puzzle until the whole
film is seen as a very big picture with depth. :) Very nice Chris
Nolan!!!! I haven&#x27;t seen Memento, but I will, definitely.
