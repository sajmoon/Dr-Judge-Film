9.4? ? ? ? ? Wow I went and saw it tonight because of all the Hype. I
decided to stay level headed because the previews did not look that
great. I went into it with medium expectations, and it was still a huge
let down. Honestly I would give it a 3/10 for its cinematography and
effects. It lacks everything everything that makes a great or even a
good movie. The characters weren&#x27;t developed besides Leonardo&#x27;s and
they were all bland and uninteresting. There are about 4 different
subplot-like events going on and it creates for the viewer to be very
disconnected, you never sympathize or empathize for anyone or anything
in the movie, let alone give a damn about its very uninteresting story.
The story was all over the place dragged out and bland, I felt
disconnected from the whole plot. Good premiss, cool idea, good
graphics.... Story was border line awful, acting was just average for
such good actors, the characters were bland and sucked, the dialogue
got wacky and pretty out there and didn&#x27;t even make sense at times. the
cinematography was all over the place. These past 2 years the IMDb
rating has been corrupted or screwed. This is not, not, not a great or
even a good movie. One of my least favorite Decaprio and Nolans films.
The Dark Knight must have got to his head. Could we see another lost
director like Tarentino? Apparently not to general audience who are
apparently mindlessly entertained and think everything that is
confusing is wonderful.
