An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can do anything. That&#x27;s what
Christopher Nolan (Director) wants to resuscitate us. I&#x27;m amazed by
Nolan who always could tell such a complicated story so smooth. He has
already proved his capability on his previous works, such as: &#x22;Batman
Begins&#x22; (2005), &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; (2008), and sophisticated magician&#x27;s
tale in &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; (2006). But I prefer to compare thiz one with
his earlier masterpiece &#x22;Memento&#x22; (2000). What he was good at, not just
a great story-teller (I think he&#x27;s the best in our generation) but he
always made a brilliant twist and turn in every ending of his stories.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; contains multi layer story-telling which tremendously
executed well, precise what we saw on &#x22;Memento&#x22;. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is simply
a bigger scale of &#x22;Memento&#x22;. The story tells how Dom Cobb (Leonardo
DiCaprio) and his team could invade to people&#x27;s minds through their
dream, and Cobb&#x27;s job is to steal it, or plant a new one. The
supporting Casts were amazing, fills with the heavy-caliber Actors such
as: Michael Caine, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Ken Watanabe and others. In my
notes, Dicaprio wasn&#x27;t better than his performance on &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;
(2010, early thiz year), but definitely also not a bad one either. Once
again, he&#x27;s success with his script selections and delivers some
constant performances. Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy, both of them had
just showed their extraordinary performances on &#x22;Peacock&#x22; (2010). I
have to say Murphy brings one of the best performances for overall. But
the best appearance is belongs to Marion Cottilard as Cobb&#x27;s vulnerable
wife. The side-story about the dark past of Cobb and his wife draws my
attention. The chemistry and that background story were one of the
interesting parts from thiz movie. I could easily say, &#x27;The Folding
City&#x27; and &#x27;Revolving Room&#x27; scenes will be one of the memorable moments
in cinematic history. Thiz time, Nolan takes us to his dream, where an
idea becomes seed of possibility. A great opening, a nice built concept
for the main plot and deceitful twist of ending, it&#x27;s all we needed for
new level of ingenious movie. Simply, experience your life through
Dream.<br /><br />Visit My Blog on JONNY&#x27;S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com
