Visually the cinematography was excellent. The story was weak and I am
shocked how many people are giving this 10 stars. 8 people I worked
with saw this and only 1 liked it. This is two weird movies in a row
made by Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />I feel like Nolan is just revamping parts of Memento, Batman, Dark
Knight etc to his movies. The ending credits are the same for every
movie. He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the
beginning of Batman Returns. And what about that snow? It&#x27;s like he
just wanted to say let&#x27;s film in the snow! He is actually stealing a
lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an
original movie. This movie is Ocean&#x27;s Eleven meets The Island. I was
very disappointed.
