Inception was okay steals from Total Recall, The Matrix, James Bond,
Paprika and Vanilla Sky.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan made the story confusing and added as many action
scenes as possible so you won&#x27;t want to work out what was going on. The
characters were all one dimensional and I didn&#x27;t care for any one. If
you liked The Matrix then this is for you.<br /><br />Dream within a dream stuff was all too much for me, the same people
running around at the same time very challenging to keep track of the
story, the premise was all too confusing for me.<br /><br />Five minutes in real life is an hour in dream time and a dream within a
dream can be a lifetime oh stop! I can take it any more.<br /><br />I say just forget the story enjoy the set pieces, the special effects
and the riveting action. Forget about character development there is
none.<br /><br />Always nice to see Ellen Page she&#x27;s a great little actress shame she
was given nothing to do. <br /><br />Nothing new about this concept. <br /><br />I would give it 5 out of ten and that&#x27;s just because the action was
cool.
