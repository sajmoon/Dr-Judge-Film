This movie is truly breath taking and one of the best in a long time.
It is beautiful aesthetically and the score written for it is powerful.
Leonardo does an amazing job in his role and portrays his character
with sheer genius. I&#x27;ve seen it twice already this week and I normally
don&#x27;t like seeing the same movie twice in one years time, let alone a
week. I would recommend this movie to any one that likes to really
watch a movie and pay attention to every detail. Do not go to see this
if you are just a casual movie watcher and cant pay attention for very
long. It is very easy to pay attention to though in my opinion. i would
not take a date to see this, go with friends that are into movies or
see it on your own.
