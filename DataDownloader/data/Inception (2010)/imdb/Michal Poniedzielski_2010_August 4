... and I was full of hope that it would be rather like Stevie Wonder
:)<br /><br />Comparing Inception (2010) with The Matrix (1997) is inevitable. The
same concept defines both of them - the concept of perceiving the
reality (or rather &#x22;mispercieving&#x22;). And the same flaw of choosing not
precisely the right way to tell the concept, ruins the final impression
- the flaw of being pretentious.<br /><br />Matrix was very pretentious. It was pretentious enough to became a
religion. Inception is not so. But still lacks the serious tone. I mean
who the hell names the girl who builds mind labyrinths Ariadne??? It&#x27;s
SO OBVIOUS symbolism. And it&#x27;s unnecessary - the whole concept needs
realistic grounding or poetic quotation marks rather than references to
mythology. Those quotations and groundings are delivered by Marion
Cotillard (who is the most frightening ex I&#x27;ve seen in movies a long
time). Her interpretation of Cobbs wife, Mal is a little treasure in
that shallow chest. She makes this movie a tale about HUMANS instead of
CHARACTERS. But everyone else in the team don&#x27;t have that intuition.<br /><br />Except her, everything is more or less pretentious. Screenplay -
besides quite original concept - spoils the fun by very bad dialogs,
and predictable scenes (like for example the scene of testing Ariadne
by Cobb, based on the &#x22;rule of three&#x22; - two mistakes gives you last
chance to win). Next - we have here very poor director&#x27;s and
screenwriter&#x27;s imagination revealed in quite boring or random creation
of worlds visited by our team (and I don&#x27;t want those worlds to be
second Pandora from Avatar (2010). I want them to be less Cameron, more
Lynch.) We have here very cheap &#x22;entertaining while learning&#x22;
directing. The ways chosen by Nolan to describe the audience rules of
dreaming are like from TV show Colombo - straight forward. Like the
Infinite Staircase, or bunch of scenes where someone finds the way of
solving some problem, and Cobb tells that&#x27;s impossible, because... in
dreams it&#x27;s impossible. Gee, it&#x27;s like reading an article in Newsweek!
And because of those big expectations and &#x22;masterpiece&#x22; reviews I must
to say this - this movie is too boring to be a masterpiece. I felt some
suspense in few scenes (with Mal mainly), but the pacing is rather
...random and - sad thing to say - in the majority f the screen time,
it&#x27;s a result of constant background music.<br /><br />I think, that this movie should be a book in first place. Or maybe I
should be like 10 years younger to be amused.
