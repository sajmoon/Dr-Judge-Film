Why does this movie have such a high rating? I do not get it or the
movie itself, for that matter. It just do not make any sense to me.
When I saw this movie, I walked out of the theatre feeling so confused
and having mixed feelings of unhappiness for the most part and parts of
happiness for the parts I liked, which were the ones with special
effects. My wife loved this movie, I did not. I tried to really watch
close and pay attention, but I still didn&#x27;t get it. At all. Sorry for
the low rating, everybody else seems to love this movie. Oh well, I
can&#x27;t say the same thing if I don&#x27;t understand what was happening.
Anyone who wants to offer an explanation can feel free to explain. I
will welcome any explanation offered. Maybe I will enjoy the movie more
the next time I watch it. I hope to get to watch it again soon. That
would be good.
