What really differs this movie from other movies with complex plots is
that it is extremely logical. Yes, you have to pay attention, yes in
some parts it might be difficult to &#x27;catch up&#x27; but still you don&#x27;t have
to make notes for movie pieces to come together. Take for example
Donnie Darko which is a great movie, but it lacks that kind of
integrity Nolan&#x27;s movies have. Do you really understand all that was
happening in DD? I&#x27;ve seen and heard different explanations but not one
of them explains all of the movie. Nolan&#x27;s movies on the other hand may
keep you clueless up to some point but if you pay attention you get
rewarded by explanation that is clean and logical.
