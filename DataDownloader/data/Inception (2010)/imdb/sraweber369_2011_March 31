Christopher Nolan one of the best directors working today has made an
action masterpiece made more interesting being wrapped in a good
science fiction scenario. The action is well paced and believable in
the context of the world in which it happens which happens to be a
dream world.<br /><br />The story is about an interesting operative Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)
who is not allowed back in America because he is accused of killing is
wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who keeps showing up in the dream
sequences. To get back home to his children Cobb must implant an idea
into Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) mind.<br /><br />At heart this is an action movie no unlike one of Nolan&#x27;s favorite bond
flicks On Her Majesties Secret Service which also sported great skiing
stunts and mountain snow fortress. The story has enough plot twist to
keep the viewer on his toes, and the editing is superb in building
tension.<br /><br />A very exciting and intelligent film, Grade A-
