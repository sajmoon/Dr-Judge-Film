As a long time lurker on IMDb, I&#x27;ve slowly been working my way through
the top 250. I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I
have ever seen before, despite the hype.<br /><br />I was gripped from start to finish. An amazing concept backed up with
emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes. I spent the
entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have
actually happened, such is the depth of the story. Never before has a
film had such an impact on me - I woke this morning to the realisation
that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy, for the
first time in years.<br /><br />This film is the reason I&#x27;ve finally signed up to this website. I&#x27;m a
massive fan of films such as &#x27;The Shawshank Redemption&#x27; and &#x27;The
Godfather&#x27;, but in my opinion, this raises the bar. And that&#x27;s coming
from somebody who is generally not the biggest Sci-Fi fan.<br /><br />If there&#x27;s ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to
see it is this, before it&#x27;s too late. An absolute must see, and it
would be a travesty if it did not make its way to its rightful position
in at least the IMDb top 10.
