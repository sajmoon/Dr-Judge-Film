I have always been in the pro-Avatar team. I personally and truly
believed it was one of the most perfect pieces of modern cinema. Say
what you will about the writing and acting, but the directing,
cinematography and CGI all trump the cons and elevate it to a superior
cinematic standing practically unmatched. That is, until I saw
Inception.<br /><br />If you hated Avatar and the rating it got, well you haven&#x27;t got
anything on my reaction after seeing Inception. I&#x27;m actually ashamed at
where they stand now in comparison to each other (though I previously
believed Avatar should be one of the highest rated films on IMDb). If
Avatar deserves an 8.4, then Inception should get at least a 9.7. If
Inception gets a 9.3, then Avatar should be an 8.1. Either way
something has to change, because Inception is so near perfect in every
cinematic aspect it is truly astounding. The sequences in the film were
some of, if not the best, I have ever seen. Genius does not even begin
to describe Mr. Nolan. He is truly a cinematic God.<br /><br />The perfection of Inception cannot be defined by a number. I cannot
just say it is an eight, or a nine, or a ten. It is in fact infinite.
Think of it this way. No matter how good anyone thinks Inception will
be, it will ALWAYS turn out to be many times better. Even if you were
prepared to think it as the pinnacle of cinema. Every expectation I had
of this film was not simply exceeded &#x96; they were completely blown out
of the water.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve watched a lot of movies in my life; most of them in cinemas, and
most of them on opening day. And I have quite honestly never felt a
reaction at the end of a film like that of Inception. There was quite
literally a moment of awed silence followed by a unanimous wow. People
actually stayed until the end of the credits not because they were
waiting for a final scene but because they were deep in talk about the
film already and literally did not want to leave the cinema at all.
This is what filmmakers have always tried to achieve, and what
Christopher Nolan not only succeeded in doing, but succeeded in doing
in such a superior way. This film captures everything that is superb
about Christopher Nolan, about his filmmaking, about his films. It is
all his fantastic films wrapped into one, and that&#x27;s what makes it his
best, and why you should believe in the hype surrounding this man and
this film.<br /><br />I cannot of course speak for everybody, and this may not be the best
film you will ever see. But I am willing to bet it will certainly be
one of the best films anyone will ever see. If there&#x27;s one movie that
you&#x27;re going to see twice this year (believe me, once is not enough),
it will be Inception. I&#x27;m already pooling money to see it win Best
Picture in 2011. And that DiCaprio, Page, Hardy, Cotillard and
Gordon-Levitt will at least be nominated. It will be a cinematic shame
if they weren&#x27;t.<br /><br />Forget wormholes and time-travel. The new era is dreams.
