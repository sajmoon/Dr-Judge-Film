Oh my goodness!! Are you kiddin&#x27; me?? Can there be any more complicated
thinking and intelligent movie making than this? I would say no after
seeing this one. This is a masterpiece of Christopher Nolan. I think he
established himself as the master psychological thrillers genre.<br /><br />. I don&#x27;t know somebody ever even thought about the concepts of
planting an idea to someone&#x27;s brain while asleep. To construct a movie
of this finesse is not an easy task. No wonder that Nolan took almost a
decade to develop and complete the screenplay. <br /><br />If you want to forget the world and yourself in a fantasized world for
two hours, if you want to tax and tease your brain a little bit, then
this one is for you. It takes a genius to understand everything in a
single shot.
