Where to begin to discuss a movie where only superlatives apply?
Acting, brilliant, especially the principals, DiCaprio, Marion
Cotillard, Ellen Page, and incredible supporting turns by Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe.<br /><br />At once, idiosyncratic, sweeping, thrilling, and as layered as a
master&#x27;s chess match, Christopher Nolan has excelled in his sheer
brilliance at redefining cinema, and the unfolding of a story as
nuanced as the perfect acting within it. In a way, this is fitting, for
this is a movie within a movie, realities within realities. <br /><br />There may be a handful of detractors, but this movie deserves the
praise, the rating it already reflects on IMDb, and the acclaim it is
receiving. In a way, it has the feel of &#x22;Memento&#x22;, to the extent that
time is a conceit within the movie. However, despite glorious
cinematography, global locations, and state of the art effects, this
movie never insults its audience, and doesn&#x27;t rely on any resolution
that isn&#x27;t firmly a part of the established parameters of the story.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t believe in waxing poetic over a movie, unless it is a deserving
classic, presents some thought provoking commentary, or is something
that has never been seen before. The latter is so rare in cinema, that
such a movie usually comes to define a generation, or mark a moment in
film history. This is that movie. This is the &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; of this new
era in film-making. Once upon a time George Lucas reinvented the
science fiction genre, and made cinema history in the process.
Christopher Nolan has matched this newly imagined movie making, and in
doing so, has set the bar extremely high for anyone looking to combine
action, drama, thriller, mystery, love story, espionage and re-imagined
reality. <br /><br />After walking out of this movie, you may question what is, or isn&#x27;t,
real. Are you awake, or dreaming? Christopher Nolan may cause you to
question just what you think you know.<br /><br />A ten if ever there was one! A must see!!
