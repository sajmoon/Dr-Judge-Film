This is not a good movie. This is not an original movie. The story is
not entertaining. There is no moral support to the behaviour conduct of
the characters. There&#x27;s a bunch of stupid rules one must obey to handle
with certain subconscious layer. Can this movie be compare with Matrix?
yes. But is comparable? no! Why? Matrix is one of the best sci-fi
movies ever; this one is not. It pretends to be a great movie, it
pretends to be smart; they try to make intelligent dialogues and
original plot...but they are just trying...nothing gets out of there!
It&#x27;s very easy to get it...the story...the layers...the subconscious,
the ego, the alter-ego, the id...but what do they do with this
concepts? the usual clich&#xE9;...the struggle between the instances of the
personality. Nothing original...no entertainment...no good action. This
is just another sci-fi movie, nothing else
