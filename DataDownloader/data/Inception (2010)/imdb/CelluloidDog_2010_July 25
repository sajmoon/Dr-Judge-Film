I saw this movie with a big group of 10. I would guess the group&#x27;s
rating might be an 8.5, very enjoyable! Personally I was one of the 2-3
least gripped maybe because I&#x27;ve seen too many movies. The 9.3 rating
on IMDb is enthusiasm in a bubble. And bubbles do burst. Those
mesmerized will vote this film as fun as a roller coaster - pop
entertainment but no masterpiece. That said, it is best to compare this
as one of the latest rides in Universal Studios theme park rather than
belonging in the halls of cinema&#x27;s greatest films. For pure
entertainment, Inception gets a 8.5 in an IMAX theatre so it really
helped when they talked about a &#x22;kick&#x22; and your seat gets a kick. Nolan
tends to give us kicks for thought. Comparatively Nolan&#x27;s Memento is a
bit creative and the ending of the Prestige bizarrely entertaining and
horrifying. In general, Inception has more firepower than either The
Prestige or Memento. Its special effects and editing are exquisitely
done and captivates the audience. So it is entertainment on high
adrenalin.<br /><br />As a film, however, Inception is at times awkward and confusing.
Perhaps that sets up the audience for the dreams. The reality check was
the 747 and the totems the characters used. The script is generic and
simple but there are psychoanalytic allegories. One of the
screenwriters must have been a chess player since the whole mind game
evolves from that and references to Robert Fischer, the prey of the
mind criminals, could be mistaken for the American grandmaster. The
idea of him seizing his father&#x27;s empire (the chessboard and the desire
to kill one&#x27;s father, as in the Oedipus complex) is psycho-babble.
Inception takes this theme subtly with the implicit use of Ariadne
Ellen Page&#x27;s pawn totem. The characters are all pawns in chess dream. <br /><br />We always speculate on dream control and whether falling means death.
Much of the dream states are unimaginative clich&#xE9;s, however, the
layering of them makes it interesting. Leonardo&#x27;s last movie, Shutter
Island, was a better blur between reality and fantasy. We see Inception
as an intellectual challenge, but it is more a technical challenge
which leaves the characters and the real story undeveloped. What is the
real underlying story? I think it is Dorn Cobb&#x27;s desire to reunite with
his dead wife and with his children. <br /><br />In fact, given the brass top totem is not Dorn&#x27;s (Leonardo&#x27;s), but
belongs to his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), one wonders at the end
whether it is a dream or not. The mind crime was a dream and the
reality was an ordinary man traveling to visit his family after his
wife dies. Note at the end, none of the characters acknowledge each
other. The only person who recognizes Dorn is his father played by
Michael Caine. One could argue that they are trying to keep anonymous
as Fischer is present. Or perhaps Dorn dreamt up the whole movie and
only the end is the real part.<br /><br />Nolan is a great technical director, the special efforts are great and
not overdone, and the movie grips the audience much like a roller
coaster. But the script is a bit spotty, the plot perhaps deliberately
muddled and the emotional story of Dorn and his wife doesn&#x27;t quite
unfold. None of the actors except Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon- Levitt
really make the best use of their roles. Leonardo was solid but he&#x27;s
had better performances. Michael Caine&#x27;s role is innocuous, but quite
charming. Marion Cotillard is effective and plays a significant role
but perhaps we could see more of her. <br /><br />Nolan surpasses Memento but doesn&#x27;t match up to the Matrix which still
holds the lead for mind-bending action-scifi. Regardless, as Alfred
Hitchcock raised the mystery to an art form, Nolan pushes the complex
sci-fi thriller. In the end, he isn&#x27;t quite a master as Hitchcock, but
he remains one of the finer directors today.
