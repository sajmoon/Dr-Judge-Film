Christopher Nolan is back again, this time with Leonardo DiCaprio. It
always spark when two talented stars meet. The astonishing director who
presented some masterpieces such as Memento, The Prestige, Batman
Begins, The Dark Knight etc. has astonished us again with this new age
sci-fiction thriller Inception. Nolan always commit himself on a
different kind of film-making technique, from his own views and angles,
ultimately gets successful to attract all type of audiences.<br /><br />Inception has been promoted with tag-lines of &#x22;James Bond meets The
Matrix&#x22;, or Nolan himself termed it as &#x22;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven meets The
Matrix&#x22;. Definitely the movie has both the touches of James Bond
series, and somewhat with Ocean&#x27;s series, mostly in the introduction
part. Which is why some scenes deeply remind of the Ocean&#x27;s series.
Nolan used this perfect idea for marketing the movie. But actually, as
the story moves forward it stats to gain it&#x27;s originality and unique
concepts.<br /><br />What make Inception so unique is it&#x27;s storytelling techniques, though
sometime confusing, with many twists and turns, mix of several special
effects and it&#x27;s thrilling background score. Background score keeps the
viewers constantly stare at the screen, and to the edge of the seat.
Many disasters and action scenes were represented perfectly with rich
graphical interfaces. Locations and aesthetic environments in several
parts of the story with twists also need appreciation.<br /><br />Not everybody will understand the main concept of Inception unless they
curiously focus and concentrate on the happenings. What you can never
miss in Inception are it&#x27;s rich graphical effects and serious roles of
all the actors. They all deserve adequate attention.<br /><br />Nolan is perfect in his casting as always, and Caprio fits the bill as
the protagonist of Inception. Caprio understands well which role suits
him, and selects the movie accordingly. His facial expressions and body
languages with the character and the story are simply amazing, and
always to the peak. He has returned to the audiences who can remember
him forever. Joseph Gordon-Levitt too has a meaty role which justifies
the main story and cannot be ignored. He is nonetheless than Caprio in
terms of performance. But unlike in Nolan&#x27;s Batman series, Michael
Caine is limited to offer here for very short duration, but still in
prominence. No idea why his role was not expanded so that we could
watch more of his versatile performance.<br /><br />With Inception, Nolan proved that he has his own ways of creating a
story, then forming it into a smooth directorial venture. Finally
bringing out the finished movie product to the audiences. He can also
enter inside their psychological state and win their applause and
rewards. After Memento, Inception would certainly remain as a landmark
in Hollywood as an all time psychological and sci-fiction thriller.<br /><br />NEVER MISS IT...!!!!
