With expectations so high for Christopher Nolan after a movies like
&#x27;Memento&#x27;, &#x27;Batman Begins&#x27; and &#x27;Dark Knight&#x27;; it is undoubtedly one of
the best ever made in the history of film making. Just when Dark Knight
made you feel that this is the best any movie can ever get, Nolan
raises the bar even higher and gives &#x22;INCEPTION&#x22; to the world. He not
only surpasses his own personal best but also the likes of the movies
like &#x27;Avatar&#x27; which has huge gained audience in recent times. The sheer
perfection of this movie has blown the world away. <br /><br />&#x22;What&#x27;s the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the
human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and
rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it.&#x22;<br /><br />Never in the past has any movie combined visual effects and
intelligence in such excellently directed action scenes combined with
visual effects that can make your jaw drop with a high but perfectly
balanced shot of intelligence and imagination. In the past we have
witnessed many unidirectional movies have shown grace only in visual
effects (&#x27;Transformers&#x27; etc) or story (&#x27;Blind Side&#x27;, &#x27;Up In the Air&#x27;)
but no director has ever achieved the perfect mixture like Nolan did.
Despite containing so much in the movie (action, drama, intelligence,
thrill, maths, physics etc), it was smooth like a Symphony. Nolan
prepared this with so much precision that you won&#x27;t find any abrupt
transition between action sequences and visual effects. This genius
director has the ability to present his vision in such graceful manner
demonstrating his powerful skills. He takes movie making to a whole new
dimension ! His imaginative thoughts and increasing desire for
perfection is making the world hungry for more. He defines Perfection!<br /><br />Inception has so much material and at the right pace to keep you at the
edge of the seat for the entire duration of this masterpiece. Some
scenes can even throw you off the seat. It will grip your attention
like a strong magnet to a nail leaving you helpless but to watch and
keep wondering of what will sweep you away next. One can&#x27;t stop feeling
gratitude for life to be honored by this movie. When it ends, you are
bound to plan the next watch just for relishing the great work. <br /><br />Leo, my boy, was as the world knows him, One of the best actors to have
lived in this era. And it is his aura that provokes the people around
him to starve for achieving higher. Although his performance was better
in &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; but he still was the best of the lot. After all it
is he who sets high standards for the viewers to expect. A great
balance between emotions has always been his key strengths. Over the
years he has perfected his acting making him the ideal cast for a high
profile movie like Inception. In fact, all the star cast was great.
Ellen has evolved into a fine actress to join the league of Michael
Caine, Joseph Gordon, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard and
Ken Watanabe.<br /><br />The sets and locations used in the movies are splendid. To be shot in 6
countries and such expensive sets is an achievement in itself. Combined
with an Original, complex and imaginative script gives you an idea of
the wonders Nolan is capable of doing when he is in the drivers seat.
Its like he can talk to cameras placing them at correct locations and
being able to shoot such striking shots proves his exemplary skills.
The music is so good that it complements every aspect of the movie
making it such a pleasure to watch. Hans Zimmer has indeed done a great
job. His vivid ideas of venturing into the human mind has never been
attempted in such a profound way. I can&#x27;t help but wonder the kind of
genius involved in coming up with a concept. The visual effects and
action sequences are original and new which is something we have been
missing for a long time. It is in fact so different that I won&#x27;t be
surprised if a book is written from this epic. Nolan surpasses the
likes of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron becoming probably the most
gifted directors in Hollywood history. <br /><br />I read someone&#x27;s comment somewhere which stated that, &#x22;If Nolan doesn&#x27;t
get an Oscar for best direction then there is something seriously wrong
with the awards&#x22; and I totally agree with this. It is just a matter of
time that Oxford and Cambridge realize the necessity to add a new word
to their dictionary. One which represents as a synonym to perfection
and the ability to sweep people of their feet by one&#x27;s genius. Maybe
then it will make sense when I say, &#x22;I am one of the millions who has
been NOLAN&#x27;ed !!!&#x22;
