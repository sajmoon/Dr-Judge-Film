What on earth has happened to character development in cinema? I was
pretty pumped to see Inception. It looked flashy, decent actors, and
what appeared to actually be a new idea for a plot (I&#x27;m REAL tired of
rehashed plots).<br /><br />You were thrown into the film with characters that had NO basis of who
they were. I didn&#x27;t have a chance to decide if I liked a character
through who they were. Lead actor played his usual flat self. He
reminds me of the Al Pacino school of acting graduate. I didn&#x27;t care
anything about him or his &#x22;team&#x22;.<br /><br />There were so stinkin&#x27; many visual flaws, goofs, and editing mistakes I
lost count of which ones I would start with after the movie.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is that I had a free pass given to me
by my boss!
