Nothing more to say. Really got to see it again, and probably again,
and must sure, again... It&#x27;s so intense, so marking. DiCaprio is
excellent. Nolan is fabulous. I thought, from the reviews I&#x27;ve read
before seen the movie that, well, let&#x27;s see if The Great One it is The
Great One.<br /><br />One thing that i&#x27;m really sure tonight, after watching Inception: IT IS
THE ONE, AND IT IS GREAT! The argument it&#x27;s so very complex in a way to
put you into the screen. Remarkable sets/landscapes/constructions,
digital or real. Powerful soundtrack and a powerful sound. The ending
it&#x27;s fabulous.<br /><br />Resuming: It&#x27;s a Perfect Movie.
