If Avatar raised the bar high with its stupendous technical
accomplishment, then Inception has set the bar even higher with its
technical brilliance intertwined with a story that keeps you riveted to
your seats till the end. Where Avatar missed out with its otherwise
bland storyline, Inception has delivered and how! &#x27;&#x27;An idea can
transform the world&#x27;&#x27; - the perfectionist Christopher Nolan&#x27;s unique
idea about dreams materialized into Inception and has transformed the
very notion of a &#x27;movie&#x27;. Nolan, who leaves no stone unturned in
hunting out the perfect actors in his films does not make an exception
here. Known for bringing out the most engrossing performances from his
cast, the vintage Nolan has once again succeeded in making his actors
give such effortless executions of their roles thus orchestrating into
one of the most intriguing movies ever made.<br /><br />True to Nolan style, Inception keeps you guessing with its thrills and
spins, the delicate intricacies that make perfect use of your mind and
the engaging visuals that never leave even a single minute boring. One
of the most original scripts written by Nolan with fantastic dialogues,
the mind-boggling multi-layered film simply entices you with its
breathtaking cinematography and superb special effects.<br /><br />You can feel yourself sharing the dreams of the extractors as Dom Cobb,
the master extractor goes on stealing ideas from the human mind by
sharing dreams. You can feel his emotions as his belief torments his
soul and Ariadne&#x27;s anxiety that his personal pain might actually bring
about the downfall of their entire mission. If the movie&#x27;s first half
enchants you with its charm then the second half simply blows your
mind. For the first half is the basic lead-up to the actual process of
inception shown in the second half, which Dom Cobb takes up as a
challenge which would aid him to return to his children.<br /><br />And there lies the multi-layered dream fantasy, a dream within a dream
- something you have never seen before. And each layer is executed with
such impeccability and intelligence that you cannot help taking your
eye off the screen for even a single second.<br /><br />And to top it all Hans Zimmer&#x27;s association with the movie brings out
the best in every scene with his brilliant score.<br /><br />Over the years Leonardo Di Caprio has grown even better as an actor and
his latest offering of Cobb, the corporate spy with a tortured mind
might finally be enough for an Oscar breakthrough. Ellen Page as the
prodigious architect, Ariadne and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb&#x27;s team
member, Arthur deliver impressive performances. Ken Watanabe&#x27;s
portrayal of a cunning businessman was absolutely just what the movie
required. Tom Hardy as the witty forger, Eames and Cilian Murphy as the
heir, Fischer Jr with hidden emotions do a commendable job. Last but
not the least, Marion Cotillard was haunting and bewitching in her
small role as Cobb&#x27;s deceased wife, Mal who appears in his
subconscious.<br /><br />This is by far Nolan&#x27;s best offering till date. While a single viewing
might not be enough to grasp the film entirely, its grandeur will
simply mesmerize the audience and cover up any flaw, if it really has
any. If Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight raised the bar of
expectations, then Nolan has simply exceeded those expectations with
Inception and makes himself an absolutely compelling candidate for the
Academy Awards!
