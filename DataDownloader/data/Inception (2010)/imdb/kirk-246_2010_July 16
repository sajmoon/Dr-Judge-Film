I knew I was going to like &#x22;Inception&#x22; from the start when I watched
the trailers and TV spots.When I read the plot online, i was even more
excited because I new more about it.And here I am, reviewing one of the
best movies of not only the Summer, but of 2010.Christopher Nolan is a
master storyteller who knows how to give us a captivating plot and mix
it with fascinating special effects and believable characters.It&#x27;s no
surprise that the performances are great.Leonardo DiCaprio was the
right choice for his role, as he is with his other movies.It&#x27;s not just
him that brings the movie to life.Ellen Page (Juno) is very good here
and Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) gives another mature and powerful
performance.I don&#x27;t think I could think about one feature about this
movie that&#x27;s not as good as the others.Every minute of this 148 minute
thrill ride is absolutely dazzling.Oh, and there&#x27;s the action
sequences.What&#x27;s great about them is that they don&#x27;t go over the top
like Transformers or Shoot Em up.They&#x27;re not only realistic and
convincing, but also exciting and even thrilling at times, and that&#x27;s
rare for a smart action thriller.There you have it, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is here
and the hype that&#x27;s been going about is certainly worth it.As I
mentioned before, It&#x27;s probably the best movie of the Summer and one of
the best pictures of 2010.Move over Dark Knight, there&#x27;s another summer
blockbuster in town, and it&#x27;s pretty damn spectacular.
