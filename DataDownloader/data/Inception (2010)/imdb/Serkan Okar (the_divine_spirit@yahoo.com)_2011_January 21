Let me start by saying that Inception is not a movie for all audience.
If you are familiar with director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s style and vision,
you know what I am talking about. And if you don&#x27;t know what I am
talking about, you should probably stay away from Inception.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movies are quite complex, multi-layered, story-
within-story type of movies (remember Memento?). You will probably have
to watch it a few times to put it altogether and even then you may not
be able to solve everything as some things are still left to viewer&#x27;s
interpretation. If you are looking for a movie which will make total
sense, stay away.<br /><br />You must believe the logic of the movie: there is a device that enables
a person to enter the mind of another person while he is dreaming. The
purpose of this is basically to intercept the creation process of the
mind that occurs during dream state and steal ideas from subconscious.
When the mind is in a dream state, it continues to create and at the
same time observes what it creates. These two processes happen
concurrently, we don&#x27;t even notice. The movie also introduces the idea
of planting an idea in someone&#x27;s mind, a process called inception.<br /><br />Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) accepts the mission to do an inception in the
hopes that he can return to USA to his children, puts together a team
of experts and plans the heist. The rest is a lot of action sequences
that go deeper and deeper into subconscious.<br /><br />I think Inception is a very well-crafted movie, action scenes are
amazing, especially the upside-down fight scene in the hall. I also
like the editing, sound editing and sound mixing. Even though the
concept is not totally original, the screenplay and its execution is
quite stylish and unique. Most people criticize this movie being too
similar to The Matrix but I disagree. Entering another realm which
looks like reality and being bound by the rules of that realm are
probably the only common trait both movies share. Inception sets itself
apart from the Matrix with its unique style, and totally different
plot.
