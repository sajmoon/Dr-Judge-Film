2010_July 16 
I walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film,
and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the
moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial
questions are simply because those trailers we&#x27;ve been watching all
year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us
just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo
DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions
grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate
the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It&#x27;s an absolute ride, and in
IMAX, it&#x27;s astounding.<br /><br />It&#x27;s easy to see how this is the product of Nolan&#x27;s work in Memento. It
deals with the same issues of our narrator&#x27;s reliability and questions
of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that
seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you&#x27;ll
wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true
is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and
characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan,
is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its
medium and pulls you in. I&#x27;d almost say it breaks the fourth wall
without even trying to.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the special effects are one of the
highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time,
but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, &#x22;It&#x27;s only when you wake up
that you realize there was something strange.&#x22; This strangeness is
embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite
staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are
not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to
symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox
of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours
after you finish watching.<br /><br />The performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the
characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed.
Don&#x27;t be alarmed though. Nolan hasn&#x27;t lost the touch that created his
Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this
lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will
begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo
DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative
center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they
are, these roles are played beautifully. It&#x27;s as if they don&#x27;t even
realize they&#x27;re the ones we&#x27;re all focused on. <br /><br />I would&#x27;ve given this a 10/10 if it weren&#x27;t for the excessive use of
Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music. I&#x27;m a major fan of Zimmer&#x27;s work, but I believe
music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some
sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score,
it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no
difference in my emotional response. That&#x27;s my only complaint, but I&#x27;m
a film score nerd so don&#x27;t worry about it.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It&#x27;s a
privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working
today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You&#x27;ll leave the
theater feeling as if you just &#x22;witnessed&#x22; something.
