I just recently saw this film, and to say the least I am impressed.
Christopher Nolan has done what many people can&#x27;t seem to do these
days, which is to come up with an original idea and make it a great
film. If you can make it through a movie while being slightly confused,
this is a movie for you. It is full of action, science fiction, and
mind boggling storyline. It is a great film and a must see! Leonardo De
Caprio rocked his performance, along with Jason Gordon Levitt and Ellen
page. This movie also has humor in it, which is unexpected, but put in
very good timing. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself, and makes The
Dark Knight look amateurish. So get in line, buy the ticket, and watch
this movie as many times as you can. IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!
