Wow! Another super overrated movie from the guy who brought us the Dark
Knight. And of course its totally overrated. After watching like 5
minutes you can tell this movie is going to awfully boring. The story
may be interesting and the effects up to date but the movie is still
not worth a watch. How can this have so many good reviews and an
average rating of 9,1?? Were we watching the same movie? Leonardo di
Caprio playing himself as usual, Christopher Nolan directing like
somebody with an IQ of 2 and the rest is Hollywood plastic. So whoever
has some brain in his head should be wondering how someone can possible
enjoy such a boring movie.
