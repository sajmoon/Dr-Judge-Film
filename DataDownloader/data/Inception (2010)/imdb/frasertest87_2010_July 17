This is the kind of film we are meant to see in theaters.<br /><br />The screen writing flows elegantly however I do wish they had not said
&#x22;it&#x27;s impossible&#x22; as many times as they did in the beginning however it
was likely to be sarcasm. the acting was, well, i&#x27;ve grown up with the
careers of many of these actors and its films like Inception that I
know people will be looking back on when these people are receiving
lifetime achievement awards. they did an outstanding job. the story
line is superb with thought provoking concepts and metaphysical
constructs I haven&#x27;t seen since movies like &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; and &#x22;What
Dreams May Come&#x22;. The directing is spot on. No wasted time, no wasted
shots, it flows and your never bored. It is a work of art. Go see it in
theaters. IMAX does it justice however it is not necessary. the scenery
and mind bending shots are amazing but no better than in any normal
theater.<br /><br />See it, you won&#x27;t regret it.
