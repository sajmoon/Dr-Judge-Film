2011_January 8 
From the suggestion of this film and numerous ads on TV during the
films release I had the idea it might follow through with some of
DiCaprio&#x27;s better choices of scripts in recent years.<br /><br />Unfortunately after a long wait for the DVD release in my local rental
kiosk, the rental became available a month after the commercial
release.<br /><br />Sadly Inception was barely worth the dollar rental.<br /><br />Alluring special effects don&#x27;t help the fact a confusing intellectual
premise eventually degrades into a standard machine gun shoot em up.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
