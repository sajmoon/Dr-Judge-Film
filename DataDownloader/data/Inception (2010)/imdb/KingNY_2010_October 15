Christopher Nolan has yet again out done himself with a mind blowing
storyline and his nonparallel directing skills. After writing and
directing a mega blockbuster, The Dark Knight, Nolan has created a
super mega blockbuster, Inception. He has yet again created a different
level in story writing and film making and he has reached new heights
which no one has.<br /><br />The movie is absolutely visually stunning - god like cinematography,
heart pounding - non stop pace, out of this world storyline and amazing
acting - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page &#x26; Joseph Gorden-Levitt. This
movie will keep you guessing until the very end and there is not a
single second where you want to look away from this movie.<br /><br />Nolan is not the only one who has reached new heights with this film
but also Leonardo DiCaprio. Caprio has been vintage in this movie and
his performance was beyond outstanding. Nonetheless, Ellen Page and
Joseph Gorden-Levitt have also performed extremely well in their
respective roles. There is no doubt Inception is going to bag good
amount of Oscars - Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Actress,
Cinematography, Screenplay, Visual Effects and probably Film Editing.<br /><br />Nolan has yet to write and direct a film that is below hit level.
Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now
Inception. After watching Inception, I can&#x27;t wait to see what he will
have stored in his next movie, which he just announced, Batman 3.
Batman 3 will be releasing in 2012. I know its a long time to wait but
when it comes to Nolan its worth it.
