This movie is perfection.<br /><br />From the beginning until the very end, this movie grips you and the
entire audience completely. It is honestly a crime that certain people
think this is a bad movie. There is not one bad part in the entire
thing.<br /><br />I saw it 3 days ago and I am still mesmerized by it. People should be
regarding this work as one of the rarest forms of art we have left,
because beyond just the movie itself, the fact that it was able to be
made the way it was is an incredible feat in itself. <br /><br />It is nearly impossible to see a studio these days give a director free
reign on the entire movie and script when the film costs as much as it
does to make. We have the honor and the privilege as an audience to be
able to watch one of the most creative stories come to life in the most
fantastical way that it epitomizes why humans go to the movies.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and in no way should be discarded by any means
because it is considered a &#x22;summer blockbuster.&#x22; This is the rarest
summer blockbuster you will ever see and for that matter the rarest and
most incredible movie I have seen in at least the past 5 years.
