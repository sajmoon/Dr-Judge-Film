I know many people have already given their comments on Inception, but
after viewing this astounding film for myself, i just couldn&#x27;t resist.<br /><br />I went into Inception with incredibly high expectations, and i wasn&#x27;t
disappointed, not only did this film meet all my expectations, but it
surpassed them with absolute ease.<br /><br />One of the reasons i found this movie so incredible, was the excellent
special effects used, it was all very realistic and their was not one
point during the film where it was obvious special effects were used,
it makes you believe that you are their experiencing it for yourself.<br /><br />Another reason i found this movie incredible was because of the
formidable acting performances by the entire cast, especially by
Leonardo Di Caprio and Ellen Page. you could really feel the emotion
coming from the actors/actresses, and it was very realistic, the entire
cast seemed to really gel together.<br /><br />The main the reason Inception was incredible, was the sheer brilliance
from of the story and directing, the whole idea of questioning reality
and dreams, was pure genius, the ideas were relatively similar to the
ones on The Matrix, but it was done in its own original way. I think
Christopher Nolan (Writer, producer and director) showed incredible
talent and imagination to create a masterpiece like this, and it
managed to inspire me to write a review (only one other film has done
that to me before and that was The Matrix) I&#x27;m not going to spoil the
final scene, but i am going to say, the final scene with the music it
had, gave me goosebumps, and left the audience completely stunned!<br /><br />In conclusion....BELIEVE THE HYPE AND GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
