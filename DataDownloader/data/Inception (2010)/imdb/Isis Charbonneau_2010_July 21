Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight. Absolutely
fantastic movies (despite Memento&#x27;s overlook in many cases). <br /><br />Christopher Nolan manages to deliver the same twisting adventure
present in his previous movies in Inception. This movie, however, takes
things to a whole new level. Inception is monumental. It is the epitome
of cinematic creativity and revels in epic storytelling.<br /><br />Be warned: this movie is not for the middle school (or in most cases
even high school) movie goer looking for cheap laughs, low budget blow
up scenes, corny nudity or a dark theater to make out in.<br /><br />This movie REQUIRES thinking; it REQUIRES attention.<br /><br />When you dedicate yourself to its mastery, it can change your
perceptions about life in a very big way.<br /><br />I would liken this movie to a sort of combination between Shutter
Island, Memento and the Matrix. <br /><br />The cinematic elements are excellent, the music is inspiring and
beautiful, the scenes are flawlessly directed, the actors are
phenomenal, the writing is on point without unnecessary fluff, the plot
is complicated but inspired, the movie flows with grace, and while some
moments can be a bit slow, it&#x27;s for a reason.<br /><br />The plot is very much about layers of action and detail. I would
recommend getting your treats and bathroom breaks done ahead of time-
if you miss a few minutes, trust me, those minutes are important, and
you&#x27;ll miss something.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give anything away, because the movie should really
unfold before you (that&#x27;s what creates it&#x27;s power). Besides, you can
read the synopsis up top by the title information.<br /><br />But I will say this:<br /><br />This movie could win an Oscar and change Hollywood. Period.
