Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF
HITCHCOCK&#x27;S FILMS.The problem and it isn&#x27;t about rating movies only
,but let&#x27;s say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or
which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the
majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write
reviews ,haven&#x27;t seen great people in their lifetime and can&#x27;t
comprehend what their real value was.It&#x27;s different to listen from
other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they
were in their prime.It&#x27;s different to listen from other people about
the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they
performed in the 60&#x27;s.So OK,i won&#x27;t be surprised if Justin Bieber on an
online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are
70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED
results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this
&#x22;masterpiece&#x22; might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not
thousands).I think it&#x27;s the only film ,that IMDb shouldn&#x27;t care about
spoilers,because you can&#x27;t spoil a storyline that doesn&#x27;t exist.
Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they
succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have
watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from
kilometers away the &#x22;potatoes&#x22;(a phrase that means really really bad
films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the
power to save my self from the next Inception.
