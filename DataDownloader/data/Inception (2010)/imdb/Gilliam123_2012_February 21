If you haven&#x27;t seen this film and unsure about the fact it is very
hyped, rent it from blockbuster. The first thing to notice about this
film is it a very clever and ambitious film. While the cast is an
ensemble of well known American, English, Indian and Japanese actors,
the backstage is led by Christopher Nolan who is credited as the
director, writer and producer of this film. The cast includes Leonardo
DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Tom Hardy.
Big-time extractor Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) and his assistant Arthur
(Gordon-Levitt) are offered a job by Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) to slow
down the evolution of a business empire. While the planning of how they
are going to do an &#x27;inception&#x27; is very interesting, it is the Inception
itself which is the highlight of the film. Tom Hardy is an impersonator
and friend of Cobb&#x27;s who helps Cobb with the Inception, and Ellen Page
is a student who Cobb approaches to be the architect of the dream. But
Cobb&#x27;s job is threatened by dream projections of his wife, Mal (Marion
Cotillard. Michael Caine, a recurring collaborator of Nolan, makes a
cameo appearance as Ellen Page&#x27;s teacher Professor Miles.
