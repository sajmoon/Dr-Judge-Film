What a load of rubbish, you gotta love the way everyone gets real
excited about a film that doesn&#x27;t make any sense, hey, i don&#x27;t get it,
oh, so it must be an intelligent movie! People, movies are not
intelligent, they are there for entertainment, and this one was just
plain stupid, basically tripping over itself trying to be cleverer then
it was supposed to be. Any intelligent human being who stops and thinks
about it for 2 minutes will realise that it doesn&#x27;t make sense at the
beginning, nor at the end, and all the thickoes like that! because if
it doesn&#x27;t make sense to them, then it must be clever, no guys! give
yourselves more credit then that, it&#x27;s a load of rubbish!
