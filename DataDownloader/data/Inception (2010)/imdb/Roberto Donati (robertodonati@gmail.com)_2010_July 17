Are you kidding me? All this fawning? Just because you don&#x27;t understand
it does NOT mean it&#x27;s genius. I took my two friends to the packed
screening and in the middle of it we all looked at each other truly
baffled. Is THIS what all the buzz was about? Overwrought, longgg,
confusing and as much as I love Ken Watanabe could you have at least
done a take or two where you could actually understand him? Yes, there
are a few positives to this thing (Leo is almost always great, and
Ellen Page is refreshingly for once not doing her &#x22;Hard Candy&#x22; role)
but gawwwwd Chris Nolan is on his truly on his way to becoming the next
Shyamalamadingdong. Somebody please tell him to tone it down and focus.
