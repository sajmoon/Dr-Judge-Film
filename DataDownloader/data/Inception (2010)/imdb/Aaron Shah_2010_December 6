Repost of my Amazon.com &#x22;Inception&#x22; review for IMDb:<br /><br />While this film has many great aspects to it: The acting, special
effects and a compelling topic; I couldn&#x27;t help but feel overall
disappointed with this film. <br /><br />Despite the abundant action packed sequences, &#x22;Inception&#x22; left me
bored. This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to
nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but
nameless faceless &#x22;white blood cells&#x22; defending the subconscious. It
just felt like it dragged on forever. That along with the fact that I
felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly
ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile. Not to
mention, the film felt very jumpy. As in it jumps from scene to scene
to scene every few minutes. In fact, the film may have been trying to
pull off a feat so grand, that it leaves you thinking its all just a
big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following. I can deal
with a complex film, but I feel that the jumping around to all the
scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus. In other
words, I watched the movie play out, but it did not pull me into it. I
was a detached viewer, no emotional involvement whatsoever. On top of
that, the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the
revelation department. You could always see the tracks before the train
went over them so to speak. One aspect of the movie that just
completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both
imaginative, yet uncreative at the same time. There is so much
potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming, but this film
decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual
dreams. <br /><br />However, the biggest disappointed of this movie is the fact that
everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film. This film
has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind. It feels
overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical
debate. After watching &#x22;Inception&#x22; it did not have me contemplating the
big questions in life one bit. When it ended, it ended, and that was
that. <br /><br />In the end, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not an intellectual deep thinking exercise,
it is an average action film masquerading as one.<br /><br />Addendum: The fact that this film has reached such a high ranking here
on IMDb I think proves my fears about modern society. We are becoming
overall less and less capable of creative and critical thought.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; leaves absolutely nothing up to the imagination. It is
complex, anally neat and almost mathematically in precision. Society
these days seems to like everything spoon fed to them. In other words,
as long as it doesn&#x27;t require too much independent thinking and
contemplation, it&#x27;s a candidate for best movie ever. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a fine action film that is smoothly and
methodically executed, but if your like me and require something with
deeper meaning, emotional involvement and room to have thoughts of your
own, &#x22;Inception&#x22; will leave you disappointed.
