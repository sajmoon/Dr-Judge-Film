This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most
miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the
most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the
beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with
your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book
&#x22;The Power of Movies&#x22;, in which he discusses the spatio-temporal
discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then
leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan
treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he&#x27;s discovered something.
What he&#x27;s lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams,
the tremendous emotional wallop. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is so detailed, so
measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the
imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with
carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all
kind...it&#x27;s anti-dreaming. I&#x27;ve never watched a film so awake, so aware
of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural
historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big
Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually
empty films like this (and &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22;) as good examples of what
ruined the country. Wretched excess.
