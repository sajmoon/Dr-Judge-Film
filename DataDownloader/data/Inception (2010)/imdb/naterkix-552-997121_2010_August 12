An intriguing story that, even after multiple viewings, people WILL see
the ending in different ways. People sometimes don&#x27;t like ambiguous
endings and I can understand why. It&#x27;s nice to know exactly how things
ended for everyone. A movie like Inception is a good on to go to (or
watch if you&#x27;re reading this after the BluRay/DVD is out) before you
eat lunch or dinner with the people who saw it with you. You have all
the table talk you&#x27;ll need.<br /><br />The movie itself is well written, acted, special effect...ed and is a
blast to watch. It&#x27;s hard to say much without spoilers so just do
yourself a favor and go see a thoroughly thoughtful movie that isn&#x27;t
boring or preachy.
