*** This review may contain spoilers *** <br /><br />May be I expected too much from this movie, which was supposed to
&#x22;change the way I see things&#x22;. Well, it did not change anything, and
certainly not the way I look at things. May be it changed the way I
look at people who think this is the best movie ever made.<br /><br />It&#x27;s long, tedious, they go through layers after layers, why, we do not
really know. The characters are numerous, flat, (some may argue that
this is a dream so they are supposed to be flat), but strangely enough
they are quite consistent, they never change, which is not consistent
at least with my dreams.<br /><br />And if you ask people why this movie is so fascinating and &#x22;complex&#x22;,
you might end up with the following conversation: <br /><br />&#x22;it can not be explained with words, it&#x27;s a story about a guy who
gather a team to go through different layer of dreams to alter, blah.&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;Yes, I got that and?&#x22;<br /><br />&#x22;But I can&#x27;t tell you the whole plot, I might spoil it&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;I saw it, try me.&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;Euh, his wife blah blah... about the dream thing, life, death,
redemption, there are so many themes in this movie&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;And?&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;Euh, I don&#x27;t know, you need to think.&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;Ah...&#x22;<br /><br />I guess many people confuse complexity and redundancy. These guys just
go through layers and layers of dreams, wrapped non-sense
pseudo-scientific verbiage. Than he sees his wife again and again, and
&#x22;kicks&#x22; back again and again, fights again bad guys again and again.
And what? This is not complex, this is redundant and boring!<br /><br />Many people mentioned to me that there was a trick at the end of the
movie... Actually, the end is a kind of pale copy of Orange Clockwork
ending, and you can expect the trick from the beginning. Orange
clockwork, the hurt locker, usual suspect, this is how you end a movie,
and I did not see it coming from the first 15 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />In the category &#x22;the director tries to drive you crazy&#x22;, Donnie Darko,
Mulholland drive and, if we stick to Nolan universe, Memento gets my
vote, not Inception. Or go watch Matrix again, or Dark city, or
whatever movie you want to, that lasts less than 2 hours.<br /><br />Bottom line, I was bored during the projection, and that&#x27;s one of the
worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. 2 points because I did not leave (which
makes it a better movie than Titanic to me).
