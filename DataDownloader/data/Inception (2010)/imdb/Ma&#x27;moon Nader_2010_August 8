Words like &#x22;Brilliant&#x22;, &#x22;Original&#x22;, &#x22;Breathtaking&#x22; or even &#x22;Master
piece&#x22; aren&#x27;t enough to what was created from the new God of the 21st
century of cinema, Christopher Nolan, and I can&#x27;t truly find a suitable
word to describe &#x22;Inception&#x22; to make you go out right now and watch it
, because not watching this movie is not a must, it&#x27;s a crime.<br /><br />In Inception, Where dreams meet realities and Illusions start forming
to something we never encountered before, Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an
extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons
and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with
practiced skill, though he&#x27;s always haunted by the memory of his late
wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a rapid habit of showing up in
his subconscious and havocking his missions. But then, the journey
begins when the wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over
the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival
Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to
steal the idea but to plant a new one: &#x27;Inception&#x27; And this is where
the ultimate excitement begins. , Cobb&#x27;s specialists team up with him
To carry out the task, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime
organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a &#x22;forger&#x22; who can shape shift at will;
and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful chemicals supplier.<br /><br />Cinematography combined with visual effects created a new experience in
the action scenes where you start &#x22;losing gravity&#x22; and you realize that
you aren&#x27;t just watching the scenes, you are feeling them to find
yourself pulled inside the screen to enter a new dimension of nested
dreams where your head will start literally aching you. As for the
music, Hans Zimmer&#x27;s compositions were made to start haunting you
electrically during the whole movie to take you off the edge of your
seat. And finally the plot, It was purely original, where every scene
with every line makes you question yourself more and more about the
real explanation for what you are watching (especially during the last
hour) where layers start interfering and dreams start crashing with
realities to leave you suspended in a dark void at the end of the movie
without reaching a clear conclusion for what you watched, Nolan did
that on purpose I can tell.<br /><br />At the end, I&#x27;d like to point that I&#x27;m one of the most people who hates
those movies gushing fans who start nagging me about every single movie
he/she watched talking about it as &#x22;Perfect&#x22; or &#x22;Super freaking
awesome&#x22; even if it&#x27;s a piece of scum, because simply they can&#x27;t
control themselves to be in a neutral state when they watch any movie
so that they can give it a satisfying review, But in &#x22;Inception&#x22;, I
couldn&#x27;t find anything to criticize on, is it because my gushing
feelings started erupting in my mind and heart during the movie or
because simply it was just perfect, whatever the answer was, I can tell
that Christopher Nolan eventually succeed in creating something that
paralyzes us from criticizing negatively about.
