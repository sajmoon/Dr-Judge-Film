Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, The Prestige) is a genius. There&#x27;s
no two ways about it. He is an absolute cinematic genius. He has been
on a streak of fantastic films since Memento (2000). Each of his films
breaks new boundaries and excels in creativity and incredible
originality in every aspect. Inception is no different. In fact, it may
be Mr. Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece.<br /><br />From the beginning Nolan introduces us to his highly advanced and
detailed world of dreams. An elaborate and specific set of rules is set
in place for what can and cannot safely be done in another person&#x27;s
dreams. The entire concept explores new dimensions of the human mind
never magnified quite like this. This film requires that you pay close
attention or you will get lost in the many layers of intricacy woven
into this bizarre and existential dream scape.<br /><br />Not only are the concepts and ideas behind the movie absolutely genius,
but they are executed amazingly well. Inception follows a team of
international criminals who steal valuable information via the
subconscious. From the opening scenes that introduce us to the
characters and their minds, a deep and multilayerd plot unfolds that
keeps you guessing at all times and is rich with emotion and thought
provoking development. A strong cast holds together the extraneous and
mind blowing plot, allowing anyone to enjoy the film. This is Nolan&#x27;s
strong-suit: his ability to appeal to the masses, while not dumbing
down his plot. He has most definitely established himself as one of
Hollywood&#x27;s best.<br /><br />Between a strong cast of characters, a beautifully crafted plot line,
and Nolan&#x27;s always superb directing ability, I&#x27;m almost certain
Inception will be the summer&#x27;s best film.
