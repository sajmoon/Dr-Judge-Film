2010_August 7 
I had great expectations of this movie, but it turned out to be a
little disappointing to me. I love the sci-fi and fantasy genre, but I
was not very impressed with this movie, although I&#x27;ve seen it in IMAX
with 12.000 Watts of sound around me. On my own, with no one to
distract me.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio acted well, but his character made no impression on
me at all. Distracted by the complex story line (took me quite a lot of
concentration to keep up) the pain of losing his wife could not be felt
by me. I must mention I was very impressed by his acting in Shutter
Island, maybe because there was more room in that movie&#x27;s script to
develop something special. The other actors also did well, but I&#x27;ve
already almost forgotten their faces and roles. I found the clever
architect girl (Ellen Page) a little uninspiring and therefore
replaceable.<br /><br />For me the story line was too complex to sit back and enjoy. Nolan
pulled his &#x22;Dream&#x22; idea in the direction of a &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; like action
movie. I was hoping for more mystery and sometimes a slower pace to
build up tension and to give the actors enough room to really develop
into something to remember.<br /><br />The quality (recorded on 65mm film), the special effects and the
cinematography are flawless. Just very very good. The scene where Paris
folds above your head is incredible.<br /><br />Well, I&#x27;m really sorry to be one of the first to be a little less
enthusiastic about this movie. but a #3 ranking (currently 9.2) in the
Top 250 list of best films of all times, seems to me like a joke.<br /><br />Just go and see it for yourself. You won&#x27;t get bored, but will you
still remember this movie after a couple of weeks?.....
