Expected more from &#x22;Inception&#x22;. It&#x27;s not bad, but I didn&#x27;t like it that
much either. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m kind of slow :) ,but I thought the
movie tried to be &#x22;complex&#x22; and the story actually got too confusing.
Also too much James Bondean type of action for my taste. The main idea
behind the film is great though, I&#x27;m sure it could have been much
better. Maybe too much concern for special effects and couch potato
type of entertainment. OK, Leonardo Di Caprio is a good actor, the
movie innovates in some aspects. And It does make you think about the
nature of dreams and so on, but not much more. Most of the time you&#x27;re
just trying to figure out what&#x27;s happening and seeing explosions.
