2010_July 19 
Having seen the trailers for the past several weeks I was planning to
see it but I was certainly not excited about it. The next 2 1/2 hours
flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and
challenged the mind like a small &#x22;indie&#x22; flick. As I tried to figure
out exactly what happened (which of course will be my opinion since
this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of
interpretations) I realized I needed to give it another look so I went
back the next day and watched it again. I noticed a few slight &#x22;flaws&#x22;
the second time through but these were small details that can be
rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie
really was about. Is this a all a dream? Is it real and everything went
as planned? Are portions real and the end a dream? There will be
countless debate on this and we know Mr. Nolan will never tell. What I
do know after this and the sensational &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22; I am now in the
&#x22;Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film
industry&#x22; camp. I strongly recommend to everyone - go see this and form
your own conclusions - this movie does not preach, but just entertains
and challenges. The best movie in years - nothing has been close!
