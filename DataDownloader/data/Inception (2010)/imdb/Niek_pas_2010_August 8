I went into this movie expecting a masterpiece, as both Memento and
Batman Begins are brilliantly crafted films that require you to pay
attention and really get into the movie. Sadly, The Dark Knight was far
more summer blockbuster-ish, and didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations, so
I was hoping Nolan would go back to the style of his earlier movies.
Sadly, he didn&#x27;t. This movie was not confusing, at all. You barely had
to think. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people saying &#x22;it leaves you questioning
reality.&#x22; I disagree. There were redeeming factors though: the acting
was superb, the CGI was really good and it had a good flow, so it
didn&#x27;t seem like 2 hours and 15 minutes. It was a good movie, but I had
expected Nolan to do better.
