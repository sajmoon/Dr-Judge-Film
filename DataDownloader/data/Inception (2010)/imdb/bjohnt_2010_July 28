What can I, or anyone, say about this film? Nothing. It is damn near
impossible to explain this movie. Which is why it is a must-see for any
movie goer. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan beautifully weaves this complicated tale of dream
extractors forced to delve into the unknown depths of peoples dreams to
find important information. Nolan chooses to throw the narrative
structure into a blender, and at times you feel lost, but that&#x27;s the
point. He successfully brings you into the middle of these characters
dreams, making you feel disoriented yet mystified.<br /><br />The only gripe is the character development, for some of the
characters. Of course, Leonardo DiCaprio is great as the protagonist,
but I feel some characters were just left out in the cold. for example,
Joseph Gordon Levitt&#x27;s character, the &#x22;point man&#x22; really lacks any real
emotion or purpose. This isn&#x27;t the actors fault, it&#x27;s the writing.<br /><br />But all in all, it&#x27;s a film no one should miss out on. I see this as a
film people will look back on in the future. And it could very well
define this generation. This is a love letter to cinema, saying
&#x22;through all these remakes and reboots, there are people that can still
make great films.&#x22;
