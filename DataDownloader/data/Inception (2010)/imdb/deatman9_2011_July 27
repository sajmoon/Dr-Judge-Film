When I first heard of this movie I could not wait to see it. I heard
nothing but good reviews and it had Leo dicaprio which im am a huge
fan. It was directed by christoper nolan the man who brought us the
dark knight (another one of my favorites) so I watched this with very
high expectations and sadly they were not met.<br /><br />This movie is set in the near future where it is actullay possible to
enter someones mind and memories through their dreams. So a dream thief
(leonardo)is sent into a persons mind to achieve &#x22;inception&#x22;<br /><br />Now everybody is going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was
just silly. The way they explained it and the explanations they had for
everything were convoluted and silly. Then it had about hour of story
and then about a hour and a half of shooting guns. You would think a
movie with this complicated of story line would describe the story in
depth but no. It piles on the information one thing after another in a
ridiculous manner. <br /><br />If you liked the matrix and are usually a fan of this kind of Sci-Fi
thing then this movie is most likely for you. If you are like me and
prefer a movie to have solid story development and you want it to make
total sense please stay away from this. The only reason i gave it 6 was
because it was high budget it had leo and also some pretty stunning
moments.
