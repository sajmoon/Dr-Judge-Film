Make no mistake: this is the best film of 2010. Notice I don&#x27;t say &#x22;so
far&#x22;, because it will be extremely tough to top everything this movie
does right. Nolan is a good story-teller, dating way back to his
&#x22;Memento&#x22; days. However, with this film, he cements his status as a
superb writer. What could&#x27;ve been a Lynch-esquire blob of confusion
about dreams and alternate realities, Nolan effortlessly weaves his
time line and narrative so that most viewers can understand it with a
first viewing. The cast is superb (Leo is subdue when he has to be and
raging when it&#x27;s needed) as our protagonist and the Extractor and Tom
Hardy is a real standout as the Forger. It was also great to see
Cotillard have a part unlike her past roles, that of an intruder and
overall gnat for this &#x22;Dream Team&#x22;. The plot is high-concept and
high-class, but it never plays down to you or make you feel inferior.
It&#x27;s really centered on entering the mind of one man to force him to
make a unique decision. But within that mind, there lies dreamscapes
and locales weaved from the collective minds of our team, and they
delve layer by layer into the unknown. It&#x27;s ambitious, it&#x27;s risky, and
it&#x27;s brilliant.<br /><br />With dream movies, the limit is your imagination so you need
spectacular set pieces and effects to help it come to life. Inception
was no exception. Fantastic visuals and gorgeous locales lit up the
screen. Of course, with great visuals, you need great music to
complement it. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself, providing a pounding
and haunting score which is, again, probably the best soundtrack of the
year. And, finally, there&#x27;s the ending.<br /><br />After the brilliance we&#x27;re exposed to, we&#x27;re given with an ending that
left my theater with a collective &#x22;sigh&#x22;, &#x22;awww!&#x22;, and &#x22;Come On!&#x22; When
you can illicit a response like that, you know you&#x27;ve made either a
really good or really bad movie. Fortunately for Inception, it&#x27;s the
former. Maybe the ending&#x27;s what you make it. Nolan may have just left
it up to you, or maybe a second viewing will uncover something that was
missed. Regardless, it&#x27;s a great way to end a great movie.
