I&#x27;d like to keep my review rather to the point.<br /><br />Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least.
There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. <br /><br />2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. <br /><br />3. its edgy drive - although you know what&#x27;s coming next, still you
feel jumpy about it when it does.<br /><br />4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to
another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At
times, it&#x27;s hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. <br /><br />5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and
digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I
believe. <br /><br />6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least
tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions,
some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.<br /><br />Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was
convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I
wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s)
after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional
struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you
ask me. <br /><br />2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters
than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed
more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more
focused. <br /><br />3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things
about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie.
I&#x27;m afraid, Inception overused this trick. <br /><br />In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without
room for improvement. <br /><br />I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks,
if you dig this kind of flicks. <br /><br />Cheers!
