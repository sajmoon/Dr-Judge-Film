After giving us Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins and The Dark
Knight, Nolan one again found a way to create a masterpiece with his
latest picture Inception. Everything in that movie is superb : the
acting, the special effects (minimun CGI sh*t), the soundtrack, the
plot, the editing, the direction, etc. I have no doubt in my mind that
the masterpiece called Inception will be remembered for years even
decades to come since the movie is open to interpretation like many
science fiction classics such as Blade Runner and 2001. For those who
have not seen Inception yet, do yourself a favour and watch it now.
Don&#x27;t miss Hollywood history in the making people.
