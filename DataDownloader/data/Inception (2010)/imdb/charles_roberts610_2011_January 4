A brief, honest review for those who do not like long reviews:<br /><br />This is the movie that I&#x27;ve been waiting for my whole life. Inception
is a one of a kind movie.It exceeds in many levels. And here are a few
reason why the movie is just AWESOME<br /><br />1)The acting is top notch, I mean there are a total of five Academy
Award nominees in the cast.<br /><br />2)Christopher Nolan makes the working of the subconscious so realistic
that you swear to God that he has a PhD in Psychology... Even If it
wasn&#x27;t real I bought it and so will you....<br /><br />3)Some people compare Inception to The Matrix but honestly Inception
makes The Matrix look like Bambi. <br /><br />4)Yes the movie is complex and it is hard to follow at times but that&#x27;s
where the fun lies in and trust me your brain will be exercised at the
end of this movie.<br /><br />5)About the story? 6 individual invade a mind to perform inception? If
that&#x27;s not original then I don&#x27;t know what is....<br /><br />I can keep going on and on about how good the movie really is but I&#x27;d
be just giving away too much. Inception was the greatest cinematic
experience I&#x27;ve ever had in years and to those unimaginative people who
called this movie boring, overrated or lame go ahead and go watch your
Transformer 2/G.I. Joe movie double feature and just be content. For
the rest of you go watch Inception.
