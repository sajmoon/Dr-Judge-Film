This movie is high energy but the problem with that is that it never
stops. There is no contrast to it. High tension the entire time. No
release and it wears out quickly to the point you don&#x27;t even want to
finish watching it. Too much repetition was included in this movie.
Action sequences were too long and added nothing to the story. It
needed a film editor to cut about an hour of it just to make it
watchable.<br /><br />Then there is the plot. A plot which was thinning wrapped around all
the action and special effects. You got the feeling that you were
watching a computer video game and not an actual story. Far too much
distraction and time spent on the lead character&#x27;s personal life
problem and he trying to deal with it.
