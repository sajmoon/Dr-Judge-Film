I honestly think that Christopher Nolan is incapable of making a bad
film. I mean let&#x27;s look back on his work. &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; was a
fantastic reboot to the &#x22;Batman&#x22; franchise. And &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; was
absolutely amazing! As a matter of fact, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; is in my
opinion the #2 best movie ever made. His other work includes &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22;, &#x22;Memento&#x22;, and &#x22;Insomnia&#x22; and all of those were fantastic!
Anyway, now let&#x27;s talk about &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely mind blowing. The storyline was very original.
One of the most original story lines I&#x27;ve seen in a very long time. The
whole concept of accessing people&#x27;s dreams and the whole idea of the
process they call inception was very well thought out. The visuals were
also simply amazing. The visuals in &#x22;Inception&#x22; made &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; look
like a backyard movie. And the ending is... Well, I&#x27;m not gonna spoil
it but it&#x27;s pretty awesome. The whole movie has you thinking for days
after you&#x27;ve seen it. It&#x27;s a movie worth seeing twice. The acting was
also fantastic. Nolan put together a perfect ensemble of a cast. I also
saw this movie twice. Once in standard 35mm and IMAX. No matter what
format you see it in, it&#x27;s spectacular. Kudos to you Christopher Nolan.
You&#x27;ve blown us all away once again.
