This is a movie where the audience needs to see the movie twice to
fully grasp the entire plot. In this case, it is definitely not a bad
thing. I just got back from the IMAX showing of Inception a second
time, fully blown away by visuals that put Avatar to shame.<br /><br />Despite the incredible special effects, it is the sheer complexity of
Inception that is the masterpiece.<br /><br />This movie earns a 10/10 for mastering all the genres of movies into
one. Action, Suspense, Drama, Comedy, Science Fiction, etc etc etc. I
have not met one person who has hated Inception.<br /><br />Nolan at his best so far, and yes this is coming from a Dark Knight
fanatic. It only leaves us wishing for more. If this movie does not win
Best Picture, I don&#x27;t know what will.<br /><br />10/10
