WAY OVERRATED! Makes you wonder if IMDb should re-think their ranking
formula. I&#x27;d say Inception deserves a 6 or 7. But to be the #6 movie of
all-time, you need character development. There was none. Zero, zip,
nada. We&#x27;re told that here&#x27;s Leonardo, and here&#x27;s an Asian guy who
wants him to go into a dream, and that&#x27;s it. Boom, now start the
action. I will say that the concept was very good. It could have been a
great movie if they would have left in some action, but cut out about
45 minutes of it and substituted character and dream-sequences/plot,
rather than just wild chases/shoot-outs. During these parts I found
myself very bored.
