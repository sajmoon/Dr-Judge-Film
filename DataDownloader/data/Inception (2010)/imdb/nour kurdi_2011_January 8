I&#x27;m a huge fan of movies and i think i have finished the IMDb top 250
list for best movies ever made.<br /><br />but first let me tell you something about it. in this classical list i
have found some movies which has an astonishing reviews and rated as if
it&#x27;s the best in it&#x27;s genre (but it wasn&#x27;t)!! the only reason that
these movies has a very high ratings is because the originality of it,
means these movies will not make it if it got released again.<br /><br />and then i saw INCEPTION (3 times) and i can tell you it gets better
every time you watch it, INCEPTION was actually something different and
you will not see anything that can be compared to it, therefore it will
change the history of film making and will inspire movies to come as it
became an unforgettable BENCHMARK which is clearly a challenge for
Hollywood to come up with something as magical as it is..<br /><br />everyone saw this movie just waited till its finished to put it on the
top of their lists for movies that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan at this age (40 years) has proved to the world his
eligibility for winning all the academy awards related to his
contribution in making this movie.<br /><br />Inception will change your perspectives and the ways you see things,
will keep you at the edge of your seat, you&#x27;ll be finding yourself in
the middle of nowhere thinking about what the F**k just happened.<br /><br />10 out of 10 (best movie ever made).<br /><br />Nour Kurdi.
