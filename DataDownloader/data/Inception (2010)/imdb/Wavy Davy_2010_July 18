I am sick and tired of hearing rumours about Marvel or Universal
wanting to do yet another remake or reboot. Surely after the disgust
that was &#x27;The Day the Earth Stood Still&#x27; remake, Hollywood would have
realised how poor these kind of films are, but alas, no. There are
still faint rumours that the Hulk franchise might be rebooted AGAIN...<br /><br />So Christopher Nolan has created something so fresh, new and exciting
that I must praise him to the heavens. The idea is simple: what if you
could enter someone elses dream and find their subconscious thoughts.
The film, however, becomes much more complicated. <br /><br />The best in the world at this process of &#x27;extraction&#x27; is Cobb (Leonardo
di Caprio), who goes into the minds of certain targets in order to
obtain valuable secrets. He must alter his process to Inception, which
involves planting an idea in someones head, rather than stealing one.
He and his team (Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Tom Hardy, Ken
Watanbe and Dileep Rao) must carry out this final job in order for Cobb
to be allowed back into the United States to see his children. <br /><br />The film is quite complicated, admirably, but it is not nearly as
difficult to follow as many reviews have stated. If you are watching
with a good amount of attention, it should be easy enough to follow,
even if it takes a few minutes to understand some of the more confusing
parts. <br /><br />Di Caprio is not completely engaging in the emotive action (mainly
revolving his deceased wife played by Marion Cotillard), but he does a
very good job all the same, and makes a believable action star. Ellen
Page is slightly miscast as the teams &#x27;architect&#x27;, as she does not
carry off the thoroughly intelligent look. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt and Tom
Hardy are most impressive as slick team-players, and it is a shame they
are not developed more than Lewitt&#x27;s slight romance with Page and
Hardy&#x27;s slight rivalry with Lewitt. Michael Caine pops in for a neat
cameo, too.<br /><br />The film manages to convey the grand-nature of how our dreams feel
through a number of set-pieces. I find it baffling that some critics
say that Nolan misses the fact that our dreams are not so clear, and
instead are very hazy. This argument does not make sense to me since
when we are in the dream, it feels completely real, and so Nolan&#x27;s
vision makes sense. I&#x27;d say this film is more engaging than the Dark
Knight, as it does not feel so overlong and overbloated, and manages a
very, very good ending which makes you feel good and then suddenly
makes everything dubious...<br /><br />Go see it, you&#x27;ll love it!
