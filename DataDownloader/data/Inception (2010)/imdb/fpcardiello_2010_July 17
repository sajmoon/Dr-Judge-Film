In Plato&#x27;s The Republic, philosopher Socrates describes his famous
allegory of the cave. A man awakens from a stupor in which he believes
some images on a cave in front of him are his reality. A bright light
leads him to wander out of a cave and there he finds a true reality.
But what if that true reality was simply a vehicle to lead that man to
another cave, which led him to another reality, and to another cave,
and so on. What if these layers of false caves and true realities
merged until the man could no longer distinguish between the two. And
what if the cave was not as false as it once seemed, and what if
reality was not as true as it appeared? This the scenario in which
Christopher Nolan, auteur of The Dark Knight and Memento, imagines for
us in his sprawling, epic blockbuster masterpiece. To simply describe
my sentiments of Inception, Willie Waffle (real name) of
WaffleMovies.com simply stated: &#x22;This is what movies can be like if you
try.&#x22; Despite the marketing flurry sweeping the world for Inception&#x27;s
release this week, its story remains an enigma. What exactly is about,
so many people have asked? Now having experienced the two and half hour
roller-coaster ride, it&#x27;s hard to describe. I could say it&#x27;s one of
those last jobs flicks where Dom Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio), an
experienced dream thief, assembles a team to commit the ultimate
corporate act of mischief. His team, rather than extracting an idea
from a rival, but instead implant one. It&#x27;s also one man&#x27;s struggles to
overcome his demons and achieve equilibrium in his life. It&#x27;s also an
allegory and analysis of the relationship between dreams and reality.
Whatever it is, it will blow your mind.<br /><br />Much like 1999&#x27;s classic The Matrix, Inception will present a world
that will make you forever question the world you live in as well as
deeper explore whatever dreams you may have. Usually, said dreams are
throwaways moments that frequent us while we sleep at night. But is
something more important embedded in those dreams? And what of ideas,
of our inspirations - where do those stem from? Inception completely
deconstructs metaphysics and subconsciousness before our eyes, leaving
the viewer agape at what unfolds. And this is all happening in a $160+
million sci-fi actioner? And a major studio, Warner Brothers, backed
this and gave Christopher Nolan free reign? I sincerely hope America
and the world embraces this film as they did The Dark Knight two years
ago. This is a monumental work that will push Hollywood to make more
films like it - where care went into every frame, where story is indeed
king. Inception is a film that reminds us why we go to the movies, why
storytelling has been around since mankind&#x27;s beginning. It is smart,
complex, moving, heartbreaking, mind-blowing, mind-numbing, unsettling,
exhilarating, wholly original, and devilishly intricate. It is a film
all directors should aspire to make, screenwriters to write, and
producers finance. If all moviegoers see this film for what it really
is, it may well incite a cinematic revolution. We need more movies like
this. Thank you Christopher Nolan for doing what so many other
filmmakers fail to, care. Mr. Dicaprio, Mr. Gordon-Levitt, and Ms. Page
all deserve Oscar nominations. Mr. Nolan deserves a Best Picture
nomination finally, and a win for his screenplay. Technically speaking,
Inception is awe-inspiring: degrading cities, stunning zero gravity
action sequences, and top lensing by Mr. Wally Pfister. Inception is a
masterpiece of the highest order. See it, now.<br /><br />Grade: A+ Best, Francesco
