Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this
incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight
face, actors deliver lines such as &#x22;dreams within dreams is too
unstable&#x22; and &#x22;if we get killed we&#x27;ll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn into scrambled egg.&#x22; DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This
movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of
dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it
goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours.
And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one&#x27;s
normal life is to limbo under a totem pole.
