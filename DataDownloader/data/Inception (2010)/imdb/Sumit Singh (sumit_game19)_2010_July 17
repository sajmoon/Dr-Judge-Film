From the mind behind the neo-noir bliss Following, the innovative
Memento, the rare good remake Insomnia, the amazing Batman Begins, the
twisting thriller The Prestige &#x26; the masterpiece The Dark Knight, comes
a vision he has been carrying for a decade in his mind, Inception,
which is sure to challenge the viewers like no movie did for a long
time. It&#x27;s the most complex sci-fi film out there since The Matrix.<br /><br />Taking inspiration from every great sci-fi film in cinema history
(2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Matrix),
Christopher Nolan has created an original masterpiece that blurs the
thin line between dreams &#x26; reality &#x26; which is going to be the subject
of discussion between movie-buffs for a long time. Blending the
brilliant story with his distinct narrative style &#x26; sweeping cinematic
vision, this time Christopher Nolan has raised the bar for his
audiences, probably more than he did in Memento. So this time, all it
asks of viewers is that they do something rare: engage the intellect.<br /><br />Inception is a contemporary sci-fi thriller set within the architecture
of the mind. It shows a world where a technology exists to enter
people&#x27;s dreams &#x26; share them. It simply relies on the idea that if
something gives you the access to somebody&#x27;s unconscious mind, what
would that be used &#x26; abused for? What Nolan has done here is to raise
the emotional stakes of the protagonist to drive the film rather than
overshadowing it with the idea of dream &#x26; memory. Also, he could have
explored the complete madness in the dream by bending every physics law
possible, but he didn&#x27;t because he wanted to blur the line between
dreams &#x26; reality &#x26; let the audience wonder what they are watching. And,
he did succeed.<br /><br />What has been one great thing in Nolan&#x27;s films is the casting. Always
in his films there is an ensemble cast that quickly grasps the
director&#x27;s vision &#x26; delivers it perfectly too. Inception boasts some of
the highly skilled actors in cinema today in Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken
Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine etc &#x26; was a
huge leap for actors like Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Tom Hardy &#x26; Ellen Page.<br /><br />Leonardo plays Cobb, the Extractor who steals his clients&#x27; ideas &#x26; is
given a chance at redemption by fulfilling one last mission. DiCaprio
has been one of the best actors of this generation at present &#x26; played
Cobb perfectly in the film &#x26; it was this character&#x27;s emotional journey
that was the driving force of the movie. He &#x26; his team are supposed to
pull off a miracle in the dreamworld &#x26; Cobb has to fight his inner
demons as well while going on with the mission. Another superb
performance by Leonardo, even though it had little similarities with
his last on-screen character, Teddy in Martin Scorcese&#x27;s Shutter Island
but I would rate this one, the better.<br /><br />The rest of the cast did amazingly well too but there was no
performance bigger than the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur,
the Point Man &#x26; did really well, especially in the corridor fight scene
which was the show-stealer. Tom Hardy plays Eames, The Forger &#x26; looked
like almost stealing the show with his calm yet clever performance. Ken
Watanabe, Ellen Page &#x26; Michael Caine did justify their parts pretty
well. But, the most pivotal role was brilliantly played by Marion
Cotillard as Mal &#x26; saying anything more about this character will be a
spoiler.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects, Inception is a marvel from the
beginning to end. The Art Direction magic can be seen from the
beginning only. Cinematography played a pivotal role in blurring lines
between dreams &#x26; reality. And it did confuse the viewers as intended by
Nolan. Editing was very good &#x26; I think nearly every scene was important
to the plot. Coming to the Visual Effects, the only part it played was
in amplifying the experience just enough to take you to a whole new
level. CGI has been minimally used when compared to other sci-fi films
&#x26; most of the shots that we think were computer generated effects were
actually captured on camera in real. If you doubt it, I recommend you
watch HBO First Look for Inception to clear them.<br /><br />Another aspect that played a pivotal role in this film is the music.
Composed by the best composer of the decade, Hans Zimmer, the music of
Inception is haunting &#x26; perfect for the tone of the film. The beats
feel like you&#x27;re in a different world with illusions all around &#x26;
contributed amazingly well to the theme of the film. For a sci-fi that
deals with shared dreaming, the music of Inception simply stands out &#x26;
Hans Zimmer deserves yet another bow for giving another haunting piece
of stunning music.<br /><br />All in all, Inception is a groundbreaking, intriguing, exhilarating and
brilliant sci-fi thriller that&#x27;s destined to become a timeless classic.
Smart, innovative, and thrilling, Inception is a movie people will go
see and then argue about and then, very likely, go see again. It is
instantly the must-see film of the summer.<br /><br />It was an honor to watch Inception first day first show. Thank You
Christopher &#x27;The Genius&#x27; Nolan. Take a bow, Sir.<br /><br />Repeated Viewings Highly Recommended.
