Wow!!! When i first saw the trailer of Inception i was intrigued... i
wanted to see it badly....usually when movies are hyped by brilliant
trailers the movie fails to live up to its expectations.... but every
rule has exceptions and Inception is that one Exception!!It was one
hell of a ride!!! Its one of those movies which demands your full
attention every second... and it does brilliantly to achieve that..
trust me when i tell you it can never bore you... its a great movie...
absolutely scintillating.. a Masterpiece... Its just one of those all
time classics!! <br /><br />Christopher Nolan has yet again proved he is one of the best in the
business... sheer genius is what i would call him... Its one of those
movies that at first seems confusing but if you give it your full
attention(Which is really easy in this case) you would understand what
Nolan is trying to show us...It makes you think twice... makes you
wanna watch it again.. makes you perplexed,makes you excited,makes you
happy and thrills you... Its just marvelous.. words don&#x27;t do justice to
what a wonderful movie this is...no you should watch it, experience
it.!!<br /><br />DiCaprio&#x27;s run of success continues as he gives us yet another awesome
performance...He was just perfect for this role... it suited him
brilliantly and i don&#x27;t think anyone could have done it better than
him...!! Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe,
Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard all give equally brilliant
performances... The visual effects are fantastic... the sound effects
brilliant.. one the whole its a mind blowing...simply superb...
absolutely Enthralling movie!!! Its one of the Best pictures ever to be
made and would most definitely be one of those rare movies that can
never be forgotten!!! La Saluto Nolan!!!
