I watched this movie after having read at the press that one must be
ready to view a dream at three levels(a dream within a dream within a
dream)-in the movie the levels are actually five not three, but the
information of the press helped me to find a way through the film&#x27;s
maze. The press also said that this film should not make you feel that
you have a low IQ if you do not understand it at once- I admit that all
this prior information made me to strive to understand the plot and
although I can not say that I understood everything I think I
understood enough.<br /><br />Many things are interesting in this complex story: the protagonist&#x27;s
personal love and family drama, the people that stuff the heterogeneous
team that accompanies him in his final mission each of whom has
specialty in the division of labour in dream manipulating, convincing
us that we truly live in an era of specialization in all aspects of
life, and of course the final decisive mission which spans in three
dream layers-those that were planned-plus two others that were decided
on the spot and to which not all the characters of the team
participate.<br /><br />It is really glorious to watch people trying to synchronize their
actions within the environment of many dreams which are included one in
the other like the layers of an onion&#x27;s flesh. The variety of the dream
environments is also astounding: the airplane, the luxury hotel, the
snowy mountains(reminding the setting of the &#x22;The Empire Strikes
Back&#x22;).<br /><br />The actors support ably their roles and the good point is the variety
of characters that is presented:tough and mellow, male and female,
intellectual and muscular-all have a place in the &#x22;dream team&#x22;.To
elaborate on the composition of that team which includes Di Caprio as
Cobb, the leader haunted by the reminiscence of his wife which stalks
his subconscious,Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, his mild &#x22;leutenant&#x22; an
intellectual with quiet force,Ellen Page as Ariadne-the dream architect
and star student in Paris who is the character that builds a strong
bond with Cobb in the process of the dream, Tom Hardy as Eames-the
toughest of the team physically and the one with the ability to change
shape within the dream-an ability he shares with X-Men Mystique to find
similarities with other movies- who is instrumental for the success of
the mission, Dileep Rao as Yusuf, the chemist and ethnic character who
creates the substances able to sustain a dream of such depth and length
and finally Ken Watanabe as Saito, the team&#x27;s financial patron and the
one who has made a pledge with Cobb, whom the others regard as a
&#x22;tourist&#x22; at first but who is reunited with Cobb in the deepest layer
of the dream.<br /><br />Cleverly the movie makes Saito, Di Caprio&#x27;s employer and also companion
say that the aim of planting an idea in the mind of Fischer junior aims
to dismantle his father&#x27;s energy empire which threatens supplies and
the energy market as well as Saito&#x27;s particular interests, thus giving
moral credibility and the sympathy of the audience for a team of
characters whose mission and deeds one could consider not always
laudable to say the least.<br /><br />For my taste the sequences with Cotillard and Di Caprio where sometimes
too sentimental and overextended and Saito&#x27;s (the character played by
Watanabe) power and wealth rather unexplained and those points are the
ones that I think made the movie a bit susceptible to criticism.<br /><br />I liked the effects and the way space and movement were treated in the
movie as well as the architectural elements of buildings and roads in
wildly differing built environments as Paris and American metropolises.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, for the originality of the scenario, the good
actors and the fact that the heroes move in a variety of environments
all having fine design and able to sustain a lot of interest from the
viewer.
