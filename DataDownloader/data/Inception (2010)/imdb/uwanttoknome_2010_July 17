This movie is fantastic. I do not know where to begin. It leaves you
with the same wondrous feeling Avatar gives you when you first see it.
The acting is brilliant, the effects fantastic, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
directing is superb but the best thing is his screenplay. The story
just like The Dark Knight among others is completely captivating and
entrancing. The plot is insanely complicated like Nolan&#x27;s Memento but
this is easier to follow and is a much better film. This is by far the
best movie to come out in 2010 and may win the academy award for Best
Picture. It deserves to be nominated for so many things. It deserves a
nod for Best Actor (DiCaprio), Best Supporting Actress (Marion
Cotillard/Ellen Page), Best Original Screenplay &#x26; Direction (Nolan),
Effects, &#x26; Best Picture. That is 7 Nominations. I am not even thinking
about sound and editing and minor things like that. Of course we must
wait for the second half of the year to finish up but I have a hard
time imagining another film beating this out for Best Picture. The film
keeps you gripped and plays with your mind the entire film. I loved
these other two films but it is better then The Dark Knight and Avatar.
Avatar just does not have the originality that this film has. This is a
masterpiece and is the best film Christopher Nolan has ever done and he
has done some great movies. If you would like to talk to me about this
