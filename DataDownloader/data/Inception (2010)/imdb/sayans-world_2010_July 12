When i see any upcoming NOLAN films, i cannot hold my nerves
together...Starting from the sheer brilliance of MEMENTO,THE
PRESTIGE,THE DARK KNIGHT n all perhaps he is the most talented and
thought innovative director in Hollywood..In other words, unless u see
a NOLAN film till the climax , u cant&#x27;t predict it&#x27;s ending n that&#x27;s
what i like about him...He simply keeps puzzling the past and the
present in perhaps the most thoughtful way... Coming 2 the film, its
another gem of a work by Di Caprio after SHUTTER ISLAND...N wen u have
casting like MICHAEL CAINE,ELLEN PAGE,Joseph GORDON- LEVITT etc its
surely a must watch..I can assure u that u cant&#x27;t even leave a single
second while watching the film..It&#x27;s a sci-fi,thriller directed by
NOLAN..That says it all... Afterall &#x22;YOUR MIND IS THE SCENE OF THE
CRIME&#x22;... Frankly speaking a must watch movie without any doubt....
