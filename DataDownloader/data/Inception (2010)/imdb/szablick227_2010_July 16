Christopher Nolan you never disappoint me. With the dark knight and now
this!! How does this guy do this. Well first off inception takes you
where no other film ever has. One of the most original screenplays
today. The plot is simple the movie itself is so complex. It is filled
with action suspense and takes you a huge variety of places. Usually in
a movie there&#x27;s a Climax or final showdown. Where there is one thing or
job left to do. Those sequences usually last 30-40 minutes but here it
take a good hour and a half. This is a movie that will leave you
thinking and talking. Describing this movie is truly difficult because
words cannot describe this masterpiece. This is a must see movie and
honestly one of the best movies that I&#x27;ve seen to this day. Inception
sure as hell delivers!
