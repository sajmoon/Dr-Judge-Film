Inception was not that great of a movie. There. I said it. I can&#x27;t
believe so many people from the reviews of IMDb.com to my closest
friends walking out of this saying this was a great film. Maybe that
was my problem. I went into this film thinking this was going to be
great but that just wasn&#x27;t the case. I wasn&#x27;t involved with the story.<br /><br />And story was the film&#x27;s main selling point. Yeah, there&#x27;s the visuals,
yeah. They are spectacular, I won&#x27;t lie. I love how the world moves
with their minds and how they were able to get the actors to interact
to an otherwise unusual world. And normally the effects is Hollywood&#x27;s
only strength, to draw their audience in with spectacular CGI. No,
Inception wants to engross you into it&#x27;s story.<br /><br />Many were lost. I just did not care.<br /><br />The story mostly revolves around dreams. It&#x27;s like plugging into the
Matrix and the Avatar. Now that I think of it, maybe that&#x27;s what
audiences like. Maybe the average moviegoer likes characters who become
something that isn&#x27;t themselves. Maybe they like characters who are
strapped in to a bed or some sort, plugged into something, and then
they are subjected into a different world where they have to fight to
survive.<br /><br />But if this idea is what Hollywood is catching onto then believe me, it
will get old fast. People would look back on this and wonder why
audiences liked this in the first place. Inception is not one of those
films that will be remembered with some of the greats, especially
Nolan&#x27;s own Batman films. It just doesn&#x27;t have that kind of impact.
Visually, it&#x27;s stunning, but storywise, no.<br /><br />But hey, if it&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.
