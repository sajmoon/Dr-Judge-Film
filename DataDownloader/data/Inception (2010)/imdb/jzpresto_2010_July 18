Once again Hollywood grinds out another shoot-em-up, this time in the
guise of a mind-exploration film. Come on: who&#x27;s fooling whom? the film
is directed at an audience whose attention span has been honed on video
games: they can&#x27;t go on unless he/she sees a dead body or car crash
every second.<br /><br />As for the story, why not have all parties sit down and chill out on
good weed or opium? Much cheaper than getting all those guns and
first-class plane tickets. Some roles are dreadfully miscast.
Watanabe&#x27;s English is just not up to snuff and Ellen Young looks
totally inappropriate.<br /><br />And that ending! &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22; accomplished the same thing with a lot
less bloodshed and just one memorable word, &#x22;Rosebud&#x22;.
