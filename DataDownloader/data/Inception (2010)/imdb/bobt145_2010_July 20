&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a terrific mix of think and thought.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has made story paramount and beefed up as many action
scenes as possible. Somewhat neglected in that mix is the role of
character.<br /><br />If you loved &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; than this is for you, in spades.<br /><br />By using dream within a dream story lines, we see the same people doing
different things at the same time. It&#x27;s not all that challenging to
keep track of four or five levels at a time, especially if you accept
the premise that time flows more rapidly the deeper you get.<br /><br />Five minutes in real time is an hour on level one and the bottom level
can consume a lifetime.<br /><br />For me, the fabulous sets and the intricacies of the dream structure
had me riveted to the action. But I did long for some character
development, a nuance that wasn&#x27;t related to that person&#x27;s dream story.<br /><br />The choice of Ellen Page is particularly questionable. She doesn&#x27;t seem
to have the depth of expression of even an ordinary actor and as one of
only two women featured, should be better.<br /><br />But there are some fabulous effects. Roped bodies moved as a weightless
pile through corridors and elevators. A falling bus on the second level
that takes forever to hit the water into which it eventually plunges.<br /><br />The planting of seeds isn&#x27;t some new concept. The next time you thirst
for a drink you&#x27;ve never tasted, think advertising and you&#x27;ve come up
with your own seed.<br /><br />If you ask why such a good rating, with so many detractions, well, it&#x27;s
really an 8-and-a-half and it is damn good at what it does.
