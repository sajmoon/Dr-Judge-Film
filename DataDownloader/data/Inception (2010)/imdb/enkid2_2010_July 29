This is from the guy who brought us great titles like &#x22;Memento&#x22; and the
new &#x22;Batmans&#x22; and it&#x27;s right up there. This has got to be one of my
favourite cast of all time: Leo&#x27;s good in pretty much anything (
Basketball Diaries, The Beach, Gangs of New York to name a few), Joseph
G-Levitt ( 500 Days of Summer, Brick and Mysterious Skin are all
awesome), then you&#x27;ve got Lukas Haas (also in Brick) and Tom Hardy
(funny as hell in Rock n&#x27; Rolla). But wait... here&#x27;s more: Ellen Page
(from Juno and the insane Hard Candy), Ken Watanabe (who IS the LAST
Samurai), Michael Caine (check him out in Harry Brown and The Quiet
American), Marion Cotillard (got an Oscar for her performance in La Vie
en Rose, looked good in Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (did a good job
in Batman Begins as Scarecrow and also in Sunshine) and for the old
school you&#x27;ve got Tom Berenger (Platoon anyone?) and Pete Postlethwaite
(who was the monk in Dragonheart : ) , Kobayashi in The Usual Suspects
and I just saw him in the borderline passable Clash of the Titans
remake). WHEWWWW<br /><br />Now the movie is awesome, great food for thought since I&#x27;m a Lucid
Dreamer. See it, See it twice, then recommend it to someone who hasn&#x27;t
seen it.<br /><br />All in all: This might be the new Matrix
