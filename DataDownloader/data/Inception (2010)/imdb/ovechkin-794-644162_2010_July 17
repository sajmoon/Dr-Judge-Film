The studio instead went against the guaranteed-money grain by producing
a film based on a story not many people knew, and for that I thank
them.<br /><br />Inception is beautiful. The cinematography is top notch, and the story
is intriguing. When the film really picks up, it sustains it&#x27;s momentum
in a way I have never seen.<br /><br />My only issue is with the action. The story in Inception is so strong,
I found myself wishing the action would hurry up so I could find out
more.<br /><br />This film is one to remember.
