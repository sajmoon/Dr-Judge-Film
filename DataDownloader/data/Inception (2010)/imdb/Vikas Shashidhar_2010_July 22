To describe Inception in a single adjective will never be enough. The
sheer magnitude at which this movie happens is simply exceptional. It
could&#x27;ve only been pulled off by someone as good as Chris Nolan. I can
go on and on about praising this movie was hours, that&#x27;s months in
dream level one and years in dream level two. :)<br /><br />Put it simply, this is the best movie I&#x27;ve watched in my life because
of it&#x27;s idea, it&#x27;s execution and it&#x27;s emotional depth. People always
moan about Nolan&#x27;s movies not being emotional, but this one is
definitely not one of them. You will feel for Cobb and Mal. Di Caprio
has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb.
Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances. Tom
Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames. Cilian, as
usual has done job well. The rest of the cast have done a good job as
well. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent
times. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music is haunting. Editing by Lee Smith is top
notch. But this film truly belongs to Nolan. From the storyline to it&#x27;s
execution, Nolan oozes confidence in every department. Be it narration,
bringing awe-striking visuals or keeping us on the edge of our seats,
he has truly demonstrated that he&#x27;s not only one of the most
entertaining, but one of the most intelligent directors in world cinema
today. For that, take a bow Nolan!
