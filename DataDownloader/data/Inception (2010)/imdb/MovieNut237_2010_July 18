It&#x27;s easy to credit the American movie-going public with having the
highest theatrical IQ of anyone in the world. Yet somehow whenever a
Christopher Nolan movie hits theaters, that all seems to change. And
then all of a sudden, routine movie-goers magically turn into amateur
movie critics, declaring films like Inception to be the cinematic
equivalent to the messiah. Professional critics themselves search for
reasons to boldly resurrect Christopher Nolan in all his glory as the
Pied Piper of Hamelin, leading us through the dark annals of Michael
Bay&#x27;s 21st Century Hollywood nightmare.<br /><br />Nolan is a brilliant illusionist. Chris Nolan&#x27;s movies (and this
discussion can exclude Memento, which I think most can agree is a
fantastic and sensible film) have a strange power of turning
theater-goers&#x27; brains into mush, convincing them that what they have
just seen is better than any imaginable vision of heaven. I bet this
all sounds pretentious&#x96;and to some extent I hope it does. Because
taking the stance I&#x27;m taking may be the only way to get people to see
the same thing that I&#x27;m seeing. Which is that post-Memento Nolan is a
talentless hack who pulls the same brainwashing gimmicks from film to
film.<br /><br />It really is as if viewers are dreaming under a hypnotic Chris Nolan
spell when they watch his movies, disabling the functionality of their
brains once the credits start rolling. Equally baffled by this is David
Edelstein of NY Magazine who &#x22;truly has no idea what so many people are
raving about,&#x22; claiming that &#x22;it&#x27;s as if someone went into their heads
while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a
visionary masterpiece.&#x22; In fact, so many critics are in overwhelming
agreement over the greatness of Inception that Roger Ebert questions
whether or not anyone is allowed to disagree! Working hard? Or hardly
working? Addressing Nolan&#x27;s struggles at making sense of his own
script, Movie Line critic Stephanie Zacharek admits that &#x22;Because Nolan
can&#x27;t connect his visuals, he has to use words, and lots of them, to
let us know what characters are doing and why we should care.&#x22; This is
why 99% of the film serves an expository purpose. Zacharek further
remarks that Nolan&#x27;s lifelong reliance on Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score as a
means for anchoring our interest into what we&#x27;re seeing on-screen makes
Nolan less fit for &#x22;directing&#x22; and better suited for &#x22;directing
traffic.&#x22; No truer statement.<br /><br />The musical cues tell us when we should feel anxious or afraid instead
of allowing the visuals and emotions of the film to achieve this (which
clearly they&#x27;re incapable of doing). Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score (which,
eyes-closed, pleases the ears) is so heavily relied upon by the
incompetent Nolan that the entire film plays a 2.5 hour+ non-stop
musical track. The track even plays during exposition. It plays
throughout everything. Remove this track and I promise you that each
person steps out of the theater complaining how much of a bore
Inception was.<br /><br />Adds Zacharek, &#x22;If the career of Christopher Nolan is any indication,
we&#x27;ve entered an era in which movies can no longer be great. They can
only be awesome, which isn&#x27;t nearly the same thing.&#x22; From this I take
the following: Special Effects and visual imagery now supersede quality
stories with competent scripts and technically-sound directing. Avatar
brought new meaning to this. The Coen Brothers, Martin Scorsese and PT
Anderson among others are continually working against this.<br /><br />Inception is a great concept for a movie. But the movie itself serves
as little more than a misinformed psychoanalytical instruction manual
with little to no story or characters worth investing emotions in. Sure
we find it cool. Some of the visuals are candy to the eyes. But I can&#x27;t
help but think about how much of a rip Inception is off The Matrix. If
I had to rename Inception, it would be &#x22;The Matrix (for dummies).&#x22; One
false notion is that Inception is confusing because it&#x27;s &#x22;supposed to
be&#x22;&#x96;it is a mind-bender after all. No! Inception is confusing because
it makes absolutely no sense! Let&#x27;s stop giving the director credit for
not doing his homework instead of making excuses for him.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s talk the whole &#x22;Dream within a dream&#x22; nonsense. Dream-themed
films such as The Matrix, Total Recall, Strange Days, Dreamscape and
even the original A Nightmare on Elm Street define the rules of their
worlds well enough without relying too much on exposition. Having
dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams is not a calculated
strategy of Nolan&#x27;s, but rather a cop-out. The 2010 version of A
Nightmare on Elm Street uses the same strategy.<br /><br />The story-line is laughable and seems to only serve the hollow purpose
of making the $160 million + summer psych-thriller into a
run-of-the-mill Bourne Identity-like actioner.<br /><br />So no people. I will not see Inception an additional time to have my
&#x22;mind blown&#x22; or to try and see if I actually &#x22;get it.&#x22; I get it
completely and I hate it. I got The Book of Eli and I hated that as
well. Films which we need to see more than once are more often than not
failures from the get-go. Inception is no exception. If you care to see
Memento more than once then I encourage it. The movie makes sense and
the story is told purposefully and brilliantly. But come on now. It&#x27;s
about time to start lambasting Chris Nolan and seeing the rest of his
movies for what they really are: garbage in disguise.
