Christopher Nolan , does it again. After making remarkable movies like
Memento, The prestige and the spectacular Batman movies Chris has
outdone himself with Inception. The trailer does not really give away
much about the movie, so I was a little apprehensive first to watch
this movie. But I could not resist watching it in the theaters and
hence I saw it on the very first day.<br /><br />What can I say it simply blew my mind. What a brilliant idea and
imagination. The movie is so gripping that it simply glues you to your
seat. There was never a weak moment in the entire movie. The plot is a
little complicated but it unfolds itself so cleverly that you will be
left begging for more. I must admit it requires a lot of concentration
to actually understand the plot, but once you understand it its simply
amazing. Apart form the writing the movie stands out because of the
cast. Every character was such beautifully crafted and I specially
liked Mal played by Marion Cotillard. Eames played by Tom Hardy,
earlier seen in the movie Bronson (watch it as soon as possible, if you
haven&#x27;t seen it yet) was enchanting. Ellen page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian
Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also played there part really well.
Finally,Leonardo DiCaprio at his best again , he has played the
character of Cobb so well, that I would not want to see him as any
other character for the next few years. <br /><br />The movie has such an insane and brilliant story and it is carefully
executed and presented on such a beautiful canvas. The cinematography
was excellent , visual effects crisp and not overdone, the editing by
Lee Smith was so crisp and precise that I would watch any movie which
he edit hereon. The music by Hans Zimmer is so gripping that it takes
you on a ride. <br /><br />I will not explain the plot here as you have to watch it to believe it
and experience it. It has one element slightly similar to my another
favorite movie(MATRIX) but that makes it even better. This ones
definitely a 10 out of 10. I am definitely watching it again this
weekend, probably again and again.
