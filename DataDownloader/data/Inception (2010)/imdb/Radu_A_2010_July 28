OK, there are many raves as to how original &#x27;Inception&#x27; is, and it&#x27;s
definitely to be welcomed that a film which works with so many layers
should be such a success. And it&#x27;s more entertaining than &#x27;Prince of
Persia&#x27;, for sure. My fun was spoiled, however, by two factors.<br /><br />One, DiCaprio&#x27;s role is so similar to the character he played in
&#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; that, if you know the film, you may get a good idea
what&#x27;s going on before the main plot has even started rolling. That
could have been avoided by not using the same metaphors for remembrance
(the children, the wife), but I guess it&#x27;s just a coincidence. My
boyfriend, with whom I&#x27;ve seen this and who hasn&#x27;t seen &#x27;Shutter
Island&#x27;, took some more time to figure out the plot, so I guess it does
make a difference if you know that film or not.<br /><br />Two, there&#x27;s too much kaboom in &#x27;Inception&#x27; for filler, as in most of
Nolan&#x27;s other films since &#x27;Memento&#x27;. That may be just me getting old,
but when a film at first tries to intrigue me with a multi-layered
concept, and then bangs away both visually and soundtrack-wise to
distort your attention from any plot holes there may be, it&#x27;s a bit of
a let-down. &#x27;Matrix&#x27; (well, the first one) worked with its own
incoherences, and it still stands as a standard of the genre; I doubt
that &#x27;Inception&#x27; may, as time passes, outrank it, because repeat
viewings of stretched-out gunfire and bomb blasts tend to equal each
other in retrospect; it&#x27;s the engaging moments that create a
masterpiece - like Morpheus&#x27; breaking of the chains in &#x27;Matrix&#x27;, or
Rutger Hauer&#x27;s comment that memories vanish &#x27;like tears in rain&#x27; in
&#x27;Blade Runner&#x27;. All the interesting metaphysical talk in &#x27;Inception&#x27;,
as intriguing as it may be, cannot take root in my mind, as there&#x27;s no
character, no emotion, no pain to connect it to.<br /><br />Still, this is an entertaining way to spend an evening to be sure. Just
don&#x27;t expect a life-changing epiphany of sorts, as has been suggested
elsewhere.
