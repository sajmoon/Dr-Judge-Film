I have read several reviews in movie sites and critics stating this is
a movie is for people who think they are smart people. I am not a
scientist and I am not coming from a English language country. But what
I made out from the early review was that one must watch the film
trying not to miss even a single frame. The first half as many critics
pointed out is a bit slow, but I might add is not dull as many are
commenting. Then from the second half the film gathers pace and go
through breakneck speed with action and thrills in between. Most of the
critics saying they do not like the film were not concentrating enough
on the film to hate the film like they did. It is okay if people say
that the film is not great, but it is definitely untruthful to say that
the film is bad. I have not seen such an original concept in many years
and seriously feel that we movie loving public should support films
like this rather than superhero films. I am appalled at critics who
rate Twilight higher than Inception, I must say they have no taste and
this is what I would like to say to them &#x22;You mustn&#x27;t be afraid to
dream a little bigger, darling.&#x22;
