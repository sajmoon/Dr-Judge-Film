IMDb 9/10 ROTTEN TOMATOES 8/10 METACRITIC 7.4/10 ALLMOVIE 4/5<br /><br />First of all, I must say this film is very overrated. It&#x27;s
over-average, but it isn&#x27;t&#x27; great. It delivers some good and sometimes
unbelievable (not always in a good sense) action, it has some
interesting twists and performances are convincing enough, but that&#x27;s
about it. <br /><br />On the bad side, the film it&#x27;s a bit too long, the characters aren&#x27;t
well developed and the end isn&#x27;t very satisfactory.<br /><br />This film is a mix between Matrix (slow motion, different reality),
Memento (present/past vs dreamworld/ real world and flashbacks) and
James Bond (action).<br /><br />So, an entertaining movie with some interesting details but a somehow
disappointing end.
