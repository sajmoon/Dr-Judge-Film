Inception, the latest movie from director Christopher Nolan is by far
the most original, interesting, full of action, intelligent thriller of
the year. the movie tells the story of a group of corporative thieves
with a peculiar yet innovative method of stealing other people secrets,
entering to its own mind. The movie is an adrenaline rush, a mind
blowing journey that will leave you on the edge of your seat for almost
two hours and a half. It has such a fast pace rhythm that it is nearly
impossible to get distracted got even a second. The special effects are
incredible and the music gives a great atmosphere of suspense. The cast
is excellent and all of its members deliver flawless performances. Leo
DiCaprio is in his best moment, he is growing a lot as an actor, the
experience of Ken Watanabe is incredible, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon
Levitt are a pair of young actors with incredible abilities and Marion
Cotillard combines her beauty with her talent to shine on screen. With
this movie Christopher Nolan is on the top list of greatest directors,
of course if he wasn&#x27;t there yet. In conclusion, Inception is the
blockbuster of the year. Very recommendable.
