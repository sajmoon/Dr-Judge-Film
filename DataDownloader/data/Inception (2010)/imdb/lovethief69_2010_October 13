Epic Fail.<br /><br />People are to plug in a cable to some black box, close their eyes and
become visitors in other&#x27;s heads? Come on - thats way too simple and
too far away, if not absolutely impossible anywhere in our universe,
and never will.Given that, it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to get a grip
into that film. Too unrealistic. One&#x27;s think all the time is &#x22;that
cannot be&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;So is fiction!&#x22; one might admit.<br /><br />But for me Inception lacks the ability to lead its spectator over &#x22;that
final threshold&#x22; that lets us forget just and right that.<br /><br />I love C.Nolans interpretation of the Memento Mori. Kinda realistic.
Thrilling. One real classic.<br /><br />Inception is not. Look what happened to Avatar in #Top250.
