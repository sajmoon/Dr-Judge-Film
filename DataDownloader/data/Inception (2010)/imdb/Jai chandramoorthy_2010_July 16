A Script from Genius, A script for Genius....<br /><br />I watched the movie in Bangalore, India (PVR Cinemas), almost all the
people in the theater laughed when the end credits came. The reason is
most of them didn&#x27;t understand the movie. Even though the plot is
pretty much clear the dialog&#x27;s where vague.<br /><br />You have to see the movie again to understand the dialog&#x27;s.The movie is
all about the series of events in your mind when your are sleep. The
whole movie is not clear like our daily dreams. The instruction that
states the way things are or should be done, and tells you what you are
allowed or are not allowed to do are not clear for the normal minds.
You need to merge a lot into the movie to understand clearly.<br /><br />When I am walking out of the theater , everyone is telling their own
story in the way they have understood to their accompanied friends. But
thats not the way I understood the movie.<br /><br />It&#x27;s really a work of Genius Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />8/10.
