2011_January 2 
When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought to myself that
the film must have a magnificent storyline for this film to take off as
the amazing CGI in the trailer just had no foundation - until I saw it.<br /><br />The storyline by Chris Nolan was amazing - you get really involved with
the characters, and you think that you know just enough about dreams by
the time they plan their inception strategy - therefore, if you&#x27;re on
the ball, you should be able to follow it, and be able to discuss it at
length with your friends after the film ends.<br /><br />This film mixes together a huge range of cinematic delights - and it
comes out beautifully. The casting was fantastic, and Leonardo DiCaprio
has done very well to make it out of his Titanic fame...and grown into
a very respectable actor with a huge CV to show for it. The CGI was
mind- blowing, the famous clip from the trailer with the lifting of the
city in the horizon fitted perfectly with the storyline - and with that
same storyline in your head, and with the visual effects - you have no
choice but to be blown away. The storyline is the third delight, well
planned and prepared, and full of complexities and charm...it does very
well to stand. Obviously, you could (if you wanted to) look into great
depth about every scene...trying to make sure you know just what is
going on at each stage...and that&#x27;s what millions of people have been
doing. Great work by Chris Nolan here - he&#x27;s made a huge name for
himself now...after The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Prestige and
Memento - he&#x27;s heightened the bar even higher with Inception.<br /><br />At nearly two and a half hours, you&#x27;d think the film would struggle to
keep you captivated and involved in the story. You&#x27;d think that no one
would be able to follow it all the way until the end - but then you
watch it, and nearly everyone in the cinema is up to speed with you
(you can feel it - the dead silence at the tense scenes), then there is
a huge twist which you just didn&#x27;t see coming, and you know everyone
else in the cinema is thinking exactly the same as you...there is that
dead silence again once the credits start to roll whilst everyone takes
in what has just happened. THIS is what I think distinguishes a film
from the rest - leaving the audience captivated even during the
credits. This is a definite must see.
