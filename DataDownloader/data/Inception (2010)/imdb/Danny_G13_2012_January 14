I won&#x27;t deny, from the off, that I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan.
Everything the man touches turns to gold, and even his &#x27;weakest&#x27; movie
(Insomnia) is still exceptional.<br /><br />From the earlier (and simply perfect) Memento, to the Dark Knight,
Nolan has an astonishing gift for magnificent film making, clearly
enjoying a labour of love with every piece of cinema he painstakingly
creates.<br /><br />When Inception was announced and previewed, it looked like Nolan was
perhaps going to a new level of mastery. A psychological science
fiction about the manipulation, use, and mystery of dreams on an
epically grandiose scale. Given the man&#x27;s record prior to its release,
Inception looked like it might be his best work yet, and whether or not
it is widely considered as such, it is nevertheless undeniably an
astonishing piece of movie making which perfects every aspect of its
content, from the superb performances, to the staggering
cinematography, to the absolutely bewildering special effects, and of
course the seamless direction.<br /><br />Inception sees Leo DiCaprio&#x27;s Cobb take on an almost impossible mission
set to him by Ken Watanabe&#x27;s enigmatic Saito. Cobb specialises in
Extraction, a highly sought-after skill which sees extractors enter the
dreams of their &#x27;victims&#x27; in order to steal information sealed away in
their subconscious. Clients pay big money to gain this precious
information, and extractors like Cobb are in high demand for their
skills.<br /><br />The impossible mission in this case is the very opposition of
Extraction, which is Inception. Instead of stealing information from
individuals, Inceptions sees ideas being planted there. Ideas intended
to change the person&#x27;s very being and perception of life. Saito wants
Cobbs to Incept the idea in Cilian Murphy&#x27;s Fischer of not becoming
like his father and dominating the market of the company he owns. Saito
is a competitor and believes Fischer&#x27;s current path will destroy his
company and industry. In exchange Saito will make one phone call and
get Cobb legally back to the USA where his children have waited for him
for an unspecified time.<br /><br />This is where Cobb&#x27;s team come in - Ellen Page&#x27;s Ariadne is the
Architect who will design the dream&#x27;s structure and environment, Tom
Hardy&#x27;s Eames will &#x27;forge&#x27; characters, while Joseph-Gordon Levitt&#x27;s
Arthur is Cobb&#x27;s right hand man and performs vital utility duties so
the specialists can perform theirs.<br /><br />The question is will Cobb&#x27;s own demons wreck the mission, or will Saito
get what he desires, while simultaneously saving Cobb? Inception is
such an incredible and complex film that while the first viewing is a
rewarding experience, it requires a second or maybe a third to full
grasp the concepts contained therein, such are the layers and depth
contained here. Aspects which may baffle the first time become
completely coherent the second and the viewer is rewarded with an
astonishingly rich and philosophical canvas on which so many ideas and
elements flourish.<br /><br />While the story and direction themselves are masterful, Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
quite miraculous soundtrack give the experience an entirely extra
dimension. Tracks like Dream is Collapsing and Mumbasa are simply
extraordinary and are an essential component of the feel of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, it&#x27;s a wonderful story, with intelligence, provocative
ideas, great performances, and special effects on a staggering level
which will live in the memory for some considerable time.<br /><br />Just a pity Nolan is so disregarded by the Academy Awards...
