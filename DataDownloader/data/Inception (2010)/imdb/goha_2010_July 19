A pity. A fine idea. Just not quite pulled off with enough cinematic
craft and expertise. The script probably needed another draft to
transform the talkative explanations into a more cinematic form.<br /><br />A Mission Impossible IMF mixed with a Matrix-like world is a stunning
idea. Unfortunately, Inception doesn&#x27;t quite know whether it wants to
be a human drama, a tragedy, a high-concept sci-fi flick or just a
plain old thriller. It end up falling short of all of them.<br /><br />And DiCaprio is miscast. Personally, I think he is an empty-shirt of an
actor. All surface and no projection of any depth or enough
intelligence for this role.<br /><br />Inception runs over 2 hours, but feels heavily edited at the beginning
and the end. Despite this, it takes its time wordily explaining the
concept of &#x27;inception&#x27;, fails to develop any of the characters for the
audience, relies on the bombastic Hans Zimmer soundtrack too much and
utterly fails to build dramatic tension in the slow, too-drawn-out
conclusion.<br /><br />A great opportunity missed.
