At last the most anticipated Christopher Nolan Movie has finally
arrived. As we all know, Christopher Nolan is the visionary genius
behind one of the most captivating film ever made, The Dark Knight.It
supposedly took ten years for the entire screenplay of Inception to be
written and i believe that it was time well spent.From the smart witted
dialouge to the amazing special effects, this movie has got all the
right stuff to keep its audience mesmerized on the screen.I was
personally glad to see Ellen Page and Joseph Levitt performing in this
film, because it gave them both a chance to branch out of their usual
roles, and besides Hard Candy, this is Ellen Page&#x27;s most serious and
intense role, which I feel, she pulled off greatly. From start to
finish I felt that Inception never had a dull moment, and that I
could&#x27;ve easily sat through another two and a half hours just to see
the amazing in-depth characters that Christopher Nolan had projected
onto the screen ands traight into our hearts.Another reason why I&#x27;m
ex-tactic about this film, is because it shows that there still is
originality in the modern day film industry, and that there is still
hope for those people who are sick and tired of all those terrible
remakes or renditions of books that leave every bookworm upset and
ripped off.Christopher Nolan has done it again,by making a true piece
of art that is worthy enough to be placed in Louvre right next to the
Mona Lisa.I give this movie a solid 10/10, and if your waiting for the
perfect summer film...wait no longer, Inception will satisfy any desire
you would want in a movie and more.
