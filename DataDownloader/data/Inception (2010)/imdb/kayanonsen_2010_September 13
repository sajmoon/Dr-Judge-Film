What a disappointment. The idea of thought and dreams and the
subconscious being manipulated was so interesting and they took it and
made it into one of the most boring films I&#x27;ve ever seen! That I guess
was clever. <br /><br />Watching it (and listening to the overblown soundtrack trying to make
up for the utter lack of anything actually happening on the screen) was
almost as annoying as reading the overblown reviews. Is somebody&#x27;s
mother getting people to log in and say &#x22;wow&#x22;.<br /><br />It really is mind boggling that this movie was so well received. It is
long, loud, confusing, and devoid of story. Talk about a paradox.
