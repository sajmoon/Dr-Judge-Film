Upon reviewing the &#x22;Dark knight&#x22; I had said that a director such as
Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels, regardless of their quality.
And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able
to create something truly original and as such should not be adding
branches to fully grown trees.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; proves the validity of my claim, but it does so in ways
that surprised me.<br /><br />Perhaps the most immediate distinction between &#x22;Inception&#x22; and the
&#x22;Dark Knight&#x22; is an improved sense of pacing. It doesn&#x27;t feel like
narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did: despite its
scope, each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more
traditional associative cuts allow it to flow better.<br /><br />The movie itself is difficult to describe,which is a non-issue because
it requires itself to be experienced to be understood.<br /><br />Another area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors: I
always liked Leonardo DiCaprio, but his mannerisms at times can be the
thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great. In &#x22;Inception&#x22;, all
his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance ever.<br /><br />The special effects are incredibly well done, which means they don&#x27;t
look like CGI, even when they are. However, one of its greatest
technical achievements is the sound editing, perfectly balancing the
several momentums of the scenes.<br /><br />Wishing to provide no spoilers at all, I&#x27;ll just say it isn&#x27;t nearly as
complicated as some have named it, but it is a complex concept.<br /><br />I cannot compliment this movie enough. It is the most engaging film
experience I have had in a long, long, long time. My advice is don&#x27;t
miss it in the theaters. Don&#x27;t miss it when it come to DVD. Don&#x27;t miss
it any chance you get.You won&#x27;t regret it.
