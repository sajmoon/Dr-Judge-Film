2010_July 20 
Nolan seems to be on a roll.<br /><br />After the dark knight many would maybe have expected something that
didn&#x27;t quite hit the bar. Especially since we are talking only 2 years
on, where others might have taken much longer to bring the next
masterpiece.<br /><br />But Nolan doesn&#x27;t seem to do these things for the reputation, he seems
to enjoy a challenge and takes on the projects that hold something new
or different for him. And we as the audience seem to reap the benefits
in some excellent and unique experiences.<br /><br />And Inception seems to have been the best yet for me. All the hype and
secrecy around it didn&#x27;t build it up for me to a level that it was
never going to meet, and for me i was most pleased with how
uncomplicated it was. You will find many who will want to analyse this
film to death for the deeper meanings and theories that i am sure can
be drawn from this, but on even a surface level it had an excellent
script that made sense and never tried to deliberately deceive or twist
until you didn&#x27;t know where you were.<br /><br />The plot is around Dicaprio&#x27;s character Cobb, and his &#x27;job&#x27; of stealing
information from peoples dreams. He is then drawn into another job
which is much more of a challenge... the concept of implanting an idea
in someones mind through the dreamworld, or what they call &#x27;Inception&#x27;.<br /><br />To tell you more than that would be to take away the beauty of
experiencing this film on your own, but just take note that you will
need to be following the story at all times, because although things
are explained well, they aren&#x27;t hammered home (and rightly so) so as
the many layers of the film being to play out you need to be fully
alert.<br /><br />The mark of a good film is not realising the time passing, and this
film had me enthralled from beginning to end.<br /><br />A must see film for 2010, you wont be disappointed.
