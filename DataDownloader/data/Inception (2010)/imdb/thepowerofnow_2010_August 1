Apart from being a boring and absolutely stupid movie, there are some
other points that bother me. <br /><br />1) Both this movie and TDK got up to the top 5 of IMDb without any
evident reason, which makes me suspect there is a ring of &#x22;paid&#x22;
contributors bringing the movie up. Once it is off the cinema, it will
start dropping, as &#x22;real&#x22; people give the votes and not the
dream-reviewers. <br /><br />2) I actually believe in the perspective of the dead wife; the whole
reality is ultimately a dream and a creation of our own consciousness.
What bothers me is how my subconsciousness could create such a crappy
and meaningless movie.
