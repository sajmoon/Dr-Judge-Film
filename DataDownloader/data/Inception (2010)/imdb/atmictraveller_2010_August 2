I went to see Inception ready to see another Memento. Other reviews
made me believe that Inception is thought-provoking, intelligent, and
that viewing it requires constant attention. What I ended up viewing
was a movie with a decent and interesting plot-line, but with nothing
to stir my mind.<br /><br />I think the main reason people think Inception is intelligent are lots
of rules about dreaming that are at times a bit difficult to keep up
with. The difficulty in keeping up with the rules lies in their great
number - not in their complexity or innovation. All those rules are
completely arbitrary, they don&#x27;t stem from anything, cannot be reached
through reasoning and they form no grand picture. You can dream within
a dream. Time passes more slowly the deeper you go in a dream. Changing
your appearance is apparently a special skill in a dream... If Nolan
decided to go with different rules, they would still make the same
amount of sense. Most of the rules feel very contrived, their only
purpose to push the plot forward or to add to the sense of action. E.g.
Security gets tighter as you go deeper into a dream. Of course - you
need to have more action as the apex of the movie nears.<br /><br />Dreams as presented in this movie have nothing to do with real dreams.
Even aside from the contrived rules, they are way too orderly and
sensible. So I don&#x27;t get how anyone can feel thought-provoked by what
is obviously fiction. Sure, one can be amazed with the idea that we&#x27;re
living in The Matrix, because for all we know, it might be true. One
can also be amazed at the aspects of a work of fiction that pertain to
reality. But how one can be fascinated with a presentation of dreams
that we already know is incorrect is beyond me.<br /><br />Perhaps people are fascinated with the idea that what we see may not be
reality. But seriously, have you never questioned your sense of reality
before seeing this movie? <br /><br />When people say they&#x27;re thought-provoked, I think they&#x27;re confusing
their thoughts with their feelings. The movie has an air of mystery,
and viewers will get a sense of discovery as they became acquainted
with the option of entering other people&#x27;s dreams. Yet those are
feelings. What exactly is there to ponder about? Hordes of reviewers
say that they were left thinking, but few of them share with us
specific thoughts they had.<br /><br />Inception is actually a good movie. I liked a lot of scenes, and
everyone played their parts well. But if people get thought-provoked
with movies like this, it&#x27;s a sure sign of how dumbed-down we are
getting by the media.
