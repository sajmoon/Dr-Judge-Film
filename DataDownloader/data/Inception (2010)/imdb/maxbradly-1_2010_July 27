If this story was so compelling and thought provoking why was the word
dream mentioned over 800 times. The only thing this film had going for
it were the special effects which were excellent. The cast and acting
were solid but you didn&#x27;t care about any of the characters because the
story was so convoluted despite the performances. The audience which
were all SAG members were laughing at the end because it was so
ridiculous trying so hard to make sense of the impossible. Long at 140
minutes maybe okay for special effect junkies but that&#x27;s it. You wanted
so hard for the story to stimulate the mind but that was an exercise in
futility.
