It&#x27;s hard to find a movie that mixes genres so well to make a unique
hybrid. It&#x27;s hard to find a movie that&#x27;s smart enough to keep critics
nodding and fun enough to keep the casual public smiling. It&#x27;s hard to
describe this movie...only words I can find: closer to perfection than
ever inside fiction, suspense, adventure, action, drama and even
thrillers. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is one piece of a classic. I mean, like Leonardo
DiCaprio said about Scorsese, I can say about &#x22;Inception&#x22; itself (and
Christopher Nolan of course). &#x22;Inception will be like the Scream, like
La Gioconda in a distant and not to distant future&#x22;. Acting is
incredibly will directed as every actor fits perfectly for the
character. FX will keep you at the edge of your sit and be prepared to
listen to the most dramatic, strong melodies thanks to the magical mind
of Hans Zimmer. Every aspect of the film is so well taken care of that
you will get lost inside of it. The plot, oh yes, the plot...I just can
say that Christopher Nolan should win a Nobel Prize of some kind. Watch
it yourself. An instant favorite and classic. For me, much better than
the recently claimed &#x22;best movie of all time&#x22; (&#x22;The Godfather&#x22;) and
they share some aspects of genres so the comparison is valid. Only
tastes will say if it&#x27;s the best, but sure thing it&#x27;s inside the Top 5
you&#x27;ve ever seen (and yes, that includes Tarkovsky, Ozu, Welles and all
those ones you think about when thinking about &#x22;best&#x22;).
