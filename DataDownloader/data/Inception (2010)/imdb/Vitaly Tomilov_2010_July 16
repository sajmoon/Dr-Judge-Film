Another attempt at the proverbial &#x22;this is revolution of the mind&#x22; of
quite a few others, but a very good one at that, in a unique way.
Discovering or rediscovering the potential of one&#x27;s mind can be
treacherous, the maze of the subconscious web leads to many ways, it is
a narrow path between obvious and subliminal, between divine
inspiration and a mental ward. You don&#x27;t know if you can find your way
out until you have tried, and people always will, it is the last
unknown, the last milestone to crack open to see what&#x27;s inside, the
curiosity backed up by the other proverbial of &#x22;Gnothi Seauton&#x22; to
leave your mind restless, because perhaps after all that is the point.<br /><br />Watch it with good attention, and the movies settles deep into your
mind, it abates like a good smoke when you leave the cinema, creeping
on the back of your head between &#x22;Gosh, if I went there, I&#x27;d just never
come back&#x22; and &#x22;Ok, now how do I put it all together again...?&#x22;.<br /><br />Fun ride with a catch to figure out.
