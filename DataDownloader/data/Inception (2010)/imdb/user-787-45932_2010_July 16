This movie just ruined my imagination as it is so complex and
thrillingly amazing it will get on one&#x27;s mind and word as an adhesive
making you stick to the edge of your seats till you give up in front of
its elegance maturity. A wonder full screenplay and a cinematic
extravaganza. a movie to be preserved. Leonardo Di Carpio is amazing.
It is a clear ace. Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of
an idea being a crime scene. this is heck of a good thriller... good..
this is the best of the best. Kudos to Christopher Nolan for gifting us
with the following, memento, insomnia, batman begins, the prestige, the
dark knight and his best inception.
