All I can say is that I cannot get this movie out of my head. It&#x27;s as
if Christopher Nolan planted an idea in my head and it took root and
I&#x27;m wondering when I&#x27;ll wake up from this lucid dream. The last time I
can remember feeling this way about a movie was when I saw Nolan&#x27;s
other masterpiece &#x22;Memento.&#x22; This film was like a mental roller-coaster
-- simultaneously exhilarating, exhausting, thrilling and maddening.
It&#x27;s not a ride that you sit back and watch; instead, the film sucks
you in until you are immersed and disoriented (in a wonderful way) much
like the characters in the film. I emerged from the theater literally
(and I do mean &#x22;literally&#x22;) unsure of whether I might wake up in my bed
having only dreamed that I went to the movies. When I consider the
directing and editing gymnastics that were required to bring me to that
point, I&#x27;m pretty impressed to say the least. This is a film that
CANNOT be missed. I imagine that the box office will be huge for this
film because it is so compelling AND it almost demands multiple
viewings.
