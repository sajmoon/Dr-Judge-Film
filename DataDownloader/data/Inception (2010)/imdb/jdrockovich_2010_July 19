For starters I would like to say how disappointed I am with how people
can give this movie any lower than a 7 rating. I saw a few give it a 1
and let me tell you not even a Uwe Boll deserves such a grotesque
number beside it. I do believe that IMDb should set a standard score
for movie so that can&#x27;t get low and ridiculous scores.<br /><br />Now that that&#x27;s off my chest let me explain to you why this might be
one of or the greatest movies of the summer and possibly of the decade.
Knowing that Nolan created the best Batman movie in the history of film
I was for sure looking forward to this movie when it hit in theaters.
The wonderful mind of Christopher Nolan is an original one and once he
hopped off the DC Comic train and focused on a original movie with
original characters I was most certainly excited for anything he had to
throw down...and he indeed did do that.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think I need to describe the plot on here like other reviews
due to the fact that that&#x27;s what IMDb&#x27;s synopsis segment of movie pages
are all about but I will do something short and sweet for you. This
movie deals with dreams and also dreams inside of dreams and how
certain people can&#x27;t tell the difference between a dream space and
their own reality. Leo did, of course, a fantastic acting job and with
his supporters Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page there was no
stopping the degree of goodness this movie shed out.<br /><br />The look, feel, and design of Inception is elegant, beautiful, and
utterly mind blowing to say the least. The CGI visions are remarkable
but not strong enough to stray away from the exhilarating story of Cobb
and his group of dream invaders. Oh, and the story. It&#x27;s original, well
developed, and just screams for an Oscar. The dialogue was smart and
intelligent but don&#x27;t let that foul you because there were some funny
bits also.<br /><br />Altogether Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception is a marvel all in it&#x27;s own. A
real one..two.. to Hollywood. I say this with confidence because I know
this movie deserves the praise you have been hearing and I mean that
with every ligament in my body. The only people who WON&#x27;T like this
movie are probably not grasping the idea firmly or they go by the name
Armond White but still don&#x27;t sell yourself short of those people&#x27;s
opinions because they don&#x27;t display enough good details for you NOT to
see this movie.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10 <br /><br />Final Words: This movie is extraordinary in every aspect and you all
should see this one before it heads to DVD because theater seating is
where this marvelous movie should be seen full circle.
