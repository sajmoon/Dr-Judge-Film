This is the film i have been waiting for to blow me away. No film in
history has really hit me this hard before. From the director of some
other favorite films of mine such as Memento, The Prestige and the new
Batman films has made something beyond his previous works.<br /><br />Some great performances here such as Leonardo Dicaprio who plays the
Extractor, a man who intercepts other people&#x27;s dreams to access their
minds. The storyline to this movie will have you in pieces by the end.
It offers both intellectual and emotional entertainment unlike anything
made before. The visuals and visual storytelling here is magnificent as
well, being one of the few major films that overuse CGI. Is it a
technology filmmakers can sit on their ass with or is it a real
artistic tool?<br /><br />I hope from this film that it can influence more of the industry to
give us more originality because ultimately, a horrible sequel or
remake can make a lot of money but will you be paying for it in 50
years time over this?
