After watching this movie a big question got raised in my mind. &#x27;Was
AVATAR really a cinematic revolution?&#x27; The answer is a BIG NO.<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a movie that sets a new standard not just for Hollywood
but for movie makers from all the over the world. It&#x27;s a kind of movie
that can&#x27;t be explained in words and can simply be experienced (of
course with immense concentration) in order to fully understand the
depth of the story. <br /><br />I have been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan after I saw &#x27;Memento&#x27;
(another masterpiece of his) and since then have been mesmerized by his
direction and the way he narrates a story. &#x27;Memento&#x27; changed the way I
used to think about movies. &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27;(2008) was another
brilliant work that changed the way I looked at comic book heroes. And
now here comes &#x27;Inception&#x27;, a movie that not only changed the way I
think about my brain but also &#x27;planted a new idea in it&#x27;! (Christ sake
Nolan! :-O)<br /><br />Now coming to the point. I had heard from many of my friends that this
movie is too complicated to understand. Now let me get this straight to
you. YES. The movie becomes complicated at times not because of the
plot but simply because of the narration which turns out to be the best
way Nolan could have unfolded the story. If you watch movies for
spending some leisure time with your girlfriend and grabbing some
popcorn then the whole thing might go above your head. The movie
requires your full attention. In fact it challenges you to understand
the various concepts explained about dreams i.e. dreams within dreams
within dreams and so on. The whole first hour is spent in explaining
about our subconscious mind and how it works, my personal favorite
being &#x27;The Paradox&#x27;. Sounds like an overdose of knowledge rite? Not at
all. In fact you won&#x27;t even realize that the movie is more than 2 hours
in length. Action&#x85; Love&#x85; Thriller&#x85; It was a perfect mixture of&#x85; well&#x85;.
almost everything! I even witnessed a fair amount of humor.<br /><br />Next, about the star cast&#x85; well&#x85; do I need to say anything about it!
Everyone&#x85; I mean literally every single actor was very fitting in
his/her role. Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb was topnotch. He brings
genuine emotion to the scenes in which we see Cobb overwhelmed with
love for his wife and children, and he is every bit as convincing in
his action star avatar. But my favorite was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who
creates a composed, confident character that is a clever foil to
DiCaprio&#x27;s Dom Cobb.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music is haunting. Seriously, it would resonate inside
your head for at least a day or two after you&#x27;ve done watching the
movie. Editing by Lee Smith is top notch.<br /><br />And finally that brilliant and the most debated ending. Chritopher
Nolan has given us the best ending you could have ever possibly
imagined. Because it&#x27;s been a week since the movie got released and me
&#x26; my friends are still discussing about it. Jesus Christ I never
discussed so much in my life (not even for my high school project! ;-)
) I couldn&#x27;t help but stand up and applaud after that one spectacular
moment which just holds your attention and you literally beg for it to
end the way you want it to. And when it was over and the credits
rolled, a very rare thing happened in the room. The crowd inside
started cheering and applauding for what they had just witnessed. And I
have never ever ever ever seen the crowd behave like that in my entire
life. Conclusion: With Inception, Nolan fuses the core agendas of both
his previous films (Memento and The Dark Knight) &#x96; &#x22;HE IS DELIVERING A
SPECTACLE, BUT TO ENJOY IT COMPLETELY THE AUDIENCE MUST EARN IT.&#x22;
