All it takes is a viewing of the cult classic Memento to see the
Christopher Nolan is a genius auteur. What James Cameron is to visual
effects, Christopher Nolan is to storytelling. One can only imagine
what Batman 3 will bring us. One thing is for sure, Nolan has set the
bar so high that, for him to beat expectations would undoubtedly
solidify his name as one of the greatest directors in history.<br /><br />In Inception, the characters are unique, troubled, three dimensional,
mysterious, and engaging. Nolan has a knack for casting top actors in
commercially viable movies (a rarity these days as studios commonly
cast a cheap actor or model with a pretty face to partake in an action
tent pole extravaganza with one distracting explosion after another.
Somehow, Nolan is able to successfully navigate the tent pole system
in, one might argue, the exact opposite execution of one Michael Bay.
