Well, just lost for words..........The only thing that came into my
&#x22;mind&#x22; after watching this movie was WOW!. This is one of those rare
movies which succeeds on all accounts, box-office, ratings, critics and
importantly fans. It&#x27;s a movie for all ages and without a doubt one of
the movies of the decade. Hail Christopher Nolan who, i thought could
not better The Dark Knight. But he does so with masterclass and
probably even betters it. Inception grows on you with multiple
watchings, which i feel everyone should do. While watching the movie,
you just think- Do all these things happen inside my mind as
well?......... Everyone does a great job in the movie. Leo DiCaprio
gives his usual powerful performance which he does every time .Only
thing i would say is go watch this movie if you haven&#x27;t yet, well worth
the money and even more..........
