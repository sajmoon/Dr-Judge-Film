2010_December 5 
I&#x27;m going to be really short, the movie is awesome, brilliant and
surprisingly underrated! Why? Because there so many trolls even here
that try to see original ideas in movies in 2010! It&#x27;s very hard to
create something original trolls because we are in the year 2010 that
means that there are people that came up with ideas for more than 2000
years, the originality is bound to get less and less. Second how can
you not like this movie, what flee brain retarded people give this
movie one star or two or three.What morons beyond imagination say that
this movie is boring or bad. DID YOU SEE THE MOVIE OR DID YOU JUST COME
HERE TO START TROLLING. So with this I ask all the trolls to go in
their cave and leave IMDb to the more serious people who can actually
think and who actually present LOGIC in their arguments! Have a nice
day!
