Inception is an infinitely creative, original, and fascinating movie.
Once again Christopher Nolan refuses to give in to usual Hollywood
cliques and creates a brilliant screenplay as well as capturing it with
his skilled directing. From the moment I first saw the teaser trailer
for the film, I was both confused on what it was about, and excited to
find out. As well as being smart, the movie is also entertaining and
visually stunning in an equally brilliant way. The movie&#x27;s plot is very
complex from the very beginning of the film. For me, it was a bit hard
to follow, the only minor complaint I have, but I payed attention
because I actually wanted to know what was going on. The movie&#x27;s well
paced and interesting throughout. The movie is well acted, especially
Leonardo Dicaprio, and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score is one of the best Iv&#x27;e
heard in years. Inception is another reason Christopher Nolan is one of
my favorite writers in the movie industry. It&#x27;s great to see him
working in the realm of science fiction.
