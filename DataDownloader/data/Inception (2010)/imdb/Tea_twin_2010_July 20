The mind-bending qualities of this film remind the viewer that your
perception is everything. Christopher Nolan has let this concept mature
in his mind for nearly ten years. Something so carefully crafted and
matured deserves to be commended. The film&#x27;s plots, subplots and back
stories may confuse the viewer at first, but Nolan does everything he
can to make this world as clear as the dreams within it. The ensemble
cast is the most solid I have seen since The Lord of the Ring Trilogy.
They are so convincing and so into their roles. I felt so connected to
the main characters portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page. After the
film was over, the audience got up and left. We (all strangers) began
discussing the film and figuring out what it all meant. My words to a
potential viewer: do not think you are intellectually below this movie.
You will get it and what you don&#x27;t is impossible to understand. Even
Christopher Nolan could not tell you what it all means. <br /><br />My final thought... I am reluctant to pay to see movies, especially at
non-matin&#xE9;e price. I jumped right on this film and it was entirely
worth it. Favorite Film of the Summer.<br /><br />10/10 Stars. Two Thumbs Up. Hey Mikey, He Likes It!
