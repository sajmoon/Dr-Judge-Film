What a disappointment! This movie is a technically good heist movie
wrapped in a dream plot, that is boring like hell! The dreams look
almost exactly like the reality and during the whole movie constantly
somebody is shooting, running or escaping! <br /><br />Christoper Nolan outdoes himself in taking almost all the inspiring and
challenging aspects away from an interesting idea! He strings together
one exhausting action sequence after an other without any creativity or
a fresh, new approach regarding the exploration of dreams! <br /><br />The further you delve into the dream levels, the more you get bored by
more spiritless action. At the end i thought: oh, perhaps i missed the
point and this is the next James Bond movie and they deliberately left
away in the title the 007 to open up a further, contrived dimension.
Very tricky! <br /><br />This movie is so overrated, that it hurts. Inception looks like an
intelligent, complex movie - that is what it wants to be - but it is
only a dull action flick without any character development or
intellectual aspiration. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan perhaps knows to impress technically but he fails
completely to let me really care about his protagonists and the
storyline. Technical perfection, the use of visual and special effects
and an allegedly complex story can&#x27;t substitute the lack of real
vision, creativity and good character development! That&#x27;s the
difference between Inception and a masterpiece.
