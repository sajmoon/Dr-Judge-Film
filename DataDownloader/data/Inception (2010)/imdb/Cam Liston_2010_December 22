Very, very overrated film. Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual
effects but would never buy the DVD. The acting is good but the content
lacks a truly engaging story line. It lures you in but never manages to
hook you. They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb. It
seems to me as though the film could&#x27;ve been pulled off with a less
talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts.
Other parts are way too predictable. This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film
people talk it up to be. Those people out there who say this is a GREAT
film are mistaken. Although in saying that it stills scores a solid
5/10. Cam
