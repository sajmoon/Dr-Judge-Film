This movie is way too talky and confusing to enjoy. Add to that a
director/writer with absolutely zero sense of humor and wit, and we are
left with this dry onslaught on your senses. I think Mr Nolan may have
brains and be some people&#x27;s cup of tea, but his humorless and
emotionless films have all left me extremely disappointed. INCEPTION in
particular was torture for me. There is absolutely no payoff by the end
of the film because we do not care about any of these characters. If it
were not for the genius score, this could easily be the worst waste of
time I have had in a movie theater in years.<br /><br />I see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the
rave reviews are coming from. It&#x27;s possible that there are many who do
love this film. But they weren&#x27;t in our packed audience. One person
clapped at film&#x27;s end, and it quickly died when no one joined in.
Instead most people bolted for the doors after this overlong dud.
