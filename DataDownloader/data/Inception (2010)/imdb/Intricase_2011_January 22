OK, so here is the deal. You can read thousands of epic movie reviews
in which you&#x27;ll find flip flop ideas on why or why not this is the best
movie ever made, worth watching or worth denying. But honestly, what
brings a movie home is the idea that there will be a day again when you
will want to actually pick the same movie up again and be entertained.<br /><br />So, after my prologue I pray that you will find this as part of an
in-depth list I will post on as movies that you should own.<br /><br />Inception is the least of your worries when deciding which movie to add
to your library of all time best movies that you will watch over and
over. Now i know a lot of you will stick this movie next to &#x22;Happy
Gilmore&#x22; and &#x22;Legally Blonde II&#x22; and that is fine because it&#x27;s the
entertainment value we are looking for. Not the &#x22;Macho Movie Buff&#x22;
critic collection. We are not artists and we are not Poets, we only
yearn to be entertained and so you will with the money you use buying
this piece of entertainment. If you can&#x27;t handle how complex the movie
is then you will find comfort in a few more of my picks.<br /><br />Hope this helps in your quest to beef up that Library.<br /><br />-E&#x27;dom
