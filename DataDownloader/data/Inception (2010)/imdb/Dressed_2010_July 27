I have never seen such nonsense in my life.<br /><br />The plot are interesting, and they don&#x27;t manage to do anything better
out of it then this?<br /><br />To be honest I did not get the big point, if there ever was any. I
rather suggest they just filled the movie up with lots of strange
happenings, serious faces, hype and noise to make it look interesting.<br /><br />Are they empty for ideas in Hollywood? To call movies like this,
District 9 and Avatar really good and among top 10 is a joke. 10 years
ago such movies would be nothing, and get no more then a cult status.
At its best.<br /><br />I will never watch this crap again, sorry..
