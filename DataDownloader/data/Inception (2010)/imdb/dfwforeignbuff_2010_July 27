Christopher Nolan gave us the 2001 indie breakthrough Memento.
Supposedly he spent 10 years writing this screenplay/plot for this
dreamscape movie. (KIND OF A Matrix 2010)In this new film director
tosses off more ideas &#x26; plot devices most blockbusters would never had
the nerve to attempt. Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in
the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep
within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its
most vulnerable. Cobb&#x27;s rare ability has made him a coveted player in
this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made
him an international fugitive &#x26; cost him everything he has ever loved.
Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could
give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the
impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb &#x26; his team of
specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an
idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.
But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for
the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy
that only Cobb could have seen coming. Christopher Nolan is one of
Hollywood&#x27;s most inventive dreamers/directors. Inception Is very
clever. Concentrating on the procedural details of mind crime this is a
devilishly intricate yarn set in the layers of the subconscious. Nolan
gives a heist thriller for the surreal. That challenges film goers to
unravel &#x26; understand multiple layers of (un)reality. Film has
exceptional cinematography set designs &#x26; special effects. Film give a
simulation of fake reality intended to seduce us, mess up our heads &#x26;
leave a lasting impression. Film is a success but much of the time
viewers are lost &#x26; disoriented. In the age of remakes &#x26; sequels &#x26;
franchises. Inception does a difficult thing&#x97;it is completely &#x26;
uniquely original. Highest rating you might need to see this movie
twice
