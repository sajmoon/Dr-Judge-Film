This is a movie that you must see, and must see on the big screen.
Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character is dark and sneaky, and is really
convincing. Ellen Page is sweet and compassionate, this is the best
role she&#x27;s ever played. But the actor that I really loved in this movie
is Tom Hardy. If this movie were to ever be followed up, I would
strongly hope that the next movie would focus on Tom Hardy&#x27;s character.
He&#x27;s edgy, witty, and epically bad-ass. <br /><br />When you do see this movie, I warn you that the first twenty minutes or
so are very confusing. It&#x27;s frustrating, even. However, after a while
the film retroactively explains itself, and at the end you&#x27;ll love it,
I promise.
