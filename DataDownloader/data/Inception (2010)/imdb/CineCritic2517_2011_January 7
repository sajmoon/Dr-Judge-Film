2011_January 7 
I don&#x27;t know what it is about this movie that people get so carried
away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some
younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and
boring as I did.<br /><br />I read that people find this movie&#x27;s complexity to be one of its strong
points. This is quite sad since it&#x27;s about as complex as the basis of
your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard
to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity
in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own
intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect
namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like
when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going
on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn&#x27;t
even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn&#x27;t already all
too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.<br /><br />The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and
the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be
its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn&#x27;t really make the
viewer care for it&#x27;s outcome since such is already pretty clear because
Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty
damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns,
some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular
scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a
snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what
appears to be 007&#x27;s stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two
trees.<br /><br />Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced
with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it
was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way
too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled.
Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film
length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who
can&#x27;t tell, and couldn&#x27;t care less to be able to tell, sh&#xEF;t from
Shinola. <br /><br />5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound
editing.
