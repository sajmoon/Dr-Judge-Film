Inception is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and
surprisingly most of my favorites are directed by Christopher Nolan,
starting with Memento till Dark Knight I am huge fan and Inception is
no exception, its is a master piece, and I know just like other movies
of Christopher Nolan this one will be considered as one of the top
movies of all time.<br /><br />Inception is a story of inception of a thought in someone&#x27;s mind and
believe me everyone who is going to watch this movie will have an idea
actually in there minds as well, I have the same kind of felling when I
watched Memento, this movie creates effects like the same, the strange
felling of watching something new or unique.<br /><br />Been waiting for this movie for almost 7 months now, biggest movie of
the year and I am sure will win all the awards at the Oscars and
another place where it will be nominated.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is quite amazing , he told such a complex story in
just 2 hrs, if Matrix&#x27;s Brothers were have to same kind of thing, they
would have taken 3 movies to tell the same story, it just Nolan who can
manage such a complex story to be tolled in just one movie, Oh wow what
an experience, I hope Christopher Nolan will make a sequel or prequel
of the same with same brilliance.<br /><br />Must watch for everyone, and should watch it for more than once.<br /><br />Thanx AB
