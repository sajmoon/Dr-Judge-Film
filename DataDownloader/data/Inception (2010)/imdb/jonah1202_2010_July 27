Christopher Nolan has achieved something remarkable here. <br /><br />A summer blockbuster action/thriller that isn&#x27;t a patchwork of CGI
effects held together by a tenuous plot allied to insubstantial
character development like so many other offerings we&#x27;ve had to endure
this year.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not a tired sequel, a merchandise tie-in or a TV series spin-off.<br /><br />Instead, it&#x27;s a stunningly refreshing vision of the journey into the
subconscious. True, it&#x27;s been done before but never like this.<br /><br />Alternative reality / mind journey films (Matrix, Total Recall,
eXistenZ, Dark City etc.) have explored this area but not to the same
effect. Obviously, it doesn&#x27;t appeal to everyone but even the naysayers
can&#x27;t deny that, at times, the film contains some of the most
exhilarating action sequences ever seen. <br /><br />To be honest, the Matrix left me cold but Inception has real emotional
depth. <br /><br />Here&#x27;s the paradox. It succeeds partly because it&#x27;s both the apotheosis
and antithesis of the summer movie. It engages, thrills, intrigues,
immerses and requires the viewer to invest in some cerebral gymnastics.
Ultimately, it&#x27;s such a resounding success because it rewards the
audience for staying with it, for buying into the concept.<br /><br />The pay-off is immense.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a &#x27;must see&#x27; movie and it restores your faith in what cinema can
achieve. If cinema it exists to challenge you, to take you on a journey
and create a sense of wonder, then this is cinema in its most
awe-inspiring form.<br /><br />You emerge from the theatre with the feeling that you&#x27;ve just been
somewhere extraordinary and it will live with you for days afterwards.<br /><br />&#x22;Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?&#x22; Essential
viewing.
