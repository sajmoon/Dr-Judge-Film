Christopher Nolan&#x27;s ambitious latest project Inception has bravely
arrived on the back of his hugely successful previous project &#x27;The Dark
Knight&#x27; (2008) sensationally undeterred by the ensuing sky-high
expectations, but perhaps its timing isn&#x27;t quite as troublesome as one
might think. Dark Knight was ultimately the typical superhero m&#xE9;lange
single-handedly heaved to greatness by a mind-blowing Heath Ledger who
nobody else could keep up with, in more ways than one: it was a vehicle
for an exceptional talent rather than a legendary masterpiece in
itself; whereas Inception has all senses engaged and all aspects finely
tuned.<br /><br />The lush smorgasbord of rich themes infinitely beguiling concepts &#x96;
dreams, memory, thoughts and feelings and other psychological notions &#x96;
provide a highly engaging premise for a film that is unlike any other.
Of course, as in all big-budget blockbusters, larger than life action
sequences abound like huge flashy bedazzling numbers in a musical. Also
like the songs in a tuneful stage show, a few of them are unwelcome,
and many of the later climactic displays of spectacle are painfully
long for the audience&#x27;s attention span: but slackening the pace in this
manner is mostly beneficial, giving us time to contemplate and
comprehend the great jigsaw puzzle that is the plot.<br /><br />Amidst the surreal swirl of slightly sci-fi-esquire ideas, a handful of
pleasingly memorable characters shape a respectably well-conceived
story. Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Agent Cobb, a world-weary and
suspiciously enigmatic man who is desperate to complete a job in order
to go home to his dearly missed children; the job falls into place in
the category of the strangest kind of espionage: dream invasion. The
reason for his puzzling particularly secretive nature appears to be
connected to his eerily mysterious late wife Mal (a stunningly
disturbing Marion Cotillard) whose ghostly memory makes recurring
appearances in the dreams he enters. Di Caprio is joined by a splendid
ensemble of mostly unrecognised actors &#x96; most notably Ellen Page, Tom
Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt &#x96; who play his trusted colleagues in
this rather insane endeavour.<br /><br />See it for the intrigue, the effects and the incomparable dynamics of
Cotillard, Di Caprio and all the others.
