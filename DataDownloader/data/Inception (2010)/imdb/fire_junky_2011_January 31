I just watched inception for the first time without any previous
knowledge of what the movie was about, who was in it, or even when it
was made. I don&#x27;t know how I missed hearing about this movie. I am so
amazed and stunned by what I just watched that its almost hard to
concentrate. When the credits started rolling I couldn&#x27;t breath.
Utterly dumbfounded. Maybe the best movie I have ever seen. My favorite
movies to date are Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,
and Waking Life. This movie fits perfectly into this list. If this
movie doesn&#x27;t blow your mind then you might not have one. All I can say
about this is it is truly best if you can watch this movie without
watching the trailer first. Pure beauty.
