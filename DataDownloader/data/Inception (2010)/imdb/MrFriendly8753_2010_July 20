I&#x27;ll go ahead and say that I am a huge Chris Nolan fan, but still went
into this open-minded without letting my biases affect the viewing.
Having said that and being as objectionable as possible...<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has cemented himself as one of the best filmmakers
out there with this one. This is a film that in the hands of a lesser
director could have ended up a muddled mess, but instead ends up being
a beautiful work of cinema.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s tight direction means that a twisty story ends up making pretty
good sense (cries of &#x22;It&#x27;s too difficult to understand!&#x22; are
overrated). I&#x27;ll abstain from giving plot details because it would
basically mean having to explain the entire film to give context.<br /><br />Beyond Nolan&#x27;s direction and having this idea for a film to begin with,
Team Nolan returns with perhaps their best work yet. The cinematography
is fantastic, Hans Zimmer has one of his better scoring efforts, and
the editing contributes to helping keep the story flowing and making
sense despite it&#x27;s somewhat-confusing nature. Props to all.<br /><br />And finally, the terrific ensemble. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Leonardo
DiCaprio but respect his work, especially post-&#x27;Titanic&#x27;. Here he
knocks it out of the park in the lead role, surrounded by a fantastic
ensemble. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy are the two big standouts
(Gordon-Levitt needs to be the lead in a film like this, he&#x27;s that good
an actor, and I know agree with other reviews I&#x27;ve read, Tom Hardy
should be the next James Bond after Daniel Craig is done).<br /><br />All in all, this film has redeemed the worst summer of film perhaps
ever (sans this and &#x27;Toy Story 3&#x27;) and hopefully will send a message to
Hollywood that the general public doesn&#x27;t just want recycled garbage.
Now let&#x27;s all go see it again to reinforce that idea!
