Alright. I know that this movie is getting rave reviews, but after
seeing it last night I am wondering why!? I saw a preview for this
about 2 months ago and had been wanting to see it ever since. Geez,
what a letdown once I finally saw it. Unfortunately, I can not think of
one good thing to say about this movie. I was lost as to what was going
on only after 5 minutes into this and it kept getting more complicated.
I was expecting this movie to be on the weird side, but it made no
sense to me whatsoever. I don&#x27;t think I have ever wanted to walk out of
a movie so much in my life. The only thing that kept me staying was the
hope that this movie would pick up. It&#x27;s 2 1/2 hours long and trust me,
it feels like that and more! It&#x27;s just rather dull. Nothing really
going on, the effects are just OK...nothing to really save the movie.
It didn&#x27;t hold my interest, didn&#x27;t keep me on the edge of my seat
wondering what would happen next, there was no wow factor, nothing.
Huge disappointment.
