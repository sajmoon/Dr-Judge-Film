Inception is one of these mind-warping, complex action/sci-fi movies
that end up becoming very popular, like the Matrix. Only this film was
a little bit more successful when it came to the box office.
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s genius screen writing allowed him to create this
film that wowed me and a lot of people around me in the theater. Cobb
(Leonardo DiCaprio) is a some kind of dream weaver or &#x22;thief&#x22; who, with
his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) go into peoples dreams and
acquire important information that is relevant to their mission. But
this time, he&#x27;s not taking, he&#x27;s planting. Cobb realizes that if he can
perform Inception, than it might be his ticket home. While he has his
dead wife causing problems on his missions, he also has Robert Fischer
(Cillian Murphy) who he needs to plant a single idea within that
persons sub- conscience to make it feel as if its was his own. I have
heard some negative reviews, including one by Leonard Maltin. A critic
I respect, but his review seemed to be focused on the fact of how
complicated it is. Many other critics have said its to complex and hard
to follow. Really, these are one of those movies where you really need
to pay attention and you&#x27;ll get it. I don&#x27;t know what Leonard and other
critics were doing, but I stayed focused and I got everything that was
going on. This is probably one of the best movies of the year and will
definitely be showing up at the Oscars. Go see it if you haven&#x27;t. 10/10
