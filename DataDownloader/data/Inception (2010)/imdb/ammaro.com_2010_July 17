2010_July 17 
I haven&#x27;t done a &#x27;movie review&#x27; in a while, basically because we&#x27;ve had
quite a lot of rubbish recently. Well, either rubbish, or clich&#xE9;s. Gone
are the day&#x27;s of the 90&#x27;s, with great movies that were actually
intelligent, like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Sixth Sense, and so on. Now
all we seem to get is more of the same dumbed down movies, over and
over again, and so on for the past decade (sure, there have been a few
good movies here and there, but that&#x27;s all they are, a &#x27;few&#x27;).<br /><br />This year seems to have made a comeback, though; is this decade going
to be a good one for movies? Shutter&#x27;s Island at the beginning of the
year with it&#x27;s crazy multiple psychological twist, trailers for Salt
showing a clever WTF plot line, and just yesterday, Inception.<br /><br />Wow. It&#x27;s not often I sit and watch a movie in the cinema gripping the
edge of my seat, dreadfully anticipating the next few seconds. Not
often that a movie ends and everyone in the cinema starts clapping.<br /><br />So what is this Inception business? Well, to actually review the movie
without spoilers is kinda tough, and even though it&#x27;s kind of immune to
spoilers (telling you the ending would not take away from the story, as
it&#x27;s the point of &#x27;how they got there&#x27;, and even if I tell you &#x27;how
they got there&#x27; it would probably make you more confused) so if you
haven&#x27;t watched it yet, read until the ---Spoilers--- tag below. The
movie has a cast that basically drove it to perfection; Michael Caine,
Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Marion Cotillard, and stars the lovely Leonardo
DiCaprio, who got famous from the cheesy &#x22;I&#x27;m the King of the World&#x22;
scene in Titanic (well, that and getting it on with Kate Winslet in the
back of a steamy car). Let&#x27;s just say back then he was a little, what&#x27;s
the word, soft.<br /><br />But over the years, he&#x27;s gone from some young and pansy romantic actor
into my top 10 list (along with Al Pacino, De Niro, Brad Pitt, etc),
and again that&#x27;s partly through his mind blowing performances in movies
that again, blow your mind; from Gangs of New York, to The Departed, to
the recent Shutter&#x27;s Island, and now this? I must say, we&#x27;re far off
from that little kid back in Titanic.<br /><br />Inception is basically about dreams, how you can actually enter
someone&#x27;s dreams (through a physical connection while you both sleep),
and from there steal hidden ideas and thoughts from their subconscious.
DiCaprio plays an expert thief at that game, and along the way is
forced to take a pretty tough mission (details of which I can&#x27;t
discuss, see spoiler part below).<br /><br />The acting was high quality, graphics amazing without making it seem
over-done, and the plot-line way above anything you&#x27;ve seen in theatres
over the past few years. This being said, it&#x27;s not a movie most people
won&#x27;t get, but if you are a dumb viewer who can&#x27;t grasp more than your
typical straightforward storyline, don&#x27;t bother watching this. I
counted at least 8 people leaving the cinema half way through the
movie. Many others would probably want to watch this a second time due
to the complexity and number of levels this movie hits.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve always had a fascination with dreams, and how the dream world
works in comparison to the real world; dreams within dreams, the time
aspect of it, controlling your own dreams, or even being aware that
you&#x27;re actually in a dream - I wrote about this a while back, read it
here (http://www.ammaro.com/2007/08/dreams-reality.html) <br /><br />It does raise multiple questions about your life, dreams, what is real
and what isn&#x27;t. I would go as far as say that it brings about that same
feeling you get when you first watched &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;. Everything in the
real world seems kind of blurry for a while. And this movie makes you
think, oh yes it makes you think. I couldn&#x27;t find much to fault with
it, except that even though the whole thing lasts about two and a half
hours, I felt a few parts were rushed, and probably needed a little
more development, while others dragged on a little. Overall, this
didn&#x27;t deter much from the enjoyment, I give this a 9/10, a definite
must watch and so far the best movie of the year! <br /><br />Continued with spoilers at
