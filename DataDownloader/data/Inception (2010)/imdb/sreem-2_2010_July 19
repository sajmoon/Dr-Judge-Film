&#x22;Inception&#x22; is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s best work till date , a notch up
over Memento. This movie will blow away all your thoughts. Nolan like
the mission of our main lead in the movie will secretly implant an
everlasting movie experience in the deeper layers of your mind by the
end of the Movie. <br /><br />Power of mind in dreams is Inexplicable ! if you have ever thought so
before , watching this movie will teach what can be done with your mind
while dreaming. <br /><br />Though the idea of entering someone else dream may be fictional for now
but if it ever achieved in future &#x22;Inception&#x22; will be first book to
