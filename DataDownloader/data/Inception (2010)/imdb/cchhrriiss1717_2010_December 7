The only reasons you wouldn&#x27;t rate this movie a ten out of ten is: 1.
You simply didn&#x27;t understand it. OR.. 2. You refused to ever give the
movie a chance. And are a rebel against amazing works of art and want
to spoil the enjoyment of others...<br /><br />But<br /><br />It is a very fast paced movie and is quite annoying to watch with
people who cant follow movies very well, because you will find yourself
having to pause the movie every ten minutes to try and explain whats
going on with out giving anything away.<br /><br />Other than that.....<br /><br />It was the best and most original movie i&#x27;ve seen in years!
