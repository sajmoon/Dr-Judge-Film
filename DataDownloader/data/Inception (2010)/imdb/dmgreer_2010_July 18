Inception was okay, it was well produced and directed and kept my
attention throughout, so that&#x27;s why I give it a 7 instead of a 6.<br /><br />Having seen the trailer, I went into it expecting a mind bending movie
with a dreamlike script, but instead it&#x27;s basically a puzzle movie with
lots of run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up action. You do leave the movie with
a heightened sense of awareness, but not with a different viewpoint on
the world.<br /><br />I never cared that much for any of the characters, which is unusual for
me - I often end up crying or otherwise being involved, so in that
respect Inception seemed rather shallow. I kept trying to generate
care, waiting for the arc of the script to take me over into the next
level, but that point in the script never came.<br /><br />Technically, the special effects are pretty good, though they&#x27;re kind
of a one trick pony, or maybe a two trick pony. I was expecting much
more in this regard. Sure, when I&#x27;m in a dream it seems real to my
mind, but there are usually some really strange aspects too, like
people whose faces are unclear, or like trying to speak but not being
able, or like changing geography, or really weird, crazy stuff. None of
this kind of thing happens in Inception, except for the occasional
alteration in gravity.<br /><br />The basic idea, of never being sure what&#x27;s real or what&#x27;s constructed
in your mind, has been done before. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that,
since it&#x27;s impossible to come up with new ideas about the human
condition. But Rod Serling wrote some more compelling 30 minute TV
scripts on the subject many years ago.<br /><br />My review makes it sound like a bad movie, which it is not, it&#x27;s good
enough. I guess I&#x27;m just reacting to incredible hype of people who
think it&#x27;s the greatest movie ever made. It certainly does not deserve
a 9.4 rating, which is what IMDb is giving it as of this writing.
