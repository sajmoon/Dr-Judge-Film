I went to watch it last night at a local Kino in Berlin motivated by
the high rating this movie has in this same website. I was actually
expecting something good, we were talking about Blade Runner (our
benchmark) before watching it, dreaming it could get anywhere close to
it. We were wrong The first 20 minutes of the film were OK, but after
that the film revealed itself to be no more than a fast paced
video-clip action film. The script is OK but has quite many flaws, the
dialogs are so bad most of the time. It&#x27;s like everything is not
natural and the characters are forced to explain things and as we say
in Spanish they use a shoehorn so the audience doesn&#x27;t get lost I
suppose. Nevertheless what they do is not that hard to understand and
they could have simply done it in a way more clever way. The acting is
extremely weak, if you are looking for the di Caprio from the aviator,
departed, so on, forget about this film. I guess Leonardo did what he
could with this piece of crap script they gave him. If this wasn&#x27;t
enough, the film has music playing behind almost the entire film, very
common among the sci-fi action films of our time, maybe it&#x27;s me, but I
cannot stand techno music or whatever during the entire film. I guess
you know what I mean. And last, the action, it has more action than
needed. the last 45 minutes I was literally yawning and wouldn&#x27;t have
minded to leave the cinema. It was awful, gunshots, grenades, kicks and
punches.... simply pathetic. Im sorry for Nolan, he made memento which
is a great film and Dark Knight was also good, but this?&#xBF; this is crap
and if you like sci- fi and quality, waiting for a DVD release should
be enough. What Im afraid is that all those 10 rating votes are from
young people or something, who haven&#x27;t seen much sci-fi or just think
this is what sci-fi is supposed to be, nothing more distant from
reality.
