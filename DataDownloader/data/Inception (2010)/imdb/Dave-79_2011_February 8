I actually liked this film a lot; I like Christopher Nolan&#x27;s stuff.
&#x22;Memento&#x22; was stellar. And although there are many plot holes,
contradictions, and other bits of carelessness in the filmmaking
process, it&#x27;s still a visually stunning experience -- one that led me
to watch it several times. Also, it helps to turn on the DVD&#x27;s
subtitles in order to discern what the heck Saito is saying during
several key scenes.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t get too hung up on trivial inconsistencies because the movie
moves along at a lively pace. To paraphrase Ariadne, it&#x27;s more about
the feel.<br /><br />OK, so if you&#x27;re in the middle of a dream, and &#x22;an extremely powerful
sedative&#x22; is being used, you end up in limbo if you get killed.
However, because Yusuf tailored the sedative to leave inner ear
function unimpaired, the falling-to-your-death sensation will still
wake you up even if you&#x27;re many layers deep. So why didn&#x27;t they just
drop Saito if they were worried about losing him to limbo? Oh, and if
you&#x27;ve never been in limbo before, you automatically end up in the
infinite depths of the subconscious world of one of your co-dreamers
who might&#x27;ve been there before. In other words, let&#x27;s just make stuff
up and call it good.<br /><br />Nevertheless, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is still a nifty flick with plenty of cool
visuals to keep you interested. It&#x27;s a fun ride.
