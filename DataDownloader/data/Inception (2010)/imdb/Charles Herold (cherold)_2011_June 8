It took me a while to get around to seeing this movie, and when I
started watching it I realized that I had no idea what it was about. I
had never read a review of any sort. I&#x27;d just heard it was a mind trip
from the guy who did Memento, and that was the reason I wanted to watch
it.<br /><br />While this isn&#x27;t a movie where not knowing what it&#x27;s about would really
heighten the experience the way it would with something like The Truman
Show, I would say the ideal way to watch it is to stop reading reviews
and just watch it. I&#x27;m also not going to say a thing about the story.<br /><br />That being said, this is an amazing movie. It has a fairly original
premise, it is exciting and suspenseful and intricately plotted. The
special effects are amazing. The characters are well thought out
(except, perhaps for one characters inexplicable decision to get more
immersed than necessary or advisable) and its mix of psychology and
pondering on the nature of reality is fascinating.<br /><br />It&#x27;s the sort of movie that, at the end, makes you wonder, &#x22;did that
really all make sense?&#x22; Fortunately the website screenrant has a
wonderful analysis that makes it clear that yes, this really does all
hold together pretty well.<br /><br />A beautifully designed, extravagantly clever, wildly entertaining
movie. Watch it.
