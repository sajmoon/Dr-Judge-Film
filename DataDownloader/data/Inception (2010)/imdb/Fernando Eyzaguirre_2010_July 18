Nolan has crafted a perfect film from what has to be one of the most
complex, head-ache inducing scripts. I had a feeling that Nolan would
really create something special after The Dark Knight, but I had no
idea of the magnitude of marvel in which he would delve in. This film
is too smart to be a summer movie but Nolan has somehow (over the
course of 10 years) woven sensational action sequences, astonishing set
pieces, and brushes with dreamscapes through dominantly practical
special effects. The story acts as a complicated labyrinth, with Nolan
letting you find your own way out. Truly a sight to behold! All the
actors give the dreamworld such immersible feeling that you can&#x27;t help
but invest in all of the characters.
