A blockbuster, star studded extravaganza with a somewhat imaginative
yet an overwhelmingly more confusing and contrived premise. The
audience is expected to enter this contrived sci-fi?, dream world where
Juno is able to architect dreams (why her character I didn&#x27;t pick up),
and Leo&#x27;s character can extract information or do the more complicated
thing of putting an idea into someones mind &#x22;inception&#x22;. Continuously
saturated with fun, &#x22;A&#x22;list actors one after another; Leo, Michael
Caine, Juno, Joseph Gordan-Levitt, Ken Watanabe these actors were used
as mere tools to create a blockbuster and drive the movie forward. As
we get more and more immersed in the world of inception we feel no
interesting characterizations despite all this acting talent, everyone
is one tone, which makes you care less whether or not Leo is still
dreaming at the end or not. After this matrixy like premise is
explained, we are transported into this world, of entering and altering
people&#x27;s subconscious in dreamland. It has similar overtones to the
Matrix (of heavily explaining ulterior worlds within our own), but this
premise was far less fascinating.<br /><br />After the complicated premise is established the movie gets into the
story. Leo has powers to extract information or alter someone&#x27;s
thinking by entering another individual&#x27;s subconscious dreamworld. He
gets an assignment from a powerful mogul to exploit and alter a
competitor&#x27;s mind through his dream. If Leo succeeds he gets to travel
back to the states where he has been deported. The movie did not do a
good job connecting the premise of how people enter dreams and plant
ideas to the story. OK so this idea of conducting inception in dream
world is established but does it have to get into 3-4 dream sequences?
Its more complicated to do inception than steal info out of someones
mind so something more has to be done than getting into people&#x27;s minds
on one level but confusingly layering dreams within dreams within
dreams, confusing establishing various rules with this more complicated
inception world (I barely understood the easier stealing info world),
confusingly adding side stories of his wife he doesn&#x27;t want to let go
of and therefore retains in his personal dream and making confusing
action and fighting (who they are fighting is also part of the puzzle)
made it much too much. These things are actually explained but they are
explained so briefly and rapidly along with many other &#x22;rules&#x22; we have
to accept that it became a lot, easy to miss and not well put together. <br /><br />More than imagination it was randomness....Why 3 levels why not 8 or 2
why does it have to be 3 levels (the movie I think explained this but
what Im critical of is the imaginative part, it was just too random to
get really into), if Juno can flip the grid of Paris why cant she do
something to make it easy for them to accomplish their goal. The
limitations or freedoms were not clear. What it utlimately came down to
was an action movie. Definitely after a second viewing the pieces may
more clearly fit, but for me at least, the puzzle will remain askew.
