Long, BORING, never-ending! In 15 minutes you do not care who and why
in this or that reality...<br /><br />You cannot even sleep there- too noisy... TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND
MONEY!!! Tasteless chewing-gum... Almost as disappointing as Shutter
Island (that was at least shorter)... DiCaprio is protecting wild
nature or not eating meat - it&#x27;s OK...<br /><br />But to take part in those incredible boring to death movies - it&#x27;s
really a failure... You come to see something really extraordinary -
but - again and again - kinda art-house with visual effects - AND
DISGUSTINGLY LONG AND BORING!!!
