i am a relatively young person so i guess you could say that my
cinematic background is not by any means impressive, despite that
however i am still able to recognize this movie as a not only
masterfully directed film, but also as a ridiculously well written
screen play. I say it is well written and well directed because of the
various appeals that this movie holds for audiences. For those who are
looking for a bang bang shoot &#x27;em up type movie this will movie will
do, what with its unimaginable action sequences and extraordinarily
well done cg animation (that while being completely unbelievable is not
overdone to the point of looking like a video game). That is not its
only appeal however, this possesses that which the film industry
currently lacks, a fully functioning, well developed plot that will not
only intrigue, but ultimately satisfy the audience in ways that Michael
bay films do not. if you are looking for the must watch movie of the
summer i am very comfortable in saying that this movie is, if not the
#1(unlikely that it wont be), is at the very least in the top 3
