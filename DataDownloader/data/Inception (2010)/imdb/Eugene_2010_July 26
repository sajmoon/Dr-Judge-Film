I read the reviews for this movie, asked my friends about it and
decided to take a look. After about 45 minutes into it I found myself
sorely disappointed with the acting, the story progression, and the
development of the characters (no genuine or believable character
development, other than the obvious and predictable growth of
DiCaprio). <br /><br />Watanabe, Page, and Gordon-Levitt demonstrated some of the poorest
acting I&#x27;ve seen since Con Air. Watanabe was difficult to understand
90% of the time. Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s attempt to portray a cool &#x26; steely
partner was grossly unbelievable. Page came across aggravating and, in
many ways, out of place. <br /><br />The Bottom-line: I believe that the movie did a good job of hypnotizing
everyone into thinking that the Matrix want-to-be story was deep or
intriguing. <br /><br />Please don&#x27;t waste your time seeing this movie.
