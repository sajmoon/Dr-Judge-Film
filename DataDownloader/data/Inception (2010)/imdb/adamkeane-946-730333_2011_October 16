I&#x27;d Like to start by saying that I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I
loved The Dark Knight And Memento, but I am afraid that this film
dropped well below my expectations.This film is filled to the brim with
special effects but lacks the substance.If you pay enough attention to
follow this car crash of a storyline by the end you&#x27;ll wished you
hadn&#x27;t bothered.The only thing that saves this film is the acting
performances and the special effects, which at times can even make you
dizzy. So I am afraid this film is an absolute, catastrophic and
undoubtedly definite disappointment. Do yourself a favour and watch
something else.
