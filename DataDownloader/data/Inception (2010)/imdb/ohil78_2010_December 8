i was really excited about the release of this when i watched it on the
big screen i enjoyed it but it wasn&#x27;t the prestige or momento it was
similar to the matrix i was expecting the Nolan twist but this didn&#x27;t
happen there was mixed messages through out the film i.e Michael cane
&#x27;when will you come back to reality&#x27; maybe i got it wrong but i don&#x27;t
think he was in a dream in a dream in a dream but i think Nolan lost
himself a bit in this one it is a good film very good but not the best
id be happier to see a Nolan film with a 5 million dollar budget and i
think he&#x27;ll pull a masterpiece of with it brilliant films can be made
with small budgets i don&#x27;t claim too be a film critic this is just an
opinion
