I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at
the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De
Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which
surely does have some psychological connection with this movie
in&#x27;playing with our minds&#x27;. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I
couldn&#x27;t really follow &#x27;Inception&#x27; and as a native Englishman, I am
still unsure as to the meaning of the word &#x27;Inception&#x27; for the context
of the film.<br /><br />The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but
fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is &#x27;not&#x27; Bourne
Supremacy&#x27; or &#x27;Salt&#x27; and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in
the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when
watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film
and couldn&#x27;t, so I became frustrated.<br /><br />Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen
Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for
her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure
for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh
dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly
forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of
the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of
movies like &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; while watching it. Why oh why did the director
have to &#x27;overcook&#x27; this movie.<br /><br />We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies
with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and
rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the
mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through
directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.<br /><br />Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see,
sorry!
