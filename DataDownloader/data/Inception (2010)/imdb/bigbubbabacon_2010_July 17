There are quite a films in theaters that you can go see right now. But
Inception is the only one that you need to see.<br /><br />Inception is a brilliant piece of film-making. It shows Nolan&#x27;s ability
to handle multi-layered subjects without losing control of himself or
the film. The story is told in a whirlwind, nonstop manner but without
sacrificing intelligence for all of the flair and style. You will be on
the edge of your seat from the word go and you will remain there long
after the movie is over.<br /><br />At the time of writing it is 11:15 at night. My showing of the movie
ended at 9:28. I&#x27;m still thinking about this film. In fact, the only
other film that has ever stuck with me like this was also directed by
Christopher Nolan: The Prestige. The Prestige, in fact, is my favorite
movie of all time.<br /><br />Or it was. Inception tops it in every way. Where The Prestige is slow
and methodical, Inception is a lightening joyride for the senses
(including the intellect). Where The Prestige ties up in a nice little
bow, Inception leaves you with things to wonder about. Where some
people claimed The Prestige seemed to break its own rules, Inception
does not.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has, in the past, been compared to Stanley Kubrick.
That&#x27;s wrong. Christopher Nolan is Christopher Nolan, and he keeps
consistently proving that fact.<br /><br />He is the most talented director working in the industry today. Period.
