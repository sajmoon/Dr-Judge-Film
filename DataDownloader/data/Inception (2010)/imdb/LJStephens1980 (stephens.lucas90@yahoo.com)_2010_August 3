Having absolutely no idea of what this movie was about, only heightened
the anticipation. Nolan&#x27;s vision here is absolutely stunning. The cast
is perfect, and the story immense, and mysterious.<br /><br />So how does one define inception? Ingenuis Nerve-stretching Concept
Exhilarating Perfect Time Intrieging Overwhelming Nescesity.<br /><br />Which might be a useful description, yet however, if you knew what,
how, and the why of inception, before you sat through it, it weakens
its impact, physically, and emotionally. <br /><br />So go see it, at least twice. <br /><br />Quite simply one screening simply isn&#x27;t enough. Bravo, Christopher
Nolan, and a brilliant cast.
