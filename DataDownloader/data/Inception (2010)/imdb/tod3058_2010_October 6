2010_October 6 
The levels of boredom I reached during this film will take a fair while
for me to forgive Christopher Nolan, the Director, for. A very simple
idea has been taken and, just like my headphones do in my pocket,
twisted and turned to leave me wondering how on earth they managed to
get in this nonsensical situation. It&#x27;s one saving grace, the CGI, has
been used to try to endlessly distract the audience from the utter
tripe being pass off as a story-line. I&#x27;m surprised that the
distributors weren&#x27;t legally obliged to provide the audience with an
eye wash with their ticket, as the intense editing and camera movement
left me, on several occasions, having to check my eyes weren&#x27;t
bleeding.<br /><br />Like The Matrix, it beggars belief that this film is being held up as
some sort of future classic. Either I&#x27;m a genius, hovering in a state
of advanced consciousness, or the people who loved this film are
stoners or morons, unfortunately, for my ego, I suspect the later to be
the reality.<br /><br />Save your money.
