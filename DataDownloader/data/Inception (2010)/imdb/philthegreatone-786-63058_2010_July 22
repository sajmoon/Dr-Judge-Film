I would like to review this film again. I have seen it three times in
the theater already. First start with the visuals, especially in
Ariadne&#x27;s dream when the city of Paris become her playground. Then I
shall talk about the script.. now this is one of the most innovative
scripts I have come across in a long time. I have already put this
movie in my top ten movie list of all time already, and I am not a
person that is easily please like some fan boys of the the dark
knight.No disrespect to the dark knight is is fantastic, it is my top
50 films but not top 15 like it is on IMDb.. come on fan boys you know
it doesn&#x27;t deserve be ahead of taxi driver or apocalypse now, or other
great movies I can&#x27;t think of. Anyway back to Inception the next thing
I want to talk about is the performances like Leonardo DiCaprio in a
fantastic performance one of his best, a emotionally heartfelt
performance from Marion Colltiard, a solid and interesting performance
by Ellen Page.. I love her.. a small but effective performance from
Michael Caine. Next the direction is fantastic from Christopher Nolan
who by the way is the hottest director in Hollywood right now. This
film will last through the ages and be a reference for science fiction
films in the future. It will end up being on top 100 lists of all time.
I am being completely serious.. I think this film is that good, I know
everyone will say it has hints of the matrix and so forth.. but I truly
believe that this film will be nominated for best picture at the Oscars
next year.<br /><br />You can send me messages on this or email me on
