I should warn you that the material you&#x27;re going to see is of
commercial nature, especially the way those shiny computerized tricks
make you wonder about the inherent nature of your being, your life(
probably same as characters) and in this weird piece of crap, dreams
which are the very thought-provoking world of unknown elements. I have
read a lot on dreams and will tell this with certainty that their
efforts to humanize the screenplay are all in vein however taking
advantage of pseudo-isochromatic charts. Are we really expected to take
shots like this seriously? I can no longer ignore my feeling that we
are close to the end of rich cinematic era. As a matter of fact in many
situations, being monotone is better than having bad intonation. The
worst is when someone goes up and down too much on every word or idea,
examples of which can easily be seen in Nolan&#x27;s Inception which is no
longer a commencement, I dare say. I remember a quote cited by a friend
in IMDb which goes like: True art is not domineering, It woos you. 1
for bothering reminding me of the likelihood of words meaning not
exactly what they are supposed to. Those who rate above 1 ain&#x27;t seen
anything yet.
