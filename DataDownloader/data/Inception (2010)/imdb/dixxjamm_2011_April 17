2011_April 17 
I only arrived at the 35 minutes mark on this one and I had to turn it
off. I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven&#x27;t seen in its
entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked
of pretentious and &#x22;interesting&#x22; from the very start. Christopher Nolan
must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series,
that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by
relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other
than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what&#x27;s with all the teenage looking
actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they
are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di
Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero
sequence again, I&#x27;ll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in
Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he&#x27;s just not believable in
those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80&#x27; s
and &#x27;90&#x27;s) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works
sufficiently, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t but the fact that he seems to look
for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier
roles.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll just stop here, I&#x27;ve rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie.
The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only
made it worse, since they were supporting crap.
