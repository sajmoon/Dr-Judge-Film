&#x22;Inception&#x22; is just brilliant. An unusual premise combined with
intelligent story-telling and original writing, resulted in a fantastic
science-fiction thriller with both a dramatic love story and an
action-packed heist. Dreams have never been explored, defined and
created in such an original way before in a film, and in a summer full
of sequels and remakes, it&#x27;s great to finally see a movie with
brand-new and thought provoking material that is without a doubt one of
the best pictures of the year so far.<br /><br />Cobb is an extractor and when somebody is dreaming, he and his team
will be able to access the subject&#x27;s mind, find their way around it and
then retrieve a specific piece of information. Together with his
assistant Arthur and his architect Nash, he is working to retrieve
something from the dream of Saito at the beginning of the film, but
their mission fails when Saito discovers a flaw in the design of the
dream and realizes that he is asleep. Cobb and Arthur are trying to
escape from Japan, but Saito catches them and offers them a job,
requiring them to perform the act of inception, planting an idea in
somebody&#x27;s mind instead of merely retrieving it. Although Arthur is
strictly against it, Cobb reluctantly agrees, mainly because Saito
offers him an opportunity to see his children again, who are cut off
from their father in the United States. Cobb makes his way to Paris to
assemble a new team for this mission, but as it turns out it maybe more
difficult than anticipated to make it out alive of this mission.<br /><br />No synopsis could ever do justice to the complex plot of this film, and
the story depends on so many little factors that you simply have to see
the film to completely understand it. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is complicated, yes,
but if you can keep your brain sharp for the entire 2 1/2 hours, you
are almost guaranteed to leave the movie theatre immensely satisfied
with what you have just witnessed. The film may be complex, but at no
point in this movie I was confused, and that says a lot about the way
this film tries to explain its premise to the audience. You can try to
compare this film with others, such as &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, but ultimately
it&#x27;s in a category all by itself, and could best be defined as a
futuristic crime-thriller. Of course, the entire concept of accessing
and manipulating dreams has to be explained to the baffled audience at
first, before the big coup of planting an idea can take place, a part
mostly filled out by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He has to fill in Ellen
Paige&#x27;s character Ariadne, and his explanations sounded so scientific,
that I had no trouble believing that such a deed could be possible.<br /><br />The film also succeeds, because it cleverly balances an emotional love
story, with numerous scenes of action, but still hardly ever slows
down. Not a single moment seems to be wasted in this film, and I was
captivated by the slowly untangling history between DiCaprio&#x27;s
character and his wife that was very reminiscent of a big puzzle, with
small pieces being added throughout the film, but the complete picture
only offered itself to the viewers at the end. Christopher Nolan truly
shows his ability as a director through the perfectly choreographed
action scenes, and the film already opens in high gears, with a great
shooting scene. Once again, there is a lot happening in the first 15
minutes, and for a while you won&#x27;t realize what is going on, but the
art of this film is that everything seems to make sense sooner or
later. There are several more chase scenes and even more shootings, but
without a doubt the best action scene in this film, quite possibly one
of the best ones ever shot for a film, involves Joseph Gordon-Levitt
fighting off two thugs in the corridor of a hotel room with shifting
and eventually no gravity at all.<br /><br />I still can&#x27;t believe that the young guy from &#x22;Titanic&#x22;, turned out to
be such a great actor, and even makes a convincing hero in an action
film. Leonardo DiCaprio, against all odds, became a real badass in his
film projects, and &#x22;Inception&#x22; is bound to give him his fourth Oscar
nomination, and possibly his first win. He is fantastic, both as the
leader of the team trying to plant the idea, and the tortured husband,
who is haunted by the demons of his wife&#x27;s death. There will definitely
be several discussions about which actors with gather an Oscar
nomination, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is certainly a good candidate, if
only for the beautiful action sequence without gravity. There is not
much revealed about his character, but he has great charisma, and is
really the only one who brings a few humorous moments into this film.
Marion Cotillard, who is in high demand since &#x22;La Vie en Rose&#x22; three
years ago, is at her very best as Cobb&#x27;s deceased wife, who still
haunts him in his dreams. The rest of Cobb&#x27;s team consists of Ellen
Page as Adriane, who does a great job, especially in her interactions
with DiCaprio, Tom Hardy as the cynical Forgerer Eames, and Dileep Rao
as the Chemist Yusuf. Ken Watanabe, who has a great authoritative
presence, plays Saito, who seems to be a villain, but eventually turns
out to be an honorable businessman, and Cillian Murphy plays the man
who is supposed to have the idea planted in his head, who will inherit
his father&#x27;s entire business, despite him being disappointed with his
son.<br /><br />Inception is a movie highlight of the year 2010, and through its fresh
concept will certainly be a candidate for the big trophy at next year&#x27;s
Oscars. Now, I just hope that nobody will attempt to make a sequel of
this film and that Christopher Nolan will put just as much creativity
into his next film, the third &#x22;Batman&#x22; movie.
