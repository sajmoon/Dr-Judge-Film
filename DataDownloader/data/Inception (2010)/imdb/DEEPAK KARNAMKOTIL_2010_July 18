Movie &#x96; Inception<br /><br />To watch and feel the Inception movie &#x85;&#x85;. Here&#x27;s my tip - Watch the
days last show and then go to sleep, u&#x27;ll definitely wake up two or
three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a
spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob
in the movie) . Sorry guys, but that is the hangover u take with u
after watching the movie.<br /><br />OK !&#x85;&#x85;&#x85; Let&#x27;s start the review. <br /><br />Why did I went to watch this movie &#x96; <br /><br />1. It&#x27;s written by C. Nolan and guess what, he also is the director of
this movie. <br /><br />2. The story of dream invasion,it&#x27;s not easy to make a film on this
subject. <br /><br />3. The cast made it more appeal-able. <br /><br />4. New (fresh new) special effect scenes.<br /><br />Highlighting point of the movie &#x96; <br /><br />1.It is a story about dream invasion, where the characters goes into
the dream of Jr. Fischer and wants to implant a new IDEA , which is not
easy ,as the new IDEA will not be accepted by Jr. Fischer (or any
person) because its somebody Else&#x27;s thought or an IDEA. <br /><br />2. So, to make it possible, they have a plan. And it is the execution
of this plan which is shown in the movie. <br /><br />3. To be very honest, it&#x27;s not a fairy tale story or a fantasy kind of
movie/story. <br /><br />4. The technical aspects of this movie are immaculate, because every
action had its true reaction. The use of Science (Physics) used in this
movie is awesome.<br /><br />5. The story is very real in its hypothesis, For e.g. &#x96; a) If the Van
is falling from a bridge into the water in 1 min (in the 1st dream),
then it will wake up the guys in 10 mins in the 2nd layer of their
dream and 30 mins for the guys in the 3nd layer of the dream &#x85; and many
more examples which is kept very realistic. <br /><br />About the director &#x96;<br /><br />Standing ovation for Mr. Christopher Nolan. <br /><br />1. For writing this movie/story. <br /><br />2. To make or direct a movie exactly as it is written.<br /><br />3.Even though the story is very complicated, Nolan helped us to
understand this movie. You can feel his efforts, and he did everything
to make this movie understandable. In fact Inception is much easy to
understand than Memento.<br /><br />4. He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspense. There
isn&#x27;t any dull moment in the movie. 5. Special effects were new&#x85;&#x85;. Look
out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt fight.<br /><br />Performances &#x96; <br /><br />1. Leonardo is the star of this movie<br /><br />2. Tom Hardy(Handsome Bob ) is the second in the performance<br /><br />3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the stylish and sexy. <br /><br />Summary &#x96; I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if
the film is good. So, sorry &#x85;No clues <br /><br />Just watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u&#x27;ll definitely
wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u
can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as
used by Mr.Cob in the movie)
