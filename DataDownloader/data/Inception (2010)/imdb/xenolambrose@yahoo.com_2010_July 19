For parents who are looking for a thought provoking movie where you&#x27;re
getting you money&#x27;s worth, DON&#x27;T bring pre-teens.<br /><br />The movie is very well acted by all, especially notable was Joseph
Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s performance who, at one of the most critical points in
the movie, is able to think clearly, improvise, and is the only one
aware (as far as I could make out of it) that his actions/inactions
will save the day for the mission and his comrades.<br /><br />With that caveat, let me say that this is a movie that I found
thoroughly captivating, and at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, could have had
some careful editing to shorten the length of a few scenes but very
few.<br /><br />I could have missed it, but didn&#x27;t notice any Eff-bombs, and the
violence is reserved for the dream sequences (which make up probably
95% of the flick) and like most dreams there are elements (even
violent) that don&#x27;t seem to make any sense even for pacifists or ones
who consider themselves very moral.<br /><br />On the morality point, there are many lessons here for all, and it is
clearly evident to those in the film, from trust to regret to
redemption.<br /><br />Unless your child is very intelligent, leave them at home and promise
to take them to &#x22;Despicable Me&#x22; or something else they&#x27;ll understand.<br /><br />If you choose to forgo the above, do yourself and the audience in the
theater a favor--bring duct tape, and be prepared to use it.<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t, after the first dozen &#x22;What&#x27;s happening,&#x22; &#x22;Is it real,&#x22;
&#x22;I don&#x27;t understand,&#x22; etc, your theater neighbors will no doubt be more
than willing to escort the kids, and you, to the nearest exit.<br /><br />This is a complex, thinking person&#x27;s movie. It&#x27;s not a DVD that you can
pause and take however long (if even possible) to try to help your kids
to understand.<br /><br />That doesn&#x27;t mean that the totality of the movie is impossible to
understand for an adult, and there is just enough, left to your own
imagination, that you can interpret parts, the ending, or the entire
movie in alternate ways.<br /><br />This is not to infer that you&#x27;ll be throwing your money away going to
see the movie--far from it, it&#x27;s the type of thought provoking movie
that will have you re-running in your own mind, and/or discussing it
with others for some time.<br /><br />But save yourself some money if you have the kind of wonderful, loving,
normal pre-teens that most of us do--and this isn&#x27;t a challenge for
those who are convinced that their kids are the exceptional few who
will understand what&#x27;s going on without having to play 20,000 questions
during the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />You&#x27;ve been warned, and your fellow theater-goers WILL be bringing
their own duct tape for the ?-askers.
