After a very strong &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; it seem to be impossible for
Nolan to create a more intriguing story and plot. As this modern
director knows what he&#x27;s holding in his hands, he slides you into an
imaginary world where you believe it can be true. Everything is being
portrait in details and very real. This combined with a imaginary
fantasy idea that we can go into other people&#x27;s dreams, sounds an easy
story line, but it&#x27;s the whole road that makes this movie so different
and perfect.<br /><br />Starting with the script. The idea is already something where you can
talk about a lot... what is happening in your dreams and how do you
control it? Than Nolan manages to create this whole emotional story,
which is the ground base of the movie... Can you control your dreams?
Adventually he gives the main characters a choice, depending on the
viewers that they will follow this character into the plot... do you
want to control your dreams?<br /><br />You also have the genuine and perfect acting performances. DiCaprio
gets to another level with this performance, Cotillard gives an extra
impulse to the story and manages to surprise us again, Page doses her
emotions more &#x26; more and is credible in her role, Gordon-Levitt
performs one of the most impossible scenes in movie history and gets
away with it,... All these acting performances (how small or how big
they even are), are very matched to each other.<br /><br />The music is bombastic and subtle at the right moment... Hans Zimmer
will be a very strong contender for an Oscar. It lifts some scenes even
more to a floating level.<br /><br />The FX are near to perfect, scene with DiCaprio/Page at a Paris Caf&#xE9; is
something you have to watch over and over again. It pops The Matrix
into another dimension.<br /><br />But most of all, it&#x27;s all about the producing and directing this movie,
and that&#x27;s where Nolan comes in (again). This man not only deserves an
Oscar nomination (after already some near to perfect movies like &#x27;The
Dark Knight&#x27;, &#x27;Memento&#x27; &#x26; &#x27;Batman Begins&#x27;), he is a genuine artist with
lots of stories to tell and brings us entertainment from another,
exciting level. A level we needed after all those years with all those
superhero movies, sequels &#x26; remakes. Thank you Nolan, crew &#x26; cast...
and don&#x27;t you dare NOT to see this movie... It will be one of your
favourites for sure!
