There is no way &#x22;Inception&#x22; will be a bad movie because it was directed
by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe this movie and
those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting, overwhelming,
entertaining, and awesome. &#x22;Inception&#x22; might be the only movie this
summer that has an original concept.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals
were overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were
realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and mind-bending.The
performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor. Tom
Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie. Cillian
Murphy is disappointing though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s performance is
flawless.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is mind-bending and non-stop entertaining. Once again
Christopher Nolan made another successful blockbuster. &#x22;Inception&#x22;
might be the best movie of the year.
