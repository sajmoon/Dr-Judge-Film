Ever since the inception of INCEPTION i have been a die hard fan and
was at my at most impatience to see the movie immediately.After
watching the movie it left me amazed,mind-numbed,flabbergasted but i
have to admit very regrettably it wasn&#x27;t perfect.The only thing
INCEPTION lacked was emotion.If only Nolan had played with the right
mix emotions this would have been a MASTERPIECE.I felt the movie needed
a little more nail-biting and riveting scenes.I don&#x27;t see any possible
Oscar nominations for the actors because they had nothing to work
on.Probable nominations for this movie would be in the categories of
Best movie,Direction and screenplay.I can conclude by saying Nolan
keeps improving and improvising with every movie he makes and his sheer
intelligence just amazes me!!!Definitely one of the best movies of the
decade!!!
