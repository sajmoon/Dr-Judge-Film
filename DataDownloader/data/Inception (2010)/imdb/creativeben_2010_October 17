This seriously is one of those films where you are TRULY entertained!
You can&#x27;t put it in a limited amount of words, its just amazing!!! i
loved how the idea was original and so cleverly portrayed and played
out in this amazing film. The acting was brilliant: Leonardo was great
in here and really got into character, Ellen was brilliant and stood
out in this film, Cillian Murphy, Joseph etc. they were all good in
this film! This film played with your mind but not in a way you are
lost in the plot but in a way which makes you think from all angles of
the plot. Its easy to catch the gist of it and then you just let the
effects fill up the little bits you are confused about. It was made
with sophistication which is what i like about Christopher Nolan. I
loved how you felt involved in the film and with the characters even
though you physically weren&#x27;t in the film. There were scenes which made
your jaw drop, they were that epic! This is beyond brilliant, a
definite must see!!! BUT....beware the few uses of blasphemy which was
the only disappointment in the film. Christopher Nolan uses his very
creative and intelligent filmmaking mind as he did with &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;.
I am proud to be British by looking at Christopher Nolans films, he has
done an amazing job on &#x22;Inception&#x22;.
