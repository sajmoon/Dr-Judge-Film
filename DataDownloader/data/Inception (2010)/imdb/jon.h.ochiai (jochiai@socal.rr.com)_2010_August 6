In &#x22;Inception&#x22; Ellen Page&#x27;s dream architect Ariadne asks Leonardo
DiCaprio&#x27;s haunted Cobb, &#x22;Why is it so important to dream?&#x22; Hamlet
contemplated death saying: &#x22;To sleep: perchance to dream.&#x22; All is not
as it appears. Director and Writer Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22; is
the most original movie of the last 5 years. Nolan takes &#x22;Inception&#x22;
quantum levels beyond his &#x22;Memento&#x22;. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is simply awesome. My
bud Darin cautioned that one has to focus intently during the first 20
minutes of &#x22;Inception&#x22;, and then it really gets confusing. Master
storyteller Nolan takes us on a wild ride and circles back and
completes all of the story arcs and threads. Leonardo DiCarprio is
powerful. He plays Dom Cobb, a corporate espionage specialist whose
explicit gift is extracting people&#x27;s dreams. He is hired by ruthless
CEO Saito (charismatic Ken Watanabe) to liquidate a rival corporation.<br /><br />Cobb must do the impossible and create a dream in Fischer (Cillian
Murphy), the surviving son of Saito&#x27;s corporate rival. This is
inception, which Cobb reminds Saito has never been done before. And
Cobb is lying. He is a flawed tragic hero, who literally imprisons a
dark secret. He is a fugitive living abroad, offering his specific
service. Inception may be his last chance at redemption for his very
soul and reuniting with his young son and daughter.<br /><br />Cobb assembles his team. He returns to visit his mentor Miles (solid
and great Michael Caine) at a university in Paris. Cobb enrolls Miles&#x27;s
best student Ariadne (spirited and smart Ellen Page) as his dream
architect. Apparently, you can get a PhD in dream architecture in
Paris&#x97;go figure. In a visually stunning display of manipulated dreams
Paris literally bends sideways. Ariadne has an innate gift and is
totally hooked. Perceptive Ariadne discerns that Cobb is a deadly
liability to the mission&#x97;he is haunted by dreams of his wife Mal
(captivatingly suffering Marion Cotillard). Cobb tells Ariadne to
create dreams anew, never from memories. Apparently, Cobb is violating
his own rule.<br /><br />In Chris Nolan&#x27;s construct, dreams have 3 defined levels. The fourth
level is the subconscious, an eternity of desire and fear. Also because
the mind accelerates in deeper levels of dreams, we experience a dream
time dilation&#x97;an homage to Einstein? In this dream math: something like
20 seconds is 20 minutes in level 1, 2 hours in level 2, 2 weeks in
level 3, and on the order of years in level 4. Nolan meticulously
orchestrates all elements as a van plunges into a river. There is the
distinct danger that one may be lost for a lifetime in the
subconscious&#x97;imprisoned and unable to escape for eternity. So the 2.5
hours of &#x22;Inception&#x22; would be&#x97;I kid. Ironically, Cobb and all involved
are willing to risk this for merely money and corporate gain.<br /><br />What occurs as peculiar in Act 2 in level 3 of the dream is the James
Bond-like commando raid on the snow covered fortress. Outwardly, this
seems very cheesy. Then the story focuses on Fischer&#x27;s memories of his
disapproving father. Further beneath Cobb must reconcile the ghosts of
his wife or forever be lost. Cillian Murphy is surprising in his quiet
humanity and power. DiCaprio is powerful and commanding throughout.
Nolan generates the space for creation. DiCaprio effortlessly is just
being, and is so compelling. For me, &#x22;Inception&#x22; resonates in these 2
poignant story arcs. Particularly, with Murphy&#x27;s Fischer there is
amazing catharsis, even in retrospect it may have been manufactured.
Nolan is brilliant. I think in &#x22;Inception&#x22; memories are just
memories&#x97;it is the stories we create about them that either empower us
or imprison us. In the end Nolan comes full circle and completes the
journey, then in the last frame he makes us wonder. Chris Nolan is the
master storyteller&#x97;enthralling us and always making us consider the
possibilities.
