There was a Film Named &#x22;M&#x22; (1931)(german) ,it was not just an ordinary
film ,it made such an impact on people Mind ,tat they never forgot the
movie in their entire life time .... those were the times ,when there
was no IMDb or box-office or 5 min movie updates .... yet still the
reviews for the movie said .. &#x22; It will take at least 10 years for good
films like this 2 come &#x22; .... to everyone&#x27;s surprise it took 60 years
for such an masterpiece in Film making , such story , such screenplay
.. what am trying 2 say is &#x22; M &#x22; was in 1931 ... In 2010 It&#x27;s
&#x22;Inception&#x22; .. This Epic Film will test your intelligence , your way of
imagining things .. &#x22; .every minute detail in this film is so awesome ,
that you will keep on thinking about this one at-least for two days ,
every Christopher Nolan has an impact one you , trust me this one will
change everything .Don&#x27;t watch this movie in Ur lap-top or i-pad or
anything , its worth every penny you spend on this one , A complete
Film ... i don&#x27;t wanna a write a 2 page review on this one &#x22; Go Live
