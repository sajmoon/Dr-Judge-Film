It takes a special person to make Inception the great movie that it is.
Indeed, Christopher Nolan accomplishes the task with prodigious
aesthetic skill, from the direction to the script. Even more impressive
is the way the cast delivered their performance. John Papsidera&#x27;s
casting choices simply cannot get better, particularly in the manner of
Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. DiCaprio reprises his
existing roles as the anti-hero who saves the day, while Joseph
Gordon-Levitt acts as his learned, trustworthy right-hand man. Michael
Caine was also a good choice, once again acting as the influential,
instrumental bystander to the events that take place in the movie.
Actors who normally wouldn&#x27;t appear in such a genre as Inception also
deliver exceptional performances, such as Ellen Page as Cobb&#x27;s
impressionable student. While Inception itself is impressive, the
casting choice only enhances the overall story and execution,
transforming it into a classic of our times.
