Inception is the kind of film that slowly and carefully folds your
brain back in on itself,while at the same time delivering incredible
action sequences and great acting.Leonardo De Caprio stars in what
could be the greatest film of the past decade.<br /><br />STORY:The story revolves around the world of dreams,which allows some
really crazy moments that would deify all the laws of physics,like zero
gravity,cities being turned upside down(literally) and skyscrapers
being shaped and destroyed in the distance while sandcastles are being
shaped and destroyed in the same shot.Dom Cobb is an extractor.His job
is to go into peoples dreams,steal their secrets,then sell them to a
rival businessman.But then he has to do THE hardest
job.Inception.Planting an idea rather than stealing one.And so ensues a
lenghtly adventure with a wide range of memorable characters in unique
locations.The story requires attention to every detail,and can be
extremely confusing to kids and even adults,but is extremely enjoyable
when you get it,but you often need two attempts to fully understand the
plot.The Story gets 10 out of 10.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS:Brilliant and physcadelic effects add to the already
stylish experience.From a whole street imploding in slow motion,to a
military base collapsing on the side of a snowy mountainside,a dream
city being completely ripped apart and a hotel being spun on it&#x27;s
axis.Action sequences are choreographed excellently and have lots of
punch to them.10 out of 10.<br /><br />SOUND:Hanz Zimmer&#x27;s booming soundtrack will have your ears ringing for
hours while it belts out exciting instrumentals.The actors give their
performances very realistically with well written dialog and sound
effects are incredible in the dream sequences.10 out of 10.<br /><br />Inception is an incredible story driven mind boggling film that is a
must see for mature sci-fi and action fans.10 out of 10.<br /><br />----------------------------------
