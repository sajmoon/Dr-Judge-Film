story is outstanding, execution is brilliant, cast is great (i didn&#x27;t
like Ellen page at all but she started to grow on me after this movie),
music is awesome. don&#x27;t listen to anyone, watch! i don&#x27;t care if some
comics lover sais &#x22;the story is stolen yada yada&#x22;. Great movie to have
in your collection, i am sure you will come back to watching it once in
a while. Great entertainment.<br /><br />story is outstanding, execution is brilliant, cast is great (i didn&#x27;t
