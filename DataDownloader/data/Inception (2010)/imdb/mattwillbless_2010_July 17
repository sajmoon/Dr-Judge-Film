No words can describe the experience i had watching Nolan&#x27;s Inception.
It kept me at the edge of the seat until the very end. No doubt, this
is the most thrilling ride i&#x27;ve ever had. I loved the way Nolan builds
suspense at the end. When i was at the peak of uncertainty suddenly the
credits appeared and i couldn&#x27;t help but scream &#x27;WOW!&#x27; which repeated
from many other parts of the theater followed by an applause. You will
definitely be confused when you leave the theater. You will be spending
a lot of time replaying every scene in your mind, going through every
dialogs. The more time you spend things become clearer and clearer. I
really recommend this movie to anyone who&#x27;s enjoys an element of
uncertainty at the end of a movie!
