This is one of the few projects which I have been following since the
beginning. Being a Nolan fan, I obviously had very high expectations.
Keeping myself away from reviews, I bought the midnight show&#x27;s ticket
of the very first night. I have just experienced a marvel which we are
not going to experience for a long long time now. There was a high
probability that I would not have been satisfied, having such high
expectations. But Nolan goes beyond that. Something our minds can&#x27;t
even expect. Till the last minute I understood each and every detail.
Feeling good that I understood such a great movie in one screening. But
wait, right in the end, the very last minute, he screws your brains in
so many ways you can&#x27;t even imagine. As I submerged into deep thoughts,
the rising applause brought me back. I have no doubt that this the best
movie. I know people will obviously challenge that. But I also know
that these will be the people who can not absorb the fact that they
liked a &#x27;Summer Blockbuster&#x27; this much. People who just want to be
different by having a different opinion. People who can not accept the
fact that there can still be ideas better than the all time favorite
plots like Star Wars, Matrix, etc. That there can still be a movie
which can beat our all time favorite classics. That there can still be
a director who can achieve such perfection and top all our and his
favorite director&#x27;s works. This is sheer brilliance.
