I&#x27;ve seen many of director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s films by now. Here are
my thoughts on each of them:<br /><br />Following (1998)<br /><br />The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing,
but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda
cheated.<br /><br />Memento (2000)<br /><br />The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing,
but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda
cheated.<br /><br />Insomnia (2002)<br /><br />The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing,
but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda
cheated.<br /><br />Batman Begins (2005)<br /><br />After feeling kinda cheated by previous Nolan efforts, I did not bother
with this one. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)<br /><br />The Prestige (2006)<br /><br />The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing,
but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda
cheated.<br /><br />The Dark Knight (2008)<br /><br />Watched this one because of all the high ratings on the internet sites.
The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing,
but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda
cheated. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)<br /><br />Inception (2010)<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s best effort yet, and while the craft is really superb and the
thematic elements are certainly intriguing, on the whole it comes off
as *extremely*, pointlessly gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.<br /><br />Overall assessment:<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan with more elaborate gimmicks. Emperor Nolan isn&#x27;t
wearing any clothes, you philistines!
