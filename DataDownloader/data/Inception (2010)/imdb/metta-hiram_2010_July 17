This movie just went off the charts. Photography, Music, Plot, Visual
Effects, Acting, the Story in General... you name it, they all receive
a 10+ from me.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t say this movie is perfect because it WAS created by human
beings but I can say that it is pretty close.<br /><br />If you truly wish to be amazed by new concepts, a good story, and
absolutely phenomenal special effects... than I guess this is the movie
you have been looking for.<br /><br />This movie is unique in every way. After just a few minutes in you will
feel the desire to actually want to watch the entire movie just because
of the interest you have on the subject/story...kinda like what old
movies were back in the day. I cannot compare to any other movie since
it is very unique so if I could I can say it&#x27;s up there with other
unique movies like Perfume, Avatar, 300 or Kill Bill (even though you
still can&#x27;t really compare).<br /><br />You will be glad to see this movie. Plus as a bonus you get your moneys
worth (unlike many others).<br /><br />Watch it in theaters, not from the net, not from DVD...believe me it&#x27;s
worth every penny.
