After creating memorable movies like Memento, Prestige, Batman Begins
and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan comes with a rare gem &#x96;
Inception. The protagonists of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan
generally have a dark side, and he follows the same ritual in
Inception. Christopher Nolan has ensemble a great cast for the movie,
which adds grandeur effect.<br /><br />Inception is about dreams and most of the movie and action sequences
take place in the dream. Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) makes a team for a
mission, which will make them rich and clear of all the charges of the
protagonist. Dicaprio is haunted by his wife in his dreams during
mission. The work they do is to steal ideas from the minds of business
tycoons but the last mission requires them to plant a new idea &#x96;
Inception. The sequences of dream within a dream will surely blow your
mind. The movie demands attention of the viewers, if you miss some
efficient parts of the movie, you will stay confused. Inception needs
multiple viewings for sure. The gravity action sequence of Arther
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is exhilarating and half the audience clapped as
this gripping scene ended.<br /><br />The editing of the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. The word
which defines the cinematography of the movie by Wally Pfister is
remarkable. By the end of the movie you will realize that Christopher
Nolan has successfully planted a resilient parasite, an idea and a
dream in your mind. The script is so cleverly written and executed that
the viewers can&#x27;t help but indulge themselves in the movie. It is one
of the most complicated scripts to write and visualize. A script like
this can easily be followed by errors but everything in Inception is
precise. The movie deserves four Oscars for sure Best Director, Best
Writing Original Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Cinematography.
