Once upon a time in the mind of a master, this film was only a dream. A
dream waiting to be brought onto paper. Then came the hard part;
bringing that dream alive on screen. The film itself was a dream to
Nolan and later became a dream to us. A shared dream that cinema can
still offer more than a couple of explosions and a rehashed storyline.
A dream that we can still sit in a movie theater and have absolutely no
idea what will happen next. A dream that we can be amazed and have a
film penetrate so deeply into our own minds. A radical notion of what
film can achieve at its full potential. We can still be thinking about
it days after we leave the theater and then come back for more. That we
can still be challenged as an audience to think, while this story is
being told to us. This is a dream so big that only a few film makers
can still manage to properly execute. May I say; this is a dream come
true.<br /><br />After the huge success of &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, Christopher Nolan received
a blank check to do whatever he wanted with. Could he have made a
better choice? I don&#x27;t think so. He decided to revive an old idea. This
idea is that a blockbuster can be more than dumb fun. That has been
achieved here. Nolan takes us into our own minds and explores the
dynamics of a dream. A very relatable topic because we have all
experienced the sensation. From here we have a story that is so
unpredictable and takes us all over the place. Not because of any cheap
twists of turns but because it is so intelligently woven. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s
score is brilliantly crafted and fits perfectly to every scene. The
music will also create any mood it needs to. The visual effects, set
pieces, and locations are just all out beautiful. With some of the best
actions scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen. The editing and fast pace story telling
adds a sense of rush to the film which is essential to the plot. The
direction is fantastic in action scenes and even small scenes of
dialogue, which is also great.<br /><br />Not to be forgotten is the wrenching emotional backstory of Cobb and
Mal. With turns that I did not see coming because they&#x27;re so well
hidden and eventually so well told. Combined with the phenomenal
performances of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard we have
something that drives a different aspect of the film. Joseph Gordon
Levitt shines and now in what is destined to become a classic,
innovative, action film scene. Ellen Page proves to be versatile
actress and captures a great sense innocence in her character. At the
same time she displays the emotions of the audience. The amazement and
confusion felt towards the idea of invading others minds and dreams.
Wanting to learn more about it but unaware of the dangers. Cillian
Murphy had a surprisingly great performance as a neglected son and heir
to his father&#x27;s company. Ken Wantanabe was extremely good as usual. Tom
Hardy and Dileep Rao were both very strong members of the supporting
cast. Tom Berenger was also good where he was needed.<br /><br />An amazing cast, mind blowing visuals, intelligently written story,
beautiful direction, and non-stop thrills make for another Chis Nolan
masterpiece. He managed to do something thought impossible, bring
originality back to the mainstream. From head to toe this movie spells
perfection though it comes through a cost. The cost being that the
average movie goer, dumbed down by the affects (and effects) of Michael
Bay and company, will not understand this movie. It&#x27;s nothing
incomprehensible it just requires your full attention and many aren&#x27;t
use to movies making them think. Anyone with half and will to use it
shall understand it in full. It may take a second viewing but most
likely you will want to revisit the film. This is among the best movies
I&#x27;ve ever seen. It is the full and complete film experience, the way it
was meant to be. Inception is set to be a classic for science fiction,
heist movies, actions, and mind-benders. This is a reminder to me why I
love cinema.<br /><br />Final Rating: 10/10
