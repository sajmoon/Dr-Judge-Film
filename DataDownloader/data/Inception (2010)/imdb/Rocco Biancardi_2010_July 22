It is difficult to put into words how amazing Inception is! It is a
true masterpiece from Nolan, filled with enough stunning set-pieces and
action to keep action junkies amused and enough emotional drama and
intelligence for others. The acting is superb throughout, DiCaprio and
Cotillard are an incredible central duo, but every other character,
both large and small is brilliant. There are stunning sequences which
leave you breathless, including a couple of incredible fights in
zero-gravity. The tension of the film is almost unbearable at points
but it adds to it, rather than detracting anything. The film is near
faultless! Incredible, definitely one of the best cinema experiences
I&#x27;ve ever had. If you haven&#x27;t seen it, see it. If you have, see it
again! Near perfect.
