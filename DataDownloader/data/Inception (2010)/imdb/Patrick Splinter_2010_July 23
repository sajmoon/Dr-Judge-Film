I went to Inception based on word of mouth that it was a real head
scratcher. One person quoted &#x22;If I told you the last 5 minutes of the
movie it wouldn&#x27;t be a spoiler&#x22; another &#x22;when the lights come up you&#x27;ll
be staring at the screen going &#x27;what just happened&#x27;&#x22;. So I went into
this movie ready to watch everything. I wanted to be outguessed. I
didn&#x27;t want to know where it was going. I wanted a ride.<br /><br />It turned out I liked this movie not for the reasons I went to it. I
like many in the theater could guess the ending (at the very end there
was laughter at my showing). This movie is great for the idea, the
visuals (this movie could not have been made 15 years ago) and the
acting.<br /><br />First the idea: Entering people&#x27;s dreams. What is a dream and what is
reality? Going down layers and layers. the best part of the movie is
trying to keep straight what is happening and when. The last 45 minutes
of the movie I had to almost draw a diagram in my head to keep it
straight. This movie it not for your Transformers or Twilight crowd.
this is a thinkers movie.<br /><br />The Visuals: The reality bending world of dreams was done so well that
I didn&#x27;t roll my eyes at the CGI. The CGI aided the story and didn&#x27;t
show off at all. Some time I knew in my head some stuff was CGI, but it
was so well done that I thought they might not have used CGI for those
parts. I knew they did, but you could not tell. Simply put you could go
to this movie and not understand at all what happened and enjoy it for
the mid bending visuals before your eyes.<br /><br />The acting: Leonardo Dicaprio is getting better and better every movie
he makes. Even though he is one of the most well known actors in the
world I was thinking of him as &#x22;Cobb&#x22; they whole time. Tom cruise
should just have all his characters called Tom. The supporting cast was
top notch. All very well done.<br /><br />The downside: I hope the ending was not supposed to be a surprise
because the audience I was with all laughed at the very end. We all
knew what the end was...but I guess that&#x27;s what one reviewer meant by
&#x22;I can tell you the last 5 minutes and it won&#x27;t be a spoiler&#x22;. It
wasn&#x27;t.<br /><br />I gave this a 9 out of 10. Great movie. It&#x27;s be a load of bull if it&#x27;s
not Best Picture. The only hit was I think the ending was supposed to
be a surprise. It didn&#x27;t matter that it wasn&#x27;t.
