2010_July 21 
I arrived in the theater, bought my ticket and waited impatiently for
about over 9000 commercials about crap I do not care about. I&#x27;m always
a bit early at the theaters, as I have a bigger chance at better seats
then. Then my neighbor sat next to me, with an entire shop worth of
chips, cookies and coke. Then the movie started. My neighbor devoured
her food and chips as if it were her last while I tried to enjoy this
masterpiece. I closed all possible connections to the real world as I
watched Christopher Nolan&#x27;s latest work: &#x27;Inception&#x27;, a movie where I
only started blinking when the end credits were rolling.<br /><br />Nolan and his younger brother have been... let&#x27;s say notorious for
making some of the best movies the world has ever seen, including
&#x27;Insomnia&#x27;, &#x27;The Prestige&#x27; (I have reviewed this movie) and &#x27;The Dark
Knight&#x27;. All of these are must-see films. Remember people, the reviews
I write ARE BASED UPON MY OPINION. If you do not like it, I have no
problem with that, as you are entitled to YOUR OPINIONS. If I say that
Kill Bill is bad, you shouldn&#x27;t be insulted by this, as it is MY
opinion. I&#x27;m not saying your opinion is wrong. Clear on that? Let&#x27;s
move on.<br /><br />Nolan has a very unorthodox way of making movies. They always have a
dark, serious tone and he always puts 101% of himself to make it just
like that. This movie is no exception. This is more realistic than &#x27;The
Dark Knight&#x27; (is that even possible?) and more visceral than &#x27;The
Prestige&#x27;. Personally (remember this word people, before you start
shitting on my review), I think this might be the most realistic movie
ever made. Or, at least, one of the most realistic ones.<br /><br />I will try to make the summary as closed and tied up as possible
because you really need to see the movie for yourself. You&#x27;ll be more
surprised that way, as you don&#x27;t need me to tell all the little details
because the movie just surprised and keeps you immersed at every single
turn.<br /><br />In the near-distant future, mankind has developed a very secret and
dangerous technology that enables people to &#x27;live&#x27; a dream and get in
in other people&#x27;s dreams, to steal their secrets or to plan something
together in that dream. Cobb (played by DiCaprio) is one of those
thieves of secrets. Unfortunately, he is being falsely accused by the
government and must now assemble a team to -in the end of it all- solve
his problem. And that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll tell you.<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; immediately commences with a great start, some gunfire,
explosions, mystery. Nothing in the movie seems to make sense in the
beginning, like &#x27;Donnie Darko&#x27;. But -in my opinion- where &#x27;Donnie
Darko&#x27; failed to be interesting in the beginning, (needing 45 minutes
before interest arose) &#x27;Inception&#x27; does something very rarely (at least
for me) by hooking you in at the very start. As soon as I was watching,
I couldn&#x27;t let go. You&#x27;re immediately plunged into a world of mystery
and doubt, where people start to question what is real or not.<br /><br />&#x22;Why and how does that work?&#x22; you might ask. &#x22;Well...&#x22; I would say.
&#x22;This is simply proper filmmaking. This is Christopher Nolan at his
best.&#x22; Like &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27;, Nolan brings Hans Zimmer along for the
ride, creating the best music for a movie ever. Look, as unbelievable
as this might sound, let me explain. You have movies, ...like
&#x27;Gladiator&#x27;, &#x27;The Bourne Identity&#x27;, &#x27;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x27;, &#x27;The Lord of
the Rings-series&#x27;, I could just go on and on and on. All of these
movies are great and have some of the best soundtracks out there. But
&#x27;Inception&#x27;&#x27;s soundtrack is just... exceptional. The music was just the
best thing in the movie. I know that, for a ten out of ten, everything
should be equally as good, but this is my review, remember? It is my
opinion. This is the finest proof that Hans Zimmer literally is the
Mozart of the 21st Century and I have never heard a grander, more
hulking soundtrack before.<br /><br />People on the internet sometimes ask: &#x22;Is it like &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; or just
something entirely different?&#x22; Well, I think it&#x27;s definitely inspired
by &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;, but Nolan takes the concept of &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; and brings
it to a whole &#x27;nother level. &#x27;Inception&#x27; is smarter than &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;,
less confusing and more satisfying. While you needed some time (I know
I did) to understand &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;, &#x27;Inception&#x27; takes a bit more time
for you to fully take in the concept of it.<br /><br />I am seventeen years old and have probably seen about (literally) a
thousand movies in my life. During that time I have always kept my
score chart with me to keep track of the best movies. &#x27;Inception&#x27;, is
only the third movie I give a ten. It&#x27;s... perfect. While I couldn&#x27;t
stand Ellen Page&#x27;s character in the movie, this has nothing to do
whether she can act or not. Everyone, and I mean everyone in this movie
delivers here, with DiCaprio, Watanabe and Cilian Murphy at the top
here.<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is, in my opinion, not overrated. Christopher Nolan is not
an overrated director. I&#x27;m not a guy following the crowd like a sheep,
but this is an exception. &#x27;Inception&#x27; is worth a solid ten for pure,
unrelenting effort. It delivers and delivers and delivers. It is unique
and engaging on so many ways and on so many levels. &#x27;Inception&#x27; is
just, so beautiful, so amazing, so huge, so immersive. I could&#x27;ve
talked about the amazing special effects and surprises and some of the
scenes but really, after all this talking about it, you wouldn&#x27;t want
me to spoil even the smallest detail of it, now would you?
