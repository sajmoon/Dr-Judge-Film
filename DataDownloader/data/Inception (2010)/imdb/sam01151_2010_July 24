Mind blowing idea seeded within Christopher Nolan created the best
movie of all-time.<br /><br />Absolutely cinematic music by Hans Zimmer, mind twisting plot, stunning
effects and filming.<br /><br />I thank everyone(including the staffs) who contributed to making this
movie for us to enjoy, and I hope that this isn&#x27;t not the end of this
whole movement of seeking creative movie ideas.<br /><br />I cannot explain it all, but just to tell you to watch it your-self.<br /><br />That&#x27;s the best thing anyone could do after they watch this movie.<br /><br />WATCH IT!!!!!
