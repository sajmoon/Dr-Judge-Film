Inception is a mind-bending, intelligent, action packed movie. In
general, those are three things you don&#x27;t expect to see together.
Inception&#x27;s story revolves around Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) and his work as
an extraction agent. I&#x27;m not going to give much away, but Cobb has to
do one last job in order to get what he wants, and for that he needs to
get a team together. Eventually the team embarks on their job, and
secrets revolving around Cobb start to unfold and affect the mission.<br /><br />Now this movie was AWESOME. It manages to fill itself with enough
intelligent conversation and ideas to keep the intellectual crowd
thinking, while making it simple enough for simpler movie audiences to
understand. The action scenes are all great, with only a few
distracting moments. There is a lot of action in this movie, but it all
has its place, and it takes breaks at the right moments so that you can
calm down and think a little bit.<br /><br />Now as I said there are a LOT of action sequences. While they belong
and they don&#x27;t necessarily feel out of place, they all seem to take
away from the screen time of the actors. Every actor is really good and
besides Leo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, and Marion Cotillard (in a
surprisingly great performance) no one gets much screen time to beg for
that Supporting Actor Oscar.<br /><br />But in all reality, this was a great, great, great, movie. It is
completely worth seeing, theater or home, so long as you see this movie
before the end of the year, it will have been worth it. This is easily
the best summer movie so far.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.
