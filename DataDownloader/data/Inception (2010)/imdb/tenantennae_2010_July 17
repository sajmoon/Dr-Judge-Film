...because this movie is chock full of that. It would have been nice to
just watch without having the characters explain the dynamics of every
situation to each other. All that talk makes the movie needlessly long
and adds nothing to the story. <br /><br />I&#x27;m sure the audience goes into a summer action movie about dream
invasion with their suspension of disbelief sufficiently high not to
need an rational explanation of every fantastic thing that happens. <br /><br />After hearing several critics say this was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
masterpiece, I was disappointed to find that it falls short of all his
prior films, particularly in terms of real depth. With the exception of
DiCaprio, the characters are one dimensional and the object of their
mission is uninspired and forgettable. <br /><br />Not a terrible movie, or a bad one. Not even a mediocre one. Just don&#x27;t
believe the hype. &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; it is not.
