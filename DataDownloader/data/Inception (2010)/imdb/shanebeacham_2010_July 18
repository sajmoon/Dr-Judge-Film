Inception has been hyped up for a long while. And all I can say is that
it was definitely worth the wait. I&#x27;m not gonna explain the plot
because the less you know the better it is (trust me), but it&#x27;s story
is incredible.<br /><br />Now there some reviews out that have stated that we don&#x27;t focus more on
the supporting characters and that the film doesn&#x27;t have a lot of
emotion. Don&#x27;t believe it. These characters are given as much
development as they needed and there&#x27;s a subplot in the movie that is
heavy on the emotion.<br /><br />And the performances are staggering. Leonardo DiCaprio needs to at
least get an Oscar nomination for this film (and a win for Shutter
Island) and he drives the film in the best way possible. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt also does an incredible job in the role as well. Some
other supporting roles such as Ken Wantabe, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy,
and Marion Cotillard are also really great in the movie, but the
supporting role that I really liked was Tom Hardy as Eames. He felt
like the James Bond of the film, and I think he should get more
recognition.<br /><br />The film has been compared to films like The Matrix, but I only see one
connection between this and the Matrix: using an item to get to the
dream world. But unlike Matrix, this is about being in a dream not in a
parallel world. This is the most original idea in a long while, and the
way it&#x27;s executed with its visuals and its story telling is
awe-inspiring. The movie makes The Matrix look like The Phantom Menace,
and I love The Matrix. Well the first one anyway.<br /><br />But the real beauty of this film is how Nolan tells the story. It&#x27;s not
as confusing as you may think, but it&#x27;s definitely as smart as you&#x27;ve
been hearing. Even when he&#x27;s giving you a lot, I was still able to
understand especially when it gets to the end. And the final shot will
definitely get you talking.<br /><br />Inception triggers the senses. It brings you into this world,
challenges you, makes you think, and doesn&#x27;t spoon feed you. It&#x27;s
definitely the best movie I&#x27;ve seen in a long time, and definitely is a
great movie experience. You definitely need to go see this film, which
is the best film of the year so far, and I&#x27;ll definitely be revisiting
this world very soon.<br /><br />Inception gets a 10/10.
