The most awaited movie of this year and probably one of the best movies
of this decade. There are some negative reviews of this movie, even in
Rotten tomatoes, some people rated it as Rotten. But they are very
little. And there are 90% positive reviews every where. One thing i
noted in these years of watching movies is, there are some movies that
cannot be reviewed as good or bad in one view. Some movies deserves
more than three watches too. Some movies of that type according to me
are Memento, the prestige, Mulholland.Dr , Donnie darko, and a lot
more. The recent one to join this list is Inception. Ya i watched this
movie and I&#x27;m pretty sure about the concept and the mental exercise
being involved here in this movie as Nolan&#x27;s early movies. They require
multiple viewing. Even three is not enough for memento. Each time you
watch that movie, you will find some thing new and surprising that u
missed it in the first place. Inception is not so complex as memento
but more like prestige. here he deals with dreams and dream within
dream and even the next level. And they are just synchronized with the
viewing angle of the viewers. Christopher Nolan did this thing nearly
perfect. Dicaprio getting shaped with movie after movie in his
performance, though this is a directors movie, he scored equally for
giving what Nolan thought. And the other actors equally good in their
way of giving judgment to the movie. And the camera works and the sets
involved in this movie is awesome. Hans Zimmer did a wonderful job as
he was doing with his earlier movies. He deserves an Oscar for this
movie along with DiCaprio and Nolan for sure. I&#x27;ve watched this movie
twice and I&#x27;m pretty sure, I&#x27;m gonna watch it again and I&#x27;ll find this
movie more refreshing with a next view.
