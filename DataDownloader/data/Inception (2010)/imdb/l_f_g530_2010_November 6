2010_November 6 
I just saw this movie, and I must say that I am really impressed by the
quality of the scenario and the attention to the detail, despite making
a big budget and a big box office success movie, Nolan manages to make
an &#x22;author&#x22;film at the same time.<br /><br />I think this film (it had already started a bit with the Dark Knight)
will be regarded as a change in cinema history in a few years, this is
a statement by Nolan that you can make a film with deep philosophical
implications and still get a success out of it, it&#x27;s pretty sad that
some low budget masterpieces keep going under the radar because they&#x27;re
not filled with explosions and flashy stuff (wich Nolan just masters at
a new level with this movie), but that&#x27;s how it seems to work, at least
Nolan forces the public to get quality entertainment instead of going
to another Micheal Bay movie. Let&#x27;s just hope some people will now be
more exigent towards Hollywood and they won&#x27;t let some untalented
directors and script-writers get away easily (don&#x27;t get me wrong
there&#x27;s still a lot of other good movies coming out of Hollywood, but
some people are just going to cinema if there&#x27;s some big boobs or some
guy walking by an explosion on the poster).<br /><br />About the movie itself, like I said, the scenario is really solid,
complex, interesting, built around unanswered questions, filled with
details... This kind of scenario goes by really rarely, it&#x27;s just sad
that this movie was limited in time because some characters were not
developed deeply enough and some stuff may appear incoherent if it&#x27;s
not explained, but I can&#x27;t judge because it could be Nolan&#x27;s will or it
could be that in modern cinema producers don&#x27;t let you do 6 hours
movies because you loose a lot of auditors after 2-3 hours, anyways
there&#x27;s maybe like 50 books in the surface of the earth that truly have
no issues... Nolan keeps on messing with our heads and to create new
elements to question without even giving answers (yeah I hate him right
now), it&#x27;s just a brilliant scenario with a lot of depth and a really
interesting vision of the human mind.<br /><br />The directing of the movie is also really good, although Nolan is not
David Lynch (maybe because he doesn&#x27;t want to be...) and the directing
is more based on great storytelling and special effects (wich like I
said he master perfectly) than on aesthetics and subtle camera and
cinematographic effects, in other words the realisation bets more on a
&#x22;wow effect&#x22; that it messes up with your head. That is not a reproach
because I think that is what makes the movie a big step forward in
Hollywood cinema, it&#x27;s the best of both worlds: Lynch/Cohens meets Bay;
I might have liked the movie better if it wasn&#x27;t aimed to be an
industrial success, but I respect the decision to deliver quality
entertainment to the &#x22;mass&#x22; (ok now I&#x27;m starting to sound like a
pretentious do*che).<br /><br />Also, I appreciated the acting a lot, Dicaprio (Cobbs) keeps getting
better and he was already great(god this guys must take a break if he
doesn&#x27;t want to go crazy after this and Shutter Island), Cotillard
(Cobbs wife) pulls of, again, a great performance, Watanabe (the
Asiatic) plays his mysterious role in a great way, Gordon-Levitt (Cobbs
friend?) is pretty good, but is character is just too mysterious (I
just don&#x27;t get his relation with Cobb), Page (the architect (is that me
or that sounds like a reference to Matrix)) is good, but her role being
important I think it could have been better (still she&#x27;s pretty young
and I&#x27;m in no place to judge), and the rest of the casting was just
great even if some of the roles were not &#x22;deep&#x22;.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is a must-see even if you&#x27;re just watching
for the scenario or the flashy &#x22;eye-candy&#x22; stuff, but expect to finish
this movie with more questions than answers. (when you see the film
you&#x27;ll get the title, and by the way sorry for the mistakes English
isn&#x27;t my maternal language)
