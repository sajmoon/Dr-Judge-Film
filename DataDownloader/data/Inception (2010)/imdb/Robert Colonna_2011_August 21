Christopher Nolan has done it again. Inception is a true masterpiece.
This movie has made it into my top 5 favorite movies of all time. The
story line is just outstanding. Every quality of the movie was amazing.
This movie is a must see. I do have to say, it&#x27;s not the easiest movie
to understand. It took 2 or 3 times before I understood every detail
about the movie. In order to understand it, you have to stay focused to
every word in the movie, so you don&#x27;t miss something their saying.<br /><br />To sum the movie up, it is perfect. I can&#x27;t think of any cons about it.
Some might think that there are useless scenes, and that they could
have done without them, but the scenes are needed in order to fully
understand the story. The cast is perfect for their characters and are
all amazing actors. One thing that made the movie so special was how
suspenseful it was. With a lot of action, and a lot of things going on,
you really get drawn into the experience. <br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to give the ending away, but the ending was amazing. Why
some people think the ending was awful and ruined the movie, I believe
it made the movie even better. It made you really think about the movie
and take in what just happened. It was an amazing experience, and I&#x27;d
recommend the movie to anyone who likes Christopher Nolan, or even
anyone who likes movies.
