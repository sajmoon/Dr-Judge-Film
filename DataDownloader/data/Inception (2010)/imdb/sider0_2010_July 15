All I could manage to say as I left the theater was, &#x22;That was
awesome!&#x22; This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the
story to the acting to the action, there wasn&#x27;t anything lacking from
this film. There are so many layers, not only in the plot but in the
depth of story telling that go on in this film. I don&#x27;t know how he fit
so much story into a couple of hours and still it can make perfect
sense. This is a movie you can watch 10 times, and I probably will, and
still catch something you didn&#x27;t see before. It was so easy to get
caught up and forget you were in a theater and not actually in the room
with the characters. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so immersed
in a film. I actually had to remind myself occasionally that it was
only a movie. I loved everything about this. The action sequences were
just amazing, I don&#x27;t think these things have ever been done in film
before. It was like watching a perfectly done live action video game.
The mind twisting story keeps you guessing till the end, and even
after. There was even a tragic but heart warming love story in the
middle. To fit all of this into a film is just incredible. My advice to
anyone, is to find the biggest screen in a theater you can and go see
this movie. I don&#x27;t even think an IMax screen is big enough for this
gnarly piece of cinema.
