It is shocking to me sometimes to sit and watch these kind of movies.
for starters, it&#x27;s obvious that the only thing the script writers could
think of is the dream concept, nothing more. so, if you have one idea,
why not use it over and over till every one thinks it&#x27;s clever? so the
story is basically about a guy going into another guy&#x27;s dream, then
into a dream within a dream, then into a dream within a dream then -
you guessed it. it&#x27;s not smart, and without it, i doubt they could have
gotten more then an hour out of this story line, but add the &#x22;awsome
complexity&#x22; (for a 2 year old monkey) of a dream within a dream and
they got a 2 and a half!! hour movie.<br /><br />now to the acting - doesn&#x27;t exist, sorry. some how, Leonardo D gets
more movies although he can&#x27;t act. the side kicks next to him learned
the trade quite fast and they too don&#x27;t believe in acting. in fact, the
only acting you get through out the movie is when you see the extras,
they were great. why not shoot leonardo and replace him with one of the
extras? good question<br /><br />that being said, i would recommend watching it once, for the effects
and shooting, that&#x27;s all this movie is good for. and please, don&#x27;t
think it&#x27;s a smart movie, that only makes you look like an idiot
