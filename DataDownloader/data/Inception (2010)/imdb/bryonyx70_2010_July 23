I honestly couldn&#x27;t have gone into a cinema with higher expectations,
and I can openly admit that I didn&#x27;t expect Inception to come even
close to the bar I had set it, but, against all odds, it succeeded with
flying colours. <br /><br />Inception is the story of a tormented man, Dom Cobb (Leonardo
DiCaprio), who with a team of experts, uses the technology they have to
enter the subconscious mind, and steal the ideas that lie there, for
money. So basically, a sci-fi type heist gang. Which, on paper, sounds
intriguing, if but a little silly. <br /><br />However, Christopher Nolan pulls it off here with such a tremendous
amount of energy and a somewhat complex although beautiful plot. The
last hour in particular is literally incredible, I can say with full
certainty that even a science fiction hater, will be on the edge of
their seat. For me personally, it was the terrific blend of Cobb&#x27;s
forgotten life, the stunning special effects and the psychological
essence that combines to make just an amazing movie.<br /><br />I know the film will be criticised for the idea of it trying to be the
next Matix where reality is not all as it&#x27;s seems. However, it is not
like that at all, and Inception is entirely it&#x27;s own movie, with it&#x27;s
own plot and set of characters who you emphasise with. In particular, I
thought the cast did portray all their roles very effectively, with
Marion Cottilard portraying Cobb&#x27;s estranged wife Mal beautifully, as
does DiCaprio, although he does need to spend less time frowning. I
also think Joseph Gordon- Levitt and Cillian Murphury portray their
roles effectively too. <br /><br />On the downside, Ellen Page is simply not convincing enough to take on
the complexity of her character, as she just feels too young and
inexperienced to play the clever Ariadane. I also have to admit that a
few times the story does cross the line between complex but hooking, to
a little silly, but it always manages to bounce back to keeping you on
the ball again. <br /><br />But overall, it is one of the best, most fascinating, and down right
incredible movies I have seen in a long time, and I just have to say
well done to Christopher Nolan to creating such a masterpiece, and it
is amazing to see a person who just manages to get better an better
with each movie he makes.
