Greetings again from the darkness. Some movies are made as pure visual
entertainment. Others are made as a vision of a story. The best combine
elements of both. The great ones WOW you with what you see on screen,
while keeping your mind focused on the multiple dimensions of a story
that just won&#x27;t let you get ahead. The previous sentence is my feeble
attempt at describing what happens during &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />Writer/director Christopher Nolan turns 40 at the end of this month. He
now has 3 instant-classic films to his credit: &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22; and now &#x22;Inception&#x22;. I am not a good enough writer to describe
just how talented he his at making films. What I can tell you is that
this movie gave me a &#x22;runner&#x27;s high&#x22; ... it put me &#x22;in the zone&#x22;. As a
viewer, I felt in perfect sync at each twist and turn.<br /><br />There are two pieces of advice I will offer. First, go see the film at
a theatre on the big screen. Don&#x27;t wait for NetFlix. Second, pay
attention to every scene and every line. Trust Mr. Nolan to take you on
this wild ride. You may be able to figure out the ending (if there even
is one), but you will have missed the real point of the film ... how
did you get here? Here is a brief synopsis: Leonardo DiCaprio plays an
expert thief. He is a thief who steals ideas by infiltrating the dreams
of his targets and snatching their ideas. A very wealthy tycoon played
by Ken Watanabe hires DiCaprio for a risky project of Inception - the
inserting of an idea into the subject&#x27;s mind through dreams, rather
than the stealing of an idea. DiCaprio&#x27;s team is played by Joseph
Gordon-Levitt (with physical brilliance while lacking gravitational
force), Tom Hardy (from Rocknrolla), master chemist Dileep Rao, and new
recruit Ellen Page (Juno plays a brilliant architect prodigy with a
genius of space and dimension). Cillian Murphy plays the target and
Michael Caine is DiCaprio&#x27;s father in law ... the link between who Leo
is now and his previous life with his wife, played hauntingly well by
Marion Cotillard.<br /><br />A perfect Nolan touch is Ellen Page&#x27;s character name - Ariadne. A quick
google finds that Ariadne, in Greek mythology, fell in love with
Theseus and helped him escape Minotaur&#x27;s labyrinth. The film is full of
mazes and is itself a labyrinth punctuated by a stunning and powerful
score by Hans Zimmer. You will find yourself bouncing from dream to
reality, jumping into another&#x27;s dreams, layering dreams upon each other
... oh, and watching a mind-bending special effect as the city of Paris
is folded over on top of itself.<br /><br />Clear your mind for 2 and a half hours and let a terrific filmmaker
take you on a journey through mindspace that we never really pay
attention to. The payoff is dream-like.
