What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites
hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out?
Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we
looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills!
Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the
thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just
might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also
contains something we often don&#x27;t look for...brains! &#x22;What is the most
resilient parasite? An idea&#x22; says Leonardo Di Caprio&#x27;s character Cobb.
Well, Inception is all about ideas. It&#x27;s all right there in the title.
The film central idea revolves around &#x22;Extractors&#x22;, who are paid to
extract secrets from people&#x27;s subconscious minds by sneaking into their
dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when
one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate
rival, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is born. The less said about this film the better.
It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a
piece of the film&#x27;s genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly
and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence
simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the
power of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s script which, I imagine, is likely to get
overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But
everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the
ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny
resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio&#x27;s other instant classic this
year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a
traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to
watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of
reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter
Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less
alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese&#x27;s film. There
is not a single dull moment in Nolan&#x27;s film. There is style, charm and
intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is
pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph
Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into
undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless
performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be
living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large
amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make
use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which
are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these
days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy
(femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful
suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why
cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it&#x27;s OK to watch this
film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of
it. Not to be missed on the big screen!
