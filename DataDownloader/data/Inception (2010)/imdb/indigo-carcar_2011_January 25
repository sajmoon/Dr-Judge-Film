I&#x27;ve been waiting for a movie that would blow my mind. This movie did
just that. FINALLY, here&#x27;s a movie with real depth and interest. A very
original and exciting plot, from beginning to end, I couldn&#x27;t stop
watching.<br /><br />First of all, like I said, the plot is incredible and original. Though
completely outrageous, it explains everything in a way that&#x27;s
believable.<br /><br />The only thing &#x22;bad&#x22; (that&#x27;s not really bad, actually) is also the
thing that&#x27;s so good about it. Because it&#x27;s so complex, you&#x27;ll either
love this or become so confused that you just get frustrated... My mom
watched this for an hour, then just gave up and turned it off. Then I
watched it, making sure to concentrate on every detail they brought up,
and by the end I was so amazed and overwhelmed that I made an account
on this site just to write about how amazing it is. Really, this movie
is incredible! Maybe it&#x27;s hard for some to grasp the first time around,
but if you pay close attention, it&#x27;s thrilling.<br /><br />10/10
