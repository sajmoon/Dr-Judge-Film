2011_March 26 
As many reviewers have noted, this summer movie season...well, it&#x27;s
almost not deserving of being called a summer movie season at all.
Sequels. Remakes. Reboots. Rehashes. Re-what-have-yous. Granted, they
were not all bad, but neither were they all good. Along comes
Christopher Nolan, Savior of the movie universe, with Inception.<br /><br />The psychological action-thriller centers on Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a
skilled &#x22;extractor&#x22;. Cobb is a master of a specific kind of corporate
espionage: he enters peoples&#x27; minds while they are asleep to retrieve
secrets from their dreams.<br /><br />Cobb and his partner Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) are approached by the
wealthy Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform &#x22;inception&#x22;: planting an idea
instead of stealing one. Their target is Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian
Murphy), the son of a terminally-ill tycoon. Saito wants Fischer to
disband his father&#x27;s empire.<br /><br />However, Dom is a deeply troubled individual, and with valid reason: he
is wanted for the supposed murder of his wife Mallorie (Cotillard), and
visions of his wife manifest themselves in the dreams Dom enters. Being
a fugitive, Dom is unable to return to their children.<br /><br />Dom assembles a team to help perform the inception, consisting of
Arthur, college graduate and &#x22;dream architect&#x22; Ariadne (Ellen Page),
&#x22;forger&#x22; Eames (Tom Hardy) who impersonates others within a dream,
Yusuf (Dileep Rao) the &#x22;chemist&#x22; who formulates the drugs needed to
enter the dream state and Saito himself, as a &#x22;tourist&#x22; in the dream
world.<br /><br />And then things get (even more) complex.<br /><br />In many ways, Inception, despite its mind-bending premise, is classic
Christopher Nolan. Memento, Insomnia and the Prestige all display
similar traits in that they enjoy playing with the audiences&#x27; minds.
However, Nolan is a director who learns, and after gaining the
experience of the big-budget Batman films, is able to translate his
ideas into mind-blowing spectacle.<br /><br />Inception exemplifies the thinking man&#x27;s blockbuster, and it is very
rare that filmmakers of tent-pole summer fare treat their audiences
like geniuses. After scores of films that are so painfully dumbed-down,
it doesn&#x27;t hurt to watch a brain cell-jolting flick like this one once
in a while.<br /><br />Inception operates on its visuals: the notion that anything is possible
within the world of the dream allowed production designer Guy Hendrix
Dyas to go wild. The film includes such scenes as an entire city
folding in on itself, a freight train running through a city, an
assault on a fortress that wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in a Bond movie and
a desolate, abandoned dream city filled with crumbling buildings. One
of the many great sequences in the film is a zero-gravity fight scene
performed by Gordon-Levitt along the corridors of a hotel. Even for
audiences jaded by the proliferation of &#x22;wire-fu&#x22; since the Matrix
films, it&#x27;s exciting.<br /><br />Inception&#x27;s greatest asset however is arguably its emotional core that
functions like a rope guiding the viewer through the labyrinth of
story. Leonardo DiCaprio has carved a career out of playing
emotionally-complex characters, Cobb indeed brings to mind DiCaprio&#x27;s
recent performance in Shutter Island. Cotillard is also commendable in
that it&#x27;s never easy to play a character who exists only as a figment
of another character&#x27;s imagination, and Cotillard does this hauntingly
well.<br /><br />The rest of the cast, too, is an iron-clad ensemble. There is literally
not one weak link, everybody is perfectly cast. Gordon-Levitt
especially seems to be emerging as a bona fide movie star, after making
a name for himself in smaller character films. Watanabe manages to be
dignified yet possess a misleading sinister streak as the employer and
money man.<br /><br />Tom Hardy is a hoot as the comic relief who is actually really useful.
My favorite however (it could be just that I&#x27;m a 17-year-old male) is
the lovely Ellen Page, who has no problems portraying the youngest yet
deepest character in the film. My only complaint with regards to the
cast is that Michael Caine, as Cobb&#x27;s mentor and father-in-law, is
woefully underused.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re tired of being insulted by blockbusters that throw money at
the screen and hope it sticks, then treat yourself to one of the best
cinematic uses of money ever. There&#x27;s no shortage of spectacle or
intelligence in what I can safely say the best movie of the year. And
it&#x27;s only July! Or is it...
