there are some great ideas that blow your mind when you first see them
on screen. in the inception genre, matrix did that. it was fresh and
left an impact long after one had seen the movie. great plot,
screenplay, direction, editing... the &#x27;dream&#x27; idea had that potential
but inception hardly does justice to it. the plot is not engaging, it&#x27;s
confusing. the action sequences are lame and clich&#xE9;d and hardly grab
you. there are some nice special effects but for them you don&#x27;t need to
see the movie, the trailer is enough. i wonder what&#x27;s wrong with movie
watchers. they have played right into the hands of the marketing team
and bought the hype. rather than using their own sensibilities, i think
they are too embarrassed to call a lemon a lemon, fearing &#x27;how can i
call it bad when everyone is going ga ga over it.&#x27; a below average
movie, rated highly by below average audience.
