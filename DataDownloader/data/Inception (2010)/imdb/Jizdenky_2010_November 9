I had been awaiting the release of &#x27;Inception&#x27; for a long time and
finally the wait was over last night. I wanted to experience the movie
in 3D but alas, &#x27;would have to do with the normal version but
nonetheless &#x27;Inception&#x27; itself is a surreal experience. There&#x27;s hardly
anything like it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s got the classic heist action, the cat and mouse chase, the
exploration of dreams and new worlds but it&#x27;s the integration of such
elements into a different kind of exciting story that makes &#x27;Inception&#x27;
unique. Nolan&#x27;s execution is remarkable. The cinematography, visuals,
special effects, sound effects, editing, score and art direction are
exceptional. The principle cast deliver top notch performances.
Leonardo Dicaprio and Marion Cotillard are once again at their very
best. Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon Levitt,Cillian Murphy lend excellent
support while Michael Caine and Pete Poslethwaite are very effective in
their two scenes.<br /><br />On the flip side, given that the film revolves around dreams, I don&#x27;t
think Nolan went far enough with the exploration of it. The dream
sequences were too simplified. In addition, the Ellen Page character
didn&#x27;t feel very realistic. She barely showed any fear, fascination or
excitement when she discovers the changes she can make in a dream and
her creation was merely limited to architecture (a lack of
imagination). Her character is more of a tool for the writer to ask and
answer questions in order to simplify the story for the audience. In
addition, I found the ending to be a little too tame. Personally, I
would have preferred something darker and more complex.<br /><br />Yet, as I had mentioned earlier, it is a movie to be experienced just
for the world that Noland creates and involves you in.
