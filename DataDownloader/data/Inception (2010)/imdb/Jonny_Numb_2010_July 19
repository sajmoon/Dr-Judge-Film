I knew it was coming, and by the final frame of &#x22;Inception&#x22; my
strongest reaction was a compulsion to watch it all over again; and
this was something of a resentful feeling, as the motivator was not to
witness its stunning visuals synthesized in a tight narrative, but to
simply make SENSE of the narrative as it shoots off into increasingly
difficult directions (even within the illogic of the Dream-World our
characters inhabit for most of the film). Since his indie breakout
&#x22;Memento,&#x22; writer/director Christopher Nolan has ascended the ranks of
major Hollywood filmmaking, injecting his work with a sense of wonder
and intelligence; yet like &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; (a great, yet somewhat
flawed film) my feelings toward &#x22;Inception&#x22; (those I can clearly
rationalize, that is) wind up a few notches below where I believe they
should be. While the film -- centered around a group of &#x22;dream hackers&#x22;
(headed by Leonardo DiCaprio) looking to plant an idea in a corporate
heir&#x27;s (Cillian Murphy) headspace -- has its share of visually stunning
setpieces and fascinating ideas (it&#x27;s nice to see some Jungian concepts
get their toes wet -- if not immersed -- here), the ultimate result is
overlong, overindulgent, and marked by distracting, unsatisfying
diversions (the prime offender being the haunted, memory-based
relationship between DiCaprio and wife Marion Cotillard) and leaden
exposition that completely deadens a sometimes-glacial pace. And for a
film about dreams and their origin in the mind, Nolan&#x27;s action-movie
transitions come across as counterintuitive: instead of reminding us of
the jagged inconsistency and incoherence of dreams, the jerky cutting
merely comes across as...well, just incoherent (which becomes
particularly tiresome when the film dissolves into
dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream action-movie territory in the final
act). &#x22;Inception&#x22; is most fascinating in its first hour, which lays the
ground rules of dream-logic and how dream-worlds &#x22;work&#x22;; once it
settles into the main plot, it derails somewhat, and it soon becomes
clear that Nolan, in his attempt to not only dazzle, thrill, and
stimulate the collective consciousness of the viewer, but build on the
astronomical expectations established by &#x22;The Dark Knight,&#x22; has a reach
that far surpasses his grip.
