2011_April 4 
In my eyes this movie was awful. Now most people who I&#x27;ve told my
opinion have accused me of being &#x22;simple&#x22; and &#x22;not understanding it&#x22;. I
believe I understood the movie very well, I appreciate Nolan&#x27;s original
idea and effort. It&#x27;s just a shame that this idea is a piece of
garbage. I enjoy intelligent movies, but there is nothing intelligent
or even remotely exciting about people going into dreams, and then into
dreams, and then into dreams again. The whole idea is simply
ridiculous, and when Leonardo and Ariadne are in a dream together and
Ariadne starts moving a huge glass door around - what on earth? Moving
on to Leonardo, I cannot understand how such a poor, boring and
depressive actor gets so much fame. I&#x27;m assuming this is all because of
Titanic, but his role in Inception is shockingly boring and bad. And am
I the only one who seems to see a pattern in Leo&#x27;s movies (in both
Inception and Shutter Island Leonardo&#x27;s wife is dead, but he seems to
think that she isn&#x27;t)? Anyway, out of all the cast only Tom Hardy
playing Eames is remotely likable. After seeing Cilian Murphy in some
other brilliant roles (e.g. 28 Days Later) I was extremely disappointed
while watching him become more miserable with every second in
Inception. Leonardo&#x27;s sidekick Arthur is plain annoying. I wish there
had been more action in this movie other than in the scene in the snowy
place. Aside from that, Inception is just a lot of talking about
complete nonsense and lots of views of Leonardo&#x27;s scared, confused
face. Christopher Nolan made this movie way too &#x22;intelligent&#x22;. The end
result is tragic. One of the most overrated movies ever.
