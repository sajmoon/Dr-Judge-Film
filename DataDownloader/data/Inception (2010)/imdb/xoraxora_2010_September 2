This is by far my most disappointing movie experience in years. Its not
really that its that bad. I would probably have given it 7 stars if it
wasn&#x27;t for the unbelievable 9.1 average, which sent me to the theater
with such high expectations.<br /><br />First of all, I have to get this of my chest: ITS NOT THAT ORIGINAL! In
1998 a by-now-forgotten film by the title of Dark City was released,
with a strikingly similar premise, but with better writing, a tighter
plot and a fraction of the budget of this monstrosity. Do yourself a
favor, watch it.<br /><br />Back to Inception: The casting is good, the performances vary between
average to good, and in general they more or less work together. But
the characters lack any real depth, the dialog is mediocre and the
pervasive pseudo-science conversations are down-right silly.<br /><br />Visually its stunning, ground-breaking, with more special effects than
you could ever wish for, but quite often pointless. The same goes for
the action sequences, amazing yes, but often out of place and you can&#x27;t
shake the feeling that they were forced into the plot: OK guys, its
been three minutes since something exploded or someone used a grenade
launcher, stuff an action scene in here.<br /><br />Worst of all: the premise of the film is ridiculous but there is
nothing that makes it believable. This, I think, is the mark of a great
Sci-Fi flick: you completely buy into the premise no matter how
ridiculous it is. Inception fails.<br /><br />Does it have better entertainment value/ is it a better film than:<br /><br />Shutter Island: No, but comes close/ No, doesn&#x27;t even come close<br /><br />District 9: No, D9 is 3 times more fun/ No, God No, in what dreamworld?<br /><br />Clash of the Titans: Yes/ Yes<br /><br />The A-Team: About the same/ Yes, its better than The A-Team<br /><br />Avatar: No/ No<br /><br />Finally, Dark City: bang-for-buck, Yes/ No, even though Dark City has a
weaker cast its still the better movie,
