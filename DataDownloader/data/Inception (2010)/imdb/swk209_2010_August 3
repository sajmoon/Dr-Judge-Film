I saw this movie twice and I loved it both times. It has great acting
and is very entertaining. It was very intellectually stimulating,
whether it entirely made sense based on current dream theories and
hypotheses or not. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. A
must-see move.<br /><br />I encourage those who are reading and writing reviews to rate the movie
based on the movie, and not subject to the hype or current reviews of
the movie.<br /><br />Those who give inception or any other movie a lower rating than they
know it deserves (ie 1/10) should rethink their rating strategy and try
to gain attention somewhere else. Review the movie for the movie, not
because you need to be heard.
