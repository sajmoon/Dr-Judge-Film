A note before reading this: unfortunately IMDb has a 1000 word limit on
all reviews, so when I wrote my original review that was 1800 words, I
had to cut out a lot of paragraphs. If you would like to read the
review in its entirety you can find it here:
http://www.tracktalk.net/inception/review<br /><br />The film is centered around a skilled thief...(See full review)<br /><br />(see full review for this paragraph)<br /><br />However after the movie was finished I was left with a feeling that
surprised me. You see usually after I see a great movie (with good
fulfilling characters) I get this satisfied feeling. After I watched
the Shawshank Redemption for the first time I felt satisfied. The story
doesn&#x27;t have to be happy or positive to elicit this rewarding feeling,
it just has to have full characters that I feel/care for. <br /><br />After I realized I was left with this unfulfilled feeling I tried to
narrow it down as to what exactly caused this. Then it hit me. I
couldn&#x27;t remember a single characters name besides the main character,
Cobbs, and Saito (and this was only because Saitio&#x27;s name was uttered
within the last 5-10 minutes of the film). I also realized that I
didn&#x27;t really care about any of the characters. If Andy had been killed
after his prison escape in Shawshank, I probably would have cried (and
I am by no means a person that is considered &#x22;emotional&#x22; especially
when it comes to movies), but if the entire ensemble had been
ruthlessly gunned down in a slow-mo fashion zooming up 10x on open
mouths and slowly dripping tears - well I wouldn&#x27;t have blinked twice,
never mind getting teary eyed. This in fact might have actually
happened albeit it was in a dream and therefore doesn&#x27;t count. Another
thing I want to add in is that while some people say it&#x27;s an original
work, the concept of Inception is not really original. Nolan even said
in an interview that he was inspired by The Matrix, Dark City,
Thirteenth Floor, and many other films in the 90&#x27;s era (which is when
he roughly started working on the script - 1998).<br /><br />Inception is a thriller/heist movie (officially labeled as
Thriller/Sci-Fi), so almost by default the movie embraces the
stereotypical cloud that usually surrounds thrillers. And by that I
mean the superficial cloud that surrounds most thrillers. Which, lets
be honest, is what the whole movie is. One big thriller till the very
end. And it&#x27;s not like all thrillers are intrinsically superficial with
its characters, we have a big list of movies that have done well with
its genre: Including but not limited to my favorite movie: Fight Club,
which while it didn&#x27;t have characters that I necessary cared for, it
had an overall theme to it that caught on like wild fire in my mind.
Something tangible that I could play around with and think about. More
important, it had a theme that drastically changed my life. That I
still abide by to this day. &#x22;When society tells you to conform to its
petty thinking and ways, you stiff it the big one and do things how you
believe you should&#x22; <br /><br />If I had to compare this movie to any other it would probably be a mix
of The Martix (which Nolan actually said was part of his inspiration),
Surrogates, and especially Inglourious Basterds. Surrogates &#x26; Matrix in
that the concept is similar and Inglourious Basterds in that it&#x27;s a fun
ride but after you leave the movie theater you aren&#x27;t really affected
or look at the world in a different way. A good movie in my opinion
should do a few things: create relatable characters that tell an
interesting story packed with a theme or message (which Inception
didn&#x27;t really have. Maybe that the sub-conscious is better left alone?)
and while also leaving the film open to more than one interpretation
(not a requirement, but usually allows us to create our own meaning
with the film)<br /><br />There were two particular comments that stuck in my mind before I saw
Inception. One was on rottentomato.com labeled &#x22;A giant waste of Time&#x22;,
the other on IMDb.com labeled<br /><br />something like &#x22;A Movie that makes Dumb People Feel Smart&#x22;. At the time
I resented both statements. But later, days after I saw the movie, I
got to thinking - maybe there is a morsel of truth to these low-blow
reviews. Now, as I write this review I interpret those two comments as
(and I have to interpret the title as I never got around to reading the
full reviews) as<br /><br />&#x22;so while all the awesome mind blowing scenes helps push the plot
further along, it doesn&#x27;t do one thing: progress or develop the
characters.&#x22; and the second comment about &#x22;dumb people feeling smart&#x22;
which is very uncalled for, I interpret this one as: the film does all
the thinking for you. Going back to the wasted actions scenes though,
this could have been better spent to help the audience understand the
supporting cast. Heck even the main character. I mean Cobbs gets
fleshed out a bit as we learn that he is doing all this for his kids
and wife, but that is about it (and even then I didn&#x27;t care for his
character). And so by the end of the movie: Cobb, Arthur, Ariadne,
Eames, Saito, Yusuf,<br /><br />Fischer &#x26; browning become no more to us than characters that we can&#x27;t
relate to that are apart of a story that we can&#x27;t really relate to that
doesn&#x27;t really relay any theme or message that might better us or
enlighten us about anything (perhaps we learn a little bit more about
dreaming?).<br /><br />(See full review for the last three paragraphs)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my first ever movie review<br /><br />Cheers email - nehmanator333@msn.com
