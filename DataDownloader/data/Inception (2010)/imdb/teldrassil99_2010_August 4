You might think that a movie that literally sets itself up to play with
people&#x27;s dreams would have a broad vision and try to break through
boundaries. But sadly, an engaging start to the film quickly leads to a
sense of claustrophobia, as the viewer is forced down an increasingly
predictable sequence of action scenes. And while the action is
certainly well choreographed and executed, it&#x27;s nothing that we haven&#x27;t
seen before.<br /><br />Worse, the run-on exposition by the characters, who are constantly
reciting (and then literally re-citing) the Rules of the
Inceptionverse, leaves precious little to actually think about. This
film is not awful, but it&#x27;s also far from being the deep and
thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece that some viewers would have
you believe.<br /><br />Go in with lower expectations, and you might be less disappointed :-)
