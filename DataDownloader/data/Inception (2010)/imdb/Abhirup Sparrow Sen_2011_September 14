&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a film which you can watch from many perspectives. It
can be named as a fiction.....or it can be named to be a reality based
flick..... A great narrative structure combined with overwhelming
performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Ellen Page, Joseph Grodon-Levitt,
and others....... Its a film of various dimensions.......and various
measures of thrill rides...... And especially look out for the Dream
Construction sequences. A very different film if compared to Nolan&#x27;s
other flicks, but a very contemporary concept. Di Caprio&#x27;s one of the
best performances till date. Last but not the least...... &#x22;There&#x27;s a
train coming..... Lookout!&#x22;.....
