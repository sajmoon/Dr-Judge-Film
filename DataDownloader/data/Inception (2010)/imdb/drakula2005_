I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great
miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i&#x27;ll
definitely do the same with Inception.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and
multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by
most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and
captivated by the genius, that&#x27;s hidden behind it.And not just
directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with
acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.<br /><br />When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal
favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is
the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman
Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.<br /><br />The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one
could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless
action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have
to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on
which thing are happening are so many, that one surely&#x27;ll miss
something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience,
but i hope that won&#x27;t happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite
directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks
aren&#x27;t all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and
still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it&#x27;s not all
lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is
still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless,
constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.<br /><br />Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots,
sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see
something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely
will be Nolan&#x27;s latest masterpiece! My Grade won&#x27;t change-it&#x27;s the same
for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!
