This is an extraordinary film based upon little-known information about
consciousness and the afterlife. The film was written and directed by
the remarkable British director Christopher Nolan, whose previous films
have included such inspired, original, and challenging ones as
FOLLOWING (1998, see my review), which was a work of pure genius,
MEMENTO (2000), and THE PRESTIGE (2006). Nothing seems to be known
about where Nolan obtained his information, but INCEPTION could not
have been written without some pretty unusual sources, and one wonders
whether he regularly consults psychics, or just how he went about his
research. No other writing credit is listed for the film, so Nolan
seems to have done all this on his own. The film features many fine
performances, but there was one false note: I did think that the late
Pete Postlethwaite was absolutely wrong for the role of the dying man,
but then he really was dying at the time, and one hesitates to speak
ill of the dead, especially of a man who bravely went on acting until
the last moment of his life and who in that sense achieved a personal
heroic stature in his profession, and is respected by all. Marion
Cotillard was an inspired choice for the role of the dead wife, and her
performance is suitably spooky, moody, and disturbingly atmospheric.
She has us on edge all the time, which is appropriate to the story.
Michael Caine has a cameo role, for which he was highly suitable. The
Japanese actor Ken Watanabe has a prominent role in the film, and he
does very well except for one thing, namely his mangled English. He
really does need more speech lessons. It was not always possible to
understand what he was saying. The film ultimately succeeds because of
a very strong and commanding performance by Leonardo Dicaprio, who has
matured into a very solid and believable leading man and is no longer
the boy of yesteryear. He has obviously kept himself from going over
the edge with youthful &#x27;star vanity&#x27;, and has concentrated on remaining
a good actor for the rest of his career. That must have taken a very
great deal of self-control. Ellen Page, best known for her title role
in JUNO (2007), was a rather unobvious choice for the girl, as she
offers no glamour and is very much a working actress who is far from
being seductive and just gets on with her job. No director would choose
her as the love interest in a movie, as she makes no hearts throb. But
it works out well, as Dicaprio has to remain obsessively in love with
the weirdly wonderful Marion Cotillard, and cannot be distracted by
something cute in a skirt, or it would have ruined the story. Anyway,
Page wears trousers all the time, just to be on the safe side and keep
the temperature down. This film makes effective use of spectacular
special effects, which must have required an immense amount of
planning, and they are fantastically effective. So this film is a real
phenomenon; score one more for Nolan. Some of the inspiration for the
story comes from obvious sources, such as the highly-publicised work of
American &#x27;spooks&#x27; in remote viewing and attempts at directed dreaming.
The extraction of information from dreaming people is a kind of natural
consequence of such activities. But Nolan has gone far deeper, and this
is very far from being a superficial exploitation picture based on
familiar, if imperfectly understood, information from popular books.
After all, what has been publicly revealed is misleading in two senses:
first, we are encouraged to believe that all that &#x27;stuff&#x27; ended long
ago in the 1980s and was abandoned because it could not be controlled
properly and was too frivolous, and secondly that it had no deeper
relevance to the true issues of consciousness, the &#x27;afterlife&#x27;, and
other levels or dimensionalities of existence which may intersect with
or impinge upon what we naively imagine to be the sole &#x27;reality&#x27;. It is
wrong to assume that &#x27;other levels of existence&#x27; would be wholly
immaterial, as there is a great deal of evidence to make it clear that
&#x27;the spiritual&#x27; is not &#x27;immaterial&#x27;, and that there is no pure
Cartesian dichotomy between what we falsely call &#x27;matter&#x27; and &#x27;spirit&#x27;.
The Chinese had a better understanding of the issue, as they never
adopted such a false dichotomy, and traditionally spoke of
&#x27;etherialised matter&#x27;. Nolan seems to be on the right track. Where will
he go next? If he would only stop making Batman films and get serious
again, it would be interesting to see his next major work and track his
progress further along the lines it seems to be taking. In this film we
have &#x27;three levels of dreaming&#x27; and we have &#x27;the bottom of dreaming&#x27;
which turns out to be another &#x27;level of reality&#x27; which he calls Limbo,
and describes as a &#x27;confused mass&#x27; where some of the dead are stuck in
a state of bewilderment. The density of the strange information
presented in this film is too much for most viewers to grasp in a
single viewing, nor is Nolan sufficiently explicit, but stops short in
most cases with being merely suggestive, in order to keep his thriller
moving right along. But what is really interesting about this film is
not the story, but the background, assumptions, and context of the
story. Nolan has thrown a huge indigestible &#x27;confused mass&#x27; of Limbo at
his viewers, and he needs to continue to untangle it and expound it in
further works. This film therefore sweeps along and works in that
sense, but it is far from being a perfect film, as it was too much to
squeeze into a single story, despite all the best efforts of everyone
concerned. We need to revisit these issues, as one film alone on this
subject is not enough. After all, Batman has sequels, so why can&#x27;t this
one as well?
