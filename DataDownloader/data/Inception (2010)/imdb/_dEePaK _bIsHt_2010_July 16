After experiencing NOLAN&#x27;s earlier works(The Prestige, Memento &#x26; Dark
Knight) i actually have a faith on INCEPTION. And guess what..... i was
absolutely right. INCEPTION is by most NOLAN&#x27;s finest combination of
storytelling &#x26; action at the same time with same pace. The amazing
concept of dreams and thieves mixed up in a very cinematic way that
take your breath away. The very first frame of the movie itself told
the audiences that they are watching something extraordinary. HANZ
ZIMMER awesome BG score keeps the movie alive and fantastic Visual Fx
makes it more real and terrific in every sense......<br /><br />so DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR... go and watch INCEPTION.........
