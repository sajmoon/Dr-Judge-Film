Christopher Nolan is basically my most favorite director ever ! I was
always waiting for his next film since his success with The Dark
Knight. And as I have been told, this movie was written by him. I never
thought a man with this kind of superior mind ever exist. His creative
thinking had caught him a lot of fans since he never had a failure
movie before. Inception is actually a very complicated movie which made
you thinking all the time through the movie. Movies that require a lot
of thinking mostly hated by viewers such as The Box which received low
ratings.<br /><br />However, you might think that you need to think hard when watching
Inception but it is actually not necessary. Honestly, I felt like quit
watching the movie since the first 10 minutes were impossible to
understand. And that is the beauty of this movie since once you watch
until the end, you will know everything about the beginning of the
movie. All you need is watch the movie until the end. You will be
surprised to like the movie all of a sudden when you finished watching
it. I never thought I&#x27;d ever like the movie when I started watching it.
But each and every minute explained more and more, which is a waste if
you left the movie even for a second.<br /><br />The acting was superb. All the actors did great especially Leonardo
DiCaprio which put a great impact on this movie. In this movie, all of
the actors are professional actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of
Summer), Ellen Page (Whip It), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later) and more
and more and more pros. There was absolutely no weakness of this film.
I don&#x27;t think Inception deserved 8.9 IMDb rating, I think at least 9.5
rating should be the lowest for this masterpiece. This movie is
actually the best movie of all time.
