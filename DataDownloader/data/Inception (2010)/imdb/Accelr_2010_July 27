Good cinema, very good cinema. The movie is built well, played well and
very well realized. For me, it presents a major defect: the lack of
dramatic art. The movie is during 148 minutes but I think that would
have be needed to have one hour furthermore to help the spectators to
become identified more with the characters. I find that the heroes of
the movie are not enough &#x22;worked&#x22;. What I like in movies generally, it
is when we have an ultra-precise idea of whom are the characters. In
Inception it is not the case. We enter at once the action and the
presentation, the psychology of the characters is just touched. I know
that all the movies cannot have 220 minutes as &#x22;Once upon a time in
America &#x22; where we follow the characters of their childhood in their
death but there I find that it goes too fast... In the same way I shall
have liked having a thorough explanation on the concept: who invented
the &#x22;machine&#x22; which allows to enter the dreams? And when? How Cobb
meets to live on this &#x22;business&#x22;? I find that this part misses cruelly.
Following the example of &#x22; matrix &#x22; which succeeds in making credible a
concept so complicated, &#x22;Inception&#x22; should have settled its concept
with regard to the current reality. It would have allowed the
spectators to become identified better with the characters. Chris Nolan
remains a big director but honestly I expected in better especially
after &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22;...
