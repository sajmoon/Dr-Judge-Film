I do not know how I am going to express the various pros and few cons
from Inception without revealing spoilers.But well...I will try my best
in order not to ruin this very interesting film experience to those who
have not seen it yet.<br /><br />To start with, I liked the performances from Inception very
much.Leonardo DiCaprio faces his character with naturalness and
conviction...in other words, he brings his character to life.The rest
of the actors make the same achievement.They are Joseph Gordon-Levitt
as the main character&#x27;s right-handed man; Ellen Page as an &#x22;architect&#x22;
of dream-like settings; Tom Hardy as a talented counterfeiter; Ken
Watanabe as the impassive Saito; Cillian Murphy, who perfectly
dominates what is, in my opinion, the most difficult character from the
film; and the great Michael Caine, even though what he does is
practically a cameo.<br /><br />As good as the cast is, the main pros (and cons) from Inception come
from the screenplay, which is a work of an unusual complexity which
makes the spectator to pay full attention, and even though it may seem
obtuse and matted, it in fact has a very precise logical sequence,
which is structured with an attention to every detail.Having said that,
I have to mention the presence of holes and inconsistencies which, in
my opinion, avoid the film from being excellent.The most important
problem comes from the action scenes.Do not misunderstand me...they are
exciting and thrilling by themselves.However, they introduce too many
rules in the world of dreams, and they make the &#x22;squeak&#x22; in the gears
from the narrative to be evident, at the same time they distract our
attention and interrupt the flow from the story.In order not to give
too many turns about that point (since I would necessarily have to
reveal spoilers), I will only say that the chases, shootouts and
explosions feel forced, and they tend to obstruct a well designed and
fluid story.<br /><br />However, even though I did not find it to be excellent, I think
Inception deserves a safe recommendation for all the previously
mentioned positive elements, and also because of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
perfect direction.It is not a perfect film experience, but it is worthy
to see it mainly because of the screenplay, because it is entertaining
at the same time it leaves the spectator thinking.
