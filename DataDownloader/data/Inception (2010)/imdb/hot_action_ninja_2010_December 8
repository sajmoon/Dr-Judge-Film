If there was ever a film to label as &#x22;overrated&#x22;, it would be The Dark
Knight. If there was ever another film to label as &#x22;overrated&#x22;, it
would be Inception. I just don&#x27;t understand what it is about
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s films but they have the tendency to receive large
amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.<br /><br />While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing
more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one
exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly
memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get
on with the review.<br /><br />Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take
place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky
special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to
watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting
and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and
this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.<br /><br />The story while somewhat original, wasn&#x27;t pulled off as smoothly as it
could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes
that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending,
these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what
the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a
better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.<br /><br />Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don&#x27;t
expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out
performance in Inception, I would definitely say it&#x27;s from Leo
Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he&#x27;s one of the
better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives
passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted,
and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.<br /><br />Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They&#x27;re some of
the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect
of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has
one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer.
The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in
making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It&#x27;s
definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of
the day it&#x27;s still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It
lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9
so great (now that&#x27;s a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi
films ever made).<br /><br />I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a
fun film that will also make them think a little bit.
