But it&#x27;s got its heart in the right place. First it&#x27;s too long by at
least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to
cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it&#x27;s not really
sci-fi, it&#x27;s more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is
what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that&#x27;s
highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both
memorable and essentially flawless.<br /><br />The acting&#x27;s all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is
capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s performance is
especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal
mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and
producers, but she&#x27;s a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could
barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can
tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don&#x27;t like for some reason.
Perhaps it&#x27;s just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an
almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an
&#x27;innocent&#x27;, and I don&#x27;t really agree, I would have preferred Dakota
Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she&#x27;s worldly and
knowing, but her I&#x27;d like to protect and get to know personally.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic.
Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising,
the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another
person&#x27;s mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock
on which most of our problems lay. A &#x27;shared dream&#x27; as portrayed here
would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted
here, I think, and that&#x27;s no small flaw in this film.
