There are hardly sufficient superlatives to describe this film.<br /><br />It is a work of genius, not only for its powerful emotional content but
in its treatment of fundamental philosophical questions that have
haunted people for millennia.<br /><br />This very solid narrative core is the superstructure supporting the
film&#x27;s eye-candy of impressive visual effects and action. Yet this
aspect of production never treats its audience as fools, and merely
drape the narrative complexity.<br /><br />Among all of this, the acting performances are entirely credible. The
cast that has proved itself to be extremely accomplished at handling
this material. This is no mean feat.<br /><br />Nolan has surpassed himself in both screenplay and direction.<br /><br />This is the best new production I&#x27;ve seen in many years. It will be an
&#x22;instant classic&#x22;, talked about for years to come.<br /><br />Inception is the sort of modern myth that we desperately need to
explore in this post-modern age.
