I&#x27;m rather happy so many people like this film. It confirms my opinion
of mankind. Other reviewers have pointed out the stupidity of this film
and I advise everybody to go to the &#x27;hated it&#x27; section of the reviews
at IMDb and read up a bit about the true nature of this movie. It
stinks. It is a corpse that has been underwater too long. It is
terrible. It&#x27;s just another Hollywood production with people running
from bullets and never getting hit while too loud droning music tries
to add tension where it is simply not there. Sure, there&#x27;s things
exploding and amazing visuals and allegations to human themes (without
of course ever becoming real human emotions; allegations are much safer
and more popular, because you don&#x27;t have to actually feel, you can just
sit back and go &#x27;oooooh, aren&#x27;t we amaaaaazing&#x27; - well, no, not
really), there are characters that are never ever real people - I
choose life over the dream here, really, and I hope my dreams never
become as lousy as what I see here. In my dreams I feel, I touch, I
smell. I dream music and books, I dream people, despair, tears. I dream
violence, pain, sex, even death. I have stupid dreams in which I simply
work, like I do all day. I sometimes run marathons and wake up
exhausted. All these dreams are dear to me, because they are me. This
film is not me, or anyone. Even my worst nightmare is preferable over
this. At least I feel something there. My tiniest memory of someone I
have loved is worth more than this film. A fragment of my capacity to
hurt has more energy than this. I could go on, but you get the drift. I
rarely give up on films, but this one I did. I quit after 45 minutes.
And no, I&#x27;m not going to give it another go. As Hemingway said: &#x27;I
don&#x27;t have to eat a whole bucket of snot, to know that it&#x27;s snot.&#x27; One
star for me trying to watch this.
