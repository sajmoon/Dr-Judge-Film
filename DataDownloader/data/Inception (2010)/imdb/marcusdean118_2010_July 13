Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale
sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true
original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.<br /><br />To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly
intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been
reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open
mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then
trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology
(although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then
Inception is seminal in it&#x27;s storytelling. With a 148 minute running
time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn&#x27;t
expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film
about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every
single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect
of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don&#x27;t worry.
They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and
unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action
set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story,
rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.<br /><br />With this complex movie in it&#x27;s high concept, a stellar cast is needed.
And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio,
perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as
his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to
be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb&#x27;s
emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all
shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually
non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his
confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish
as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she&#x27;s the next big
female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film
compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.<br /><br />Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as
expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and
one which blows The Prestige&#x27;s cinematic reveal out of the water. This
is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we&#x27;ve still got to wait a
whole two years before Batman 3.
