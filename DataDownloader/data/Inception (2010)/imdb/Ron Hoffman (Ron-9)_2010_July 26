Yes. It&#x27;s a great movie, but I kept having flashbacks to Shutter Island
and Memento. I do NOT see this movie in the top half of the top 250.
Yes - great story, great graphics, great action. But it was very slow
at times as we developed the explanation of what in the world was going
on. Very creative, but not a 10. And tell me why, again, we were skiing
all over the place at the end. Too many implausible moments. And who
were the bad guys chasing the group in the second level dream??? And
the young millionaire (son) says OK, I am in a dream and I agree that
we need to go to another dream. Hello?? I probably voted low because I
just did not see this as a 9 or 10 star.
