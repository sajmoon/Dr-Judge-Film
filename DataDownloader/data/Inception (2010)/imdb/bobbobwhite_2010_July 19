I gave this film a 7 due to its technical, acting and CGI innovation
and brilliance, but cannot recommend it as anything other than
attractive theoretical masturbation. It was great entertainment, but
that is all that it was. No story could be much further from reality
than this one was.<br /><br />As a scientist viewing it from a purely scientific position, the absurd
theory and its execution in this story would be approximately akin to
one postulating then expecting that &#x22;pregnant cows sent into space
would give birth to pigs and then return to earth as puppies water
skiing behind porpoises&#x22;.<br /><br />The above postulation is almost as absurd as this film story was, but
maybe not quite. Leo is now one of our great American film actors and
did a great and convincing job in his role, as did the entire film for
extracting great reviews from people who know absolutely nothing about
real science, but sure do love loud and visually exciting and bombastic
stories of extreme pseudo-science. However, my scientific training and
experience would not allow me to join them in that fawning praise even
though I did like Leo and the CGI work a lot. Human reality and truth
are too crucial to me to ever become a fan of such utter nonsense, no
matter how attractively presented it may be. Perhaps that may be my
loss, but so be it.
