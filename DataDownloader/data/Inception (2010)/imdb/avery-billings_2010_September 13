Okay, I would like for the record I do not like Sci-fi; I am a romantic
comedy and drama watcher. So when I was dragged to Inception by my
colleagues, I made it very clear by saying &#x22;If this movie gives me
nightmares it&#x27;s on your heads,&#x22; I was surprised to find that I did not
hate it but actually found it quite intriguing. <br /><br />In the movie Dom Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a master at dream
extraction (or theft of your greatest secrets in your dreams), whom the
United States Government wants, so he can no longer go home to his
children. He is hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a supposedly
impossible mission to make an heir to a business empire split it up so
he does not control 50% of the world&#x27;s energy. His prize for completing
this mission is he will be able to go home to his children again. <br /><br />Along the way he requires help by Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who
researches the target. And Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the architect of the
dreams that makes them so believable that the dreamer believes it the
real world. This is a metaphor for her name from Greek mythology.
Ariadne guides Theseus through the Minotaur&#x27;s Labyrinth as the movie&#x27;s
Ariadne constructs and guides the team through the dreams.<br /><br />One of the things I appreciated was the analogies of the totems to
chance and strategy. Along with the each of the main characters is a
totem to allow them to differentiate the dreams from reality. For Cobb?
A top which will only fall in reality but in a dream it will keep
spinning. Arthur? A pair of loaded dice which he knows which sides will
land up while other will not. While Ariadne crafts a chess piece, which
sadly we never find out how this works to tell her the difference. The
dice and top represent chance as their characters are taking the
chances mainly in the dreams as the last is a strategy piece showing
how Ariadne is constructing the dreams and guiding them through them.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, director/writer Christopher Nolan
(The Dark Knight, Memento) crafts each scene with simplicity and
elegance, but also with confusion and mind- bending twists. The scenes
in the hotel without gravity, especially using the elevator to supply
the kick, is an excellent use of creativity and photography for
exploring the way special effects and cinematography work hand-in-hand
together. <br /><br />Although throughout the movie the quick scene changes do add to the
dramatic effect, they are over used in my opinion to the point where it
becomes too complex to be confused. In the beginning we see this as we
are clearly unable to grasp which scene so far is reality and as the
characters go more in-depth on dreams in dreams we as viewers I feel
begin to lose our perspectives. <br /><br />I also appreciated the usage of special effects within the reams but
also at the end; These special effects were seamless, for as the
dreamer awakes the dream world falls apart, quite literally. Within the
previews we see this as buildings are toppling into the waves, which is
amazing form of reality on how after we awake our dreams collapse and
fall apart. Also the Penrose Stairs early on makes it see how dreams
physics are bended to the mind of the architect, which is another
crucial aspect of this film. <br /><br />For me personally, movies like Inception make you appreciate that even
after a century of moving pictures you can see something original.
Throughout everything this movie has to offer, the combination of the
plot, cast, cinematography, and most importantly being a movie that you
actually need to think about instead of staring at the screen like a
zombie like others, makes it a true piece in the cinematic history.
