Very good movie overall. The action and visuals were great. Leonardo
has really turned into a great portrayer of troubled people who have a
serious mission. <br /><br />I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t have more cool scenes than in the
previews, and it ties into the fact that there are too many rules in
the dream world to really allow much Matrix type bending of reality.
And not just that, but the rules were explained too much and it messed
it up a little for me. I felt they should have left the mystique
there... but for the movie to make sense they ended up having to
over-explain things.<br /><br />Again, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the movie... but if you dislike magical
or mysterious realities being defined too much, just try to make up
your own rules as you watch it.
