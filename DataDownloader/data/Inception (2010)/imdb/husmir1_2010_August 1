Inception for sure has something special in it. it is not just a
regular movie with regular plot delivered directly to the audience. you
have to understand the concepts and relate everything in your mind as
you go deeper and deeper into the movie.<br /><br />It is not only a movie about a dream, It is a dream itself that holds
your attention, challenges your mind, and take you deep enough to start
thinking and relating all the layers you have been through together.<br /><br />and when the journey finishes, it keeps you wondering about it and
hoping that you will have a chance to see it again.<br /><br />the idea was simply genius, and with top-level actors and visuals, it
deserves its place as one of the best movies ever seen.<br /><br />my rating: 10/10
