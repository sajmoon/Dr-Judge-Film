I got an invite to a free prescreening of this movie! I had been seeing
some previews of the movie but I hadn&#x27;t really listened to what the
previews were saying at all. I hadn&#x27;t read anything about what the
movie was about. So I went into it without any kind of expectations
what so ever.<br /><br />I love Science Fiction and this one did not disappoint!! I thought it
was a great movie. If you have a chance to see it on some kind of
digital projection or IMAX do it. An old film reel theater just
wouldn&#x27;t do it justice.<br /><br />It is pretty action packed, lots of twists and turns, gets a little
deep, and leaves you thinking with a little bit of a hanger at the end.
Phenomenal cast! I would pay money to see it again and recommend
everyone to go see it when it opens Friday! Two Thumbs up! -StEpHeN
