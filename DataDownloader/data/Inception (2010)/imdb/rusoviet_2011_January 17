...this is what &#x27;Matrix&#x27; on steroids? I didn&#x27;t finish watching this
overrated pile of nonsense as the &#x27;soap opera&#x27; subplot made what ever
ending was planned impossible to care about.<br /><br />Never ending &#x27;staccato&#x27; of guns shooting in: Tibet, Paris, Los Angeles
(passing for NYC), in cars, out of cars, in buildings - on and on.<br /><br />Worse was the wife of DiCapprio - if one is going to write a story make
it engaging.<br /><br />I have to say the more I &#x27;see&#x27; &#x27;heavies&#x27; assaulting the public through
brawls, shootings, threats - the more it looks like a short career
choice based on declining ability and brains. True actors actresses
understand the ubiquitous chase scenes and shoot em&#x27; ups are filler
because a script can&#x27;t be coherently portrayed. I lost interest after
one hour and pulled the disc before hour two was about to begin.
