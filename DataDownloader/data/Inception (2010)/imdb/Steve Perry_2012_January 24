I just can&#x27;t believe this movie made it to number 13 on the IMDb top
250! I&#x27;ve watched it twice. I didn&#x27;t get the whole concept and the plot
in general. Yes, the special effects are what you would expect from a
movie of this caliber. The acting isn&#x27;t superb. I have never liked
Leonardo Dicaprio, he didn&#x27;t impress me in this movie as well. No
matter how old he is to me he always have that teenage look that
doesn&#x27;t convince me especially in serious movies like this one.<br /><br />The movie takes us in way too many &#x22;dreams&#x22; that at one point you
wonder what&#x27;s the reality, are the characters in a dream, or they are
in present?! For the most part i was forcing my brain to figure out
what&#x27;s going on instead of enjoying the entertaining parts of the film. <br /><br />I would only give this movie 2 stars for the modernistic, high-end
special effects. Definitely doesn&#x27;t deserve a top spot. Not on my list!
