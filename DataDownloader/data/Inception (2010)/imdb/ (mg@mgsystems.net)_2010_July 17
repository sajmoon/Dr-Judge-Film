Many people are saying that Christopher Nolan may be the best film
maker of his generation. I thoroughly enjoyed Memento, thought Batman
Begins was great, thought The Dark Knight was fantastic, and after
watching Inception I think the man is a cinematic genius and can&#x27;t wait
for his next project. But I will have lots of enjoyment watching
Inception many times over until then.<br /><br />He supposedly honed this script for 10 years and it definitely shows.
The story is quite complex and has not a plot hole in it that I was
able to observe. It has everything - loss, redemption, amazing action,
great character development, mind-blowing effects that serve the story
and not the other way around as many films do nowadays, and at the core
is a love story not too unlike Orpheus and Eurydice. But unlike the
myth the underworld is a damaged soul. And when it looks like the story
is wrapped up, there&#x27;s a last second twist that will throw you for a
loop.<br /><br />What the Matrix did for virtual reality - Inception does for dreams and
takes it even deeper. This is a film where spoilers might ruin your
sense of wonder and discovery watching this film for the first time so
I won&#x27;t give you any. But what I will say is that if you took What
Dreams May Come, crossed it with the Matrix, Mission Impossible, and
threw in a good measure of a Phillip K. Dick quality science-fiction
story - you would be heading in the right direction.<br /><br />The hype is real. You will not be disappointed. Go see this film!
