I am not giving this a bad review for any other reason than because it
absolutely sucked.... Would have rather watched the Book of Eli than
this...<br /><br />I went into the movie theater with an open, clear mind, ready to watch
Inception. Well, let me tell you I was let down. The movie did not keep
me interested the least bit. There was too much time for people to
babble on screen and I felt the chemistry between the characters were
lacking. The action scenes were even mediocre... I mean common, how
could the CGI and action be so bad coming from the director of Dark
Knight? I&#x27;ll tell you why, it&#x27;s because he can&#x27;t top his last work and
I am sure he won&#x27;t be able to with any other movie he directs. The
things the movie business will do to get our money... The whole idea of
the dream world was cool but, It could have been taken even farther.
There were so many scenes where I was just saying, &#x22;Well, that doesn&#x27;t
convince me because of this flop, or this mess up the director failed
to notice. Leo did an o.k job in the movie but i swear, it was just
lacking something.... Oh yes, entertainment!!!<br /><br />I suggest going to see Despicable Me or Predators (rather Predators)
because this movie is a flop. Wait until this comes out in your nearest
dollar theaters.<br /><br />On an ending note, I saw this on opening day and half of the people in
the theater were booing at the end a couple walked out during the
movie.
