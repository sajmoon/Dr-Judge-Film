The effects were excellent, but all the best ones were in the trailer.
Without going into spoiler mode I&#x27;ll just say I expected the effects to
have more meaning than they did and I expected them to be used better.
The acting was good, the plot understandable in a single viewing if you
pay attention but it seems like it&#x27;s trying too hard to be
complex/dynamic/intricate. It may make you laugh out loud at how silly
some of the logic is as it twists upon itself and changes but again I
won&#x27;t go into specifics - you&#x27;ll see. Worth a download? Sure, you might
love it as many seem to (over 9 score at this time)...that or someone
figured out how to game the IMDb rating system.
