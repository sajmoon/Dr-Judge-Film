The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this
movie that it was incredible. The storyline made absolutely no sense at
all. It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix (can you say the
Architect). Even more illogical is the fact that if the &#x22;Architect&#x22; can
create stairs, doors, or even an entire dream environment at will, why
can&#x27;t they fly, destroy anything they want any way they want, or make
themselves invisible. At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.<br /><br />The movie just contradicts all of its own rules. People were falling
all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke
up, even though a sense of falling wakes you up. Even worse was the
supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream. I don&#x27;t
even want to get started with that one but a pair of ear-buds just will
not do it. I really think we need to stress science a little more in
our schools.<br /><br />It was pretty cool looking though.
