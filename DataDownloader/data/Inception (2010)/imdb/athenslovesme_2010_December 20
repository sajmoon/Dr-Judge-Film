I was skeptical about watching this film as a lot of people had
mentioned that it was completely convoluted and impossible to follow.<br /><br />I found it was well laid out and above all and maybe its best quality -
it made you think. It developed and unfolded in it&#x27;s own due course.<br /><br />Leo pulls out another fantastic film. The acting was superb by all. I
was most surprised by JGL. From spoof films like 10 Things, to major
action blockbusters, he held his own very well.<br /><br />It certainly had me on the edge of my seat to the very end and I loved
how it keeps you guessing at the end.<br /><br />High marks!
