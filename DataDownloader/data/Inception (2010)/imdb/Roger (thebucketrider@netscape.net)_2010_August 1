2010_August 1 
This film is in the vein of movies like &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; that flirt with
the idea of an unknown but discoverable substrate underlying our
ordinary experiences. This one comes especially close to Poe&#x27;s view
that all that we see is but a dream within a dream. The premise used to
question our grasp on reality is fairly original: a team of individuals
with different specialties has the ability to enter and stage other
people&#x27;s dreams, extract information from their subconscious and,
crucially, even implant ideas with the expectation that these will, so
to speak, rise to the surface--an original method of suggestion. The
film spends quite a bit of time acquainting the viewer with the main
characters and the peculiar laws that govern their work before setting
them on the mission the plot centers on. While it is not always easy to
follow, I found this setup the most arresting part of the film.
Unfortunately, the main narrative does not, in my view, live up to the
promise of the setup. The film is laden with scenes that would fit into
any of a legion of Hollywood action flicks: car chases, hand to hand
combat, explosions, shoot-&#x27;em-ups. It cannot be said that all of these
serve to advance the narrative; the rationale for proceeding from one
hackneyed scene to the next is frequently contrived, illogical or
murky. Technically, they are well done and should gratify those who
thrive on such fare. Visually, I found the scenes that show the
generation of dreamscapes most laudable: the effects truly dazzle. I
won&#x27;t say the film entirely neglects the story it sets in motion but I
certainly feel the time devoted to car chases and explosions could have
been profitably devoted to developing the story and characters. To give
a glaring example, I would have liked to have known the aftermath of
the heros&#x27; intervention in their target&#x27;s subconscious.
