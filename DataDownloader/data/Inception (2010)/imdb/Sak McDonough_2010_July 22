Fresh from watching DiCaprio&#x27;s impressive performance in Shutter Island
the previous night, I had Leo mania and wanted to see more of him on
the silver screen. So the logical thing for me to do was go watch
Inception in theaters and I knew little about the film except it was
directed by Nolan so I Knew I was getting my money&#x27;s worth.<br /><br />What I didn&#x27;t expect was to be in awe for the duration of the film.
Nolan never seems to disappoint and this maybe his best work to date.
Less said about this movie the better, because it must be watched to
realize the genius of this film, and I was glad I wasn&#x27;t caught up in
the hype.<br /><br />Again, DiCaprio&#x27;s presence was memorable and superb. It is such a crime
that his performances are always shy of an Oscar. Same goes for the
supporting cast, Nolan always seems to bring the best out of his stars.
So most of the credit must go to Nolan; the script and the directing is
just near-flawless. Not just any writer/director can pull off the
explosive action and at the same time, captivate the audience with its
thought-provoking ideas. This is one of the best film of the year. It
has everything and will satisfy everyone with its incredible depth,
amazing effects and a masterfully created plot.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s films always leave a very unique impression after watching
them. The Dark knight wowed me but inception left me with a rush of
euphoria, that chill up the spine that tells what you just watched was
artistic genius. I hope to experience more of that rush with his
upcoming films.
