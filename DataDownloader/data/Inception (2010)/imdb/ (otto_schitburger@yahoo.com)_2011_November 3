No actual story. About power and faith. About power as expression of
faith. About limits, fear and selfish. Impressive fragment of US
history, it is, in fact, a parable. With wonderful cast and impressive
images. CGI cityscapes aplenty. DiCaprio as dark side of Father Anatoli
from Ostrov. And the ambition of Pavel Lungin to say never death
truth.Like a diamont, this movie has many faces.<br /><br />So, the first contact is only a sketch. Different impressions, heavey
images, a new Mamonov, a short travel in history book to remind details
about central character. Then, the waters are clear. The lights and the
story , the dark isles and the splendid slices are nuances of same
carpet. Inception is a fragile sinner built in self. And the gill,
protect by Holy Virgin, the jester, the metropolitan, the hysterical
wife - pieces of God presence in a desert and a film without hope.
