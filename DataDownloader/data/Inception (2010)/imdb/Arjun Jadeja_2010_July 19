Inception, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that asks of its
audience to participate in its unraveling. You don&#x27;t just settle into
your seat and &#x27;watch&#x27; this film as an ordinary spectator; you sit there
and carefully work it out, piece by tricky piece. If most films, by
very definition, are made in order to entertain or engage viewers,
Inception does more than that: it challenges them.<br /><br />Not that you should expect any less from the director that gave us the
deliciously complicated Memento and the cerebral blockbuster that was
The Dark Knight. With Inception, Nolan fuses the core agendas of both
those previous films -- he is delivering a spectacle, but to enjoy it
completely the audience must earn it.<br /><br />Indeed Inception requires that you submit your full attention. The film
is part sci-fi, part heist thriller, and part mind-bending
psychological puzzle. And chances are you&#x27;re going to need to watch it
at least a second time to grasp exactly what is going on.<br /><br />Let me lay out the basics: Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, a
master thief-for-hire trained to extract information from a sleeping
person&#x27;s brain. He performs the job skillfully, but lands his toughest
challenge when he&#x27;s hired by a powerful businessman, Saito (played by
Ken Watanabe) to plant an idea in a rival&#x27;s head, instead of stealing
one. The idea when planted, will cause Saito&#x27;s business rival Robert
Fischer (played by Cillian Murphy) to break up his father&#x27;s
multimillion-dollar empire.<br /><br />Dom sets out to accomplish the job with a faithful team that comprises
his longtime right-hand man (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a
&#x27;forger&#x27; who can morph into another person&#x27;s identity (played by Tom
Hardy), a scientist who supplies the sedative needed to put the victims
and the extractors into a slumber (played by Dileep Rao), and an
architect who designs mazes for the dream world (played by Ellen Page).
It doesn&#x27;t help however, that Dom is haunted by the memory of his dead
wife Mal (played by Marion Cotillard), who has the irritating habit of
showing up in his subconscious and messing with his mind while he&#x27;s at
work.<br /><br />Much of the film&#x27;s first hour is spent illustrating how Dom&#x27;s job
works: how he extracts dreams and ideas from people&#x27;s heads, and what
exactly the process involves. You&#x27;re introduced to the concept of
multiple levels and layers within the subconscious (meaning dreams
within dreams within dreams), and you&#x27;re familiarized with the rules by
which this virtual-reality world works -- such as what happens if you
die in a dream, the nature of dream time v/s real time, and the dangers
of layering elaborate dreams within dreams.<br /><br />As a viewer it takes time to arrive on the same page as the characters,
and just when you think you&#x27;ve figured it out, you find yourself
flummoxed again by all the drama and action unfolding within parallel
dream states.<br /><br />Visually, Inception is a jaw-dropping marvel if you consider the manner
in which Nolan blurs the real with the surreal, without ever going all
Alice in Wonderland on us. Watch the scene in which the city of Paris
folds in on itself like a book, or the one in which Gordon-Levitt gets
into a gravity-defying duel with a bunch of bad guys in a hotel
corridor. Using minimal CGI to execute the audacious stunts, Nolan
keeps the dreams grounded in plausibility.<br /><br />There is no shortage of high-adrenalin action either, which is
delivered in that breathless foot-chase sequence through the streets of
Tangiers, a scene that seems as if it&#x27;s been pulled straight out of a
Jason Bourne movie.<br /><br />The ensemble cast dives into the film&#x27;s challenging narrative and
delivers credible performances across the board, although special
mention has to be made of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who creates a composed,
confident character that is a clever foil to DiCaprio&#x27;s Dom Cobb.<br /><br />As the leader of the pack, the protagonist of this drama, Leonardo
DiCaprio is first-rate. He brings genuine emotion to the scenes in
which we see Cobb overwhelmed with love for his wife and children, and
he is every bit as convincing in his action star avatar. For DiCaprio
Inception stands as a companion piece to Shutter Island in which he
also played a widower at the mercy of dark illusions.<br /><br />Ultimately the film works because it keeps you on your toes throughout.
There is excitement to be had in the struggle to keep up with what&#x27;s
going on, and in the end if you feel like there&#x27;s a lot that went over
your head, well, join the club! If you thought Memento was confusing,
wait till you sink your teeth into Inception. I&#x27;m going with 10 out of
10 for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception. It&#x27;s the most original film I&#x27;ve
seen in long time. A masterstroke of writing and storytelling. At
roughly two hours and thirty minutes it leaves you exhausted, but in a
good way.
