This is not just a story telling, this is INCEPTION. Some may find it
hard to digest but the fact is, this movie is all about planting an
idea in the minds of viewers. This is exceptionally smart film-making.
Some may argue about the vague ending and in fact Nolan deliberately
left some puzzles unsolved and confusing but this film is lot more than
that. I did not find this movie confusing and the ending is absolutely
up to the mark. It is a complete film with absolute complete ending and
a very beautiful message has been planted at the end, in a mysterious
way which is the best part of the movie. Nolan is the one to watch and
he is the most entertaining and improvising director of our age who is
giving the film making a new dimension. Bravo.<br /><br />10/10
