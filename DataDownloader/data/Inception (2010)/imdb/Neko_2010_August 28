I loved this film. As someone who has vivid dreams, I related to the
descriptions of dream sequences. I also thought the pace was perfect. I
initially expected it to be a faster pace, given Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
recent films, however, the languid pace of this film suited the dream
scape context. The acting was superb. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as
the tortured protagonist and Marion Cotillard is stunning. What I
enjoyed most is that this film is a unique offering, unlike other films
in recent history and it takes you on a journey as a result as you
don&#x27;t know where you will end up. I would definitely recommend taking
the time to go to the cinema to see this one as you will be entertained
and you will be taken far away to someone else&#x27;s dreams for a few
hours. You need to suspend reality and be prepared to go on a journey
into Christopher Nolan&#x27;s mind. Just go with it and see where you end
up.
