2010_July 22 
Let me start off this review by making a very bold statement: Inception
is the greatest film of the 21st century.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t believe me? That&#x27;s alright I understand. It IS a very bold
statement and it sounds like an exaggeration. But you see I&#x27;m not the
kind of person who walks out of every new blockbuster saying &#x22;oh well
that&#x27;s the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.&#x22; For years now I have
consistently felt that Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &#x22;The Departed&#x22; is the greatest
film of the 21st century. (Which is ironic in the fact that they both
star Leonardo DiCaprio) This is the first film that has come out in the
last ten years that I can definitively say is better than &#x22;The
Departed&#x22;. So let me tell you that I sit in front of my computer right
now firmly knowing (Notice I said knowing. Not believing) that writer/
director Christopher Nolan is the greatest film maker of his
generation.<br /><br />You may remember some of Nolan&#x27;s previous works such as Memento, The
Prestige, and the last two Batman films. Of Nolan&#x27;s previous works,
Memento is probably my favorite. Memento is a tale of revenge seen
through the eyes of a man with literal short term memory loss, he can
remember things for only a few minutes then he forgets them, so he
leaves him self notes and even has tattoos of information carved on his
body so he can track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. Now
on July 15th I would have told you that memento was the most complex
and brilliantly written movie that&#x27;s out there. (However I&#x27;m not saying
that Memento is better than The Departed, because it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just
better written) Then on July 16th Inception came along and changed
everything. Oh my god it&#x27;s so good it&#x27;s ridiculous! Before I gush about
how how amazing this movie is and talk about why it&#x27;s a masterpiece,
first let me give you a run down of the plot.<br /><br />In the very near future, technology exists to enter the human mind when
it&#x27;s at it&#x27;s most vulnerable, when it&#x27;s dreaming. Dom Cobb (DiCaprio)
is the worlds most skilled extractor. This means he enters a person&#x27;s
subconscious, finds their deepest secrets, and steals them. He&#x27;s
usually working for an employer looking to steal a rivaling company&#x27;s
secrets from it&#x27;s president or CEO. Simple enough right? Wrong. Cobb
has some demons that give him a very unstable subconscious and
sometimes his memories interfere with the dream he&#x27;s in, making it
almost impossible to do his job adequately. (cue the complexity) Cobb
has had a troubled past. Now I don&#x27;t want to give too much away so I&#x27;ll
just say this, Cobb is unable to unite with his children in America
because he&#x27;s been falsely made a fugitive. Then Cobb is approached by
Saito, a very very powerful businessman who wants Cobb to perform
inception, the opposite of extraction. Instead of stealing an idea, you
plant one. In exchange for doing this Saito tells Cobb he can clear him
of his charges and allow him to return to his children. Cobb agrees. <br /><br />Now the plot is much more intricate, dense, and multi-layered than the
rundown I just gave you. I&#x27;m telling you this movie is a thinker. It&#x27;s
a movie for smart people. If your trying to decide whether or not this
is the movie for you let me help: if you enjoy the films of Michael
Bay, this isn&#x27;t the movie for you. But if you have thoughts and are
compelled by top notch story telling then this film will unmercifully
hold you to the edge of your seat from the cryptic and vague opening
until then brilliant controversial ending.<br /><br />On top of the ridiculously complex and ingenious plot, there is also a
plethora of great performances. I&#x27;m telling you every one is good here.
Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, there all top notch. I&#x27;ve seen a couple of
critics say that this is DiCaprio&#x27;s finest performance of his career.
However I wouldn&#x27;t quite go that far. While this is absolutely
absolutely the best overall film he&#x27;s been in, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s his
best performance. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s an amazing performance but
if I had to say what his best was, I think it would still be from one
of his many works with Scorsese.<br /><br />This film tops some of the strongest films of the decade. So you can
get an idea of how amazing this film is, let me name off some films
from the last ten years that Inception is better than:<br /><br />The Departed Gladiator No Country for Old Men There Will Be Blood
Memento The Dark Knight Inglourious Basterds District 9 All Lord of the
Rings pictures The Aviator Avatar The Hurt Locker Slum-dog Millionaire<br /><br />I think I&#x27;ve made my point. Go see this movie at all costs. See it then
see it a second time. Then do what I have done: Stay up at night
contemplating and ironing out in your head the tiniest details from the
foundation of the super structure that is the plot of this bloody
masterpiece that Christopher Nolan in all his ingenious glory
constructed out of his unprecedented talent. This isn&#x27;t just a movie.
From everything from the screen writing, to the directing, to the
acting, to the music, to the editing, to the cinematography, this is a
work of art. Perfect score from me. SEE IT NOW. And see it again
tomorrow.
