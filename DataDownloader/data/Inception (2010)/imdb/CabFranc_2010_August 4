You know, I read these user reviews and see that most of the mediocre
to negative reviews focus on the general idea that there are dumb
people, dump people who think they are smart and smart people.
Invariably, the people writing these reviews categorize themselves as
the third option while &#x27;blaming&#x27; the 2nd option for the great reviews.
I&#x27;d like to add a fourth option: smart people who think they are
smarter than they really are.<br /><br />OK, so I&#x27;m as bad as they are commenting on them, but in principle they
are giving tepid reviews because the movie is popular. They should
stick to what&#x27;s in the movie instead of trying to denigrate others and
puff themselves up.<br /><br />The great appeal of Inception is that it&#x27;s a heist movie with an
original plot line. This is the hook that brings in the broad appeal,
and that alone makes it worth seeing. Don&#x27;t go see it if you want a
character driven movie. This is all about an unconscious world Nolan
has conceived and a plot that takes place in it. It&#x27;s visually stunning
and there are several intricate fight scenes that should impress for
their technical acuity.<br /><br />I do think this is a movie that lends itself to reading on multiple
levels. Watch it with an open mind. Yeah, there&#x27;s some clunky
exposition and one dimensional characters. But in sum it&#x27;s a rather
stunning accomplishment to make a summer blockbuster with enough depth
to warrant a repeat viewing and further discussion afterward. This is
one of those movies that has grown on me after watching it. It only
prompts questions about itself, so perhaps isn&#x27;t profound in that
regard, but certainly falls in the upper several percentiles in terms
of engaging the viewer.
