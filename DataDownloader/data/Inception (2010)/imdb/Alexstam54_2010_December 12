I just can&#x27;t believe that this movie gets a 9!!! It&#x27;s pretentious,
boring and &#x27;much ado about nothing&#x27;. I thought it would be a movie as
good as &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; (the first one!), but that movie is so much
better. If you like movies with a twist, try &#x27;Blade runner&#x27;, &#x27;Moon&#x27;,
&#x27;Minority report&#x27; or even &#x27;Triangle&#x27;, but skip this one. What a waste
of time and talent. With that money you could make 20 or so great,
personal movies. Or feed a small African country... Watching this
failure really made me angry. It&#x27;s an empty shell. O.k., there are some
pluses: the actors do their best and some scenes look great, especially
the crumbling cliffs and the &#x27;ceiling&#x27; of buildings, but that&#x27;s just
not enough for a movie that lasts for 2 1/2 hours...
