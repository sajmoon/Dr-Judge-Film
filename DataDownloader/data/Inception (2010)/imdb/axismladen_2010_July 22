I really had high hopes for this one. As a writer, i can say that it
wasn&#x27;t an easy job to write this. One, because it&#x27;s hard to keep the
structure straight and two, because the story is quite original and
innovative so it takes a lot of talent and imagination to turn it into
a script. A good one at least. I was really afraid that this will turn
out to be an action movie... as it did. Though, i must say that i
wasn&#x27;t disappointed one bit. Even with all the mindless action
sequences and all the twists that were going on through the film, it
managed to stay intelligent and surprising. All the credit to the
writer for it. Once again, it wasn&#x27;t an easy job.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Usually in Nolan&#x27;s movies i really don&#x27;t see a lot from actors. With
this one i was blown away. I hope and think that DiCaprio, Ellen Page
and Marion Cotillard should all, at least, be nominated for the Academy
Award. As should Christopher Nolan for The Best Script and maybe, i&#x27;m
not so sure, for The Best Director. Also, i have to mention Joseph
Gordon-Levitt who was also great in his role but still, the role it
self didn&#x27;t ask too much so i doubt he&#x27;ll get any credit for it. The
same for Tom Hardy.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Even i think the movie is very intelligent and ultimately brilliant, i
still think that it would work even better as more of a drama than
action. I think it would be taken a lot more seriously by voters and
that in that case it would be able to show it&#x27;s true potential.<br /><br />------------------------------- <br /><br />However, that doesn&#x27;t stay in my way to call Inception a masterpiece in
it&#x27;s genre. I hope the action movies will go this direction from now on
and be more intelligent.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Inception is a great movie that you will be thinking about days after
you see it. I&#x27;ve seen it only once but i&#x27;m planning to see it again.
Three or four times, at least. I really think it has to be seen a
couple of times to see it&#x27;s mistakes and possible holes. Like this it&#x27;s
impossible to spot any because the script is so well crafted with a
whole bunch of thing&#x27;s thrown in it that could possibly be there to
distract you from the very things i mentioned. All in all, it&#x27;s a great
movie that you will definitely enjoy watching more than once!!!! As i
said, a masterpiece in it&#x27;s genre and the best action movie in the
history!
