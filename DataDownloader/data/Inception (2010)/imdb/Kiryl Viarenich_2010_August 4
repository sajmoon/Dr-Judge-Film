It was an impressive film, but I think that you&#x27;ll find it too
complicated. It reminds The Thirteenth Floor (1999) by using technology
for changing our feelings: such a multi-user virtual reality. DiCaprio&#x27;
acting skills reached the top and up today he has worked with most top
film directors. His character is quite real... even when asleep! Are
special effects worth mentioning? They always remind me of those in
Matrix (1999), but are they necessary to make sure we are dreaming?
Isn&#x27;t it enough to check one&#x27;s totem? This movie is about artistic
imagination, isn&#x27;t it? Anything can happen in your dream. Maybe the
idea of this film appeared while Christopher Nolan was dreaming? Anyway
the movie is a hit, it is worth seeing. This one is a probable nominee
for academy award as the best film.
