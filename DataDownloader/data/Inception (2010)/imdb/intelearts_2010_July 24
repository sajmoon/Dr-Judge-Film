2010_July 24 
Not one person moved in the largest cinema in the Nordic region last
night. The premiere started at 10 pm and we we left at 12.30 completely
immersed, satisfied, and astonished that a film could be so
non-condescending to its audience and still be a summer blockbuster.<br /><br />This is real brain food coupled with summer blockbuster action that
makes for an immensely satisfying experience - words spring up -
labyrinthine, complex, high octane action - above all, Nolan gives us a
real sense of cinema. Rather than some high end ideas and lots of CGI
chucked together, we get instead a thorough exploration of some harder
epistemological questions about what is reality coupled with stunning
effects (that were made using mechanical sets mixed with CGI). On many
levels this is one of the more satisfying films of the past decade.<br /><br />The plot of a man who can enter people&#x27;s subconscious, who, after
losing his wife, is not allowed Stateside to see his children, is then
offered the chance to see them again, if he helps a Japanese
industrialist. He must be insert an idea into deep subconscious of the
heir of a rival industrialist. This is played out through layer upon
layer of dreams. The plot is convoluted -but not contrived - and
concentration pays off : effort = reward.<br /><br />We liked that fantasy is kept to a minimum - and that the dreams have
more weight as they are based in reality.<br /><br />All in all, the film looks gorgeous (And we saw it on the largest
screen in Scandinavia in Malm&#xF6;, Sweden), it requires that you
concentrate, does not condescend, is fresh, smart, exciting, dark,
complex, and fun - and above all, we deserve films this smart. Can i
say that again? We want films this smart - really.<br /><br />Not one person in the two and a half hours in the packed house of 600
went for a toilet break- and if that ain&#x27;t recommendation enough I
don&#x27;t know what is....a great movie.
