This film should have been awarded a Razzie for having the worst plot,
that is if such an award exists. The plot was immensely difficult to
follow. I remember reading one of a free cinema magazines while
watching it at the cinema. The plot is in a dream, that is in another
dream that is in a dream while he is dreaming, or something along those
lines. For the first half an hour or so I was engaged with the film&#x27;s
plot. Who wouldn&#x27;t be interested in the idea that Nolan was playing
with? But he took his ideas too far in the case of &#x27;Inception.&#x27; The
whole thing just became ridiculous. <br /><br />The bizarre plot had an effect on the other aspects of the film. The
otherwise brilliant action scenes became surprisingly dull. As I often
had little idea of what was going on, to me the action scenes just
seemed pointless as I did not know what the characters motives
were.Despite this, the action scenes and the cinematography did offer a
real spectacle.<br /><br />Again, one of the positives was that the acting was, admittedly of a
good quality. DiCaprio, Page, Caine and Postlewaite all had good
performances. But is was such a shame that I was not able to follow the
development of the characters because of the plot.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy a mind-boggling plot then &#x27;Inception&#x27; will be for
you. If you want a film that you will enjoy from start to finish
without having to get into it, &#x27;Inception&#x27; will not be for you.
