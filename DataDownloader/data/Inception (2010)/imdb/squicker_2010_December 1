Inception is a fine film, but it cannot match up to the hype. I am not
going to explain much of the film here because it will ruin a plot
built on surprises. Leo Caprio plays &#x27;Cobb&#x27;, a man possessed of a
desire to return to the US to see his children, but is currently barred
from the USA. God knows why he can&#x27;t just move his kids to live with
him in an altogether nicer country, but seemingly he can&#x27;t. His
passport to his dream is to enter the dreams of others and steal ideas,
using some unexplained technology. Think Existenz, and you&#x27;ll be on the
right track, however Existenz did this a lot better IMO. <br /><br />Now, the cast is very good and Nolan conjures strong performances from
every one of them. The cinematography is world class and where effects
are used, they are striking and superb. But there&#x27;s little emotional
engagement with the characters, even the always brilliant DiCaprio
fails to make us care for him. Add to this a flaky set of rules about
the universe they inhabit, and it starts to get a little shaky. One
gets the distinct feeling that Nolan changes and bends his own film
architecture to suit the plot, rather than allowing the plot to
flourish inside the film. He falls short of writing himself into a
corner but nonetheless, this constant bending of the rules of the film
prevents us from achieving total suspension of disbelief. On more than
one occasion I was sat there thinking, &#x22;that&#x27;s all well and good but
this latest statement contradicts earlier statements about such and
such..&#x22;<br /><br />I can&#x27;t give anything away on the above, but you&#x27;ll see it for
yourself, I am sure of that. <br /><br />I&#x27;d like to watch the film again to clarify a few points but some
rather rambling exposition early in the film puts me off a little. I am
sure that&#x27;ll change and this is certainly a film that&#x27;ll reward repeat
viewings. <br /><br />I thought that Shutter Island was a far more delicate and engaging
treatment of similar subject matter, with a superb and decisive
denouement, whereas Inception rests on a fair few clich&#xE9;s. <br /><br />Definitely superior to your typical Hollywood blockbuster but not the
work of genius the Internet would have you believe it is.
