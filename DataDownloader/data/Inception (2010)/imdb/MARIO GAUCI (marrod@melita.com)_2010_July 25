2010_July 25 
Seeing how Luis Bunuel (the master in the depiction of cinematic
reveries) is my all-time favorite auteur, it goes without saying that I
am fascinated by dream sequences in movies and the notion that
INCEPTION was going to be an elaborate exploration of the dream-state
in arty sci-fi/caper thriller terms was a potentially invigorating one.
I must say that director Nolan assembled quite a remarkable cast here
(even though it does feel sometimes like their names were ticked
triumphantly off of a list of actors he has been wanting to work with):
Leonardo Di Caprio, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe
(being the established &#x22;heavyweights&#x22;); Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt
and Dileep Rao (the up-and-coming &#x22;new breed&#x22;); Tom Berenger, Lukas
Haas and Pete Poslethwaite (the &#x22;comeback&#x22; crowd); plus Michael Caine
and Cillian Murphy (from Nolan&#x27;s own &#x22;stock company&#x22;). All the actors
rise deftly to the occasion but I would single out Cotillard (as Di
Caprio&#x27;s enigmatic dead wife who haunts him constantly), Gordon-Levitt
and Hardy (as members of Di Caprio&#x27;s elite theme of dream-stealers) for
particular praise. Two equally impressive contributions to the film&#x27;s
overall success are Hans Zimmer&#x27;s powerful score and some truly
dazzling special visual effects (especially during the amazing &#x27;folding
city&#x27; sequence). Besides, for a typically (by today&#x27;s standards)
protracted 148-minute movie, it was a surprisingly fast ride.<br /><br />Now, as is perhaps my custom for contemporary fare, comes the barrage
of reservations I had with the film which, in some people&#x27;s minds,
might disqualify the *** (i.e. good) rating above!: above all, I had a
problem with the film&#x27;s relentless desire to &#x22;have the cake and eat it
too&#x22; by turning out what is, essentially, the cerebral version of the
action-packed Summer blockbuster. The members of Di Caprio&#x27;s team are
supposed to be technological geeks but the extraordinary life-saving
feats they accomplish in the movie (albeit only ever taking place in
their subconscious) would make James Bond dive for his hat and pension
cheque!; the latter&#x27;s iconic presence is particularly recalled in the
final snow-bound dream sequence that literally plays out like the 21st
century version of ON HER MAJESTY&#x27;S SECRET SERVICE (1969). I also found
the gravity-defying flying antics of the hotel room set-piece hard to
take and not a little silly (especially when Gordon-Levitt has to carry
out his dormant companions on top of one another!) &#x96; and this is coming
from somebody who has so far resisted the urge to watch (sacrilege of
sacrileges) THE MATRIX trilogy. Again, I understand that most of what
we see is supposed to be taking place in the dream-state but it felt
pretty ridiculous to me to have six people all asleep at one time all
the time&#x85;even though every manner of bullet and bomb is exploding all
around them! Amusingly, that enormously extended slow-motion shot of
the van tumbling into the sea reminded me of Howard Hawks&#x27; (unjust in
his case) denigrating comment on one of my all-time favorite Westerns
i.e. Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s THE WILD BUNCH (1969)!<br /><br />On one hand, I am in awe of Christopher Nolan for having undertaken
such a dauntingly complex task &#x96; creating a multi-layered maze of
dreams within dreams &#x96; all by himself (even if it took him a good eight
years to do so); on the other hand, however, I do not accept the fact
that this should excuse several illogicalities that bugged me as I was
watching it, namely: why would Di Caprio accept a newbie (albeit one as
graceful as Page and who had been recommended to him by his
father-in-law Caine) as part of the team for one final fling at his
ultra-specialized job with an all-important outcome (reuniting him with
his long-lost children)?; similarly, how on earth could a mere
industrialist (Watanabe) nullify Di Caprio&#x27;s murder charges by making
one phone call?; what was the point of the team risking their lives
repeatedly to discover the contents of Poslethwaite&#x27;s vault when it has
been telegraphed in advance (in that recurring photograph of Murphy as
a boy) all along? &#x96; irresistible shades of CITIZEN KANE (1941)&#x27;s
&#x22;Rosebud&#x22; climactic revelation perchance?; I am sure there was a
rock-solid reason for Nolan and Zimmer to go for Edith Piaf&#x27;s &#x22;Non, Je
Ne Regrette Rien&#x22; anthem as the team&#x27;s &#x27;wake-up&#x27; tune&#x85;but the Cotillard
connection made it seem far too deliberate. The one cardinal sin that
the film commits, in my humble opinion, is that none of the dreams
seemed the least bit dream-like to me! They are far too realistically
realized and cleverly choreographed to ever attain the jumbled-up and
repetitive nature of a true dream {sic}. Although one could easily tell
whose dream we were in at any given point in time (since that character
is virtually the protagonist in his own vision), I have to admit to
losing sight of the stakes in some of them and, what is worse, I did
not really care! Equally unimportant, it seems to me, was whether the
totem would stop spinning, fall off the table or whatever in that
&#x27;not-all-that-unexpected&#x27; open ending!!
