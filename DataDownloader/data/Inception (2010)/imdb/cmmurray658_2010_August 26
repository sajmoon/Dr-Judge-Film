This movie is absolutely genius!! To come up with the thought process
of this movie is mind-boggling. My mind was on full alert during the
entire movie processing everything that was going on. I can never dream
the same way again. And every actor/actress was brilliant!! I fell more
in love with every single one of them. Leonardo, Joseph, Ellen, ..all
of them! And I must say that Leonardo and Joseph were GORGEOUS!! What
sexy men, especially when they were dressed up in suits. I fell in love
with Joseph Levitt. I loved him after he did 10 Things I Hate About You
with Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger (rest his soul), but now it&#x27;s a full
obsession. Thumbs up to everyone involved with this project. It was a
great success.!
