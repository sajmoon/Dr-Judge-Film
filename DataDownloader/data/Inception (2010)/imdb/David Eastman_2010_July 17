So time for more expensively filmed science fiction entertainment. At
least this is not a comic adaption. Should this have been a TV series?
Nolan tries his best to keep it within the bounds of cinema and mainly
pulls it off.<br /><br />As the actors are pushed around the set and through the rushed plot,
the layer below the slightly antiseptic action scenes becomes apparent.
The high hokum is in the employ of fairly intelligent questions.<br /><br />One of the problems that has to be faced by films using virtual
scenarios is to set the right level of jeopardy. This is done on the
hoof in Inception, with rules of the game announced as we go. Yet the
director rarely abuses this.<br /><br />The classic problem with the Matrix era films was unexplained pop video
place changes largely to show off budget - but everyone still behaved
as if they were in LA. To some degree Inception nods at this with its
own high sheen low fidelity changes, but is also gently ribbing them.
Its all a dream, of course.<br /><br />There is no question that by the last scene you feel that another
concept has escaped the original film - I think this is what people are
referring to as cerebral. It is a badge of faith that the film is
improved on repeat viewing (i.e. it is too dense for one telling) and
that leaves the film as a work that will live as much on the internet
forums as in your head.
