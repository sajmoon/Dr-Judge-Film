I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but looking at the &#x27;This is a true
masterpiece&#x27; type of reviews I thought I would balance it out a bit.<br /><br />Inception is a good film, the special effects are simply stunning and
the acting very good indeed.<br /><br />The plot however is quite weak, and gets a bit lost and muddled towards
the end.<br /><br />Many people think that because the plot appears complicated you have to
watch it very carefully or twice. Not true the plot is very simple, and
I found the film easy to follow, in fact after the first 30 Min&#x27;s, me
and my mates could easily predict what would happen - and indeed it did
happen.<br /><br />All in all a good film, its the best I have seen this year. However
very predictable and not really that clever.
