I loved some of Nolan&#x27;s other films. I really loved Memento, Insomnia,
The Prestige. I liked The Dark Knight.<br /><br />During Inception I kept checking my watch. I was trying to decide
whether I checked my watch (as in, &#x22;are we there yet?&#x22;) more times
during a recent, torturous, 9-hour transatlantic flight or during this
2 hour 20 minute movie.<br /><br />I think as a 90 minute movie this would have been fun and entertaining.
Nothing too special but it would have been a fine entertaining movie. I
don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />It&#x27;s like a high-priced CGI-laden attempt at a Philip K Dick novel but
a little overwrought.
