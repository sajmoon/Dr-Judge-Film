this is Nolan&#x27;s best film .Great script followed by good climax.I like
things out of the box and let me tell you this is brilliantly out of
the box.the first half is the set up to the film but the second half is
like a page turner .It sets your pulses high.The crew is quite same as
from the batman series but i don&#x27;t see the reason why Bale couldn&#x27;t
have played the lead.Probably Di Caprio has done something beyond his
chocolate boy image. film-9.6 direction-10 cinematography-8 Actually
this film is quite better than the batman series of his.Memento
.....well i think it is better than Memento.Finally a film which you
just don&#x27;t wrap up in a pop corn and leave it in the cinema hall.
