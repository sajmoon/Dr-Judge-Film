Like many, I enjoy Chris Nolan&#x27;s work. I find that it is refreshing,
innovative, and remarkably original. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is no different.
Having very high expectations, I did not expect the film to surpass
them, especially after reading some reviews (like A.O. Scott&#x27;s).
Needless to say, it was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />The sheer premise of the story is exciting, being able to enter
people&#x27;s dreams through technology. This automatically opens the gate
to infinite possibilities and adventures to the far reaches of the
mind, and it may give a headache. From there, the story excels, gets
the viewer familiar with &#x22;extraction&#x22; and &#x22;inception&#x22;, then sends them
on an action-packed, suspense-driven, and wildly entertaining cinematic
experience that one likely won&#x27;t forget anytime soon. I certainly
won&#x27;t.<br /><br />The casting is great, all being given solid stuff to work with. The
plot is more than substantial. The music is riveting, provided by Hans
Zimmer, a recent collaborator with Nolan. Visually it is also a feast,
but above all, it gets the viewer thinking. &#x22;Inception&#x22; makes the
viewer use the very mechanism that the film explores, the brain. It is
a very smart movie, something that we are rarely given nowadays, only
dumb shoot-em-ups. Those films make this look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />I need to see it again. I highly recommend.
