First of all CN is without doubt the best director of our time because
he is unmatched by any director in his style,atmosphere , tone and
ending , he directs because that what he want , he don&#x27;t want some
Blockbuster that everybody will forget after they leave the cinema , he
wants to put his signature and to be remembered for his art.<br /><br />Inception is a movie that only smart people will know what is going on
, from the beginning to the end the whole movie for some reason felt
like one big scene maybe because there was no holes in the plot,
perfect logic and mastermind director ,148 min was like dream , really
Nolan manged to make a movie that will make you live in dream-like
feeling (for me at least) . the acting , soundtrack , locations ,
atmosphere and the special effects are all PERFECT. <br /><br />A masterpiece work of art , this is what you got when the writer direct
the movie , and for those who feel a little bit lost it is like The
Matrix but in the eyes of Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />if something happened to C.Nolan say goodbye Hollywood .
