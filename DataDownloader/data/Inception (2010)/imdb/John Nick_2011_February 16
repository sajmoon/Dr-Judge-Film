It&#x27;s an original idea to introduce the alternate world of someone&#x27;s
mind as the place of the action, and by this i mean doing voluntary,
deterministic, cause and effect actions that do affect the reality of
the character involved. <br /><br />I&#x27;m not a great movie fan, i don&#x27;t really make a goal for myself in
following some trend or idea in the movie world, let&#x27;s just say I feel
sometimes the TV set has too much control on the movies I watch, :),
and coming from this I dare to say that the theme is not quite present
in the past years, and this is a good thing to start with for a success
movie. But besides being an original idea, i think it&#x27;s followers
failed to make the most out of it. <br /><br />My point is that if you try to extract from the movie the specific of
this new world they discovered for us you can see it&#x27;s not too much.
You can bend the cityscape, you can make the things explode, there are
new specializations for the people involved (some create and some just
act), and somehow you can keep some dead people consciousness trapped
inside this world, and there&#x27;s a door to some dark other world where
these dead people go. And this is all about this mind world. <br /><br />The bad thing is that this is not enough. It&#x27;s not enough developed for
us and it was not enough for this movie authors. Apart from this comes
a load of pop-corn movie elements which you can see in every typical
action movie: they run a lot, they shot each other a lot, and that&#x27;s
about all. So the specific of the mind world is left apart, and the
action movie takes too much. <br /><br />In this sense I say it&#x27;s a lost opportunity. <br /><br />Too bad for them - the movie industry - that they spoiled us with such
great movies as &#x22;Solaris&#x22;, &#x22;Dark City&#x22;, &#x22;Sin City&#x22;, &#x22;Immortel&#x22; and a
lot more - some of my favourite movies ever - and learned us what to
expect from such alternate reality worlds and ideas. This movies have
fully developed worlds in which the original element or idea is led to
take entirely over the world and action and it&#x27;s doing it so good ! The
action of such movies can&#x27;t be the same outside these movies and in
this sense we can say these movies ideas are fully grown and developed.
And this is the major shortcoming of &#x22;Inception&#x22;, it can be more, it&#x27;s
a lost opportunity to do a really great movie with a novel idea.
