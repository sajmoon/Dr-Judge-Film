Right from the start of this film you know that this is directed by
Christopher Nolan. His trademark camera angles and high-rise shots of
cities is reminiscent of the Dark Knight and the fantastic background
score, which is simple yet creepy, sets up the mood for this very
strange yet very amazing film.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Dominic Cobb, a thief who has the ability via technology
and a few skilled friends to invade the dreams of people for many
different reasons. I won&#x27;t reveal anymore except that Dom is seeking
redemption and is desperately trying to clear his name. This characters
back story is the important part of the entire plot that reminds me a
lot of DiCaprio&#x27;s sub-plot in Shutter Island, but be warned, this film
is not a dud one as that unfortunate waste of 2-hours was.<br /><br />Visually this film is a casket of wonders that you just cannot stop
staring at in amazement. The special effects are extremely breathtaking
as well and though the film at times has a matrix feel, even with the
basis of the plot, it could not be more different.<br /><br />Once the film is over and you&#x27;ve understood what it is all about, which
honestly, is not hard to understand, you do sit back and think &#x22;how did
the Nolan brothers come up with this idea?&#x22;<br /><br />It is a complex script and easily one that the faint hearted or should
I say faint-brained may not get, but it is a wonderful script with
excellent dialogue, a fully justified plot and some very deep moments
of superb acting, camera work and emotion.<br /><br />Each and every actor, a few that have worked with the Nolan brothers
before are absolutely perfect and their characters are also a delight
to watch on screen. The biggest surprise for me was Joseph
Gordon-Levitt (the youngster from 10 Things I Hate About You and
Halloween H20 and more recently seen in G. I. Joe) who is given a large
portion of screen time and provides the movies only laugh out loud
moments. Cillian Murphy, who I haven&#x27;t seen much of is also fantastic
and displays his emotions with finesse. <br /><br />The dream within a dream aspect is also very smartly portrayed on
screen and a lot of thought has gone into how much time and impact each
level of the dreams will and does have on the characters as they go
through the realms to complete one very difficult task.<br /><br />With any film, there are bound to be flaws or drawbacks as such, and as
I&#x27;m being extremely picky, I have to admit that though the concept of
the film is extremely original and wonderful, the driving force, which
is DiCaprio&#x27;s character&#x27;s personal journey, is only good because of
Ellen Page&#x27;s involvement and Marion Cotillard&#x27;s wonderful turn as Dom&#x27;s
wife.<br /><br />Despite the numerous effects and action sequences, there are large
parts where the story goes into a lot of depth as it explains what the
characters are planning as their final big job. Some people will find
this monotonous and confusing but personally it was a job well done.
Enticing music, quick cuts and lots of dialogue kept me glued as I did
not want to miss a thing and what the film lacks in large chunks
without action it makes up for with solid performances (which I keep
mentioning) and a solid overall story. <br /><br />As the film goes on and we finally come to the conclusion, which ends
on a very cheeky note, you can&#x27;t help but be amazed at what you have
just witnessed. It&#x27;s honestly a very clever and well thought out film
but, and here it comes, there is just something not quite there for me
to give this film full marks. And as I pondered over this for almost 24
hours, I could not understand what it was. <br /><br />BEST SCENE: The entire finale; I honestly couldn&#x27;t predict if they were
going to succeed in their mission or be betrayed or fail or a number of
things. Shiver.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Christopher Nolan has certainly raised the bar, just as
the Matrix did with Bullet-time, and he&#x27;s created an absolutely
thrilling film with excellent effects, acting and an awesome script,
yet, this just isn&#x27;t as perfect as it should be. This is so far the
best film of the year, but not quite Nolan&#x27;s best. <br /><br />9/10 &#x96; Almost Perfect
