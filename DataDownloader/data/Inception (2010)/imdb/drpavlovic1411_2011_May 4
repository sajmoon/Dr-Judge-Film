I gave 9 of 10 stars, just to have one star spare for some movie which
will be a movie of my life, there is no other reason. Otherwise, this
movie deserves 10 of 10.<br /><br />I will skip the story, you can read it from the synopsis and the other
reviews and talk what I think that is great in it.<br /><br />I must say, Matrix is nothing in comparison to this movie. The special
effects, the main idea (to steal the information from the mind of
people who are pushed into a dream of the other dreamer, who is a part
of the team of &#x27;extractors of the secrets&#x27;) and playing with the idea
about the dream inside of a dream inside of a dream. <br /><br />Again, DiCaprio was great. It is amazing that all great actors don&#x27;t
hesitate to do what the role needs. For instance, DiCaprio and Brad
Pitt will do anything what the role takes. To be mad in 12 monkeys or
so. <br /><br />The movie is complete. Interesting. Even emotional, a father would do
anything to live with his wife even in a world of dreams, but more than
everything, to see his children again.<br /><br />Inception is a very clear movie (but don&#x27;t rush! Follow the pace of
it!), very direct, so full of human emotions..., I don&#x27;t need to say
more, this movie is COMPLETE in any aspect. You can&#x27;t say it for
Matrix, maybe the first part is a complete surprise, but the other two
are just bad copies of it. But, it is not clear as this one.<br /><br />Why do I compare these two movies? Because they are so different than
the other movies and talk about &#x27;dimensions&#x27; which are not so easily
for digestion for our mind. Inception won. A great idea was led very
good, and the final conclusion is also led to the clever ending. There
is no loose ends. A brilliant movie.
