Hailed as one of the best movies of the year, if not the last few
years, by critics the world over, one has to wonder, does it live up to
the hype? And undoubtedly, I have to answer with a resounding YES! It&#x27;s
highly inventive, disturbingly original, intellectually stimulating and
features some of the best visuals ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />Laying out the plot in simplistic terms is hard to do, but in a
nutshell, DiCaprio plays Don Cobb, a skilled thief. But he steals
thoughts and ideas which people have in their minds. It sounds
far-fetched obviously, but the movie makes it seem so realistic and
plausible that you don&#x27;t doubt it&#x27;s possibility for a single second.
When the movie opens, he unfortunately tries to steal from the wrong
person, and is faced with a choice: stay on the run or pull one last
job which would help to get his slate clean and in doing so, make him
able to go back home to America to his kids, where he&#x27;s a wanted
fugitive.<br /><br />The job though is the opposite of the norm, he has to infiltrate the
mind of Robert Fischer, and &#x22;plant&#x22; an idea. This is known as
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. He has to assemble a highly skilled team and so begins the
&#x22;heist&#x22;-like plot structure, albeit in a brand new fashion. This leads
to altered states of dreams and reality, and as the movie progresses,
our heroes have to race against time and take a journey fraught with
tension and danger, with their very futures hanging in the balance.<br /><br />To explain anymore of the plot would be to do it a major disservice, as
there are constant surprises around every corner. And there will
obviously be those who are going to voice their dislike of the movie,
maybe due to their lack of patience for the plot to &#x22;explain itself&#x22;.
But I believe if you concentrate fully and pay the required attention,
this movie will reward your intellect and never disappoint your
invested time. Also, the visual effects are out of this world,
sometimes literally. You see a fist-fight in a hotel corridor which
rotates a full 360 degrees, you see the streets of Paris actually rise
up and land on top of itself, you see buildings crumble with
orchestra-like precision, and yet none of these scenes seem forced or
over-the-top.<br /><br />The acting is also superb, with DiCaprio once again showing his amazing
range and impressing yet again. The rest of cast are all excellent as
well, especially Marion Cotillard as Cobb&#x27;s wife, who keeps intruding
in his dreams and causing further trouble for him.<br /><br />The plot is shaped like a film noir classic of old, there&#x27;s the heist,
there&#x27;s the hero who has to do one last job, and there&#x27;s the dangerous
femme fatale who could be his downfall. And yet director Christopher
Nolan weaves it all together so succinctly that it&#x27;s unlike anything
you&#x27;ve ever seen before. Action-packed, thrilling, and bound to have
you in deep discussion long after the movie has ended, &#x22;Inception&#x22;
definitely requires a second or third viewing. Not because you need to
understand it, but because you want to relive it. A true masterpiece!
