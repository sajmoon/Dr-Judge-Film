...if your IQ is below 105, read about it before you watch it. If not,
watch and enjoy this cinematic experience.<br /><br />Judgement Categories<br /><br />Acting: 8.5/10 Graphics: 10/10 Accuracy: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Music: 9/10
Cinematography: 9/10 AVERAGE: 9.4/10<br /><br />Just my opinion.... but its really good.<br /><br />Honestly, hardly any other director could have pulled off such a
complicated script except the one that also brought us The Dark Knight.
Nolan is an absolute legend.<br /><br />DiCaprio stars in his first completely original film here, and his
acting is more authentic than ever, and this is a good thing, although
it is vastly overshadowed by all the amazing tech, and graphics.
