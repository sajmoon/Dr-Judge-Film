I have to address something. Just being curious, I read some of the 1
star reviews. And granted, if you don&#x27;t like the movie, that&#x27;s
perfectly understandable. Who says you have to like it? If you share
some legitimate views on why you didn&#x27;t like it, that&#x27;s fine. Some low
reviews actually have this, and that&#x27;s alright. But it really pisses me
off when I read 12 reviews in a row that say that anyone that likes
this is automatically an idiot because they don&#x27;t really get it and
just pretend that they do. Do you really think we&#x27;re that stupid? Most
favorable reviews complemented the plot, and talked thoroughly about
many of the details. And what gets me is that some of them admit that
they didn&#x27;t get it, but then go on to say that we&#x27;re stupid because we
pretend we do. Do you really think that this would get a 9.1 solely on
people that pretend that they understand this? And it&#x27;s not just this
movie, these reviews are on a ton of other complex movies like
mulholland dr. I can understand if it was just completely muddled and
incoherent, but to say that everyone who like inception is just dumb
sounds completely close-minded. USE ACTUAL REASONING TO BACK UP WHY YOU
DON&#x27;T LIKE IT.<br /><br />Whew. Alright. Onto the review.<br /><br />I&#x27;m gonna try to keep this short, because it&#x27;s hard to give a long
review without any spoilers. This is one of those movies where at the
end you&#x27;re emotionally drained. And it&#x27;s for a good reason. It&#x27;s been
such a long time since we&#x27;ve gotten a movie that doesn&#x27;t treat it&#x27;s
audience like complete morons. Along with a complex plot, we also get
some great characters, sub- plots, and effects that actually contribute
to the story (*Cough Cough Avatar*). But where this movie really gets
you is the emotional hold it has on you. I don&#x27;t want to give anything
away, because the less you know the better, but by the end you feel so
many different emotions that it takes you a little to even realize that
what you just saw was freaking awesome. And that&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t
get much anymore. So stop reading reviews and go see this masterpiece.
In fact, why are you still reading this? Go see it right now!<br /><br />A deserving 9.7/10
