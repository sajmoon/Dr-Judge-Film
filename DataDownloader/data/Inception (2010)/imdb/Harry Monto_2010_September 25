This is an movie that has been able to make such a connection to me,
that it is amazing. I think this is the best movie of the decade if not
all time. Christopher Nolan is the new Hitchcock. Although Hitchcock is
the father of movies, Nolan is the his &#x22;younger brother.&#x22; This movie is
such a work of genius that it is amazing that it is by one man. I also
commend him on using minimal CGI. This quite a hard one to do that. I
have been very inspired by his work to create my movies to be like his.
Nothing bad can be said by me about this movie, if anything it would be
just a minor detail of very little importance. I just hope they don&#x27;t
make a sequel to this. It would never be nearly as good and would give
away the special ending.
