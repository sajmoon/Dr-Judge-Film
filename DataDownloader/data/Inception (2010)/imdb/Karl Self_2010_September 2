&#x22;Inception&#x22; is certainly the cinematic equivalent to a roller coaster
ride. It also features unique, creative imagery, and an equally
creative premise: a company has created a technology to intrude dreams
to manipulate thoughts. They can insert hired dreamers into one
person&#x27;s dream, ideally with the intruders knowing they&#x27;re on a job and
the target dreamer being unaware that he is being manipulated.<br /><br />To make things even more complicated, dreamers can dream within dreams,
and things happen faster in dreams than in reality. And &#x22;inserters&#x22; can
create places and settings and adopt different appearances. This makes
the setup pretty complicated to understand -- you probably won&#x27;t get it
all in the first viewing. To aggravate matters, the rest of the plot is
long and winding like the Chinese wall, and action-packed like a He-Man
episode.<br /><br />I&#x27;d call this a big-explosions blockbuster with brains. Personally I
wasn&#x27;t able to fully buy the premise -- for all the action, I didn&#x27;t
see how burglaring a dream could lead to change one person&#x27;s thoughts,
so I wasn&#x27;t able to sit back and enjoy it as much as I&#x27;d have liked to.
