With &#x22;Inception,&#x22; Christopher Nolan doesn&#x27;t necessarily raise any big
questions&#x97;He&#x27;s more of an exclamation point guy. Shame on me. I don&#x27;t
know why I ever let myself believe that the giant summer blockbuster
from the director of &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; would be anything other than an
action movie first and foremost. It was an error of judgment on my
part, and one I don&#x27;t intend to hold against it.<br /><br />While not entirely absent, the cerebral drama I thought I paid for rode
along the margins. Nolan, who beyond &#x22;Batman,&#x22; also directed &#x22;Memento&#x22;
and &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; among others, is great at dialing back the
complexity of his narratives to their most accessible level. This means
&#x22;Inception,&#x22; particularly in its first half, leans against a
scaffolding of exposition, on which characters glassily explain how the
business of dream invasion and information extraction works, right down
to its subtlest intricacies. It can easily become grating, but the
transparency of the writing is somewhat forgiven by the strength of the
performances, and the not-so-insignificant fact that it exists purely
to deliver an incredible, uninterrupted finale. Honestly, the sooner
you stop expecting &#x22;Inception&#x22; to challenge you, the more you&#x27;ll enjoy
it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard to say on first viewing whether any of that exposition could
be cut without compromising audience understanding of the events that
unfold&#x97;Essentially &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a reverse heist film, with a crack
team of dream spelunkers (Leo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen
Page) attempting to &#x27;plant&#x27; an idea in the subconscious psyche of the
heir to a corporate mogul&#x27;s empire (Cillian Murphy)&#x97;But even at his
most condescendingly explanatory, Nolan runs at a brisk pace; he
forgoes atmosphere in favor of adrenaline.<br /><br />And there I do take issue. Maybe I bring my own dream experience into
the equation, but when I remember my dreams, I more often recall
abstract feelings than concrete cause and effect. Conversely, it seems
Nolan&#x27;s dreams are all about events&#x97;Meetings, kidnappings, James Bond
compound infiltrations. It&#x27;s all very exciting, but not as emotionally
transporting as I would have hoped.<br /><br />But then it&#x27;s not Colin George&#x27;s &#x22;Inception,&#x22; and my dreams run
antithetical to Nolan&#x27;s greater intent. His film isn&#x27;t faux sci-fi gone
sour, it&#x27;s a smarter than average thriller, and taken in thriller
context, its unquestionable genre elevation. Here Nolan not only crafts
visually distinct, memorable action scenes, but he understands that
those scenes carry weight only because of their context to his
characters&#x27; journey.<br /><br />Precisely for that reason, the opening of the film did little for me.
It makes all the sense in the world to begin with an elaborate dream
sequence gone awry, but without immediately knowing what&#x27;s at stake, we
have no reason to root for the characters or care about what they&#x27;re
doing&#x97;Beyond the fact that it all looks gorgeous. Nolan finds his
footing when he introduces Page as DiCaprio&#x27;s prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, and as an outlet
for the exposition, she keeps the audience in the loop. Granted, it&#x27;s
not the most elegant solution, but without it, &#x22;Inception&#x22; runs the
risk of spiraling into entropy.<br /><br />Simply put, it isn&#x27;t the sort of film that deserves to be critically
scrutinized, playing just a few short weeks after Shyamalan&#x27;s snoozy
&#x22;Airbender&#x22; and barely a month removed from the inept action comedy,
&#x22;Killers.&#x22; By no means a perfect film, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is damn near the
perfect summer film, and during an unusually tepid season, it&#x27;s
exciting just to see someone brave enough to get into the water.<br /><br />And Nolan puts his head under. It may not have been the revelation I
stupidly expected, but &#x22;Inception&#x22; backs up brawn with brains, and
that&#x27;s what the director does best. Whether he&#x27;s working within the
guidelines of comic book canon or acting as the architect of his own
worlds, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily innovate&#x97;But he always reinvents.
Exclamation point.
