I am fascinated by the range of opinions people have about this film
and I am astonished that people have rated it highly. Some people have
even suggested this is one of the top 5 films of all time. Bizarre.<br /><br />What Inception really reminded me of was the Emporer&#x27;s New Clothes. If
enough people say something is great a lot of others are likely to be
swept along by the idea, frightened to go against popular opinion. Well
I&#x27;m glad that a lot of people have been honest enough to say that this
film is not half as good as the marketing department would have us
believe.<br /><br />The latest I heard from the pluggers was the film has to be seen more
than once to appreciate it. Ha! Good try guys but I can&#x27;t imagine
anyone being prepared to give this another try.<br /><br />The script made no sense and the characters were unbelievable. Worst of
all, I felt no attachment for any of the characters and did not care
what happened to them.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a meaningless, uninspired waste of time.
Unoriginal idea, weak script, insipid acting, plot and logic holes
galore do not add up to a blockbuster. The film gets 4 marks for the
impressive CGI but loses 2 of those for the derivative James Bond
sequence.<br /><br />The lady to my left spent the last two hours sound asleep. I was very
jealous of her.
