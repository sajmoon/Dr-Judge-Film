I checked engraved my euro, I&#x27;m awake, it&#x27;s true I&#x27;m sitting in a chair
watching this movie. I&#x27;cant escape, I have to wait for the end. A good
idea, fine actors, explosions, exotic locations, and special effects
put them in a bag,mix them and this case you don&#x27;t get a movie. There
is no plot or scenario when the writers or director did get stacked, it
was very easy: it&#x27;s a dream. I thought the film was all about the
manipulation of the brain and effect on human behavior. But after 30
minutes I was looking at ordinary action film with people shooting but
not did get hurt, buildings that erased, turned or collapsed. The whole
universe in this film looked like a comic book, only cardboard
characters. Instead of seeing this movie, take a nap and make you own
dream.
