In a plan to go home and see his children skilled thief Cobb (Di
Caprio) must plant an idea in a young man&#x27;s mind but he is forever
troubled by his memories of his wife.<br /><br />Ever since the release of The Dark Knight a few years ago many have
wondered what Chris Nolan&#x27;s next step would be and after months of
speculation and a glorious viral marketing scheme we have arguably one
of the greatest mind twisters of all time.<br /><br />Like his backwards mind twister Memento ten years ago the British
director gives us viewers another splendid treat with a psychological
story that uses stunning directional action sequences, perfect casting
and some mouth watering scenery to surely make Inception film of the
year material.<br /><br />Leo Di Caprio who many praised after his performance in Shutter Island
earlier this year manages to stabilise the film&#x27;s deeper darker moments
through a clever thought out performance. His character Cobb has had
trouble with the past and his memories. His clever mind at the
analysing and interpretation of dreams expands further and engages
audiences into a whole realm of possibilities. Cobb is a wonderful
professional but an imaginative troubled soul and this gives the story
a great balance against the heavy action sequences.<br /><br />Not since the Matrix has action ever been this cool. There are too many
unique moments to summarize here but one worthy mention is when the
city starts to turn in on itself and Ellen Page and Di Caprio are stood
in awe as you shall be by the sheer handling of this perfect sci-fi
sequence by Nolan. From rainy car chases to corridor fights to a heist
in the snowy mountains the adrenaline never stops pumping and if you
like your Bonds, Bourne&#x27;s and Indian Jones&#x27;s you will think Christmas
has come early.<br /><br />Further to the central masterstroke by the Titanic star Nolan has
brought in a wealth of experience and rising stars for his film.<br /><br />Michael Caine whilst only fleetingly stars is brilliant, Marion
Cotillard will sooner sprout wings than give a bad performance but even
this is exceptionally good for her. Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt
have both been rising quickly these last few years and in their
respective roles both are memorable but Levitt excels through some fine
balancing of seriousness professional and adding a dash of comedy
styling to.<br /><br />Nolan again picks up the action with a great subtle soundtrack that is
always perfect in capturing the moment. But his wide sweeping variety
of scenery and action montages, the back and forth settings are
staggering.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will be watched time and time again for its story
as it truly boggles the mind as it explores the fabrications of reality
and how we dream, think, feel, suffer and explicate the human race. For
one I would strongly recommend watching this to have your mind well and
truly warped.
