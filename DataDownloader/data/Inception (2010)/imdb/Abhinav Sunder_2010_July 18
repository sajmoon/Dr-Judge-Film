Inception is a film with such brilliance involved in its thinking that
it makes James Cameron&#x27;s over rated Avatar look like a pin ball inside
a massive football stadium. Pardon me if I&#x27; am overdoing it, but I just
can&#x27;t come out of the experience I had watching this gigantic piece of
cinema. Christopher Nolan, who gave us some of the finest films in the
millennium like Memento and The Dark Knight, proves it once again that
he has no suitable competitors presently.<br /><br />Now Leonardo DiCaprio is &#x27;Dom Cobb&#x27;, a high-end thief who can extract
information out of a sleeping person&#x27;s brain. Ken Watanabe plays
&#x27;Saito&#x27;, a business man who hires &#x27;Dom&#x27; to plant an idea inside the
brains of his foe, &#x27;Robert Fischer&#x27;, played by Cillian Murphy. &#x27;Saito&#x27;
opts to implant an idea instead of stealing one as this idea will
destroy the whole of his foe&#x27;s business empire! Soon we see &#x27;Dom&#x27; and
his exciting team setting out for the toughest challenge they have ever
witnessed, leaving the audience dumbstruck with the most exciting game
they have ever played! Now talking more about the premise or its
characters will only spill the beans over the fun of watching it; or to
be precise, the fun of figuring out what is actually happening. And I
hate to give out spoilers.<br /><br />The screenplay is par excellence, with a killer characterization given
to each person involved in the cast, which gives you a feel that you
know them all long back, right after you dig into the first few minutes
of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb is nothing less than a
stunner, where as the rest of the cast including Joseph Gordon, Tom
Hardy, Dileep Rao, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy and Ken
Watanabe blends into the characters. But its Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
screenplay, which constantly keeps you on the edge. You just don&#x27;t have
the time to rate the performances of the actors, when you already have
a tedious job of understanding the film! More over, the film is a mind
blowing visual extravaganza. Take for instance, the scene in which Dom
Cobb trains the dreamer, in a dream she has with the city bursting out
part by part, or even the scene in which the whole city folds itself
into a book! But don&#x27;t go into the cinema expecting some CGI driven
film, and that&#x27;s when you get completely lost. Because Inception is a
film that tests your Intelligence and concentration; its a film which
demands so much of attention that you might regret losing even a small
detail, when you blink for a second. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong on that;
Inception is not that film which shows off its intelligence, its that
film which defeats you with its intelligence. And its the best game I
have ever played.<br /><br />Now the biggest challenge Christopher Nolan might face in the future is
to outsmart his own creation. Because if Avatar was a landmark,
Inception is the ultimate. No matter what happens, a bomb scare or even
terrorist attack, never miss this one at the theaters. Its a film to
die for.<br /><br />My Rating: 5 / 5 PS: By the way, I recommend this film only to those
who have a minimum I.Q. level; because i hate it when people shout out
loud nonsense in the theater when they have perfectly no clue about
what is happening inside the film. If you can&#x27;t understand the
language, don&#x27;t go in to spoil the fun others are having!
