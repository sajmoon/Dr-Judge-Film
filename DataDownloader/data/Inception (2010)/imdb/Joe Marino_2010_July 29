It is extremely difficult for films today to actually deliver what
their trailer concepts promise. It seems that Hollywood can rarely
produce something that surprises us anymore. So when the &#x22;Inception&#x22;
trailer first appeared online, I expected massive disappointment. It
just had that look of being too ambitious and imaginative for its own
good. I feared it would ultimately drown in its own attempted
originality.<br /><br />I was wrong. This movie blew me away. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is what happens when
a true visionary finds a unique story that hasn&#x27;t been told before and
tells it in the most breathtaking way possible. This is the type of
cinematic masterpiece that comes along only once in every generation.<br /><br />A story that rivals the writing of Charlie Kaufman, the action of
Michael Mann, and the heart and emotion of Alan Ball, this movie will
stand for years to come as to what magnificent storytelling heights
films are capable of today.<br /><br />The story is about a man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio; &#x22;Shutter
Island&#x22;), a professional &#x27;dream thief&#x27; who enters the dreams of
high-powered individuals and steals valuable information from their
subconsciousness for those who are willing to pay for those
&#x27;inaccessible&#x27; secrets. When a client (Ken Watanabe; &#x22;The Last
Samurai&#x22;) hires him and his team members - including Arthur (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt; &#x22;(500) Days of Summer&#x22;), Ariadne (Ellen Page; &#x22;Juno&#x22;),
and Eames (Tom Hardy; &#x22;Rock n&#x27; Rolla&#x22;) - to go inside the mind of the
rich son (Cillian Murphy; &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;) of the owner of a
multi-billion dollar company and actually implant a memory (the meaning
of inception), Cobb is promised that this last job will get him what he
has dreamed of for years &#x96; back to his family. But when Cobb&#x27;s tragic
past begins to push its way through his consciousness and attacks their
plans of inception, the team must do everything in their power to keep
all levels of reality in check in order to succeed and survive.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie isn&#x27;t just the best film of 2010 or one of the
best science-fiction film in years. It&#x27;s also one of the greatest
movie-going experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. I just can&#x27;t contain myself. I
just loved every single frame of this movie. This isn&#x27;t just &#x22;The
Matrix&#x22; for the new generation. Better yet, this is what &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;
should have been.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan flawlessly combines complexity, originality,
and ambitious storytelling to weave together a film that without
exaggeration is unlike anything we&#x27;ve seen before. As shown with
&#x22;Memento&#x22; in 2000, Nolan doesn&#x27;t overly concerned himself with the
fickleness of mainstream appeal or special efforts. All he has ever
concerns himself with is telling the best story imaginable. That&#x27;s what
makes Nolan great &#x96; his utter dedication to the story being above
anything else. It was a robbery that Nolan didn&#x27;t get an Oscar nod for
Best Original Screenplay for &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; - so here&#x27;s hoping the
Academy may make up for that erroneous mistake by actually noticing how
brilliant this script is. &#x22;Inception&#x22; may, like several science-fiction
movies did last year, have transcended its own genre, which is a very
rare and wondrous thing to behold.<br /><br />As good as the story is, Nolan makes sure the effects aren&#x27;t slouching.
Remember the first time you saw the action scenes from &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; and
found yourself completely awed by the sheer scope and uniqueness? Well,
that was so 90s. &#x22;Inception&#x22; takes fight scenes to a whole new level
with fight scenes. The zero-gravity hallway brawl with Levitt is
mesmerizing, with the fight going from the floor to the walls to the
ceiling. Every fight scene, be it normal or not, just has this feeling
of freshness.<br /><br />Also, the sense of detail is astounding and awe-inspiring. This talent
is especially relevant during the first time Cobb takes the newbie
&#x27;architect&#x27; Ariadne into the dream world and we see just how
manipulatable the world is when she literally turns the busy New York
town inside out. This is where Nolan&#x27;s technical wizardry just shines
to Oscar heights. Every visual shot is beautifully constructed, with
money shot after money shot gracing the screen. My two favorite moments
were where Ariadne manipulates Cobb&#x27;s dream and the jaw-dropping last
half-hour which involves a flawless and complex editing job of
inter-cutting five different realities and events coherently.<br /><br />On that note, this whole film is deserving of massive awards attention
a few months from now. This is especially top-notch directing, writing,
and cinematography. The acting of the cast should get some recognition
as well.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio apparently just can&#x27;t be stopped in his ambitious
rise to becoming one of the greatest actors in Hollywood. This just
might be the year Leo actually wins himself an Oscar with his
monumental acting chops in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22; and now
with &#x22;Inception.&#x22; In the last decade, we&#x27;ve seen this guy rise from
teenage heartthrob to a true actor&#x27;s actor. His emotional versatility
has never been as prominent as it has this year, and Nolan&#x27;s screenplay
perfectly compliments DiCaprio&#x27;s talents in molding a character who is
the heart and soul of this story. Without Cobb&#x27;s heartfelt
characterization, this film wouldn&#x27;t have been nearly as good. He
shines in each and every scene dealing with his wife (Marion Cotillard;
&#x22;Public Enemies&#x22;) and their past together. We can totally sympathize
and understand how Cobb&#x27;s raw obsession of the fate of his family
haunts his every waking moment.<br /><br />In the end, this is a groundbreaking epic that will go down in history
as being one of the greats. This is going to be what most sci-fi
writers are going to aspire to. Nolan already proved that he is capable
of masquerading a cinematic masterpiece as your average summer
blockbuster with &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight.&#x22; This is simply
another example of his uniqueness as a filmmaker. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is truly
Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece &#x96; and considering Nolan&#x27;s previous brilliance, that
says a lot.
