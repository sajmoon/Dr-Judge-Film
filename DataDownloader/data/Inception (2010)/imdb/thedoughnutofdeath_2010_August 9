I have seen this movie 5 times now, and I plan to go back again for
IMAX. Literally, it is the best movie I have ever seen. <br /><br />I&#x27;m not writing this from a critic&#x27;s standpoint or anything, it is just
&#x22;pure creation&#x22;. <br /><br />Though it is confusing at the beginning, it definitely resolves in the
end to what is an enthralling and suspenseful ending.<br /><br />This 2 and a half hour movie passes in what seems like 2 seconds, and
the brilliant special effects, storyline, and acting will hold you all
the way through to the gripping end.<br /><br />GO. SEE. INCEPTION. NOW.
