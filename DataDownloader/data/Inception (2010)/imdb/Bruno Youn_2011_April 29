What a great and unique movie! Inception has strong acting
performances, outstanding visual effects, a superb music score by Hans
Zimmer and of course, a mysterious and intelligent script that leads to
a mesmerizing and thrilling climax. It&#x27;s a challenging and complex
masterpiece that makes you engage your intellect.<br /><br />Just like in previous movies such as Memento and The Prestige,
Chistopher Nolan once again explores really well the non-chronological
aspect of the narrative by making us develop ideas and possibilities
along its course until the very end of it. It&#x27;s not predictable nor
definite, but open for different scenarios and opinions.<br /><br />The action sequences are dazzling and you practically can&#x27;t take your
eyes off the screen if you don&#x27;t want to miss one single detail of the
story. The dialogs are very well constructed and the layers of the
dream world just show you the explosion of creativity by Nolan&#x27;s mind,
making Inception one of the best movie experiences of all time.
