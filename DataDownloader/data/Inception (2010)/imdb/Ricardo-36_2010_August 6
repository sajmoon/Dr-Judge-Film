Inception is a movie based on an Excellent idea that, if put on the
wrong hands - that is, anyone but Nolan and maybe Pixar - would be
ruined. This is not the case here: a brilliant, well constructed
thriller that, although being quite simple, is of a VERY complex
nature. Nolan could have spent more time explaining the structure of
this universe, but he leaves the story to explain it - only using a
couple of scenes between DiCaprio and Ellen Page to explain what could
not be explained outside the movie&#x27;s plot. Truly a movie that will be
kept in your mind for a long time, and praised as one of the best ever
conceived - a mix between the intelligence of Memento, the tension of
men-on-the-job thrillers like Ronin or Munich, and the dreamlike
environment of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />This movie, however, it&#x27;s not without flaws. Ellen Page, as ever,
&#x22;sinks&#x22; the movie with her sub par acting and her &#x22;teenage&#x22; acting
stance, in a role that should require something better or more mature. <br /><br />(Di Caprio is competent enough, Cotillard plays it safe, Cillian Murphy
was brilliantly cast, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt FINALLY delivers
something good enough to take him serious as an adult and serious
actor).<br /><br />Also, some of the mechanics and rules of the whole dream world gets
lost with the fast pace of the movie. Filming dreams is always a
problem due to the nature of dreams, they are too abstract for movies -
and unless you pull a Felinni and do one hell of a misce en scene, you
are bound to fail, as people won&#x27;t buy it. I couldn&#x27;t quite buy the
whole thing, but Nolan keeps the whole suspension of disbelief going on
pretty well so the movie isn&#x27;t ruined, or not even scratched.<br /><br />But... while far from perfect, it was possibly along with Toy Story 3
the best movie this year, and one of Nolan&#x27;s best effort, up there with
Memento and The Dark Knight. Surely a movie you SHOULD NOT miss. It has
its critics - just see the user reviews on IMDb - but that is the final
stroke of genius on this film: you gotta be intelligent to appreciate
it. Sheep-like-minded limited individuals will HATE it. And all I can
do is smile as I see confused faces come out of the movie theater -
poor, poor minds...
