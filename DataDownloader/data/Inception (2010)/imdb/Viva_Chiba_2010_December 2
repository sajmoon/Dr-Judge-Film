NOTE: Nolan fanboys are going to hate my review, don&#x27;t even bother to
send me PM&#x27;s saying &#x22;U SUCK, YOUR TASTE SUX&#x22;. Don&#x27;t even bother to
report this review hoping that someone will delete it, it will prove
that fanboys are a bunch of keyboard warriors trying to &#x22;deffend&#x22;
everything in the most ridiculous way.<br /><br />Everyone is saying that this is the best movie of the year and saying
that &#x22;it looks like an Alfred Hitchcok movie&#x22;....it doesn&#x27;t even come
close from the masterpieces of Hitchcok ! Everyone gave this movie a 10
star rating even if they didn&#x27;t saw it, because it was from the
director of The Dark Knight (another disappointment, but less painful
than this piece of crap), the audience are a bunch of sheeps.<br /><br />The story is predictable, the twists are predictable, the action scenes
sucks, they sucked so much that i almost missed the &#x22;action&#x22; sequence
of the Transformers movies (the live action ones).<br /><br />Why i give this movie a 2 stars ? one star for the cast and another one
for the musical score.<br /><br />UPDATE: i had the misfortune to rewatch this piece of crap and my vote
is 1, truly awful.
