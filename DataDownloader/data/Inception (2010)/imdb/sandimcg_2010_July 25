I was totally entertained by this complex movie with some surprising
twists and a novel idea made completely believable. We (4 of us) enjoy
sci-fi, which might be a must. People who cannot suspend belief
wouldn&#x27;t enjoy this movie (or many others that come to mind). I was
worried that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough explanation for some viewers -
those who have trouble catching onto what is going on when a movie is
fast-paced and has a lot of twists, but the writers did a great job
with that. Even my elderly mom would enjoy watching this movie. It&#x27;s
refreshing to have some complicated suspense as to what is happening
and what is going to happen. The clever plot kept you on the edge of
your seat (at least it worked for our group). I would definitely enjoy
seeing &#x22;Inception&#x22; again -- a rarity for me.
