Well to speak Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movie memento i saw some what quiet a
long time ago i just came into the genre of unfolding events but it was
an exceptional movie to watch and i said man i have to check out who is
the maker of this film i was hoping for some biggie should be behind
its making and then i came to know Christopher Nolan and for years he
has done very less films and delivered us all his potential great
movies to entertain the audience.<br /><br />And Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a
remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the
matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from
all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of
all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the
characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your
eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you.
