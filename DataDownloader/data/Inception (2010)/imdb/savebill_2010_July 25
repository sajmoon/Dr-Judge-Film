..is wrong with you people? It seems that most &#x22;smart&#x22; viewers were so
busy trying to keep up with the stupid plot that they had no mental
energy left for common sense, taste or critical thinking. The
experience became unbearable as soon as the first action scene of the
lets-plant-the-idea-mission began.<br /><br />As an odd coincidence my nose started running at the same time -
heavily and nonstop. Having no handkerchiefs with me I had to wipe it
barehanded until the end of the movie! This in a theater full of poor
people like me also misled by the hype.<br /><br />It was probably my immune system trying its best to make me leave the
seat.
