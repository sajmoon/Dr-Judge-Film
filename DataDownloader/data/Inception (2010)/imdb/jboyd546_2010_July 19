I saw this extraordinary film last night, and for the first time i can
think of i left the cinema 100% satisfied with what i had seen.
Christopher Nolan had proved himself as one of todays top film makers
with 2008&#x27;s smash hit The Dark Knight, and with Inception he makes his
other landmark screenplay, Memento, seem like a distant memory. Every
aspect of this film has raised and set the bar for all other films to
aspire to.<br /><br />The complexity of the plot will inevitably draw certain comparisons
with the matrix but Nolan&#x27;s work with the pen surpasses the Wachowski&#x27;s
due to the simple fact that by the end the audience aren&#x27;t left with a
million open ends. 1 or 2 things may leave viewers asking questions and
certain aspects can be interpreted in multiple ways which will ensure
that this films hype will not die down anytime soon.<br /><br />The special effects and set pieces are a marvel surpassed only by
Nolan&#x27;s plot. From zero gravity hallways to snow capped mountains and
winding Indian streets. Not one scene in this movie will have you
checking your watch, this is edge-of-your-seat cinema at it&#x27;s thrilling
best.<br /><br />One thing i noticed in this movie that i&#x27;ve never paid particular
attention to before was the sound. I could feel the world of dreams
engulf me from all angles, something which i have never noticed before,
hands down to Hans Zimmer who has crafted a score more powerful than
that of The Dark Knight. This is a haunting score which helps build the
tension of the scenes without ever going to far, he should have his
fingers crossed for another Academy Award nomination and possibly
another win (which would be his only Oscar other than The Lion King)<br /><br />Finally the acting, Leonardo Dicaprio proved he could act at a young
age and in my opinion he has grown and matured as an actor, with both
Inception and Shutter Island showcasing his talent in 2010 this is one
actor who cant be over looked, he plays the action character here but
the fantastic scrip allows him to develop the persona of Cobb, as the
conflicted hero struggling with his hidden truths. Tom Hardy is growing
as an actor and in Inception we can see another dimension to this
rising British star. Ellen Page shine&#x27;s as always as the newest member
of Cobbs crack team of dream thieves, and Ken Watanabe commanding
presence is well received as Cobb&#x27;s one chance for redemption. The
entire cast play their parts to perfection but i felt that Marion
Cotillard was the strongest in this fantastic ensemble, her performance
was mesmerising although it is difficult to explain further without
revealing anything about the movie, but you&#x27;ll understand when you see
the movie. The chemistry she share&#x27;s with DiCaprio is amongst the best
i&#x27;ve seen in a long long time.<br /><br />This has to be in contention for Oscars already, it knocks The Dark
Knight out of the ring and Nolan has to be a safe bet for Best Director
and Original Screenplay even at this early stage of the season i
predict fantastic award success for this film and all its cast and
crew.
