I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like
most of DiCaprio&#x27;s films, it blew me away.<br /><br />Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over
the world. The directing was outstanding, there where many action
packed and visually amazing scenes&#x27;s that made me want to clap but
sadly I was in a packed movie theater.<br /><br />The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn,
keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. It&#x27;s great to see a movie
with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action
heroes who achieve greatness in the end. Nolan never disappoints his
audience and especially does not fail in this epic movie. It was
obviously one of Christopher&#x27;s best films. If you do not watch many
Twisting and Confusing movies prepare to be thrown in a never ending
labyrinth. Personally I did not get confused at all,but some people
walked out of the theater with many Question Marks over there heads.<br /><br />Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the
finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you&#x27;re thinking about seeing
Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a
free show, it is worth every penny you pay.<br /><br />Truly unique, like nothing i&#x27;ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan
certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn&#x27;t afraid to leave
us hanging with a spectacular ending.
