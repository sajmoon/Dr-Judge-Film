Have been to the Sony Center Cinema (Berlin) tonight, and left if
DEEPLY impressed!<br /><br />The Movie is - what I call a &#x27;oasis&#x27; in a huge desert of usual boring
films, that you know what they end with right from the first sequences!
Exactly what I needed! Very inspiring, stimulating, surprising! <br /><br />Thank you guys, who CREATED this masterpiece.. This is the future of
cinematography... A new genre...<br /><br />Of course many will criticize the movie, for many reasons! Just like
many controversial masterpieces that influenced a decade were first
outlaughed... The problem is - many of the bad comments come from
people who didn&#x27;t even watch the movie properly. Many just saw bits and
promo sequences, and right after got ready to criticize it...<br /><br />And really - am sure - very few people in the cinema understood the
depth of the ideas and the message of the movie... Needs to be watched
several times...<br /><br />thanks damyan
