Spectatvm venivnt, venivnt spectentvr vt ipsae.<br /><br />They come to see, they come that they themselves be seen to see and be
seen.<br /><br />What are the two most stunning and original episodes of an action
packed mega-flick &#x22;Inception&#x22;? For me, with no doubt, shock number one
is an amazing fold of Paris defying all gravity laws. My second visual
daze came when a mystic infinity of an archway was so suddenly
originated between huge sheets of mirrors. Why amidst loads of
incredible visual effects these conceptually simple scenes are so
outstanding? Maybe, because the main part in both of them is played by
Architecture&#x85;<br /><br />As I watched &#x22;Inception&#x22; I got few really peculiar observations. Sure
I&#x27;m not a movie columnist but an amateur who loves cinema, thus my
thoughts are not a critique in any manner. However I&#x27;m a professional
architect and since the most active and sexy character in the film is&#x85;
Architecture (sorry Leo!) I&#x27;ll dare to review a bizarre architecture of
Inception.<br /><br />New dimension with no fake tricks<br /><br />A weird thing for a futuristic sci-fi: there are no sleek computers
with translucent wall-size screens (Minority Report), no fancy gadgets
full of pulsating lights (actually the only technical tool I&#x27;ve seen
was a vintage metal case with archaic pump and rubber tubes), not even
cell-phones! The other remarkable detail: world of architectural
fantasies has no futuristic urban landscapes with gigantic video-ad&#x27;s,
(Oh, &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22;), no oddly shaped skyscrapers (&#x22;Star wars&#x22;), no
sterile-white interiors (&#x22;The Island&#x22;).<br /><br />On contrary we&#x27;re constantly introduced to the beautifully calm
old-fashioned hotels or romantic scenery of French capital. What&#x27;s all
that? Gifted young architect Ariadne (a cute reference to the
labyrinths of Greek mythology) could be really more productive using
one of those shiny Apple machines for design of her complex mazes on
multiple levels of subconscious worlds. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense? And yet
she&#x27;s doing it old school &#x96; card-board models, sketches, hand drawings
pinned on the wall&#x85; Why? What those conservative traits and classic
facades are doing in the dreamy land full of infinite possibilities?<br /><br />It&#x27;s clearly more than director&#x27;s attempt to maintain certain style
line of a cool vintage look. Thing is, they are trying to form a new
dimension. A dimension built from time-space interlacement. Such
interlacement somehow fantastically happens in our dreams. And I find
it very honest that in order to present, to explore this wonderfully
scary new dimension authors are not using those fake exterior features
I&#x27;ve mentioned above. Instead they daringly manipulate with the
fundamental characteristics of the space we are so accustomed to.<br /><br />That&#x27;s why we are so astonished with a scene of a folding panorama of
Paris, when people walk out of the regular 3D world, as so familiar and
comfortable to us Cartesian coordinates system stops working the way it
should. And yet Codd and Ariadne continue to walk on the paved street
as nothing happened. Everything suddenly is twisted and shaken without
artificial gimmicks. The very core of the space as we know it &#x96; is
lacerated, raped, changed forever. I love it. An organic simple &#x22;walk
on the ceiling&#x22; of classical Paris is so cool and natural. (Way cooler
than all those freakishly extruded by soulless software building
shapes, which starchitects are desperately trying to introduce as a
breakthrough into another dimension. Well, now we can see how false it
is. Ariadne is better architect than Zaha.)<br /><br />Smokes and mirrors.<br /><br />The main definition of this dreamy reality is Maze. Labyrinth. That&#x27;s
the only architectural program Ariadne (still remember the Greeks,
right?) is given by her client. So how do you design a mystic infinite
space linked to the relativity of time in that new dimension? The
Architect is using most transcendental tool &#x96; mirror. It&#x27;s a stroke of
genius. Two otherworldly (and yet utterly physical) philosophical
substances &#x96; labyrinth and mirror are perfectly bound into one whole of
a spiritual synthesis.<br /><br />Oh, great blind man, Jorge Luis Borges! &#x96; you&#x27;ve seen it so clearly in
your phantasmagorical labyrinths of nightmares:<br /><br />I look on them as infinite, elemental fulfillers of a very ancient pact
to multiply the world, as in the act of generation, sleepless and
dangerous.<br /><br />&#x22;Mirrors&#x22; (translated by Reid)<br /><br />In those endless reflections of archways running between the two
mirrors placed against each other by the Architect an irrational
rationality of the dream becomes so obvious. And when the mirror is
shuttered &#x96; nothing changes: the sheer architectural prospective is
blended flawlessly into the dangerously real imagination.<br /><br />I truly respect this unpretentious approach. It&#x27;s not cheap symbolism
but metaphorical depth of human intelligence. It&#x27;s an art. It&#x27;s a
philosophy. It&#x27;s Architecture. It&#x27;s a dream.<br /><br />And there&#x27;s no way in the world that sophisticated software would ever
compete with architect&#x27;s imagination that is able to project a magic
into the existence and to turn a reality into the dream.<br /><br />P.S. Funny, but I didn&#x27;t like the movie actually. &#x22;ExistenZ&#x22; is way
cooler.
