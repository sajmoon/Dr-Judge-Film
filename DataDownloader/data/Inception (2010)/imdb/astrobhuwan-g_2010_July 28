Inception is a masterpiece of Christopher Nolan. I clearly see the
future of mankind may turn like the movie itself. The movie is already
rated as one of the best all-time in IMDb.. The reasons are its quality
and after effects which makes the audience be taken into the movie
itself.<br /><br />If anyone is wondering if the final part is Cobb&#x27;s dream or reality
then it is a reality. f you notice, whenever Cobb is in a dream, his
wedding ring is on and whenever he is in reality, its not. In the final
part its not, so he is in reality. The whole dream is a inception for
the audience as we keep on wondering if its a dream or a reality.<br /><br />( unless Mr Nolan has something else)
