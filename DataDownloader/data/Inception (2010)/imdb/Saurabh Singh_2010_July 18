Somehow I missed all the hype for the movie. Only realized about it
when few of my friends gave strong reviews for it. The movie actually
deserves a whole new adjective for itself - &#x27;Inceptionally Good&#x27;. It
takes you into a maze, something which they keep on creating in the
movie, and if you miss few plots or scenes you would be lost there
somewhere not been able to find your way out. It exhausts your mind.
You come out of theater tired but still wanting more of it.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t like to give the plot or storyline as many of other
reviewers have already put it in all possible ways. Brilliant shots -
all of them feel as close to reality as possible. I am going for the
movie again and suggest you the same. Its another masterpiece from
Nolan!
