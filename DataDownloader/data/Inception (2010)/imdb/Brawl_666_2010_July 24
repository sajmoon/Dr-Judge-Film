In Chris Nolan&#x27;s films, the narrative (and not anything else) is the
main character, the center around which all else assembles. In terms of
narrative complexity, this film doesn&#x27;t really hold a candle to what
&#x27;Memento&#x27; and &#x27;The Prestige&#x27; (or even &#x27;Following&#x27;) gave the viewer. The
narration is linear, and the story ultimately harbors no mysteries.
None at all. My guess is that all potential complexities were ironed
out in order to secure finance and avoid risk. Even the human drama is
totally unengaging and non-complex. This film doesn&#x27;t give the viewer
anything non-filmic to think about. Its a decent thrill ride, albeit
with a new concept.<br /><br />The &#x22;money idea&#x22; here is the notion of nesting dreams within dreams in
a potentially infinite sequence, like a Russian doll. This part of the
film is really done well, and I&#x27;m sure everyone must hold their breath
at the moment when all four (five?) levels &#x22;synchronize&#x22; and the &#x22;kick&#x22;
is transmitted top to bottom.<br /><br />I suppose Nolan and his group must get credit simply for attempting
something like this. Unfortunately there are problems here. The biggest
one is how the dreams are constructed. They are mere action set-pieces.
This is certainly not how we dream, not at all. Even allowing that, the
dull and careless way in which the film is shot and edited is jarring.
Worse, all the different levels are shot in the same visual style;
there is no way to distinguish a dream state from reality, even when
the viewer knows its a dream. Compare this with Martin Scorsese&#x27;s use
of two distinct visual palettes in &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; : one was surreal,
and one prosaic; to denote two different states of mind. &#x27;Fight Club&#x27;
and &#x27;Matrix&#x27; come to mind too.<br /><br />Nolan prefers an extremely wordy exposition over showing things
visually. He expects viewers to understand concepts like the
&#x22;unconscious&#x22;, when truly speaking, few understand it well. Everyone
has heard the word; how many people have studied it as a psychoanalytic
concept proper ?? Even the particular interpretation that the
unconscious and lucid dreaming are given, it is all just way too
literal.<br /><br />With all due respect, someone needs to tell Chris Nolan to allow the
use of second units. I&#x27;m sorry, but it seems he just cant shoot a
decent action sequence to save his life. I&#x27;m surprised how no one has
pointed this out.<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; was financed for one reason, and one reason only. Think of
the amount of money that Batman 3 will make, if only they can get Nolan
on board. It will obliterate any losses that &#x27;Inception&#x27; may make.
