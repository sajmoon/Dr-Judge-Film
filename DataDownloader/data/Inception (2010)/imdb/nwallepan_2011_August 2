There are much better films than this with a similar concept or just
better writing. It&#x27;s not that anything necessarily went wrong here...
the concept is OK, the story is OK, the script is OK, the acting might
be even better than OK. I guess that leaves the production and
direction. And of course a majority of its reviewers disagree with me,
so whatever. This just isn&#x27;t a great movie. It certainly isn&#x27;t worthy
of it&#x27;s rating and status here and a lot of other places. I think maybe
it was over produced and designed. If it had been simplified into
something more Donnie Darko and less Matrix, at least it would have
been worthy of it&#x27;s better than average performances.
