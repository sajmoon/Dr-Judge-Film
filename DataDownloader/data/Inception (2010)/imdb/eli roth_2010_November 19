These kind of steps in movies...i dint see b4....Really Great to see
such Movies After Long time.....AM saying THese movie Beat AVATAR n all
big Directors movie BY Great Story telling....I would like to Consider
this movie for Study in world History..Thanx to Christoper Nolan For
gave such Cinematic Gem...Some Tell Understanding movie is big
Dilemma...Definitely yes if u popcorn something when u seen
it...Otherwise every second in movie makes u sit edge on the
seat...Then i must say something about Leo...he&#x27;s simply Perfect on his
role....Great acting....But Team work...Hans zimmer Background score
Mesmerizing us....then Breathtaking Visual effects......and I shd
thanks once again to Nolan for such a Great screenplay with top notch
thrill...Everyone shd see n feel the movie at least once in life... am
giving 10 out of 10 for this real Master piece!!
