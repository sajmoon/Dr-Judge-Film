Inception is an incredibly intelligent film with an intriguing and
detailed plot. To say the least, this film is not meant to be watched
passively; it is meant to be experienced in full form with complete
attention. The idea behind the story is original to say the least, and
engaging if understood.<br /><br />There has been some criticism for the lack of character development
that evolves throughout Inception, but the focus of this movie was much
more on the ideas of inception than anything else. Although a bit
confusing and controversial in terms of plot progression, this was the
intention of Christopher Nolan. The story was meant to be interpreted
in infinitely many ways, which is part of its charm; what would a good
intellectual film be if it didn&#x27;t make you think about it afterwords?<br /><br />Overall, Inception was executed perfectly for what it was meant to be,
a clever idea transformed into an exhaustive creation, with a few minor
plot holes in the making. Before you sit down to watch Inception, make
sure you are awake, alert, and comfortable, because it is quite a ride.
