In this world there are only two kinds of people, those who&#x27;ve seen
inception, and those who haven&#x27;t,Cos For me inception wasn&#x27;t just a
blockbuster, it was more of an experience, a life time, an education,
and when I say this, that&#x27;s is because it really added something to my
life, this movie makes you aware of whole new world that we didn&#x27;t know
except as a &#x27;resting period&#x27; in your day, &#x27;inception&#x27; makes this
resting period the most interesting period in your day. All my life
I&#x27;ve been obsessed with dreaming and wrote about my dreams, and watched
matrix for thousand times, But I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this
before ,it&#x27;s very realistic ,the best thing about Nolan in this movie
is that everything has a proof,just like a Mathematical equation, he
gives you the proof, then he extracts the events out of it, you don&#x27;t
need visual effects in this film to inter the atmosphere of dreams, the
lines will take you there,the scientific facts mentioned in the dialog.
Every thing seems very logical ,really when it comes to movies about
dreams this film exceeds,,yes i think this movie is pretty similar to
matrix, and i think that Nolan at some point of his life were a fan of
matrix, he even starred 2 of matrix actors in memento,and he used the
shared dreams concept,but he developed the concept and i don&#x27;t think
that this is wrong,nevertheless,the favor goes to matrix,matrix was the
inception of &#x27;inception&#x27;, you can call inception the next step in
movies about dreams. I was and still a big fan of matrix ,But to some
point in the film, when every thing seemed logical, but then the movie
began to slip<br /><br />On the contrary inception is devilishly perfect, the film has so many
layers that you really go deep inside it to the extent that when you
finish watching it you feel that you&#x27;re still not separated from it
that&#x27;s what excels about this film.
