Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a &#x27;sensational&#x27; film and a
mind-bending one like I&#x27;ve never seen before. And guess what ? I think
I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of
reviews with &#x22;Inception&#x22;, one within another (naturally) :<br /><br />REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />&#x22;This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic &#x22;Bohemian
Rhapsody&#x22; ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the
greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and
intelligent stories ... And still ... I don&#x27;t know how to feel ...
Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel
something messy now in my mind, and that I can&#x27;t get out ... I need to
watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ...
it&#x27;s so disturbing it&#x27;s great, so great it&#x27;s disturbing ...&#x22; 10/10<br /><br />This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the
immediate one, one that couldn&#x27;t be altered by other viewer&#x27;s opinions,
praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A
second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...<br /><br />REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />&#x22;It&#x27;s a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an
intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have
a &#x27;heart&#x27; beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I
understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the
emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset,
believe me, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is an incredible experience. The movie is a
fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it&#x27;s real because we
know it&#x27;s fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can
technically live in. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about dreams and
subconsciousness, because it&#x27;s all about actual and virtual reality,
perceptions and intentions. As a script, it&#x27;s a very impressive work
from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I
know I&#x27;m watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle
that challenges my intelligence. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is like a cinematic
Rubik&#x27;s cube.&#x22; 9,5/10<br /><br />I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede
that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction
of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the
whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama,
necessary to plunge us in Cobb&#x27;s subconscious and inject it into
Fisher&#x27;s dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative
structures. In such action-driven films, &#x27;forced&#x27; is &#x27;flat&#x27; and
melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as
excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric,
almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...<br /><br />REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />&#x22;It&#x27;s a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original
Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best
Cinematography. If it didn&#x27;t, there would be no justice!&#x22; 8/10<br /><br />I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured
great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the
word &#x27;sensational&#x27; I used in the beginning of this review. But as I
titled in another review : &#x22;many elements of greatness don&#x27;t
necessarily make a great film&#x22;. I started to question myself. It&#x27;s a
film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real
escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn&#x27;t those dreams look
a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the
fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the
Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really
care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care
for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many
interrogation marks leading me to the &#x22;Limbo&#x22; review ...<br /><br />REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />&#x22;Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic
when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I
realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could&#x27;ve been
handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase
scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more
beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a
cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your
breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for
this one, but I think it&#x27;s time to retract myself and admit my judgment
mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik&#x27;s cube, but I guess I
forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change
my mind ? ... I don&#x27;t know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing
views, using this mind &#x22;Inception&#x22; tried to twist ... A very creative
film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but
beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only
the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance&#x22; 6/10<br /><br />Yep, the rating also fell through 4 &#x22;layers&#x22; ... what a painful
awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn&#x27;t feel anything
negative about it ... and one thing for sure, &#x22;Inception&#x22; has the
weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time,
that&#x27;s why I understand its popularity. It&#x27;s like my mind had already
accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it
relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an
&#x22;Inception&#x22; called Marketing?
