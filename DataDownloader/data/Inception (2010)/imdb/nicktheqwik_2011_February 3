I am going to make this as simple as possible regarding this movie
without any spoilers. This movie is packed full of absolutely
breathtaking scenery. The acting and character synopsis are in-depth
and very heartfelt. The story is impeccably written, (but one should
expect this from Christopher Nolan). The actors and actresses were very
well chosen for this particular story. It is very hard to dislike this
movie especially if you were a fan of Vanilla Sky, The Cell, and the
like, you will be shocked by how truly good this movie is. Inception is
listed on this website as the top rated movie of 2010 and I finally
understand why. It is truly a shame if you missed this in theaters. I
can say with no hesitation whatsoever that this is one of the best
movies I have ever seen, if not the best. Must see!!
