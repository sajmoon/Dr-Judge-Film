I've seen this movies a number of times. It was really good. Great effects,
great music, great story, and REALLY great comedy. I'm only 16, so that's
probably why I'm saying all that. Though I do believe that the movie was a
bit underrated. They could have at least made it &lt;M&gt;. Not &lt;PG&gt;.
It was a brilliant job by Chris Rock in that movie. He was really good at
that character. He portrayed that kind of a character so well, that I
thought he really was a gay. :)
Plus, OOLALA for Milla Jovovich. She was dead sexy in this. Wait, She is
dead sexy full stop. Excellent work by her also. Plain and simple...Great
Movie. I recommend it to anyone after a great deel of laughter.
My verdict : 9/10
