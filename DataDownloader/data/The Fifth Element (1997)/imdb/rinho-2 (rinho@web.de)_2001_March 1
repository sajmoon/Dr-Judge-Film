I liked the fifth element, because it is a good and exciting action movie.
It is very funny in parts, especially the crazy radio moderator Roby Rhods (
Chris Tucker ) has many jokes. I do like Bruce Willis and those
action-blockbusters, and this made no exception. There are better
sci-fi-action movies, definitely. But this is a good one. I recommend The
Fifth Element to sci-fi-action fans. I would put this movie in the same
category with &#132;Independence Day&quot; or &#132;Men in Black&quot;.<br /><br />Good points : action, comedy, Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker, special
effects<br /><br />Bad points : Milla Jovovich, style<br /><br />All in all, I rated The Fifth Element 8/10 and it is my number 111 movie (
outta 700 about ). <br /><br />If you have any questions, fell free to ask them. <br /><br />CU; Rinho. Bsss!
