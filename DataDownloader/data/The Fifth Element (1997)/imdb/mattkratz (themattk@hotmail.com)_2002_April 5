This wild movie, set in the future, was very well done. I loved the special
effects and the interactions between Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich's
characters, as Willis tries to protect Milla from evil forces and unite her
with the other four elements that will save the world altogether. I love
it!<br /><br />*** out of ****
