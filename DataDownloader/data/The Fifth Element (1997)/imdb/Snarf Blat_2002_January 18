I have seen The Fifth Element like ten times.
It's funny and exiting as well as cool,
and with Bruce Willis in the main role you can't go wrong.
If you like Action Comedy's mixed with Sci-fi,
this one is a Must Own.
The plot is in the future Bruce Willis plays Corben Dallas,
a Future Taxi Driver.
Ok I'm not going to tell the whole story then it's no point of<br /><br />seeing the movie, anyway I'll give it 11/10.
