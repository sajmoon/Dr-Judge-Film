2004_July 28 
I&#39;ve seen The Fifth Element several times now, at least four or five,
and I still can&#39;t say what it is find strangely appealing about it; I
just can&#39;t bring myself to say that it&#39;s bad, though I don&#39;t consider
it a spectacular(or even mediocre) achievement in cinema. The film is
carried by an insurmountable amount of mix-ups between the various
characters, and almost nothing else, which can be considered a strong
argument both for and against the movie&#39;s quality; for, since it&#39;s
somewhat of an achievement, against, since it should(arguably) be a
more worthwhile line of situations that keep a movie going. The
characters are almost all clich&eacute;s, especially the main characters, and
there is nothing in the movie to outweigh that; however, somehow, it
didn&#39;t matter too much, much like the plot being carried by mix-ups.
The dialog is no crowning achievement either; neither is the action. So
what is it exactly that draws people to this film, and works on so many
levels, and is liked by so many? Frankly, I have no idea. It just does.
Perhaps Luc Besson took a degree in psychology, and is somehow
affecting our subconscious with the film; who knows. The acting is
mostly good. Bruce Willis is good enough as Dallas, though his
character(and acting) is mostly derived from all of the other smart,
wise-cracking, well-trained and skilled characters he&#39;s played in the
past. The science fiction elements of the film are sometimes
spectacular, sometimes a little weird, but mostly entirely
unbelievable; and I&#39;m almost certain that&#39;s how Besson wanted it. What
carries the film is the humor in it; every single scene has some humor
in it, and it overshadows everything else. This is mostly a good thing,
though, as it works, most of the time. The timing and gags are great,
not tired, worn out, or forced, as they are with plenty of Hollywood
productions. I thoroughly enjoyed the cross-cutting segments of the
film, they were some of the best parts of the film, and delivered some
of the best laughs. One thing that thoroughly annoyed me, was Chris
Tucker&#39;s character; he was constantly irritating, and obviously(like
many of the other main characters) he was mainly there to contribute to
the mix-ups and the humor. I would&#39;ve liked the film more, had there
been something more...what&#39;s the word... &quot;Hollywood&quot;, I guess. It&#39;s
just annoying when there aren&#39;t really any characters that we truly
care about, and just about all of the main characters mainly are there
to make us laugh. All in all, an oddly appealing film, but too many
shortcomings and distractions to be entirely enjoyable. I recommend
this to... hmmm... that&#39;s a tough one; I can&#39;t really say who&#39;ll enjoy
the film, actually. I suppose fans of Besson and his earlier work might
enjoy it, but pretty much everybody should give it a try. It&#39;s hard to
tell who&#39;ll like it and who won&#39;t. 7/10
