1999_August 16 

From the director Luc Besson, The Fifth Element was one of the &quot;coolest&quot;
movie made this year.  The special effects were probably not the most
amazing, but that's not all in this movie.  The colors, the complementry
colors(blue/yellow, orange/red), look terrific.  The music by Eric Serra
was
also exciting, they fit the plot so well... listen to the part where
Leeloo
asks for Korben to drive on the cab, and the part before she jumped right
off...  the music made the scence so much more intense!
Watch the movie not for the action, but watch it more like a comedy.  It
is
more like a comic strip!  Chris Tucker did his character so well too, rock
on!
