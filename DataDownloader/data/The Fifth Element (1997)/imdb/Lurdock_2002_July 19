I hate this movie with a passion. If there ever was a pretentious movie
about nothing, but which tried recklessly to cover up its lack of meaning
with overelaborate sets and costumes, this is it right here. If you can't
allow yourself to be swayed by none too subtle pressure (case in point: the
drooling over Milla Jovovich, transplanted from horny teenage viewers in
the
audience into the movie itself) to like the movie for its appearance,
watching this steaming pile of refuse is going to be torture. Luc Besson
should never be allowed to work in show business again.
