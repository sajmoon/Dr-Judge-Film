This movie is arguably the most compelling view of the future since Ridley
Scott's Blade Runner. I'd definitely have to rate it in my &quot;Top 10&quot; of all
Sci-Fi movies ever made.....<br /><br />Brilliant concept. Great performances by lead roles, and most importantly,
great supporting performances by nice &quot;character&quot; casting.<br /><br />The special effects were state of the art but did not detract from the
overall feel of the picture.  The costumes and set design did what good
movies in this genre do....they provide bits of our present and past
together with things we haven't seen yet, to create a beautiful
tapestry.<br /><br />
