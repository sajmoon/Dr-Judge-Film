Someone can think that maybe it's only a tale for a children
but I think that actors were very good (especially Mila -
she was 'perfect' :))
And I was very happy that 'love' was the 5th element.
It's very nice:) I know that it's not real 5th element
but idea was very good (especially when You watch the
film with a woman :)
