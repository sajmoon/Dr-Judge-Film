1999_September 2 
<br /><br />Oh so close Bruce, stylistically, the film is very good.  Gary Oldman and
Milla Jovovich do a good job (Jovovich's first real acting part, if you
discount the almost cameo nature of her apperance in Dazed and Confused).<br /><br />The film was expertly sabotaged however, he brought the film from action
to
farce with an almost SAS or NAVY S.E.A.L. quality to it, the man I'm
talking
about? Chris Tucker.  Not only his performance *so* bad I almost hit the
screen, that he destroys any tension the film took so long to build up.<br /><br />An honorable failure.<br /><br />P.S. Why did Leeloo start crying her eyes out at WAR? Surely she must've
gone through Bigotry, Genocide, Murder and Hanson to get
there?
