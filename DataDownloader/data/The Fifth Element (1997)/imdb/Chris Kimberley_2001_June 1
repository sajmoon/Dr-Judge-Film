this is what i wrote for my tv guide:<br /><br />THE FITH ELEMENT, jean-luc bessons visual masterpiece,
bruce willis is cool, gary oldman is a little eccentric,
ian holm is stoic, milla jovavich is crazy-sexy, tricky
pops up, lee evans is funny and chris tucker is flamin
brilliant, apart from all these great performances (a 		
lot of good british supporting actors too) the film 		
itself has a good story, amazing special effects it all
adds up to a stunningly good film that never loses its 
breakneck pace and leaves me feeling all moist
