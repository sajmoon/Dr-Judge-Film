This is a great big fat comic book of a movie with characters to match
(`Bruce Willis saves the World'). I watched it only because it was a slow
Sunday night on TV, and the small screen and commercial breaks didn't help.
But it has a cheeky charm, plenty of action, villainous villains (though the
biggest villain is an unseen force) flamboyant sets (Brooklyn circa 2300 may
be stolen from Fritz Lang's `Metropolis' but is nonetheless very
impressive.) You can empathise with the heroine, reconstructed from a few
cells, when she sees the city for the first time.<br /><br />I won't go into the logical inconsistencies in the plot; this is not a movie
with a plot that bears much analysis. The future presented is more of the
same, but worse, so that in 2300 people will still be going to Las Vegas
style resorts, except that they will be in outer space. This does make you
think why we bothered with space flight at all. Essentially this is a French
film but with two unusual factors; a big Hollywood star, Bruce Willis, and a
fairly big budget, $US90 million. (The film more than recovered its costs
but did better in non-US markets). Its also a very personal film with Luc
Bresson both directing and writing, and casting Mrs Bresson , the gorgeous
Milla Jovovich, as the heroine (she does fit the bill nicely, dyed red hair
and all).<br /><br />It is possible to trace almost every scene back to some earlier film or
series. Apart from `Metropolis' there's the Egyptian scenes with John
Bluthal and Luke Perry in the style of `Indiana Jones', the death star from
`Star Wars', the casino battle with overtones of `Casino Royale', the
snogging in the escape capsule reminiscent of James Bond &#150; you name it,
Bresson has taken it from somewhere. Not a great deal of acting is required
in these circumstances, though Ian Holm makes the most of his opportunities
as Vito the priest. Chris Tucker is appallingly over the top as DJ Ruby Rhod
and I fervently hoped one of the minor monsters would blast him, but to no
avail. Gary Oldman put in a ho-hum performance as the evil entrepreneur
(called `Zorg' for heaven's sake), but was labouring under the handicap of
being a villain without a motive. Why would he want the Earth to be blown
up? Had he insured it with some Intergalactic Lloyds?<br /><br />This kind of cultural `borrowing' is quite common in French movies &#150; all
those French film noir films with Hollywood ancestry for example -  but
usually the French contrive to put their own stamp on the finished product.
This film is such a jumble, and so vague in its intentions it is impossible
to regard it as more than a pastiche, though done with a certain amount of
sly humour and plenty of resources. I think Gaumont were very lucky to get
their money back.
