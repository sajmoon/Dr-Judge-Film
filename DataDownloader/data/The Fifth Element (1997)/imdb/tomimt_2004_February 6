I remember when I saw The Fifth Element first time when it came out as
video
and how dazzling experience it was and how different it were when compared
in other Sci-fi films.<br /><br />I found this movie again from DVD sales bin and bought it just from the
heck
of it and boy, was I amazed how well it still does work for me. I laughed
and enjoyed the action. The opera scene is just fantastic.<br /><br />In downsides some of the visual CGI effects have lost their edge, but in
the
other hand that does not matter, because the world itself in this movie
looks like plastic and toys.<br /><br />This movie can be recommended for all, who like nicely flowing<br /><br />Sci-fi/comedy action. 9/10
