This is a great movie. It isn't your typical same alien vs. human movie
where there is blood everywhere, and the humans win right before
they've thought it was the end. It is much more interesting. The story
has love vs. evil in a whole new way, and there's a lesson to be
learned through it.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't really care about the plot all that much. The
imagination and creativity is awesome! I love the colors and the ideas
they came up with, especially how the design of the city. The
futuristic clothing is cool too. The only thing I was disappointed in
was the enemy aliens. They looked a little too artificial.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the whole movie was the music. It went from
techno to opera to jazz, and to all over. I loved the music, partially
because they used Engima and Vangelis. Many people are like, &quot;what the
heck was that?&quot; when they hear the music, but it fits the movie
perfectly and leaves you with a feeling more than a theme. I like the
randomness of the music, it works well with the quirkiness of the
movie.
