When this movie got released in US, a TV crew made interviews at the end
of
the show (it was in a LA theater, if I remember well). I never forgot what
a
10-year old girl said : &quot;Dez nuthin in it. It's bowing.&quot; She was 10-years
old, so I presume she was not what you could call a sci-fi purist. But she
said the essential.<br /><br />Luc Besson knows how to film corridors, people walking through corridors
and, to a lesser degree, people fighting in corridors. But he can't write
a
decent story: he has a very conventional imagination, why is why there are
so many clich&eacute;s in his movies, and also why he has to copy from others.
Besides, all his movies become quickly outdated, and &quot;the fifth element&quot;
is
not an exception. Besson makes trendy movies which do not stand the test
of
time. Try watching again The great blue or La femme Nikita and you'll see<br /><br />what I mean. Too much style, no class.<br /><br />In France, Besson never gets any official award for his work, and he's
very
proud of it. He thinks that makes him a cursed artist. In my opinion, he's
just a tedious climber who spent too much time in Disneyworld (and thought
it was art). There's nothing more to say abouth this guy.
