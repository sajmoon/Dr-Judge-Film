The Fifth Element shows that a bond between comedy and serious dramatic
science fiction can work miracles, as can a marriage of action and
comedy (as shown by the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie &#39;True Lies&#39;). The
Fifth Element is witty, smooth and impressive all at the same time.<br /><br />The film&#39;s wide array of characters colour the science fiction
adventure with some stereotypes, but also some genuinely interesting
characters who turn the film into a comic-book type affair which is
only enhanced by the scenes of multiple events occurring
simultaneously.<br /><br />Despite the fact that costumes, sets and CGI work in a balanced union
the film still does suffer from an occasional rigidness in some of its
spliced editing, especially during the beginning. As the film goes on,
however, this works in the films favour.<br /><br />Luc Besson shows what comes of a standard sci-fi action-flick once you
add a hint of character and colour.
