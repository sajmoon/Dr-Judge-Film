Nothing else quite like it. You name it, it has it. This is the &quot;Lets
make a
deal&quot; of films. I'll give you $200 for a Big Bada Boom! The few deep
thinkers commenting on this film may be better served reading War and
Peace.
If you go to a movie for entertainment, this is the best movie you'll
ever
see. If they don't clear the theatre after your showing, you will
probably
stay and watch again. This is a very hard movie to describe. One
suggestion,
don't blink. I am giving this film a conservative 11 out of 10
points.
