1998_September 18 

I must admit, the first time I saw, &quot;The fifth element,&quot; I found it quite
odd, yet as I thought about it more and more, I started to realize how truly
unique it really is. Don't be discouraged by the first 20 minutes. You will
be utterly confused, and think it's even BEYOND sci-fi, but as the plot
thickens, you will be absorbed into the story. The movie, although primarily
science fiction, contains elements of comedy (Chris Tucker), and a lot of
action. Oh, and for the guys out there, my boyfriend reports that Milla
Jovovich is the hottest of the hots (She is, after all, the &quot;Perfect Being!&quot;
Happy watching, This movie ROCKS!  :)
