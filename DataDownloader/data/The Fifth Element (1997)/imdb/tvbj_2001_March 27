I am truly sorry...yes, very sorry to all the fans of 'Star Treck', Star
Wars' and any other sci-fi movie ever made. 'The Fifth Element' is truly
an
excellent film, or rather, a terrific combination of action and
comedy...just like the perfect combination of stir-fry and beef. So
tasty,
yet so simple.<br /><br />Truly an exquisite film, 'The Fifth Element' takes place 300 years from
1914, when ancient inscriptions from a large Egyptian tomb were
discovered.
Basically, there are five elements which protect 'life' from all sources
of
evil. Put simply, it is the most powerful energy force in the universe.
Made
from fire, earth, wind and water, they all suside from the fifth element
(hence the title of the film), which takes form of a powerful warrior.
300
years later, the four sources are stolen and it is up to an unlikely
candidate (Bruce Willis) to take up the job of saving the world from a
powerful menace.<br /><br />Despite the large array of talented cast members (Bruce Willis, Mila
Jovovich, etc), Chris Tucker (acting as the funny Ruby Rohd) clearly
outshines the rest of the cast...performance, comedy, everything. In
fact,
his performance in this film is clearly the best he's ever given!
Amazing! I
highly recommend those craving for the unusual mix of sci-fi/action and
comedy, 'The Fifth Element' is a definate &quot;must see&quot;. Also, note that
this
is SPE's (Sony Pictures Entertainment) first go at the sci-fi film
section.
And the result is a terrific film on Sony/Columbia's first try. Do go and
see the film...definately an A grade standard.
