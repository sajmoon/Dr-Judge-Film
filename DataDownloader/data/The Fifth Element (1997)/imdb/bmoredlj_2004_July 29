There's never going to be a movie EVERyONE likes, but I'm writing this
review b/c when I first saw this film - 4 yrs after it was released - I
thought it was one of the most visually appealing and
originally-executed sci-fi thrillers I'd ever seen. <br /><br />I'm an art student, so I really appreciated the over-the-top
audio-visual smorgasboard that Besson does best. A lot of love went
into this film. His vision of the future closely resembles mine---lots
of chaos, but somehow things get done anyway. And that future is
portrayed exactly as if we had just been suddenly thrown into it (like
jovovich's character): dizzyingly colorful and chaotic, but filled with
wonder and awe too. One couldn't ask for a better cast, especially Ian
Holm and Gary Oldman. Eric Serra's ethereal score is the ideal match
for the mood of the film.<br /><br />A couple of negatives, like police brutality and corporate megalomania,
the shootup scenes went a little long, and the ending was kinda corny,
but nothing that ruins the film as a whole. Besson's 5th El. has its
own unique, sometimes ludicrous energy, which sets its apart from any
other films. I thought this was a truly enjoyable movie.
