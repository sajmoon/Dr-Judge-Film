Yes I know it was over the top and everyone seems to find something they
don't like about it but for me the attraction was that everything was over
the top, and it works!!
The costumes and sets were superb. The acting was great, especially Bruce
in
one of his most understated roles while all around him were
OTT.
And what can you say about Chris Tucker?
Love him or hate him this was a master stroke and picked the film up when
it
could have slowed in the middle.
Altogether a masterpiece which I gave 10.
