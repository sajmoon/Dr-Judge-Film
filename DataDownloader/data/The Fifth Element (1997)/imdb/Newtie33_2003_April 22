2003_April 22 

I usually go into most movies with an open mind but I left this movie
feeling like I had been robbed of two hours of my life.  I kept thinking
to
myself that this was a 'joke' movie that no one was supposed to take
seriously but obviously some people did.  I often catch myself watching
movies to completion no matter how bad they are but this one was a test.
Chris Tucker turned in a great performance as always and although this
movie
did have some great acting, the plot was extremely weak.  The acting will
give it some merit but not enough to make it a watchable movie.
5/10
