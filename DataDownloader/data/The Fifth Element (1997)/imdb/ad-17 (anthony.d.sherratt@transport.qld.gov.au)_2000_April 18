A wonderful sci fi romp (a word not usually associated with the sci fi genre
but not at all a bad thing). It's a playful film with the obligatory big
guns, cute girl, cool aliens, amazing special effects and sweeping
landscapes.<br /><br />Throw in a very cool villian (Gary Oldman is simply one of the best bad guys
there is) and outrageous costumes and you have The Fifth Element.<br /><br />This light-headed movie centres around the existence of a new element we
were previously unaware of. So far so good - that's a reasonably strong
starting point for a plot. Then we discover this new (fifth) element is a
gorgeous babe and we no longer care about the merits of the script. Milla
Jovavich does a great acting job as a confused and english-challenged
alie... er... element. Her performances have been criticised and I think
some critics have brought along their previous opinions as baggage. Here she
was great and not just because she
exudes cute innocence and sex appeal (which she did with style). The Loriel
girl definitely proved she's worth it.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does the diehard thing again. Aliens get shot, Leloo discovers
humanity isn't all roses, things blow up, heroes fallin love. What else do
you want?
