For pure wacky comedy action, look no further than &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.
Although I usually don't like Bruce Willis, he's really cool in this
movie, as 23rd century cab driver Korben Dallas trying to save the
world with super-being Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). But overall, this
movie's all about one-liners (you'll know 'em when you hear 'em). AND
CHRIS TUCKER IS SO DAMN FUNNY!!!!!!!!! I gotta wonder how someone could
have so much energy. This is one truly great sci-fi comedy. I'll spend
my whole life thinking about it and laughing.<br /><br />As it is, while I was in St. Petersburg, Russia, last semester, I saw a
spoof of this movie on the cartoon &quot;Magazinchik Bo&quot;.
