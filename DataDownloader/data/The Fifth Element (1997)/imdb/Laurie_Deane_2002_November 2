2002_November 2 

I'll start by making it clear that I am not recommending this film as an
oscar-deserving classic, but instead as an enjoyable two hours-or-so of
cinema. Bruce Willis delivers a performance akin to so many of those he is
typecast in. Meaning that he runs around shouting a lot in a vest and
sweats. Milla Jovovich is interesting and captivating as Leeloo and one of
the film's best scene's occurs when she engages in a well coreographed
fight
scene to the weird background music of Sarah Brightman's alien diva.<br /><br />The film's best creation however, is Chris Tucker's DJ Ruby Rhod, a
fast-talking DJ-cum-TV host of the future who speaks in the films unique
futuristic coloquialisms whilst young girls scream around him. Bruce
Willis
gets to play off of this character a lot in the film, and if you are
thinking that a fast-talking DJ-cum-TV host played by Chris Tucker sounds
as
good a reason as any for NOT watching a movie, I can assure you that you
will be pleasantly surprised. The films dialogue is top-notch, I seriously
recommend that you see this film at least once.
DJ Ruby Rhod: Quiver ladies, quiver!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DJ Ruby Rhod: What was that honey? It was bad! It had no fire, no energy,
no
nothing! So tomorrow from 5 to 7 will you PLEASE act like you have more
than
a two word vocabulary! It must be green!
Korben Dallas: Can I talk to you for a second?
[Throws Ruby up against a wall]
Korben Dallas: I didn't come here to play poom-bow on the radio. So
tomorrow
from 5 to 7 your gonna give yourself a hand, green?
DJ Ruby Rhod: Supergreen.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DJ Ruby Rhod: We'll find out everything there is to know about the D man:
his dreams, his desires, his most intimates of intimates, and from what
I'm
looking at, &quot;intimate&quot; is the stud muffin's middle name! So tell me my
man,
are you nervous in the service?
Korben Dallas: Mmm... not really.
