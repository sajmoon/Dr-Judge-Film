Watching `The Fifth Element' made me fall in love with Bruce Willis, Milla
Jovovich, and color.  The cast, costumes, sets, score, effects, and
concepts
are (eye) candy too beautiful to eat.  Some would find such a situation
`too
sweet,' but I consider it fun, especially because I don't believe that
plot
was sacrificed for the visual experience.  Instead, I maintain that there
is
a plot, but also posit that looking to `The Fifth Element' for plot is
missing the point.  The film rejoices in itself.  Within the hypercolorful
universe of the film, Willis is simultaneously *funny,* sexy, and lethal,
and Jovovich is *cute,* sexy, and lethal.  Take the film too seriously and
you'll miss that they (especially Willis) are not.  After my recent
umpteenth viewing of the film, I realized that I also love it for its
editing and framing, which add to the fun comic book feel already inspired
by the color and plot, but which I was only recently able to pin down with
words.  Watch `The Fifth Element' for plot and you may be disappointed,
but
watch it with your eyes and your heart, and you will understand why it is
great.
