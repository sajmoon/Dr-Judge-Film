1999_April 26 

I recently voted this film my &quot;Millennium movie&quot; after much deliberation and
this is why.  Never before have I seen such a vibrant, colourful Science
Fiction film that I can watch time after time with no less
interest.<br /><br />For a start, the costumes and sets are alive with colour - something that is
a startling contrast to the usual dark, almost sinister look of most Science
Fiction films.  From the outlandish costumes to the well thought out alien
creatures the visuals ooze style.<br /><br />The story, although sometimes a little shallow, is in itself a great good
versus evil battle without giving you the feeling that you've seen it
somewhere before.<br /><br />Bruce Willis carries his usual tough guy, action-man character into the film
without once looking out of place - this was the one actor I thought could
have ruined the feel of the movie.  Outstanding performances from Gary
Oldman and Chris Tucker, along with some superb bit part appearances from
the likes of Tricky and Lee Evans are just a few of the many that make up a
superb cast.<br /><br />To me, this film will become a timeless classic - certainly one I will be
watching way into the next millennium.
