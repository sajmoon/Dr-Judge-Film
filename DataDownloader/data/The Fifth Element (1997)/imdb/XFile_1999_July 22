1999_July 22 

Lets first remember for a second, if you will, the premise behind the
flick.
A cab driver, through a set of fortuituos circumstances, becomes entrusted
with the fate of the earth some time in the distant future. Gee...hopefully
no one drifts too far off the reality path with this one eh? Come on...the
movies a sci-fi flick....realism and things making sense are not supposed
to
abound. Taken for what it is this is a fun flick. It moves, never really
drags, has some yucks..some minor league gore..some eye candy....all fairly
well spread out over it's entirety. On the one to ten scale I'll toss in a
7.5
