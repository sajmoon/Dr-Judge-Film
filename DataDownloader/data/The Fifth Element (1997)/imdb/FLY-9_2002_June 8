This movie was OK in terms of the visuals, but with a lot of tasteless
cheesy entertainment elements. First off, why put in Chris Tucker?? His
acting is just so disgusting with the radio D.J. character and so tasteless,
not matching with the style of the whole movie at all.<br /><br />The best scene is probably the Diva Opera, which is kinda creative and
visually stunning, but then again, a lot of the visual &quot;ideas&quot; was from a 
lot of Japanese animes. Poor Japanese anime designers/artiest would never
get credits for these as their animes were NEVER been able to make it to
international market (political/cultural reasons? Geez). Anyway, it's an OK
and entertaining movie, but again, it could have reached a higher level of
achievement if it was created a bit more &quot;realistic&quot; and not just with a lot
of visual effects.
