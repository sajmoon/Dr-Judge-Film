When this movie first came out, it was promoted as &quot;The Next Star Wars&quot; or
&quot;The Star Wars for the 90's&quot;.  There are some similarities.  It is Science
Fiction, but the characters also are fighting a more mystical &quot;Evil&quot;.
There
is also a feeling of Unchangeable Destiny as nothing can stop the main
characters from meeting each other and their goals.<br /><br />Aside from that, the comparisons can stop.  Star Wars is great in its own
right, but so is the Fifth Element.  If they were musical styles, Star Wars
is classical, and Fifth Element is Hip-hop/Dance Mix.<br /><br />The Fifth Element is just stunning.  A visual treat that really has no true
comparison or match.  Forget about comparing to other Science Fiction
movies.  Forget about comparing to other Luc Besson movies.  Just sit back
and enjoy the ride.
