The fifth element is a very entertaining film.It starts out boring,but than
it gets really good.This movie really captures the aspect of an action movie
and a comedy,it has great shooting sequences,some okay comedy material,and
it has great acting.Fifth Element is a good movie for action fans and is
guarenteed to be enjoyable.Has great acting,and a great deal of
entertaiment.I give it a 9 out of 10.I would have given it a ten but a point
got knocked off because it started out really boring.
