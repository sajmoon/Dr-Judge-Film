2000_September 3 

The movie not only treats us to stunning visuals (not only thanks to JP
Gaultier's great costumes, but the whole sets and scenery as well), but the
editing job (something too rarely regarded, IMHO) is also a work of art!
Scenes such as the bomb going off on the cruise ship with cuts as the
countdown is - well, counting down, I suppose... ;] - with the count
providing a thread through several scenes are just one example of how all of
it wonderfully fits one piece into another to complete the puzzle.<br /><br />Got it on DVD and will be watching it over and over again!
