1999_February 5 

Sorry for Luc Besson. A story like this, based on a banal moral, could have
been saved by humor (like Armageddon, another movie about Bruce Willis
saving the world) or good love story (like Nikita or Leon) or
references/making fun of something else (I did not see any). Alas. Humor is
not Luc's strongest point; here it is like the films made in
thirties-sixties - the jokes that won't entertain even a child nowadays. The
love story is probably the Besson's worst one. And calling it a wonderful
parody is just looking for an excuse for the good people who made it.
