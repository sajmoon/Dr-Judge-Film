1999_August 4 

Though I will admit that I'm not much of a fan of the whole
science-fiction
genre, I say this is one of the best movies at the video store right now.
If you haven't seen it, rent it soon (and on DVD if possible).  Director
Besson takes an okay idea and some relatively unexperienced
actors/actresses
(Johovich and Tucker) and creates a masterpiece.  Definite
ten.
