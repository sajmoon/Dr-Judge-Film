This movie was both entertaining, comedic and action filled. Bruce
Willis does it again in film. He takes a character and brings it to
life like only a true actor could. He gives you that comedic side that
he has done in the past. But he also brings out what he is known for
and that is his action kick butt side. His role was awesome. Milla
Jovovich...Wow. She looked....Wow. Then of course you got Gary Oldman
who has been a great actor in what ever movie he does. To have that
kind of star power in a movie and make it work is hard to do. Then you
got the comedy of Chris Tucker. He added that other side of humor that
fitted nicely in this film. It was shot well. The script was good. The
plot made sense. The movie was great.
