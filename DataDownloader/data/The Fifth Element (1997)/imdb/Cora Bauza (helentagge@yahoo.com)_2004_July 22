I'm not sure why, but I have loved this film since the first time I saw
it. It is perfect in it's weirdness. All of the elements (pardon the
play) work beautifully to make this a truly believable story. I would
pay to see Bruce Willis read the phone book, in part because of his
thorough believability. On the program &quot;D-V-D on TV&quot;, one of the hosts
said that he is the perfect anti-Rambo and that is so true. He can play
a guy who blows the doors off of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and a nerd who is more
scared of his &quot;dead&quot; wife than he is of how mediocre he's become, and a
psychiatrist who counsels disturbed children and you believe him in
each of the roles.<br /><br /> From the Gaultier clothes to the fine Shakespearean actors to the
force that is Chris Tucker to the wonderful &quot;language&quot; spoken by
Leeloo, it's a great thoroughly entertaining funny ride.<br /><br />I loved it.
