The best thing about The Fifth Element is Milla Jovovich speaking the
Divine Language. With her Eastern European background, she actually
manages to make it sound like a real language, unlike some Santa Monica
bimbo who got a C in Spanish and couldn&#39;t find Europe on a map. This
movie is pure nonsense and is almost certainly nothing like what life
will really be like 250 years from now, but it has bright, Life Saver
candy colors and lots of action. It has some imaginative special
effects and futuristic devices that someone actually put some thought
into. Several human races and a few alien ones are represented on the
screen, rather than a uniform cast of bland Americans. What is most
entertaining is its vision of the far future: Gaudy, raucous, colorful,
and anarchic. The look of the film borrows a bit from the Italian
cinema, the Sixties, Blade Runner, and Terry Gilliam&#39;s &quot;Brazil,&quot;
although it is not as inspired as any of its sources. This is in stark
contrast to the dour, Germanic futures we saw in sci-fi flicks from the
Fifties through the Seventies and that only started to change with Star
Wars, which of course was not in the future but in the futuristic past.
Bruce Willis uses his quiet persona to great effect in this film; he is
the still point around which all the noisy action revolves; as Korben
Dallas, he is carried along by the full-tilt action until the climactic
last act, when he finally takes charge. Ian Holm is his usual great
self as the nervous wreck of a priest. Gary Oldman as Zorg, the
villain, is not evil, just obnoxious.
