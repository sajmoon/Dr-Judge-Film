1999_February 27 

One of the best films ever. Combining great picture, direction music,
costumography, scenography, acting. Everything is perfect in this film, it's
absolutely great, especially Jean Paul Gaultier's designs, Serra's music and
Oldman's acting. There are few scenes that are simply amazing and should be
marked with 10 in the movie history. The story is interesting but the whole
atmosphere of the 5th element is what makes it FANTASTIC! All the best to
Chris from Amsterdam, who wrote a great review for THE FIFTH
ELEMENT.
