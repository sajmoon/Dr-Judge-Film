2002_March 3 

I find this movie to be one of the best I've seen because of its
originality.  Nothing about the visual effects and storyline is like any
other movie I've seen.  I own the DVD and have watched it many, many
times,
seeing something new each time.  I can understand that this movie would
not
be for everyone, some people have to have things spelled out very plainly
and don't like having to WATCH a movie to follow the events. While this
movie does demand your attention, anyone willing to put in a little extra
effort will be greatly awarded with a very funny, action filled, visually
stunning, awesomely sound tracked, entertainment experience.<br /><br />10/10
