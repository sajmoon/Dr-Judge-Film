If you, like myself, are on of those people who practically despise sci-fi
because of its technical geekiness, then you'll love this, because its
sci-fi with colourful funkiness!!<br /><br />The story is your average save-the-world romp, but its the amazing locations
and oddball characters that stand out.  The hero, played by Bruce Willis, is
your typical hard-guy, but in true Bruce fashion, he wears a vest!  But this
time its orange and all futuristic!<br /><br />The mysterious lead woman, played by Milla Jovovich, has the brightest
orange hair ever, and wears a sexy outfit.  The president of the United
States is African American, played by the brilliant Tiny Lister, the bad guy
looks like a toy and is suitably played with pantomime wickedness by Gary
Oldman, and Chris Tucker plays a camp space-DJ!<br /><br />The direction is sharp and stylish and the overall look is great on the
eyes.  This has to be one of the best sci-fi's purely because it is funny,
colourful and different.
