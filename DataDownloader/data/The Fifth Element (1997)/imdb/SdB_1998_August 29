Finally! No more simple Men-in-black and Independence Day science-fiction.
This movie has everything your fantasy has ever imagined outerspace. The
aliens are very convincing and alive. The colors, machinery and sights are
very creative and the clothing by Jean Paul Gaultier is extraordinary. This
movie is a pleasure for the eye and very un-american.
Bruce Willis is very pleasantly cliche without overdoing. This image of the
future is very cynical and taken from great science-fiction books. Luc
Besson has done his homework. My compliments. A fantastic movie!
