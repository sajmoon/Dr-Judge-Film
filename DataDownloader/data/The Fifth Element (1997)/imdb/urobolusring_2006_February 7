Most critics approached the Fifth Element unable to understand exactly
what the movie was trying to do. The Fifth Element is not the
second-coming of Star Wars or something like Serenity, Blade Runner,
etc.<br /><br />The Fifth Element instead is a tongue-in-cheek celebration of classic
comic book science fiction that is done with class and finesse. The
plot, the dialogue, the visuals, everything is done in a zany vein of
both humor an style. The movie is equally adept at poking fun at the
conventions of its subject matter while simultaneously appreciating it
with the love of a 10-year old engrossed in a thrilling science fiction
tale.<br /><br />In terms of visuals, Besson's flourishes are stunning and nigh-perfect
in their matching the parodic/celebratory tone of the movie. The flashy
colors, special effects, wonderfully performed action sequences,
strange, indescribable moments of sheer wonder and overall bombast all
combine well and fit the plot and dialogue like a glove.<br /><br />Most of all, the movie is just plain fun. The pacing is quick but not
so quick as to make everything completely incoherent. The plot can be
convoluded but once again this is a misunderstood element--the
convolutions of the story are a deliberate play on the convolutions of
classical sci-fi comic books and literature. Some might want to dispute
me there, saying I'm giving the film too much credit, but Besson is not
an idiotic director, and he didn't take transcribe the plot of a story
he wrote in 10th grade just because he thought it would be a
complicated tale of human triumph; he did it to be parodic, while never
losing sight of the fun and color that makes sci-fi as enjoyable as it
is.<br /><br />People will always say that 'The Fifth Element' is guilty of style over
substance. I contend that the substance is there, it's merely that it
is not the substance that those looking for the next uber-serious
'Blade Runner' want to praise. It is a substance as pulpy as can be,
but like 'Pulp Fiction' it raises the 'low' art of such substance to
the level of 'high' art. It's only problem is that most critics today
aren't willing to accept this &quot;low-art-made-high&quot; and will discard any
movie that embraces it as 'empty-headed.' But, then again, they don't
get called 'snooty' for nothing.
