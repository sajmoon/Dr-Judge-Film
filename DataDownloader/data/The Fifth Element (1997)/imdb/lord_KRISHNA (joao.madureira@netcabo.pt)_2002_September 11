I personally think this movie is one the great films of the last decade.
It
is the template by which &quot;futuristic&quot; films (not really sci-fi) should
guide
themselves; it is a good exercise in extrapolating the current situation
and
imagining a future out of it, full of nice little details such as the
MacDonald's in the sky.<br /><br />It is beautifully shot, and showcases the absolute mastery of the visual
effects department (let's not forget this is one of most important aspects
for such kind of picture), and other details like Donizetti's music during
the extravagant opera scene and the costumes designed by Jean-Paul
Gaultier
add to a very unique and appealing image.<br /><br />The storyline, though nothing great, is quite accomplished
nevertheless.<br /><br />Finally, let's not forget the lovely Milla Jovovich is present, and for
her
I'm sure even the most hardened of critics will change his
mind....
