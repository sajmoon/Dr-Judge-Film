I think that this movie is ideal for people with very specific aesthetic
values. It isn't a great movie: It has some plot issues, and of course the
science parts are totally bogus. But once you get past these problems, this
is a movie which just keeps giving a great experience. The sets, lighting
and wardrobe are all amazing. The whole movie has the look of one of those
high-culture fashion shows. Add in tons of great Bruce-Willis-Style action,
and Chris Tucker's hilarious performance, and you have a real winner. While
this is not one of the best movies in my collection, it is the most viewed
movie. Aside from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes
Back,&quot; this is the only movie that I am always excited to see. This is,
however, a bit of a departure for Luc Besson, so if your favorite movies
are
&quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and &quot;Leon: The Professional,&quot; you may go either way on
this one.
