Be patient during the opening sequences - the movie starts slowly and
my kids were not slow to start moaning about the lack of pace. But once
the story began to unfold (and it&#39;s not clear for a while what the
story is) they were hooked.<br /><br />There are plenty of surprises in the movie. The plot is not very
complicated, but odd characters keep popping up to bring variety.<br /><br />The special effects are starting to look dated, but that&#39;s not
surprising given the age of the movie.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy. Take it too seriously and you will be disappointed.
Accept the quirks as part of its charm.
