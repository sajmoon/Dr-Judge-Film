I loved The Fifth Element.... it has everything - action, comedy, good
F/X, and some cool actors.<br /><br />This is what movies should be like... of course I respect Schindler&#x27;s
List and Brokeback mountain and all that but movies should be fun and
entertaining that is what The Fifth ELement is - a fun ride from
beginning to end.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is gorgeous and if you want to see her at her Sci Fi
chick best then watch this rather than Resident Evil. I have always
been a fan of Bruce Willis no matter how many times he repeats his John
Mclane persona. Ian Holm was funny, Gary Oldman was over the top but in
the right amount. Usually the bad guy has a British Accent but this
time it was American. And of course Chris Rock does what he does best
... being a motormouth.<br /><br />Jean Paul Gautier designed some wacky costumes... a bit campy but still
very creative. Excellent background score as well culminating in the
Opera performance from the Diva... a true cinematic experience when you
watch the movie at a multiplex screen.<br /><br />I have seen this movie at least 15 times and usually tend to watch it
when it comes on cable to catch my favourite bits.<br /><br />Not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea but i like it.
