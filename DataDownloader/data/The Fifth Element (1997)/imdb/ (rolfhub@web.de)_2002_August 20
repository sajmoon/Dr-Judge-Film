Well, I really liked the movie, the plot is a bit too thin and foreseeable
most of the time, but you can find many funny little ideas troughout the
whole film, that make you laugh or think. The cast is great, too, and, of
course, the FX crew had quite some work put into this, which really pays
out, so if you don't mind the plot beeing a bit thin, watch it, I think
you'll like it (as I did).
