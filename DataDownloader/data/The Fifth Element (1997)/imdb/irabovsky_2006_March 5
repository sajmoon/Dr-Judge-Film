This is my favourite sci-fi action film. Granted, I don't think I can
call the &quot;Back to the future&quot; series action films, but regardless its
sci-fi. 5th Element, for lack of a better word, just owns. Bruce Willis
does an impressive performance. And that red-headed girl (Don't
remember her name at this second) is just gorgeous! At times, I found
Chris Tucker to be annoying.<br /><br />Anyways, the movie gives you everything you've ever wanted in a sci-fi
flick.<br /><br />&quot;Sir, are you designated as human?&quot; &quot;No, Sir, I am a meat popsicle&quot;
Great lines. =)
