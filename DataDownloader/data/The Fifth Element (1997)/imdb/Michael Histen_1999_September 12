There's something about this movie that just leaves you in awe.  The bright
coloring, exquisite clothing, and high energy are just overwhelming.  If
you
try to watch this movie with any expectation of realism or believability,
then you're missing the point.  This movie is about extravagance,
fascination, and euphoria.  Giving a long commentary won't describe it
well,
it's just incredible fun.
