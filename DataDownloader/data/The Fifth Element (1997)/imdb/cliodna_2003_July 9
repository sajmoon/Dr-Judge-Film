This is an excellent movie, moving along at an excellent pace and
entertaining you every step of the way. The dialouge and acting are superb.
It might not be Oscar material. If you are looking for something serious and
thought provoking - grow up, and have some fun! The Fifth Element is packed
with action and dare I say, ridiculously fun outfits. A must see film for
the family (though, perhaps not the young children.)
