1998_September 12 

Ok, I like ALL sci fi.  I think there are some very simple reasons I
liked 5th element.  First off, I don't beleive that a single shot was held
for more than 30 second, keeping with the average Sci Fi fan's attention
span.  
I like Bruce Willis, and I like shooter flicks.  This movie was both. 
While the plot wasn't the best, you have to keep in mind that any movie isn
't going to have a plot worthy of a good Sci Fi novel, simply because 2-3
hours isn't enough time to put a whole novel into.  
The FX were grand, and I think it was well cast.
