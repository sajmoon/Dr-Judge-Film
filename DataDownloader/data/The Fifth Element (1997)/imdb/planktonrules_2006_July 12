Okay, I must first point out that Chris Tucker in this film was like a
walking and talking migraine. I know to some extent that is EXACTLY
what the producers and director wanted, but he was so whiny and nasal I
wanted to see him hit by a laser! That&#39;s out of my system, so I can go
on with my review. This is perhaps the strangest sci-fi movie to come
out of Hollywood and starring a first-tier American actor (though the
director is French). I might have expected something this strange and
risky to come from an independent producer, but for the &quot;big boys&quot; to
finance such an odd film is quite &quot;odd&quot; in itself.<br /><br />Aside from Bruce Willis, whose character seems like just a guy taken
out of the 20th century, all other actors in the film seemed strange
and other-worldly. This was true for the female lead, Milla Jovovich,
who looks a lot like an 80s punk rocker but who speaks a strange
foreign language no one other than Willis can understand. But, this
strangeness was even more apparent by all the odd creatures that
inhabit the film--ranging from a blue-skinned woman with a very
odd-shaped head who sings in a sort of alien operatic style to Gary
Oldman&#39;s thugs who look a lot like,....nothing I have even dreamed of
before! The worlds, too, are very very strange and look nothing like
the Star Trek or Star Wars worlds--having their own unique look and
charm that shows that the film must have cost a ton to make and had a
strong commitment by the studio for its completion as the writers had
envisioned it.<br /><br />The plot is too difficult to adequately describe in the space I have
here. In fact, it would probably be best to just leave that all up to
you. Watch it if you are a lover of sci-fi or you are willing to see
something VERY unconventional. Otherwise, I doubt if you&#39;ll get a lot
out of this film, since it is certainly NOT derivative or like anything
you&#39;ve ever seen before (unless you are psychotic or have done some
MASSIVELY powerful drugs).
