One of my favorite movies of all time. Ravishing sets, gorgeous costumes
(Jean Paul Gaultier), beautiful cinematography (Thierry Arbogast), grandiose
soundtrack (Eric Serra), and an excellent story. Acting was, umm... more
than sufficient.<br /><br />The story has been outlined elsewhere, but a synopsis of it would be &quot;world
is gonna' end, gotta' save it, fantastic odds to be overcome...and fall in
love&quot;.<br /><br />The visuals, story, and pacing in this movie are timeless, just like 1979's
&quot;Alien&quot;, and 1982's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (both Ridley Scott) -in that the level of
quality in the cinematography and editing allows them to be comparable to
the best of movies produced today. It's not just about digital FX, it's
about art.<br /><br />There isn't a moment where you feel the urge to fast forward past the
&quot;boring parts&quot; as the pacing is quite solid. Each shot is beautifully
composed and filmed, as there are no &quot;junk&quot;  or &quot;filler&quot; shots to be found
in this film.<br /><br />The score is excellent, Eric Serra is a master of orchestration, on par with
Elfman, albeit completely different styles.<br /><br />The story is quite fantastic -maybe even preposterous, I'll give you that,
but it is a sci-fi romantic comedy. I don't think it aspires to be more than
what it is, with the simple premise of good versus ultimate evil, that can
only be defeated by the strength of love.<br /><br />Although, if you are used to American films and could care less about beauty
in films, then don't bother watching this. If you have any care for film at
all, see this in one of its wide-screen versions -you are literally missing
half the film if you watch pan-and-scan (most movies).<br /><br />If you liked this movie at all and haven't yet seen &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; or
&quot;Leon&quot; (the butchered version of this is known as &quot;The Professional&quot; here in
the US), then rent them both (wide-screen, please).
