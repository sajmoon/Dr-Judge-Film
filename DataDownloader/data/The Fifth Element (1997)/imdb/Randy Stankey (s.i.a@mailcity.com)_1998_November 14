1998_November 14 

When I first saw the previews of the movie in the theatre, I thought it
would be lame.  The &quot;teaser&quot; was very vague and gave me the impression it
was going to be one of those &quot;Dark &amp; Evil&quot; movies that I hate.  (&quot;The Crow&quot;,
for instance.)  The regular &quot;theatrical&quot; trailer wasn't much better but it
got my interest up.<br /><br />The movie itself was good the first time I saw it but a little hard to
understand because of the way some parts were edited.  The intercut parts in
particular were hard to follow.
(The fight/concert scene for example)<br /><br />The next time I saw it, I thought those were the best scenes.<br /><br />The special effects are great.<br /><br />The social commentary about life in the future was rather entertaining.
(&quot;Put your hands in the yellow circles!&quot;)<br /><br />The soundtrack is great, especially when played in digital sound (Dolby Dig.
/ DTS) at high volume!<br /><br />The story is a little bit 'basic' (A mission to save the world)but I still
liked it.<br /><br />The characters were good in that they fit into the plot very well but some
people may find them &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;.<br /><br />It's probably because they don't &quot;get it&quot;.<br /><br />My rating system:<br /><br />* = Dumb -- Forget it.<br /><br />** = I would wait for it on HBO if I were you.<br /><br />*** = Go watch it in the theatre<br /><br />**** = GREAT! -- Go see it NOW!<br /><br />I GIVE THIS MOVIE A &quot;***1/2&quot;<br /><br />( I almost never give a &quot;****&quot;)
