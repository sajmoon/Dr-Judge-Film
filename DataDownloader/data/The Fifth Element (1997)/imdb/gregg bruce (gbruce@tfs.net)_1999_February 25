1999_February 25 

This movie is one of the best edited, best acted, facinating, funny,
dramatic, excellent special effects, cool storyline, great one liner's type
of adventure that my family and I can't get enough of.  It takes me away to
a different land where nothing else matters, total escape from the daily
drudges of life.  TRUE plain entertianment without (I think) trying to make
a point. Sound track is good too-- just music from the movie-- almost in
order-- seems somewhat strange, but mixed with the movie, it makes sense.
And who is Luke Besson??  Awesome job!! Bravo!!
