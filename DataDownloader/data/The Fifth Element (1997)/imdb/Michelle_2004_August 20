Like watching one egomaniac teenage boy's wet dream of life: you are
Bruce Willis, the only man in the universe who is not a quivering,
whimpering coward; naturally, you're the only one capable of saving a
futuristic world in which even the McDonalds employees have the
cleavage of porn stars; the only other guy in town who gets any chicks,
strangely enough, has stereotypically gay mannerisms; and you are
entitled to (as your prize for saving the world) the Perfect Woman: who
is gorgeous and sweet and has, literally, the innocence of a child. If
the movie passed itself off merely as a goofy comedy, this sexism
wouldn't bother me- however, the fusing of crude humor with attempted
seriousness about love and saving the world leaves a nasty taste in
your mouth.
