 Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman star in this action packed sci fi thriller
about a mysterious Fifth Element(milla jovovich) who drops to Earth and into
Willis' taxi.<br /><br /> The film is scripted well and contains plenty of laughs. Gary Oldman is
brilliant as the bad guy, whose conquest is to find the four elements.
Willis is excellent as Corben Dallas, a taxi driver who has the unlucky job
of saving the world.<br /><br /> Co stars include Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Luke Perry. Holm doesn't
exactly give a career best, but still manages to keep up with the other
leads. Tucker's annoying voice does well in Rush Hour and Jackie Brown, but
after ongoing screams, he gets intolerable.<br /><br /> The main flaw in The Fifth Element is the slowness. The ending is
brilliant, its the best bit in the whole film. Its the introduction that
takes the longest. The first ten minutes is the time to fast forward
through. Rating=3/5
