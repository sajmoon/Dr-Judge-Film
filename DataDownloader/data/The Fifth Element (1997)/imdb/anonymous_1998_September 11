1998_September 11 

This movie is one of the greatest scifi movies I've seen.  For first-time
watchers, it seems really odd.  After you watch it at least one more time,
the movie seems to get better.  It's pretty obvious that great time and
care was taken to make sure the movie had little or no continuity errors,
and making certain rediculous scenes were extremely realistic.  The
storyline could use a little help to make it flow a bit faster.  Overall,
the movie is well thought out and seems entertaining and logical, once you
get past some distracting oddities. For first-time viewers, my advice would
be to watch it without interruptions and listen closely.
