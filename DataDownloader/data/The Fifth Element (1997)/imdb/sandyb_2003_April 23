It's got a plot. It's got likable characters -- including the bad guys. It's
got cool F/X and groovy costumes. Most importantly, it's got a sense of
humour. What's not to like?<br /><br />Willis is in his element, and so is that supreme being Milla Jovovich. The
movie is chock full of entertaining supporting actors. Hey, Zorg (played
with aplomb by a giddy Gary Oldman) even has a point about the constructive
value of death and destruction.<br /><br />The sets are wonderful -- a future of excess population, traffic, noise, and
riotous colour. I think some of those kooky costumes will actually
materialize in the 23rd century...<br /><br />Go get the video. The movie's fun. And we all need that once in a while.<br /><br />
