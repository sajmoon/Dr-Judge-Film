The Fifth Element was...okay.  It had a good storyline and a strong
heroine
character, but it was too out of touch with reality.  A good sci-fi film
makes you wonder could this ever really happen?  The Fifth Element did not
do that.  For one, all of the bright colors and ridiculous outfits were
completely unbelievable, and I mean that negatively.  The storyline,
although it's been done a hundred times, suffered from the cartoony set
design.  How could I believe the world was coming to an end when
everything
looks like it came out of a Saturday morning kids program?  A dark,
brooding
set design would have been better.  The film does have one saving
grace-Mila
Jovovich.  Her character is interesting and fun because of her conflict;
she
was built as a weapon but was like a child.  Other than that, all of the
other performances, especially Bruce Willis's flat Rambo wannabe, were
uninspired and the set design crippled the film so badly it wasn't even
worth watching.
