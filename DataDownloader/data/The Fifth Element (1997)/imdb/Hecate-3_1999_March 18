1999_March 18 

I am a sci-fi/fantasy fan.  I very much enjoyed Besson's film, The
Professional.  I have enjoyed a lot of Bruce Willis's films.  I enjoyed Star
Wars but am not insane about it.  I was prepared to like this movie very
much, but (unlike everyone else who commented) I cannot say that I loved or
hated this film.<br /><br />I thought the movie had some good parts, and although Chris Tucker usually
annoys me, I thought his part in the fight scene was hilarious.  I had no
trouble following the plot, what there was of one, but I never believed in
the motivations of the characters.  Some of the characters and their
motivations were obviously not intended to be taken seriously, but I never
could believe in the love between the principals, even though that was
supposed to be what was saving the universe.  The only character who
involved me was the Diva, and she was a minor character who appeared in too
few scenes.  Also, maybe I missed something somewhere, but why was a person
(Leeloo) who supposedly knew nothing of Earth's languages and cultures able
to start sounding out and understanding words simply by seeing some writing?
And if she started out understanding writing, why couldn't she start out
knowing how to pronounce?<br /><br />I think it's worth the price of rental to see this movie, but I would not
purchase a copy.  However, the soundtrack is worth having.  Except for the
annoying bonus track (Thanks for the extra, guys!) the music is haunting and
evocative.  Lucia Di Lammermoor is beautifully performed by Inva Mulla
Tchako.  You might want to rent this movie just to check out the
music.
