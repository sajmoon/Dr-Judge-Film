This movie was, in short: Brilliant! When people think they are just going
to watch action, they are in for a surprise. Everything in this movie is
in
synch. The movie is complete, nothing is left out, nothing is forgotten.
The
movie is like a song, like a symphony. The best example is the part where
the fight begins in the theatre. The singer is performing and with what
she
sings, the pictures change. It's so hard to explain, but the combination
of
the music and the pictures, together with the costumes and the cast, make
this film a joyful ride.
