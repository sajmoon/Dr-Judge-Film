I've seen so many people bashing this movie I nearly bashed my moniter as
well.  This is definitely one of my favorites--you can't compare it to
anything and you can't take it seriously.  It's the simple tale of good
against evil--and many people have been saying that the whole 'love wins'
thing is really cheesy.  Well, I have a few theories about that--<br /><br />First of all, I know it was a little bogus, how they were all on love's side
but they killed a whole lot of people.  But--'protect life, until
death'--they only killed the people who's only mission was to destroy life.
It's not perfectly sensible, but close enough.<br /><br />And second of all, when you think about it, love is exactly opposite to
evil.  So no wonder it was the element to begin with.  But I like romance in
general, so I guess that's just my cheesy-ness shining through. Please--this
is just supposed to be a simple, fun, comedy/action with a hint of beautiful
romance, and is not to be taken so seriously.  It aggravated people to see
that it was being compared to Star Wars, and I agree--Star Wars is a
classic, and, well, The Fifth Element isn't, though it always will be for
me.<br /><br />I honestly don't see how anyone could hate this movie enough to rate it
below a 4.  There's nothing horribly wrong with it, the plot could be
patched up but it's not boring or confusing, at least not horribly so.  I
could watch this movie over and over if I wanted to, which I would do if it
wouldn't classify me as some sort of psycho by all the movie bashers.  Milla
Jovovich was amazing, Bruce was pretty good--I hadn't seen many of his
movies before this one, Gary Oldman was quite eccentric in his performance
and did a good job of being, well, evil.  The costumes were kind of freaky,
especially on Zorgs part, but there were no really cheap looking computer
special effects--I'm NOT saying they didn't use a computer, I'm just saying
they didn't look extremely stupid and out of place, like in some movies I've
seen.<br /><br />The movie was, all in all, fun, brilliant, and beautiful, though I think it
takes quite an open mind (or maybe just being stupid, as I am) to really
like it.  They could have developed the love between Leeloo and Korben,
though.  Good movie.  I'd give it at least an 8/10.
