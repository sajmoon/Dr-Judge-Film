This is a remarkable movie with a storyline that has never been seen
before. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker
star in the sci-fi hit of 1997 with dazzling special effects, action,
comedy, and romance set in a colorful, extravagant future where good
has fought evil every 5,000 years. Everyone aboard gives great
performances hands-down throughout. I could tell everyone had fun
working on this film, especially with creativity put into the costumes,
sets, creatures, the futuristic weaponry, the works. The visuals are
dated compared to today&#39;s standards and the film is a tad cartoonish
but that gives it charm and style and it&#39;s still good nonetheless. I
would&#39;ve liked to see the characters and the plot fleshed out more.
Those quibbles aside, The Fifth Element is a roller-coaster thrill ride
of a movie so see it and be amazed at the genuine sights and sounds of
this space epic.
