1998_December 27 

This movie really had it all as far as I was concerned. I don't really think
that anyone could manufacture something like this without an aspect of
unrealism.... but it has to be said... &quot;What a great film&quot;. Humour, action,
one-liners and all the rest. Not to be missed (unless a humerous bone was
removed at birth!)<br /><br />If you liked the forceful nature of Leon, you'll love Luc Besson's
futuristic effort. Excellent.
