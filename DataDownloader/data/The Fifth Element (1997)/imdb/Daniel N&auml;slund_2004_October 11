This is one of the greatest movies ever. I can't explain why, but the
whole feeling... The music, clothes, weapons and crafts... Everything
is in perfect harmony.<br /><br />The story is: A dude named Korben Dallas, Bruce Willis, is a former
fighter pilot, who nowadays makes his living as a cab driver. He runs
into Leeloo, played by Milla, a girl who the government resurrected from
a crash. She is the Fifth Element, who will save the world from Evil.
Evil is like a big living planet, that is rushing to Earth to destroy
the universe. It's up to Korben and Leeloo to save the world.<br /><br />That's all I will tell about the story. Not to mush and maybe to
little.<br /><br />Go and see it/rent it. It is surely worth it. You'll miss something
really cool if you don't.
