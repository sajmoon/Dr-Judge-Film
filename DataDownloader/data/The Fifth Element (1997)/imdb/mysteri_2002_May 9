I have to say that The Fifth Element is by far, one of my favorite movies.
I own it in both VHS and DVD (because my VHS began to wear out), and there
is no limit to how often you can watch and derive enjoyment from this
movie.<br /><br />It encompasses a realistic view of the future, using believable
technological advances, and an exciting story line.  The movie does not
depend on it's graphics, or special effects, but rather support a
wonderful
cast and exude the director's desired world.<br /><br />To be honest, I first saw the film for Bruce Willis, and I was pleasantly
surprised by Mila's performance.  Who knew that a model could act so well?
And of course, we can't forget Chris Tucker...amazing.  I felt that each
actor/actress completely embraced a science-fiction frame of mind and made
the film work.<br /><br />Finally, we have a true, timely science-fiction movie that can, and most
likely will still be believable in a few years time.  Compare it to Space
Oddessy 2001 (though it was much more an epic), and you'll quickly notice
that the technology used in that movie, like many others (such as star
trek), is laughable.<br /><br />Hollywood has always been enamoured with science-fiction, and in The Fifth
Element, they've hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Please enjoy!!!
