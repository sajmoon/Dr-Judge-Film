Yes it was interesting. It had some original elements and the direction was
engaging throughout. The greatest flaw was Bruce Willis however. His
attempts at comedy here make me wonder how it was that he managed to be
entertaining on &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. Of course he shines in the action parts
which is of course to say YAWN! Action movies are boring. Fortunately the
other aspects of the movie keep you watching.
