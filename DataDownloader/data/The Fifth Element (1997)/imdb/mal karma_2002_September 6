I couldn't stop watching it, and I can't, I see it every time it appears on
TV, I even read the book. The plot is nothing less than original although it
is basically good vs evil. The performances are adequate and good/great:
Willis, Holm, Jovovich (yummy), Tucker (funny as hell) and specially Gary
Oldman as the madman zOrg making once again an incredible villain. The FX
and the sound/music are supreme. It's a shining view of the world in the
future and I loved the flying cars &amp; taxi. But I'm more used to films such
as Aliens and Starship Troopers, that tend to be a little more conservative
when it comes to clothing and ships, because Fifth Element is thought to be
more creative and artistic, so it was a little hard to swallow. Neverthless
I love this movie and anyone should have a great time with this uncommon mix
of action, comedy (except the Lethal Weapon saga), and Sci Fi.<br /><br />It's even worth watching only to have a look at this Ucranian heavenly
creature known as Milla. 9/10
Have fun.
