Earth, water, air, and fire require a fifth element to battle evil: life
force. Loving life is not born from materialism; it is the darkness of
materialism that destroys the love of life. Every few thousand years, as
&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; reminds us, humanity develops an obsession with material
things and this evil threatens the destruction of civilisation.<br /><br />Fresh, bright, visually dazzling, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is the greatest
Science Fiction Comedy of all time. Its inspirational message of love will
draw tears, its uproarious humour will sap your breath from laughter, its
action scenes, including the largest indoor explosion ever created for film,
will have your amusement soaring.  Starring one of the most amiable stars of
the century - Bruce Willis - as well as Mila Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary
Oldman, and Chris Tucker, this is one for all ages to savour. This movie is
so much fun to watch that any flaws in the plot or in the editing are
rendered wholly inconsequential. Its eccentric Dickens-like characters are
an absolute delight, the dialogue is contagious, the soundtrack is
brilliant, the international flavour the film gives with its varied races
and accents rouses the heart with a glorious outlook on the future of the
world,  and the special effects are so breathtaking that the movie will look
good on any TV set. This is one film of which one will not tire easily after
repeated viewings. &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is a winner.
