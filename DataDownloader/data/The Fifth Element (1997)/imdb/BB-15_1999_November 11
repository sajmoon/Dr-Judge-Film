Science fiction is supposed to include meeting strange creatures from other
worlds and seeing events in the future but most of the characters in Sci-fi
films sound and act like they live in California and just walked on the set.
The Fifth Element is refreshing because it was made in Europe, with mostly
European actors. Also, the costuming has a French fashion over substance
look. All of this makes every scene seem out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Now with this different background the plot is pretty routine, evil is going
to destroy the world with a few more religious overtones added than usual.
Bruce Willis turns in an expectedly good performance. Milla Jovovich plays a
very off beat heroine well. Gary Oldman is an equally unusual villain. The
special effects are good. There is plenty of humor throughout the movie and
even though sometimes a joke misses (for instance with the mother of the
Willis character) I found the movie fun. On top of all this there is plenty
of shooting and explosions.  <br /><br />Now there is something about obnoxious characters. They don't bother me so
much in a sci-fi movie. Hey, this is supposed to be different so why not
weird characters. The Fifth Element has plenty of them including one named
Ruby Rhod who makes over the top seem tame. I figure the circus is in town
so I enjoyed the freak show. <br /><br />The Fifth Element shows that sci-fi can be stretched in unusual directions.
I recommend it for those who truly want to go to different place and
time.<br /><br />
