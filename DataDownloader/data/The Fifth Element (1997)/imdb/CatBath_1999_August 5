1999_August 5 

Like many, I had high hopes for this film.  Then I saw it.  Then I
couldn't
believe how horrible of an experience it was.  &quot;Star Wars for the '90s&quot;
indeed... whoever wrote that should be shot.  I hated this movie from the
very first tired cliche, where Corbin Dallas suddenly bolts upright from a
bad dream.  It was all downhill from there: the &quot;perfect&quot; specimen of a
human (sorry, she wasn't), Ruby (COMPLETELY pointless.  It was as if this
character was just thrown in there for the sole purpose of making this
movie
unbearable), Zorg's accent, the &quot;duck&quot; aliens, and the diva?  What the
hell
was that?  And to think that the movie instantly became TWICE as bad  in
the
final, laughably artificial emotional moments when we learn the 5th
element
is LOVE!  Love conquers all!  How profound!  Mr. Besson, I don't care if
your other movies were good--.
