Last time I watched this movie was about 10 years ago. I was a kid back
then and remembered only few scenes - like the taxi chase in the
beginning, the Plava Laguna show etc.. Now when I watched it again I
couldn&#x27;t believe how good this movie is. Clothing is kinda trashy (but
in a fun way), it&#x27;s full of humor, all the characters are perfect and
very peculiar (Leeloo, Zorg, General Munro :D and Ruby Rhod :D:D). <br /><br />I even value life more after watching it. It&#x27;s the part when Leeloo
says that why should she even bother protecting life if we do with it
what we do (accent on war and poverty). The fifth element is supposed
to be ether - the perfect, creative life force that&#x27;s all around us. I
appreciate it more now.<br /><br />Great movie!
