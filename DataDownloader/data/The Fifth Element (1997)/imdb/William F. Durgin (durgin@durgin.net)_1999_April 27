1999_April 27 

This is an incredibly good movie.  Even as sci-fi, the premise is lame, the
plot totally implausible, but the film construction flat-out incredible.
This is a movie for teaching movie-makers.  So tight, it takes a few
viewings to really see how tightly woven it is.  Not just the film cuts, but
the sound, the dialogue.  All tightly interwoven.  A LOT of effort from the
backstage went into this movie.  The jump cuts are from sound to image to
voice.  It may not be art, but the artistic mechanics kick butt.  For any
technician, this is a must see.
