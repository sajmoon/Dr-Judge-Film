This was actually a cool movie. Its PG-13 so the violence couldn't b so
graphic-DIE HARD. Willis does a cool job as the hero. He must find the 5
element. Chris Tucker also stars as a hyper-talking weiner shaped hairdo
singer. This movie was kind of weird 2 &amp; Gary Oldman was dumb &amp; annoying.
The creature effects were good. all in all, worth the rent.
