Why do I say that? Because I've seen this movie more times than anything
else.<br /><br />I love this movie. I love every aspect about it. The movie's style is
unlike
anything I've ever seen.<br /><br />I think it was a great move making the hero a cab driver. It reminds us
that
crappy jobs will always remain.<br /><br />I can't rave about this movie enough. I saw it in theatre's way back in 97
and have watched it every chance I had. Recently it's been played almost
nightly on TV, and every time I come across it, I stop and put the remote
down.<br /><br />Don't go into this movie expecting a MATRIX-like sci-fi movie (in the
sense
that sci-fi is dark and full of meaning that you have to look deeply to
find.)<br /><br />It's supposed to be a fun movie. Why would the future be full of
hypercolors
if you weren't supposed to have fun with it? A lot of people are
bad-mouthing this movie because of it's &quot;stupid&quot; portrayal of the future.
Well, who says it won't look that way? Personally I wish the ladies
working
at McDonalds looked like the ladies in this version of the
future.<br /><br />I'll say it again, this is my favorite movie of all time. Another reason
why? I have a tattoo of the 4 elemental stone symbols on my right
shoulder.<br /><br />Yeah. I love this movie that much.<br /><br />I am a Trekkie for this movie. This is my Star Wars. I guess that makes me
a
&quot;Fifty.&quot;
