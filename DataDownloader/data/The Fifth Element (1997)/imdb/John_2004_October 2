Imaginative, colorful, and entertaining. The plot was weak where the
&quot;Evil/Shadow&quot; and the bad guys were concerned, but the movie contained
enough new ideas to keep it fun. If you are a fan of the sci-fi genre,
there is a lot to like in the film. As a sci-fi buff, I really enjoyed
the imaginative scenery (luxury liners in space). It is always
interesting to see how writers and directors view life in the future.
The pace was fast and the action relatively believable. Bruce Willis'
Korbin Dallas character was entertaining, and could anchor a series of
similar films. Milla Jovovich was definitely eyecatching, and Chris
Tucker was absolutely hilarious as Ruby Rhod. One thing that I enjoy
about futuristic sci-fi movies is that the future is going to be
anything but boring. Good job Mr. Besson, keep up the good work.
