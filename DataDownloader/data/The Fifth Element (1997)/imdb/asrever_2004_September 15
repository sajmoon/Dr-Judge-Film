2004_September 15 

I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie since it was
released in 1997. I watch this movie at least 5 times per year and I
still don't get tire of it...I believe I never will. I have the DVD and
the Soundtrack, which I listen to even more frequently than watch the
movie. It's like I felt in love with this movie, of course exaggerating
things. It is so perfectly done and I would say that is just as perfect
as Leeloo (Milla Jovovich)is, the Fifth element itself. It is the
colors, the situations, the picture, the amazing future that Luc Besson
made up for us to see, the music (Eric Serra), the sounds, everything.
It's like a dream (and I really mean a dream of those we have once in a
while and makes us think we a going crazy) come true. It's like one of
those works of art that will always have a place in a famous museum. At
least that is was it comes to my mind when I think about The Fifth
Element, and I know some of this days I'll find my self watching it
again. Note: There is always something similar in Luc Besson's female
characters, if you see some of his other movies you will know what I'm
talking about. He makes all of his female characters appear to be wild
regarding to their feelings, they are all very full of emotions, seems
like they always feel twice as we do and that is really attractive.
