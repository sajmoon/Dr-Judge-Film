i love this movie. what is make this film special is the retro aspect
in the movie. i just love the sci-fi seventies they have put in the
film. a little stanley kubric feeling in it.<br /><br />great effects and humor and of course..... who doesn't fall in love
with Lilo(Milla jovovich)during the film??:) this is the type of movie
you can see over and over again and discover new things every time..<br /><br />and this is a french film by the way..you can tell by the number of
English actors. the opera singer (alien)is by the way digital tweeked
but who cares. its awesome opera/techno. finally and not least Eric
Serra the music Composer even if the movie sucked ii would give the
film a ten because of the soundtrack.
