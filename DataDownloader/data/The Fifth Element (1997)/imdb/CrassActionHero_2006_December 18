The Fifth Element (1997) Review: This is something. When It came out, I
looked forward to this. Damn over-hype. I hate you. When a movie sucks,
the huge hype only makes the disgust even more sour.<br /><br />The Fifth Element does not deliver at all. What the problem? It&#39;s
incredibly boring. The FX for it&#39;s time were cool. The FX are here
sometimes and look good. Other than that, this is an ugly movie. The
colors are poor. Also, the acting is quite wooden too. Bruce Willis is
just phoning it in here. Gary Oldman....what can I say? What is he
doing here? He not only looks ridiculous, but is not menacing at all.
One of the least convincing villains ever. This movie also drags along
slowly. SLOWLY. So slow and boring that I fell asleep while watching
this. I woke up.....it&#39;s still on! Ick. This movie is also too long.
The main problem: Freaking boring.<br /><br />The Last Word: Just plain bad. A lot of you reviewers are too kind.
This sucked. Watch out. The 7.2 rating here is an illusion. This is
more like a 1. Avoid.
