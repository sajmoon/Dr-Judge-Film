I personally own over 5,000 movies in both VHS and DVD. Even after
watching all of the movies in my collection I have to say The Fifth
Element is without a doubt the best movie of its kind I've seen to
date. The storyline, characters, costumes, script. All of it was superb
and reasonably realistic. I can see a future much like the one
represented in the film, and welcome the day (even if I'm old and Gray)
the future brings soomuch excitement. Great Movie!!! If a sequel could
be rendered i would definitely see it, and I'm sure it would surpass if
not equal the first. hopefully someday it will come to be, until then,
i hope everyone would share in my opinion, if not.......watch more
movies! ha-ha its the only way to truly understand the realism and
optimism behind the fifth element!
