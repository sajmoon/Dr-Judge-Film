I've always been a great fan of Luc Besson. With his chic Gallic ideas you
can be sure that the presentational style of any his films is always going
to be interesting.<br /><br />Leon is my favourite Besson film because it handles a difficult subject with
a steady &amp; intelligent hand, while still offering plenty of explosions &amp; gun
fights to keep the action fans content.<br /><br />The 5th Element, however, is more of mixed bag and I do feel he went a
little too far with the ingredients - adding far too much visual candy and
not enough dialogue &amp; logic. The final outcome is a rather a mismatch of
stylish ideas based on a thin storyline foundation.<br /><br />For Willis, as our 23rd century cab driver turned galactic hero, its just
another Die Hard vehicle. As soon as he dons his white vest you just know
he's going to be involved in a load of death defying stunts. So there are no
radical acting departures for Willis which is a poor start because once we
realize this fact everything else becomes a tad predictable.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich, as the alien visitor Leeloo, does a good job of a rather
dysfunctional character. She doesn't have to do very much apart from mumble
some alien speech and come over all cutesy and doey eyed when required.<br /><br />Ian Holm is grossly miscast as the all-knowing priest. You can sometimes see
from his body language &amp; facial expressions how uncomfortable he feels with
the dialogue &amp; acting he is given. He tries hard to convince but I think he
inwardly knows that this film is just plastic pap with a heavy dose of
French mustard.  <br /><br />Gary Oldman plays the fascist yet again, hamming it up like there's no
tomorrow (which in this particular film is just as well), just like in
Besson's earlier film, Leon. Credit where credits due though, he does seem
to be enjoying his role more than the others and you're almost guaranteed a
good performance from him no matter how poor the script.<br /><br />Chris Tucker, however, really does ruin this film big style. He is totally
OTT and screams &amp; shouts like a little brat not getting his Christmas
treats. The film is loud &amp; garrish enough with him having to add to it, but
he does so anyway and makes a real hash of everything around
him.<br /><br />On the whole therefore, the film will be remembered more for its special
effects than logical storyline. Besson has gone overboard with the $90
million budget,spending at least 95% of it on the sfx and the other 5% on
the story, which is a great great shame.<br /><br />With a more intelligent script and with perhaps James Cameron or Gayle Anne
Hurd producing, then I'm sure this film would have been a real blockbuster
rather than the hotch potch we have here.<br /><br />***/*****
