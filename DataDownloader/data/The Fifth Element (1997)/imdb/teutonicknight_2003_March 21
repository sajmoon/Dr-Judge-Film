I wonder why so many people claim this movie is rubbish. I know it isn't
Stanley Kubrick or Orson Welles but as for its genre &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is
one of the best. It isn't artistic cinema ; rather a comic containing all
the elements that make a smashing picture. <br /><br />Besson is one of my favourites, and again he didn't dissapoint me. &quot;The
Fifth Element&quot; is not as marvellous as &quot;Leon&quot; but is an example of a well
done job, dynamic and entertaining, quite intelligent in its lack of
seriousness and director's distance to it. Its just a Besson's childhood
dream made into a feature.<br /><br />What I like most about this film are the actors; Willis didn't show anything
new, but was in good shape , Ian Holm was brilliant as an overexcited priest
of 25th century , my favourite actor Gary Oldman once again proved that any
role is suitable for him (his performance was brilliant , a villain with a
British sense of humour, and a Nicholson-like character) and obviously Milla
Jovovich (I was really surprised, I didn't expect her being so
talented).<br /><br />The rest was almost as good. The story had some holes, but as I said (wrote)
before it's not an artistic cinema. I loved the director's vision of the
25th century world, and all the costumes by Gaultier (although generally I
hate the guy and the stuff he designs), both very bright and colourful as
well as a bit tasteless (in positive meaning of the word).<br /><br />All in all I'd give it 8.5 if I could but in that case....... strong 8/10.
