How can a movie with such an overused plot be my absolute favorite? There
are no earth-shattering themes (although an earth-obliterating black sphere
threatens all life).  Goodness, love and innocence triumph as we know it
shall.  Yet somehow the fantastic costumes, outrageous sets, splendidly
diverse music combine like a perfect recipe carried out by an accomplished
chef.  The editing keeps the movie well-paced, the characters are cast
well-- each supporting character looks like a real human being instead of a
model (except the aliens, of course).  The professor, the young Arabic
children, the messed up robber in the hall, the stewardi and pilots and
ground crew each bring a touch of individuality to the whole.<br /><br />The acting is superb, both main and supporting roles:  Gary Oldman is the
perfect villain with exacting delivery of his lines.  The priest and his
assistant create a wonderful comic duo and Milla is my choice for the
Supreme Being combining innocence and power. Bruce Willis brings his boyish
charm to the role of reluctant hero, for once ignored in the face of Ruby
Rod, the futuristic love interest of every panting female fan.  His
screaming through bombs, barrages of machine guns, and invading aliens all
the while oblivious to our heroes' saving the universe keeps the audience
laughing out loud.<br /><br />Excellent work by the actors and editors make each scene a delight.  You
can't wait to see what is next.  And even when you do know, it holds up well
to repeat viewings.
