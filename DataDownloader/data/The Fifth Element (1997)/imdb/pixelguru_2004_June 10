2004_June 10 

My wife and I love this movie. It's not your usual dark moody sci-fi
picture, and it has a very unique view of the far future... at times
the look is stylized and comic-book-like. At times it is grungy and
filled with endless details of the daily drudgery that the denizens
face... muggings, garbage disposal, pollution, corruption, security,
and overcrowding are all touched upon in ways that make you cringe and
giggle at the same time.<br /><br />The parts of the film where multiple conversations and actions are all
happening simultaneously (phone booth conversation, ship launch and
Ruby's make-out session for example) are particularly well done... the
weaving together of different event happening at different locations is
seamlessly executed and keeps the action moving without any lulls.
Costuming, set, and soundtrack all work together to keep your senses
flooded with detail during all of this. The Gaultier costuming...
wow... I hope the world never comes to that, but it fit right into the
movie and really added to the futuristic feel.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is... well... er.. he's the Die Hard guy transplanted into
the future. I guess you can't have it all. I guess they wanted a big
star to headline such an expensive production. Milla is great until she
starts to speak English... the &quot;divine language&quot; she babbles in the
first part of the movie is amazing. Chris Tucker's role as DJ Ruby Rhod
is worth the price of admission alone though.
