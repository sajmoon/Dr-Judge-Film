Essentially, The Fifth Element is an excuse for Luc Besson to be
coarse, camp, creative and get Milla Jojovich on screen in very little
clothing. Now all that looks fairly reasonable on paper, but the film
that comes out of it is an over stylised, European-comic blancmange...
with Bruce Willis at its centre.<br /><br />Still interested? Fair enough - I actually rather liked Willis, cast on
type and holding the flannel together with his robust non-nonsense
persona. But watch - you can see him smirking in almost every take.
Jojovich is much more obedient and her mute superwoman works under the
auteur&#39;s direction. The problems are with the silly story line, which
not even a powerfully sobering Ian Holm can calm. There are clunky
puppetted aliens, Gary Oldman looks like his irascibility comes from
the egg growing from his head and a phenomenally irritating Chris
Tucker as some sort of shock-jock queen. I know he&#39;s meant to rub one
up the wrong way, but mon dieu... 4/10
