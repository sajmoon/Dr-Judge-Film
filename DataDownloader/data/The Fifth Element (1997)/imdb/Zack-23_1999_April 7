1999_April 7 

I have been disappointed by a great number of shoot-em-up, special effects
laden Science Fiction adventure stories but I really loved The Fifth
Element.  The story IS simple, but no less imaginable than a bad plot that
tries to hide its failings through numerous twists and complications.  I
thought Willis was great (as far as Willis-type characters go) and the Zorg
character was interestingly portrayed by Oldman.  The Ruby Rod character was
so outrageous as to be a perfect foil for Corbin's Gary Cooperisms (&quot;yep&quot;,
&quot;nope&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;).  The scenes with the Diva added tons of class to the genre
(she even captivates Corbin) and I am going to hunt for records of Ms.
Tchako's singing.  Lee-Loo is cuter than a hundred buttons.  Great
fun.
