Even with a bit of off-the-wall silliness, the plot and effects are
creative, Bruce Willis is entertaining, Chris Tucker as Ru-by Rhod! is
a sight not to be missed, and Milla Jovovich puts the sizzle into one
of the most alluring roles I&#x27;ve seen in any movie. Ever.<br /><br />Ma&#xEF;wenn Le Besco, Gary Oldman and Ian Holm also deliver solid
supporting performances.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t say much about the plot. It&#x27;s passable, but that&#x27;s not really
where the fun is. It&#x27;s in the characters, the acting and the action,
from Korben Dallas to Leeloo to Ruby Rhod. <br /><br />Get yourself a &#x22;Mooltipass,&#x22; because The Fifth Element is considerable
fun.
