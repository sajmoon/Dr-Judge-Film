1999_March 30 

Luc Besson did it again, a job well done!
He wrote this sci-fi fantasy story when he was in high school, and didn't
that produce the best thought for this kind of movie? when you're a
teenager?
This movie has got it all, sci-fi, comedy, action, adventure and
romance.
Bruce Willis just kicked butt, Gary Oldman was as evil as ever, and Milla
Jovovich just played it well.
The complementary colors used by Luc Besson in the movie was very
amazing(eg. blue and yellow), it look just so nice.
The music is cool too, credit goes to Eric Serra.
You got to see this film!!!
