I've watched this movie pretty often since I purchased the video, and
consider it to be one of my favorites.  Chris Tucker makes the entire
movie
with his outrageous performance as Ruby Rhod.  And Gary Oldman gets to
shine
again as yet another psycho freak.  I think that the movie has enough
action
to be interesting, and in its own bizarre way the plot holds together.
It's
supposed to be unbelievable (it IS 300 years in the future!).  I think
it's
a fun flick to pass the time.
