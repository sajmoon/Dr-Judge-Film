2000_December 27 

This movie was pretty awful.  The robots with the tiny duck heads were
pretty amusing, but beyond that, there was little to recommend this.
Appalling overacting, a really hackneyed plot, and a very obvious ending.
There are some superficial resemblances to the excellent &quot;Blade Runner&quot;,
but
the only real connection is Brion James, who was excellent in the earlier
film and terrible here.  The film is more like a Saturday morning cartoon
than a comic book.  I got really sick of the endless gunfights in which
Bruce Willis hits the mark with every bullet, but the bulldog/pig-headed
aliens can't hit anything.  And the motivations are inexplicable.  Why
would
anyone take a payoff to help someone who is trying to destroy the
universe?
Where does Zorg think he's going to spend that money?  And when we finally
get to the climactic moment, and Bruce Willis says, &quot;I love you&quot;, my
reaction was, &quot;Why?  You've only spent about three minutes with her over
the
course of the film, she's only uttered about a half-dozen words that you
were able to understand, and the one time you showed affection toward her,
she pulled a gun on you.&quot;<br /><br />At least I saw this on DVD for free.
