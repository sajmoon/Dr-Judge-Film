2000_August 2 

That's the best way to summarize this film. Its stupidity is only surpassed
by its entertainment value, and as such, it survives.<br /><br />This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen, and along with
Starship Troopers probably the dumbest film that I truly
loved.<br /><br />As always, I find Gary Oldman capable of the most astonishing characters. In
this film he manages to be a parody of the most evil Hitler-type person one
could imagine complete with childish outbursts and awesome firepower - and
yet he makes him ridiculous enough to fit into some kid matin&eacute; or a cartoon.
He is the main reason why I liked this film so much.
