1999_June 5 

Plastic plastic everywhere. Why most of the people working at a SF movie
has
such a miserable opinion of SF fans?
This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen: the story is poor, no
ideas, bad acting. Besson has forgotten the courage shown in Subway (even
Lambert seemed an actor...) and steers boldly towards the Land of 1000
Colours, Lights, Magic (and a lot of Industrial interests too, if you see
what I mean).
And a pretty face does NOT make an actress.
And why did the great Gary Oldman get trapped in such a
mess?
Even a stupid &quot;new-age-like&quot; ending. I rated this
foolish film 3, and now, please, help me find my Blade Runner
vhs.
