From the music, (Especially the Indian music) to the acting to the imagery
this was one of Bruce Willis' best films! Don't forget Gary Oldman, (check
him out in Bram Stoker's Dracula) a great acting turn by Milla Jovovich and
Chris Tucker (funny!) and Ian Holm, all very great!
When I first saw it on cable I watched it over and over.  ***Let's not
forget Diva Plavalaguna!  I give it a wicked thumb's up!
