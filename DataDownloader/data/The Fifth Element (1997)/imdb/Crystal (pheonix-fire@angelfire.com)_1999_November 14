1999_November 14 

I think this is one of the best films ever made.  I have watched
thousands
of movies, and this one is in my top 3.  The combination of creativity,
vitality, acting, and general greatness in this movie is stunning.<br /><br />I might be a little prejudiced, since I love Milla Jovovich and Bruce
Willis, but there is no mistaking the power behind this movie.  Plava
Laguna
is one of the greatest aliens I have seen in ages.  And, while they did
tend
to get a bit revealing on the women, most of the costumes (especially
Milla's!) were amazing.<br /><br />I have seen this movie more than 20 times, and I still marvel at the sheer
genius behind it.
