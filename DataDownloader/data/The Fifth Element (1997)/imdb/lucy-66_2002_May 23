People told me I'd like this film and find it funny. I don't trust people
any more. 
It's unwatchably bad and usually good actors like Ian Holm are atrocious.
Give 
me an old Dr Who episode from the 70s any day. What's really depressing is<br /><br />the realisation that Frenchmen like women who pout and simper in a bad<br /><br />imitation of a small child.
