Don't ask me why, but this movie is just entertaining,
pure
and simple. I watched the first 5 minutes by accident and
it
just sucked me in. All the acting is fine, the FX awesome,
but
there is just something about the directing that makes it
an
enjoyable and fun movie. Its very fast paced with an excellent sound track.
Milla Jovanovich is very powerful as a partial
mute. Everyone else is just along for the ride.
