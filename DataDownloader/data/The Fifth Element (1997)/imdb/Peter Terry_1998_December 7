1998_December 7 

After the first ten minutes of viewing this film, I shut off the VCR. I
never would have seen the whole thing if my little cousin hadn't begged me
to watch it. The visuals are good, but I strongly believe that this film
takes a nose dive (Entertainment wise) after the first scene with the flying
cars.
Watching the &quot;Jetsons movie&quot; is more entertaining. I give this sorry film a
6 out of 10.
