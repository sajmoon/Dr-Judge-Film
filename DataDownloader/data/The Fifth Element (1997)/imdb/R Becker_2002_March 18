There's something about French SF -- it's got that whole &quot;Metal Hurlant,&quot;
a-bit-overripe-and-a-bit-too-earnest-and-silly feel (these things really
need Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud to steer them, or Truffaut, if he weren't dead).
The hammy and overrated Gary Oldman plays his usual cheeseball villain in a
collection of affected mannerisms and expressions, while Willis' hero
(well,
sort of) falls into one weird (but pretty) situation after another.  In its
favor, the movie gives you a whole other world of imagination.  In its
disfavor, the world it shows you makes little sense and is a bit
over-designed.  Usual &quot;chosen-one-must-save-the-world&quot; plot we've been
forced to watch in SF and fantasy for the past 25 years (can you say
&quot;pyrotechnic special effects finale?&quot;); tune out the plot and dialogue but
stay for the cool designs (and the funny-looking ones,
too)!
