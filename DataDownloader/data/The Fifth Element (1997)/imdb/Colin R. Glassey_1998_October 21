5th Element, while not a perfect film is easily the best SF film of 1997.<br /><br />Great: Visual Effects - especially the re-creation of Leelou, and the
pleasure boat. Casting - Bruce was a bit &quot;calm&quot; while the rest of the cast
seemed to be on speed. Perfectly cast were: Mila, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker,
and all the flight attendants (yeah!). The opening sequence: fantastic, with
the right blend of mystery and imagination.<br /><br />Not so great: Plot holes - Zorg, as world's richest man, going off to kill
people by himself. Corporate titans DON'T do this sort of thing. Underlying
theme: Leelou has to fall in love in order to save the Earth? Kind of lame,
no?<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed watching this film greatly. It has a French style and a
&quot;world-view&quot; that is quite different from your &quot;normal&quot; American science
fiction (as defined by the Star Wars, Star Trek films).
