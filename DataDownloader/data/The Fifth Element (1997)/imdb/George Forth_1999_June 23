1999_June 23 

I cannot get enough of this film. Luc Besson is a terrific writer/director
generally, but this is like nothing he has ever made.<br /><br />The imagery is stunning in its colour and design; The costumes are mad as
only Gaultier can manage; the story is wild and untamed.<br /><br />Religion, science, war, good, and evil are all represented in this film,
and
it is done with a superb cast and a fluid script. Naturally, suspense of
imagination is necessary, but it's sci-fi!<br /><br />But this is non-conformist sci-fi. The future is bright and breezy, not
dark
and gloomy. Radio is alive and well - we're not all living in a
hyper-technicised bubble, but roaming free with a loopy DJ in our ears,
and
whingeing mothers on the phone. It's the same, but it's
different.
