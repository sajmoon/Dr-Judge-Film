1998_October 27 

I loved this film.  The beautiful Milla is the perfect casting for &quot;love&quot;
embodied.  The delivery of her alien language in bubbling soft tones was
hypnotic. Action packed with special effects as good as any - lots of
imagination went into every aspect.  Costume design was forefront in
futuristic artsy fun erotic.  Bruce - well what can you say - he's Bruce and
I can't complain about that. Just great sci-fi good guy/bad guy shoot em up
with lots of extras.
