From the vast timeless desert expanse of Egypt, then reaching far out
into space, touching the future of Earth, comes an extraordinary story
of how a race of beings have come to protect the planet Earth from
ultimate oblivion. In order to do that, the powerful Mondoshawan race
entrusted four very special elemental stones within a crept to be used
in conjunction with The Fifth Element which morphs them into an
unimaginable power of cosmic proportions. The story itself is fantastic
in it&#39;s inception, wondrous in it&#39;s creation, explosive in it&#39;s
delivery and dynamic in it&#39;s projected outcome. The film advances
rapidly through the masterful and exciting talents of Bruce Willis as
taxi driving Korben Dallas and Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel
Zorg. He is devilishly crafty as the servant of the Great Evil. Ian
Holm is religiously mysterious as Father Vito Cornelius and Milla
Jovovich is excitingly sexy as Leeloo. All in all, with the great
spectrum of colorful characters, weapons and special effects, writer,
director Luc Besson blends drama, tragedy and comedy to create a
superior film which evolves quietly into a classic. ****
