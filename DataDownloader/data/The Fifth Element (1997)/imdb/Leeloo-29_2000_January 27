The Fifth Element, WOW, the movie really rocks. Milla Jovovich and Bruce
make a great set and they both put a lot of hard work into this film, I
believe. Its a true piece of science-fiction for sure but its different
from
every other monster, super natural film. Its really unique and new which
makes it memorable to all viewers and most who view it, not film critics,
I've noticed really enjoyed it because they don't look for the practical
things they look for the different, odd, and unexpected. The Fifth Element
is perfect for anyone who likes the word unique.
