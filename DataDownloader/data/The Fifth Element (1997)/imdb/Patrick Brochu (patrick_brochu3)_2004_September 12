I watched the 5th Element and I found it to be a very well done movie.
It is a fun movie to watch from beginning to end. I really enjoyed all
the actions scenes in the movie and I find the Bruce Willis was perfect
for the movie. The 5th Element is like a roller-coaster, it's a fun ride
from start to finish. The storyline of the movie is also well done as
well as the plot of the movie. Chris Tucker does a good job in the
movie as DJ Ruby Rhod. Gary Oldman is excellent as Jean-Baptiste
Emanuel Zorg, who is a nasty villain. Milla Jovovich is also good in
the movie as Leeloo. For the people who have Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround
Sound, they will not be disappointed with the sound quality of the
movie.
