Gary Oldman is one of the finest actors around.  Since &quot;Sid and Nancy,&quot; he
has
been the ultimate unappreciated gem, similar to Kevin Spacey was before
&quot;The
Usual Suspects.&quot;  Oldman needs an Oscar and a legitimate big-budget
starring
role.<br /><br />He doesn't need crap like &quot;The Fifth Element.&quot;  This is akin to asking
Tarantino
to direct &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; and forcing him to stick to the
script.<br /><br />Aside from Oldman, none of the acting was good, which probably doesn't say
as
much about the actors as it does about the script.  Leeloo learns about
all
the
bad and nasty things in the world through a cyber-Brittanica and becomes
morose.  Oooh, wow, try walking through an American city sometime, hon.
Come to think of it, isn't watching Bruce Willis act one of the bad and
nasty
things in the world?<br /><br />We need movies that do not build to stupid, sappy endings and do not take
themselves seriously in that endeavour.
