1999_November 5 

Stanislaw Lem said once, most of the so-called Science
Fiction
literature is not really SF in his eyes. Because they don't
seriously think about how science might develop in future.
If
you follow his strict advice, neither Star Wars nor The
fifth
element are true SF movies.<br /><br />However, both pictures are very good entertainment. Too,
both
are fairy tales, but while Star Wars tries to be serious,
contains much magic and pseudoscience, the fifth element
looks more like some kind of drug trip.<br /><br />The basic story couldn't be more trashy. Bruce Willis,
who
is the best soldier of the world seeks the perfect woman
and
- finds one. Besides he has to fight against some gigantic
black hole which is the personalized evil.<br /><br />But this doesn't matter, nay, simply fits. Crazy people
(Chris
Tucker!), funny dialogues, very much slapstick, good action
scenes, sweet romance, very good camera work - there is
never
a limit. Every scene is made so well, you can simply watch
this movie again and again without getting bored.<br /><br />This my second favorite of Bruce Willis, the first one
is
of course Die hard.
