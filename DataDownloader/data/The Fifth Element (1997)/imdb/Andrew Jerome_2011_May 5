Bruce Willis&#x27;s technicolour trash heap of a film, with Milla
whatsername babbling incoherently gets the worst futuristic film gong
ever. Combining hokey science fiction, quasi-religious sentiments, and
a garish French new wave fashion sensibility, this mess has a bad plot
that just has a lot of stupid things happening very, very fast.
Although this movie is literally dripping with eye-popping special
effects, they&#x27;re all hung on a scatterbrained plot that is
incomprehensible. This overblown cosmic comic book was boring, idiotic
and an over-priced sham. &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; ends up being a major
disappointment, not because it doesn&#x27;t provide enough, but because it
provides too much.
