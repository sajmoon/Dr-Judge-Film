Comedic science fiction-adventure from Luc Besson, with a screenplay
Besson co-wrote based upon on a story he originally devised in his
teenage years, shows definite signs the filmmaker was entranced--as
were we all--with &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; and &#x22;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#x22;.
Unfortunately, Besson doesn&#x27;t possess the canny, joshing touch of a
Lucas or Spielberg, who were also derivative within these genres yet
more commercially-viable. Besson doesn&#x27;t have a clue how to warm up an
audience, and one cannot watch a film like &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; without
counting off all the movie references (a little &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; here, a
bit of &#x22;Die Hard&#x22; there). Bruce Willis, as a Brooklyn cabbie in the
23rd century, is still doing his John McClane schtick--unshaven and
gruffly adorable, with a punky-blonde shock of hair. After a
gibberish-speaking punk-waif female drops into his taxi, Willis&#x27; Korben
Dallas becomes involved in a search for four mystical stones which are
imperative in preventing world destruction. Obviously, the art
direction and design of this thing are amazing; yet, on another level,
it merely looks like an inordinate amount of money and imagination
wasted on a dime-novel yarn, a futuristic-noir (one with irritating
changing music cues, from rock to reggae to opera). For those who stick
with it, the finale--after Besson has dispensed with the redundant
gunfire and explosions--manages to come together effectively, though
the picture still doesn&#x27;t leave its audience with much beyond a sense
of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. *1/2 from ****
