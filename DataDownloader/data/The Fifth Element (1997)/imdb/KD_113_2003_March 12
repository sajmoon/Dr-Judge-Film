This film is a fine example of not taking drama or sci fi to the limit
where
no one understands it! The story line although a little complex is great
and
totally original who had ever thought of a fifth element and top marks
for
putting Milla Jovovich in it she's great her moments of comedy are great
too!
Luc Besson i take my hat of to you great directing some how you manage to
get sci fi, romance, comedy, fantasy, drama and action into a film and
make
it not just work but amaze. Every time I have watched it (over 10 now) I
found some thing else to love. It has it's critics but maybe they are
trying
to hard and should sit back and be amazed by the excellence that just
is....the fifth element.<br /><br />
