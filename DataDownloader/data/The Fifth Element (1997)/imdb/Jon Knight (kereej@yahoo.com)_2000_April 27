<br /><br />A combination of many elements, yet manages to keep its own unique charm.
Long ago, in a galaxy right in our own backyard, a weapon to save life
against the ultimate incarnation of evil is taken from earth to store in a
safe place. 300 years later, (the future for us, that is) the 5 elements
that make this weapon work must be gathered together on Earth in order to
save the galaxy. In other words, if not brought together in time, we will be
screwed.<br /><br />What follows is an action packed roller coaster ride that will take you
through the charmingly humorous and colorful science fiction reality that is
both fun, and adventurous. The main characters do a wonderful job,
especially Milla, in bringing this story to life. Its also about finding
that perfect love that comes around once in a lifetime, and how it molds our
true destiny into the inner fabrics of the galaxy.
