That's for sure, but if you say that this movie is stupid, I think that
you're the one who does't watch real movies, the mainstream nonsense
movies. This movie has a good plot, and even though it is a science
fiction movie there are references to philosophical points in life. The
one emotion that strikes us al: LOVE. <br /><br />OK, so the movie: Bruce Willis is great as ever. Milla is the coolest.
Gary Oldman is good, but Chris Tucker is a little bit annoying. But OK,
maybe it's because of his voice which is as worse as Fran &quot;The Nanny&quot;
Drescher. But still, the movie is great, if you still haven't seen it,
watch it. I've ordered the region 2 DVD and I know that I will watch
the movie time after time.
