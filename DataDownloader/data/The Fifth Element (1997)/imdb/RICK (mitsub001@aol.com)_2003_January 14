Where else can you get comedy,action, incredible special effects,
the
acting of Gary Oldman and the beauty of Milla Jovovich all in
one
beautifully photographed movie? Plus great music and costumes
that
rivaled much larger budgeted movies. I own this movie and will never tire
of
watching it. If you haven't seen this movie...see it. If
you
did see it and you were with some whiny know-it-all that talked
you
into not liking it because he couldn't understand it..then see it again
without him/her. And if you are that know-it-all....wake up and
admit
that you were wrong. This concludes my totally unbiased
review!
