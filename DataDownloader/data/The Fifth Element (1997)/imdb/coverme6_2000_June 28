I have to say the only reason I like &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; were<br /><br />the stellar special effects. If it weren't for the 
pyrotechniques, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; would have been a total<br /><br />bomb. The performances were a bit cardboard stiff and lifeless,<br /><br />especially the acting of Bruce Willis. It seemed obvious that<br /><br />Willis was getting tired of making shoot-em-up action flicks, as<br /><br />if the word &quot;typecast&quot; were his nickname! So in other words, if<br /><br />you love awesome, &quot;Star Wars&quot;ish science fiction movies, watch<br /><br />&quot;The Fifth Element,&quot; but if you are also looking for a film with<br /><br />perfect performances as well as effects, try &quot;Star Wars&quot;<br /><br />instead, and avoid &quot;The Fifth
