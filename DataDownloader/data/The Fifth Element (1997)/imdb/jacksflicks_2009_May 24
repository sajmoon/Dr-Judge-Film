There&#x27;s Bruce Willis, who can act but, except for Die Hard, Sixth Sense
and maybe a couple of others, has never chosen his starring vehicles
wisely. There&#x27;s Milla Jovovich, who&#x27;s very beautiful and who can act a
little. There&#x27;s Ian Holm, who can act, thrown into the mix. Gary Oldman
plays his usual costumed cad. And there&#x27;s Luke Perry, in a stupid part.
The rest can&#x27;t act. Some are there solely because of dubious celebrity
status, like the incredibly bad Tommy &#x22;Tiny&#x22; Lister. Then, there&#x27;s
Chris Tucker doing his screech shtick.<br /><br />The f/x is OK, but there&#x27;s nothing original about this movie. It&#x27;s
Blade Runner -- Willis doing Harrison Ford, Jovovich doing Daryl Hannah
(complete with somersaults) -- meets Flash Gordon -- all the
interstellar camp and glossy glitz -- deducting about 8 years and/or 30
IQ points for the intended audience. From the absurd scores it gets,
I&#x27;d say it found its audience.<br /><br />Luc Besson hasn&#x27;t done much directing since this one. I can see why.
