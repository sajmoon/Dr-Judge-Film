Chris Tucker&#x27;s performance as the radio host Ruby Rhod is a lot for the
mind to deal with. His manner of speech, appearance, mannerisms, and
personality add up to a great deal of mental stimulation. The signal
coming off of Ruby Rhod is so high it may be subject to the conceptual
equivalent of audio clipping. One might think about a normal person,
&#x22;Oh, there they are. I know who that is. I know what they are saying to
me. I know why they are moving their body in that fashion.&#x22; With Ruby
Rhod, one thinks, &#x22;Ahhh! Oh my God, what is that? Turn it off! Is that
a person? What&#x27;s going on? Someone stop that!&#x22;<br /><br />It is also strange that a radio personality plays such a big part in
the plot. If you or I were to make a movie about people in the future
meeting aliens and saving the world and so forth we might not think to
include a hilarious shrieking gay stereotype.<br /><br />With Gary Oldman&#x27;s performance as Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, similar
problems occur, though constrained to his accent and the manner in
which Jean-Paul Gaultier has dressed him. Some English people, like Mr.
Oldman, have an unsophisticated understanding of the English language
as it is spoken by Americans.
