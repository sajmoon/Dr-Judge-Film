Imagine if people came out to say, &quot;Oh please, A giant walking Teddy Bear.
How outrageous!&quot; about our favorite Wookie. Sci-Fi IS outrageous. The 5th
Element takes a look into an unwritten future and does a very good job of
story telling. When Bruce Willis wakes up, reads the words &quot;KEEP CLEAR&quot;, and
sighs &quot;I try&quot; he speaks the same sentiments most of the working class share.
This is a great Fantasy with colors and action that jump off the screen. I
feel Bruce Willis does a great job playing the reluctant hero that doesn't
really care about the world's dilemma, only his own search for the perfect
love. The 5th Element is the perfect movie for sci-fi buffs who can set
reality aside and see the story at hand instead of comparing everthing to
Star Wars. The rest of the story is fast moving with great performances by
Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, and Chris Tucker. As far as I'm concerned the
movie wasn't long enough.
