This is a silly and comic science fiction tale of unlikely heroes, a
diabolic villain, utterly brain dead mercenaries and monks touting an
ancient prophecy set years in the future.  Gary Oldman (the diabolic
villian), Ian Holm (the main prophecy touting monk) and Chris Tucker make an
excellent supporting cast that sometimes overshadow Bruce Willis.  Chris
Tucker at many moments steals the show as the RuPaul like, strutting and
screaming, way over the top, intergalactic talk show host, Ruby Rhod who
can't make you do anything but laugh as a parody of many of today's talk
show hosts.  There is an excellent score behind this movie that is capped
off by Ma&iuml;wenn Le Besco beautiful performance as the Diva Plavalaguna.  I
found the special effects good, the costumes excellent and the soundtrack
great.
