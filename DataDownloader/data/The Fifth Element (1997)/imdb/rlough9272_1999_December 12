1999_December 12 

The Fifth Element was an absolutely appalling film. The special effects were
good, but the rest was awful. The story was bland and pathetic. It also
lasted way too long. Also, was there really any need for that stupid man
with the squeaky voice? If I had not paid to see it, I wouldn't have even
watched it to the halfway point. About six months later I paid to see it
again on pay per view, to see if it was better second time around. That time
I did NOT make it to the half way point.
