I saw 5E on a rainy night in Belfast, I was sat on my own right in front of
the screen. I loved the visuals, however I did recognise great big
references to Metropolis, Raiders of the lost Arc,Blade Runner etc. I've
just seen it again on video, and hated it. Horribly smug Bruce Willis,
wretched acting everywhere else. But this leads me to one of my &quot;bees in the
bonnet&quot; that when you see a film on the big screen and a small screen, you
are seeing two DIFFERENT films. IMDB comments should have a check box to
indicate where you saw a film, it makes an important difference.
