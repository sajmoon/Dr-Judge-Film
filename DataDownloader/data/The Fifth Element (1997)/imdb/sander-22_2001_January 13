The 5th element is a masterpiece. The actors, the music (the opera), the
directing and editing, the choreography (the leeloo kung-fu scene), it is
for lack of a better word - PERFECT. Entertainment like it should be.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, go see it. Be sure to check out other great Luc
Besson movies like Taxi, Taxi 2, Leon, Nikita, etc.<br /><br />Thank you Luc!
