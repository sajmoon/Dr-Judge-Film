Fifth Element may have the WORST plot for a sci-fi film this side of
Soldier, but it is a thrill ride. The effects and the cracking dialog keep
your attention. The worst thing in this movie was Bruce Willis but he and
his John McClane type bravado was largely kept at bay by the director
(thank
God!).<br /><br />The surprise was Milla Jovovich who I thought gave a sexy performance as
the
cute, powerful yet vulnerable 'element'. She is a good actress no matter
what the detractors say.<br /><br />Tucker is loud and obnoxious as usual, tolerable in parts. Its just as well
that his role is limited!<br /><br />Overall, I watched it through ONLY for the delectable Miss
Jovovich.
