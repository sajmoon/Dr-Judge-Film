2000_February 13 

So this is what the art of visual spectacle has come to.  &quot;Fantasia&quot;
(1940),
&quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;2001&quot; (1968), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) - I could add
many other examples - were all thrilling in various ways.  &quot;The Fifth
Element&quot; merely induces a headache.  I'll give Besson his due for having
the
right kind of general idea.  He wants to give us a guided tour of the
rainbow, and he has a good deal of success, in individual scenes.  He
knows
that computers alone won't do the trick.  The perfect lighting combines
with
set and costume design to serve up some lovely colour-cocktails:
president's
purple throne room, the villain standing in a corridor of weed-tinted
green,
the blue soprano singing in front of a dark indigo arches framing a ripe
blue planet.  But it doesn't always work.  Sometimes Besson's sense of
colour fails him and the result is a mess.  And apart from his sense of
colour he has nothing to fall back on.  The design of the future - it's
all
visual design - is mostly a compendium of clich&eacute;s, mixed in with a
souped-up
vision of the 1990s: an empty, hip, MTV flashiness.  Some of the computer
images work, but most of them - the traffic shots in particular - feature
the kind of cheesy rendering and animation that will forever be the
industry
standard, if we're not careful.<br /><br />Hipness - that's Besson's guiding star.  He doesn't even care what his
film
looks like so long as he can convince us that he's up-to-the-minute and
with
it.  I suppose that's why the action sequences are all underscored (and
undercut) by ghastly techno-trash for which, as is so often the case, Eric
Serra is to blame.<br /><br />Apart from the look and the feel there's nothing to talk about without
being
overcome by deep weariness.  The plot isn't hard to understand.  At least,
it's as easy to understand on the first viewing as it's ever going to get.
It will never make any sense.  Here's the central idea: once every five
thousand years comes a great evil that will destroy all life, ALL life, if
a
magic ceremony isn't performed.  The villain wants to stop the ceremony
from
being performed.  The phrase &quot;obscure motivation&quot; doesn't even begin to
describe this situation.  Does the villain want to die?  No.  Is he acting
in ignorance?  No.  Is there ANY way of making sense of his psychology?
No.<br /><br />If Besson had been content with a simple high-wire act of implausibility,
if
he'd been willing to let his central conceit rest unexplained, it MIGHT
have
worked.  But he tries to explain things and makes matters worse.  He can't
even come up with some decent sophistry.  Watch the first confrontation
between the priest and the villain while bearing in mind that both players
know that the future of all life is at stake.  The advanced student who
can
salvage some kind of point from this scene should then turn his attention
to
the mysterious actions performed by the priest (a different priest) in the
opening scene.  It's no use: there's no making sense of any of
it.<br /><br />So far I've been kind.  It's despicable as well as bad.  Anything so
soulless, that tries so hard to be hip and cynical, has no RIGHT to
attempt
such blatant emotional manipulation at the end.
