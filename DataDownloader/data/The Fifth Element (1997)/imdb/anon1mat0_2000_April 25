It's amazing that some people didn't like it!. Mmm, no, perhaps it is not
that amazing because the average American viewer is to dumb to understand
something different from the average. Yes, it has a lot of comedy but is at
the same time a very well done action movie, very high paced with awesome
dialogues and lots of surprises. Not for the weak, and certainly not for
the
dumb! It is a very good movie (as usual in Luc Besson) and deserves to be
seen carefully to catch all the details.
