1999_December 9 

This film is a Sci-Fi / Action extravaganza! Why it wasn't a box office
smash is beyond me.
The story line is different and the special effects are state of the art.
Even though Bruce Willis doesn't deliver his best performance he brings a
tough guy / soft guy element to the movie. The overtones of Adolf Hitler
portrayed with Gary Oldman has a slightly ridiculous feel about it and I
don't think are completely necessary. The costumes are designed by
Jean-Paul
Gaultier the famous fashion guru and are cat walk stuff with a cartoon
feel.
The action is fast and furious with loads of special effects that also
have
cartoon overtones, Judge Dredd the movie could have been like this.. if
only.
If you like Sci-Fi/Action films that don't take themselves too seriously
then I recommend getting it out on video/DVD, cranking your TV/Surround
sound up and enjoying an underrated movie.
