I loved this movie! It was quirky and cooky and full of hilarious
characters. Terry Gilliams visions are always great as I also loved
Brazil and his Monty Python stuff.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is the star of the movie but Milla Jovovich blows
everybody off the screen. She is funny, beautiful, and kicks butt as
The Fifth Element Leeloo. I can watch her over and over in this role.
The bright orange hair and the innocence she portrays is just unique
and also touching. The scene where she goes into Bruce Lee mode is
hilarious and fantastic.<br /><br />Also Chris Tucker has a break out role. And lastly I have no idea who
the Diva is or who was actually singing but it was beautiful.
