One of my all time favorite movies. I watch them all. From silent to up
to date. This is stunning in it&#39;s presentation. Beautifully
photographed and I&#39;ve seen it 12 times and will watch whenever it comes
on. Milla Was breath taking as Leelo. Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis.
Ian Holm was a great character in Father or the priest.Others were just
as good. Great make-up and great costumes. You could really believe it
was 300 years in the future. An excellent movie, I highly recommend it.
I rarely buy movies, but I bought this one. I would do it again. When
it comes on TV again I&#39;ll be there to watch it again. I would love to
see a sequel. Watch it and then see if it makes you feel good at the
end.
