While not the most advanced sci-film, nor the most action-packed
thrillride,
nor the gut-busting comedy, this film provides the best entertainment
value
I've come across.  The direction and editing are not soon to be
outclassed,
and I can't recall any movie to day which gives me more enjoyment with
each
viewing as this.
