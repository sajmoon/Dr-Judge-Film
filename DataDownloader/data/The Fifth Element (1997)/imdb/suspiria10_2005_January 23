Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich star in this wonderful sci-fi tale.
Chock full of killer performances and excellent effects.<br /><br />Korben Dallas is your average ordinary New York taxi driver. Fresh out
of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One
day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his
life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically
manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty
and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of
others will have to step up and help her save humanity.<br /><br />This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little
something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair
even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects,
romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting
music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name it&#133;this
film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best
science fiction films ever.<br /><br />I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it.
