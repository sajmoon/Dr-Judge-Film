I have seen this movie about 50 times and so has my friend. It only gets
better each time. Whats better then a crazy ex-marine that can use a 10 page
list of ships and weapons proficiently. Not to mention Mila Jovovich is
INSANELY hot. What more to ask for. Violent explosions saving the world and
some real HIGH QUALITY humor.
