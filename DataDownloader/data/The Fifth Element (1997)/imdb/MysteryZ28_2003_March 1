I remember renting this movie when it first came out on video for the
first
time at the age of 15 in 1997.  Being a movie buff and a sci-fi freak, the
movie looked interesting. Then I saw it...<br /><br />The second (Leeloo) Milla Jovovich appeared in the film, my heart dropped
to
my feet. Mere words couldn't describe what I was experiencing.  Milla was
simply the most beautiful creature my eyes had ever laid on. Milla Natasha
Jovovich was, is adorable.  I became a huge fan. The more research I did
on
her, the more I learned of her, I more I adored her.  I remember when
there
were only a hand full of us dedicated fans on the internet, but over the
last few years, her popularity has grown.  For years I was obsessed with
Milla, too obsessed for my own good.  Milla Jovovich and The Fifth Element
had a big affect on my life.<br /><br />Now I'm a 20 year old college student and still big fan of
Millas.<br /><br />The movie was great but Milla was better.  For me, she made the movie.
Although I will say that Luc Besson takes us to a different dimension, a
beautiful one to say the least.<br /><br />A great movie, an even greater soundtrack, and Millas in
it...<br /><br />
