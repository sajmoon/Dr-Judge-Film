quote, &quot;I LOVE THIS MOVIE&quot;. the Michael is a huge fan of not only Luc
Besson films, but a huge Milla Jovovich fan as well. the role of Leeloo
preformed by Milla made me cry a little inside. Or laugh. It depends on
which scene you&#39;re talking about.(But of coarse it&#39;s all masterful
acting). But what the Michael is saying is that this movie is an
excellent piece of art, that can be enjoyed any day, at any time. It
has everything, action, comedy, drama, Bruce Willis. EVERYTHING. So in
conclusion, BUY THIS MOVIE, because it is definitely one of those
movies that will never get old, no mater how many times you watch it.
Believe me. the Michael has spoken.
