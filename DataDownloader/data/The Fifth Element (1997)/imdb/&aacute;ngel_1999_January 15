1999_January 15 

Well, Luc, you know, the director, got something heavy in his mind. You can
see the monsters or Gary Oldman or even the plot. Including the
super-beautiful photography. But this film is something like a part of my
family. I love Mila Jvovich clothes and the transatlantic. La Diva
Plavalaguna's pretty, really. Maybe the wrong thing in this film is that it
wants to conquer north americans. That's a wrong desire. Luc should play it
only for [we] the aliens.
