This sci-fi fantasy had a lot of ingredients to be great, a wonderful
concept, Luc Besson who directed the brilliant Leon:The Professional
and Gary Oldman who is one of the best underrated actors working today
being just a few.<br /><br />The Fifth Element is a hugely imaginative and enjoyable film, with only
Chris Tucker&#x27;s annoying character and performance and the occasional
lack of flow in the plot being its sole drawbacks. I adored the concept
and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue.<br /><br />The script and satire are fun and slick, the visuals are breathtaking
and unusual especially the amazing Big Apple effects with honourable
mention to the camp trip to the resort planet Fhoston Paradise and
there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be
had.<br /><br />Besson&#x27;s direction is excellent, Eric Serra&#x27;s music is atmospheric and
jaunty and the characters are fun. As is the acting, Bruce Willis is
charismatic, Milla Jovovich is beautiful and Gary Oldman is the
personification of haute-couture corruption. In conclusion, a great
sci-fi fantasy. 9/10 Bethany Cox
