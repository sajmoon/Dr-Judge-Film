Forget water torture. Just leave this movie playing for a few days with
no way to turn it off. I had brought a small DVD player to work and
this movie just happened to be in it and I can safely say that is the
only possible reason I watched all of it. I had nothing else to watch.<br /><br />Someone walked in and said &quot;what&#39;s you watching?&quot; I said &quot;The Fifth
Element&quot; and he said &quot;man, that movie is f***ed up&quot;. That was an
understatement. It&#39;s not just boring; it&#39;s also very irritating. Who
ever did the casting must have been completely insane. The fact that
this thing even exits is a testament to the sad state of movie making.<br /><br />If you rent this, make sure you have a back-up plan.
