Now, you're looking at me and thinking, &quot;What the heck is wrong with you!
That movie was the stupidest thing I've ever seen!&quot; And you're right. The
plot is terrible and the sci-fi element weak as water. To confess, the
first
time I saw this movie, I LOATHED it. However, the trick to appreciating
this
flick is seeing it with the right eyes. It was marketed as a sci-fi
vehicle,
and that's all wrong! It's a cheese-ridden comedy of characters, and a
great
one!<br /><br />Sit back, relax, skip the first 10 minutes, and watch it again. You will
not
regret it.<br /><br />Fans of MST3K and Death Race 2000 should definitely appreciate this. Ruby
Rod will be a cult icon some day, take my word for it.
