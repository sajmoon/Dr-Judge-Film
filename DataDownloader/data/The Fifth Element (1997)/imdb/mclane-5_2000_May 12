I bought the 5th Element on the recommendation of a friend, how wrong he
was. The 5th Element is nonsense from start to finish. To cap it all of
there are Jean Paul Gautier's ridiculous costume designs.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are boring and un-involving and why on earth was
Chris Tucker, who is a decent actor wasted as the loud mouth radio
presenter. And as for Bruce Willis I don't know how he was roped into this
but I hope he regrets it.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie to anyone, I would not like them to be put
through the sheer torture of this movie, instead see 'The
Matrix'.
