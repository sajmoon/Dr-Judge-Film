2004_April 11 

Well I'm stuck in this evening and have a choice of the Patriot or the
Fifth
Element... I find myself stuck between a rock and a hard place. I picked
the
Fifth Element and was reminded of why I was so disappointed with this
movie,
I love Luc Besson's previous work but this is terrible. Gary Oldman's bad
accent, leaden script, the crappy special effects... lets hope the French
don't set the design agenda for the future (re: see through plastic skull
caps).
In the headlong rush to create a rich world full of novel concepts the
plot
is totally forgotten... a sorry case of content being sacrificed for
style.
