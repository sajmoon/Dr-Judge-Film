1998_September 1 

After seeing &quot;The 5th element&quot; I felt like I had entered into the twilight
zone.
Indeed, a lot of people liked this movie (see the IMDB ratings), which I can
't understand at all ! It seemed I didn't see the same movie !
The plot is made for less than 4 years old kids, especially in the very
end.
If you know something about cinema and want to see a good Besson's film,
then rent the &quot;Leon&quot; video !This one can't be compared to &quot;The 5th Element
&quot;
my opinion: 1/10
