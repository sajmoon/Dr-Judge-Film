1999_October 1 

I'm serious folks. And I'm serious about my sci-fi.<br /><br />Epic saga. Good guys. Bad guys. Special effects. It has all the regular
stuff-- all done very well.<br /><br />What elevates the movie is the fact that the director kept Bruce Willis
under control. Bruce has shown, like in Pulp Fiction, that he can be a very
good actor when he tones it down a bit-- not a lot, but enough so that he
is
not the center of the movie. BTW, I'm not a Bruce Willis fan.<br /><br />Also, the sci-fi &quot;alternate world&quot; consistancy is excellently done. Almost
none of the features of this alt world are explain how they work or why
they
came to be, everything makes sense. Nothing seems out of place and no one,
not once acts out of character, not once. A supreme achievement for a
sci-fi
movie.<br /><br />The characters, including the supporting cast are excellent. Each has some
quirky thing going and they all pull off their characters so well. Gary
Oldman's &quot;mercenary gun seller's&quot; pitch to prospective buyers is hilarious.<br /><br />All in all, it is great fun. Do not pass on seeing it on the big screen
(perhaps at a local campus?) if you ever get the chance, it is one of the
few sci-fi movies that is worth the ticket price (if not more) these
days.
