1998_October 19 

I have read all the other reviews on this page about this film, most of them
saying it is terrific, greatest movie ever, but in my mind, nothing could be
further from the truth.  I found this film to be a piece of garbage and
totally absurd.  Zorg is one of the stupidest villiais I have ever seen, and
this film doesn't amount to much.  The ending's OK, but the majority was
pure trash.  At the beginning, I was giving it a chance, despite how bad it
seemed, but throughout the absurdity of the film just kept growing.  Chris
Tucker's character is stupid, annoying, absurd, and unnecessary in this
movie, his screaming all the time still building on the absurdity.  After
Luc Besson's 'The Professional', which is a great film, and after seeing the
'Die Hard Trilogy', which are some of the best movies around, I had high
expectations because of the clashing of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson.  But
the film was horrid.  A very disappointing film that should be avoided at
all costs by everyone.
