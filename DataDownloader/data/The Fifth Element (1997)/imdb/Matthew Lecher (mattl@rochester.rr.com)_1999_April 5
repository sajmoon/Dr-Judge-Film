1999_April 5 

Not only did this movie have Techno music and Milla Jovovich (wow), but a
plot that I found a rare find. Unlike most action/adventure movies these
days, the protagonists had the upper hand the _entire time_. Not by much,
but still the upper hand. I liked that aspect of this movie
alot.
