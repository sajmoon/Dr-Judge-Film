I save the magic rating of &quot;10&quot;, unlike many of the lazy people who
ordinarily only vote 1 or 10, for two special occasions: 1) when a film
or TV series is so magically perfect in every way, it deserves nothing
less (i.e. Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs) or 2)
if the film I'm voting for is hugely underrated and needs a push in the
right direction. Luc Besson's science fiction &quot;misfire&quot; is one of those
wonderful, very underrated movies.<br /><br />Starring Bruce Willis and Chris Tucker, people could easily dismiss it
as garbage. But 5th Element is anything but garbage! Chris Tucker,
being the hugely annoying but somewhat funny comedian that he is, is
perfect in his role as the weird shemale radio celebrity Ruby Rod.
Bruce Willis, a very underrated actor who mainly is picked for movies
because of his body, is really good in this film as a cynical cab
driver who has to save the world while having a horrible relationship
with his mother.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich gives her best performance as the &quot;perfect being&quot;, a
human reincarnation, &quot;Leelo&quot;, of a dead alien, who is the key to the
plot of saving the world from the evil that is returning after 300
years. She is completely into her role and manages to be both sexy and
sweet.<br /><br />As for Gary Oldman... well, what can I say? Another of the criminally
underrated actors of today! having starred in movies like L&eacute;on, Dracula
and this film, and completely stolen the show in each of those, it's
very strange how he is reduced to starring in a five-minute role in the
newest Harry potter movie, while eye-candy talent-less &quot;actors&quot; like
Tom Cruise or Matt Damon get the leads in huge-budget major motion
pics.<br /><br />Oldman is, to put it mildly, PERFECT in his role. His thick American
accent in place, his insane make-up and clothes, and cool lines with
flawless delivery, make his character, the main villain Zorg, a
performance you will not forget in a long time.<br /><br />The 5th Element is not a super serious dark-fest like Batman Begins. as
the &quot;plot outline&quot; reads, Luc Besson's future is very bright and
colorful, and the film is more like a comedy than an epic. but what a
comedy! if you're looking for a great film starring excellent actors
and directed by one of the best directors EVER, see The 5th Element.
Now.<br /><br />10/10. It deserves a spot in the Top 250.
