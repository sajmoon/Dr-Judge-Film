I LOVE this movie... Such a great sci fi movie.. in the beginning, I found
to flash and &quot;odd&quot;.. But you know what, you watch it a few times, and your
eyes will open to the eye candy ( leelo's rubber outfit fer one thing.. mm)I
am a die hard Sci fi fan, and this thing makes me want to question the whole
Star Wars thing.. OMG.. It's got humour, violence, sweet eye candy...
Definite must see..
