This movie, which so many critics bashed, is a great sleeper of a film.
Chris Tucker, who wasn't famous for Rush Hour yet, carries the backbone
of
this movie.  His portrayal of Ruby Rhod was hilarious-almost pants
wetting.
You'll find yourself telling others of his scenes only to be interrupted
by
laughter.  The Diva sequence is magnificent.  Her voice is haunting;
allowing the viewer to be swept away, eyes closed, to some quiet place of
shifting shadows and silver.  The futuristic NY is believable, and the
cab
is sweet.  Gary Oldman's character is a lame and disturbing.  He seems
like
some badly dressed, limping, closet gay with a ridiculous accent.  The
Mangalores were more evil than him.  A better movie than most give
credit.
Kudos to the priest and Ruby Rhod, and LeeLoo-they are the true stars of
this sci-fi film.
