1999_December 12 

Let me start off by saying that The Fifth Element had to be one of the
greatest sci-fi movies ever made. In fact, I think that after the four Star
Wars movies this was the greatest movie ever. But that's just my
opinion.<br /><br />This movie takes place in the distant future where an evil corporation run
by a man(at least I think it was a man) named Zorg plots to find four stones
that contain the four elements, earth, air, fire, and water and a mysterious
fifth element that is in the form of a young woman. When they are brought
together it can create an unimaginable power. Then, the young woman falls in
the hands of a New York City cab driver. With the help of a priest and a
wierd disc jockey(which I think is like a Dennis Rodman of the future) they
try to save the world.<br /><br />This movie was great on many accounts including, good performances, great
digital design, and an interesting interpretation of the future. Willis was
cool and so was Oldman. <br /><br />If you want to see a good sci-fi flick or just a good movie check this one
out. 10/10<br /><br />
