Without a doubt well before its time. Although it was released in 1997,
it's special effects were astounding, even today. The cinematography is
fantastic, the score well-played, and the acting superb. It is a
excellent pretext to the Matrix, even hinting to the famous scene (come
here) when the 5th element was fighting the aliens. The action
sequences are not the most important parts of the film, in contrast to
an unfortunate number of films that are released nowadays. The
parallelism in the film is fantastic, with one scene connecting
perfectly with the next. Everything works together as it should; there
is simply nothing to criticize about it. Bruce Willis is a great
protagonist, controlling every scene while not holding the movie back.
