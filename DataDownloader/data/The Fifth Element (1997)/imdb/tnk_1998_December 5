1998_December 5 

When I went to see the 5th element, I thought it
was another missed attempt to make a french
sci-fi movie...I Was wrong !!!<br /><br />For the first time in history, a french team managed
to create a picture that could stand it against
the biggest US blockbusters. SFX, Cinematic design, thrill
fun, excellent music...all was in that movie.<br /><br />The result among the audience was clear : everyone
stood up at the end of the showed and applauded!<br /><br />The next day in school, everyone spoke about it.
Finally we did it! Our cinema was not anymore
a boring one! It was really like a revelation
for all of us !!! Thanks luc for that wonderful
cinematographic experience!
