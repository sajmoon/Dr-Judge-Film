1999_March 29 

The more you watch, the more you find.  Truly superb
film making and great acting.  Bruce plays an every-day
hero who manages to find himself in the right place
at the right time over and over--and manages to pull
off some superb action sequences.  Milla is great,
Chris Tucker is very funny (totally makes the movie),
and the rest of the cast is terrific.<br /><br />Rent it and enjoy!
