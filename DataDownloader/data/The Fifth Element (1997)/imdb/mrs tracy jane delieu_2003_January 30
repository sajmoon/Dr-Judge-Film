For a Bruce Willis film this tells a good story of Love &amp; good conquoring
evil, with Bruce being the hero! Actually he plays a good role, like in 12
monkeys! Jean Paul Gautiez's fashion reigns through out, excellent
costumes!..(&amp; perfume)&amp; Who ever plays the 5th element, sorry I cant
remember her name, anyhow she is one of the best actors in the world!
