There are very few movies that are just brilliant period. This is one
of them. This jigsaw of a movie has parts that fit perfectly one after
another. Eric Serra&#39;s excellent soundtrack, great writing, stunning
visuals and special effects and great acting make for a movie you can
just sit in front of and enjoy. The casting is spot on from Willis&#39;s
Korbin Dallas to Tiny Lister&#39;s President. There are so many inside
jokes that you will be finding something new each time you watch it.
The sheer beauty of some of the vista&#39;s the movie is set in go from
gritty city to a god&#39;s eye view of a world in the background during a
stage event. Two things you will take with you in your mind&#39;s eye at
least: Plava Laguna&#39;s performance and the &quot;Jewish&quot; mother&#39;s annoying
phone calls where ever Korbin goes! I love technology!
