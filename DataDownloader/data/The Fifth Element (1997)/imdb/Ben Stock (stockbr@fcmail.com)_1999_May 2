1999_May 2 

See this movie. See it for the dazzling special effects, the action and
the
humour. The Fifth Element has everything you could want in a movie, and
even
though it's fairly long you will not be bored. I have seen it a number of
times and I am far from being tired of it, it's one of my favourite movies
of all time. I hope you see it so it can become one of yours as
well.
