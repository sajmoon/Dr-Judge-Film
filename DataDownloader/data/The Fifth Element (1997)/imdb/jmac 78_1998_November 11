WELL, I CANT SAY IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN, BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT. THE
SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT, BUT THE STORYLINE WASN'T ALL THAT CONVINCING. I
ADMIT IT DID TAKE ME 3 TIMES TO WATCH TO REALLY GET THE GIST OF WHAT THE
MAIN IDEA WAS, BUT I WAS OPEN FOR NEW EXPERIENCES. BRUCE WILLIS WAS
BASICALLY THE REASON THIS MOVIE MADE THE MONEY IT DID. PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE
HIM, NOT THE FLYING TAXI IN THE SKY. THE FUTURISTIC APPROACH WAS GREAT
,A LITTLE OVER-DRAMATIZED, BUT THATs WHAT MOVIES TRY TO DO.I GIVE THIS MOVIE
A 2.5, IT REALLY HAD NO STRONG PLOT THAT MADE ME INTERESTED IN THE MOVIE,.
SORRY FIFTH ELEMENT FANS.(dpags)
