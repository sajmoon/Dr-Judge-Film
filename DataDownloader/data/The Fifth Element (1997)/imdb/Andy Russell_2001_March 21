Lots of good stuff to enthuse over: effects, costumes, the cigarettes with
the extra-long filters, and best of all, the futuristic traffic network.
The movie looks fantastic.  Bruce Willis as the poorly dressed
Joe-who-saves-the-world, okay, cool...Yet, the story as a whole didn't
really work for me.  I did find it hard to swallow the concept that the
&quot;good&quot; aliens, who can kill you with a glance, have what is frankly a flimsy
spaceship.  The two Gamorrean Guards in the Battlestar Galactica Vipers
managed to destroy that without much hassle.  That the Gamorrean Guards turn
out to be pretty fragile themselves is another plot hole that undermined my
enjoyment.<br /><br />Still, if you like high-concept, go right ahead and disable your brain for a
couple of hours and enjoy.  But in the end it joins the legion of similar
visually brilliant movies that are ultimately forgettable.  For me,
anyway.;) 6/10
