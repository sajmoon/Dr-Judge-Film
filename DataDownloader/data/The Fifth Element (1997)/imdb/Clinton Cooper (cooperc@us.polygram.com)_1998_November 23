1998_November 23 

How could a genuine film fan enjoy this movie?  Reportedly, Luc Besson began
writing it when he was only sixteen.  He must have finished it before he
turned seventeen, because &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is one of the most immature
and annoying movies I can remember.  What story there is becomes
mind-numbingly dull by the end, but before that point, Besson heaps so much
half-witted, pseudo-intellectual garbage on the audience that it made me
want to scream.  I've heard some people excuse the lack of any logic or
reason in the plot by saying, &quot;Well, it's a sci-fi film, you know?!&quot;  My
response is that the best science-fiction novels and films have their basis
in physics, biology, etc... and are usually meticulously structured and well
thought out.  Besson seems to have based &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; in his typical
sophomoric tendency of making style tantamount to substance.  However, I
will say that the acting of Milla Jovovich was quite strong and Bruce Willis
wasn't bad either.  One last knock against the film: it unleashed the
unbearable Chris Tucker on the world!!!
