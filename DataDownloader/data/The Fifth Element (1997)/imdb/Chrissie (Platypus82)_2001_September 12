If I had to write a one-line review, it would say: SEE THIS
MOVIE.
It is my absolute all-time favorite movie and after seeing garbage like JP3
it's positively refreshing to pop in a good video like
this.
It's the perfect mix of
science-fiction/romance/comedy/parody/fantasy/action.
The story, definitely from the realm of sci-fi/fantasy, is told in a
suspenseful, grabbing way. Special effects are spectacular. What keeps
grabbing me are the opening sequences, especially when I got the stereo and
the subwoofer hooked to the VCR. Then we see twenty-third century
McDonald's
employees in costumes that might suggest we are watching a parody of a
sci-fi movie. Milla Jovovich as Leeloo appears and opens the romance
section
of this film. Bruce Willis gets some of his usual action scenes, but the
role has a lot more depth than your run-of the mill action movie hero. They
both deliver some superb acting. Throw Ruby Rhod into the mix and you get a
totally colorful, strange depiction of our future, but still the movie
manages to get back into the &quot;Movies To Be Taken Seriously&quot; department
towards the end.
This movie has suspense, has laughs, has feasts for the eye, has dialogue,
a
story and superb acting by Willis, Jovovich, the ingenious Gary Oldman, Ian
Holm, and of course, whats-his-name Rhuby Rhod. The soundtrack is also
great, especially the singing performance by Inva Mulla Tchako (the Diva
from the movie, the actress is not the one who sang though) which was
probably aided digitally a little. Towards the end we have a
hardcore-Kleenex scene...*sniff*...love saves the world despite all
evil...but the ending scene is a lot less melancholic and philosophical.
*grins* You'll see what I mean.
The director is also to be commended, cause transitions from one scene to
another are perfect. (Examples are to be found during the shuttle's liftoff
or when the countdown arrives at &quot;10&quot;).
Watch this movie. It's great. 10/10.
