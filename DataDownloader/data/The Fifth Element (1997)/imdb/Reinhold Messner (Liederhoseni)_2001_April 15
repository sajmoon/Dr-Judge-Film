I think its fairly danged obvious that this film was not made to be taken
seriously.  It certainly doesn't take itself seriously.  It's just a fun
movie.  The Anti-Blade Runner, if you will.  Does every science fiction
movie have to suffer the endlessly pointless scrutiny of a thousand Star
Trek fans and somebody who has read a physics book?<br /><br />Certainly, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, and it probably won't be
showing up on any AFI lists, but there are some times whenever I don't want
to watch Citizen Kane or even Brazil, but just an entertaining little
flick.
