After the 'Ultimate weapon' Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) escapes from
government captivity falling into the taxi of Corben Dallas (Bruce
Willis), she pleads for his help, which he hesitantly gives. They're
not only chased by the military but by Zorg (Gary Olman) who has linked
himself with Evil and plans to get 4 stones that Leeloo needs to save
the universe, but for less altruistic reasons then her. What follows is
a great action packed movie. Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod is pretty
annoying at times, but it isn't as much so as to aversely affect my
accolades for the film. All the primary actors are great, the action
set pieces are a blast and the computer generated scenery is much more
appealing then the one's found in Star Wars: Episodes 1 and 2. While it
may not be my favorite Luc Besson film (That high honor goes to Leon),
it still is a fun ride.<br /><br />My Grade: B <br /><br />2-DVD set Extras: Disc 1) A fact track <br /><br />Disc 2) 6 featurettes ( Visual, Digital, star, Alien, Fashion, and the
