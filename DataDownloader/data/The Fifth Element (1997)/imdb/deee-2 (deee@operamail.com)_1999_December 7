1999_December 7 

I've seen this piece several times before i decided on commenting on it. The
reason was the everlasting energy the movie encloses. As all of the Luc
Besson masterpieces it is a movie I could see twice in a row and would not
get bored of it. 
Bruce Willis in a typical role full of cool phrases of a stoic sweet hearted
killer and Milla as the perfect woman manage to save the world once again.
Additional BRAVO to Mr. Oldman. 
If you like Luc Besson or Bruce Willis or Gary Oldman or Action or Fun or
good music, you absolutely have to see this movie!!<br /><br />PS:The soundtrack does not lack any of the brilliance of the movie itself.
