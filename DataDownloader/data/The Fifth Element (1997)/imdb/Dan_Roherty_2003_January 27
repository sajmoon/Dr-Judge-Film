I know I am late, but this movie left me in my seat the whole time. It was
suspenseful and great special effects. It was one movie that will keep you
in your seat for the whole time and you won't blink at all. Now this is
just
my opinion of course. I am speaking only for myself, but I would say that
that movie was one of the greatest movies I have seen since...for a great
amount of time. I hope that you will take this vote and comment into
consideration. I believe that with The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry
Potter, etc. that this one is in this category. Sci-Fi, Funny, Action,
Adventure. That is what a good movie is all about. The humor and the
action
within the movie. Well...Thanks for letting me put my opinion out! I
guarantee that those who have not seen it (Which I doubt aren't that much)
will enjoy it time and time again.
