I just don&#39;t understand why this movie could have such a good rating.
The plot totally sucks, and there is nothing in the movie that makes
sense. People act abnormally e.g. how in that time security obviously
SUCKS, so anyone can act like Korben Dallas and get on a plane to a far
off planet.<br /><br />I don&#39;t even want to waste anymore time writing this REVIEW. I want 1&frac12;
hours of my life back that I wasted on this movie TWICE.<br /><br />I guess the reason I saw it twice, was because I truly could NOT
believe how much this movie really sucked. WAKE UP PEOPLE. The rating
on this movie proves the below average intelligence of the human race.
