The 5th Element is like nothing I have ever seen before. It has the kind
of
vision one would associate with Tim Burton of Terry Gilliam but only with
colour. It is the opposite of every Bruce Willis, action or futuristic
movie
cliche you have ever heard of. The set designs and characters are all over
the top, Jean-Paul Gautier did the costumes and the action scenes are set
to
opera and gypsy kings like music. Most of the people I have spoken to
about
this film either love it or hate it there are no in betweens watch it with
an open mind and you will love it.
