With an outrageous story line, terrific characterization and a set design
straight out of a Moebius comic this is one wild ride. Vastly
underappreciated when released, this is a film that should be taken for
what
it is - tongue-in-cheek, wickedly funny and loud. Director Luc Besson seems
to take great delight in twisting (Hollywood) film conventions and that's
part of the charm here. Even Bruce Willis seems to have a lot of fun doing
Bruce Willis.
