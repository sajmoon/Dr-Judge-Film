1998_August 16 

You can tell by watching this movie that a lot of work was put into it(it
costs $90 million). But the story, like many furture movies, is rediculous.
Also, the pacing is very slow. There are only two good parts in the movie.
A little editing, and some better writing would have done this movie some
good, instead of what we end up with.
