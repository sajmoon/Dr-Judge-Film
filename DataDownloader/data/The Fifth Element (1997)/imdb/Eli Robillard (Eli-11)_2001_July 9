A friend wrote this: I liked Fifth Element only because of its excess.  A good comparison
is Water World.  When the French blow 200 million dollars, you get a
crappy film with a lot of style (great clothes), beautiful expansive scnenery
and some kind of cool music.  When the American blow 200 million, you get
Kevin Costner.  <br /><br />My reply: I actually liked Fifth Element until around Jovavitch's big fight
scene. Suddenly the film took a left turn, lost whatever focus on style it
had, and became an embarrassment on the level of Tank Girl.<br /><br />Chris Tucker was fine for his first scene. But to keep him on screen for
more than five minutes was a huge mistake that derailed the movie. Father of
the Bride did it right with Martin Short as the wedding planner -- five
minutes then out. If the performance sucks then no harm no foul. Every
second past that is unpaid overtime. <br /><br />That whole last third from the departure to the fantasy planet onwards was
as though Besson said &quot; I can't make up my mind between sci fi and forced
camp.&quot; If there's a hell below intentional camp I'd like to know what it is.
It began subtly with the jewish mother jokes and the General's crew stuffed
in the freezer, by the fight scene it was outta control. Bruce Willis had a
great action sequence, overshadowed by Tucker's shrill-bitch running
commentary. He's not saving the world anymore, he's saving the girly-man
from burping aliens. <br /><br />Like fake boobs, you get less pleasure staring at them right after watching
the operation. Not only is it false advertising, but now you know you're
being taken for a sucker. I kept watching with the hope Tucker would drop
out of sight or a plot twist might keep it interesting, but got the feeling
by the end that the Besso didn't give a damn anymore either.<br /><br />
