This movie could have been pretty good if Chris Tucker had been left
out of it! For some unknown reason Chris Tucker was inserted into the
movie as an extremely annoying and whining radio personality who
follows the hero of the movie around for a very lengthy portion of the
movie. Not only is Chris Tucker not funny but he is so loud and
irritating that he actually kept me from enjoying the movie every time
he screamed his ridiculously bad lines. If Chris Tucker had been in the
movie just briefly then the movie might have survived his terrible
performance. However, since Chris Tucker was kept in the movie for so
long it, his character has an enduring negative presence that subtracts
a significant amount of enjoyment from the movie.
