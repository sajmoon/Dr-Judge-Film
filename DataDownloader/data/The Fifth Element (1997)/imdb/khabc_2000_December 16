hello again<br /><br />i have seen the fifth element quite a few times ,but i never stop enjoying
seeing it. The futuristic movie has the traditional storyline:&quot;saving the
planet&quot; , but it is well made.<br /><br />Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are great together. The catchy thing about
this movie is the concept of &quot;Supreme Being&quot;.  The role is well portrayed
by
Milla.The movie is also good for sci-fi lovers (cars moving in air, food
supplied in air by a small boat ,etc.).<br /><br />the picturisation of the movie is good.<br /><br />Its a must see movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!!<br /><br />khabc
