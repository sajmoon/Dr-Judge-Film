Luc Besson had made some great films Leon being one the best film made.
However what has happened to his directing skills on the 5th element.  The
story is based in the future where only the 5th element can save the world
from Evil forces destroying life. This has happens every five thousand
years.  The film its self has some great special effects and the story line
gets you're interested.  However the sad thing is Luc Besson insists on
making the 5th element an action comedy which just does not work.  Chris
Tucker who plays the DJ just spoils the film for me and the whole result is
a waste of time.  If only Luc Besson based the project on a seriously
format
it could have been a classic but chose to do the old style of trying to
make
this film more of a action comedy  which just does not work.
