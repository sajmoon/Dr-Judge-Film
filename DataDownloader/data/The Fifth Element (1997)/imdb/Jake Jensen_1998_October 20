1998_October 20 

When the movie was released in theatre, I was working there at the
time.  The previews said, &quot;Comparable to Star Wars!&quot;  The only thing that
went through my mind as I was in the seat watching the flick was, &quot;They had
the nerve to compare this to Star Wars!?!&quot;
Most of my friends don't agree with me about Fifth Element being the
worst movie ever made, but that just doesn't change my mind.  The plot had
unbelievable holes, the badly-done special effects were just stuck on for
popularity, and the most unfunny Chris Tucker just annoyed the heck out of
me.  I was almost ready to leave the theatre!  But don't listen to me,
however.  You can rent it for yourself and see :)
