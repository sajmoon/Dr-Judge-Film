I think it was one great movie.... I love a good SCI-FI flick, and this
one
is great....  I am a large Bruce Willis fan, and I like the whole plot
line
on this one.... its very unique.   I truly believe it could be a cult
classic...  there are movies out there that you can see once, then the
surprise hits you at the end of the movie, then, theres no point in
watching
the movie again.... In this movie, you can watch it a number of times, and
be entertained every time!
