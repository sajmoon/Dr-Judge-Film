1999_May 17 

After watching this movie, I can only say I am disappointed.  The only
redeeming moments are with Leeloo (the 5th element) and Cornelius (the
priest).  How do you act when your god and your savior appears in your
apartment in the flesh and she is nothing like you ever expected?  Ian
Holm
played the part very well.  The rest of the movie is beautiful
garbage.
