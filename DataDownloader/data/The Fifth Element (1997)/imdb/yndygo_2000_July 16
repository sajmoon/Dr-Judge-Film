I must differ entirely with the other comment I read posted here... This is
one of the few movies I've ever bothered to purchase -- because it's one of
the few movies I can watch on a weekly basis, and still get completely
wrapped up in...
Cheesy? yes.  Predictable? yes.  You could even say it's formulaic... But
it's beautiful!  Divinely comic performances by the actors, lines that bear
repeating amongst friends in the know, and a beautiful melange of color,
music, and special effects.  It's not a serious, sit-down and contemplate
the moral message movie...it's an adventure with good guys, bad guys,
aliens, and comic-relief-sidekicks... and it even contains the patented
&quot;Bruce-Willis-jumping-through-the-air-screaming-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh&quot;
yell...
Too much fun!
