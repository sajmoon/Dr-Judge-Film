The 5th Element	B/A				3.24.00		2.35:1/5.1
	First Viewing		Anamorphic Widescreen<br /><br />I had seen several reviews about the reference quality of this disc so I
held out on watching it until the new TV arrived.  It was worth waiting for:
 the special effects are for the most part amazing and the action never lets
up.  The sound is even better!  The story itself is little better than Dark
City (similar actually) but the joy of being involved in it all makes up for
it.  The DVD doesn't include any extras, or it surely would have been an
A+.
