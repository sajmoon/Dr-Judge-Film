OK, This film can be called stupid, Silly, And foolish! Still, I think
It is one of the best films of the past few years. You can tell the
Movie does not take itself seriously,which is better than films that
try too hard. This Film is what movies are all about, Entertainment!
The characters are borrowed from many Sci-Fi epics and twisted in a
delicious way. The Plot has many sub plots working and is as twisted as
the characters. Chris Rock as Ruby Rhod Is Hilarious, Gary Oldman is
Terrific as the Villain, Bruce Willis Makes a Reluctant Hero. Milla, Ah
what can we say about Milla, Child-like and Innocent, She carries the
movie, What a beauty. I bought this movie and watched it many times,
Pure Entertainment. I gave it an 8
