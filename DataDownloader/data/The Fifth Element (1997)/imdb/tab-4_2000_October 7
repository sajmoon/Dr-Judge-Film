This movie has it all. Well...at least all it needs to be the movie it's
supposed to be. It's not an deep dark futuristic sci-fi like many other
great sci-fi flick's, it's the exact opposite!
It's just plain fun, and everything is executed so very beautifully.
Visuals/Actors/Audio....all superb, but the one thing that really make this
movie something very special is the editing! 
It is so well done...I cant praise the editors enough.
Thanks!!
