The 5th Element is my favorite movie of all time. There is not one
aspect of the movie that I don't like. Every detail of the movie has
been carefully constructed to form the most fun and entertaining movie
possible. I understand that this movie is not The Godfather and does
not embody some of the values that those who deem themselves movie
critics appreciate. However, a lot of hard, smart, dedicated work went
into this movie and I do not think that it gets the credit it deserves.
Look at the trivia section that IMDb provides for a sampling of the
detail that went into this movie. It has a great plot, especially
considering that all of the action takes place in one day. The
soundtrack is amazing, the characters are great. And how cool is it
that throughout the entire movie, the bad guy (Zorg) and the hero
(Korben Dallas) never meet? And the movie was edited in an amazing way.
I have seen thousands of movies from every genre and have a favorite
movies list from here to Timbuktu, and The 5th Element is at the top of
my list. It will always be one of my all-time favorites and it will
always have a special place in my heart. It just makes me happy no
matter what.
