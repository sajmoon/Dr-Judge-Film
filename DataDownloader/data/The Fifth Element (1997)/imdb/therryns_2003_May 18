My husband and I are still laughing at this lightweight scifi flick with
unforgettable moments. Opera fans still shriek with delight at the Blue
Lady, and fast food addicts dream of having Chinese joints float past
their
windows. The plot isn't much, the acting has its moments but not much
more,
but it's still one we recommend to friends and will rent if nothing else
on
our list is available. Don't expect much, and you'll enjoy yourself. A lot
of its elements, fifth or not, continue to appear in other scifi, and you
may yet find yourself quoting effects if not the script. One of those
inexplicable favorites, and more than worth a try.
