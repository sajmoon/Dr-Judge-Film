The bright points of this movie:  The future New York (if they'd never
left
it, if the entire movie took place there and explored it more...I would
love
this movie.  It would be the most awesome film in history)<br /><br />Ian Holm's character was pretty entertaining at times.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I must admit, though, the visuals for the city make it worth it to watch
at
least the first half of this movie.<br /><br />The dark points:  Gary Oldman's cardboard-cutout character...more than
the
look, THIS is what makes it seem like a saturday morning cartoon.<br /><br />The muddled mess of a plot...patched together from two scripts and boy
does
it ever show.<br /><br />Chris Tucker.  I have not seen anything to make me understand this guy's
popularity.  People saying he's at his best here makes me not want to.
His
character is absolutely GRATING.  Cheezy in a bad way.<br /><br />The entire second half of the movie<br /><br />The cheezy bull***t that makes up the premise of the major parts of the
plot
(the egyptian connection, the evil thingy going to destroy the
world)<br /><br />I can't think of any reason to see it except the city, really.  But that
is
enough.  Just press stop once they leave it.
