1999_April 6 

This movie was all about fun.  Some people who voted a 3 for this movie
did
not realize this.  The best clue that Besson wanted the movie to be fun is
the music, it's always playful.  I thought that that most aspects of the
film were well thought out.  Be warned though this is SCIENCE FICTION
movie
and if you are like Frank Wheeler it might be too much for you to swallow
an
earth who's future is not dreary like most other Sci-Fi movies.
