Sorry, I just don't get it.  How ANYONE could enjoy this movie is beyond
me,
and I'm a Bruce Willis fan!  Only the 3rd movie I ever walked out on but
I
had better things to do (watch grass grow, change the lint filter in the
dryer, etc.).  My condolences if you paid full theater prices to sit
through
this bomb!
