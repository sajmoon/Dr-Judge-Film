1999_August 12 

I remember first seeing this movie.  I was excited because this was a Luc
Besson film.  I mean Luc Besson changed my view on movies with Leon (aka
Professional).  I used to just watch movies and enjoy them, but by the end
of Leon I was literally crying, and I've never really been the same.  The
5th Element doesn't exactly possess the quality to produce tears, but the
story line and characters are just simply fun to watch.  Eric Serra, the
composer for the film who usually works with Luc Besson, did an incredible
job with this soundtrack too.  I mean not the kinda stuff you would pump
up
in your car, but listen to it in the movie and in it's context, it really
is
amazing.  Eric Serra has a great gift and so does Luc, so put em together,
and you have got a good movie at least.  This film just takes a lil
imagination, it's not just an action, or a romance, it's mostly everything
just blended together.  See this if ya get the chance, and get hooked on
Luc
Besson, he really does have a genius to his work.
