There is a certain Luc Besson feel about this eye-candy you can also
find in the &quot;Taxi&quot; - series, &quot;Leon&quot;, &quot;Nikita&quot; and others, that is
distinct compared to the movies that are being produced in Hollywood in
our days. The humor is quite distinct as it has a certain
french/subtle/European sophistication, and story-wise his movies have a
certain fill(complexity) you will not find in their American
counterparts.The story unfolds fluently, even if not always
realistic(not necessary in a sci-fi blockbuster)and the many complex
story lines will converge to deliver the maximum effect(Besson has
specialized in action movies, as a writer and as a director).<br /><br />Visually the movie has the same complex texture, beautiful set design,
fantastic costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and the extraordinary
graphic designs of Dan Weil(production designer). Colours are lavishly
displayed as the cinematic eye takes you on a visual feast, accompanied
by an extraordinary soundtrack(a special mention to the techno-opera
recital).<br /><br />Great supporting acting by Gary Oldman, Ian Holm and Chris Tucker.<br /><br />I only hope America will allow in a distant future the cultural
diversity to be celebrated as here and not as it is choked in our days.
