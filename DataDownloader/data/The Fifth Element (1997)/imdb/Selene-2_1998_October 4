1998_October 4 

I've never been a huge fan of science fiction, so I watched this movie for
the first time simply to spite a friend who said I'd like it.  I was proven
wrong.  Not only is the Fifth Element visually stunning, it is very well
presented in general.  Bruce Willis does a wonderful job as the hero, and
Gary Oldman is just...well...AMAZING!!!  I definitely think it takes a
special kind of actress to do what Milla Jovovitch did with the &quot;divine
language,&quot; totally disproving what I had thought of her after &quot;Return to the
Blue Lagoon.&quot;  This is a great movie!
