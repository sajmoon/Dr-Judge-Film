I love Bruce Willis since I've seen this movie.And,it's the work of Luc
Besson,who is one of my favorite director.<br /><br />Some people think,this film is nothing but a Fran-wood(France produce
movies in a Hollywood style).See?Hero of our planet who is
single,handsome,cool,brave.Story occurs in future,and,especially in
NYC.There must have the evil side who just want to eliminate life.There
also has the good,light side from out-space who have the only weapon to
against the Evil side.And,don't forget the beautiful girl,she'll be the
key -- she is the one who can save the world.Meantime,she falls in love
with our hero.<br /><br />Bruce is the only one to perform this movie.So he acted Korben Dallas
when he was already 42 year-old.Can you image?Milla(who acted
Leeloo,the beautiful girl and the hero's lover)was 22 then.They were
together,but I feel well~~Bruce,were you really 42 year-old in
1997?Maybe you were just 32! The story line was weak.Just about,the
scientists re-created the fifth element-Leeloo,she needed to find the
priest and use the four stones to protect our peaceful
planet.Korben(stars by Bruce)met her in a car accident,then Korben also
received a mission to find the stones.<br /><br />Ridiculous,the stones were taken by a alien singer-Diva who would give
a show in another planet - so-called Paradise,and the tickets had
already been sold out,only way to there was to be the winner of the
Paradise's one contest...OK...three sides tried their
best,Priest,Korben and,Zorg,the representer of the Evil.I was just
confused...Can they use some so-called spaceship to get there? After
all,the vision effect is very very wonderful,and so is the BGM.I like
the ending song-A Little Light of Love.Ending?No question to ask!The
hero and the girl will surely save the world,mission completed,everyone
is cheering!But where are our heroes?...<br /><br />Milla was orange-hair,spoke so-called divine language,wore less,though
Korben in film describes her as '5'9&quot;,blue eyes,long legs,great skin',I
just want to say,Milla,wear more,you have a perfect figure,but is it
necessary to show it entirely to us?
