This is one of the best movies I own. The DVD is reference quality for
home theater video and sound, and truly entertaining to boot. I never
get tired of the movie and love everyone's performances, particularly
Gary Oldman as Zorg. I think the special effects were ahead of its
peers for the time the movie was produced. <br /><br />I cannot believe the relatively low rating this movie has received. It
is unlike any other sci-fi/adventure/comedy movie I have seen to date.
I wish they would make a sequel for it. Ah well... it would probably
never be as good.<br /><br />Kudos to everyone involved in the creation of this fantastic yarn for a
job well done. Sound, musical score, cinematography, acting, costuming,
set design, special effects, etc. etc. etc.
