This is an appalling movie! I cannot understand how so many people think
it
is so great. It is rare that I do not finish watching a movie. Hey i even
watched Ishtar to its conclusion, but this piece of tripe I could not
stomach.<br /><br />What is wrong with it you ask? Better to ask what is right with it. That
is
easier to answer: nothing. And I am a Bruce Willis fan
too!
