  I can guarantee that almost anyone will appreciate this movie for what it
is once they have watched it at least two times.  If you look through the
comments, most people had a misconception as to what this was about.  The
first time I saw it I was going to see it because of Willis because I
expected a solid action movie.  It is that, but much more.<br /><br />  This movie has a very good tempo to it; there are hundreds of minor things
that can be missed that are self-mocking or intentional puns on other
popular sci-fi movies.  It ranges from serious to comedic, but only rarely
goes too far off track (only instance I remember is the final scene before
they land in Egypt w/ the nuke).<br /><br />  Don't assume the acting is over-the-top or that the movie will be what you
expect.  Everything falls into place once you see the bigger picture.  This
is definitely one of my all-time favorites, especially for a genre that is
seriously lacking.
