Will anyone want to believe that this movie was actually being used
indirectly once for one of my Art lessons back then in my school days
some years back?<br /><br />Our Art teacher actually showed us this movie and we had to watch to
get ideas. Though in the end I don&#39;t get too much &#39;insipiration&#39; out of
it, I still enjoyed the movie anyway.<br /><br />It&#39;s only very much later on I realised this was directed by one of
France&#39;s acclaimed directors Luc Besson. No wonder! Though I may not
really understand much what was really happening in the movie half the
time, I like that it looks so futuristic. But maybe given science
fiction is not really one of those genres which is up my alley, it&#39;s a
little of a pity though now I think of it.<br /><br />The music, the colour, the people...really like, wow in the movie.
