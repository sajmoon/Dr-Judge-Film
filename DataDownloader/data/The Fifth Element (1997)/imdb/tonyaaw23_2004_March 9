I saw this movie for the first time going home on the bus from school back
in 1998. I became such a fan and I've seen it probably 20 times since then.
Chris Tucker is funny as he!! in this movie, Bruce Willis is very sexy and
also got to show his comedic side. The girl who played Lilo played her with
such innocence that it was very easy to root for her. <br /><br />My all time favorite scenes in The Fifth Element were when Lilo beat all of
those weirdos up as the Diva was singing. The part when she's dancing and
saying &quot;huh huh....&quot; is so much fun to watch. <br /><br />I've memorized most of this movie and I always adore at the end when they do
the elements and Lilo is the 5th Element. Zeus as the president was a genius
decision. He was very convincing and so funny especially at the end when he
was arguing with his mother. <br /><br />I would recommend The Fifth Element to anyone who likes futuristic stuff,
comedy, drama, action and romance. The villain in the movie is also a scene
stealer, he's just hilarious.
