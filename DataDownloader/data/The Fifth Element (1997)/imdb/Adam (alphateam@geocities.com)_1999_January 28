1999_January 28 

This movie was stunning. The special effects were great and the story was
top notch. On a basic level it was just good winning over evil, but it was
great none the less. A stunning performance by Milla Jovovich and Bruce
Willis. Luc Besson is one of the great action directors of the 90's. We can
only hope that other Sci-Fi movies can be as good.
