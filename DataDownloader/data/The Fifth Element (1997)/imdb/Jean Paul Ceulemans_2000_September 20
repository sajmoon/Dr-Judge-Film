2000_September 20 

With its wonderful mix of genres, I would almost be tempted to describe it
as a noir-scifi-comedy.<br /><br />This is really one of these rarer movies I watch once a year and it still
keeps getting better. It is a real feast for the eye and ear, but it must be
enjoyed in a movie theater or at least in a very good home theater.<br /><br />And although the storyline itself is paper thin, the atmosphere it creates
is so enchanting that I could not resist giving this movie a straight 10.
