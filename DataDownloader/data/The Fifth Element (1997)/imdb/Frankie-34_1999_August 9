I really enjoyed this movie. Luc Besson weaves an almost magical tale of a
cabdriver (Korben Dallas-Willis) who inadvertently picks up an alien
(Leeloo-Jovovich) who holds the key to saving the world from the ultimate
evil, all set against a bright, busy and futuristic backdrop. Milla
Jovovich
shines as Leeloo and Bruce Willis pulls it all together with his perfect
portrayal of tough-but-soft Korben Dallas. If anything, see this movie for
it's wonderful special effects and to pick up quite a few funny quotes
from
Leeloo.
