2000_January 4 

When I first saw The Fifth Element, I was confused within the first thirty
minutes. Some of these things were explained later in the movie, but I
watched it a second time just to make sure I didn't miss something. The
second time around, it wasn't as confusing because I knew what to expect,
but it wasn't much more enjoyable.<br /><br />It seemed like every time Luc Besson tried to insert a little gag or pun,
instead of adding comedy relief it just opened new holes in the story that
were never explained. I'd find myself saying &quot;Wait, what happened to...&quot;
or
&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; I guess, since this is sci-fi, we're just
supposed to laugh and fill in the gaps ourselves, but I found it rather
annoying. Speaking of annoying, I don't even need to elaborate on the
character of Ruby Rhod, who--by the way--simply walks out of the pyramid
at
the end of the movie, presumably to a slow, fiery death (there I go
filling
in the gaps on my own).<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of science fiction anyway, but there are some sci-fi's
that I like. The Fifth Element, however, does not make my
list.
