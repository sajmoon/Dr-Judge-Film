2004_February 3 

I loved it.  I have seen it about 10 times.  The sheer random absurdity
and
the wacked way that the characters deal with the bizarre situations they
find themselves in really appealed to my sense of the bizarre.  The story
is
not exactly War and Peace, but it really doesn't need to be.  It's more
about the amazing visual spectacle, and the really weird people, and
watching veteran scene stealer Gary Oldman have a ball than anything else.
Bruce Willis does quite a good job in a silly hero spot, and the giant
metal
turkeys do a good job too, in their underwritten but crucial roles.  It's
really the throwaway moments that are the best in this.  I think one of my
favorite moments is the juiced thief with a picture of the hallway on his
head breaking into a bizarre dance, but one cannot discount the cockroach
with the camera, the frozen military personnel (Hail, Replicant!), and the
little elephant animal thingy.  I never cease to be amused by Chris
Tucker's
amazing Ruuuuuuby Rhod!  And the opera diva!  And those weird and
none-to-bright aliens with the big ears!  And the deaf pop star!
Explosions!  A race to save the world!  And true love!  Who could ask for
anything more?  I find the whole thing to be compulsively watchable.
