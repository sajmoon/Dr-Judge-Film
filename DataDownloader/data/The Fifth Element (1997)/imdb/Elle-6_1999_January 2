How can you not like this movie!
It's the complete sci-fi adventure , a rouge hero, a damsel in distress,
Aliens, the bad guy, the evil forces come to take over the world,
and........... a Legend!
Besides the costumes , the special effects, the characters (especially Chris
Tucker as Ruby Rhod)  this has it all, all you have to do is sit back and
absorb it.
The story is very thorough, there are no lose ends left dangling by the
end, but it is told in such a way as to not spoon feed you.
This has taken the top place in my book!
