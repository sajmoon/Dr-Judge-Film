This is pure scifi. Nowadays all scifi's are either &quot;soap-operas in space&quot;
(e.g. Star Trek-TNG, Andromeda, Earth Final Conflict, etc.)or &quot;horror&quot;
movies (e.g. John Carpenter's &quot;The Thing,&quot; and the &quot;Alien Bunch&quot;). This
one
(like &quot;Lost in Space&quot;) had no message the director felt needed to be
shoved
down your apparently unenlightened throat. It was a movie that entertained
from start to finish.<br /><br />Bruce is wonderful to watch even if he is only standing up against a wall
and delivering a single line: &quot;That's a negatory, I am a meat-popsicle.&quot;
(Proof: this line has been quoted to, and by, me many times.) Bruce is
great. If you are a scifi fan you should really like this one, and Bruce
makes it better than ever.<br /><br />Chris Tucker is great as &quot;Ruby Rhod.&quot; Watching his performance makes you
realize how hard he must have worked to totally dedicate himself to
playing
this totally off the wall character. Kudos to Chris for a super job
well-done. What I realized about his role was that I didn't keep thinking
&quot;When is Bruce going to show up?&quot; That's a major accomplishment since it
is
very hard to appear interesting up against a star like Bruce Willis. So
the
movie had a triple punch of great acting.<br /><br />Triple because I would be remiss if I didn't mention that &quot;Zorg&quot; was
*solidly* played by Leonard Gary Oldman. I was entranced by his stalwart
singular focus mercenary/business man/genius. Just as interesting a
character so as not to steal the show from anyone else nor make you long
for
another appearance from the others.<br /><br />This points to the great writing and directing - both allowed the
characters
to breath and develop without suffocating any other stars' roles. The
production was very cool... I'm liking this movie even more now the more I
describe it! :)<br /><br />Great scifi. Go see it.<br /><br />- Zafoid
