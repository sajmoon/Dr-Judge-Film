2002_February 20 

I first rated this movie a 6.  It's a fun science fiction film, but has a
large number of flaws.  The plot is really lame, the costume range from
magnificent to darn right awful, and I dare anyone to name any musical genre
that they didn't cram into this film (country, opera, rock, reggae, hula,
disco, everything).  There's not a lot that can be said good about this film
(except some wonderful costumes, really great sets and effects, and one of
the best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen [Milla Jovovich vs. the
aliens]).  But, you find yourself drawn to this film every time it's on (and
it's on a lot).  I've seen this film several times in the last month.  I
just had to go back and re-rate it an 8 for a level of artistry that
transcends the surface weaknesses and makes this darn fun entertainment. <br /><br />I do think this film should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for
costumes (in spite of the strappy outfit).  Instead, the award when to
Titanic, which rented all of the costumes off the rack.  Why must SF, where
nearly every costume is an original achievement, always take a back seat to
historical films that just rent the stuff already ready to
go.
