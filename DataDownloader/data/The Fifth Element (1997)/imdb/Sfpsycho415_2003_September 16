Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker star in this
action-adventure sprinkled with comedy about a futuristic New York cab
driver who is called up to save the world. Sounds stupid, i know. But
it is actually a well-made adventure with great special effects, cool
action scenes, and hilarious performances especially by Milla Jovovich
and Chris Tucker. Gary Oldman again plays a bad guy with perfection and
Tucker is hysterical but that goes without saying. Luc Besson's vision
of the future is funny and fascinating at the same time. If you're
looking to forget your troubles and have a good time, this is good
choice. 8/10
