1998_September 23 

*cough* You know... aside from a few little things which I found annoying
(the President's acing skills, the President's speech, the President in
general), I loved this movie. ... *pause* ... Then again, I don't actually
see anything past Gary Oldman when I watch it... so that might be a bit of a
cloud over my judgement. Heh heh heh...
