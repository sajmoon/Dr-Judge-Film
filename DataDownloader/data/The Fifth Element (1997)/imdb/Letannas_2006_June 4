I saw this movie so long ago. I was probably in or middle school or
something. I loved it when I saw it though, and even now it remains one
of my top choices. One of the few movies I could watch start to finish.<br /><br />It was my first encounter with the thrilling Milla Jovovich. I tell you
I think she&#39;s an amazing actress! Such range. I mean if you only know
her from The Fifth Element and Resident Evil you wouldn&#39;t think so, but
she was also in Zoolander as Katinka and in The Messenger as Joan. Sure
she doesn&#39;t really have any boobs but she&#39;s got a lot of personality,
she puts a lot of strength and vulnerability to her characters. A kick
a** female! <br /><br />That diva song is so beautiful. Touching.<br /><br />I think that this is such a cool take on the future too. The technology
is far more advanced, but the people seem real, kind of gritty. It&#39;s
like the characters are each unique. I like how you can see normal
people trying to make their living. The cops at the McDonalds, the
Chinese guy, Corban&#39;s small apartment with all the modern conveniences
and extreme lack of space hehe.<br /><br />Gosh I remember when Leeloo&#39;s fight scene was up for a nomination on
the MTV awards. I was watching. I voted for it. I forget the others.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is good. I find that in my opinion his characters are
often similar, but that is my perspective. I just think of Sin City,
Armageddon, and Unbreakable here. He&#39;s someone who gets stuff done.
Doesn&#39;t freak out. He&#39;s the guy you call when you&#39;re in trouble. Not
much for conversation, a man of few words. Calm. Hehe I liked him in
Pulp Fiction too. My favorite part is where he freaks out and starts
cursing &quot;Bedside table, next to the kangaroo. i told her specifically
not to forget my watch!&quot;<br /><br />Somebody get Chris Tucker (Blackie Chan) some more work!
