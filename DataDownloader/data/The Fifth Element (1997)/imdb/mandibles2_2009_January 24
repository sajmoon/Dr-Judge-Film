This is a movie that doesn&#39;t take itself seriously. It is more in the
adventure movie category than a Sci fi movie. It doesn&#39;t make you think
much and it is pretty much a good date movie which can appeal to a
large audience. Still the twists and turns are quite interesting enough
to make this an entertaining sci-fi adventure movie ala Star wars.<br /><br />A cab driver in the future(in the 23rd century) has the job of
protecting a woman who is the only hope against the destruction of the
earth. This woman is actually an alien from another planet. The cab
driver Korben Dallas(Bruce Willis) who is heartbroken from a previous
marriage slowly falls in love with her. The President of the world and
a priest Father cornelius are also interested in the girl in order to
save the world. There is no great twist towards the end but the many
twists and turns in the plot are quite entertaining and are not jarring
to the central plot. There is also a villain Jean Baptiste Zorg(Gary
Oldman) who wants to get the items from the girl in order to destroy
them to enable the destruction of the earth. Most of the scenes have a
sort of wry humour which is common in these types of adventure films.
The villain himself is a character with some funny lines. There are
also other characters to add more hilarity to the plot.<br /><br />The special effects are the first thing that can be noticed about this
movie. It can be seen why this movie was so expensive. The special
effects are ahead of its time and the special effects don&#39;t seem
overdone. Milla jovovich as the woman Leeloo has given an adequate
performance. Gary Oldman&#39;s performance was my favourite in this movie
as he shows no hint of the over the top performance that he did in
Leon. Here he is perfect as the villain who will do anything to create
chaos in the world. The many scenes he appears in are quite light
hearted. Even the scene towards the end with the bomb is also quite
hilarious. The only irritant in this movie is Chris tucker who has
given a really over the top performance as the anchor Ruby Rhod. At
some points, his voice is grating and his presence seems jarring. His
comic scenes with the air hostesses are not all that funny and are
quite an irritant. The role of the priest has also been done in a more
restrained funny manner. The makeup of the aliens has also been done
excellently.<br /><br />Overall you won&#39;t be disappointed as it has some good action scenes and
great special effects. And of course Milla Jovovich&#39;s costume.<br /><br />7/10
