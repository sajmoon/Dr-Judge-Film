The first time I watched this movie was on pay per view. I had no idea
what it was about, I just thought, what the hell. I had nothing better
to do. After I saw it I called my girlfriend and I couldn't stop
talking about it. Sometimes its better to watch a movie you know
nothing about because most movies just don't live up to the hype. This
movie is your basic save the world/love story. This movie has tons of
action, some comedy, and great visuals. I am a Bruce Willis fan and he
does not disappoint in this. Milla Jovovich is great in this movie. For
someone who does not have much dialog, you always feel like she is
always communicating with you. Is their a better bad guy than Gary
Oldman? Maybe Walken, but Oldman makes a case for himself in this film.
Who is Luc Besson? I never heard of him before until I watched this
movie. After this I researched him a little and found that he has many
other good films that I have checked out since. I'm not a fan of
fantasy movies, but this is more than just fantasy. A classic tale of
good versus evil. This movie is groundbreaking and is a movie you can
pop in your DVD player and watch any time. Two thumbs up, way up!
