I have tried to figure out what all the fuss is about, but I have failed
totally. 
I cannot see any merit at all in this lunacy.
Chris Tucker in particular is painful to watch. In fact, that pretty much
describes the whole film. 
Bruce Willis has been in some excellent movies, but this definitely isn't
one of them.
