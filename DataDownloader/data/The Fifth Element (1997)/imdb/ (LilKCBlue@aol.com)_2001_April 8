The first time you see this movie you might have a bit of an
&quot;okkkkaaaaayyyy&quot; feeling.<br /><br />But in repeated viewings you will be able to understand the story
better.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays Korban Dallas, a futuristic cabbie who you just love.
Milla Jovavich is the fifth element (A.K.A Leeloo), a supreme being sent to
earth to protect life.  Together, they must save the world from the evil
Zorg, played by Gary Oldman.<br /><br />Great plot, great charactors, great action=GREAT MOVIE<br /><br />See this movie if you haven't.  Milla Jovavich is beautiful, Bruce Willis
is
great, and Chris Tucker is HALARIOUS!<br /><br />I don't really know who Luc Besson is but I know that he has done a great
job with THE FIFTH ELEMENT.<br /><br />A MUST SEE FOR BRUCE WILLIS FANS OR SCI-FI ACTION FANS.
