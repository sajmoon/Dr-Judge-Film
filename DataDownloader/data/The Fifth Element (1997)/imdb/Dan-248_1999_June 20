1999_June 20 

What do you get when you combine a good script, the genius of Moebius and
the talent of Jean-Paul Gaulthier?<br /><br />A jam-packed sci-fi thriller for the new generation!<br /><br />The colors in this one are truly what make it different from  the rest.
Not
the drab greys and browns that you usually see in other sci-fi flics. The
transitions from scene to scene are also very interesting.<br /><br />This is truly a sci-fi movie for the 90's.
