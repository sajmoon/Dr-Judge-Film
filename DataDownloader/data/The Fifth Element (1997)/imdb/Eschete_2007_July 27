I think the director, Luc Besson (who is himself annoying), made one of
the most annoying films in history in &quot;The Fifth Element.&quot; The acting,
the special effects, the music, all guaranteed to set your teeth on
edge. Of course, the most annoying character is the one with the bad
orange dye job, Leeloo. Can you think of a more annoying name than
&quot;Leeloo,&quot; by the way? She speaks an annoying fake language and
generally CHEWS, MUNCHES and MAULS the scenery. Her acting had me
CRINGING. I mean BAD.<br /><br />Then there are the annoying aliens, badly made up, the annoying
villains, the annoying Chris Tucker, the annoying flying cars, and the
hair-raisingly annoying musical sequence in which a blue-skinned squid
lip-syncs to an annoying fake electronic voice.<br /><br />SO. Long story short: this film is an annoying piece. Skip it. You
really won&#39;t miss it. And, yes, Bruce Willis is annoying, too, in case
you thought I&#39;d give him a pass.<br /><br />Grade: D+.
