Every small part expertly played. Bruce Willis is always the same
character,
but, hey, so is Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, etc. Chris Tucker carries a
lot
of the comedic element, playing off Willis's straight man. Gary Oldman
plays
with the evil role as well. And the supreme being - wow - Milla Jojovich
seems to be, indeed! She does a great fight scene that I think is one of
her
better moments in the film.<br /><br />
