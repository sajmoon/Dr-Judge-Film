2007_November 1 
The first 20 minutes of this movie almost put me to sleep. I wasn&#39;t
expecting the type of caliber I seen in Leon(The Professional) though.
Overall this movie sets out to be what it&#39;s meant to be. Yet it starts
off too slow for me to rank the movie as a whole highly. Eric Serra&#39;s
soundtrack as usual is pretty well suited to the movie. I never took
this movie seriously to begin with. It&#39;s like a comedy basically. It&#39;s
pretty funny once it picks up. I feel if I&#39;m going to re-watch this
film though that... I&#39;ll have to fast forward 20 minutes in.<br /><br />If you want to see Luc Besson&#39;s best work in my opinion, I suggest you
check out the movie Leon.
