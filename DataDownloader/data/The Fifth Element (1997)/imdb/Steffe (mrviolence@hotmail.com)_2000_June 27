Well, this flick delivers what one might expect. Action, some jokes and
great special effects. As for the story, it could have been written by a ten
year old. It&acute;s never boring but on the other hand it never reaches any real
climax. By the time you have rewinded the video tape you forgotten the whole
thing. But for the two hours the film lasts, it&acute;s fun.
