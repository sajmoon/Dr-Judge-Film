1999_June 1 
Each of Luc Besson&#39;s previous two movies has been impressive, and each
has stretched his visible skills at storytelling. This third of Luc
Besson&#39;s movies is truly a French comic book broken free of its panels
-- not to be taken even remotely, momentarily seriously, it is a
wonderful mixture of a comic book&#39;s childish simplicity and a movie&#39;s
visual animation. Although quite violent, it is filled with sharp,
witty dialogue and quick characterization, with many visual jokes and
puns subtly slipped in for additional humor (the cigarette, for
example, that&#39;s 75% filter). Bruce Willis&#39;s casting as the beaten down
Corbin Dallas is obvious, but perfect. Gary Oldman deliciously
overplays the wickedly evil Zorg, Milla Jovovitch wonderfully bounces
from vulnerable to superwarrior, and the rest of the casting is equally
inspired, straight down to &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister as The President. The &quot;Mobius&quot;
inspired cityscapes and visual elements fit perfectly into the
comic-book nature of the movie.<br /><br />No question, it *does* suffer on the small screen -- try to catch it in
wide screen on a large Home Theatre system if you cannot see it at a
real theatre. This movie needs to be &quot;big&quot; to be truly appreciated.<br /><br />The world has lost its Kubrick, but it&#39;s found an obvious successor.
