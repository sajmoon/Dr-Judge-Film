1998_October 1 

I really enjoyed this movie. I know, I know, peddling cliches a little, but
at the end of the day, it was the most visually fascinating and
interestingly cast movies of all time. Now, people seem to be suggesting
that the plot was a bit confused- I seem to be missing that a little, as I
found nothing wrong with it. True, it was all a bit Saturday matinee, but it
had lots of things going ape at once, and that can't be bad, can it?
Plus, for someone like me, it was a case of 'Spot the familiar face', which
is always a bit of fun.<br /><br />In Summary:
Bravo
