Remember the days when only spotty geeks liked science fiction?  Those
days
have gone, what with the appearance of the recent sci-fi movies like
Starship Troopers, Wing Commander, and this - The Fifth
Element.<br /><br />Luc Besson's unimitable style has created one of the best sci-fi flicks to
date, with impressive visuals and excellent direction.  The special
effects
are great, and his vision of the future is cool but gaudy.<br /><br />The story is the usual run-of-the-mill world-in-danger scenario, made
better
by the humour, special fx and performances.  Bruce Willis is great in one
of
his best roles to date and Gary Oldman proves yet again that he ranks as
high as Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins as one of the best actors to come
out of the UK.<br /><br />Definitely worth 10 out of 10...
