1999_May 30 

I have read the reviews and comments but when I saw this film I was blown
away.  Luc Besson best known for his films; &quot;Le Femme Nikita&quot; and &quot;The
Professional&quot; has out done himself again.  An incredible journey from the
past to the future, excellent F/X and the direction is superb, and hats
off
to composer Eric Serra!
