5th Element is one of my favorite movies.  The costumes were great, as
are
the sets, it's funny when it needs to be, the action was fun, and all the
models playing bit parts is quite amusing.  How many other movies have an
opera performance?  Aside from snooty movies about operas.  And Milla,
*sigh* Milla is always a pleasure to watch.  i've watched it at least 6
times and will prolly watch it once a year until i die.
