'The Fifth Element' is one of a very small handful of movies that no matter
how many times I try to watch all the way through uninterrupted, I never
quite succeed. I treasure the surreal movies of Lynch, Jodorowsky and Jess
Franco, and closer to home, will watch 'Zardoz' at the drop of a hat. I can
usually handle incoherent plot-lines, over the top characters, and movies
with style over substance, but I draw the line at this self-indulgent mess.
Ever tried to read a book when drunk? That's how I feel whenever I try and
watch 'The Fifth Element'. There's something about this movie that I just
can't get into. It often seems like you're watching an unreleased sequel to
'Buckaroo Banzai'. Except without the fun and energy of that cult classic. I
really don't know what Luc Besson was trying to achieve here, but whatever
it was, unless it was to make a cinematic migraine, it didn't work. The only
thing of note about this movie is its eccentric supporting cast (Tiny Lister
as the President?!) of comedians, Brits, musicians, Luke Perry and b-grade
King, the late, great Brion James. Maybe in ten years time I'll come round
to this, but right now I'll pass. This is just plain terrible!
