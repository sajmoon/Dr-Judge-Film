This film is one of my favorites but decidedly NOT because of the
directing. Luc Besson had a story with a central theme in it (the
emotional progress of Korben Dallas, and how the fate of the world
hinges on it), but totally failed to put enough into the film to fill
that theme out. The climax of the film is greatly deflated because of
this.<br /><br />The rest of it is marvelous fun, with excellent acting from all the
major characters, uniquely entertaining side characterizations, a well
filled-out future society, and an understandable and involving
storyline. Had Mr Besson properly set up the climactic scene, it would
have been an outstanding five star winner, instead of the three and a
half star light watching that it is.
