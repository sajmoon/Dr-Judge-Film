If someone were to ask me why I love good science fiction movies, I
would use Fifth Element as a perfect example. Not only is the film
action-packed and visually imaginative, the characters are believable
and appealing, and Bruce Willis gives one of his most charismatic
performances. I have seen this film several times, and I intend to
again. Mila Jovovich proves that she&#39;s more than just a model, and Gary
Oldman, in a change-of-pace role, is both evil and funny. Chris
Tucker&#39;s Ruby Rod , though at first annoying, winds up helping Bruce
and Mila, and along the way becomes a bit of a hero himself. I do love
this movie; obviously Besson had fun with it, and so we do too. It&#39;s no
Citizen Kane, but then it doesn&#39;t pretend to be. If you haven&#39;t seen it
yet, what are you waiting for? Go enjoy it!
