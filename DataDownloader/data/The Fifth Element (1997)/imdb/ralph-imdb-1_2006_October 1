The first third of the film is good and you think it&#39;s a decent
sci-fi/action movie you&#39;ll enjoy. Then the Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker)
character is introduced and it&#39;s downhill into clich&eacute; from then on.
Such a shame as the character is completely unnecessary to the plot and
without his ever present shrill campness that only a teeny mind would
find amusing, and then surely for only 60 seconds, the film would be
much better.<br /><br />Plus points, Bruce Willis in laconic form, nice glimpses into the
future, like the Chinese Takeaway, Milla Jovovich and Ian Holm are also
well cast and add to the film.
