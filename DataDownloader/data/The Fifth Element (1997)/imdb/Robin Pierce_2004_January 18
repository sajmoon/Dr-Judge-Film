Cool enjoyable sci-fi actioner that starts off in early 20th Century Egypt
for the set up, the barrels through 300 years later for the main story.
Bruce Willis is on great form as his atypical reluctant action hero, pretty
much in the same mold as the &quot;Die Hard&quot; trilogy. The f/x are just amazing.
The New York of the future alone is worth the price of the dvd.<br /><br />The tone of the film is lighter than the advertising would leave one to
suppose - in my estimation the tone of the movie plays pretty much like a
Bond film - staggering f/x, likeable hero, awesome action sequences, some
comedy, and a lot of coolness.
