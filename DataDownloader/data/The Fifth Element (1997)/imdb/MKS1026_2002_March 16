<br /><br />A friend of mine asked me to tag along for this movie and I was pretty
tired
and had a hard time staying awake during the previews but boy did I wake!!!
and fast!<br /><br />This is fascinating movie with all this great costumes, characters, and
colors!<br /><br />At certain times it's a really funny movie, in fact I found myself laughing
throughout the whole film.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich was incredible in speaking that &quot;supreme Being&quot;
babble.<br /><br />
