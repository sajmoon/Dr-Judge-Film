It sounds to me like people either like the movie or hate the movie; no
middle of the road.  I liked it.  I know there were some unbelievable
situations but nearly every movie I see has something that wouldn't happen
in real life.  Besides the movie takes place in the future.  Who knows what
can happen.  It's just an entertaining movie with a fabulous soundtrack.
It's that simple.
