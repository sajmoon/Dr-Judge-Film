I especially liked the music, and the way it was played in conjunction
with
the script and I particularly loved Plavalaguna's singing...it was
choreographed well, and in retrospect, I can honestly say that I
thoroughly
enjoyed it when I saw it in a motel on HBO back in 1998...I enjoyed it so
much that I bought the DVD of it and watch this continuously much to my
boyfriends concern. Since I have to put ten lines of comment on this, I
would also like to say that I particularly enjoyed the non-gender
portrayal
of Chris Tucker as Rodd...he was a scream...I am watching it now on TBS
with
all the commercials and I noticed that they didn't put in the moaning of
the
princess when Ruby Rodd was playing back her voice on his microphone.  I
also didn't know that Luc Besson married Milla Jovovich in December of
1997...is that a coincidence or not? I must repeat how much I enjoyed this
flight into fantasy...and Bruce Willis looked like a stud muffin
too...
