&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is sure to be remembered as a science fiction
movie. However, it is no more science fiction than Monty Python&#39;s &quot;The
Holy Grail.&quot; It is, at its heart, a comedy -- and a very good one.<br /><br />There are many key elements to a good comedy, but timing is the most
important factor. Luc Besson proved himself a master of comedy timing.
Not only does he have the actors (and props) cued to perfection, his
film editing is done is a style later to become highly popular on the
television comedies &quot;Coupling&quot; and &quot;How I Met Your Mother.&quot; As one
group of characters ends a scene, a quick cut to different characters
continues the conversation with comedic effect. The real result is a
non-stop volley of jokes, sight gags, and quick-cut timing that gives
the viewer more of an experience than just a long wait for the big
finish.<br /><br />It should be noted that Luc made a risky choice of employing very few
comedic actors in his movie. Bruce Willis was known for comedy long
before he became an action star. However, Gary Oldman was more popular
for dark brooding characters and Milla Jovovich was mainly known for
being cute in skimpy clothing. As for Chris Tucker, this was his
breakout role that cemented his character as &quot;the mouth&quot; - which he has
continued alongside Jackie Chan.
