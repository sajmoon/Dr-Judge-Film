This is one of the best sci-fi action movies in the last 20 years. It
This was one of Bruce Willis best action roles since Die Hard. Gary
Oldman is a brilliant actor and truly excelled at being a bad guy. This
was also the beginning of Milla Jovovich&#x27;s action movie career. Even
the supporting cast was fantastic even the over the top Criss Tucker.
Movie watches like a comic book on screen, it was written by Luc Besson
which is the same guy who wrote Femme Nikita and Point of no Return.<br /><br />This movie is so good that you can watch it over and over again. The
story is solid and moves at a good pace. The special effects are well
done without being too over the top. And even though this DVD was made
in 1998 sound brilliant. There is plenty of gun fighting and
explosions...and as a added bonus Leeloo has some impressive fighting
scenes.<br /><br />Willis plays Korbin Dallas who is a Taxi driver in the future who
happens to be some retired special forces guy. He ends up giving a ride
to Leeloo and saving her from people who do not understand who she is.
She is there to save the world.
