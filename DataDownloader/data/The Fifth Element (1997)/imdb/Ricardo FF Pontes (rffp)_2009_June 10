I remember before I went to see this movie that there was a critic that
compared it to Star Wars, and two friends saw it, one liked it and the
other said it was a bad movie. Actually the latter was wrong, it is not
a bad movie, it is a horrendous awful movie. And how can this be
compared to Star Wars? Even The Phantom Menace has more plot and
credibility than this.<br /><br />Europeans like to criticize Americans movies, but when a French
director comes up with his version of a Hollywood sci-fi movie, it
accomplishes absolutely nothing.<br /><br />It can&#x27;t be categorized as sci-fi, since the science is as good as a
Duck Dodger cartoon, and there lies another problem, since The Fifth
Element tries to be funny like the cartoon, but it is not even remotely
that. It is not romantic, because Jovovich and Willis involvement is as
shallow as it can be.<br /><br />Bruce Willis&#x27; character does not have a fraction of the charisma and
wit that Han Solo had. Chris Tucker is supposed to be the comic relief
but I was hoping for one of the aliens to shoot him up so the torture
would end. The Divine Creature was actually a bit funny for being so
badly written and an emotionally retarded character. It is a pity to
see Gary Oldman being wasted in this movie.<br /><br />At halfway point, I was only hoping for the end, but unfortunately Luc
Besson will never reimburse my money and I forever lost the time I
wasted at the movie theater.
