1998_October 20 

Alas, I have searched far and wide among 'the knowing' aka critics to find
supporters of this film....was I wrong to immediately purchase the video
after only one viewing?...was my favourite, STAR WARS trilogy, to fall under
the stones of the four elements with no-one to support me?...are the nuances
of this movie as amazing as I see them (or was it that very special dry
white wine?)....NOW I KNOW....I have found the chosen at this site, those
with vision, childhood glee, and a true recognition that this is just the
most amazing, well-dialogued, beautifully crafted and fun.....FUN...movie in
a very long time.
I recommend The Fifth Element to all of my friends as a test...if they like
it, on any level, they remain friends....if not.....I am very
disappointed..........
