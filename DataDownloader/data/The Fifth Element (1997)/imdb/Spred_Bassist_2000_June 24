The Fifth Element is a great movie with intense sci-fi action and lots of
laughs. Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are excellent in their roles, and
Chris Tucker is hilarious as Ruby, though his character may have been
overplayed a bit. The best scenes are the flying car chase, and the gun
fights inside the hotel. The plot isn't the best, but thats ok because
this
movie keeps me entertained from beginning to end every time i watch it. I
give this movie a well deserved 9/10.
