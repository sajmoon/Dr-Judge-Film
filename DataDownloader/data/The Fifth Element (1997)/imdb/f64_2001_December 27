So what's your problem?<br /><br />If you are a futurist/sci-fi/spiritualist fan then this film is a must see. 
If you are a Bruce Willis fan then this film is a must see.  I think this is
the best of those genres.<br /><br />Taking place two hundred years in the future (well, mostly) this film is a
classic battle between good and evil with all levels of good and evil from
supreme beings(generally non-human) to supreme idiots(generally, though not
always, human) as the Bruce Willis character reluctantly joins a hapless
band of intra-galactic do-gooders to save the universe from supreme evil. 
This is one instance in which getting the girl has life or death
implications.  Unlike Blade Runner, for instance, this story is well
assembled and unlike Star Wars, for instance, doesn't rely on computer
effects.  I thought the international flavor of the casting lent an
additional character to the script.<br /><br />My only problem with the film is that it is reported that Eric Serra, who
scored and performed the film's music, hates doing this kind of work.  I
don't know why because his sound track CD is certainly worth owning too.<br /><br />Aziz, more light.
