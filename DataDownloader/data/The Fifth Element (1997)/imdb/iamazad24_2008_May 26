I like Bruce Willis. I saw the Sin City, Tears of the Sun all the Die
hard and many more. I recently watched Armageddon, a great movie and I
loved it. I liked Ben Affleck while he was running with his shorts,
real funny. After that I started watching this movie and initially it
looked great. But some time later,oh man, accept Bruce Willis,
everything sucked. Stupid costume, stupid vehicle even the headsets
used by the 300 years later communication system looked worse then the
present cheap headsets. There was the retard President, idiotic
costumes of the Flight attendants and MY GOD, Criss Tucker acted like a
Born Sucker and who the hell was that opera singer. I could have
destroyed my laptop display. I watched at IMDb and found it got the
nomination for Oscar. AMAZED/// It should have got 1st prize in Reggie
award.<br /><br />Sorry to hurt anyones feelings. But this is how I felt when I saw this
after Armageddon.
