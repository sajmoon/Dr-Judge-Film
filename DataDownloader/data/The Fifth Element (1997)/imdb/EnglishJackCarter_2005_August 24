.....to begin with, as usual, then like two of his other best known
movies, L&eacute;on (AKA The Professional) and Nikita (AKA La Femme Nikita) -
The Fifth Element fizzles out towards the end with astonishing
predictability. It seems he got bored around the same point while
working on these three movies and handed the reins to somebody else.
Putting Chris Tucker's character in the movie is like having the
ring-tone The Annoying Thing (AKA Crazy Frog) play on the soundtrack of
Schindler's List or Titanic when the ship ...<br /><br />Anyway, Luc Besson has improved his directorial skills markedly, The
Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc was amazing - and it's the one film
which show's Milla Jovovich can really act when she wants to. In Fifth
Element she does what the role demands of her, but when you see the
exact character reprised in two seriously inferior movies (The Resident
Evil ones) then it demeans her performance in this movie. Especially
if, like me, you see those movies before this one.<br /><br />I gave the movie a 7/10 which is high, and had it not introduced the
very, very, very annoying Chris Tucker character, it would certainly
have been on my Top 10 list of Si-Fi movies ... but unfortunately it
did, and it will continue to do so every time I watch the movie - so
I'll never watch it again. For comparison, think of the screechy
character which spoilt the later additions of the Police Academy series
of movies.
