1998_October 16 

What ? All the old comments on this movie were bad AND very brief. Can't you
be a little more precise ? What do you mind ? That the idea was born when
Luc was 16 or that the plot is stupid. It bet it's simply the former which is
not a reason but a prejudice ! The idea behind it is to reduce the oldest of
all story ideas to its simple pattern, its elements: Good versa evil. Or
better: THE good versa THE evil. And you shouldn't take plots that run like
this so seriously ! Besides, it was not only very fantasyful but also funny
! (When Oldman leaves the dream boat, opens the box ... &quot;It's empty !&quot;) I
can not understand how you can not like this movie. The first diversive plot
in years and you complain about it ! I mean, the soundtrack, the effects,
the ideas in it, Moebius himself designed the city, Jean-Paul Gaultier
designed the costumes ... I simply fail to understand you
!
And the movie's depth of detail. The guy that tries to rob Bruce with the
picture on his hat, so that he cannot be seen through the door spy. The
flying shushie boat. The cigarettes with more filter than tobacco. It is
simply wonderful.
