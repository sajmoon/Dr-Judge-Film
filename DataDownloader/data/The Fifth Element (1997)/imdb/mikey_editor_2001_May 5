Even the music is so unique: I recommend this for the pure visual pleasure
and another bravado performance by Bruce Willis. He truly is the Gary Cooper
of our time. His quiet exasperation and dauntless courage comes through
again. Everything, as it should, plays off the Willis character. He is so
much the everyman schmuck, but with muscles. The movie keeps you guessing,
even though the general feeling is understandably, that we will survive, how
to get there is never clear. Even the colors seem special to this movie. I
have no problem telling my friends it is worth seeing as a rental or the
occasional showings on HBO.<br /><br />
