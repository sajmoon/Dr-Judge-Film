  The first time I saw this movie I thought it was a bit too weird.  That
said, I've seen it a couple more times on HBO, and have come to like it. 
That says a lot for me, because most sci-fi's just don't seem to cut it
anymore (Pitch Black is one notable).<br /><br />  I really don't care whether this movie was written by a 16-yr-old or not. 
Someone with a good enough vision will put out good work regardless of
age.<br /><br />  Leeloo (Jovovich) comes close to stealing the show under Korben's (Willis)
feet.  Her character was completely disarming, and her incoherent babbling
actually seemed to make sense the way she said it.<br /><br />  Overall, I would give this an 8 of 10.  It is an amazing movie if you take
it as it is given.
