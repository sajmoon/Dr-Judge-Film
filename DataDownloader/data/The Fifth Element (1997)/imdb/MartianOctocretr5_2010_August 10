What are they shooting for here? Whatever it was, they missed. Fifth
Element attempts to marry sci-fi adventure with slapstick comedy, but
falls prey to a director and cast that can&#x27;t wait to show you the funny
stuff they can do.<br /><br />An everyday man type guy (Bruce Willis) is our hero, called upon to
save the Earth. It&#x27;s yet another instance where the audience gets
smothered by an avalanche of &#x22;other-movie references,&#x22; which forgets to
build its own story or identity. There is a plot, and the cast even
seem to be trying to make the most of this thing, but all this is lost
amidst the muddled confusion.<br /><br />The comedy relief guy (Chris Rock, probably wishing he had a better
agent) is intolerable, more grating than fingernails on chalkboard.
This tired clich&#xE9; stereotype swishing around is so awfully unfunny that
it must have been the inspiration for the despised Jar Jar Binks a few
years later. Mila Javovich is refreshingly better than any of her
co-stars, but the script offers insufficient development of her pivotal
character. The main bad guy seems to be trying to mix Bugs Bunny with
Hannibal Lecter; the result is as bizarre as you might expect.<br /><br />The ending is so hastily pasted together it&#x27;s embarrassing. The film
has moments but its desperate attempt to have you rolling in the aisles
will only have you rolling your eyes in dismay.
