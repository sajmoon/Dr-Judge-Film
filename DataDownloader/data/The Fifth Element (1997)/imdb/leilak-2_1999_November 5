1999_November 5 

This is a great movie. I was completely swept away. It has so much energy,
and also a great sense of humor, which makes it great for multiple views.
It
might not have such a great story, but the music, editing, costumes, colors
and action is top rate. However, your opinion of the movie may depend on
how
much you like (or dislike) Chris Tucker. I found him a bit annoying the
first time I saw the movie, but he actually gets more and more funny. It is
like one of those favorite old movies where you forget about time (and
plot)
and believe in the characters and their actions. I recently saw &quot;The Big
Sleep&quot; and experienced much of the same. The story wont stand for a closer
look, but what a movie. It's movie magic.
