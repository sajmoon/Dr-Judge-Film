Our listings magazine gave this 4 stars out of a possible 5.... way too
generous!
Maybe 2... 3 or 4 on the IMDb scale
Excellent design and costumes, good action sequences, but otherwise
poor.
Plot holes galore, and, if you are going to do Science Fiction, why not get
your 'tech-sounding' chat right??? The temperatures have already been
referred to, but there is also a mention of 'thermonuclear sensing'...
what??? at least Star Trek makes stuff sound genuinely
realistic.
I think the poor soundtrack (at least as broadcast on UK TV last night)
makes it hard to pick out much of what people say -- but then we'd be able
to spot more holes and inaccuracies all over the place.
A sloppy mishmash of 'Indiana Jones', Erich von Daniken, 'Die Hard' and
sub-Star Wars
