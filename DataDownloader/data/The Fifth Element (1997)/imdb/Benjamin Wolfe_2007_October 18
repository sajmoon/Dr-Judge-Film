This is both kind of out there for Bruce and yet...right up his alley.
Luc Besson, I remember meeting his cousin, in 2004 I think I like Luc
better, anyway this movie that from what I had received from critics
for the most part seemed as I recall hating this roundly. I can&#39;t
understand it. Willis as Corben Dallas is a solid chunk of man style
action unlikely hero who&#39;s style as one woman I know put it is &#39;Sexy&#39;.
Well for all intensive purposes, I don&#39;t judge his looks like that, but
I was far-out too into this space-case that Dallas was on. He is
surrounded by humorous aliens and humans then pursuing the drama that
he does so well. Gary Oldman is a twisted and wild criminal character,
he always does a job exceeding my expectations. As a fellow viewer
stated the score of the film went from Enigma to Vangelis and a myriad
of other types of music followed, truly wide in it&#39;s audio path. The
plot, learn not to war, a little too Alan Alda for me, I never could
take too much M*A*S*H, viewing in long shut me down. However all aside,
I thought the casting was right where it should be and with exception
of some of the aliens being a little too &#39;plastic&#39; for a feel of
reality, I find this is fun and entertaining every time I watch
it...Chris Tucker always kills me, he is one of a kind.<br /><br />For sure in the end recommended to action lovers and Willis and Tucker
types everywhere. (***)
