2000_February 18 

I didn't bother to see this film in the cinema or hire it on video, I just
didn't think it would be any good.  However when I finally watched it on
TV
I went out and bought it on DVD the next day.  The aspect I liked most was
the divine language and its delivery.  It sounded like a real language and
it sounded like the 'perfect' language.  A lot of thought clearly went in
to
this dialogue.
