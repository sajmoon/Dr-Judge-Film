indeed it was!  the movie 's plot is not the most original but some of the
dialogue was great.  chris tucker was really funny.  milla jovovich was
really awesome in this movie.  bruce willis...well he's bruce willis.
it's
got some of the classic bruce willis butt-kicking action and some of the
romance that almost always appears in his movies.  this was a good movie.
i've watched it 6 times and i still find it extremely enjoyable everytime.
the &quot;diva&quot; session was unbelievable.  the graphics and costumes were cool
too.  it's a fun movie!
