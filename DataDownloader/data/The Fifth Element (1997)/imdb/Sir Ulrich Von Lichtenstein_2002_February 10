And I have seen a lot of really bad films. This is a movie that would be
rejected from &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; as being too far below their
usual standards. There is not one redeeming quality to this gargantuan piece
of dreck. It is brainless and juvenile beyond words, and the stroy and
acting would insult the intelligence of Billy Ray Cyrus. Fine, the
production design is eye-catching, but at it's best, it's merely a rip-off
of Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. At it's worst, it looks like Bob Fosse
tried to direct a musical version of &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the
Universe&quot;. Luc Besson could not direct a five year-old to the bathroom. And
I won't even describe Chris Tucker's performance, because the memories are
just too painful. This movie is bad beyond all possible levels of badness.
Okay, maybe it's not quite that bad, but it sure isn't
good.
