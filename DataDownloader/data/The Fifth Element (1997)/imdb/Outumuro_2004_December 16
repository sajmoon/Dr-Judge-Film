There is nothing about The Fifth Element I can say, that hasn't been
said already. Other than I've saw it when it premiered in theaters, own
the DVD... and still enjoy watching with people who've never seen it
before. :) <br /><br />So! I'll mention what happened in the theater. Some friends and I went
to see it here in the Los Angeles area on a 70mm screen, and in full
surround sound. It is one of the older and larger 70mm screens... the
theater seats easily 1500 people or more.<br /><br />During Leeloo's resurrection scene, you could hear a pin drop the
audience was so quiet. Then as the resurrection was complete and you
see the unveiling as a beautiful human woman... you could hear a
collective GASP from every guy in the theater! <br /><br />Only a second later you could hear a collective thump of every woman in
the theater smacking their husbands/boyfriends/etc.!!! <br /><br />That is one of those film-going experiences that comes only once in a
very great while. :P
