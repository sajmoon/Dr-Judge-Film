I saw the Fifth Element when it was out in theatres with four other young
men, and there were mixed reactions between all of us.  Our liking for the
movie was split down the middle; 3 of us liked it and 2 of us didn't.  It's
not for everyone but still worth seeing because of Chris Tucker's comedic
performance.  The effects are really good but the film itself is a bit
childish script wise.  Still a good film.
