Let go and enjoy this thrilling ride! Beautiful protagonists, amazing
scenery, colors, action, humor, fiction, fantasy. This is Brazil meets Die
Hard. It was all I asked for a summer escape. Witty lines, smart details,
smooth plot. Unfortunately the last minutes are cheese-o-rama. It's a shame
they were so clumsy at the end. Still, a definite recommendation!
