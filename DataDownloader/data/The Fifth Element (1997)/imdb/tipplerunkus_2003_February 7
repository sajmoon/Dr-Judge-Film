&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is bad beyond all possible levels of badness. The acting
is atrocious, the writing is so inane it seems to have come from the mind of
a dim-witted nine year old, and the visuals are merely stolen from &quot;Blade
Runner&quot; and many other, better films. This would be an awful movie even
without Chris Tucker in it. Throw him into the mix, and it becomes
unwatchable.
