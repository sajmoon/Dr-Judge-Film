2008_October 30 
I watched a lot of (Besson)&#39;s movies, as a writer, director, or even
producer (sometimes all at once) and I felt how the man is trying to
take the action entertaining cinema to the next level, and how also his
sense of humor is so lost ! <br /><br />In his entire career, he couldn&#39;t pull off one masterly joke. Yes, the
action is all here and aspirant but there is that certain amount of
silliness around. (Milla Jovovich) was funny but not that funny !
(Bruce Willis) was right in between the 2 phases of the old lively
comic Willis (Moonlighting&#39;s type) and the later cold unfunny Willis
(The Whole Nine Yards)&#39;s one, or to tell you the truth, in here he
maybe passed it to the second phase already ! (Chris Tucker) is TOTALLY
UNBEARABLE to say the least, this guy really must own a secret to be in
movies till now and to have his name over Jackie Chan&#39;s name and bigger
salary also in their average franchise &quot;Ruch Hour&quot;??? (A mystery !), or
maybe he&#39;s the luckiest comedian alive (in fact the luckiest
unsuccessful comedian alive !), He lost the Razzie award for that year
because it went to the only one who can be more awful : Dennis Rodman
in (Double Team)!. Even fine actor with many faces like (Gary Oldman)
hackneyed himself to the utmost with no profit or for the sake of
making any kind of attractive marked evil character; the same case you
would find it again in (Besson)&#39;s less silly, more appeal, same stupid
(Leon) ! <br /><br />Whenever (Besson) put his touch everything becomes madcap, horrendous,
and most of all ridiculous. I liked the main idea as good plot for :
&quot;you must save the world my son&quot; + &quot;shoot&#39;em up&quot; kind of video game. As
a bonus this time (Besson) assures that : being spiritual is needed,
the woman is the basic element, and how the hero must be American to
sell your action flick internationally ! <br /><br />The whole movie was forced or graceless which exposed the story as too
empty. The dialog is extremely not droll, the characters are
stereotypes with inner-scorn !, the ironies are just tasteless, the
cartoonish atmosphere was mostly blazing but lacks wittiness and
elegance, the monster creatures weren&#39;t scary (OK, that&#39;s maybe the
point, but they weren&#39;t clever or interesting either !), the camera&#39;s
angles looked scary and loved to deform ! The performance is all bad,
it&#39;s what supposed to be learned as the complete Razzie acting, (thank
god that Ian Holm was there), it was childish and I do mean it in the
bad sense. It had been ruled by effective repugnant spirit like your
classmate who specialized in saying the most non-laughable jokes ever
and desperately continues saying them !, watch carefully just one scene
when Willis finds no escape from the reporters in every corner; it
oozes intolerability with all the meanings of the word ! This is
perfectly the kind of works that nominates for the Oscar of the best
effects, sound effects editing, and doesn&#39;t make you laugh or amuse you
fully in the same time.<br /><br />(Besson) was so determined on giving it some different style (the
operatic singing, Cheb Khaled singing in the background of the flying
car chase,..) to present the French contribution in making such
blockbusters, but all in all that was relatively influencing factor as
the silliness attacked outrageously. It&#39;s more like when you love the
colors of a drawing and hate, just hate, the drawing itself, though the
drawing, its colors, and its drawer are all one.<br /><br />In most of his movies (Besson) wanted to make the forthright American
action in the American way to compete with the real American flicks. He
succeeded in much of this mission, but big sorry, he didn&#39;t -
especially with movies like this one - surpass any of them, despite how
(The Fifth Element) was once The most expensive French movie ever made.<br /><br />Objectively : It&#39;s fair as loud brainless comic-book, with entertaining
detached sequences if only you can stand its innate silliness.
Subjectively : I was hoping for the ending since I was in the middle of
it ! But as kind of (Blade Runner)&#39;s spoof or opposite, (or what I love
to see as this) it worked for me.
