I can't really improve over the title of this review. It was disjointed, 
hyperbolic, slapstick with cartoon sound effects and yet managed
to be ridiculous, impossible to care about, and incapable of
cooperating in the willing suspension of any kind, shape, or form
of disbelief.
If you liked &quot;Hudson Hawk,&quot; you might like this too. It has a slightly
stronger odor of plot at least.
