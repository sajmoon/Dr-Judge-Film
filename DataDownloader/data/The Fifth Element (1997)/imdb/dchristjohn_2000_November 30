I saw this movie in the theater and HATED IT! I mean I couldn't STAND this
movie and had added it to my movie death list.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I was in an alternate state of mind one night when this
came on cable.... thank goodness.<br /><br />This movie is frickin HILARIOUS! I figure that I must have hated it the
first time because the TV ads described it as a Star Wars type movie.<br /><br />No chance this is a blatant comedy and Chris Tucker steals the show as Ruby
Rod. I must have about 20 Ruby Rod waves on my PC right
now.<br /><br />Check it out and be ready to laugh.
