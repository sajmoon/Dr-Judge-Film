I really believe that they billed this movie wrong.  Many folks came in
expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least.  It's
not like Star Wars.  It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually
stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop
action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek.
Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who
ever said comic books had to have strong plots?
Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the
casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica,
intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time.
So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great
stuff!
