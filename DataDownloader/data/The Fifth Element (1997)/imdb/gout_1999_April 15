1999_April 15 

like blade runner, *the fifth element* will be regarded more kindly in
retrospect.<br /><br />of course some of it was difficult to swallow; of course some of it was
derivative of other sci-fi / fantasy classics.<br /><br />but this film failed to *follow the leader* of sci-fi future flicks - the
precedent established by classics *blade runner* &amp; *the road warrior* of the
future as a bleak dark coloured netherworld.<br /><br />overpopulation? sure! pollution and destruction of basic natural resources?
of course! but why do it all in black - what's the matter with a few
brightly coloured gaultier fashions and *beautiful people* waiting on you at
airports &amp; fast-food restaurants?! ;)<br /><br />the splashy, unique visuals &amp; luc besson's imagery counteract any so-called
*weak points* of the overly familiar plot and storyline - *star wars* was
once chided for the same premise &amp; plot reasons too, you know . . .
