I wrote this review many times and none of them seem right so I'll keep
it simple.<br /><br />When a raze of aliens throw a meteorite to destroy the earth, the only
hope is to find the fifth element. Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a
retired policeman or soldier or something like that, that drives taxis
for a living, and one day a girl, Leloo (Milla Jovovich), fall in the
taxi making a hole the roof. Soon he discovers that she's not a normal
woman an he take her to Vito Cornelious (Ian Holm), long story short,
Korben ends up with her in a cruiser to find the rocks that leads to
the fifth element, but they aren't the only ones looking, Zorg (Gary
Oldman) are willing to do anything to get it.<br /><br />This flick is in my top ten greatest movies I've seen, Bruce Willis is
the same as all his movies, Gary Oldman is superb as always as MIlla
Jovovich and Ian Holm, Chris Tucker is hilarious and his character is
great.<br /><br />An awesome flick for every taste.
