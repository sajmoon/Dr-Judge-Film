I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />No, it doesn&acute;t help You in any questions concerning how to run Your life,
You can&acute;t draw any real sense off it and of cause You must not see this
movie.<br /><br />But if You leave all that behind and want a real entertaining space opera,
give it a try.<br /><br />I was sceptical at first...
... but it blew my mind. 5th element handles it&acute;s story easy
as
You slice cheese - it&acute;s simply run through it.<br /><br />It&acute;s joyful, cheerish, ironically, entertaining. But also a
bit
romantic, uneven, playful futuristic and emotional.<br /><br />In the end You have to decide  for yourself: if You don&acute;t expect a
meaningful and serious movie but a cool kabuki of a hell of a story and
scenes You must see it.
