The trailers for this film made it look like the next Die Hard, which
it&#39;s not. But not get the wrong idea, this movie a lot of fun and there
is definitely some great action. The story focuses on Korben Dallas
(Willis), who is an ex-army man who now drives cabs for a living. He
stumbles upon Leeloo (Jovovich), who is needed to save the world from
Mr. Skull. It&#39;s Dallas&#39; job to protect her. It might sound corny, but
it&#39;s not. This film absolutely works, with great characters, great
dialog, a great story, and great action when needed. I think it&#39;s a
real shame that this movie wasn&#39;t a hit, cause there are definitely
movies out there that are way worse that have done way better. I give
this movie a solid 8/10, probably in my top 50 favorite movies.
