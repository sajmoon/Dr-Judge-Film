1998_October 11 

Well I have seen this movie 5 times now and each time I see it the more I
like it.  It seems it takes a while for a good Sci Fi flick to come around,
and I honestly believe that the 5th Element was a great one.  I would rank
it easily in my top 5.  I thought the story line was good and the special
effects Great.  The characters were pretty well developed and the cast was
perfect.  Really no complaints from me on this movie.  I also think that
Eric Serra did a great job on the Soundtrack to the movie.  I think that is
what helped make this movis so good in my opinion.  I gave this a movie a
10!<br /><br />Jason
