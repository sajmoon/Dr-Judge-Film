1998_November 20 

Everyone who comments favorably on this film seems to be of the school that
says SFX + color + action + weird, offbeat ideas + supercool protagonist +
sexy love interest = great movie.  Sorry, it just doesn't work that way, not
even in this post-Tarantino era.  A great movie is always more than the sum
of its parts.  This one, despite getting an &quot;A&quot; for effort, just doesn't
make the cut.  The direction is too frenetic and frantic. The director
seemed afraid to take his time and establish a rhythm.  The result is a
jumble of images that do little more than jangle the nerves.
The one exception was the counterpoint of the fight vs. the singing diva
sequence. (Borrowed, of course, from The Godfather and countless other
movies).  And just who was behind that incredible voice?  Why have we not
heard more of her?
