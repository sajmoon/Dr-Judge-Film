Yep, there have been a few movies that haven't been totally good as they
could have been, and Gary Oldman is a actor who can literally SAVE a film
from being very rubbish. Gary has the best role in this movie, you don't
even need to question that. Another thing that certainely helps to bring the
film it to average standards is the use of wonderful special affects.<br /><br />Luc Besson is billiant, he made a perfect movie when he directored Leon
(sometimes credited as The Professional. It makes you wonder why he just
couldn't really do the same with this one.
Gary Oldman makes this film, like I said. He let's him show-off his skills,
exspecially his wide range of varied accents he do.
This is watchable, fun in places too......
