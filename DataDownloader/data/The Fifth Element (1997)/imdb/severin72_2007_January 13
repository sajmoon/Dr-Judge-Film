If nothing else, Luc Besson&#39;s big budget sci-fi bomb manages to look
like no other film. The Frenchman succeeds in bringing a very European
look in to a major Hollywood movie (visually, the film most resembles a
certain breed of European comic book) and for that alone deserves
considerable credit. The effects, production and costume design all
have been thought through with considerable care and make a coherent
and compelling world even if, individually, they don&#39;t always work. The
story, concerning the embodiment of love being required to save the
universe, is deeply silly, aiming for profundity and missing by a fair
margin but that&#39;s beside the point. The ride is entertaining and it&#39;s
worth arguing that no female actor has ever done better as an action
hero than Mila Jovovich. Kathleen Turner bombed in V.I. Warshawski
(such a comprehensive disaster that, to be fair, that she never stood a
chance) and the much more physically appropriate Geena Davis failed
repeatedly with scripts of varying quality. The multilingual and
seriously smart Jovovich has proved to have a startling range. She can
do a complex historical character in &quot;The Messenger&quot;, a comic villain
in &quot;Zoolander&quot; and then beat the bejeezus out of all-comers in
something like this. Leeloo is the only role in the film that asks much
of any of the actors (Gary Oldman, as usual, gives enormously more than
he is asked) and Jovovich really responds pulling off some very
difficult scenes. Accepted on its own terms and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is
a unique experience.
