Last night I watched &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997) written /directed by
Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a
huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never -
the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take
itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect
mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the
comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg
might have used some ideas of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; in his great
&quot;Minority Report&quot;. The story&#39;s five elements, four stones that
represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a
girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as
ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens
and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and
saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but
the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story
and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I
think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there
is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in
one&#39;s childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are
terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, &quot;enfant terrible&quot;
of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and
attention - so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the
garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example. Who would
think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when
wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis&#39;s orange top that matches
Milla&#39;s blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod
(Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think
of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the
eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect
choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind&#39;s only hope for survival in
the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and
Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred.
