Okay, okay..some parts are really hokey--esp. Gary Oldman, but I like the
freshness of this movie. It's kind of done tongue in cheek. I mean
EVERYONE
is trying to save the world. What is interesting is that it's not the
TOUGHNESS of Bruce or any character that saves the world. I really like
the
Diva and her singing as well and the some of the ideas of earth in the
future.
