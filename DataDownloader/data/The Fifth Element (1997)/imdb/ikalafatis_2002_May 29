The Fifth Element is a parody of a sci-fi movie, and as such it should be
judged.<br /><br />It is not a serious sci-fi movie, as saving the world is not supposed (to
all unlucky souls that watched either of &quot;Independence day&quot; or
&quot;Armageddon&quot;)
to be fun at all. This movie is an action flick, set in the future. Sort of
like &quot;Die hard 2020&quot;.<br /><br />The storyline is interesting albeit a bit too loosely flushed out. We don't
learn much about the priestly order of the protectors, or for that matter
what this &quot;pure evil&quot; is all about and why it wants to destroy life (and
then what?). Nevertheless, the plot is clear: Good against good-ole Evil,
with a pinch of romance and a hefty dose of explosions. Don't expect too
many twists either.<br /><br />Besson directs with professionalism, but without passion. Cinematography
does not deserve any special mentioning too. Costumes, props and special
effects are top-notch though and contribute greatly to the
entertainment.<br /><br />Bruce Willis wonders in macho-funny land. His punch lines alternating with
his punches. Milla Jovovich is physically exquisite and does a reasonably
good job acting too. Holm and Oldman are solid, if restricted in their
outfits. The various cameos (with the exception of Luke (look at my hair)
Perry are well-put.<br /><br />Don't buy it, don't rent it even. Piggyback on somebody's passion for Bruce
or Milla as appropriate and see it. Then go watch Bladerunner and
compare.<br /><br />
