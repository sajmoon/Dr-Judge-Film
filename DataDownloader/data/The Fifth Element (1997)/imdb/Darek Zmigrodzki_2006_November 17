Not the greatest movie by ordinary standards, but one of my all-time
favorites. Very unique, very quirky, and just all over the map. It&#39;s a
totally-fantastic story set in a very crazy (and very unrealistic)
future, and though is not a totally serious movie, does have some
serious elements in the plot. A great story with a deep, thoughtful
plot, the movie tells a greater story of love conquering evil. But it&#39;s
not a serious movie by any means. There is lots of action, lots of
comedy, and a surprising amount of unique art and music for a sci-fi
action movie. The cinematography and music was beautiful at times, and
other times just silly or even painfully-bad, but it all went very well
with the overall theme of the movie. Very entertaining, for anyone,
even if you&#39;re not into sci-fi or action movies. I definitely recommend
seeing this one, it&#39;s a very unique movie to say the least.
