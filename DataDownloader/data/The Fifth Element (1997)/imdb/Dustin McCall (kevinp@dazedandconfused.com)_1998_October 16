1998_October 16 

This is the best movie I have ever seen. It's a pleasure for the eyes with
all the dazzling effects. Milla Jovovich is absolutely incredible. Bruce
Willis is still the man of action and Chris Tucker is exceptionally funny.
Luc Besson has really out-done himself on this one. I recommend that
everyone see this movie.
