1998_November 8 

Excellent costuming. Visual effects are spectacular with a
cast
of characters that develop quickly and lead you through a non-stop tour of
Luc Besson's vision of the future. Eric Serra's music score is powerful and
dynamic which accentuates and reinforces the movie's overall look and feel.
Great role for Milla Jovovich who takes on the cartoon character of LeeLoo
and brings it to life.
The diva/fight scene is a cinema event that is second to none. It alone is
worth the price of admission.
