A fantastic, mad sci-fi black comedy set in the future, loads of big names
like Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker, Brion James, ect.
Loads of wicked costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Tons of SFX, none stop
action, apart from the opera bit which was also brilliant! Overall a
really
good little story considering 'Luc Besson' thought of it while at school.<br /><br />Look out for Chris Tucker as 'Ruby Rhod' he's wild...<br /><br />
