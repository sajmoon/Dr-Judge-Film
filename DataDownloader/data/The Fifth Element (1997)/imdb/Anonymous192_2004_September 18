I saw the film and I found it wonderful, both story, and acting,
especially Milla Jovovich'. Milla's acting was excellent, successfully
incorporating the tough heroine with the sensitive femme creating the
perfect blend. I thought her acting competence so explicit, evidenced,
for example, with her usage of the fictional language so fluid as if it
were real and one of which she was a native speaker: that cannot be
easy! However, Milla's performance was not the only one demonstrating
competence and brilliance: all of the actors were excellent and
credible! Aside from the, at times, excessive violence, I encountered
the film essentially delightful, including among other aspects the
creative and unique futuristic imaginations of which the film was
well-endowed. Kudos to all: a must see!
