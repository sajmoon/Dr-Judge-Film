In the beginning scene, where the one alien is hit by the Professor's
assistant still being into the secret room, the wall is starting to
move and closes before the alien is able to escape. - It's hand is left
between the two halves of the wall.<br /><br />When Korben, Leeloo and Cornelius &amp; David return to this room in the
end of the film to put the stones at their places - where has the alien
gone to? As it is big and mostly made of metal, there should at least
be some parts left, shouldn't they?<br /><br />By the way: Those Alien just look CUTE! :))
