This movie is one of our all time favorites, watched again and again.  The
cinematography and production design is stunning, and its production date,
before the current fad of CG, lends it an air of credibility in the
creature
effects department.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this yet, shut off your PC and go rent it now.
