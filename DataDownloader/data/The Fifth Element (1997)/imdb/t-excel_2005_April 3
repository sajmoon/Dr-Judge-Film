this movie is one of the great ones. Easy to watch, but still with a
big story behind it. lots of humor, actions, different species. and one
of the funniest things i've seen, &quot;the Chinese fly by restaurant guy in
his old flying boat&quot;. Chris Tucker with his freaky voice, the heavenly
Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman plays &quot;Zorg&quot; great and Bruce Willis...what
can i say about him...i'm a big fan ! The movie is far from perfection,
that's why i gave it one point deduction. but like i said &quot;it's went
straight into my personal top 5.<br /><br />My Final Conclusion: nothing more to say, just go and watch it, and
hopefully you'll become just a big a fan as me.
