This is one of those movies that creeps up on you the more you see
it.
The first viewing we concentrated on the action, but second and third time
left us listening to the dialog more and more.  Bruce Willis is at one of
his best roles with Gary Oldman as a great co-star.  Milla Jovovich is
riveting as an &quot;Alien?&quot;.  A sleeper movie that did not get enough profs
when
it came out.  The DVD version is great, widescreen picture quality is
excellent and the 5.1 Dolby Digital is very well done.  I wonder if a DTS
version would be a little more open with the effects sounds.  Watch it on
the big screen with the lights out ... great.
