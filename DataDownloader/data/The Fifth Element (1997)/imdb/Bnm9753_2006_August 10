i like this film a lot as the characters are original, they draw you
into the film straight away and the characters and special effects keep
you hooked right to the end. I have see many sci-fi films but this film
packs the biggest punch in my opinion this is better than alien films
by far. Gary oldman is brilliant as the classic villain zorg and Bruce
Willis also put in a remarkable performance as the military hardman but
milla jovovich steals the show as the kick ass superhuman. I strongly
recommend this film even if you don&#39;t like sci-fi as unique films like
this are extremely hard to come by. I liked this film as the characters
made me laugh and there is no film that i know of that matches the
fifth element for suspense,action or breathtaking special effects
