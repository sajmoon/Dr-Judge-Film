Luc Besson wrote this as a teenager, it shows.  Cameron did the same with
the Abyss, Landis with American Werewolf in London.  The films all present
naive concepts more in tune with style and flash rather than deeper
substance.  My only real thought with The Fifth Element is: how many times
did Besson watch Heavy Metal before making this?  So much material is
obviously inspired from it that I just started rolling my eyes.  By the end,
everything has abandoned the sci-fi genre and gone into the fantasyland that
George Lucas reigns over as king...I am, of course, sarcastic in saying
that.<br /><br />Truth to be told, neither Willis nor Jovovich are noteworthy in this film. 
Holm is wasted on a cracked-out priest that made me remember the glory days
of Ash the android.  Oldman is an oddball this time, unlike his serious role
in The Professional (Leon) and Chris Tucker is on the spot as the warp speed
DJ.  Sometimes I was wondering when Denis Leary was going to come along and
give the coup de-grace to the whole project with more lightning fast
banter.<br /><br />Thankfully, Besson has Thierry Arbogast's help in creating some of the most
diabolical visuals this side of Blade Runner.  Most of the CGI is too
obvious and the makeup effects are terrible, not to mention the sound, but
when looked upon as parody, this is a new Spaceballs.  You decide if that's
good or bad.<br /><br />Overall, Star Wars meets Transformers meets North by Northwest meets
Hard-Boiled.  You decide if it's good or not, I think it needed some
enlightening ahead of time.  2.5 out of 5 stars.
