When this movie was promoted, it was said to be the next star wars.
This being one of the most ridiculous claims a film maker has ever made
which will stick in my mind for the rest of my life.<br /><br />As an action movie, this is actually a damn good movie. But in terms of
storyline, plot, cast, creativity and more, it&#x27;s a hilarious
disappointment. Tiny Zeus Lister as president was one of the worst
casting decisions ever made. Every time you see him with his crooked
goofy eye you can&#x27;t help but chuckle.<br /><br />Then of course the character that is more or less the writer&#x27;s &#x22;christ&#x22;
character of a virgin birth, is also a virgin and about 20 years
younger than our hero, of course develops feelings for him and by the
end of the movie, the could be romance is a reality.<br /><br />This is just a VERY stupid movie by a VERY overrated Euro trash film
maker. For the last 25 years these guys have pitched ideas to American
studios and it must be something about their accents winning these
robot driven executives over because they make an awful lot of crap
that any semi intelligent person would read and think &#x22;you wanna do
what??&#x22;. Only someone completely void of artistic sense would green
light such disaster.
