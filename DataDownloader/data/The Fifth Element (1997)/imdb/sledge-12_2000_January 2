2000_January 2 

This film must be considered a landmark film in the same vein as Star Wars
and other true space operas. My immediate impression of Fifth Element was
&quot;Cool! Somebody else remembers 'Heavy Metal'&quot;.  Luc Besson deserves much
more credit for this film than he has received. Hopefully, Luc's film
represents a flowering of the science fiction space opera. A wonderful
companion film to Fifth Element would be a big screen treatment of
'Stranger
in a Strange Land' - directed, of course, by Luc Besson himself. Wonderful,
visionary film to say the least!
