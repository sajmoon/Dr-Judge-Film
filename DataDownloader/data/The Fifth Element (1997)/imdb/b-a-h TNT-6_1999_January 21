1999_January 21 
Call me stupid, but I can't really get into a movie like this one. It's
so predictable, fake, ridiculous that I struggle to believe someone
actually liked it.<br /><br />Of course, the fifth element is (guess what!!!) love, the star has a
really sad past, the enemies (some really bad and dumb aliens) wanna
destroy the world, etc. People get murdered everywhere during the
so-called &quot;fights&quot; (of course, the &quot;star&quot; character could shot 20 of
them without even being hit, and that says it all about how this movie
cares about characters' role), but nobody cares as, the movie implies,
they &quot;are not important&quot;.<br /><br />Wow, that's love, sure.<br /><br />Protect the innocent before killing the guilty. That would mean
something about what love really is.<br /><br />BTW, the final scene is even more pathetic than the rest of the movie.<br /><br />2/10
