Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod character is just way too amazing. I've seen this
one over and over again. All the performances are very fine. Mila makes a
pretty good 5th element and she really manages to pull out a funny
character
(Multi Pass!). The Diva Plavalaguna scene (the opera) is a great musical
accomplishment. It has all the needed to make a comedy/action and more.
Perfect!
