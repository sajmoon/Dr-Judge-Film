Polarization.  That's what this movie does.  People either hate it or
love it.  Personally, I love it!  It has exactly what I look for in a film:
Action, Comedy, Romance, Suspense and FX.  In fact, it's the reason I bought
my DVD player!
Sure, the plot had some holes.  I don't know of any movie that doesn't.
But if you create a movie that is visually stunning, witty, and can keep you
on the edge of your seat for 2 hours, then plot holes seem to
disappear.
I was particularly impressed with the costumes.  Very futuristic, and
appropriate considering the overall look of the film.  The music is
top-notch.  If you haven't purchased the sound-track, please do.  It's a
great combination of orchestration, techno-style rock, urban, and
classical.
Most everyone I know who has seen the movie loves it.  There are always
exceptions, but overall, you do not have to be a sci-fi fanatic to
appreciate The Fifth Element.
