Every 5,000 years, a giant Evil globe threatens to destroy all that is
Good. This may not be as dire as it sounds, because we&#x27;re still here;
apparently, Earth is the front line of defense in the War, and does a
good job protecting the Universe. Essential in winning the time cyclic
battle is &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; which appears in the form of supreme punk
Milla Jovovich (as Leeloo). She is introduced in orange hair, white
panties and a wide bandage. Wearing it well, Ms. Jovovich falls into
the cab driven by bleached-blond Bruce Willis (as Korben Dallas). As
the plot dissipates, humor takes over this extravagant work by Luc
Besson. Whatever was intended, the visuals overpower everything except
Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker, who look like they know eye candy when
they see it.<br /><br />***** The Fifth Element (5/7/97) Luc Besson ~ Bruce Willis, Milla
