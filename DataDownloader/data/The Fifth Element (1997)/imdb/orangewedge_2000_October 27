OK, for starters I never used to think that Bruce Willis was that good an
actor, possibly because i loathe action films(big explosions, car chase,
indestructable humans etc.). But this film changed my option on Willis. It
made me think that behind the muscular fisique and the receding hairline
(sorry Bruce but it's true), that there was a good actor in him. This
movie
made me believe that, and his ability was revealed again in &quot;The 6th
Sense&quot;.
Well done Willis.
For me this movie shows a future that come very well be possible, much
like
the of Ridley Scott in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, such as the cigarettes with huge
filters, the sky-scraper McDonald's and a new religion.
Gary Oldman seemed at home in his usually bad guy role, Milla Jokovich
seemed, pardon the pun, perfect for Leelu and Willis was spot on as an
ex-army boy as Kroben Dallas.
All in all, well done Besson, you have created yet another masterpiece to
go
with &quot;LEON&quot; and &quot;La femme Nikita&quot;. But one question, what was that
transparent plastic thing on Gary Oldman's head?
