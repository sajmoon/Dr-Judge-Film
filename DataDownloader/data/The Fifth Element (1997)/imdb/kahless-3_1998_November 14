1998_November 14 

I think the film was more than perfect. One of the top actors that has
created his own manner in the film sector was involved with fascinating
Milla Jovovich.....
Of course I'm talking about our fabulous Bruce...<br /><br />Gary Oldman was also performing quite good with his usual evil guy
role.
Film, actors (Never forget Chris Tucker), scenario...
everything was superb.They made a film watchable for at least 3 times for
normal spectators.
