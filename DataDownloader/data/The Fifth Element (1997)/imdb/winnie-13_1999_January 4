1999_January 4 

I couldn't get into this film at first.  It was a little hard to decipher.
Until good old faithful Bruce came into the picture.  Now, I have always
liked Brucie but I have never found him attractive...until now.  Damn, he
looked fine in this film.  Compact, hard and he smiled!.....quite a few
times.  To top it off he was more human than he has ever been.  Except
perhaps for The Colour of Night.  I plan to see this film again.  And again.
The combination of Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman with the new Bruce as seen
through my eyes is just superb.
A masterpiece!
