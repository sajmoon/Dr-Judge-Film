1999_February 26 

I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, the story's lousy, Gary
Oldman feels wasted, the freeze frame at the end is totally laughable... And
on the other, Luc Besson truly demonstrates his talent as a filmmaker with
the wonderful use of his camera and most of all his editing, Bruce Willis
oozes charm, Milla's great, it's fun, cool music and costumes and overall a
genuine feeling of invention. 4/10
