I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
Yes, it ripped off some elements of Star Wars, but this French take on
Sci-Fi was quite refreshing. Elements of Stargate: yeah if anything with a
desert in it does. See Dune and The Mummy and Lawrence of Arabia and claim
the same.
When most American Sci-Fi looks like the bastard son of Gene Roddenberry,
this was different.
Liked the sound track.
Bruce took a chance, at least, and not his worst role (See Hudson Hawk if
you don't believe me).
It had action, humor, romance, what the hell else do you
want?
And Chris Tucker was outrageous!
SEE Bilbo Baggins in his earlier work!
