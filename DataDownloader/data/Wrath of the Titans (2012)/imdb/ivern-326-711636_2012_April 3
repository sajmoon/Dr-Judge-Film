Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to the 2010 movie Clash of the Titans.
I personally enjoyed Clash of the Titans. I thought it was a fun movie
to watch. I saw it with my friend, and we both found it enjoyable. But
the sequel, Wrath of the Titans, is definitely an improvement over it&#x27;s
predecessor.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans starts off a few years after Clash of the Titans.
Perseus has decided to live like a normal human, and he&#x27;s got himself a
son. But when he finds out that Zeus, his father, and all the other
gods are becoming mortal and weak because the humans have lost their
faith in them, he literally goes to hell to put things back into place.<br /><br />Just like the previous film, the story is crap and just an excuse to
have some epic battles shoved in. The battles were cool, the characters
were likable and the special effects were brilliant.<br /><br />Now one of the coolest things about Wrath of the Titans is the 3D, and
how it&#x27;s handled. Things pop out at you, you go through tight corners
while you feel like you&#x27;re really there. There&#x27;s one shot were I
literally jumped because something just literally came out of the
screen.<br /><br />Overall, Wrath of the Titans is a good movie to watch, and it&#x27;s
entertaining to watch in 3D.
