At the Theater - &#x22;Wrath of The Titans&#x27; - Every lame idea that didn&#x27;t
make it into 2010&#x27;s &#x22;Clash of The Titans&#x22; was apparently spliced
hastily together in this poorly conceived, annoyingly bombastic mess of
a follow up. I didn&#x27;t care for &#x22;Clash&#x22; much at all, but anyone who
tells you that &#x22;Wrath&#x22; is an improvement is smoking some serious dust.
I have it in a three way tie with 2012&#x27;s cinematic dregs &#x22;Ghost Rider:
Spirit of Vengeance&#x22; and &#x22;The Grey&#x22; as worst films of the year.<br /><br />Forget coherency, structure and reasoning; there&#x27;s very little of that
to be found here at all. Trying to make sense of the on screen
happenings is futile. It&#x27;s a movie that was assembled without a
discernible plot, seemingly making itself up as it goes along only to
be later edited by a drunk monkey. Characterization is at a minimum,
some characters coming into frame with little or no introduction
whatsoever- you&#x27;ll find yourself wondering &#x22;Who the hell is that and
where did they come from?&#x22; quite often. Certain stretches of dialogue
were apparently so bad that the filmmakers just drowned it out with
thunderous original music or sound effects. The effects work is
serviceable, though nothing really groundbreaking- an early showdown
with a Chimera and a the climactic arrival of &#x22;Kronos&#x22; would be amongst
the few FX highlights. There&#x27;s a scene involving a Minotaur which seems
tacked on as an afterthought and reeks of ineptitude.<br /><br />Sam Worthington is more self aware here than in the first installment-
he&#x27;s at least trying. Rosamund Pike is cast as the obligatory eye
candy, though I must say that I found myself missing Gemma Arterton
quite a bit. Ralph Feinnes, Liam Neeson and Danny Huston return from
the first film and put in small amounts of solid acting work, it&#x27;s a
shame to see them wasted in this way, though. Bill Nighy (in a brief
appearance) and Toby Kebbell (&#x22;War Horse&#x22;, &#x22;Rock N Rolla&#x22;) steal their
limited amount of screen-time. Edgar Ramirez (IFC&#x27;s Miniseries
&#x22;Carlos&#x22;) plays the central villain here and only conveys a minimal
amount of presence.<br /><br />The film is 99 minutes long and I can only remember about 5 minutes of
that being worthwhile. Needless to say, skip this mutha! 4.0 out of 10
