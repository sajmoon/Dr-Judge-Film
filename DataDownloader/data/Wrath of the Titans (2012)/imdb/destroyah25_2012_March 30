Just finished watching wrath of the titans, and have to say it was
better than expected. I was expecting a somewhat average film after the
disappointing remake of the original. All the characters played their
roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d,
and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling
rocks, Pegasus flying, and other scenes had a strong presence with the
3d. A couple weaknesses I saw in my opinion were the character
representations of Hephestus and Hades toward the end. Hephestus was
seemed to be way scrawnier, too good looking, not serious enough, and
too weak for a god. He was a solid character just wish they made him
more represented to how he was in myth. Also without spoiling the
character change of Hades toward the end was a little interesting, but
felt it shouldn&#x27;t have been done. The effects were in this movie were
awesome especially for Cronus. It also has some great fight scenes that
really get you blood pumping. All in all though it was a great action
film, with some solid comedy relief, and just a great overall film
especially for those looking for flashy effects 8/10
