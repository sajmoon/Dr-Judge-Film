OMG!!! I just came from seeing this one and I can not being more
embarrassed of taking my friends to see this. It is just so bad movie
that I made me laugh. <br /><br />I really enjoyed the first one. At least it has some storyline an
decent interpretation by the GODS. However, this one lacks in every
department. Only the CGI stands in the movie which is was really well
done. Same for them for working on this s***. <br /><br />Why SAM has an Australian accent!! Holy molly!! Someone in Hollywood
must be really in love with this guy to still give him work. Is worse
than a bad actor. He does not transfer any feeling at all. <br /><br />Do not waste your money. Rent Hercules at amazon or whatever. At least
is far away better Greek movie than this. <br /><br />I am still shocked!!!
