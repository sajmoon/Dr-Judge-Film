Perseus is back in this sequel to the 2010 poorly received remake of
the 1984 classic, &#x22;Clash of the Titans&#x22;. A decade has passed since his
heroic defeat of the Kraken and things have changed a bit for Perseus
and friends. However, just when he was about to have a good life, evil
calls him back again to fight once more in an attempt alongside the
gods to defeat the evil Titan lord, Kronos, from devouring the gods and
obliterating all of mankind. <br /><br />&#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22; takes place a decade after the conclusion of the
2010 remake, so there&#x27;s a slight change in life. Perseus is now a
father and due to the death of his wife Io, a lone parent of
10-year-old-soon-to-be-hero Helius. After refusing the offer to given a
rank between the gods of Olympus, he lives a quiet life as a fisherman
with his son. Besides Perseus, Princess Andromeda is now Queen
Andromeda and a fighter. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the gods are facing a crisis. Hades (god of the underworld)
and Ares (god of war) have teamed up with Kronos, leader of the Titans.
They had made a deal with him and to release him from Tartarus. To
power up Kronos, they captured Zeus and drained him of his energy to
feed Kronos, thus awakening him. If they successfully awaken Kronos,
Kronos would then proceed to kill Zeus and his friends, and obliterate
all of mankind in an attempt to rule the world once more. <br /><br />Just like its predecessor, this movie offers a lot of intense action
sequences. This is one improvement from its predecessor, having more
intense fighting scenes. There are many fights here, conducted between
Perseus and many different creatures from the Greek myths. There&#x27;s a
fight between Perseus and the Minotaur in the labyrinth, a battle with
a gigantic Cyclops, and many more battles with two-headed winged
creatures, two-body-in-one monsters, and of course, the lava-fueled
gigantic debris-coated Kronos for the climax. And add in the
outstanding visual effects to enhance the action sequences. Anyone
who&#x27;s looking forward to violence will be pleased with this perfect
blend of exciting action scenes and sophisticated visual effects. <br /><br />Talking about effects, let&#x27;s talk about the 3D. The first film, being
heavily marketed as a must- see 3D event, had dreadful 3D effects.
Added as an afterthought, the 3D is just painful and does nothing to
the film except charge the viewer some extra bucks. I was skeptical of
watching it in 3D for this movie, but it seems the producers and crew
have spent more time and paid more attention to the 3D effects of the
film. The 3D here is a vast, massive improvement from the dreadful 3D
effects of the first film. Occasionally, some of the items shown pop
out of the screen. If you hated the 3D of the first film, reconsider
before deciding to watch this film whether in 3D or not because the 3D
here is just excellent. <br /><br />When it gets to story, this movie lacks at it. It has a simple plot
that the movie rarely hangs on to. But that&#x27;s not a problem, the movie
does not aim to be a film with an intriguing, complex, sophisticated,
mind-boggling plot, it aims to be a spectacular, eclectic mix of
special effects and action scenes. The dialog is fairly simple, the
acting was fair, and the plot was just not complicated. <br /><br />Nevertheless, &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22; is a considerable improvement from
the horrible 2010 remake of the 1984 classic. It has plenty of action
sequences accompanied with dazzling visual effects for teenage boys to
enjoy, excellent 3D effects for enhanced excitement, and a little bit
of focus on the storyline to get things going. If you&#x27;re anyone of the
people who want to have some fun watching countless violent scenes and
dazzling visual effects, have this movie a go. But if you&#x27;re anyone
who&#x27;s more interested in seeing a movie with an intriguing plot and
some more focus on the storyline, give this film a miss. <br /><br />Rating: 7/10<br /><br />Final Verdict: &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22; is a vast improvement from the
poor remake of the 1984 fantasy that offers plenty of action sequences,
dazzling visual effects, satisfying 3D effects, and a little bit of
storyline to get things going.
