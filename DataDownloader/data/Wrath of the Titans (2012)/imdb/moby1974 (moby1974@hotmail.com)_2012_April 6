2012_April 6 
Just seen it and its just what you would think this sort of movie would
be like. Its not going to blow you away with its script or acting but I
would never go into this kind of filming thinking that, what it does is
grab you and pull you along on a good old action fantasy film. Better
than the first film in both scope/effects/and wow factor. The story is
all it needs to be, good vs bad blah blah. Looks wise the film is very
good, its all done very well and no real &#x22;oh dear did they run out of
money&#x22; moments, in fact I am a bit shocked at how much they put in, I
mean normally its action/talk/action/talk....big end fight, but this
time once the film gets going the action is almost none stop and if not
wowing you with action then is giving you great spectacle of the
underworld and the beautiful landscapes they travel along. I think if
you take it for what it is this is a very good movie, it gives you
action and entertainment by the bucket load. I gave it 9 out of 10,
high for me but I score a film on what it has achieved, it does not set
out to try and be something its not, its just a simple straight in
there action fantasy film.........and a bloody good one at that. Oh one
thing I did not like....the music is great but there is one fight where
you can hear some electric guitar ahem! not really fitting.
