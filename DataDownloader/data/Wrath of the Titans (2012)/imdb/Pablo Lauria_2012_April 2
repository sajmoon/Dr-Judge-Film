When you go to see a big budget movie plenty of good actors, the less
you expect is to see this awful idiotic movie. First of all, someone
should tell Sam Worthington he needs to speak with neutral accent. It
is not a Mad Max Sequel. Agenor character looks like a Rastafarian that
escaped from a Pirate movie. Looks like this movie was made for a
different kind of public than the first one. The characters are not
well developed and it is impossible to feel empathy for any of them.
Rosamund Pike deserves better. The rest of the cast don&#x27;t deliver
anything to remember. If we add that the movie doesn&#x27;t worth 3D effects
there is nothing left.
