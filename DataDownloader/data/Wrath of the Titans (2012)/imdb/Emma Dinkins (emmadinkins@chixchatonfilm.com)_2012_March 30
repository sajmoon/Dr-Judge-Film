The Wrath of the Titans came with action right out the gates of
Tartarus. I was a little surprised that the fun began so quickly, but
it didn&#x27;t last. We get this great battle as Perseus (Sam Worthington)
faces the Chimera, and then we are taken to school for a Greek
mythology lesson. This film does look deeper at the Gods, specifically
the relationship of the top brothers. The three major Gods seen in the
Clash of the Titans have returned, including Liam Neeson as Zeus.
Fortunately, his role is so much more expanded this time around and not
completely defined by one catch phrase. Releasing the Titans was
exactly what takes place in this story and it is pretty spectacular to
witness. Practically every mythical creature ever conceived in Greek
mythology was on display and in some battle with Perseus. Since he
pretty much lost everyone who fought beside him the last time he now
teams up with some new comrades, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who is
leading the Greek army into battle and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who is a
bit of a scoundrel. The entire film took a very somber serious tone, I
kept thinking man this is dramatic. It wasn&#x27;t until well into the 99
minutes running time that we get some comic relief from Hephaestus
(Bill Nighy). The tone lightened up for a minute, then Ares (Edgar
Ramirez) makes a really cool entrance and then into the labyrinth we
go, which was absolutely stunning. I was very impressed by the special
effects in this film. Aside from how realistic all the titans appeared,
a few other things crossed my mind, one that I really liked and the
other I considered must have been for realism. This series is the first
time that I have seen Pegasus as a black beauty, which coordinated very
well with how dirty everyone stayed throughout the entire film. In
battle who has time for a shower before, &#x27;action&#x27;! Good thing Perseus
is a demi-god otherwise he would have never survived all the times that
he was hurled into a rock or a stone pillar. This story is not plot
driven, it&#x27;s not character driven and with all the different accents in
Greece, which were a bit distracting, but if a film could stand solely
on the special effects and the realism that you would expect in the
chance that you meet a Cyclops then this it that film. It was
entertaining, I&#x27;m a Greek mythology fan and I give it a green light.
