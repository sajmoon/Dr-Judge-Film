Let me start by saying that I loved this movie. Those who are
complaining about the story are just being overly critical. That is the
critics job. The story is easily enough understood. Perseus is trying
to stop the titans to protect his son. Simple as that. The action
scenes and CGI are fantastic and the final battle will blow you away.
There are many references to Greek mythology and this movie lets you
see more of the gods and their awesome powers. The only reason this
gets a nine is because the 3-D kind of sucks, but who cares? So, if
your not nit-picky about the story, don&#x27;t care about 3-D, and love
action, then go and see this movie now!
