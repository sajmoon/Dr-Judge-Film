2012_April 2 
I was waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer for the first
time. Although the trailer sparked high expectations but the movie
turned out to be below average. Except for the special effects,
everything else is dull. I was yawing by the time movie approached the
interval. There is no story line. In fact there is nothing much to
mention to you about this movie. I feel so bored even to write a review
about this movie. Bottomline, if you are interested in exchanging your
large disposable income for some special effects, give it a try. But if
you are looking for value, stay away. I wish there are no sequels to
this series.
