Usually, the first film of a series is the best one. However, we have
the opposite here. &#x27;Wrath of the Titans&#x27;(the sequel) was much better
than &#x27;Clash of the Titans&#x27;(the first film) for several reasons.<br /><br />The first of them is the technical aspects. &#x27;Wrath of the Titans&#x27;
presents us thrilling action sequences that really involve the
audience. Director Jonathan Liebesman used his camera in a similar way
that he did in his last film Battle Los Angeles to make us feel part of
the action &#x96; actually, pretty close of it. Sometimes his camera shakes
and shows a wide view of what is happening in a particular scene &#x96; like
the final battle when &#x27;Cronos&#x27; is coming out of the underworld and
everything explodes (just fantastic!) Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see it in
IMAX, but it must be a visually stunning experience.<br /><br />The other aspect is the plot. In the first film, the writers seemed to
want us to take the story too serious &#x96; in fact with such a silly plot,
it was almost impossible. Wrath of the Titans has a much more pleasant
story with some humorous parts &#x96; just one or two, but it really breaks
the ice. Also, we feel that it was written for pure entertainment.<br /><br />However, just the fact that it is better than the first one doesn&#x27;t
make it spectacular. We still have the same silly plot &#x96; which can be
told in a couple of lines &#x96; and an unconvincing performance by Sam
Worthington who just doesn&#x27;t look like a semi god. The role need much
stronger not only in physical appearance but in personality too (Henry
Cavill, who has recently done Theseus in &#x27;Immortals&#x27; would be much
better for this kind of role).<br /><br />Between these pros and cons, we have a film aimed purely for those who
want an enjoyable time with friends or boyfriend/girlfriend. Not the
biggest hit of the moment &#x96; but not as bad as expected.
