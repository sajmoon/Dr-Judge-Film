This film is not recommended.<br /><br />The Kraken has been released and is now dead and gone! But there are
still other monsters afoot in this flat-footed tale called Wrath of the
Titans. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Wrath of the Titans again has
those irate gods and evil demons creating havoc upon us mere mortals. <br /><br />To call this film a Greek tragedy would a breach of honesty, giving
over to the misconception that this odyssey is an important and
stirring drama of epic proportions. But it truly is a tragedy, in the
sense that it wastes the talents of all the actors and filmmakers
involved in this project. One can however say, in all honesty, that
this film does fill one with awe, in the sense that it is awful, and
that is certainly a more accurate assessment of this movie fantasy.<br /><br />In this worthless sequel to the unworthy Clash of the Titans, Perseus (
Sam Worthington ), son of Zeus ( Liam Neeson ) and a mortal mom, is now
a peaceful fisherman and loving father. He is called to duty to protect
his godly dad from his sinister Uncle Hades ( Ralph Fiennes ) and Zeus&#x27;
other son, Ares ( Edgar Ramirez ) who want to take over his kingdom and
throne. Revenge and jealousy runs rampant up this genealogical family
tree.<br /><br />That&#x27;s the basic plot with plenty of action sequences, middling special
effects, and other slight of hand tricks at work. The script by
committee is mediocre and dull, lacking any excitement, energy or wit.
The dialog is just plain dumb. Any moviegoers&#x27; wrath should be aimed
directly at the film&#x27;s writers: Dan Mazeau, David Johnson, and Greg
Berlanti. ( One howling example of bad dialogue: Hades says to Zeus:
&#x22;You look 10,000 years younger!&#x22; )<br /><br />The direction by Jonathan Liebesman is nearly non-existent as his film
plods from one set piece to the next with no real pacing or rhythm. The
editing is clumsy and pieced together at such a frenzied rate that it
is sometimes impossible to really see the action or special effects
properly. Battle scenes are awkwardly photographed and staged. The
photography is dimly lit by Ben Davis with some scenes just plain ugly
and seemingly out of focus, shocking inept, especially coming from a
major motion picture studio and their larger budget. ( Beware the Gods,
Warner Brothers! ). <br /><br />None of the actors, who have all done better work elsewhere, are
believable or credible in their roles, but they are all laughable in
their grim serious tones and hammy theatrics. Worthington, usually a
charismatic actor, is puffy and bland this time around, Neeson and
Fiennes pontificate rather than speak and delivery their lines without
any true sense of passion, and Ramirez looks pouty more than angry. He
also talks sporadically with a thick Spanish accent that clashes with
the mostly British cast, and he&#x27;s not Titan either. Also on hand in
this version are: Rosamund Pike as Andromeda who fills her battle armor
well, Bill Nighy as a crazed Hephaestus who seems to have walked into
the movie thinking he was part of a Monty Python remake, and Toby
Kebbell as Agenor, son of Posideon and, perhaps, the illegitimate child
of Russell Brand. So, I guess, on that issue of acting, it may have
been a more difficult feat of acting given their one-dimensional
characters and their hysterics. At least, they manage to keep a
straight face in all this goofiness. But on second thought, the
outtakes may have been more enjoyable. <br /><br />A fantasy film that relies heavily on its CGI needs to make sure its
creatures and make-up are top-notch if the audience is going to believe
in its cinematic power. The effects here are of the hit-and-miss
variety ( the good: the Chimera, the Cyclops, and the maze-like walls
of Hades; the bad: Pegasus, the Minotaur, and practically everything
else, especially Kronos the Lava Man ).<br /><br />I know what you&#x27;re thinking...It&#x27;s only a kiddie fantasy adventure
movie. Give it some slack! No, I can&#x27;t! I will continue to fight the
Battle of Banality that is being served as entertainment nowadays. My
quest to rid the world of dreck like this is an on-going battle lately.
( Remember I was served heaping helpings of John Carter and Mirror,
Mirror in these past weeks! What a dismal start to this movie season so
far. ) Wrath of the Titans is an absolute waste of your time and
hard-earned money. Avoid it like the Kraken! <br /><br />As the movie tagline states or warns us: &#x22;Feel the Wrath!&#x22; Oh, on that
you can be sure! How true, oh Great Zeus, how true! GRADE: C-<br /><br />NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com
