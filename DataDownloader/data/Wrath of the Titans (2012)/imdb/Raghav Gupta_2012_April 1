2012_April 1 
its summer time.. the critics would now have their bashing pens ready
to dismiss any attempt to entertain. i however have my popcorn n soda
ready and want to sit back and enjoy things blowing up. OK so i&#x27;d read
a few reviews and seen a few ratings for this movie before going for
it. was forced to go really after the sad reviews. expected it to be as
bad as its predecessor. was i wrong. this movie is brilliant in your
face action. some story in the middle. enough to keep things connected.
its sad when people go for movies like these expecting a masterpiece
like &#x27;the godfather&#x27;. hey if stupid action movies are not your thing
then please don&#x27;t go for such movies. let people like us who watch
movies to be entertained and not give us a lesson on life watch them. i
especially loved the 3D in this movie. a lot of times i come out of a
3D feeling dizzy and ripped off. but not this time. the scenes in the
underworld are too damn cool in 3D. not to mention the awesome demons
from the chimera to the cyclopses. and please respect the premise of
the movie and enjoy it rather than thinking &#x22;why did he do this and not
that?&#x22; &#x22;how does this work?&#x22; &#x22;gods can die?&#x22;. so go watch this movie if
u want to enjoy a no brainer full blown action film. else wait for
titanic 3D next weekend.<br /><br />my first review. thanks for reading. :)
