To me,this is the season of terrible movies.And &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22;
is an exception.I mean this is not as terrible as recent movies like
GR2.This has got some awesome 3d effects and fully packed action.But a
good plot is absent.The direction,dialogues and performances from
actors are so good that it doesn&#x27;t let you think more on the plot.In
comparison with the first part,Clash of the titans can be ranked
better.Its because the the first part has got a lot of interesting
characters and a plot which is OK.Anyway a good effort has been put
forward by the team which makes the movie a good one.So an overall of 7
is well deserved for this movie.
