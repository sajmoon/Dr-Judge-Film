Although Clash of the Titans was universally dismissed as an
overwhelming disappointment &#x96; and featured the worst post-converted 3D
ever &#x96; it raked in the big bucks and a sequel was naturally green-lit
by Warner Bros. With a new director (Battle LA&#x27;s Jonathan Liebesman
replacing Louis Leterrier) and an extra $25m to toy with, Wrath was
given the opportunity to learn from its predecessor&#x27;s mistakes. Alas,
this loud and sporadically entertaining mess largely fails to deliver;
Sam Worthington&#x27;s acting again doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard, the action is
well-choreographed but repetitive, and the CGI remains below par
considering the dosh thrown at it. However, it&#x27;s the lack of
imagination and unpredictability in the plot department that truly
stifles the proceedings. If you get to the end of the first act and
don&#x27;t already know how the rest of the movie is going to play out,
you&#x27;re probably sleeping. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes spice things up
as Zeus and Hades respectively, and Toby Kebbell&#x27;s comic sidekick is a
successful ploy to inject the humour sorely missing from Clash, but
it&#x27;s not enough to make this misfire recommendable.
