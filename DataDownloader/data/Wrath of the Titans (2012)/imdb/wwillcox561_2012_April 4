Wrath of the Titans was a pretty decent movie. I happen to think that
it was only slightly better than Clash of the Titans for a couple
reasons. To start off with, the CGI was amazing and on point. The
fighting sequences were significantly better than its predecessor.
Perseus is a great character who is probably one of the only characters
that actually has some depth to their acting besides Liam Neeson. I
feel like this makes a pretty good story using Greek mythology except
that they didn&#x27;t provide enough background information on other
important gods. The only real problem that i had with this movie was
that I saw it in 3D. It wasn&#x27;t used as well as I thought it might be.
Towards the end of the movie my eye&#x27;s began to strain and instead of
enjoying the awesome action scene I developed a headache.
