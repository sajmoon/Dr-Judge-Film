&#x27;Clash of the Titans,&#x27; which graced silver screen in April of 2010, was
reviled by critics and fans of the 1981 original a-like. The script was
a mess and the converted 3-D looked, well, converted. It&#x27;d only make
sense that such a travesty was met with poor results at the box
office?Nope. &#x27;Clash&#x27; was one of the highest grossing movies of 2010
and, inevitably, launched a sequel in the hopes of duping a few more
simple minded people into making a buck.<br /><br />Now, to clear things up, I had not seen the 2010 version, and don&#x27;t
plan on it based on what I&#x27;ve heard. So I went into this sequel without
much of a back story. This shouldn&#x27;t ruin my movie-going experience, as
I had seen movies like &#x27;Terminator 2&#x27; and &#x27;Aliens&#x27; without viewing the
originals beforehand.<br /><br />The story was a mess. Plot elements didn&#x27;t add up or happened too
conveniently. Characters traveled places that weren&#x27;t well explained
(sometimes barely at all) and I was often left scratching my head,
wondering where they were or how they got there. Most of the plot
points that I felt perplexed on, I figured it was because I hadn&#x27;t seen
the first film. But these moments kept repeating while I was watching
it, until I finally gave up all thought of making sense of the story.<br /><br />Nothing irritates me more than clich&#xE9;s piling up and, oh boy, did this
movie have it&#x27;s share. Perseus (a dull Sam Worthington, which is a
nearly a clich&#xE9; in its own right) has left his heroic days behind and
become a fishermen in a local village. Of course, just like every other
story ever written, the would-be pacifist is called back into arms for
the greater good. And, what&#x27;s that? There&#x27;s a child as well! His son!
How convenient! But I doubt they&#x27;ll us him in the climatic fight, as a
emotional weakness for the bad guy to exploit. That would never happen!
Oh, and the over-the-top hostile, misunderstood criminal at the
beginning story is magical transformed into a hero by the end. How
creative! <br /><br />The more I think about this movie, the more my anger swells inside me,
like a hurricane of hatred being forged in the deep depths of the
ocean, ready to explode into a fury of rage and destruction over all in
it&#x27;s path. So, I&#x27;ll leave it as this, if you somehow (and I use that
term very lightl) enjoyed the 2010 &#x27;Clash of the Titans,&#x27; you might
want to check this turd out. Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your time or
money on this pile of junk.
