I thought Clash of the Titans was OK but the 3D was terrible so i had
high hopes for the sequel. I am so disappointed. This film in all
honesty was poor.There is not much left to be said. The story was poor
i was confused at times, scenes moved very quickly, no character
development just a lot of noise &#x26; FIRE! FIRE was everywhere.I guess
that is not a surprise as the title poster shows this. I can see where
they spent the budget. Shame because gods, Greek mythology and all that
are good subjects to make a movie about. Sam Worthington slept walked
through the 1 1/2 hours and Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes characters
were useless.Rosemund Pike no better.
