I didn&#x27;t expect to have such a good time with Wrath of the Titans, at
the same time it could achieve everything that its predecessor had
tried without any success. 2 years ago, the remake of Clash of the
Titans was a tedious parade of visual excesses and uninteresting
characters. As a consequence, the expectations I had before watching
its sequel Wrath of the Titans were very low; however, this film
returns to the well told narrative, measured humor and heroic spirit
from the &#x27;80s adventure cinema, and even though it&#x27;s far from being
great, it&#x27;s very entertaining without insulting our intelligence, and
it makes us be interested in the characters.<br /><br />The main pro from the screenplay of Wrath of the Titans is that it
brings us a clear and comprehensible narrative arc, which touches the
bases of the classic heroic narratives...the call to action, the
recruitment of allies, the supernatural help...in summary, nothing new,
but enough well structured in order to capture our interest. I also
liked the humor employed by co-screenwriters Dan Mazeau and David
Johnson, and I&#x27;m not only talking about the comic-relief characters
Agenor and Hephaestus, but also about the naughty tone which lightens
the &#x22;Greek drama&#x22; (literally) a little bit without losing the gravity
of the situation. The special effects are excellent, and I also
appreciated the fact that they are used in order to be auxiliaries of
the narrative, and not as apparatus arbitrary exhibitions which
interrupt the story&#x27;s flow. But don&#x27;t worry...we still have a big
number of explosions, creatures and epic battles with a scale which
isn&#x27;t common to find in films with a medium budget. Director Jonathan
Liebesman (another reason why this movie pleasantly surprised...his
previous films were the deplorable Darkness Falls, the boring The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning and the mediocre Battle Los Angeles)
understood where to invest the money in order to achieve the maximum
impact and entertainment.<br /><br />In the leading role, Sam Worthington feels a bit bland, but his
character is much better written than in the first movie, because his
motivation is much more tangible and real, and his relationship with
his father is more sincere and realistic. Liam Neeson perfectly
balances the divine power of his character with his humanity; and I
also liked Rosamund Pike&#x27;s performance.<br /><br />On the negative side, even though the screenplay is generally well
written, it also includes a few passages and characters which are a bit
confusing; in fact, I was given the impression that Wrath of the Titans
was hurriedly re-edited in order to make it more agile, breaking the
flow from some scenes as a consequence. That&#x27;s not a very important
fail, and it certainly didn&#x27;t ruin the movie, but it &#x22;took me out&#x22; of
the film in a few occasions. Nevertheless, I surprisingly enjoyed Wrath
of the Titans pretty much, and I can recommend it as a very
entertaining experience, which despite not being excellent, is hugely
superior to the first film.
