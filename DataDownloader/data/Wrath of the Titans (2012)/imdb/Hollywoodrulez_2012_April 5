I&#x27;ll get the thing that bothered me out of the way first. Persius goes
through a lot in the story only to have Zeus die on him anyway right
that is a kick in the sack big time. Other than that the film romped
the first one in terms of story and style. The main antagonist lasted
at least more than a minute this time round and it was a far more
elaborate battle scene. The visual effects were mind-blowing and done
with such profession for that I commend you guys very good job. I
thought the stand out death scene went to the actress who played Karina
whom I would have loved to see more of. The costume dept done a really
great job too but it was the effects and directing that sold this one
for me.
