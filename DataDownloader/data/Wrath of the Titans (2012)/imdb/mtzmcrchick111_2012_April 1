i came watching this movie with relatively low expectations but it was
worse than i ever thought it would be. yes the titans look cool and
there&#x27;s action but it is completely lacking almost everything else.
There is hardly any emotion, you don&#x27;t really come to like the
characters, it wasn&#x27;t a good story, all i can really say is that it was
just dry. It looks cool n everything but it didn&#x27;t move me in any kind
of way. This is probably why there coming out with old classics showing
in the movie theaters cause Hollywood is running out of ideas and they
have nothing better to show. They barely make movies like they used
to....
