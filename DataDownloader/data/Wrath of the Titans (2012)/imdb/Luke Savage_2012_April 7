The beginning of the story started out with a very good interesting
setup. The boys, the father, and a father&#x27;s yearning for acceptance
from his son. However, as the movie continued, it lacked imagination
and was predictable. By the end, I met the &#x27;cheesy&#x27; side of the movie
and was uncomfortable to even bare. This movie started out well but
lacked the complexity of keeping imagination alive. Plot weakened
throughout and all that was left was fighting and a rated B movie. <br /><br />Acting was fine as these actors are experienced and believable.
However, even great actors have their limits and felt that the whole
story became unbelievable. Save your money, wait until it hits Redbox.
