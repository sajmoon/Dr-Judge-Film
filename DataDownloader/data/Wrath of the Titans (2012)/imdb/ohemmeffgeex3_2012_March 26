SPOILER FREE REVIEW<br /><br />Let me start this right off the bat and tell you it&#x27;s better than Clash
of the Titans(Even though that&#x27;s not saying much)However, Wrath of the
Titans supplies enough action set pieces, that you have a good enough
flick that you should check out this weekend. The plot is very simple,
it&#x27;s set 10 years after the events of the first film where Perseus and
his son fish for a living. Hades and Zeus&#x27; son Ares trick Zeus and
capture him. Now, the titans are getting stronger while Zeus is getting
weaker. Perseus has to go to hell to save his father. There are some
pretty cool monsters in this film, like the demons Makhai and the scene
with Kronos is AMAZING. If you&#x27;re looking for a good time this weekend
and go into this movie with an open mind. Then you will definitely have
a good time watching Wrath of the Titans. 8/10
