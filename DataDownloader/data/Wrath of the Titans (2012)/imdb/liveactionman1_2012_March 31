Wrath of the Titans is directed by Jonathan Lebesman, you know the guy
who made that god awful &#x27;Battle L.A&#x27;, Lebesmen has seemed to of caught
Transformers syndrome where in the recipe to make a movie he seems to
have forgotten the all too important part..a STORY, which since i last
checked is quite a important part of a movie.<br /><br />This movie only seems to exist because the directors thought since they
already made a first movie with character development,interactions and
relationships that they could skip that and go straight to the action.
The only problem with this is that the first movie was completely
forgettable, ask anyone what they remember from the first movie and
they will say &#x22;uurrrm RELEASE THE KRAKEN, and they f-ing killed the
kraken to bloody fast&#x22;, and that&#x27;s all. The whole movie is based on the
fact that when people stop praying to gods they lose their power, and
that kind of reminded me of all those bad Santa movies were when
children stop believing he would lose his power. Anyways, the story
revolves around Sam Werthington&#x27;s character Perseus, which luckily
enough happens to live in a small fishing village just outside where
all the action happens. Zeus played once again by Liam Neeson, requests
Perseus to help him, because the gods are having a cry that people
don&#x27;t believe in them. As a result of this, Hades (Ralph Fiennes),
attempts to steal Zeus&#x27; power which for some reason would waken kronos.
The only way to stop this from happening YOU GUESSED IT, is to go on a
quest to find three fragments that when put together would could stop
Kronos, and that&#x27;s about all I could get before my brain stopped
functioning properly.<br /><br />The movie plays out much like a video game going from one set peace to
another, only changing after Sam Werthington has killed something big
and loud. He is joined by Toby Kebbell&#x27;s character Agenor who is there
only as comic relief BUT ISN&#x27;T FUNNY, and .... okay let me just rant
about this for a bit, Rosamund Pike, the only female character in this
movie, for no f-ing reason is the leader of a large army, she only
exists as a love interest for Perseus, she apart from that contributes
nothing to this movie her acting is terrible, and he character is ill-
written. And for her army They are merely things to kill for the
various monsters that Sam and his merry men happen to bump into on
there quest. <br /><br />Some action sequences are cool I guess, but with no real understanding
of why any of this is happening kinda feel deflated. As i watched the
movie i began too realise, how much alike this movie is with the
&#x27;Immortals&#x27; (story wise), and how much I liked the &#x27;Immortals&#x27;. The
acting was solid, the story while no God Father was decent and the
action scenes were so over the top, bloody, balls-to-the-walls fun that
even a 90 year old philosophy teacher would shed a smile. <br /><br />Too summaries, if you want to go watch this movie i suggest going to
the store and buying Immortals. It is just superior in every way,
thanks for reading.
