It really is &#x27;amazing&#x27; to see Hollywood, gushing at vapid garbage all
the time, to only turn its back, and put up its nose, on this excellent
treatment of an epic tale. <br /><br />I have never seen such a great movie bashed so much on its opening
weekend since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and we all know why the
media was so busy weighing in on that one. <br /><br />This is as good as Lord of the Rings- perhaps even better considering
original source material. So it gets me wondering, why is the media
machine taking a crap on this movie? <br /><br />Is it because, like Battlestar Galactica, Caprica, Rome (HBO), the
movies in this series expose the American imagination to polytheism? Is
it because there&#x27;s no Orc (arab) stand-ins?
