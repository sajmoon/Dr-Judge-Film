The 2010 version of Clash of the Titans replaces the magic from the
original film to a more epic tone. It suppose to be cool but it spends
most of the time explaining things and making some senseless drama.
Wrath of the Titans tries to be bigger than the first film. It can be
fun, but it gets boring when we go to the characters. The script didn&#x27;t
give any depth or life to them. Some performances saves it but it still
feel lifeless. The action is exciting but we don&#x27;t get much of it and
it&#x27;s pretty shaky in a clumsy way. Wrath of the Titans tends to improve
the mistakes, but some of its flaws just got worse.<br /><br />Weak character development is one thing that troubles most in this
series though it&#x27;s an action film and nobody is here for the
characters, but sometimes it kind of enervates the joys of fighting
giant monsters and senseless explosions. The cast sort of improves the
characters. Sam Worthington may not give his character a lot of
personality but his physicality works best. But I still think he is a
miscast as Perseus. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are predictably good.
Bill Nighy is just delightful to watch.<br /><br />The action is pretty good but it gets boring when there&#x27;s not. The film
itself is totally lifeless. The action just brought some of it to life.
The film still suffers with bad drama and subplots that are definitely
unavoidable. The story doesn&#x27;t make any sense though. The best is the
CGI. It makes the movie big and exciting. Excessive explosions and
flames is what all action movie lovers came here for. Unfortunately,
not all the action were well played. Shaky camera is suppose to bring
some momentum but it&#x27;s too close and it doesn&#x27;t have a decent shot.
There are also pointless fight scenes especially the Minotaur. The
monster looks good though. We get to see a lot of awesome giant
monsters. The climax here is longer than the first movie. It&#x27;s all fun
but it ends up making no sense. This is usual in action films these
days which is sad.<br /><br />I guess people are going to enjoy this for the action. Greek Mythology
fans might find it interesting by the visuals and portrayal of the
setting but the story and the script are weak. It could have been so
much better but the awfulness of its flaws kind of ruined the
enjoyment. It&#x27;s not entirely bad but it&#x27;s just unsatisfying and
lifeless. It may be action packed and all but it&#x27;s perfectly bland.
Everything has its limits.
