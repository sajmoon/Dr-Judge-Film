This is really a bad movie. The plot is really poor. The only elements
which , only for few minutes, did capture my attention were related to
the special efx....nothing else....totally empty movie... This is kind
of spoiling old Greek mythology. It is so superficial that it become
pathetic most of the time. The only positive side is that here and
there some location are quite amazing. The sound track is not
memorable. I really do not understand how come this movie has earned so
much !!?? Were is it&#x27;s value ? What is so great in putting together a
bunch of special effects with million of dollars and hundreds of people
working on it. I suggest to spend your money differently.
