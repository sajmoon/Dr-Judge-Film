Wrath of the Titans (review by Jonathan McMillan) Studio: Warner Bros.
Run time: 99 minutes.<br /><br />Plot: Perseus braves the treacherous underworld to rescue his father,
Zeus, captured by his son, Ares, and brother Hades who unleash the
ancient Titans upon the world..<br /><br />Cast: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Rosamund Pike<br /><br />Rating: Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and
action<br /><br />Bottom Line: ***<br /><br />Review : I have to admit I was very apprehensive when I got the call to
review the screening of this sequel to the 2010 lackluster remake.
Although the first movie was somewhat entertaining, it didn&#x27;t live up
to the expectations of my 10 year inner-child who fell in love with the
1981 original. As a matter of fact in my review of that film I stated
that remaking the cult classic was a classic example of not knowing
when to quit while you&#x27;re ahead.<br /><br />And to top it off, in an attempt to capitalize on the success that
Avatar, the producers of 2010s remake added 3D effects in
post-production which made the movie a visual train wreck that was
absolutely torturous to watch. However after seeing the trailer to
Wrath of the Titans, my interest was piqued by the scope of the special
effects and the hopes that Warner Bros. studio learned from their
mistakes.<br /><br />I&#x27;m very glad to say; my hopes were not dashed.<br /><br />Finally, movie making technology has advanced to do justice to the
stories that the Greek storytellers captured our imaginations with for
thousands of years. Wrath of the Titans is 99 minutes of 3D computer
generated imagery that accurately projects on screen what the world of
&#x22;gods and titans&#x22; must have looked like. Rather than the original
intent of the Greek myths to serve as moral parables, the plot of Wrath
of the Titans serves only to show the truly awesome capabilities of
what Hollywood technology can do now-a-days. The cinematography renders
astonishing beautiful landscapes upon which two- headed fire spewing
monsters and the sort, wreck havoc and attempt to kill our Perseus (Sam
Worthington of Avatar) and his crew.<br /><br />Technically the film is about Perseus&#x27; heroes journeys to save the
Olympian gods Zeus, Possiden and Hades (respectively played by super
actors: Liam Neeson, Danny Huston and Ralph Fiennes) from the wrath of
their mythological father the titan Cronos.<br /><br />Nevermind the plot and it&#x27;s stars though. The movie really is just a
vehicle showcasing a world of amazingly &#x22;realistic&#x22; rendered one-eyed
creatures 20 stories tall called cyclops&#x27; who attempt to smash our
protagonists with towering tree trunks. A world where a half man/ half
bull creature called a minotaur stalks our hero&#x27;s in a bafflingly
M.C,Escher-esque ever shifting labyrinth. I whole-heartedly believe
scenes like these are what todays 3D technology is made for.<br /><br />Unlike the 2010 movie, the audience which will enjoy this movie will be
broader than (as I said in my last review) &#x22;a very specific target
audience &#x96; those made of snips of snails and puppy dog tails&#x22; because
the CGI and 3D special effects are so awesome that this movie is
overall, very entertaining. Don&#x27;t look for it on the the list of Best
Picture nominees during Academy Award season, however I wouldn&#x27;t be
surprised if it did win some Oscars in some of the technical
categories.
