2012_April 2 
I tried to enjoy this for the mindless action quotient &#x26; I still found
myself disappointed. The film had great CGI creations, but on a whole
the CGI alone couldn&#x27;t save this film from being a turkey. Bad acting,
bad plot and poor performances from a cast that could have been
stellar. I&#x27;ve seen virtually all of the actors in other features where
they far outshine the performances that were given in this film. In my
opinion I&#x27;d say that you should wait for Netflix...this is another in
the long line of over hyped huge budgeted cash grabs that Hollywood has
become known for lately. Things are certainly disheartening when the
executives that green light these films keep their jobs &#x26; the art of
great film gets shoved aside for profit.
