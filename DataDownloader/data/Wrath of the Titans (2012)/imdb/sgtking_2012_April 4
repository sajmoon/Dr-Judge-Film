As effects become more advanced, more epic films are made each year.
This is a double-edged sword. Some are simply style over substance and
will be forgotten quickly. Others manage to rise above that and
standout. The 2010 remake of &#x27;Clash of the Titans&#x27; did quite well
financially and OK critically. There never was a sequel to the 1981
original, but in this day and age if a film is a success it&#x27;s
inevitable. This was exciting news since there is much more Greek
mythology to cover. It took couple years, but the story continues and
the result is quite good.<br /><br />Pros: Good work by the cast. Pretty good score. Grand production and
costume designs. Impressive effects. Fast pace. A few exciting action
sequences. More obstacles for our characters this time out.<br /><br />Cons: Lacking in plot. Some irritating shaky cam moments. Some bad
dialogue here and there. Not a lot we haven&#x27;t seen before.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I personally was hoping for a sequel. There is so much
more to Greek mythology they just had to take the opportunity. It may
not be one of the best of it&#x27;s kind, but &#x27;Wrath&#x27; is solid entertainment
for fans of Fantasy and Adventure.<br /><br />My rating: 3.5/5
