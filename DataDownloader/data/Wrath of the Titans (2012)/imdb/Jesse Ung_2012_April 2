In 2010, we were given the monstrosity that was CLASH OF THE TITANS.
While there probably was a handful of people who liked it, the people
who didn&#x27;t, wrote it off as just terrible. It&#x27;s story was incoherent,
it&#x27;s acting was average and the 3D was pointless and poorly executed.
The film, in my opinion wasn&#x27;t bad, but had too much potential
squandered in it&#x27;s 90 minute run-time. So, what about it&#x27;s sequel WRATH
OF THE TITANS?<br /><br />I am pleased to say that WRATH is a better and welcome improvement.
It&#x27;s no great film I assure you. Still suffering from a problematic
script, characters and plot, but it doesn&#x27;t distract too much from the
film overall. Some of the characters are present to provide comic
relief, but most of the humor doesn&#x27;t quite work or feels out of place.
For the most part, Sam Worthington played his role pretty well. It&#x27;s
nothing great, but considering what he had to work with, he did pretty
okay. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were also rather enjoyable to
watch. Unfortunately, all the other characters don&#x27;t really seem to
work, or have anything to do. A great example is poor Rosamund Pike,
she had a great character and an awesome actress behind her, but as
with Noomi Rapace in Sherlock Holmes 2, she simply had nothing to do,
and honestly, not much reason for her to be there. There is also a very
pointless romance near the end that I won&#x27;t detail too much.<br /><br />But most importantly, the 3D was a vast improvement over the first.
It&#x27;s no AVATAR for sure, but it does a very good job of showcasing it&#x27;s
action scenes and brilliant special effects, especially in the climax
with Kronos. It does depth very well and is spectacular considering it
was post-converted to 3D. <br /><br />In the end, flaws aside, I came out enjoying WRATH OF THE TITANS. It&#x27;s
still quite problematic, but like Transformers and Mission Impossible,
it&#x27;s a decent way to spend 99 3D minutes of pure entertainment.<br /><br />NOTE: For precaution, if you think you may not like the film, see it in
3D, at least you will have enjoyed something.
