The movie has mediocre actor&#x27;s performance, Slow and boring, mediocre
Costume Design, I felt like I was watching an old Jesus Christ movie.
Is incredible how the movie industry release such a bad quality
product. I was insulted paying $35 per couple to see this. It not worth
it!. The way they put the story is a simple fight between two brothers,
I prefer to watch days of our lives than this movie. The Story does not
have consistency and continuity, also the vocabulary used in the
scripts is not congruent or match with the age you are trying to evoke.
In conclusion, poor dialog quality, the best performance was Liam
Neeson ans still it wasn&#x27;t his best, the gay from avatar out of
context, not worth a comment, because was really BAD!!!!!!
