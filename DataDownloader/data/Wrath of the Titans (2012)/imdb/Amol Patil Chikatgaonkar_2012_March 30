After seen &#x22;THE HUNGER GAMES&#x22; i was Very Much Disappointed. i didn&#x27;t
Having Any Expectations for this Movie. But I enjoyed a Lot.this movie.
Brilliant Movie.Visual Effects r Outstanding specially in 3D. Director
Jonathan Liebesman did commendable job.i haven&#x27;t seen any movie of
him.but his direction is awesome.Movie&#x27;s Length also not very much just
1 hour 40 Minutes. When Zeus n Hades Come Together to Save World that
scene is my Favourite in the movie. Sam Worthington,Liam Neeson,Ralph
Fiennes,Rosamund Pike delivered Good Performances. But the Real Hero of
the Movie is &#x22;Edgar Ramirez as Ares&#x22; n &#x22;Toby Kebbell as Agenor&#x22; This
Both r Outstanding in d Movie. FInal Words My Rating for Wrath of the
Titans is 10 out 10. Spectacular Action Sequel That Surpasses the
Original. n Much Much Better Than &#x22;THE HUNGER GAMES&#x22; If u wanna Enjoy
this Movie u Must Watch in 3D. Strongly Recommended Don&#x27;t Miss.
