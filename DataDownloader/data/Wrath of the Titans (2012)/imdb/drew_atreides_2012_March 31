I enjoyed this one in a Saturday Matin&#xE9;e-sorta way..<br /><br />The set-pieces are epic, the creatures imaginative, and the FX pretty
spectacular.<br /><br />The acting is a bit wooden, especially from Sam Worthington whose
entire performance seems to be rasping breathlessly and bleeding a lot,
but the supporting cast pick up the slack (especially the always
reliable Bill Nighy.)<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t recommend seeing it in 3D, although i do have to admit there
were 2 or 3 shots that were actually pretty effective. <br /><br />Still, not gonna miss much if you go for the 2D.<br /><br />I enjoyed the original Clash, as well as the remake. This one will find
it&#x27;s way onto my DVD/BLU-RAY shelf as well.
