This film is so bad, it is at least 10 times worse than the first one<br /><br />i hoped this film would be fantastic because the trailer was amazing,
however the film is a mess, the actors are rubbish, the script is
useless, the directing is a shambles.<br /><br />A very boring film<br /><br />To see that 1340 people have given this 10/10 , 42% of people.<br /><br />This shows there is something very wrong, this film is at best 3/10,
but realistically it is 1/10 you have to have no intelligence to watch
this drizzle, maybe if you are 5 years old you might like it<br /><br />Avoid at all costs, the movie is nothing like the great trailer!!!
