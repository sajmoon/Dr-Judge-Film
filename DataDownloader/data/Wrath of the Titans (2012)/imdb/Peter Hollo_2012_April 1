There was no problem with the remake. Hell, after seeing the CGI Medusa
and the Kraken I wouldn&#x27;t watch the original. Changes were made here
and there but overall the film was OK.<br /><br />There comes the sequel. More monsters, more CGI, more battles, and more
Liam Neeson / Ralph Fiennes. More acting? No, scratch that out. New
plot? Well, some places and names were borrowed from Greek mythology
but this is the most the film can offer.<br /><br />The bad guy this time is Cronus who appears to be a giant lava golem
capable of unleashing a lot of creatures to punish mankind. I wonder
why it is necessary, after all, it&#x27;s all about the gods arguing with
each other as to which part of the world to rule. <br /><br />Perseus, now a father, is once again contacted by Zeus who warns him of
the coming danger. We already know he&#x27;ll reject but he&#x27;ll be involved,
eventually. It&#x27;s a shame to see how these wonderful actors depend on
money - why else would they have accepted their roles? Neeson, Fiennes
and Worthington are joined by Danny Huston, Rosamund Pike and Bill
Nighy. Shame, shame, shame. Avoid it if you can - stick to the original
or to the remake (but consider the latter a casual one, too).
