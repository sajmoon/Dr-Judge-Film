2012_April 3 
This is one of the rare occasions where the sequel is far better than
the original. And guess what? THE 3D ACTUALLY WORKS!!! Again I had my
doubts because the first film was dreadfully poor, but Wrath of the
Titans delivers and puts its predecessor in the shade. Most of the
original cast return and Sam Worthington does even better this time
round than his last outing as demi god Perseus. Liam Neeson again does
no wrong in my book and continues to deliver another solid performance
as Zeus, likewise with Ralph Fiennes. I thought Hades was the highlight
of the first film and here Fiennes continues where he left off. Also
support from Rosmund Pike, Esteban Ramirez and Toby Kebbell is most
welcome. They too put good performances and contributed immensely to my
enjoyment of the film. I really had a good time with this. This is the
second Johnathan Liebesman film I&#x27;ve had a great time watching, the
first being Battlefield: Earth. Liebesman&#x27;s film is action packed and
special effects laden feast of fun. He does a good job of focusing on
the story as well as filming great action sequences and because of this
the film doesn&#x27;t drag one bit. From start to finish, from the off the
adventure starts and doesn&#x27;t stop until, well the end. The fight scenes
against the giant Cyclopes and the labyrinth Minotaur are standouts, as
is the finale. The only problems I had with Wrath as the Titans was the
dialogue wasn&#x27;t great and Bill Nighy, who makes a cameo playing
Hephaetus the weapon forger of the Gods, was terrible comic relief. He
totally ruined the dark tone I thought the film was trying to create.
He puts on a northern accent and sounds rather like Frank Gallagher
from Shameless, just without the cigarettes and six pack of Stella
Artois.<br /><br />All in all, Wrath of the Titans removes any memory of the hideous first
film. Great action, muscular set pieces and good performances. Is this
worth a trip to your local movie house and a Blu-ray purchase?<br /><br />Yes it is!
