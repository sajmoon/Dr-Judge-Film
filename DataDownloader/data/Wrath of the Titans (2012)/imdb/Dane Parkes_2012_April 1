2012_April 1 
I have read the reviews on here and I am convinced people are reviewing
this film without actually seeing it. I think people are still angry
about the post 3D conversion of the first film and are looking for ways
to recreate that drama on blogs. This film is not meant to be an Oscar
contender, it is merely an action packed entertaining popcorn flick and
on that front it delivers hard and fast.<br /><br />The plot is basic, Zeus (Liam Neeson) is imprisoned by his brother
Hades (Ralph Fiennes)and the only one who can save him is his son
Perseus (Sam Worthington). But I don&#x27;t want to use this review to write
the plot which is available everywhere. What I do want to do is let
people know that this film is far superior to it&#x27;s 2010 original.<br /><br />The action and special effects scenes are fantastic and they are what
really elevate this film from other sword and sandal movies. The scenes
with Kronos are possible some of the best special effects I have seen
in an action/adventure movie and I found myself having a few WOW
moments, something that I rarely do.<br /><br />I saw this film in 3D and it is beautifully rendered, I honestly think
those complaining about the 3D have not seen it in 3D because the
conversion is flawless, the depth is great and really stands out during
some of the major action sequences.<br /><br />One let down was the acting, Sam Worthington doe&#x27;s not seem remotely
worried during the entire movie, even during scenes when his son could
be in danger he has the same expression on his face, during a scene
when he tells his son he loves him the line is delivered so badly that
people in the theater laughed which took away from the tender moment it
was supposed to be.<br /><br />All in all we had a great time though and really enjoyed the film for
what is was, an over the top special effects driven adventure movie,
and on that alone I would highly recommend it to others
