I can not think about any good reason to go to see this movie in a
theater. The story is really poor and the characters are ridiculous and
too simple, and the acting is very weak, specially Tobby Kebbell. The
film doesn&#x27;t put you into the action and you are one hundred minutes
wondering what you will do the next weekend. The mythology is terribly
documented and there are a lot of incredible mistakes. Okay, there are
some cool action scenes and incredible monsters and creatures, that&#x27;s
why I put a 4 instead of a 1.<br /><br />I saw Clash of the titans and I&#x27;ve seen Wrath of the titans. If there
is a third one, I&#x27;m sure I will not repeat my mistake. Really, it&#x27;s not
worth watching.
