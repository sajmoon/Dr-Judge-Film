Hard to believe that two years ago we were watching Sam Worthington
Playing the role of Perseus and attempting to stop the gods&#x27; tyranny
over the human world in Clash of the Titans. That movie was mediocre at
best, but had some decent mythological adventure that got many people
back into the Greek culture. So when I saw a sequel coming out I
thought, &#x22;Hey Wrath of the Titans looks like it will make up for what
its predecessor lacked.&#x22; Today I gave Wrath of the Titans a try and
well it&#x27;s pretty much like the first one with a few improvements. Read
on to find out more about this sequel.<br /><br />The premise of this story is quite ironic to me, as instead of trying
to destroy the Gods Perseus is instead trying to help them from
obliteration. A lack of praying by the humans has left the Gods weak
and as a result their imprisonment of the Titan Kronos is slowly
fading. Perseus is thus charged with the task of finding a way to stop
this from happening, even if it means venturing to the underworld
itself. <br /><br />I know the quest sounds promising and combined with the trailers, I was
thinking this adventure was going to be full of fast paced action that
the other one lacked. The good news is the directors managed to improve
a bit of the action, a few of the scenes through the quest were
actually well planned, coordinated, and full of Greek against monster
action. I&#x27;m happy to say that the ending battles delivered the action I
was looking for, with many of the human vs. Titan minions mimicking
Lord of The Rings style action. Most of the scenes were even well
captured, the camera work for once not being too jumpy to avoid showing
off the detailed battle. Unfortunately, the planners decided to once
again insert a massacre scene where a good portion of the party gets
whacked in a matter of seconds; though I will say this scene was much
better than the Medusa hunting scene in the previous movie. <br /><br />Now I&#x27;ve mentioned a lot of monsters, creatures, and fighting scenes so
far in this review and you may be asking, &#x22;Hey Robbie, how was the CGI
surrounding the action?&#x22; The answer to that question is pretty good, as
the designing team managed to make the various Greek monsters come to
life in terrifying ways. Environments and battlefields were well
detailed from the gritty dusty plains, to the dark filled caves of the
underworld, and were not the polished, clean, artificial worlds that
we&#x27;ve seen in countless Star Wars films. The editing with the CGI was
also well done and flowed smoothly with little if any choppy animated
movements, with the extras also interacting well with the artificial
environment. Perhaps it&#x27;s here I will mention that the musical score
was excellent. Every scene in this movie had the right touch of music
to help spur the emotion and pull you further into the scene. Albeit it
sounds like all the other orchestra works in countless movies, I was
still impressed by how well the score and scenes went together. <br /><br />As for characters/acting purposes, well there really isn&#x27;t that much of
a change from the prequel. Worthington plays the exact same role as the
first film, and essentially performs the same way he did two years ago,
with the exception of he has more action this time. Liam Neeson still
knows how to play Zeus, and has that same monotone, deep, smooth voiced
delivery of his lines that has made him famous in countless movies. The
leading lady for this movie is not Io, but instead Queen Andromeda
(Rosamund Pike) who has a little more fight to her despite the fact
that most of the emotion and lines are delivered in the same manner.
However, I think the best characters for me in this movie were Agenor
(Toby Kebbell) and Hephaestus (Bill Nighy). Both of these characters
brought comedic relief to the movie, yet still had other qualities
about them that separated them from the typical fool sidekick. Kebbell
is kind of like the Russell Brand in this movie, except not drunk,
while Nighy had more of the eccentric and crazy humor at his disposal.
I do admit there were a few times in his dialog where he brought back
his Davy Jones accent, which had me laughing. Other than the rest of
the cast was fine, but nothing to really brag about other than maybe
Ralph Fiennes who showed off his ability to be dark, gloomy, and
cunning, and this time without the cheesy scream.<br /><br />Overall Wrath of the Titans was an improvement over its predecessor,
but it&#x27;s still nothing to brag about. While the action was better, it
still didn&#x27;t live up to what I had gotten from the trailer, at least
not until the end. The simple plot was also very predictable and
linear, with not too many surprises happening along the way. I also
felt that the trailer had set up a lot of other mythological legends,
but when it came time to deliver them well they weren&#x27;t that exciting
to experience. So my scores for this movie are the following:<br /><br />Action/Adventure: 7.0 -7.5 Movie overall: 6.5<br /><br />I would say this movie is worth a Netflix or rent, and definitely not
worth a 3-D ticket price. However, I would say that fans of Greek
mythology will probably not be disappointed with the latest Titans
installment. Check back soon for my review on Mirror Mirror and as
always keep enjoying the movies.
