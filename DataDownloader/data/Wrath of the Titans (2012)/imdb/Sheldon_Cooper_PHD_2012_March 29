That was really fun! <br /><br />COTT was really bad and disappointing. In WOTT, Worthington is much
better (I love the guy, but he was bland in COTT, and he says so
himself, very professional guy), pretty intense, loved the scenes with
his son Helius, nice moments with Zeus as well, he gets his ass kicked
and kicks some major ass.<br /><br />Neeson is great, Fiennes is really at ease, Kebbell is good, Nighy
great as usual, Ramirez great (even though critics don&#x27;t seem to think
the same thing).<br /><br />Incredible CGI, really, Kronos, Chimera, Tartarus, great set pieces,
great monsters, beautifully shot, Liebesman really has an eye for the
visuals, sometimes hand-held and shaky cam is used, and it works well.
The action was for me most of the time mind-blowing, especially the
last third of the movie. <br /><br />Story is much better, even though dialogues are weak, it&#x27;s more light-
hearted. The 3D (and I&#x27;m pretty much a 3D lover) is great, lots of pop
out, great depth, works really well with the scenery, creatures, action
scenes. There are some really bad-ass scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br />All in all, a truly bad-ass, kick-ass, fun movie that will get
destroyed by the critics who seem like they can&#x27;t just enjoy a
blockbuster for what it is.
