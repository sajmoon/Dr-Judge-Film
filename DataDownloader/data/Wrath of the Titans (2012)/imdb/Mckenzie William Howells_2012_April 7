Slaughters the beauty of tales that have been told for millennia in a
purely desperate act for box-office success. Disappointment. Consider
this a success if you look for action, because that is all you get;
there is poor dialogue, a story line (that could have made this a
classic) that is told cumulatively within 5 minutes and acting as if it
were a love story - You&#x27;re Demi-Gods, not some lads on holiday looking
to beat the thief that stole your dads&#x27; wallets (Toby Kebbell) ! <br /><br />Cerberus (guardian of Tartarus) was not even to be seen, even though
the unraveling of events took place on his porch! Kronos, the much
feared and anticipated Titan who was frequently mentioned baring dread
throughout the film, only lasted 5 minutes while free!<br /><br />This film is a disaster; it controls a masterpiece, and amazingly
ripped it to shreds - somehow. Was Jonathan Liebesman trying to sculpt
his reputation in the form of Kronos? It&#x27;s certainly as dead as him
after this one. Liebesman could have made a classic; the storyline
would have held with a great degree of entertainment for 2:30hrs at
least, which would have explained the history of the tales in the film
and the purpose of the evil perspective as well as the good, but
instead quick action was preferred, or was this because of the
incapabilities of Sam Worthington to perform like an actual actor,
rather than a hero who knows he&#x27;s a hero but doesn&#x27;t live like a hero
(idiotic I know) every minute of the film. I mean, where is the
substance?!!!<br /><br />Please do not complete a trilogy, I think some of Greece&#x27;s ancient
tales still live, don&#x27;t murder them too.<br /><br />M.W.Howells.
