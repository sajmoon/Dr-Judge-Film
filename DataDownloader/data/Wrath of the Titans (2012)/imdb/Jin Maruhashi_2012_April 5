Heroically extolled for confronting an army of horripilating and
lavishly overpowered brutes, Perseus (Sam Worthington) in &#x22;Wrath of the
Titans&#x22; still wavers in vanquishing his prime nemesis: his inflexibly
cemented facial expression of monochromatic anger lingering in nearly
all scenes. Although emotionally limited, the film compensates through
countless, visually ornate clashes involving a gargantuan lava-spraying
monstrosity, a drool-exuding minotaur, a multi-headed fire-breathing
beast as well as other more humanly opponents that still impress with
their ridiculously potent tridents. The 3D feature of the film is well
employed and exploited by showcasing the aforementioned community of
garishly astounding characters under this more emphatic perspective. A
stable camera-work also ensures that viewers are able to satisfactorily
discern the action that takes place without the irksome turbulence that
dazes and obfuscates the on-screen happenings in many films. Overall,
this stability positively highlights the legion of 3D behemoths but it
seems that the protagonist has taken the title too personally by
showing us his one-expression-fits-all acting...again.
