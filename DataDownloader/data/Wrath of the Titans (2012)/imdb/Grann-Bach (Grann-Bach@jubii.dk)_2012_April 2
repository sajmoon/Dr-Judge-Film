Io has died off-screen, having fulfilled her role as the love interest
for the first(and departing right after, as per the rules for the
genre), leaving room for a romance(? right? I mean, it isn&#x27;t actually
present for most of this, if it is obvious that it will be there)
between Andromeda(yup, that was why she wasn&#x27;t the one in the first, so
she&#x27;d be free to be it in this one) and Perseus, who is also left with
a wimpy-looking(when doesn&#x27;t he look scared?) son, Helius(there for
emotional stakes and nothing else... early on, Mr. P dreams that they
will both die, thus making this sequel that people are already
wondering if they want to be watching a partial rip-off of Matrix
Reloaded, one of the biggest follow-up letdowns in history... bad
call). Humans are still not believing in the gods, and with them losing
their power, Zeus is captured(his powers being drained, in order to
help free Cronos), so our hero has to travel to and through the maze of
Tartarus with female lead and Agenor(fellow halfdeity, son of Poseidon,
starts out with personality(an obnoxious one, you think he might be the
comic relief), soon after loses it, presumably to fit in with everyone
else, since no one but Hades, his royal brother and the offspring of
last-mentioned, Ares, have anything interesting in the way of
character... actually, those three have good drama between them)), on a
rescue mission. This is a thoroughly enjoyable mindless popcorn flick,
well aware of what it is. There is some humor from a little of the
dialog(when it isn&#x27;t average and forgettable) and the role Hephaestus,
played by a crazy Bill Nighy(so, nothing new there), who, as a hermit,
has lost it completely. But what really works is the action, with
several badass supernatural creatures, including cyclops&#x27;, this
two-headed firebreathing wolfthing, twin-torso swordwielding humanoid
ones and this massive one made from lava. Heck, even the
Olympus-dwellers get into it, and they are clearly far more powerful
than the men. With only one exception, they are all established, built
up and get as much screen-time and awesome combat as they should. This
is paced remarkably well, it&#x27;s never boring nor does it overwhelm you.
The 3D is excellent, used in the right moments, when it wants to be
epic. There is violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this
to anyone looking for brainless fun. 7/10
