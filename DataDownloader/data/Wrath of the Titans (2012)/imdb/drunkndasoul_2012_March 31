K i&#x27;d like to start off by questioning, why is there so much bashing
going on to Clash of the Titans remake?? yes , there was disappointing
in which they should not have changed from the original. BUT it does
not make it a bad movie or the fact that the first one had plenty of
action and if you ask me a bit of the same dialog as the sequel.Also ,
i thought the Medusa scene and Kraken scene was amazing in that
film.(thats my opinion though) With that said i thought the remake if
you look at it as its own movie , was not that bad and completely
underrated. <br /><br />Alright, with that said, the sequel is a def. B+ movie. It has a ton of
action in it and yes the plot was not really that focused on as much as
it should have been. Do i think the action was senseless? No, majority
of the films action was necessary and went with it. (its Greek
mythology people-there is tons of key and action points in it) A lot of
the CGI was awesome, Chronos looked awesome as well and so did
everything else. The story did go off a bit, but it did stay on course
of what they were trying to do. I think the only problem i had was
Aries and another part but i don&#x27;t want to spoil. I think Aries was to
light and not enough bad ass for me.<br /><br />All in all i&#x27;m not gonna sit here and use a lot of words that people
will no understand anyways and try to look like a critic but for those
that want a straight answer and rely on reviews as whether to see a
movie. I&#x27;d say go see this movie, it is very action packed and good
Greek mythology mixture.
