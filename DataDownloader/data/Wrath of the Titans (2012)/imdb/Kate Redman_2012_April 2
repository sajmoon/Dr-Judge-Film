First the good... The special effects are very good &#x26; the 3D was well
done. It didn&#x27;t seem like an afterthought (like so many other movies) &#x26;
I genuinely flinched in places.<br /><br />Now the bad... In Irish Zeus, an Australian Perseus, a Spanish Ares, a
VERY posh English Andromeda, a broad Yorkshire Hephaestus &#x26; a
country-bumpkin Agenor (sun of Poseidon)<br /><br />It was a Godawfull mix of accents that really didn&#x27;t gel &#x26; were an
affront to my ears. OK, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting everybody to be speaking
with Greek accents but I would have expected some kind of consistency
through the characters. This mishmash of accents detracted somewhat
from the film... that &#x26; Sam Worthington&#x27;s monotone &#x26; somewhat stilted
performance.<br /><br />Overall it was an OK film, but I won&#x27;t be bothering to get the DVD to
watch it again.
