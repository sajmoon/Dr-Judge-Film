Once bitten, twice shy. I suppose the really bad 3D effects in the
Clash of the Titans remake two years ago made me steer really clear of
yet another post-production 3D conversion effort in this follow up
sequel, and going by the looks of it, there isn&#x27;t really much to
provide that depth of field, nor effort in the way it&#x27;s shot to exploit
the 3D format, other than to rake in extra dollars since the 2010
version did so to have green lit this total imaginary Greek mythology
scribed by Greg Berlanti, David Johnson and Dan Mazeau, who between
them have written stuff like Green Lantern, Orphan, and Red Riding
Hood. But one thing&#x27;s for sure, gone is the direction and focus on pure
action, and in comes a semblance of a stronger storyline.<br /><br />The theme about fathers and sons cannot be more pronounced in Wrath of
the Titans, set 10 years after the first film, that harks back to the
Greek mythology origins of the splitting of powers between Zeus (Liam
Neeson), Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston) when they
condemn their father Cronos into the depths of Hell, and Zeus having to
play Hades out by making the latter lord of the underworld. So the
balance of power has remained as such, until Zeus walks into a trap as
planned by Hades and Zeus&#x27; son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) the god of War
because of his jealousy of Perseus (Sam Worthington), the new favoured
son of Zeus. With Zeus entrapped to sap his life force and powers for
Cronos, the plan is to release Cronos back into the world to destroy
everything in the known universe.<br /><br />The saviour is of course demi god Perseus, who now is a father to
Helius (John Bell), his son with now deceased wife Io, conveniently
written out because of Gemma Arterton&#x27;s non participation, and to steer
the romance in this fable back to between Perseus and Queen Andromeda,
who&#x27;s now Warrior Queen and played by Rosamund PIke. And Perseus can&#x27;t
save the world alone because he&#x27;s only a half-god up against the might
of Ares, Hades and Cronos, so he has to team up with another demi god,
the son of Poseidon, Agenor (Toby Kebbell), who will lead them to
Hephaestus (Bill Nighy), who holds the key to safe passage to the
Underworld where Zeus is imprisoned. The quest this time, as you can
see, is kept quite linear and straightforward, which makes it extremely
easy to follow as the dots get connected in the most simplest of
fashion, keeping in constant reminder of the theme that deals with the
squabbles between family members, and fights between envious siblings.<br /><br />And not only is the story kept simple, the battle scenes here were also
cleanly designed without complication, unleashing new beasts yet to be
seen in the Clash of the Titans film, involving ugly two-headed hounds
from hell, battles with one eyed cyclops, and of course, big daddy
himself who seemed more smoke and mirrors, especially since the
strategy involves something that&#x27;s very close to Star Wars&#x27; destruction
of the Death Star. I can&#x27;t fathom why there are so many complaints
about the big minotaur fight unless you&#x27;re watching the film really
close to the screen. Some easter eggs continue from the first film,
such as the presence of mechanical owl Bubo, and Pegasus having a
little bit more personality though still sidelined as being nothing
more than air transportation.<br /><br />Sam Worthington looked like he&#x27;s enjoying much of the adventures of
Perseus this time round, playing the man who walked away from his new
found fame as the Kraken slayer, to return once again from his life of
being a simple fisherman, and taking up arms and fight to save the
world against the titans in the film (collectively inclusive of the
other monsters in the film). With the gods severely weakened because
nobody prays to them, the role of Perseus and Agenor, for slight comic
relief, may pave the door to follow up films that deal more with demi
gods than those residing in Mount Olympus. Liam Neeson and Ralph
Fiennes had a lot more to do here also in expanded roles, with the
final act providing the opportunity for one last hurrah that is
surprisingly moving.<br /><br />Perhaps the miscast here would be Rosamund Pike&#x27;s Andromeda, with the
idea of a Warrior Queen being a departure from Andromeda&#x27;s usual role
of the damsel in distress, but this film still being more testosterone
suited instead. She doesn&#x27;t get to do much given her very human
abilities, and is there as token romantic interest with a romance that
isn&#x27;t strong to begin with, coupled with a sagging mid-section that
involves hallucination en route to the Underworld that got abandoned
before it even begun for her character. Her troopers too in the final
battle scene didn&#x27;t get to do much despite much posturing for nothing,
and were relegated to mere cheer leaders for the most part, grateful
that someone else had stepped up to the plate and did their fighting
for them instead.<br /><br />Still, if compared to the rather disastrous Clash of the Titans 2 years
ago, Wrath of the Titans is a leg up in terms of storytelling, and
didn&#x27;t have an albatross of the superbly nostalgic 1981 version hanging
around its neck to be compared to. The fights also didn&#x27;t get obsessed
with wanting to be bigger, faster and more CG-laden, and the
combination of a more focused plot and theme, with better designed
battles that adhered to the mantra of keeping it simple, proved to be a
winner for this follow up. Recommended for being that far out,
imaginary modern take on Greek mythology that played on the what-if
scenario.
