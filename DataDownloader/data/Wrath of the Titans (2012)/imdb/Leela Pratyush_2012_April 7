Nice movie with awesome action and graphics.But if some one is keen
interested in story and good narration of story, then this is not the
movie for those. There is no comedy, not a very good plot.But I went
for this movie just for the good action and good graphics. I am more
than satisfied with what is presented. Also 3D effects are very good in
this movie. I like LOR and Matrix series very much and I like this
series too unlike Harry Potter ,Twilight,Narnia and Transformers where
only one or two parts are good and all remaining are very boring. I am
waiting for Avengers eagerly.Also just to mention Hunger games movie
was also good. :)
