Thinking of going to see Wrath of the Titans? In 3d? Save yourself some
pocket money and do the following instead: lie on the ground and pour a
mixture of soil and skittles slowly into your eyes whilst mumbling the
names of Greek Gods. This will have the same entertainment value as the
film, and a considerably better plot.<br /><br />Having seen the remake of the original, I went into Wrath of the Titans
with my expectation level pretty low. Five minutes in, I quickly
lowered it further. Ten minutes in... I buried my expectation level
under my seat and stomped it into the ground - hard. But however low I
set the bar, the film went lower. It&#x27;s unimaginably dire.<br /><br />There&#x27;s simply nothing redeemable about the film at all. Even the
impressive effects are ruined by awful direction that renders them no
more engaging than watching a ten year old playing video games through
a kaleidoscope.<br /><br />Everyone involved in making Wrath of the Titans should be thoroughly
ashamed of themselves; and to be fair Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes
clearly are as they show it on screen. They both look embarrassed to be
a part of it. I&#x27;m embarrassed that I bore witness to it. Please don&#x27;t
be a statistic and join us. There&#x27;s nothing to see here - move along,
move along.
