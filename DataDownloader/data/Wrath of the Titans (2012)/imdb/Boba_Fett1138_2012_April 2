2012_April 2 
It&#x27;s normal for sequels to be inferior to its predecessors but I must
say that the last couple of years sequels are only getting better and
better and every so often also pass the original.<br /><br />That&#x27;s also the case with &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22;, that is a sequel to
the 2010 movie &#x22;Clash of the Titans&#x22;. &#x22;Clash of the Titans&#x22; had all
sorts of problems in it and while &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22; is far from a
flawless movie, it still is an improvement over the first movie.<br /><br />This movie was at least more focused with its story, which made it a
more pleasant movie to follow. It&#x27;s still not like I has a solid story
in it and I didn&#x27;t even really always knew what was going on exactly in
it but it at least flows well and helps to make this movie a fun and
mindless, action packed, blockbuster. <br /><br />It has a bigger budget than its predecessor but yet it doesn&#x27;t look
bigger or more expensive, which is only a positive thing to say really.
It means that this movie has less tendencies to show off with some big
action set pieces or CGI created creatures. Everything that happens in
this movie fits better into its story and more often than not, serves a
purpose within it as well. Besides, it looks as if this movie spend
more of its budget on its set designs and other visual aspects, beside
its special effects.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it remains still obvious that the foremost reason as to
why this movie was such an expensive one to make was due to its special
effects. But it all paid off! The special effects for the movie are
simply great and help to make this movie often a spectacular and
entertaining one.<br /><br />It also still would had been so much better if it actually was a more
involving movie to watch. It never gets you a true sense of excitement
or tension because you don&#x27;t ever feel involved enough with any of its
events or characters.<br /><br />I like that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes get to do a bit more in this
movie at times and don&#x27;t just show up randomly every now and then, like
still was the case with the first movie. They serve a more important
purpose but still their roles aren&#x27;t much bigger really. It&#x27;s still
somewhat disappointing seeing Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in this and
the movie doing far too little with those two. Especially when you have
an actor such as Ralph Fiennes playing a villainous role, you should
definitely exploit this as a movie and do something more and better
with it.<br /><br />The movie besides Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Sam Worthington,
features mostly new characters and actors in it. And some of the actors
and characters are a true welcome addition. Rosamund Pike and Bill
Nighy are being the most notable ones.<br /><br />Really, it&#x27;s not a bad movie or one that I hated watching. I still
can&#x27;t rate it very highly, simply because it&#x27;s just nothing too great
or involving to watch either. Anyway, chances are you will probably
still end up liking it more than not.<br /><br />6/10 <br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
