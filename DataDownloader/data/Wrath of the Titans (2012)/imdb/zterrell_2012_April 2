For characterization this should get 0 stars. For camera work, it
should get dumped in the trash can. For action and fight scenes... from
what the normal eye can see, it is endless battles that are mostly
wasted celluloid because the camera never stops to focus on the action.
I think we should take all of the idiots, who thought a shaky camera
was somehow an improvement of 80 years of excellent work by film
directors, and draft them into becoming mine sweepers for our
troops...using real brooms!<br /><br />I dragged my wife to this saying it couldn&#x27;t be as bad as it sounded,
because we actually enjoyed the first Clash of the Titans. Now she
won&#x27;t trust me to pick our next movie. In a word the film was boring.
The writer must have thought Sam Worthington was John Wayne and this
was his last picture, so everyone would love him without any reason
whatsoever. He has a son...except there is no real bonding. Oh, and he
and the Queen...well, it&#x27;s understood they are an item. No need for
romance or bonding there. And the show makes a statement about fathers
and sons...but not one that makes much sense. <br /><br />So if you love mindless actions with closeup unwatchable action, with
lots of explosions and an occasional glimpse of a creature, this is for
you.<br /><br />Finally, the cyclops were quite well done, but not worth the price of
admission.
