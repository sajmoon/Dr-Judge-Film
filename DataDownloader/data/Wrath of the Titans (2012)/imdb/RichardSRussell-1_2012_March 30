Wrath of the Titans (1:39, PG-13, 3-D) &#x97; 5 &#x97; fantasy: sword &#x26; sorcery,
biggie, sequel<br /><br />Here, in response to no obvious demand, we have Sequel of the Titans.
What follows is less a coherent review than a collection of
observations.<br /><br />(1) The plural is misleading. There&#x27;s only 1 titan, Cronos, and he&#x27;s
off-screen for 90% of the film. He&#x27;s been imprisoned in Tartarus for
eons, which explains why he&#x27;s wrathful. What is never satisfactorily
explained (or even addressed) was how this mountain-sized lava monster
ever procreated, since he&#x27;s supposed to be the father of much smaller
and more human-like gods like feuding brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and
Hades.<br /><br />(2) Don&#x27;t go in with any pre-conceived ideas based on actual Greek
mythology. It&#x27;s a 2011 story featuring characters left over from 2010&#x27;s
Clash of the Titans.<br /><br />(3) Warner Bros. threw a lot of money at this, and most of it shows up
on the screen.<br /><br />(4) It&#x27;s pretty much non-stop fighting (vs. chimeras, cyclopes, a
minotaur, and assorted gods and demigods), not entirely at the frenetic
pace of Transformers, where things are flying by too fast to figure out
who&#x27;s doing what to whom, but too much so for my taste.<br /><br />(5) The story is not going to win any Pulitzers, Nobels, or Hugos, but
it&#x27;s not entirely predictable, and anything that contemplates the total
extinction of the gods gets a big plus from me.<br /><br />(6) Despite having some pretty good actors in here (Liam Neeson, Ralph
Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, and, yes, Sam Worthington), they
don&#x27;t really get much chance to practice their craft, but they&#x27;re not
just phoning it in, either.<br /><br />(7) Based on the damage he absorbed, Perseus should have been dead or
permanently crippled on over a dozen occasions. Absence of credible
consequences makes it difficult to establish serious threats or build
suspense.<br /><br />(8) Psychologists who are fixated on the idea of daddy complexes will
love this. Normal people will spend a lot of time rolling their eyes.<br /><br />(9) Rosamund Pike is along for the ride as Queen Andromeda, and she
gets in a few licks, but mainly she cleans up real good.<br /><br />(10) I&#x27;m fonder of 3-D than most, so FWIW I thot it was put to good use
here in the swooping shots thru the burning villages, labyrinth, and
pits of hell. Mercifully, no pokey-outy sharp things, but I had to duck
the occasional flaming boulder.<br /><br />(11) This will not tax your intellect, but it&#x27;s a well-paced,
semi-interesting, action-packed ludicrously unbelievable adventure.
They could have done worse, and so could you.
