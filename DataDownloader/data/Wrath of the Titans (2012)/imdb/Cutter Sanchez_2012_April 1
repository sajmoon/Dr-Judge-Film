&#x22;Gods don&#x27;t die.&#x22; They do now.&#x22; Wrath of Titans, the latest entry in
the jumble of CG dominated sword and sandal films that have spilled
from Hollywood over the past few years, is unsurprisingly littered with
prosaic colloquy throughout its 99-minute runtime. Sadly, these
uninspired exchanges represent some of the film&#x27;s stronger writing as
Wrath is dominated by dialogue consisting of characters simply yelling
each other&#x27;s names in various states of distress. &#x22;Perseus!&#x22;
&#x22;Andromeda!&#x22; &#x22;Helius!&#x22; &#x22;The Navigator!&#x22; I could have sworn I even heard
someone yell out my name. &#x22;Cutter! Go home and watch The Immortals on
Amazon Video. You&#x27;ll enjoy it more!&#x22; It&#x27;s a shame I did not listen.<br /><br />Wrath picks up where its predecessor Clash of Titans left off, with
Perseus (Sam Worthington), son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and slayer of the
Kraken, now living a quiet life as a village fisherman, father and
widower. He is reluctant to join the latest fight to save the world,
but is soon forced back into action when poppa Zeus is captured by his
sinister brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and hell beasts, presumably
Titans, are set free upon the Earth to reek havoc. So what is Hades&#x27;
end game? That is where the story takes a plunge toward the absurd,
even for this film. Hades, realizing the Gods are now facing extinction
due to man&#x27;s eroding worship, plots to kidnap Zeus and transfer his
power to their evil father Kronos, imprisoned in hell stone by Zeus and
Hades years earlier, in the hope that Kronos will, after freeing
himself and destroying the very beings that give the Gods their power,
be merciful and somehow help him secure his immortality. Uh&#x85;okay.<br /><br />Adventure films need not be entirely plausible or coherent to be
successful, but they must, in the immortal words of Maximus Decimus
Meridius, answer the question, &#x22;Are you entertained?&#x22; There were two
headed dog beasts, giant Cyclopes, spinning minotaur infantry and
enough thunder and fire to squat brimstone and yet my answer is
emphatically no. In fact, I prefer the messy, murky Clash of the Titans
to its latest offspring, which speaks volumes since I slept through
most of it. <br /><br />Cutter&#x27;s Advice: See it, but don&#x27;t expect much = C-
