The world is ravished and nearly dead.The evil Umbrella corporation,
still after Alice is attempting to domesticate the zombies,but they
need her in order to do so.Meanwhile,a convoy of survivors is
attempting to find a small square of land where they can find peace.
Alice meets up with the convoy and finds herself the reluctant hero of
it.&quot;Resident Evil:Extinction&quot; borrows heavily from &quot;Day of the
Dead&quot;,&quot;Mad Max 2&quot;,&quot;The Killing Birds&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;.The story doesn&#39;t
make sense,once again full of convolutions,boring clich&eacute;d characters
and confusing subplots.The acting is rarely good and the film is a
mess.Still it&#39;s a passable entertainment,if you are in the mood for
highly kinetic action flick with zombies.6 out of 10.
