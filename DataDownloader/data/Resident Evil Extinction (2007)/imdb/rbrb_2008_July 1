My summary title is thanks to professional reviewer Philip French and
appropriately sums up this flick and my account of it.The opening scene
shows the female lead nude in the bath and in the version of the movie
I watched on cable has her naked body &quot;bubbled out&quot; and when any actor
smoked a cigarette there was similar censorship; yet countless scenes
of bloody killing with heads and bodies blown to bits are left
untouched! This film is part of a series itself but basically the world
is infected with a virus, zombies walk the earth, our heroine has
supernatural powers,a few &quot;goodies&quot; are trying to survive in the
desert, there is a mad scientist who is part of an evil underworld etc
and whatever. Some clever special effects makes this &quot;nonsence&quot; more or
less watchable. 6/10.
