all i have to say is ... of course resident evil doesn&#39;t follow the
games. just as Paul w.s. Anderson stated in the special features in the
first movie, why make the movie like the game you can just go play the
game again if you want that. obviously i am a resident evil fan boy.
blah blah blah. the truth is its either to much gore or running zombies
or something stupid like that that people base there goofy low ratings
on.grow up we all have seen gore before. here is an idea instead of
looking for wats wrong with the movie look for wats different and
better. even i myself thought 3 would stink but i thought to myself wow
do i ever feel like one of those people that give low ratings and
heightened my expectations. but enough about how great i am. jk big
time =). the movie rocked. everything was done in perfect amounts
instead of things coming back again and again like herpies everything
was done in controlled amounts. like the crows for instance. just when
you thought dear god how can they keep going with this it was all over
in an amazing flash. and when you c tyrant at the end you think oh its
all over then blammo. trust me if you like zombie flicks this is the
best of the best.
