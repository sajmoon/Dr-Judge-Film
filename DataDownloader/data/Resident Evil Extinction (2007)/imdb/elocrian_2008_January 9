I&#39;ve seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this is only the second
I&#39;ve been so disgusted as to have to rant about it. In general, I can
overlook bad acting for a decent story and will give a lot of leeway
for low-budget movies... this was just ridiculous! I remember liking
the first RE and not hating the second one... what a freakin&#39;
letdown...<br /><br />**** Spoiler Alert **** Right off the bat, the first scene with the
psycho-family and the &quot;dogs&quot; is pointless; not to mention, poorly
written and shot - like most of the film.<br /><br />Then there is this tight-knit band of survivors and dude gets bitten
and hides it from everyone?!?!? Unbelievable, completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The plot is completely disconnected with the &quot;mysterious&quot; council of
suits and... just - this movie just plain sucks - I should have known
better and I want my money back - and for the love of God, can we just
ban Paul Anderson from the biz???? If you want to good zombie flick -
there are at least 100 better ones - pick any... if you want to see a
better movie, you&#39;d be hard pressed to find many worse.
