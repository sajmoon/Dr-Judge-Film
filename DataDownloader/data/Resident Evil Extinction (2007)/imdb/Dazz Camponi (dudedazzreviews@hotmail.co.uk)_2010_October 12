I&#x27;ve now watched Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse which were
both good movies in their own way. Resident Evil: Extinction, however,
is the odd one out in the series as this isn&#x27;t even remotely good.
Resident Evil heroine Alice, along with a group of survivors from
Raccoon City, attempt to travel across the desert wilderness to Alaska
to escape a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />The story lacks a lot of everything, I could even go so far to say that
there is no story at all as it is yet again pretty much the same as its
last two movies. It has nothing to do with the games whatsoever so
Resident Evil gamers will definitely find this movie disappointing.
There were one or two great action sequences which kept you awake such
as the fight in Las Vegas and the crows but otherwise it is yet again
to impress the younger audience. The last two had something to do with
the games but this one didn&#x27;t, it just threw references at you just to
remind you that the movie is Resident Evil such as Claire Redfield,
Albert Wesker and the Tyrant from the first Resident Evil game.<br /><br />The acting was above average except for Milla Jovovich who managed to
brighten up this dull and boring movie a little. Ali Larter who played
Claire Redfield was average as was the rest of the cast. There are so
many problems with this movie but one of the main problems is that you
couldn&#x27;t care for the characters at all, not even for Alice. Resident
Evil: Extinction has made a silly twist to the story of the movie
series and has an even sillier ending. The start of the movie was
surprisingly promising but in the end, disappointed. Everything about
the movie could have been improved, even the make-up and design for the
zombies but the worst case for this is the Tyrant near the end of the
movie, it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near scary or believable.<br /><br />Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
