2007_September 22 
I&#39;ve been expecting this movie for so long and I couldn&#39;t believe how
excited I was that it was finally the 21st. I was on my quest to
purchase the tickets online (to avoid lines at the cinema) when I saw
that the rating of this movie on some websites wasn&#39;t even 3. I
wondered what the hell was happening. I decided to still get the
tickets and watch it. The story is pretty much advanced now since the
state of the characters and the scenario has changed dramatically. The
plot has a strong base and continues to bring pretty good action
scenes. There are some scenes that were a little boring and sent my
mind somewhere else (which is something I&#39;m absolutely against of) but
to the writer&#39;s defense are justified because they were moving the
story forward, which is every scene&#39;s mission. A lot of people has been
disappointed, and I guess it relays on the fact that, because this one
is the third one, we expect something better than the first two, but
basically there&#39;s no much of the story than the writer delivered and
I&#39;m thankful for it. I enjoyed the movie very much, and although it&#39;s
not an Oscar-winning, I&#39;ll give it an 8. Enjoy!
