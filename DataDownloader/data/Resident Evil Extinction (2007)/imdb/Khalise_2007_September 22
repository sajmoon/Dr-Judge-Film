Firstly this movie is a Kick-Ass Sequel. The First one was good. The
Second Okay. But the third is a must see action/horror/thriller.
Everyone in my family (and I mean everyone) went to go see this movie
and whether they were horror-freaks or scaredy cats they all got at
least one good &quot;jump out of there seat moment&quot; from this. I believe
anyone who doesn&#39;t like this movie is just a person who doesn&#39;t know
good taste when they see it. I wish for everyone to go see this movie,
not just for the triller but the acting as well and I guarantee the
first 15 mins will have you running for cover but also wanting more.
And the ending. You&#39;d never expect it....!!!! ~Khalise P.
