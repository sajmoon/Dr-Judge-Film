as a fan of the 1st Resident Evil i was seriously disappointed by
Resident Evil: Extinction.<br /><br />The acting was cheesy and pretty bad. Milla Jovovich reminded me of her
character in the Fifth Element and Joan of Arc - which i really liked.
This movie was borderline dumb and stupid. it was dull and boring.
whoever did the make up on the zombies did a very poor job as they
looked like they wore cheesy 70s masks on their faces. the
cinematography was OK as it reminded of old western movies. Ashanti&#39;s
acting was awful, even Oded Fehr who is usually a good actor was dull
and cheesy. i couldn&#39;t understand the glossy look on Milla&#39;s face also.
it seems like they filtered out her wrinkles or imperfections. it
seemed they blurred out under eyes, around her mouth, cheeks, and
forehead - and in other shots you can see that her face looks a little
different with bags under her eyes. had it not been so obvious i
wouldn&#39;t keep wondering about it.<br /><br />it seemed like the movie was rushed into production because someone
felt they had something good, but instead it looked like a movie made
by a bunch of amateurs movie makers.<br /><br />the story was flat and boring as was the ending. this movie is for
anyone that has absolutely nothing else to watch or is completely
enamored with the actors.
