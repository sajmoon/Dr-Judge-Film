Alice along with a group of survivors attempt to travel to Alaska via
Las Vegas to escape a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not a player of the Resident Evil games, so all the films including
this 3rd instalment are non-bias. I&#x27;m not a fan of &#x27;super&#x27; zombie&#x27;s,
however, I enjoyed this one more than the second.<br /><br />It was good to see zombies in a desert wasteland setting but the film
has a cheap look to it in parts. Oded Fehr, Iain Glen and Mike Epps
return, Ali Larter is a welcomed new addition as Claire, but the rest
of the acting from the supporting cast isn&#x27;t too wonderful.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich (despite a odd hair-cut) once again is just what the
doctor ordered as Alice who develops her &#x27;powers&#x27; throughout. There are
plenty of tussles, zombie action, killer birds and it has some great
ideas, themes and a surprise electrifying closing.<br /><br />Under Russell Mulcahy direction it has it&#x27;s moments. There is one stand
out segment at a gas station, but again, like it&#x27;s predecessor it lacks
the pulsing, foreboding, suspense and mood created by Paul W.S.
Anderson in the first Resident Evil.
