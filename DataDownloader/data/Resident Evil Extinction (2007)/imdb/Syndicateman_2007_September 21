There are many things that went through my mind after Resident Evil 3:
Extinction ended that made me sad. One was, that even though I knew the
trailer looked horrible, maybe the movie might be a bit okay... and I
was wrong.<br /><br />You know, I had thought I had seen it all... and then I saw the 20
minute fight scene involving &quot;uniformed karate action zombies&quot; (I AM
NOT LIEING).<br /><br />The CG looks like it came from the deleted scenes from a batch of
Dragon Wars meets Dusk till Dawn meets a Sci-fi channel original TV
series CG movie.<br /><br />So finally, RE3 really is more of a Land of the Dead meets Day of the
Dead spin off, and thus when you combine 2 crappy zombie movies.... you
get quite possibly, the worst movie ever.... I give this movie a 3
because of those very few OK moments, but also because I realize that
the movie was suppost to be that bad because I fell for it and still
handed over my 7 dollars to go and see this monstrosity. Please do not
go see this movie... you will only be paying for the sequel to this
sequel sequel.
