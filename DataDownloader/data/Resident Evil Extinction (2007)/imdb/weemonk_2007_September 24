POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br /><br />I usually write about films that really stand out to me, good or bad. I
wouldn&#39;t usually write about big releases as hundreds do that but I had
to throw my pennies worth in on this.<br /><br />I like the RE games, not an avid fan but do enjoy them. I&#39;ve seen the
other 2 RE films and whilst disappointed that they turned into just
action flicks, take them for what they are. After all, it&#39;s Paul WS
Anderson who got his mitts on them. Mortal Kombat was fun, RE1 &amp; 2 were
fun and kept nice elements from the game. AVP....urgh.<br /><br />All those people saying &#39;Wow, this was great&#39; or &#39;Such a roller coaster
of action&#39; or &#39;Best RE film&#39; are missing the point. If this was a stand
alone film then maybe, yeah, bit of mindless action to keep you
going....but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s part of a series and it&#39;s not stayed within
the same vein as the first 2 films. This is why I for one was rather
bored as I watched this.<br /><br />Gone are the elements from the first 2 that relate to the games. Gone
is any form of character development (I know there wasn&#39;t lots in the
first 2 but there was some). Gone (and I felt the most important) is
the dark element from the first 2. Yes, I do mean as in lighting but
more so that sense of hopeless foreboding. After all, these films are
zombie films and any good zombie film has that underlying hopelessness
as let&#39;s face it, a zombie outbreak begins....you&#39;re pretty screwed
once it&#39;s out no matter what you do.<br /><br />Bravo to Mr Anderson for actually wanting to have more daytime settings
this time around but it just didn&#39;t work.....and what&#39;s with the virus
making everything baron wasteland? It&#39;s dull to look at. there is one
city shot near the end and this is what I wanted more of. Where was the
harm in continuing the story from where number 2 left off? <br /><br />What we end up with is the makers of the film saying &#39;you know the
premise, we&#39;re just going to try and dazzle you with action set pieces
and hope you&#39;re all in your teens in order not to notice that all we&#39;ve
done is make a poor film but robbed you of the entrance fee&#39;<br /><br />I&#39;m not in my teens and therefore not fooled. They still managed to
fail in the action areas for so many reasons.<br /><br />Paul WS Andreson said after the first film he would like to make a
trilogy. He should have stuck to that and used this as the opportunity
to find a fine balance between the first 2 films to have the series go
out on a bang....but he didn&#39;t and now we are faced with the prospect
of a 4th film.<br /><br />PS To the guy who did the mock up conversation of Paul and the
studio...excellent. You covered so many films that are ripped in this.
