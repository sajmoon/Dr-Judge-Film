Everybody loves Alice (Milla Jovovich). Every time I see her I think
she never looked this good. Although from a strictly logical
perspective this seems dodgy at best, it&#39;s true in a way, since she
keeps changing her look and refining her style. None of which helps
&quot;Extinction&quot;, of course. It has its moments, but those are the scenes
reprising Alice&#39;s stunning entrance from the first movie. &quot;Extinction&quot;
really feels like the third installment with the ideas running out.
They even lifted the subtitle of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise. It will
be especially disappointing to those who have seen the
out-of-this-world cinematic trailer. It&#39;s not so much that the trailer
compresses the movie&#39;s best bits. It&#39;s more that, in retrospect, the
trailer seems like a preview of an entirely different movie. Also, I&#39;m
not sold on Alice&#39;s outfit, credited to Jovovich&#39;s fashion label
Jovovich-Hawk. Although it doesn&#39;t look bad, it falls way short of the
red dress, no pun intended. Also, I have a nagging suspicion there is
no other girl in the world who could get away with these rags. The same
goes for her haircut. The role of the hard-bodied super-powered
trans-human desert doll obviously agrees with her. Get over Alice, I
tell myself. It doesn&#39;t work.
