Resident Evil 1 to 3 are by no means art or the best sci-fi ever
written, but at least they were entertaining, watchable and the plot
was somewhat interesting. In this movie none of the characters actions
or the story line makes any sense ..this can be seen within 3 minutes
of the movie..when a lead character puts her live at risk completely
unnecessary..as is revealed only a minute later.. future actions just
get more stupid and the story only gets worse from there..<br /><br />Even the bad guys are awful to watch..Take all irritating 1 dimensional
evil characters/ monsters of all the worst movies you have ever
seen..and you will find them all again in here..The heros are no
better.<br /><br />The only reason I give it 2 stars is as a result of the cinemtogrophy .
However the characters and the details of the story are so bad that
even in 4D this movie would only get 3 stars.. since it is &#x22;only in 3D&#x22;
I will give it 2 ..I need to quote somebody else: &#x22;The movie is a
disgrace even for resident evil.&#x22; I feel embarrassed for the people
that made this movie....heck even for people that acted in this
movie... they surely need to be desperate for money...
