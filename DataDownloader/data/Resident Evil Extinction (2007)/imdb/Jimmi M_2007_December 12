Okay, okay, enough of the lowly barely average reviews already.
Resident Evil Extinction solidly lives up to the bench mark laid by its
two predecessors and in my humble opinion, does it in an action packed,
well paced style. These films have never been anything but popcorn
laden guiltless fun, with wafer thin plots but plenty of scares, gun
play &amp; big flashy explosions. What story there is drives it forward at
a nice pace and I never once found myself tapping my foot or thinking
when&#39;s this going to end! Put simply I totally enjoyed my viewing of
R.E3 and if your a fan of the first and second, be sure to check it
out. Lets hope the saga continues its solid output in the future!
