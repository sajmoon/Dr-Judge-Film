There is nothing that I didn&#39;t like about this movie except that it
didn&#39;t feel like a complete story - more like a small part of a larger
story. Outside of that, the visuals were great, the characters were
interesting and the action was non-stop.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the setup of the Resident Evil movies: <br /><br />Resident Evil: A virus that transforms people into zombies is released
in an underground research facility and infects the workers.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse: The virus has now escaped and infected the
inhabitants of the city above the research facility.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction: The virus has now escaped the city and
infected the world.<br /><br />Furthermore, the somewhat amoral corporation (the same one responsible
for the virus in the first place) is working on a cure. The key lies in
getting the original blood of Milla Jovovich&#39;s character ... and the
story progresses from there.<br /><br />While the setup sounds interesting, the actual story told is too short.
Too much time is spent on human vs. zombie fights. While they are well
done, the plot doesn&#39;t get time to advance much ... and doesn&#39;t.<br /><br />It&#39;s too bad, because the visuals effects, characters and pacing are
really well done. In fact, the visuals of the decaying desert-like
surface juxtaposed with the few high-tech underground facilities left
in the world are particularly interesting to watch. All of these
aspects deserve a much more significant story.<br /><br />But it is what it is ... and it&#39;s still worth watching for anyone who
really likes the previous Resident Evil movies. Just know that not much
happens.
