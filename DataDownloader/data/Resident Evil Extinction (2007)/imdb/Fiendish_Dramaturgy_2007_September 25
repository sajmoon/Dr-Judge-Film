We saw this at our local hometown theater, Movies on the Parkway in
Sevierville, TN. I have to start this by saying that this installment
is a bit reminiscent of George A. Romero&#39;s 1985 cult classic, &quot;Day of
the Dead,&quot; in one major plot element. I won&#39;t give it away, but if
you&#39;re a Romero fan, you&#39;ll see it for yourself when you view this
film.<br /><br />This work is wholly entertaining, whether you are a fan of the games,
or not. There are new elements, old friends, and a plethora of great
innovations - some of which I&#39;ve never seen present anywhere, and a few
which were reminders of former masterpieces. I would name them, but to
do that would spoil these innovations for those of you who have yet to
experience them.<br /><br />The acting, direction, and quality were above par, while the style was
more that of the action flick with horror elements. The predecessors
were horror movies with great action. The suspense, the intrigue, the
atmosphere were all horror-oriented. This time, the horror elements
were minimized and the action reigned. This is not a bad thing, fans.
Without some change like this, the franchise will suffer franchise
sickness! As it stands, there is no danger of that happening.<br /><br />All in all? We were totally entertained, enjoyed our movie experience,
and were blown away by the wrap-up. See it for yourself to understand
what I mean.<br /><br />It rates an 8.9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
