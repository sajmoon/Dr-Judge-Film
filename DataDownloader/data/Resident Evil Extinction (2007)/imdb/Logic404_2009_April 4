2009_April 4 
I absolutely love the Resident Evil games (especially 4 and 5) but I
did not love the 1st Resident Evil movie. (gave it a 5) Passable but
that&#x27;s it. The 2nd movie was edited in such a way that it was
ultimately headache inducing. (gave it a 4) Could have been so much
more.<br /><br />I went into watching Resident Evil: Extinction with a feeling of slight
dread. How did this end up being beyond decent and the best so far in
the series? (not counting Degeneration).<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind is the Editing. Way better than the
first 2. Better Director and effects and a better movie comes our way.<br /><br />I would have rated this even higher but alas the ending &#x22;showdown&#x22; was
to normal and average for me. (The VERY last sequence was right back on
track though).<br /><br />Overall I was shocked how much better this was than the previous ones
were.
