I saw Resident evil I and II on DVD I would never pay big money to
watch this mess. Mostly I saw the second and third films for Oded Fehr.
Too bad they were stupid enough to kill him off. This movie is all
action, stupid action and no plot. But that&#39;s all you can expect from a
video game and a model turned actress. Too bad the writers refuse to
give you anything or anybody to truly like in these movies. And of
course they left it open ended. You don&#39;t know whether the others got
out of Vegas to their final destination and of course Alice swears
she&#39;ll be bad to finish off the board of bad guys who started the whole
thing. Well I won&#39;t be seeing Resident Evil IV unless they clone
Carlos. 3/10
