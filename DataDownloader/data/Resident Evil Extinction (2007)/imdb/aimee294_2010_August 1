I absolutely love the resident evil films as I have watched them all
lots of time, it might be just me who is taken in by Milla
Jovovich,Oded Fehr and Ali Larterand acting skills but this has to be
one of the best films yet and me being a huge fan of the films thought
they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do a better job. Although the film has its
flaws like the new easier killing zombies who can be killed by slashing
the through or shooting them in the mid-drift a slight flaw they didn&#x27;t
think through but it is still an outstanding film! The thing I love
most about this film is that it doesn&#x27;t fit into the stereotypical
zombie film, like running round a confined space like in the first film
or set in the middle of a big city over run by the undead like in the
second film instead it is set slap bang in the middle of a desert in
the day time only a really good director could make that type of a film
scary! This film is so grate because I can watch it 10 times in a row
and still not get bored, I really don&#x27;t no how they will top it for a
forth time!!!!
