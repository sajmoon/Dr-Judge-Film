Resident Evil Extinction is okay but still flawed from director Russell
Mulcahy who&#x27;s admirable in making this third film but the lack of
character development, more suspense, and a disappointing third act
surprise villain are what weighed this one down the most at least to
me. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla
Jovovich, Ali Larter, Ian Glen, Mike Epps, and Oded Fehr who&#x27;s part
like many others unfortunately is cut kind of short near the end. The
rest of the cast including a brief cameo appearance by Ashanti are okay
in their small parts but none of them get a chance to shine because
they&#x27;re written out of the movie rather quickly. The action sequences
are well executed and paced. The special effects including the zombies
and brief appearances by other creatures are impressive. The villain
near the end known as The Tyrant who Glen&#x27;s character turns into looks
terrifying and deadly but his anti-climatic showdown with Jovovich near
the conclusion is a letdown. The twist at the end was a bit of a
surprise and the ending does leave it open for another one but I think
three is enough for now. This movie isn&#x27;t really that bad there are
just flaws that weigh it down which could&#x27;ve been improved . Overall
Resident Evil Extinction is decent with enough action, bloody deaths,
good special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and solid
performances by the cast who make this third entry in the trilogy worth
watching but it could&#x27;ve been a lot better.
