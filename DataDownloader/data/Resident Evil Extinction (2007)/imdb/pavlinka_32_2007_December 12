It is hard to say whether it was better or not, because I haven t seen
any other parts of Resident evil. But in general, it was really boring
for me. From the beginning it was predictable what will happen and even
scenes that should frightened you were horrible. I didn&#39;t like graphics
as well, in some scenes you could clearly see that it was made by
computer. Zombies didn&#39;t frighten me at all, they were a little bit
funny. The only thing that was good was Milla Jovovich, she is really
great actor. There was nothing special about this movie. It is always
the same. Music and special effects were simple. If you like sci-fi
maybe you will like it, but if not as me, you will just waste time.
