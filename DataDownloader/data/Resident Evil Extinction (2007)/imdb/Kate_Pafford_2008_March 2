I love the first two Evil&#39;s, full of great action sequences, an
intriguing plot and some great scenes and dialog. But after watching
this one, I was left feeling a bit flat and disappointed. This was my
least favorite and I thought some of the scenes were trying too hard to
be like the other two films. Sure, it&#39;s better than some movies, but
it&#39;s the worst and the let down of the series. The fact Jill and
Angie&#39;s stories are just ignored completely upset me, and I thought
some of the scenes jumped too quickly. I hope they make a 4th just to
tie up all the loose ends and hopefully they&#39;ll get a different
director who will be able to take this series back into the right
direction.
