As I go through the 3rd film in the franchise 3 things have become
extremely clear to me.<br /><br />1)The movies have improved after outing specially on the technical
aspects like acting, direction special effects etc.<br /><br />2)The sequels always promise more and deliver less.<br /><br />3)The potential is increasingly underutilized.<br /><br />Which means that although technical aspects have improved after every
movie, the net rating of every movie has been roughly the same thanks
to the last 2 points.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that even though this is no.3 after I see the
end im actually looking forward to the sequel a trend which I&#39;ve
observed in all the 3 films.<br /><br />All this being said lets not forget that this is out and out mod-high
budget Action/Horror flick which is obviously more suited to the guys,
the element of horror is also increasingly decreasing through each
sequel, again a case of not living upto its potential (a post
apocalyptic zombie infected planet was perfect for genuine horror
moments).<br /><br />If any one expects more than a few great action scenes, good special
effects and a few hot chicks from such movies than hes a fool.<br /><br />This movie starts with promise and remains within a band throughout the
movie except for the climax where it lets down, for the first time in
the franchise. However the absolute end has me even more excited the
previous ones for the sequel.<br /><br />Milla looks good in a role she has made her own, like everyone else
many of whom a reprising their roles from the earlier films.The acting
was good all around, nothing special here and none was expected.<br /><br />Most of the scenes were good, ones that really stood out was the failed
rescue attempt and the fight in Vegas.<br /><br />Other than that this movie moved along at a leisurely pace which is
really why it should have excelled in the horror department and maybe
with some better dialogues, even some scientific mumbo jumbo/delving a
bit into the &quot;pseudo universes&quot; history would have actually made it
more interesting.<br /><br />The soundtrack was good once again and well used.<br /><br />I wonder how much the tobacco lobby (if there is indeed one)
contributed to the budget of this film??<br /><br />Despite the fact that i always expect something from this franchise,
given its simple no-nonsense approach to entertainment, this is the 3rd
film and I always expect at best what i got in the earlier movie (which
more than what i expect from most sequels).<br /><br />There is perverse pleasure in seeing things being killed/killing things
when there are no strings attached (your doing the people a favour by
killing them you see) and zombie movies/video-games have cashed on this
for decades.<br /><br />Fans will continue to enjoy this film, while there is something for the
first time watchers.<br /><br />People who love to find goofs, plot holes and continuity errors will
have field day in this movie. It is advised to stay away from these
activities, or only indulge in them in the slightly less interesting
parts of the film.<br /><br />If you are a fan you can pay premium rates, otherwise a DVD rental or
cheaper rates are recommended.<br /><br />-s OK dialogue almost no horror, delivers much less than it promises,
lackluster end, wasted potential, lacks the frantic pace of the earlier
movies.<br /><br />+/-s WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT??!!!.<br /><br />+s some really good scenes, once again promises a great sequel,
everyone does a good job, technically sound, well used soundtrack.<br /><br />total 6/10 ( i mean you cant really expect more, I would have given it
more for meeting expectations but it would have been detrimental. This
is by no means a fans only film but non-admirers would do much better
if they watched on DVD,TV or at cheaper matin&eacute;e rates).
