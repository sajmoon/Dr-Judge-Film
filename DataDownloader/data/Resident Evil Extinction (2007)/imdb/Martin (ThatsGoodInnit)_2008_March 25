2008_March 25 
I was very hyped for the release of this film, especially as i enjoyed
the first 2 so much, and have played the computer games. Also i like
Milla Jovovich a lot easily the best Female Action Superstar around
today, she can kick Ar&quot;&quot;. Very sexy and hugely enjoyable for all the
boys. She&#39;s made a big impact on the action flick scene, and raised
expectations for all future flicks, it&#39;s gone of the days where action
men dominated the movie scene, we now want to see hot chicks with guns,
and major cool action stunts and Milla always delivers, you want more
and more. This movie does have it&#39;s high points and continues the story
from the first 2 films, which is good, and often takes you back to the
first and second films, the film has evolved from much more than just a
zombie horror flick it has become a series like the games, and has been
left wide open for a 4th because more needs to be answered, and I&#39;m
dying to see what the creators come up with next. And yes we do get a
lot of blood, a lot of guns, a lot of zombies with more dogs and
crows!!!! it was nice to see the cast from the second film return. I
don&#39;t have anything that bad to say about it really just didn&#39;t quite
reach the mark the second did, but still highly enjoyable. It was nice
to see Ali Larter from Final Destination, i find she looks a lot like
Milla, and before now got them both mixed up. I feel they could&#39;ve used
Ali more, but most likely didn&#39;t want to take the shine off Milla, not
that you could! these films are her own.
