Complain about my score, I don&#39;t care. This movie was AWESOME!! It
didn&#39;t exactly scare me, but it gave me the same feeling I got when I
played RE1 for the first time. It was fast and the action barely
stopped. It actually felt like survival horror.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Wesker&#39;s role in the movie. I was a little worried
about how he would fit in. I know, I know, he did nothing but sit in a
chair and talk. He did that in RE4, too. From the games I&#39;ve played, I
thought the producers had his character&#39;s attitude perfect. It seems to
me they are making him the one who is responsible for everything that
has been happening. Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii should cover that,
though. As soon as I left the theater, I had the urge to go home play
RE4. <br /><br />Which, in my opinion, is what a movie should do. Well, maybe not
inspire you to play a game, but at least make you want to play the game
that the movie is based on.
