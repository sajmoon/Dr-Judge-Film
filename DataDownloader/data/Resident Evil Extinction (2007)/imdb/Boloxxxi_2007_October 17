This third outing was disappointing because after two successful
outings (above average releases) Resident Evil had become for me a sort
of &quot;brand name&quot; you could trust. My problem with this third installment
is that no real care was given to quality of story, characters, and
special effects. I wish, for instance, that it had a more suspense and
some more surprises; more interesting supporting characters (none of
them had any personality folks); and was more visually imaginative.<br /><br />Basically our heroine is now aimlessly wandering the dusty plains on a
dusty motorcycle in a dusty coat (reminding me of some heroic western
tough guy if you substitute the motorcycle for a horse). The story
begins with her waking up naked reminiscent of the previous Resident
Evil but she&#39;s covered by a white sheet and we don&#39;t get to see
anything (Damn it to hell!!). Somehow managing to score some rugged,
bad-ass girl duds, a motorcycle, and various weaponry, she eventually
hooks up with a bus load and truck load of survivors (unzombified) who
are looking for other survivors and the promised land, or something. In
the mean time some mad scientist who has been trying to find a way to
control the zombies discovers that our heroine, the original Alice, is
still out there somewhere with the precious T-virus antidote in her
blood. So he sets out to snare her so he can bring her back to his lab
and have his way with her (Can you blame him?).<br /><br />Finally: This -in my opinion- is an &quot;average&quot; flick unlike it&#39;s 2
predecessors. I recommend it if you have nothing better to do right now
and in need of some mild (standard) zombie entertainment. Before I went
to see this movie, I didn&#39;t read or listen to any reviews; I just
grabbed my wallet and crammed as many nieces and nephews in my car as I
could and sped off like a jack rabbit on crack (I do so love kick-ass
women, folks). Well I won&#39;t be doing that again. I must have blown 80
bucks on that mad, impetuous day (I&#39;m like a 5 yr old when I get
excited). -Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not sorry I saw it. I&#39;m just sorry I
rushed when I could have leisurely waited for an invite from someone
who was going (and paying) or who rented it or bought the DVD later on.
Listen, you might think better of this 3rd Resident Evil than I do. I
saw, for instance, that another IMDb reviewer gave it a whopping &quot;9
stars&quot;. What the F**K!!! -My eyes almost flew out of my head. But he or
she saw what they saw and I have to respect that. I&#39;m just one opinion
in a sea of them. Love, Boloxxxi.
