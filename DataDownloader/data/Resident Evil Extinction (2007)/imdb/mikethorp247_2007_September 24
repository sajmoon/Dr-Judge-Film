I would just have to say that I am a harsh movie rater cause I know
what I like and I think that people might like the samething&#39;s that I
do when it comes to movies. There is just TOO many reason why I gave
this a 10 out of 10. I am not going to be like a lot of people that are
doing reviews on this movie and spoil it for you. I can&#39;t stand people
that do that. But the Bio-Hazards (zombies) look even more real than
the first to movies. They look like something that Stephen King or Rob
Zombie would have came up with. The way that the 2nd movie ends will
make since to you when it gets 15 to 20 minutes in the movie. The only
bad part in the movie is the beginning (flashbacks of the first to
movies). Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, and Mike Epps does a killer (no pun
attended) killer job on their roles. They finally put Claire Redfield
(Ali Larter)in the movie and she kicked a** also. For the people that
played the game Albert Wesker (STARS) is in the movie and they have the
right guy to play the role and that is cause the guy is kinda like a
a**hole. The main guy (monster) at the end kinda makes Nemises look
like a little school girl at church. The only thing that I really don&#39;t
agree with is the way that it ends. It makes you want more and that is
the only downfall to the movie. But pose to the questions on here there
will be a 4th movie and it picks up with Clarie, Chris, and Jill (chick
from the 2nd movie). In closing I would just like to state..... WHAT
THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!!!!!!!!!! GET
YOUR BUTT OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND SEE THIS DANG MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! ITS TO
DIE FOR
