How many second sequels can you think of that hold up as well as the
original or even the first sequel? RE: EXTINCTION does just that,
thanks to a clever plot, fine performances from several seasoned actors
plus some eye-popping special effects and set designs. A ragtag group
of Raccoon City survivors is trying to find its way to a place of
safety, and ends up crossing paths with Alice, who by now is so
powerful she can actually control the elements. Meanwhile, the creeps
back at the Umbrella Corp. are still after Alice, mainly for her blood.
There are fights galore against an endless army of zombies, but the
most amazing battle occurs between the survivors and thousands of
zombie crows. For those old enough to remember Hitchcock&#39;s THE BIRDS,
this confrontation plays out like that old classic on steroids. Oded
Fehr from THE MUMMY movies and Ali Larter of the FINAL DESTINATION
flicks are on hand as leaders of the caravan of survivors. Milla
Jovovich is once again on hand as Alice, but there is reason to believe
this will be her final performance in that role should yet another
sequel get green-lighted. The end is a real kick in the head, by the
way. The film has some awesomely gory moments and is not suitable for
young children.
