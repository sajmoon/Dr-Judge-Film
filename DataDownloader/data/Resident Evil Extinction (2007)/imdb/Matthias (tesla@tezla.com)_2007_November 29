OK, just finished this third RE and unfortunately(like the second one)
it doesn&#39;t come close to the heights of the first. It totally lacks the
suspense, eeriness and claustrophobia that made the first one stand
out. Yes sure, we get a few jump scenes but that doesn&#39;t redeem this
movie. What we get is a kind of blend between &quot;Dawn of the dead(the
remake)&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;The Birds&quot; and a little &quot;Mad Max&quot; thrown
in for good measure.<br /><br />If we for one moment forget that the first RE exists this stands on
it&#39;s own as an OK action movie. Not great, not bad but OK. The
production value, effects and the little acting there is are good so
thankfully it doesn&#39;t come across as a b-movie.<br /><br />For me Milla is the main reason it survives from being really bad. She
goes about her business as before with new powers &aacute; la invisible girl
from Fantastic Four. Apparently she had that in the second installment
too but it was a while since i saw that one so i don&#39;t remember exactly
what she did with her powers in that one. The rest of the characters
actually don&#39;t make any impact more than support as a vehicle to
support a second storyline filling out film time. We get a few extra
explosions, neck bitings and shootouts thanks to them.<br /><br />To the film moguls : Please stop with more RE sequels, i think you have
made enough damage as it is to this franchise.
