now i know that the title of this comment and the rating i gave this
film doesn&#39;t really go together. as a film based on the popular games
(which I&#39;m a fan of) it HARDLY sticks to the games. thats where the
title of this comment comes in, but as for the movie itself, looking at
it as a stand alone film (looking passed its based on a game) it is a
good movie, which is where the 8/10 comes in. despite it being a very
good film, it seems as if the creators (of the films) wanted to make a
third film so bad, that they didn&#39;t want to wait for another RE game
(despite RE4) so they just made up their own story (sticking to
umbrella and t-virus). T-virus whipes out entire world, convoy
traveling across Nevada desert, etc.<br /><br />good-lots of action. crows are finally used. different take on zombies
(fast &quot;crimson heads&quot; zombies) bad-literally not based on any of the
games, no Nevada desert in any of the games. Ali larter was good, but
she isn&#39;t a Claire redfield. actor who played Wesker-good, but his
character of just sitting behind a desk-bad. i wanted to see him in
action.<br /><br />Summary: if you are a true RE gamer and are WANTING/EXPECTING this film
to cover one of the games, don&#39;t expect too much. if you are a fan but
is willing to accept they (only) kept the main principles (t-virus,
umbrella, zombies) then you will enjoy. in my personal opinion, i think
they could have covered RE: Code Veronica instead of, t-virus whipes
out entire world plot.
