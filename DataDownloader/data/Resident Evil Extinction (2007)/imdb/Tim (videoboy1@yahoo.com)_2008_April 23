First off let me say this, &quot;I really liked the film!&quot; I have read a
quite a few reviews of this film, and some of them were positive a lot
of them were negative. Some people were poking holes in the plot of the
story, credibility, the acting, the writing, the directing, etc. Let me
tell you something you find your favorite critically acclaimed Oscar
film.You look at every single possible angle, really put every scene
under a microscope you are bound to find mistakes. Also when one does
this, does it not take away some of the joy of sitting back and
watching a movie? <br /><br />Next I will say is this &quot;People lighten up; the film does not take
itself so seriously why should you? Have you seen other zombie films? I
have. Have you ever wonder about the depth of characters? Especially
the supporting cast? The answers to these questions should be no. I
mean you and I both know they are going to get it. The whole point to
going to movies like this is to suspend one&#39;s own disbelief and to let
your mind be entertained. I mean that is why so many of use read comic
books, futuristic novels, about science, space travel,horror etc. Also
to people who have said oh it rips of that movie, or that! Here&#39;s some
food for thought, the writer himself has said that he wanted to pay a
tribute to movies like Mad Max that inspired him, but put his own
updated twist on it. What&#39;s wrong with that?...Nothing! Hell creative
play writes have been doing this for a couple hundred years with
Shakespeare. Not that I am implying the Anderson is any were near the
same league as good old Billy Shakespeare. But if something inspires
you, you may want to put your own twist and stamp on it.&quot; So in
conclusion you don&#39;t like it&#133; Fine go off and watch something else.
