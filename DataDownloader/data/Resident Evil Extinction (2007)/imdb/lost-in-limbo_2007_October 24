2007_October 24 
Never been much of a fan of the first two films (nor the video games),
but this one I thought is somewhat an improvement in that it was
entertaining and less showy. Thankyou. However I wouldn&#39;t make too much
of it, when I still found it to be quite one-note with its plotting and
covered with terribly conceived special effects. This one looks cheap,
and it kinda shows in many aspects. What it concentrates is on its
flashy style to storm up blistering action sequences and lets the
expansive camera-work do its trick. The barren locations are well shot
and the action is well handled without overplaying it. I wasn&#39;t so
crazy about the erratic editing of the previous two &quot;Resident Evil&quot;
films, but this one wasn&#39;t so bad and more often suitably focused. Some
edgy, gripping and scorching set pieces do standout and the glum tone
holds tight, but Paul W. Anderson&#39;s choppy story (which seems like a
mixture of the first two movies) doesn&#39;t skip away from the basic
one-tune to have much of a dent. Minimal post-apocalyptic b-grade
nonsense with a standard script. The characters are so paper-thin, that
they&#39;re never really annoy or gain your interest. To make matters worse
the climax is pretty much a whimper. The performances are nothing
special, and everyone goes by in a forgettable fashion. Well nearly
everyone. Milla Jovovich&#39;s hell-bent turn is compelling, and Oded Fehr
has a likable presence. Ali Larter is simply going throw the motions,
and Ashanti is wasted but that&#39;s no complaint here. Russell Mulcahy&#39;s
glossy direction stays snappy, and controlled. He throws in his fair
share of cheap thrills, and the bloody make-up f/x are soundly
executed. Some visuals do remind you of Romero&#39;s vastly superior &quot;Day
of the Dead (1985)&quot;. The soundtrack doesn&#39;t lend much of an impact, and
the same can be said about the music score. Filled with flaws, but it
works as enjoyable brainless fluff that keeps a fast-pace.
