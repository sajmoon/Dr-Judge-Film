2007_October 30 
This has not been the year for the &quot;Part III.&quot; Despite the fact that I
(personally) really liked &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean 3&quot;...and to a
lesser degree &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;...those films were not on top of their
predecessors, and bordered on disappointment (and let&#39;s not even
mention &quot;Shrek 3&quot;). Same goes for &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction,&quot; the
third part in the series. After the slam-bang sequel that was &quot;Resident
Evil: Apocalypse,&quot; you&#39;d think that the third installment would surpass
or at least equal the previous film. It doesn&#39;t! &quot;Extinction&quot; takes
place a few years after &quot;Apocalypse&quot; where the world has pretty much
ended and is in a state of global ruin due to the zombie outbreak.
Alice is now a lone gunman, traveling stateside helping those in need
and fighting the zombies. Alice&#39;s accomplices from &quot;RE:2&quot;: Carlos
Olivera (Oded Fuhr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) have now joined a small band
of survivors led by an ambitious survivor named Claire (Ali Larter), in
hopes to find some sort of sanctuary.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Umbrella Corporation stills functions from a far
underground facility, in which head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen)
hopes to somehow control the zombies using whatever memory is left in
their rotted brain (&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; anyone?). However, his plans
change when he finds out that his prized experiment, &quot;Alice,&quot; is still
alive and active (you might recall she was genetically altered by Dr.
Isaacs at the end of the last film).<br /><br />Alice then regroups with her lost friends, and tells Claire that
there&#39;s a strong possibility of sanctuary in Alaska, where there has
been reports of no infection. So, the team heads to Nevada to gear up
enough gasoline to make the long trek to Alaska, but Vegas is Zombie
Central and Dr. Isaacs is hot on their trail. I&#39;ll stop here.<br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; is not a bad addition to the series, but
it&#39;s a disappointing one. I wanted that feeling I got when I watched
the second film, a balls to the wall action/horror flick, with solid
suspense and an even more solid storyline and NEW SURPRISES.
&quot;Extinction&quot; is basically the same formula of the first two but less
exciting. Sure it could be labeled a &quot;Mad Max&quot; with zombies but that&#39;s
were the coolness ends. No surprises, nothing different, just the same
formula gore and the same formula Alice kicking ass. The cast basically
does their part well enough: Milla is always cool and sexy as Alice,
Ali Larter is her normal sexy self. It was great to see character actor
Linden Ashby in this one (you might remember him as Johnny Cage in
&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;) and Iain Glen is excellent as the evil Dr. Isaacs. But
they kill off characters you&#39;ve grown to care for like as if they were
fourth or fifth rate characters...and you&#39;re left with a predictable
final fight sequence and then the movie is over.<br /><br />Now I like that stuff, which is why I actually enjoyed it, but I wanted
more. I sat in that theater expecting something, and I didn&#39;t get it.
So I was forced to put myself in another mindset and there I saw &quot;RE:3&quot;
for the actual decent flick it is.<br /><br />I&#39;m prepared to give &quot;RE:3&quot; a recommendation but with a warning...it&#39;s
the weakest of the series, and do not expect a slam-bang flick. There&#39;s
zombies, there&#39;s gore and a few cool action sequences, but it&#39;s nothing
spectacular.
