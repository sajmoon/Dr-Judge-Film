Woeful third instalment in the movie-based-on-the-game series. Plotwise
(what little there is) steals shamefully from Romero, especially Day of
the Dead. My jaw actually dropped during the training and pacification
of the zombie scene - straight from Day! Aside from flimsy plot,
average direction (oh how Russell has sunk since his Highlander days)
and uninspired acting, the film is actually a 90 minute advert for
Sony. To actually try and count the amount of Sony products clearly
plugged in the film will not be possible until the DVD release but
let&#39;s just say, Screen Gems had more than a movie in mind when parent
company Sony approved this mess. As if this was not blatant enough,
watch for how even in the darkest scenes you can clearly see the names
Sony and Viao due to extra lighting on the brand items in shot.
Shocking that cinema has come to this. AJ
