I&#39;m glad there are a lot of people who liked the film. I thought it was
a great addition to the trilogy. The action was constant and they
continued the story from the last movie well. There were a few plot
twists and great action. Isn&#39;t that all you expect from these movies. <br /><br />I keep watching people bash this movie and wonder what the expectation
was. Did you want a romantic comedy or a huge box office smash. I
figured when I walked in to see an action movie with a lot of violence
and gore. Guess what I got. The story line was o.k. and the character
development was zero but it still was enjoyable.<br /><br />If you want action and violence and an enjoyable movie go see this. If
you want a masterpiece go to a film festival and whine about everything
there in your non-paid critic environment. Take my word on this, none
of these will be the greatest movie you have ever seen, but they can
sure entertain you for an hour and a half.
