I am a huge fan of the video game series; I&#39;ve played &amp; completed
almost every Resident Evil game there is. The first one is one of my
most favourite films and the second was also good but not better than
the first. After watching the ending of the second I knew that there
will be a third instalment but I had no idea how they will continue.<br /><br />To be honest I didn&#39;t really like Resident Evil: Extinction when the
first time I seen it. My friend wanted to watch it and I watched it
again to give him company and then I liked it. Every scene made better
sense and was much more entertaining. The movie was set in the Nevada
desert and filled with intense special effects and more zombie
terror!The story was continued very well from the second one and was
very different, intelligent and original. Albert Weskar &amp; Claire
Redfield were introduced and they didn&#39;t have much to do in the film
maybe they will in the fourth part, which will be called Resident Evil:
Afterlife and Leon will probably be in it.<br /><br />The zombies look like sand zombies and they are odd but it was a good
idea because the whole world is covered with sand. There were a few
jumpy moments and you have no idea whenever they can appear. The best
scene is when Alice was fighting Isaacs near the end and my friend said
that &quot;He is similar to Tyrant in the first Resident Evil game&quot; but I
don&#39;t think so because Tyrant has a claw hand. He was very similar to a
monster in Resident Evil: Code Veronica X that has a small head and is
able to stretch its arm out and grab you.<br /><br />Overall it is the kind of film that gets better the more times you
watch it and is well made for a post-apocalyptic thriller. It was made
with a budget of $45 million &amp; grossed the most money out of all three
about $147 million worldwide.
