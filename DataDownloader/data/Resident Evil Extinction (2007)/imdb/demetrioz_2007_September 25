come on, giving a part of this horror action franchise to this lousy
director, what a blatant mistake. I even gave him the shadow of a
doubt, but no, Mulcahy has demonstrated several times that he has a
great capability for letting us horror fans down. <br /><br />please even if he is your good friend or maybe because he charges
really cheap for movie, please please don&#39;t ever give him a good idea
like this one to ruin, give him something else.<br /><br />paul w.s. anderson and mulcahy, don&#39;t direct a movie that you are not
passionate about, please, ameke yourself and us all a favor. the only
parts in his film that are not boring are the ones that we already have
seen in the trailers. Mulcahy is not a good horror action director. You
should have contacted someone like Stephen norrington instead.
