This is the worthy sequel to Resident Evil! Wasn&#39;t fund of Resident
Evil 2.<br /><br />I just love postapocolyptic movies, and this movie was really
fulfilling! I was bored at no time, and felt that the story was
interesting, and with the ending a fourth movie would be great.<br /><br />I know that Paul W.S. Anderson did not direct this movie, BUT is you
enjoyed Soldier (1998), Resident Evil (2002), Event Horizon (1997) and
Mortal Kombat (1995) you will also enjoy this movie. It&#39;s a very
entertaining movie, but not very deep.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie you will also like movies like: No Escape
(1994), Fortress (1993) and even Deep Rising (1998), though Deep Rising
isn&#39;t postapocolyptic, but has a nice setting though.<br /><br />Enjoy! You can write me if you want to exchange recommendations in
movies, I&#39;m really into 80s action :)
