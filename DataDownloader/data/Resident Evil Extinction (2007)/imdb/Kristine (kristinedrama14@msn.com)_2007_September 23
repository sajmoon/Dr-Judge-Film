Resident Evil: Extinction is now the third installation in the series
and so far it&#39;s the best! I saw this in the theater last night and I
can&#39;t tell you when the last time was that I was genuinely excited to
see scene after scene. I think Resident Evil: Extinction is my favorite
in the series so far, it had great action, horrifying scares, and an
actual story that could send chills down your spine. Milla is still
kicking butt and she is so awesome in this film, not to mention that
her telekinetic powers are growing stronger, so she&#39;s becoming a much
more advanced fighter against the living dead. Resident Evil:
Extinction is everything you could hope for: action, horror, a little
romance, science fiction, and drama. The story was terrific because who
knows how far we are from screwing up and possibly destroying the
world? Scary to think about it.<br /><br />Basically the entire world is now a desert, most of the world&#39;s
population is dead from the virus that is making them into the living
dead. Most of the survivors are using the roads for survival and trying
to kill as many of these zombies as they can while looking for food,
water, and a safe place to live. Alice comes across a group and stays
with them to help them out and she&#39;s back with Carlos once again. While
it seems they are in the clear and safe, it turns out that Alice is
being watched by Umbrella and they want her blood to create super
zombies with incredible strength. They&#39;ve been cloning her to see if
they can get some close enough to her capability, but when Alice finds
out about this, they may wanna rethink their plan.<br /><br />The only thing I regret about getting into the Resident Evil films is
now I have to wait for the next sequel! LOL, it&#39;s just like a TV
series, you can&#39;t wait until the next episode because the previous one
had such a great ending. Oh, well, I knew what I was getting into.
Resident Evil: Extinction is one heck of an awesome film and I highly
recommend that you go see it, especially if you&#39;ve seen the previous
two films. The cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this
film and it&#39;s a cool looking film that will keep you entertained from
beginning to end.<br /><br />8/10
