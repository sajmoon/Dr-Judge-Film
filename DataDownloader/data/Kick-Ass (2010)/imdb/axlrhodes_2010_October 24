Kick-Ass wastes no time in establishing itself as a superhero comedy
film with a clear and precise intention of what it is.The opening scene
sets the tone for one of the most daring,funny,exhilarating and
downright funny experiences you will ever have watching a film. The
script is witty and knowing and while the film dodges &#x27;movie&#x27; clich&#xE9;s
at every turn,it does a great job of embracing and riffing on clich&#xE9;s
within the context of the superhero genre.The idea of the superhero
vigilante has been done to death with Batman and Watchmen in recent
years,but neither of those films manage to come close to being nearly
half as fun as Kick-Ass.Remember films like My Super Ex Girlfriend?
Well forget them now, this is how to have fun with superheroes. Another
interesting success within Kick Ass is that it knows the world can be
an evil place and it doesn&#x27;t shy away from the darkness. There are
tough scenes within this film,but levity is never trailing too far
behind. The last word must go to Hit Girl. I have never seen a film in
which i have come away feeling as thought the 11 year old girl was the
coolest thing on screen. I have now. 10/10
