This movie should come with a disclaimer &#x22;Only for kids&#x22;. Having loved
Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad, I had high expectations from
&#x22;Kick Ass&#x27;. To say that I was tortured to the core would be an
understatement. For one this is not a comedy. The lewd language makes
it unsuitable for kids and the fairytale ending makes it unsuitable for
adults or sane people. One would expect this title to get a 2.8 rather
than 8.2 which it currently has at IMDb. There is virtually no story
line for the movie. This is rather a weird slap-stick comedy. The
director tries to make up for this by adding a few pointless emotions
to the end. In short this is one movie one would like to forget. Or
better still not watch. Strictly avoid.
