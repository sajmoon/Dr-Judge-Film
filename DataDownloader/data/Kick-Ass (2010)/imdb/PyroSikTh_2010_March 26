Literally just got back from Kick-Ass Go watch this movie now. I cannot
praise it enough.<br /><br />Casting was perfect. Music was perfect. Characters were perfect.
Direction was perfect. Visuals were perfect. Action scenes were
perfect. Comedy was perfect. Story was perfect. Kick-Ass is perfect.<br /><br />In fact. Kick-Ass is so good, I cannot find fault. Nicholas Cage&#x27;s
short and sharp speech as if there was a full stop after every word
while he was dressed up as Big Daddy was pretty annoying....but at the
same time...perfect.<br /><br />The comic moments were genuinely laugh out loud funny, and there were
plenty of them. The heart-warming moments were so heart-warming you
couldn&#x27;t help but smile. The emotional scenes were so moving you could
almost cry. The action scenes were so spot on. Everything from the
action itself to the music and camera angles couldn&#x27;t have been better.
Genuinely thrilling and exciting, and the bad-assery was literally
bad-ass and...dare I say it...they Kicked-Ass!! Actually amazing.
Seriously. I cannot praise this film enough. Just go and see it.<br /><br />10/10 And no, the rating isn&#x27;t the result of it being the shiny new
film. It earned every single star.
