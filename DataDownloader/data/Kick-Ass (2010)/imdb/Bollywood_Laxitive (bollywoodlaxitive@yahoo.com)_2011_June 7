I registered on IMDb for one reason. To alert people to how incredibly
bad, painful and generally nauseating this movie is. The acting is bad.
The story is pure drivel. What makes this film truly remarkable is that
it was made not as a mere opportunity to skim money from the trailer
park crowd. Instead, this film is deeply self-referential: What you see
are a bunch of free-styling actors &#x27;acting&#x27;. You don&#x27;t see them as the
characters they are trying to play. There seems to be no script and if
you take a good look you can see a microphone occasionally. I admire
the attempt(key word) put forth here. I know what they were trying to
do, and their efforts are commendable. That is to say, their hearts
were certainly I the right place. But, if they&#x27;re going to do it, do it
right. Lovecraft fans get enough abuse as is; don&#x27;t add to the store of
that by producing perfectly awful movies such as this one.<br /><br />I had heard all the buzz and thought that maybe, at long last, we
Lovecraft fans had finally produced a quality movie on a par with
Hollywood productions. Dutifully, I invited and bought DVDs for several
friends to attend with me. The movie was so amateurish, so fraught with
plot holes and so poorly edited both pre- and post-production that I
was mortified. Since I work in this industry, it was readily apparent
to me how easy it would have been to maintain plot integrity and
thereby give the production the quality it was lacking. I was
astonished that no effort was made to do so. I can, however, give this
movie credit for teaching me never to listen to hype and always preview
any Kick-Ass movie before purchasing three extra diskettes at $30USD
a-piece. I then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They didn&#x27;t
get it and nobody enjoyed it.<br /><br />In short, save your money on this one. When it comes out on Youtube.com
(where it should have gone straight to), coerce a friend to download it
and watch it in your place. be sure to tell him to pay special
attention to the scene regarding &#x22;the Kick-Ass sockpuppet&#x22;. It&#x27;s pretty
much an insult to the audience&#x27;s ability to figure things out.
