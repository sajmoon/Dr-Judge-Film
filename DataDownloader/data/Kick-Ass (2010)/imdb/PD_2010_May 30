Excellent movie, nice narration, nice story line.<br /><br />Excellent depiction of what/ how a guy would dream to become a
superhero.<br /><br />I just loved it.<br /><br />I would heart-fully give it 10 stars, but for the fact of certain
scenes &#x26; language that make it not suitable for kids to watch it.<br /><br />But thinking of it on the angle it was filmed.<br /><br />It is for the youth to start doing something to change things, from the
corrupted way it is.<br /><br />Double hats off. i kind of missed Big daddy.2 bad they had to kill him.<br /><br />Every aspect of the movie = 10 stars, except for language<br /><br />Overall verdict and rating<br /><br />A must watch movie for any Marvel/Comic fan, and those who aren&#x27;t get
ready to be a fan of KickAss.
