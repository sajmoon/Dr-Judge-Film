Director Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; isn&#x27;t a spoof of a superhero film
at all. Rather it is its&#x27; own superhero film. It gives us a lead who
wants to be a superhero not because of some higher calling, or a
tragedy that would derail most of us but instead is given about 45
seconds of screen time. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just looking
for a little purpose in life. He&#x27;s a comic book nut to boot and so he
dons a green wet suit and is off to disrupt some petty crime in New
York City. It&#x27;s from here the movie takes off, spiraling into dark
satire, hysterical parallels, gritty and gory action, etc. Did I
mention it also features one of the most controversial and entertaining
characters in cinema history? Dave&#x27;s a pretty normal guy. He pines
after Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), has a pair of funny but dorky best
friends (Clark Duke of &#x22;Hot Tub Time Machine&#x22; among them), and makes
deposits in a certain warehouse. Once he takes up the mantra of
&#x22;kick-ass&#x22; he finds himself way over his head. After all he&#x27;s not Bruce
Wayne or Clark Kent. This has shades of &#x22;Watchmen&#x22; in it. If normal
people take up the title of a costumed vigilante they&#x27;re just still
human. The costume is a persona and a representation of an ideal. It&#x27;s
not who they are. Dave meets a father-daughter pair who could care
less. Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) looks oddly like Batman and his
daughter Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) has been raised to make the Dark
Knight look about as threatening as Katherine Hiegl. Why would he raise
her so? The movie gives a perverted sort of explanation that makes
sense in some odd way. The pair are after Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong) a
ruthless mob boss. This mob boss has a son who soon goes by the name of
&#x22;Red Mist&#x22; (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Is he a ruthless youngster like
his dad or does he simply admire his papa? The answers all come one way
or another.<br /><br />In case you didn&#x27;t guess Dave is in way over his head. His romance and
motivations mean nothing once he realizes just what his adopted
profession actually entails. That seems to be the general point of
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;. Superheroes can&#x27;t exist in the real world because what they
strive to do is simply impossible. To oust organized crime syndicates
and real world crisis&#x27;s is the job of many men and women, not three
extraordinary individuals. The appeal of a film like this is that it&#x27;s
set in the real world. Dave doesn&#x27;t triumph in his first outings as a
comic-book icon. In fact one is downright traumatic. His sobering
presence in the film gives it the grounding it needs with the likes of
Big Daddy, Hit-Girl and D&#x27;Amico shocking their way across the screen.<br /><br />Now for the issue of &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22;. If someone were to say they hated the
film or couldn&#x27;t watch it because of her you really can&#x27;t argue with
them. Her character is violent, so mature and the very thought of a
pre-teen doing what she does is so scary that present a mountain of
moral dilemma? Is it wrong for someone to write her character in such a
harsh yet humorous way? What&#x27;s the point of her character? What about
her dad? Best not to think of it all that way. She&#x27;s a walking,
talking, punching, kicking, shooting, swearing send-off of the genre.
You want outrageous? Rorsarach would blush. You want sinister and
threatening? The Joker would be at a loss for words. In a genre where
disbelief must be put on-ice for hours at a time Hit-Girl is its&#x27;
ultimate symbol. Forget about the fact that she utters the &#x22;C&#x22; word
with the frequency of Joe Pesci, or that she has the maturity of 30
year old Soviet sniper, or that her daddy time is spent both at a
bowling alley and taking slugs in the her Kevlar-protected chest. She&#x27;s
killing the bad guys and that&#x27;s all that matters in a superhero film.
The aspect of morality only matters if the good guys don&#x27;t have it
because we know the villains don&#x27;t.<br /><br />Any film is nothing without it&#x27;s&#x27; performances. Superhero films are
especially vulnerable in this area. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; provides us with a cast
that knew exactly what movie they were making and how they were
supposed to fit into it. Cage is at his best here. He brings a
controlled intensity to his best roles and Big Daddy is no different.
As cool and ferocious as he is you can&#x27;t help but be totally taken
aback by him. Johnson is perfect as the not-to-vulnerable lead. His
angst is presented with both hilarity and honesty. Mintz-Plasse will
forever be known as &#x22;McLovin&#x22; but his character has some real depth
here. He wants to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps but does he really
know what his dad does, and once he figures out will that change? The
film gives a classic answer. Then there is issue of his dad played by
Mark Strong. He is fast becoming his generations&#x27; definitive
villain-actor. He was sinister and stout in &#x22;Sherlock Holmes&#x22; but he&#x27;s
a downright a****** here. That&#x27;s a compliment Mark, can&#x27;t wait to see
you in &#x22;Robin Hood&#x22;.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t claim to be a comic-book geek but I get giddy over any great
film. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is just that. It belongs in the pantheon with &#x22;Batman
Begins&#x22;, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, &#x22;Spider-Man 2&#x22;, &#x22;X2&#x22; and &#x22;Watchmen.&#x22; Those
films all chose to deal with their conflicts both real and fantasy with
ferocious action and well-written and serious plot points. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
certainly succeeds as an action film but never forgets just outrageous
it is. The result is something affecting, shocking, thrilling and
funny. Bravo.<br /><br />Visit me at celluloidlove.wordpress.com
