Had &#x22;Watchmen&#x22; not existed I would say that this is a very unique and
original take on the &#x27;Superhero&#x27; mythos and in many ways it still is,
besides all the clich&#xE9;&#x27;s and stereo-types, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; some how still
feels fresh and original and really makes super-heroism or vigilantism
realistic and relevant for todays times. If somebody really did put on
a wetsuit and a mask and starting fighting thugs on the street, you bet
your arse somebody would video that and stick it on &#x27;YouTube&#x27;! Instant
fame! A trend would start and before you know it, more vigilantes or
&#x22;heroes&#x22; would show up for sure. The cast is absolutely brilliant in
their roles and i must say &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is a welcome return to form for
Nicholas cage who&#x27;s films of late have seriously been sucking a whole
lot. His character &#x22;Batma....&#x22; oops, I mean &#x22;Big daddy&#x22; is brilliantly
acted and portrayed with just the right mix of campiness and
seriousness that it works so well and makes for one of the strongest
characters in the film. His daughter and side-kick &#x22;Hit-girl&#x22; is a
psychotic 12 year old girl who swears like a trooper (drops the ol&#x27;
C-bomb numerous times) and brutally kills villains without so much as a
blink of an eye! Her scenes make for all the films best action
sequences without a doubt! Aaron Johnson who played the title character
of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is an actor of whom I&#x27;m not familiar with so I had no
previous expectations to go by which was good as I felt his acting was
fine and worked well for the character he played. The crazy thing about
&#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; which will either be it&#x27;s downfall or it&#x27;s saving grace is
that it&#x27;s a mixed bag of genre&#x27;s going from typical superhero adventure
film, to side-splitting &#x22;superbad&#x22; style humour to overly violent gore
fest to serious dead-pan scenes....it works for the most part and is
definitely worth a watch for anybody who likes violent films....or
comedies....or superhero films.....or action films....or dramatic
films......(you get where I&#x27;m going with this). <br /><br />In short; &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; kicked ass!!!
