Incredible movie, I need awhile to get my mind around the genre bending
of the story line.<br /><br />The main characters are your typical Super Bad bunch of nerds, dorks or
geeks. The main story line is a tale of revenge with a bizarre mix of
characters aimed at the local crime lord with overtones of a Guy
Ritchie crime racket (or throw backs to the director&#x27;s &#x27;Layer Cake&#x27;).
There is some brilliant black comedy but the main story is very dark
and sinister plot involving a crime gang (think Sin City and Watchmen).<br /><br />A multi-layered movie, the director of &#x27;Layer Cake&#x27; could well have
called it an &#x27;Upside Down Cake&#x27;. The super heroes have no super human
powers, the real super hero is 11 years old and female, most of the
characters have human weaknesses, the cake has some ridiculous looking
icing or frosting (music and comedy) and the identities of the heroes
becomes revealed to some of the players. Rather than depict super
heroes, we see the absurdity of becoming a vigilante to solve the
problems of crime. The problem won&#x27;t be fixed by &#x22;super power&#x22; miracles
nor will it be fixed with anarchy or vigilance. Our solution is
somewhere within the opposite polar views or within our parameters of
choice, but where?<br /><br />The main heroes are Big Daddy (and he was no &#x27;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&#x27;)
and his side kick daughter Hit Girl (and she&#x27;s no pop-star but a
hit-man assassin dressed like a &#x27;Little Miss Sunshine&#x27; and loaded with
a mouthful of clanger killer lines). Meanwhile the nerds are at work
discovering love in all the wrong places.<br /><br />Best part of the movie is the use of music (in totally inappropriate
ways): &#x27;The Barber of Seville Overture&#x27;, playtime was never so much fun
with &#x27;(Banana Splits) Tra La La Song&#x27;, Elivis singing Battle Hymn of
the Republic (Glory, glory, hallelujah) and &#x27;Crazy&#x27; boogied out in a
car seat on the way to a crime.<br /><br />It seemed to be mainly filmed in Toronto with scenes from New York to
make it look like NY, NY.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
