A spot on Film, 10 out of 10 - and it shows just how a superhero film
should be made.<br /><br />Just a great piece of film - witty, knowing, escapism with a great cast
and some greater direction.<br /><br />You like the main character, you&#x27;ll love Hit Girl and you&#x27;ll like Nic
Cage all over again. You&#x27;ll be glued to the screen from start to finish
and you don&#x27;t need 3D glasses strapped to your face to think you are
watching something special. After the let-down that was Avatar (all
flash and no substance) you&#x27;ll be chewing on Kick-Ass for days after
and remembering all the cool bits making it a defo for watching again -
and hope the sequel will be just as good.
