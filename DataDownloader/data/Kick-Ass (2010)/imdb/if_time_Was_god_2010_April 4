At the start it looked as though Kick-Ass was going to be a funny and
different film; it seemed like it would be a &#x22;realistic&#x22; superhero
movie with an interesting plot. However, although the &#x27;superhero&#x27;
(Kick-Ass) remained as a normal (although with lots of crazy things
happening to him) character living in New York, a lot of the other
characters- namely the two actual super heroes he meets- completely
change the film into an unrealistic, clich&#xE9;d American action film. <br /><br />The thing I did like about this film however was that it wasn&#x27;t afraid
to be offensive. There was lots of violence, swearing and completely
politically incorrect things that went on- which was all good! However,
it was spoiled by a completely predictable plot and the fact that the
director obviously didn&#x27;t really know what kind of film he wanted it to
be (realistic comedy or superhero movie). Also, the film at times
seemed to be just an advert for Myspace and Apple as the product
placement in it was just horrible! <br /><br />Kick-Ass did have it&#x27;s moments but it really didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s
hype for me- save your money for something else!
