Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s outlandish and somewhat squeamish 2010 film Kick-Ass
makes the grade for sheer energy and unabashed outlandishness, a
near-on two hour assault through all things in bad taste and devilishly
daring content, delivered through this somewhat perverse filter of dark
reds; purples; light greens accompanied by streaks of yellows as well
as coldly metallic whites blended with grey. The film isn&#x27;t so much
about the things that it wants to say as much as it is the way in which
it goes about saying them, something that dogs the film come the final
act but until then remains an unabashed and full on blackly comedic
onslaught of sadistic gangsters; disgruntled young men; elusive young
women; sickly amusing juxtapositions and a whole lot of off-the-cusp
content.<br /><br />Kick-Ass tells the tale of two males, one coming out of adolescence as
his high-school days fritter away and his life situation appears to get
worse by the day; the other a much older man, a discontent ex-cop whom
was wrongfully imprisoned and is now seeking revenge in the harsh,
unforgiving, intimidating basin that is modern day New York City. The
adolescent is David Lizewski (Johnson), a boy living with his father
following his mother&#x27;s passing, not in control of his hormones and
mostly living a self-identified pathetic existence consisting of being
rolled over by bullies; rejected by girls, particularly young Katie
(Fonseca), and mixing it with his teen-aged friends at internet caf&#xE9;s
and comic book shops. We observe him during a tracking shot down a
school corridor, in slow motion, which accentuates their
characteristics and place in life. They look around uneasily at their
surroundings, sport nervous smiles which feign confidence and look a
little weedy. His point of attack is generically reminiscent to that of
your more bog-standard high-school comedy, during which the presence of
Christopher Mintz-Plasse&#x27;s Chris D&#x27;Amico, son of a local mafia kingpin,
is encompassed with his own, more exquisite introduction seeing him
step out of a limousine: he&#x27;s been here before in 2007&#x27;s Superbad, and
consequently has his star-system reputation toyed with by the film as
being a veteran to all this content.<br /><br />David shares some duality with a certain Damon Macready, played by
Nicolas Cage. Macready cuts an odd figure, sporting prim glasses and a
tall figure; his big, bushy moustache standing him out amidst
proceedings as he encourages young daughter Mindy (Moretz) to learn the
art of hand to hand combat via gunshots to well protected chests; pop
quizzes on heavy artillery and lessons in using knifes. She goes on to
become the purple-haired; skirt wearing; ninja weapon wielding
Hit-Girl, one of the more eye-opening characters from a film from
recent years. Both men fight a system, a large governing body of people
too corrupt to especially care for the results of their actions, the
system failing to clean up the neighbourhood which Dave inhabits, as
well as incorrectly sentencing MacReady to a stretch in prison. When we
discover what it is Macready is fighting for, in an affecting scene,
Vaughn constructs a particular character&#x27;s epiphany in discovering the
true extent to what happened as if inadvertently uncovering a serial
killer&#x27;s lair, complete with mandatory diary full of disdain and
hatred, and the desired reaction is accomplished.<br /><br />The nature of Dave&#x27;s existence pushes him to order a costume over the
Internet so as to enable him to go out and test a thesis he himself
concocted more broadly linked to that of why it is super-heroes do not
exist. The anger, dishevelment and frustrations born out of the hand
life has dealt young Dave sees him long to escape such a persona, or
existence, and venture out into another one: one is toothless and
somewhat of a target to those whom prey; the other, complete with
costume, a mysterious, overly bold, anonymous and quite violent
creation born out of his situation in life. We feel Dave is at rock
bottom and when he&#x27;s on the roof top of a five story building
practising leaping from top-to-top, before urgently pulling out of the
final jump, we do still feel that that&#x27;s a suicide attempt which
doesn&#x27;t materialise more than a potential vigilante practising
super-heroism. Eventually, his popularity with the public sees his fame
sky-rocket; his first taste at super-heroism sees him fail overall but
his actions get him closer to Katie, so he continues.<br /><br />Later on, their framework encompasses the realising of the importance
of sticking to one&#x27;s true identity; Dave coming to reject his online,
super-hero, &#x27;fake&#x27; persona as Katie herself realises the shallowness of
her own attitudes in initially deducing Dave to be &#x27;of an ilk&#x27;, before
coming round to seeing what sort of guy he is after naturally bonding
with him. The argument that it is a character piece and not an
adolescent display of gratuity continues when we recall the early, slow
track of Dave-plus-friends and match that up beside and a later
composition of Dave looking beaten; bloodied; grubbier and less than
smart following the plodding through his dangerous misadventure.<br /><br />Vaughn&#x27;s film is a delicate balance of coming of age with the tale of
full on revenge against a system, but to say it goes about exploring
its themes, ideas and stories in a delicate manner would be wholly
misleading; the film a jaunty and engrossing enough action/comedy
tackling notions of one&#x27;s identity in a contemporary, digitally driven
universe and encompassing a fair deal of characterisation in the
process, resulting in a film not really as substantial nor as
adventurous as either of Vaughn&#x27;s previous two pieces, but regardless
something with the ability to stand on its own. He keeps both strands
moving along at equal pace, Cage&#x27;s is more engrossing; the film paying
sly hint to knowing so when it utilises the concoction of Hit-Girl to
drive the film&#x27;s final act on behalf of Cage&#x27;s plight. Moral panics and
general outrage aside, Kick-Ass is an engrossing and substantial enough
film to get involved in.
