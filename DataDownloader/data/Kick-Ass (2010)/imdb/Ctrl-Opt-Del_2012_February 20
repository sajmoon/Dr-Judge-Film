Kick-Ass may not be the best superhero movie ever made, but it does
have one quality that sets it apart from all others. There have been so
very many superhero origin movies, but most are set in comic book
universes where superheroism is already known, and so the emergent
protagonists are treated as merely the new kid on the block. In
Kick-Ass we get to see the actual emergence of the first ever
superheros, and the inevitable surprised and - at first - incredulous
attitude of both the general populace and the &#x22;bad guys&#x22;.<br /><br />This, for me, makes Kick-Ass probably the most original handing of
superhero lore that has ever been presented.
