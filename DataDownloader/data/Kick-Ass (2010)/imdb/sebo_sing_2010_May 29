When a friend called me on a wet, cold, rainy day to watch this movie
&#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;, my first reaction was slightly hesitant. The reason being
that the only information in which I had heard about this film was that
it was a comedic superhero medium film with this &#x22;new teenage awkward
nerdy character being the protagonist&#x22;, in which yes is funny but I
believe this type of film could be wearing a bit thin in my taste. My
preconceived notion that I was preparing myself to sit through two
hours of Seth Rogan puffing and yelling in amazement that he got out of
a some ridiculous situation somehow and talking in his blunt humorous
voice to some sort of funny secondary character, or Michael Cera
talking awkwardly to some unbelievable good looking American teenage
girl. The movie would be funny yes, but I wasn&#x27;t in the mood, as I had
kind of already seen this movie in my mind, if you know what I mean.
But how wrong I was. <br /><br />Enough of my story, the movie started and the narration by the
protagonist clearly showed that the writer knew his/hers comic books,
not that I know a whole lot but enough to understand this movie will
create a fine comic movie, as it is a hard thing to do and there are
various ways in which to attack this genre (also that Rogan and Cera
were not casted). And I was right as the movie provided iconic
references and provides us with a new feel to the comic book stories.
The story line is quite simple but retains originality; nerd kid wants
to be superhero but is falling and eventually succeeds, ruthless drug
dealer villains whom which a man on a quest of revenge with his
daughter and is all combined quite well. At the beginning of the movie
the comedy of the teenage nerd and his friends was fairly prominent and
I thought that this would be the extent of the film. The usual
predictable things were happening, e.g., glorifying that dressing up as
a hero is idiotic and we laugh at this boy trying to become a
superhero, etc. For me so far the movie was OK to watch, but as soon as
the protagonist attempts to stop a carjacking and is actually brutally
stabbed in the stomach, the movie turned and started to become a real
comic book action movie started to emerge as we met other vigilantes,
Nick cage (this role was probably his dream role and provided a great
performance) and his daughter and their very exaggerated was of
killing, moving, planning and access to resources, which we all love in
the fantasy world of superhero stories. Other great aspects that
indulge us into the comic book world such as long shots of New York,
the media&#x27;s reaction to these heroes, explanation of subplot and some
of the cinematography looked like we were watching Batman. <br /><br />I will try not to reveal any more about the plot of this dark comedy in
which I originally thought will be a &#x22;Judd Apatow&#x22; comedy. The
characters and their stories play an integral role into which why we
laugh or do not turn away as the absolute brutal violence is thrown in
front of us. It may be the &#x22;cool&#x22; feeling we receive with the &#x22;cool&#x22;
weaponry (strobe light gun), the secondary characters providing as good
comedic reliefs, or just the director manages to let us actually go
into the world of comics, (where the exaggerated violence is
acceptable) as the violence might even go past the movies limits but no
one would ever feel it. Maybe all three? Either way the film is a
brilliant dark comedy in my opinion, as at times I even forgot it was a
comedy and felt quite tense. I still prefer my serious superhero movies
and my Coen Bros dark comedies, but in terms of if you&#x27;re looking for
something a little more whacking, having a few more laughs and some
really, really cool, action scenes and soundtrack (Titoli- Ennio
Morricone, (A Few Dollars More) caused me to sit up in excitement as
the 11 year old girl guns her way through some expendable villains),
this movie you will enjoy immensely. <br /><br />8.5/10
