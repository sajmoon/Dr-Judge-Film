How I would&#x27;ve loved to entitle this review &#x22;Kick-Ass!&#x22; (get the double
meaning), because it was! It was truly unique and lived beyond my
expectations. It just had something of everything. In a nutshell -
revolutionary.<br /><br />Unfortunately this title is already consuming reviews in many variants.
And though it&#x27;s highly appropriate and a little contagious, it&#x27;s just
too easy to do. I&#x27;m fresh out of cinema, just having seen it in
advanced screening. It was so good I&#x27;m still buzzing. I couldn&#x27;t stop
rambling about it to the friend I went to see it with, I enjoyed it so
much. And by the way he wasn&#x27;t able to stop talking about it either I
guess he did too. I just had to review it! I&#x27;ve never read the comic by
Mark Millar, I&#x27;m not really much of a comic book fan. However, I love a
good movie. Having seen a trailer, I instantly thought this looked
different to most of its genre. After seeing more trailers, it became
one of my addictions. My interest keened on it. So I booked tickets as
soon as I could and went to watch Kick-Ass.<br /><br />Enough of my autobiographical account of my run up to seeing the movie.
Here&#x27;s some of the things you can expect...<br /><br />Storywise Kick-Ass is quite simple. It brings us into the world of Dave
Lizewski, a high school student and comic book nerd who yearns to
become a real-life superhero. Not through some life changing event,
neither through any actual superpowers. So he does. Despite parodying
many, many superheroes who are referenced in the film (mainly by the
protagonist himself (fittingly!)). It oddly retains a comic-book feel
in structure from start to finish. Going as far as to use comic book
captions throughout the film.<br /><br />I&#x27;d say that Kick-Ass is in one sense a teen film. Not a cheesy one
though. It carries the whole feeling of typical teenage life at that
age in the film. The desire to act irresponsibly, sexual curiosity,
immature jokes and social cliques. They all feature. At the same time
Kick-Ass has some surprisingly mature and realistic themes and moral
questions.<br /><br />Now in other senses Kick-Ass is an action-comedy with hints of thriller
and western. And it doesn&#x27;t lay up on the action or comedy. Action is
intense and brutal and often you can almost feel the hurt of the
heroes. Comedy is top notch and should have you laughing at some
daringly placed jokes. Or laughing inside at the nerdy/immature jokes.
Use of some well known songs and movie themes at best-placed moments
amplify Kick-Ass greatly. And though you&#x27;ll most likely guess what&#x27;s
coming next, (some parts still come as a surprise) it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s
told that keeps you involved and loving it. My friend bought a large
cup on Coke for the movie. He confessed afterwards that he was so taken
in by the movie he&#x27;d completely forgotten about it! <br /><br />I struggle not to give this a 10, which is a pity. It&#x27;s so close but I
believe firmly that there&#x27;ll never be a perfect movie. Why is it a pity
exactly? I saw Avatar at the end of last year. As Christmas drew close.
I loved it and wrote a review, giving it a 9/10. But Avatar only just
scraped a 9/10 in my mind. Kick-Ass was so much better. So there&#x27;s my
verdict! Go grab tickets and enjoy this stand-out movie while it&#x27;s
still in cinemas.<br /><br />***Final Notes*** Though I guess some people may say this movie is
ripping off Watchmen, they&#x27;d be very wrong. Though it has some basis in
it, Watchmen was a very serious look at the idea of real-life
superheroes. Kick-Ass is a lot more comical look at it. Detailing a
world where the main character and others are very aware of the
superheroes these vigilantes have based themselves off. Plus Dave
Lizewski decides to become &#x22;the wetsuit crusader&#x22; because he wonders
why no one else has tried something similar. Not because he&#x27;s a
psychopath.
