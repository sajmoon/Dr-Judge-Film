I have to admit, I&#x27;m not a big fan of superhero films. But recent ones
such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight have stood out to me and I have
loved them. Kick-Ass is no different.<br /><br />Kick-Ass skillfully combines audiences&#x27; love of comic books, movies and
action to churn out the opposite of what you&#x27;d expect from a superhero
movie. Although it has its serious moments, Kick-Ass has a mostly
humorous and satirical edge to it, with well-choreographed action
thrown into the mixture.<br /><br />Although the movie as a whole is stunning, there are many things that
stand out. One of these things is the acting, particularly young Chloe
Moretz, who plays Mindy Mcready/Hit Girl. Kick-Ass does mot aim to be
politically correct; Mindy is not your average pre-teen. As famed
critic Roger Ebert put it, the role of Mindy is &#x22;morally
reprehensible,&#x22; and you can&#x27;t disagree. Mindy dishes out a lot of the
carnage in the film and uses language you may not expect from a
stereotypical eleven year old girl. Most people who aren&#x27;t nit-picky
will realize that these things improve the entertainment factor and
deliver an extreme use of shock tactics and will love Mindy&#x27;s
seriousness. I certainly did.<br /><br />Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also excellent in the role of Red Mist, the
nerdy, yet evil superhero son of baddie Frank D&#x27;Amico.<br /><br />Thanks to these superb performances, direction under Matthew Vaughn, an
amazing script and lovable characters it was inevitable that I would
love this movie. If you&#x27;re someone who is skeptical about the moral
reprehensibility of the film, watch the red band trailer first. But if
you enjoy an entertaining, well-written movie, then Kick-Ass is a must
see film. Definitely the best film of 2010 so far Great screenplay +
superb acting + amazing directing + a great storyline = brilliant,
entertaining movie.<br /><br />100% Absolutely Stunning, Must-See 10/10
