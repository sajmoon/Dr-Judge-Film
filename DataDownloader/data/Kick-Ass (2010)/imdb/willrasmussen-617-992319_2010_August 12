When I first saw Kick Ass i was expecting more action than comedy.
However, I was wrong with how surprisingly funny the movie turned out
to be. I thought Hit Girl was what made the movie shine as she was
cussing and slaughtering people. Aaron Johnson did a good job playing
the lead role of Kick Ass and I thought Nicolas Cage was good at
playing Big Daddy as it wasn&#x27;t the typical Cage film. This movie beats
a lot of those stupid high school movies and chick flicks that are
trying to be funny but fail. This is a great combination of bloody
action and comedy. Its the Super Bad meets Kill Bill genre. I highly
recommend this film.
