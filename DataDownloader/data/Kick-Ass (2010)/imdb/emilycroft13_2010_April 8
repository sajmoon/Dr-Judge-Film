I went to see this purely on the basis of the current high ratings of
it on IMDb. This is a very funny film, even though I&#x27;m not personally
into comics and heros. <br /><br />Plot is very simple with some surreal and hilarious violence that all
add to the humour. Nicolas Cage is fantastic as always in my books, and
new comer Aaron Johnson was excellent also. If you fancy seeing a funny
film you must check this out, awesome film and thats coming from a
girl.<br /><br />This film also has a pretty good soundtrack, especially the superhero&#x27;s
&#x27;theme music&#x27;.
