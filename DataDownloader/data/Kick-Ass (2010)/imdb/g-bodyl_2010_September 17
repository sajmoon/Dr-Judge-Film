I can&#x27;t describe beyond words on how awesome this movie is. I waited
for the DVD with the thought that this movie would not be good enough
to see in theatres. I wish I saw this in theatres because this is one
of the best movies I have ever seen. There is a good blend of comedy,
action, and teen romance.<br /><br />This is about a teenage superhero who teams up with a adult superhero
and his young daughter and together they fight the evil off in New York
City.<br /><br />Now if you are expecting something like Batman or Superman, you will be
wrong. These superheroes fight to kill unlike the fore-mentioned
superheroes. This movie depicts tons of violence especially from the
amazing 11-year old girl. But, I liked that.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best superhero movies ever. The only thing
I hated was Nic Cage&#x27;s haircut. I rate this film 10/10.
