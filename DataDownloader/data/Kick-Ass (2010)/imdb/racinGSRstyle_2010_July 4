7.9/10 Kick-Ass is a really good movie, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But it&#x27;s
fatal flaw, if you can call it that, is the ending. By the time the
3rd(?) big fight rolls around, you&#x27;re past the best part of the movie
and moving into post-The Matrix slow motion acrobatics meets gun
fighting meets karate we&#x27;ve all seen several times before. All of the
story has come to pass and all that is left is ridiculous and very
comic book-like violence. This is not a bad thing, and the movie IS
based on a comic book after all, but I really felt like the movie was
SO good up until that point that the rest was just more of the same
action we&#x27;d already experienced throughout the film while being bereft
of anything compelling or new, and was something of a let down.<br /><br />This is definitely a great movie overall. If the final I dunno 20-30
minutes or whatever had been better this would deserve the place it
currently holds in the top 250. As it stands this is a movie that
pretty much everyone should see, and you could do A LOT worse.
