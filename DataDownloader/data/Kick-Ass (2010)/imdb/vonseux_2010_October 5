this movie has more free-violence than any war movie I call recall, and
it&#x27;s done by an cold blooded 11 year old. Also, the only superhero
movie where the GOOD guys are more perverse than the actual bad guys. I
know this is based on a comic book, but i&#x27;ll wont bother to read it, i
doubt it covers all the plot holes. Did i&#x27;ve said that the 11 murderer
kills people who are already down? Or what about the super-smart Big
Daddy making idiot moves when the bad written plot demands? The
characters have no life, the only reason to be there is to make pure,
cold violence. I had to stop the movie several times, thinking why i&#x27;m
still watching this? DAMM WATCHMEN was violent too, but it gave a hard
atmosphere and background. It shows how to make a &#x27;real life&#x27;
superheroes thing. Kick-ass, in it&#x27;s colour dandy world, only shows how
it is cool to kill people with cool moves, and dropping blood on the
screen is cool too. So kids, go buy a comic and learn how to Kill
people. There&#x27;s even a scene where the camera go on First Person
mode... like an video game! Don&#x27;t let your kids wacth this. Or anyone
you care about
