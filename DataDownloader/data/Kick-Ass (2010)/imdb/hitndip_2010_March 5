Saw it yesterday from a movie screening. This movie has it all, comedy,
action, and story. I recommend this movie to everyone who has a sense
of humor. best thing of all nothing in this movie was over
exaggerating. The fighting scenes were well done and the actors were
very good. If your into superhero movies and want to check something
new out. this is it. The story alone makes the movie all that much
better. A lot of action movies either have to much action and not a
good story or very little action and a good story. Kick Ass has both
the action and the great story. I mean common who hasn&#x27;t dreamed of
being a super hero and fighting bad guys. If you liked the comedy in
Superbad, you will love Kick Ass.
