Kick-Ass is one of the most original films to come out in years,
particularly in the superhero genre. Forget Batman, Spiderman and
Superman. Kick-Ass is the new hero in cinema. Aaron Johnson played
nerdy Dave desperate to be a superhero though he has no ounce of powers
and is just a normal fifteen year old as he asks how far would go to
protect someone you don&#x27;t know being hurt? Would you stop to help them
or just look the other way? He&#x27;s also longing for a beautiful girl in
school called Kate. He teams up with Hit-Girl, a very cool and superbly
acted part played by Chloe Moretz and Big Dadddy, Nicolas Cage
(seriously) dressed up like Batman with the exact replica voice of Adam
West to take down a drug lord played excellently by Mark Strong who
also has a son who dresses up as a hero calling himself Red Mist.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz steals the show in my opinion as she is the one who truly
kicks ass, taught by her dad to shoot, fight and kill with swords
(grown up men!) This is a fantastic film that takes you by the balls
and takes you on a roller-coaster ride of your life. All expectations
of what you think this film will be like is thrown out of the window.
With a superb script and acting. (Nicolas Cage being back on form after
his less than average performances of recent). Kick-Ass is so
outrageously daft in a brilliant way making it deliciously daring and
absolutely hilarious and it dosen&#x27;t pretend to be otherwise as it makes
great fun of itself. The action sequences are also crafted with an
expert eye. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It&#x27;s that amazingly
done. But be warned though it is funny it&#x27;s also extremely crude and
violent so if you don&#x27;t like guts steer clear.<br /><br />The movie is intelligent in my opinion with such originality and
daftness. Kids becoming superheroes with no powers! I absolutely loved
it and Matthew Vaughn knows how to keep the pace of the film going, not
by endless expanded scenes but keeping the characters moving and
transitioning the film from romance to action to comedy and drama
ceaselessly which is no easy task. There is the definite possibility of
a sequel on it&#x27;s way. If you haven&#x27;t seen this yet, what are you
waiting for? GO!
