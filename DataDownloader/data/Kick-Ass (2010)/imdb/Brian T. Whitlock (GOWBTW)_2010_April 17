Need of escape of the real world? Try comic books. Need of a local
super hero? Count on Kick-Ass! Here you have a teen named Dave Lizweski
(Aaron Johnson), quiet, awkward, invisible to girls who has an
obsession with comic books. He lives with his father, after his mother
died at the breakfast table, he descends into total silence with
himself. It took some reading of comic books which would make him
something interesting; a superhero. But his friends thinks he&#x27;s out
there. Maybe. But one day when he and his pal get robbed, Dave goes
into this mode that changes his persona for the better of mankind:
Kick-Ass. When he meets the same thugs, he gets attack and stabbed. The
second time, he becomes a sensation of New York. After that, he
inspires more people to become a superhero. A father(Nicholas Cage) and
his daughter become HitGirl and Big Daddy. Hit Girl was total bad. She
kills without remorse and so does her sidekick father. The result of
that; police corruption that lead to his wife&#x27;s death, and his
imprisonment by a corrupt detective(Xander Berkley). When the heroes
collide against the thugs, it&#x27;s a blood fest waiting to happen. This
movie has plenty of action, plenty of comedy, and plenty of crudeness
which is not surprising. If you want to live your inner hero, check out
Kick-Ass!! 5 stars!
