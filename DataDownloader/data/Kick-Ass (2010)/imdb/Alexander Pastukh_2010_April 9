I&#x27;ve been lucky to see that movie yesterday on the special showing at
the biggest Moscow theater before the official Russian release date.
Though I&#x27;m not a real admirer of the films based on comic books due to
it&#x27;s tend to be boring and silly, there are some good pictures in that
vein which I find rather good. For instance &#x27;&#x27;Iron Man&#x27;&#x27; or &#x27;&#x27;Dark
Knight&#x27;&#x27;. This time my scrupulous attention was attracted by the matter
of fact that it&#x27;s a kinda parody movie. I&#x27;m saying &#x27;&#x27;kinda&#x27;&#x27; because
&#x27;&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27;&#x27; is also based on the comic book, but this book in
comparing with others is fairly untypical mainly for the specific
approaching to superhero idea and a comedy script. Seen references in
press and comments of other people were quite good therefore I couldn&#x27;t
avoid the opportunity to see it.<br /><br />Have you ever dreamed to become a superhero in your childhood? I guess
you did. But now try to remember what had always stopped you? Yes
right! Even in our childhood we had a perception that in real life we
will definitely be beaten, that somebody will obviously kick our ass.
Dave Lizewski is the same guy with the same dreams, but the difference
is that he attempted to make his dream come true. He bought a superhero
costume in the internet shop and went out on the streets to struggle
against a crime and establish the justice. Of course No wonder he&#x27;s got
clobbered twice, but despite of it he has rapidly become a famous star.
Just because of his non-careless attitude.<br /><br />&#x27;&#x27;I don&#x27;t wanna be involved&#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;Why should I help someone?&#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;It&#x27;s
not my problem&#x27;&#x27; that&#x27;s what constantly people thinking while
somebody&#x27;s in danger. And when they are eventually finding themselves
in a tight corner, they start to complain of no one didn&#x27;t try to help
them. It&#x27;s a deep and serious society problem, nobody cares &#x27;bout each
other issues, usually people even afraid to call the police. And even
though this is a comedy &#x27;&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27;&#x27; tries to awake feeling that you
always have a capacity to help, that you shouldn&#x27;t keep yourself aloof
from the real problems.<br /><br />But it was a lyrical digression. Of course this movie should be
considered as funny comedy which parodies comic movies. Matthew Vaughn
had satisfied almost all spectators&#x27; demands. Perpetual jokes
permanently fuels during entire film, I was literally writhing in
hysterics while watching it. Clumsy hero in stupid hydro costume,
idiotic tandem of Nicholas Cage (who parodied the Batman) and his
little daughter, stupid mafia made me laughing all the time. Definitely
this is the funniest film of this year. Elaborately madden action
scenes delighting eyes, since &#x27;&#x27;Kill Bill&#x27;&#x27; I don&#x27;t remember so brutal,
cruel with lotta blood and violence film. Another one good side is that
&#x27;&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27;&#x27; ain&#x27;t overextended like the most of such movies, it isn&#x27;t
become annoying in the middle.<br /><br />No doubt this is amazing stuff to spend vacations or after working
evening greatly. The only one minus is that for obvious reasons you
cannot take your children (if you have them) on this film. Rest of all
is great, if you have an opportunity to see it, don&#x27;t hesitate!
