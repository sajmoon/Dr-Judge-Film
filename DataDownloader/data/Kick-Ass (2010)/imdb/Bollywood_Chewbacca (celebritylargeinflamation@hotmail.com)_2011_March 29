Beats me... &#x22;the wittier and more intelligent British comedy in years&#x22;
what was the DVD&#x27;s cover said... Ha, ha! I fell for it...<br /><br />This film is absolute crap and I don&#x27;t recommend to watch it, not even
to my worst enemy (I hope he saw it, though)... please, if you haven&#x27;t
seen it, stay away from this ****, you will thank me...<br /><br />Bad acting, worse lines, stupid plot (was there a plot?), I&#x27;m aware
this **** was a parody but come on, there was no irony, humor,
witticism, nothing which could save this stupid movie...<br /><br />Believe it or not, I felt so dirty after watching this poor excuse of a
film that I had to bathe myself after the end...I promise, I won&#x27;t see
a British so called comedy again, ever...<br /><br />I feel sorry, sad and pathetic for wasting that time watching this ****
(do you see a pattern? about the grayed four letters word? Well, that
is because Kick-Ass is, a total, complete ****)
