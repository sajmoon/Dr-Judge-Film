Can someone let me know if this movie would be enjoyable to a person
over age 30? I have yet to watch this film but have had it on BluRay
for a long time. I got it for my kids. It seems to me that folks older
that 25 may not like it? I am well over 40. This is an odd question I
know but it is hard to watch all of the films that use such young
people to portray characters with such deep well developed ideas and
problems. There is nothing that shocks or upsets me but I seem to get
frustrated watching 14 yr old people talk about all the sexual and
money and life problems they are having and it just seems to be to
unreal to watch, of course I realize that this film is a fantasy. I am
not old just curious if other people have this same problem with a lot
of newer movies? I do understand that the main audiences of these
movies are younger folks but they have no life experiences yet. I also
know that most reviews of movies on this site are from folks younger
than 25. I have no problem with that it just makes one cringe when a 20
yr old person has such deep life traumas because it just does not
happen that way. I know this review will get a lot of nasty comments,
but I have nothing bad to say just want to know what others feel?
Thanks... Cheeseman
