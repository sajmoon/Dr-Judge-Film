Kick Ass is a superhero movie, and while it offers a satirical first
act of what a superhero is, it rolls out as a true action movie by the
time your watching the opening credits.<br /><br />That being said, you haven&#x27;t seen this movie before. The situations are
going to seem familiar, but the character are all brand new, especially
the little 11 year old that takes the spotlight, Hit Girl brings in
what I would like to guess is the next big Character Archetype. Now
you&#x27;ve had little girls, and you&#x27;ve had bad ass little girls, Hit Girl
fits into Bad ass little girl, but way different than before. She says
a few bad words at the start, but it seems like that quickly dies out
before the opening. What is not changed is that she is in the scenes
were the most gratuitous violence is depicted and she is almost always
the one committing gratuitous violence.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage works surprisingly perfect as a satire of Batman, and he
ties in what unfortunately is probably a largely missed joke. Not going
to spoil it here though.<br /><br />Ultimately, it sets off as a spoof, and works its way backwards into
being one of the most awesome movies you&#x27;re likely to see this year,
and definitely the best so far this year.<br /><br />9/10
