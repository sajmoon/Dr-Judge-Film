2010_March 28 
When I first heard of this film, late last year, I was intrigued. I
watched some trailers and thought this could be, potentially, the film
of 2010. Well, it&#x27;ll take something special for this not to be the case
as Kick-Ass certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.<br /><br />Nic Cage was great, his &#x22;acting&#x22; style was well suited to the role of
Big Daddy, as were the rest of the cast. But it&#x27;s Chloe Moretz who
steals the show. Hit Girl swears, not as much as some who haven&#x27;t seen
the film seem to think, and kills her way through the film as is
awesome. Arnie, Sly, Dolph, Bruce, Chan and Statham all rolled into a
pint sized assassin. She&#x27;ll go far I&#x27;m sure.<br /><br />I may have to go see this again later this week. <br /><br />9/10. Can&#x27;t wait for the Blu Ray.
