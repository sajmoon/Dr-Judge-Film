Before I go on I would formally like to thank the Brendan Theatre in
Las Vegas for hosting a screening of this film.<br /><br />When seeing this over spring break I was surprised how badly this film
played to me. I&#x27;m the main demographic it&#x27;s aimed at (under 25 male)
and despite that everyone else at the screening really seemed to enjoy
it. I wouldn&#x27;t have written anything about except the general theme of
reviews seems to be that this is Pulp Fiction meets Spiderman.<br /><br />The story starts off with a voice-over narration of Dave Lizewski
(Aaron Johnson) as the overlooked high-schooler who decides that
becoming a superhero in this day and age can be achieved. He dons the
suit and mask of Kick-Ass and the story goes on. The idea that the
premise of Kick-Ass has been done is seemingly lost on director Matthew
Vaughn (Layer Cake &#x26; Stardust) and he plows ahead acting as if Batman
Begins and Spiderman don&#x27;t exist in the American lexicon. Unfortunately
for Kick-Ass he discovers that he isn&#x27;t even the most qualified
vigilante on the streets and is soon outshined by the foul-mouthed and
probably deranged Hit-Girl (Chloe Moritz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage
doing his best Adam West impersonation). Red Mist also makes an
appearance (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) but he&#x27;s definitely not my cup of
tea - in any of his roles.<br /><br />The violence is controversial just for its own sake really. Hit-Girl
(Chloe Moritz) the fan favorite of the audience ends up in a bad way
that is really just to gruesome to watch. If you watched No Country for
Old Men and thought, &#x22;Why is this Anton Chigurh guy such a choir boy?
He should act with some malice!&#x22; then this might be your movie. Anyone
else however will probably be disgusted.<br /><br />But there is one thing I have to say going for it: Aaron Johnson. If I
didn&#x27;t know any better I would say they have found the new Peter Parker
for the Marc Webb reboot of Spiderman. Of course now it is unlikely
with Sony presumably going for an unknown for the role. Johnson outdoes
everyone else in the film and he is easily the most relatable.<br /><br />Again I don&#x27;t hate this film (violence against children aside), but it
just doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything going for it.<br /><br />http://nevermindpopfilm.blogspot.com
