2010_April 16 
Don&#x27;t believe the rating of this movie &#x96; at least take it with a grain
of salt. As many, I like to check ratings of movies before I go.
Kick-Ass opened today (April 16, 2010), and it already has 7,900 votes.
Yes, I understand that it may have opened in some markets early. While
it may be an 8.5 star movie, I am wondering if the box has not been
stuffed. What concerns me is that while females in the range 18-29 gave
it an 8.5, and females 45+ gave it 8.0, I note that females under 18
gave it a 5.2, and females 30-44 gave it a 5.8. Maybe whoever was
stuffing the box was trying to add &#x22;random&#x22; high and low stars, this is
just statistically not plausible. Sure, there may be this kind of range
from young to old, but I repeat, here the inner age group, 30-44 gave
it 5.8, the shouldering age groups both gave it better than 8!
Something is very fishy here.<br /><br />Granted, this may be all legit, some statistical anomaly, but? And, or
course, on reading this, maybe future ballot stuffers will be more
adept. Then how are we to know? Not sure how the IMDb staff can prevent
this. Whew (Still, looks cool, gonna go out and see it tonight!)
