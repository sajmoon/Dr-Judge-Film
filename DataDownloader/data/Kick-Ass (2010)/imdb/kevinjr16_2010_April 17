This movie is very very good. I&#x27;m not going to go into why just know
that its better than the dark knight. The real reason im on here is to
counteract the lame crybabies. (roger ebert im talking about you.) Yes
the violence isover the top. But this is a masterful movie and at the
center of it shines hit girl. This movie isn&#x27;t really about kick ass at
all. Its about the story of big daddy and hit girl&#x27;s revenge. Its a
gripping tale that can only be achieved by extreme violence as the bad
guys here are truly bad. People are way too used to the lame comic book
bad guys that stand around and chat away giving the hero time to foil
their plans. Not these guys. They don&#x27;t f**k around. They will shoot
you in the face and laugh about the way your head exploded. So to take
them down calls for extreme measures. All i can say is grow the f**k up
people and grow some balls. This movie works on every level.
