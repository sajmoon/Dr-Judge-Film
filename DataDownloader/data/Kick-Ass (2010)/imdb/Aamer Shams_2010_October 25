Must say, been a while since I last saw an action movie so well put
together. The action sequences, the music, the CG all fits in just
right. Direction and Production was amazing, and I think they got the
name of the movie from the acting skills of these kids....which indeed
is Kick-Ass.<br /><br />However, I do have a small concern and I don&#x27;t think I will be the only
one; do we really need to put bring violence of such extremes to the
age group portrayed in the movie? Don&#x27;t we already have enough violence
and unrest among the new generation? Other than that, not a kiddie
movie at all; but then again for grown ups....a KICK-ASS action movie!
