I guess I am just a sucker for those movies where the underdog
overcomes prejudice, ridicule and overwhelming odds to win respect,
impose justice or just get the cute girl. Whether it&#x27;s a 40-year old
virgin, a high school geek or the unlikely employee of the month, I get
vicarious joy from watching the small (or goofy) guy win. But with Kick
Ass, Hollywood has a number of surprises for you. Who would of thought
a prepubescent, 11-year old girl could embody all hopes and aspirations
of us armchair superhero lovers. Who thinks this stuff up? The running
jump shot to the head under strobe light has to be one of the finest
cinemagraphic effects I&#x27;ve seen in years. The music is great and well
chosen for each scene. I think you&#x27;ll really enjoy this one. But moms,
don&#x27;t rent this one for your tweens. The language is very adult.
