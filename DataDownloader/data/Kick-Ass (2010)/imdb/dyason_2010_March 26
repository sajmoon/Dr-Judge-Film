I&#x27;d seen the trailers to this film and they didn&#x27;t give much away. If
you&#x27;ve ever thought you could be a superhero then this is the film for
you. The fantastic mix of comedy, emotion, parody and sheer downright
awesomeness make this a film not to be missed.<br /><br />While high in comedy and creating some moments where I was doubled over
while watching it the film doesn&#x27;t pass up on scenes that draw you into
the characters either. Sometimes the things you&#x27;re laughing at are
because if you didn&#x27;t you&#x27;d cry. There&#x27;s a dark gritty story behind the
humour that can live up to Sin City, it&#x27;s just put across in a
different manner. As with all comic book superheros this one delivers
the drama and background that make the heroics themselves just another
part of fleshing out the individuals.<br /><br />The only way people could possibly pick fault with this film is with
the language and gratuitous violence, but it fits in so well and makes
the picture better for it. This picture deserves to become a cult
classic and I know I&#x27;ll be buying it as soon as it&#x27;s out.
