2010_April 8 
Before stepping into the auditorium of Kick-Ass i had heard many good
things but was not expecting it to live up to the media hype.<br /><br />For the first half of the movie, even though i new i was watching a
good film, i was left wondering where the media and fan based hype had
come from as i thought Aaron Johnson&#x27;s acting was less than an average
performance and couldn&#x27;t see how the story line would pick up without
falling into the typical super hero formula which we have seen so often
from films such as spider man and the fantastic four.<br /><br />However by the time i had left the cinema it was a different story.
this film had brought a huge smile to my face for many reasons; the way
comedy and action are fused together in an un-cheesy way which allows
you to appreciate both, how a thirteen year old girl has been allowed
to create so much gore, hoe it had left me and my friend so charmed and
also for it being a movie in which Nicolas Cage isn&#x27;t a terrible
actor...for once!<br /><br />I urge you to watch this film as it easily made its way into my top 3
movies of 2010 so far which includes Hurt Locker, Shutter Island and
now Kick-Ass.
