2010_June 13 
I heard about this film from my friend, and from what he told me and
from the little I knew beforehand about the film, this is the picture I
got:<br /><br />It would be a quite ordinary Hollywood film. Just another teen-comedy
with some under-the-belt humor and some mediocre acting. Predictable,
of course, perhaps tedious, and absolutely without a message or any
depth.<br /><br />I figured I&#x27;d just watch it to pass some time, perhaps have a laugh or
two, and if I got lucky; see some watch-worthy fight scenes. Now I can
not begin to describe how entirely blown out of my seat I was. I had
never expected any of what Kick-Ass was.<br /><br />With perfect pacing I was taken on a journey through really great
scenes, nice cinematography, good acting, funny and refreshing dialog
and _story_. Yes, above all story. I never would have thought this
movie would have any sort of profound story, but oh man was I wrong. I
started realizing, a bit into it, that this movie actually had story;
that it had meaning. There was a background, a motivation for
everything that happened. This movie was thought through.<br /><br />Then I was blown away again when Nicolas Cage popped up in the movie. I
had no idea he was in it, and his role and his acting it just brought
some... magnitude to the movie.<br /><br />Then I was blown away AGAIN when the &#x22;gore&#x22; scenes made their entrance.
I sure didn&#x27;t see that coming. It elevated the movie to a whole nother
level.<br /><br />Then there I sat; shocked, thrilled, mesmerized. And I enjoyed my way
through the movie as the story unfolded and took turns, as pleasant and
thrilling, interesting or funny scene after scene rolled by.<br /><br />And at the end of the movie, as the credits started rolling, and as I
started coming back to planet earth. And all that had happened was run
through my head, I just thought: &#x22;Man! What an experience!&#x22;<br /><br />That&#x27;s what it was: it truly was an experience. And what still puzzles
me... what I still can&#x27;t really grasp, is this:<br /><br />This is a really light-weight movie - with a profound depth.<br /><br />Cause it truly is light-weight. This is no Schindler&#x27;s List or Requiem
for a Dream or any other movie that puts you out of phase and forces
you to contemplate for a moment before you get back to reality. <br /><br />Still, at different points in this movie, some scenes, some lines, I
was as deeply touched and emotionally engaged as I was during great
films such as The Shawshank Redemption. And that just puzzles me... how
can this, quite simple movie, have such an effect, such an impact?<br /><br />I guess that&#x27;s just what you call great film-making. <br /><br />And for this, Kick-Ass earns a 10 from me. For it&#x27;s sheer effect. The
surprise, followed by the enthrallment that ended in stupefied
delightfulness.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who made this movie happen! Go see it !<br /><br />Peace.
