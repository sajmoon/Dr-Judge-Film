I have seen my share of superhero movies, and while most are pretty
good, they all follow the same storyline. You know, the one where
something happens to them physically/mentally to make them the way they
are, but with Kick-Ass, it does not follow the normal superhero rules.<br /><br />First of all the main character who is Kick-Ass is a geek. He is a
nobody in school and has a group of geeky friends. He lives alone with
his dad and even though he lives a pretty ordinary life, he is tired of
being bullied by street thugs and he is also tired of the people who
just watch and do nothing, so he decides to become Kick-Ass! Kick-Ass
is an awesome character. He has no special skills and a terrible outfit
to match. He tries to fight the thugs but is pretty much too much of a
weakling to really fight back, but he has heart and he does not give
up. In one of the fight scenes he meets Hit-Girl. She is the 11 year
old everyone is talking about and she is the one who steals the show!
She has amazing moves and is tougher than the Kick-Ass character.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fact that this is a comedy, even though there
are some funny scenes, it is not one of those goofy comedies where you
laugh through the whole movie. There is quite a few bloody/gore/violent
scenes that I did not expect and the young girl in the movie curses
often. Another thing I did not expect is a scene that is quite sad near
the end. I don&#x27;t want to give away anything so you will have to watch
it and see.<br /><br />I am hoping there will be a sequel to this one that can live up to the
first because it is such a good movie and with the way it ended, there
could be a sequel. I&#x27;m hoping!
