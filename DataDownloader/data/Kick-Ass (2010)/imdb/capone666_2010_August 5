Kick-Ass<br /><br />The reason why regular folks don&#x27;t take up the mantle of super-hero is
because empathy is their Kryptonite. Also, the hours suck.<br /><br />Luckily, the idealistic fan-boy in this bawdy comic book movie has the
compassion, free time and health coverage needed to combat crime.<br /><br />Tired of his mild-mannered existence, awkward teen Dave Lizewski (Aaron
Johnson) dons an emerald guise and patrols the streets as Kick-Ass.<br /><br />Garnering celebrity due to a viral video depicting his brutal brand of
justice, Kick-Ass soon attracts allies&#x96;Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit
Girl (Chlo&#xEB; Moretz)&#x96;and enemies&#x96;Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and
Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong).<br /><br />Based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr., Kick-Ass
is a cocksure concoction of sardonic scenarios, brutal violence and
offensive annotations all masterfully mixed together by director
Matthew Vaughn.<br /><br />Sadly, my own comic book alter ego would have to be the obsequious
henchmen: Kiss-Ass. (Green Light)
