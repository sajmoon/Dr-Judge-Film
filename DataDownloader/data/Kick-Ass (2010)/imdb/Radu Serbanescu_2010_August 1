Over the past 5 years more and more DC and Marvel heroes are making
their way to the big screen... Yeah most of them are top notch movies,
but Kick Ass is something else...<br /><br />The thing that makes it different is that the action (most of it) could
really take place, not just in some parallel universe where an alien
from Krypton wears his underwear on the outside or a teenager bitten by
a radioactive spider :D Kick Ass can be anyone of us who dreamed of
being a superhero even if he doesn&#x27;t have any special powers, but is
sick and tired of life being unfair.<br /><br />Take a chance and watch the movie (by the way it&#x27;s got good music and
some nice film effects) and it&#x27;s got a good rating after all :P
