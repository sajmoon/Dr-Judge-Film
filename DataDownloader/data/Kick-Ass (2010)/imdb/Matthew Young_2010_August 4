Dave is a depressed nerd who can&#x27;t understand why no one has every
tried to be a super hero and decides to try it himself and call himself
Kick Ass. While attempting to help out Katie Deauxma, his high school
crush, he encounters two other vigilantes named Hit Girl and Big Daddy;
a deranged father and daughter who are just a bit more serious about
dolling out justice.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is not soul-shattering stuff. It mostly consists of vulgar
jokes, gratuitous violence and super hero clich&#xE9;s. The characters
aren&#x27;t particularly interesting and outside of Chloe Moretz, who is
actually pretty impressive as Hit Girl, the acting is sub par. The plot
is a bit of a mess and it&#x27;s hard to really follow or care about what is
going on. Kick-Ass teeters between action and comedy and never really
finds a happy medium. It&#x27;s not funny enough to be a comedy and not
action oriented enough to be a proper action movie.<br /><br />The music is good and some of the action sequences are impressive, even
though suspension of disbelief is a must. I also have to commend
Kick-Ass for it&#x27;s originality and guts as Matthew Vaughn tried to
combine many genres and include particularly shocking elements; a
little girl slicing and dicing criminals with total relish. But, even
though I appreciate him pushing the envelope I dislike the fact that it
is used as a gimmick. It&#x27;s as if Vaughn is saying; &#x22;isn&#x27;t a little girl
killing people cool,&#x22; instead it just being part of the story.<br /><br />Despite it&#x27;s few good points Kick-Ass is a failure, mainly because of
what it could have been. What was hailed as an ingenious retooling of
the super hero genre feels very rehashed. You&#x27;ve heard these lines
before, you&#x27;ve seen these characters before and the comedy; you&#x27;ve not
laughed at before.
