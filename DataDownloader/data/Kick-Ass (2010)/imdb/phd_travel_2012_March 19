This is an unusually interesting comic book adaptation movie. It&#x27;s got
action but it&#x27;s actually part comedy romance and part teen movie. It&#x27;s
quite story driven too with interesting amusing dialog and voice overs.
IT doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously which is good. The violence is
there but it&#x27;s not as bad as some of the new movies. <br /><br />The leads are appealing Aaron Johnson has an expressive face and suits
the role. Lyndsy Fonseca is quite a charming love interest. Chloe
Moretz makes a rather controversial role quite cute as the violent kid.
Nicholas Cage is in a supporting role. <br /><br />Quite watchable and different.
