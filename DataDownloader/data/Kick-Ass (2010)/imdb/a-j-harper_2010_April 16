Nasty, sad film made for people who need to get out more. The only
funny part of watching this film was see that in a 350 seat cinema on a
Friday night 25 people had come in to watch it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it
to a dead rat. <br /><br />Its not about comic book hero&#x27;s. Its not funny. Its not ironic. Its not
making subtle references to other films. Its doesn&#x27;t make you think.<br /><br />Once you&#x27;ve heard f&#x27;&#x27;k over and over and over and over again, you&#x27;ve
seen the blood from xth baddie shoot out the back of his head, you&#x27;ve
tried to square the jarring contradictions, you realise that your just
not a liberal, balanced, intelligent person and your not able to
appreciate good knife edge work. Then you remember; course you are; it
just crap.
