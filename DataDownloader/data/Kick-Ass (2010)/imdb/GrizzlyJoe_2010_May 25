I&#x27;m not usually a fan of violent films. I found Sin City, while
artistically and stylistically interesting, kinda nauseating with the
violence and the gore. Oddly enough not so with Kick-Ass. For some
reason I was not only OK with it - I appreciated it. <br /><br />Kick-Ass is a fantasy film. It examines power, corruption, lies,
deception, honour and love. It speaks of the pain of powerlessness and
the hidden desires many of us have to simply fight back against those
who would intimidate and possibly destroy us. <br /><br />I won&#x27;t go into the plot. There are many reviews here that will explain
that to you. Nor will I bother to moralize about HitGirl&#x27;s language or
violence. Like I said, this is a fantasy film. She is a fictional
character and to equate her with any 11yo living is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve read reviews here that would place all sorts of filters on the
film - sociological, political, moral - but they&#x27;re ALL missing the
point. It&#x27;s a fantasy. A dream. It&#x27;s make-believe and it&#x27;s a hell of a
lot of fun. See it and make up your own mind.
