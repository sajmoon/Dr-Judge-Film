This is how they ought to be making films !! .the violence &#x26; profanity
in the film might be hard for some people to digest,but a good film
nevertheless.cannot believe so many people bash this film for being
pointless &#x26; meaningless.by far this is the best of all superhero movies
&#x26; certainly the best film released this year.I will admit that although
the story revolves around kick-ass,the star of this movie is
hit-girl.in my view she&#x27;s the best character in a film since &#x22;joker&#x22; in
dark knight.the box office numbers are quite surprising given the
amount of publicity it received.maybe because people don&#x27;t know what to
expect from this film &#x26; also the &#x22;R&#x22; rating attributed to it .THUMBS
UP! to the director for staying true to the comic book! I can&#x27;t wait
for the sequel !!!! also looking forward for the DVD which is said to
have 15 or more minutes of bonus footage.<br /><br />Fantastic film!!Thoroughly enjoyable!! 10/10
