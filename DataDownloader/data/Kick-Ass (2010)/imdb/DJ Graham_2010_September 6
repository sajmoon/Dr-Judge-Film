I waited for the iTunes download to watch it. and I loved it. It was
like watching Kill Bill but with a 10 year old instead of Uma Thurman.
Yep there is bad language and lots of violence. Who cares. The
storyline moved along well and kept me entertained. The characters were
all great and Hit Girl was a complete success. <br /><br />I have to recommend this film but just remember that despite the kids
it has a lot of ass kicking in it. The ending was a little flat but
that is compared to the good quality of the film as a whole. Looking
forward to watching the sequel now :)<br /><br />I see that the Hit Girl actress is also staring in the great film &#x22;Let
me in&#x22;. I saw the Swedish version and it was brilliant. If she carries
on like this then she has a bright future.
