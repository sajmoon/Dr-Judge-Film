Amazing is what I think about this movie right now.<br /><br />If truth be told, Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; has given us a new edge
in the comic based movies.<br /><br />Actions are fast and gritty still it has the essence of some comic
relief in between to have some light moments.<br /><br />The story is simple, where a regular teenager round the block decides
to be a super hero calling himself as &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; and faces the reality
of what it takes to be a &#x27;Hero&#x27;. Circumstances changes when he comes
across vigilante father and daughter team who call themselves as &#x27;Big
Daddy&#x27; and &#x27;Hit Girl&#x27;; who clean the streets by killing the men working
for powerful drug Lord Frank D&#x27;Amico. Well... I will not go into any
further details because it surly will give away the plot and I don&#x27;t
wish to do so for those who haven&#x27;t seen this movie yet.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson as &#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; has really done a great job, but the main
lure for this movie is Chlo&#xEB; Moretz as &#x27;Hit Girl&#x27;; she is simply
awesome. Nicolas Cage as &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; or rather the side kick had been
perfect and revived himself in a much better way than what we have seen
in his earlier title at &#x27;Ghost Rider&#x27;.<br /><br />Remember &#x27;Sin City&#x27; this movie too has lots of profanity and violence;
no doubt this got &#x27;R&#x27; rating but I will not at all be complaining
because this movie has offered us exactly what we wanted to see. <br /><br />The soundtrack is also soothing and by the time the credit rolls the
song &#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; by Mika will be lingering in the mind for quite some
time. This movie is surly not to be missed. So far 2010 start has
offered some good movies, apart from &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; I can say &#x27;Kick-
Ass&#x27; can too join the league of success.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know whether any sequel will be upcoming or not but as a stand
alone title this will unquestionably win the universal movie goers
heart and support.<br /><br />This movie really KICKS ASS!!!! In every literal sense<br /><br />Well &#x22;Shut Up. Kick-Ass&#x22; :)
