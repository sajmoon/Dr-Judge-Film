A hilariously over-the-top campy comic book adaptation. Aaron Johnson
and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are pretty good in their dorky roles. But
Chloe Moretz is awesome as Hit Girl and has some laugh-out-loud
one-liners. She steals every scene she&#x27;s in, complementing or
offsetting Nicholas Cage&#x27;s uneven performance as Big Daddy. The film
also serves as an interesting social commentary about our passive,
spectator YouTube culture, a satire about the glorification of violence
and our modern devolution into a world of social apathy. Perhaps that
is why the premise of the film -- real-life superheroes -- is so
foreign to the audience at the outset until the extreme violence
reminds you to sit back and enjoy: it&#x27;s just a comic book.
