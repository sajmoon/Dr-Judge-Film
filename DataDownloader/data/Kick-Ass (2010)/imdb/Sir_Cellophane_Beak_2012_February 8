Some films sound like great ideas and probably storyboard very
well...but then fall way short. Kick A** is exactly that kind of film;
the whole time I was thinking how good the basic concept was, how well
shot and considered the film was. Yet, I was bored senseless, I felt
cheated and uninterested. Cage has some great moments, given his
outlandish character, and Moretz does fantastically as a young child
actor pulling of quite an adult portrayal. The special effects and
fight scenes are fantastic (and far better than similarly-conceived
Alien Contamination), the shot composition and coloring is brilliant.<br /><br />Sounds like it should be a great film, yeah? Yeah, I thought so too.
The characters never really develop any empathy with the audience, the
story keeps undercutting itself--a funny scene suddenly gets incredibly
dark, or a real moment is gutted by stupid humor. Worse, the writing
was not well thought out--characters change on the head of a pin, even
within one scene--which really conflicts with the realness I felt they
were going for. I feel like the main problem of the film was it didn&#x27;t
know what it wanted to be: a funny action film, an action film with
humor, or a film with social context and critique. I never felt like
the film achieved making me think about my life, so its not that, and
the other two it was just confused on. Go see Prince of Persia: The
Sands of Time, which did a fantastic job of combining humor and action
in a similar fashion, but didn&#x27;t try and make you care about the
characters. If you want a story about superheroes in a modern context,
READ Iron Man (avoid the films).
