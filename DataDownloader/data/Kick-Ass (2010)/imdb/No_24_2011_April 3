2011_April 3 
I&#x27;m going to keep this short and simple. If you&#x27;ve read and loved the
comics, stay away from this movie. They slaughter the story, they have
some of the same key points but besides that they basically just took
the story and decided to ruin it as much as possible. I understand them
wanting to change certain aspects of the story such as the violence,
but they did much more then that. The casting is terrible with the
exception of Chloe Moretz, I loathed Aaron Johnson as kick-ass. He
turned Kick-Ass into this self centered jerk who you want to see beat
up, he would&#x27;ve been better as a mugger or bully.But like I said in
short if you loved the comic you&#x27;ll hate this movie I couldn&#x27;t bare to
watch it past the five minute mark.
