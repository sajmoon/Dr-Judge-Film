Kick Ass is going to be one of those movies where audiences differ at
both ends of the spectrum.<br /><br />This movie is super hyped by the media and sitting in the theater I
could not see why it has the hype. Someone wrote on IMDb &#x22;This movie is
laugh out loud where I missed things and have to go back and see it
again&#x22;. I did not laugh one single time in this film. I was starting to
wonder if I just didn&#x27;t get the movie, but after 40 minutes I noticed
that no one else in the theater was laughing either. I guess no one got
it. As I left the theater, I was behind a couple and the man said &#x22;this
was a a waste of time.&#x22; I have to agree with that statement.<br /><br />I thought about it and I believe that this movie is as dull,
uninspired, unimaginative and as boring as Napolean Dynamite. I think
if you are a fan of Napolean Dynamite then you would enjoy this film.
For those of us who are older, I do not see you liking this movie. The
acting is so bland that it reminds you of the times when Saturday Night
Live tried to take a 30 second skit and make a full length movie out of
it. The movie is advertised as a Superhero wannabe--it isn&#x27;t. This
movie is about vigilante justice--it is mass murder by the &#x22;good guys&#x22;
on an extreme level. The one good point of the film can also be
considered a great example of a kind of child abuse. The 10 year old
character is the best part of the movie, yet the director decided that
she should continually spout the F-bomb and the big C. Was that
necessary? No--it had no impact on the film whatsoever.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie, but that is why we all have different
tastes--because I know others enjoyed it a lot.
