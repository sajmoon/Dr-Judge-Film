This is an excellent movie, heroic-inspiring, a call to not back up in
front of the bad guys, and not to tolerate them, but to kick them
asses! I love it! Unfortunately, the guys in the movie looks like the
hobbits in the Lord of the Rings, which destroys part of the suspense.
Not all, happily. The movie is worthing every penny and is a lesson for
everyone, kid, teen or grown-up, every one should see and learn from
this movie about the right thing, the sacrifice and the honour that we
lost long ago! Time to claim it back! And the girl Katie has a nice
pair of panties, too... So, go to the movie, and when you see a bad
guy, act in the ways you can do it, because that is what we all should
do. My thanks to the creator of this movie, for reminded us what is the
human spirit after all... and that is, fighting evil in order to
evolve! Keep this in mind!
