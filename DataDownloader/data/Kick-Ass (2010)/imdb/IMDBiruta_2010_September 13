For the &#x27;quickers&#x27;: If you&#x27;re a teenager who doesn&#x27;t watch that many
movies (especially Black and White ones) and likes teenagers, sex and
violence stories, watch this movie! You&#x27;ll love it! If you&#x27;re someone
who watch a lot of movies, who trained yourself to see them with a
sharp eye, and you&#x27;re alone, still for you I think you should see it,
so you can say &#x22;Yes! I saw it! And I think it is rubbish&#x22; Now if you&#x27;re
in the second case and you want a good movie, so you can feel it was
well spent money, don&#x27;t even bother to watch.<br /><br />Now I can explain for those who want to know why I said that.<br /><br />First of all I congratulate Chloe Moretz for her work and character.
However much she is a 12-year-old girl being a disturbing murderer (not
hero, heroes don&#x27;t kill cold blooded), when she is in the screen she
really &#x22;steels the show&#x22; and it is a &#x22;star making performance from
her&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; is clearly a movie to watch. It is so because it is
different, not usual at all. But let&#x27;s put everything on the right
place.<br /><br />&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; takes free violence to a whole new level. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of
other movies that doesn&#x27;t show that much of blood all around, bullet
holes in the heads, knifes flying... Well, special effects for that
effect. And yet they had so much more meaning when it (which I&#x27;m
talking about death, the end of a human being&#x27;s life) occurs. I&#x27;ve
realized that in the movie there is a certain idea to be taken, which
is (now, I don&#x27;t think this is a spoiler, but it could be felt like it.
If you don&#x27;t want to risk, skip to next paragraph): it shows what would
happen if any regular high school kid decide to become a super-hero, he
would be bitten up as crudely as the first time the character Kick Ass
decide to do his super hero job. So at that point I respect that crude
violence. It is done well and shown perfectly. But as the movie goes
on, it is not quite the same.<br /><br />I can tell this is a movie to entertain, and obviously I can say that
many people felt entertained. Off course! The people who made the movie
studied hard and worked out their asses to learn how to make a movie
entertaining. And since most of the people who will watch the movie
doesn&#x27;t know about how they do it, it is even easier to entertain.<br /><br />The movie is made for high school kids, so be it, talk about teenager
problems, such as friends, drugs, sex, the search for identity,
popularity, homosexuality, etc etc. And lately, resulting from many of
the video and computer games I guess, the ease to kill. There you go,
you don&#x27;t need to be a genius to know that a movie with such
ingredients will be entertaining for the age you&#x27;re aiming for, and
that it will work and sell. In my opinion, and I believe that it is the
opinion of many of the regular movie watchers (of all kind, not only
teenager kind), it is not a good movie because it doesn&#x27;t have true
brain effort behind it. It is a movie made to sell. Not to be loved and
remembered but to make easy money.<br /><br />Just to add a technical opinion. Some of it&#x27;s parts tried to use the
disturbed violence with intense music, the one that makes people get
serious in the cinema room, that was, for example, so well reached by
the character of the Joker (Heath Ledger) in Batman &#x96; The Dark Knight.
The only difference is that the disturbed violence could have a
connection with the disturbed character played by Heath Ledger, so it
makes sense, and worked wonderfully. In the Kick Ass movie it doesn&#x27;t
have a connection with neither the character or the situation, so it
doesn&#x27;t work at all. It is made only to make the adrenaline go high in
those phew minutes by such crude and free violence.
