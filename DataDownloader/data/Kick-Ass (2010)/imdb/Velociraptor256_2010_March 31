If you&#x27;re a fan of comic book movies, you should definitely check out
Kick-Ass &#x96; it&#x27;s not a typical superhero flick, and it&#x27;s definitely not
for the faint-hearted. As befitting the film&#x27;s basic premise &#x96; the idea
of costumed vigilantes in the real world &#x96; most of the action is
grounded in reality (with a few notable exceptions), and while it&#x27;s
always thrilling, it&#x27;s also very intense and often seriously brutal,
enough to make you cringe. Unlike in many comic book movies, you really
feel the punishment that the heroes both take and dish out.<br /><br />That said, when the film&#x27;s trying to be funny, it does that really well
too &#x96; there&#x27;s quite a few pop culture references and mentions of other
superheroes, but they&#x27;re usually humorous and fit in well, unlike some
other movies. The acting is great all round: as plenty of other people
have noted, Chloe Moretz steals the show as Hit Girl, and provides the
best action in the film as well.<br /><br />All in all, powerful action, great humour, and an interesting story
make Kick-Ass a fantastic film.
