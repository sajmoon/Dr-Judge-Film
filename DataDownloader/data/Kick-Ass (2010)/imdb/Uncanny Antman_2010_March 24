Really, so much fun that I couldn&#x27;t stop grinning and raving after
leaving the cinema. I won&#x27;t go into much detail because all I really
want to say is, &#x27;Go see it.&#x27; You won&#x27;t regret it. ...Unless you have a
problem with violence and/or political incorrectness.<br /><br />I really hope some parents take their kids to this one; it will teach
them to mind ratings better. Kick-Ass is rated R for a reason. Almost
all of the violence and language is in service of making things
hilarious, but there are still some pretty brutal kills.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t wait &#x27;til it gets a full release here in Australia so that I
can see it again.<br /><br />Big ten out of ten.
