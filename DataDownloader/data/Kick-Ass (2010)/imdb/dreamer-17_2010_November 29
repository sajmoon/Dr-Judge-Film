This movie was well done, great acting, filming, timing. Great
originality and lines. I usually watch action movies so violence
doesn&#x27;t usually bother me, but this one did.<br /><br />Great for adults and mature teens, not for kids because of the violence
and sexual connotations (and of course, language but you can tell that
from the title).<br /><br />I think what made it seem more violent than other movies was the
realism. The realism is what makes this movie so good, but also makes
the violence hard to take. If the violence was not quite so realistic,
I would have been able to relax and enjoy the great plot. <br /><br />I watch movies to escape realism and life&#x27;s problems.
