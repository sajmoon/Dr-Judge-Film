I have heard so many great things about this movie. About how it&#x27;s one
of the most original, funny, entertaining, vulgar comic book films
ever. And I agree that it was unique, humorous, not boring, and was
definitely vulgar. I couldn&#x27;t help but feel a little disappointed with
the final product when I finally sat down and watched it, but that
doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad.<br /><br />I liked the main character, I liked the fact that he wasn&#x27;t a jock, a
science nerd, or a rich kid, he&#x27;s just a normal, average guy. I loved
Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, they kicked so much ass I wanted to see so much
more of them.<br /><br />But for the most part, the movie doesn&#x27;t really focus that much on the
characters and more or less focuses on the action, which is fine.
Really, there&#x27;s not much I can complain about in this movie, it was
fun, unique, creative, and funny, but I just don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s so
popular.
