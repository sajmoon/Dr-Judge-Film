Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s last two films, Kick-Ass clearly
seemed like his most controversial outing to date, without even
comparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust both
though enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to the
distributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no matter
what the genre and that he deserves the room for development, since
showing he is capable of great potential.<br /><br />Then came along Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must see&#x27;s,
simply because it is nothing and everything like you expect. Example:
Expect the costumes to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb from
an 11 year old girl and expect a finale that almost makes the end of
Kill Bill Volume 1 look like a fairytale. However what wasn&#x27;t expected
was the hilarious conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as a
Earless Batman) and his daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring Chloe
Moretz) and the vast amount of violence, dark humour and the way it
walks all over society like another blood splattered corpse of
satisfaction.<br /><br />Dave Livewski (Aaron Johnson) struggles to understand why there is no
active costumed vigilante&#x27;s around in New York to stop crime, and
through his comic inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The hero
this time, not the film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit,
determination and lack of social life, Dave&#x27;s roller-coaster begins.
His near fatal experience&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hinder his growing reputation or
superhero buddies including Red Mist (Superbad&#x27;s Christopher
Mintz-Plasse) and the infamous father-daughter duo to bringing
blood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden city.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldn&#x27;t be ashamed to enjoy
on the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings. There
is a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done justice
to make the most of their characters capabilities; Chloe Moretz
deserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the &#x27;Gonna
blow your brains out&#x27; in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has clearly
established himself as a man of many talents and after this it&#x27;s not
hard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the horizon,
that&#x27;s for sure.
