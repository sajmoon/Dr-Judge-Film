I am a big comic book and action movie nerd, and in no way am I a movie
snob to the action genre. I&#x27;m the kind of guy who let things like the
dance sequence in Spiderman 3 not get to me or the nuke the fridge
scene in Indian Jones 4 bother me. Even though those scenes are
incredibly stupid I try to look at the film as a whole, and worry more
about story, characters, and action to be the big factor of whats good
and whats bad. With that said Kick-ass has some of the best ideas, and
characterization of any super-hero movie. <br /><br />The main character Dave who becomes Kick-ass, is the likable nerd that
we&#x27;ve seen in a hundred movies. However, it makes him very relate-able,
and it makes the idea of being a real life super hero seem more
realistic. His love interest thinks he&#x27;s gay and only hangs out with
him because of sympathy, and he only becomes a super hero just to see
if it could be done. The action scenes with Kick-ass are great, because
it truly looks like somebody not knowing what their doing trying to
fight street thugs, and every hit looks painful, brutal, and realistic.
The story gets really interesting seeing him fighting crime, because it
brings on a chain reaction through the media, his social life, other
heroes, and organized crime. There are some very serious and shocking
moments and some highly comedic moments in the film which help give it
even more realism. Real life isn&#x27;t always comical or serious it is a
blend of both. <br /><br />So where does this movie go wrong for me? Two words. Hit Girl. Before
you start flaming me hear me out. I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on
what was wrong with the film until every problem I could think of
generally came back to her. For one thing she completely steals the
show. She gets the most action scenes by far, and making her 11 years
old adds to the shock value of her fowl mouth and her massacre of bad
guys. To me it started losing it&#x27;s charm once she was killing waves and
waves of people. I understand it is supposed to be ironic, satirical,
and funny but neither of those things work for me. Not only that but it
takes away from the realism and the humor of Kick-ass&#x27;s story.
Everything seems to be in the realm of possibility. I could see an
average high school student wanting to be a super-hero. I&#x27;m sure it has
crossed a lot of people&#x27;s minds. But having a 11 year old girl being
trained her whole life to kill is suddenly thrown in to that plot
really breaks up the rhythm of the film. <br /><br />I also found the ending entertaining and funny, but I didn&#x27;t think it
was good. It just got even more ridiculous, and I didn&#x27;t like what they
did with Red Mist&#x27;s character, but I don&#x27;t want to spoil it for you. So
bottom line. This isn&#x27;t the new Dark Knight, or Citizen Kane of Super
Hero films some people are making it out to be. It is simply a good
action movie with some cool ideas, and some enjoyable yet completely
ludicrous scenes. I think other film makers should take some ideas from
the good parts, and people who like these movies and just want to veg
out should see it.
