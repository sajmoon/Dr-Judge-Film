2010_September 6 
I just watched this with my 15 year old daughter for the second time.
This movie is just pure fun, excellent pacing and the soundtrack is
exceptional.<br /><br />For all you naysayers, this is just pure entertainment. I am not one
for excessive violence but the violence is just so beyond the realm of
reality that it is funny, as it should be. Do I cover my eyes for the
worst scenarios? Of course I do! I really didn&#x27;t want to see the bad
guy get nuked.<br /><br />I do have an issue with gratuitous violence in movies such as &#x22;Natural
Born Killers&#x22; which was mentioned in other reviews. I found that film
quite disturbing because the good are corrupt and the bad get away with
everything. It has a completely different atmosphere compared to this
film which is just plain fun and in the end good wins over evil.<br /><br />I do agree that it would have been possible to make this movie just as
effective without as much graphic violence but I&#x27;m not willing to pan
it because of that. Hit Girl has her head square on her shoulders! (as
does my daughter, which is why she could watch it without any undue
distress) This movie is in the league of &#x22;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day
Off&#x22;....one of those gems that you can watch over and over again as the
years pass... It will always make you laugh out loud no matter how many
times you&#x27;ve seen it.
