Just back from Kick-Ass and all i can say is WOW what a blast, this has
to be one of the best superhero movies ever made, dare i say it &#x22;its up
there with The Dark Knight&#x22;. The basic premise is simple, what we have
is a geek that dreams of being a superhero, then one day he finally
builds up the courage to go out there and fight crime, however he is
very rusty around the edge&#x27;s because he has no real training and
therefor gets his Ass-Kicked from time to time, but the kid has heart..
He then comes across too other superhero&#x27;s (Big Dady &#x26; Hit Girl) but
they are the real deal, and they have been trained well especially Hit
Girl. So what follows are these crime busting hero&#x27;s who are out to get
the bad guys and when the action hits, it hits hard. Not only does it
work as a great action film it also works as a great comedy, and one of
the cool things about the movie is that we really do care about the
characters and what they go through. The overall look of the film is
very slick, the violence in some parts are brutal but fun, and some of
the set pieces towards the end are just OTT, but it all merges
perfectly in the confinements of this beautiful comic book world.. This
comes highly recommended, hope they bring out a sequel...
