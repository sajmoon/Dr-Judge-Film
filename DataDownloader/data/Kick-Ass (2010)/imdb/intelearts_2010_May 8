A lot of reviewers here are more concerned about others morals than
just simply enjoying a film for what it is - if they went in expecting
a superhero movie and didn&#x27;t like le th&#xE9;&#xE2;tre du grand-Guignol approach
should have done their research.<br /><br />This is not a film for dose whose only knowledge of comics and
superheroes comes from knowing who and not what Spiderman, Superman
are. This is a movie for those who know and have read Sandman and Mus,
it&#x27;s for those whose sense of irony and action is more in the Shoot&#x27;Em
up, Wanted mould. I didn&#x27;t find it that &#x22;violent&#x22;, though it is, but it
is as I said Guignol rather than action thriller, there are OTT bullets
and knives aplenty around by the end.<br /><br />The first half is really just about ordinary guy who dons a costume and
messes up, but it is the second story of the cocaine mafia and Hit Girl
that completely takes over and triumphantly steals the show.<br /><br />This reminded more of the Tick than Superman, it is about a YouTube,
Fark generation and it is fun, funny, and hip.<br /><br />Not perfect by any means it is the best action film around at the
moment and it full of self-irony and nods to a bunch of post-modern
sensibilities.<br /><br />All in all, surprisingly both stupid and intelligent, and well, just
plain fun...
