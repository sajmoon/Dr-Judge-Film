2010_June 10 
Well, first off, this is one of the most charming, enjoyable and
entertaining movies I&#x27;ve seen so far and all this thanks to it&#x27;s
original basic mood, good pacing, the delightful cast and the almost
fantastic fact, that Kick-Ass absolutely has the balls to leap over
those certain borders as it is not desperately craving for ratings and
family friendliness, like most could expect from a mainstream movie.
For all this, a cheerful and ecstatic BRAVO.<br /><br />But. Having all this together, the possibilities would have been at
least to make on of the the most original movies in this genre, an
opportunity which has been missed. The startup is hilarious and keeping
up that tendency probably would have got this movie into history, but
at a certain point, it takes a different direction where people (let me
quote) &#x22;...have the expensive s*** that does not exist...&#x22; and the 11
year old girl&#x27;s beating up crowds of ripped crack dealers and
professional criminals etc.. And there we are again at the usual
concept, which really was a mayor letdown for me. Especially as the
movie sets up it&#x27;s own rules, of not doing exactly THIS. However,
watching it the second time, without awaiting a wonder, I liked it more
and by the way, the comic book narrative is just greatly executed.<br /><br />But let me tell you, without tasteless quoting, this movie rather
frequently suffers from some seriously bad dialog, please guys, that
was not necessary.<br /><br />Otherwise, thanks you for this great ride and bring on the sequel, but
please, without prostituting the whole thing to do better at the box
office.<br /><br />8/10 and secretly one of my favorites (who didn&#x27;t ever think about
being a super hero?)
