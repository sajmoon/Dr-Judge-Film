Had looked forward to seeing this movie but was really disappointed.<br /><br />It seemed to me that the makers didn&#x27;t know what they were trying to
create: a teen-comedy? a comic-based actioner? an uber-violent fable?
None of these worked.<br /><br />I thought all the characters did their stuff well: Nicolas Cage and, of
course, Chloe Moretz were fun to watch but the in the end, the overall
package was well short of satisfactory.<br /><br />Others might disagree but I felt very uncomfortable watching a 10 year
old girl being beaten up (quite realistically) on screen. Maybe this
film wasn&#x27;t intended for fathers of ten year old girls?
