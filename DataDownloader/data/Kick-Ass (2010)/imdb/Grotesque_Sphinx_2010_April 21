Kick Ass is one of few films that are adapted from comic book and
actually did a good job. Three of Tim Burton&#x27;s Batman plus two of
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s, X2: X-Men United, Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, Sin City
are also among those few.Superman Returns was so-so, Hulks are okay,
and Fantastic Four is not bad. Wolverine, Catwoman, Wanted, League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen, and many more fall into a miserable category.<br /><br />The humor in Kick Ass kicks on the right places, while the actions are
not half-hearted. Even though the title hero is Aaron Johnston&#x27;s Kick
Ass, the real kick ass is definitely Chloe Moretz who played Hit Girl.
She&#x27;s tough, furious,foul-mouthed, and yes...she&#x27;s eleven.<br /><br />This film is going to be a classic.
