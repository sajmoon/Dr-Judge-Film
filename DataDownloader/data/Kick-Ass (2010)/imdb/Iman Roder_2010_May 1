I thought the controversy behind Kick Ass was overblown, but having
watched it, I get it now. I expected to something goofy like Mystery
Men, with Ben Stiller. It was more like the Professional, with the star
turning performance by a pre-pubescent Natalie Portman.<br /><br />My friend and I watched it in shocked amazement. We kept saying, this
is awesome but f-ed up! It&#x27;s the same feeling you get watching The
Professional, its heartwarming, the performances are great, the story
is riveting...but its f-ing brutal and you&#x27;re watching a child, a young
girl be trained to be a psychopath! The difference here is its not
voluntary, its a life she&#x27;s born into. It seems right but its so sad
and so wrong! <br /><br />It&#x27;s definitely an interesting twist on what you&#x27;d think would be a
straight forward goofy teenage comedy. Any way, if you have a daughter
this may well offend you. But, if you&#x27;re willing to stomach it, it&#x27;s a
hell of a fun ride!
