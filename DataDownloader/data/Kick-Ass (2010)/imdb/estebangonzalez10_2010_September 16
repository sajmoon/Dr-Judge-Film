&#xA8; Had I ever been a real super hero? The most I&#x27;d ever had to offer the
world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a
kicking. With no power comes no responsibility, except that wasn&#x27;t
true. &#xA8; (9/10) Director Matthew Vaughn has done a fantastic job once
again directing this super hero movie, where these heroes actually
don&#x27;t have anything super about them. This is Vaughn&#x27;s third feature
film after directing Stardust and Layer Cake, and both films were
received warmly by the critics and audiences alike. I have to admit
that I really loved this ultra-violent movie and was really entertained
throughout the entire film. Hit-Girl makes Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill
look like an amateur. Of course we don&#x27;t have the Tarantino dialogue
with this film, but the action and the performances are highly
entertaining. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn adapted the screenplay
from Mark Miller&#x27;s comic book of the same name. Miller&#x27;s previous comic
book, Wanted, was also made into a film starring Angelina Jolie, but I
think Kick-Ass is far more superior and probably one of my favorite
movies of the year. Yes, the violence is gratuitous and the language is
strong, but watching this 11 year old girl fighting all these criminals
is just priceless. She steals every scene she is in. This is not your
regular super hero movie and definitely not one you will want to miss
because it is an extremely fun ride. In my opinion Kick-Ass is last
year&#x27;s Zombieland combining violence with comedy. Many people were
turned down by the violence and the language in this movie, so I know
it is not for everyone, but I think that what Matthew Vaughn did in
this film was just brilliant, and one can tell he is influenced by his
close friend Guy Ritchie.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary kid who isn&#x27;t very popular
in school. He hangs around with two of his close friends, Marty (Clark
Duke, Hot Tub Machine) and Todd (Evan Peters), reading and visiting
comic book stores. Dave begins to wonder why no one decides to become a
super hero and fight crime. Despite not having any special powers or
any fighting abilities whatsoever he decides to become a masked
vigilante and calls himself Kick-Ass. One day while he is on his super
hero duty he encounters a couple of thieves and tries to stop them from
stealing a car. Kick-Ass gets seriously injured and ends up in a
hospital. Several metal plates are put in his body due to all his
fractures, and they actually make him a little more resistible to
punches. Little does Dave know that there actually two other masked
vigilantes with vast experience on fighting organized crime. Big Daddy
(Nicolas Cage) and his highly trained eleven year old daughter,
Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) have been fighting against a mafia boss named
Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong, Sherlock Holmes). One day the three masked
heroes meet and they give Kick-Ass some advice on the business.
Kick-Ass seems to have inspired other people to become super heroes and
suddenly there is a new one in the streets who calls himself Red Mist
(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is actually Frank&#x27;s son. None of these
super heroes actually have any special power and the violence begins to
escalate as the movie progresses, but always combining it with a great
dose of comedy.<br /><br />The true star of the film is Chloe Moretz who plays the eleven year old
Hit-Girl who is highly trained in fighting and instead of playing with
dolls, she plays with knives. She is just fun to watch on screen and
one of my new favorite characters. Nicolas Cage is also good playing
the eccentric Big Daddy and Aaron Johnson is great in the lead role.
Kick-Ass can be compared to Clive Owen&#x27;s Shoot Em Up because of all the
cartoonish violence on screen, but I found it more similar to Kill
Bill, although with a much more climatic ending. I found the dialogue
to be quite funny and mixed well with the action scenes. The movie
isn&#x27;t deep and you probably can&#x27;t get anything out of it, but it is
highly entertaining and such a fun experience. I haven&#x27;t been this
entertained in a long time and Kick-Ass is one of those movies I
wouldn&#x27;t mind watching over and over again. I definitely recommend this
film and know it will be hard to top entertainingly wise.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/
