I would first like to say that I&#x27;ve been excited to see this movie ever
sense it was announced at comic con, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I will
admit I haven&#x27;t read the comic(yet), but my friend which has read it
says its pretty accurate but they&#x27;re some definite differences. When
the movie was over I said to myself, &#x22;man I really wish this movie
wasn&#x27;t over&#x22;, and then people started starring at me because I was
talking to myself, but thats another story.<br /><br />This movie is fun and action packed, this is one of the best movies
I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.<br /><br />10/10
