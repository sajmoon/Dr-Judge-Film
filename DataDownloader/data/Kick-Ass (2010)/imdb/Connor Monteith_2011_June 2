&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is a comedy about superheroes. Dave Lizewski lives in New
York. He is a huge comic book fan, who is unnoticed at school and lives
alone with his father. One day he makes a decision to become a
superhero, without any training or super powers. He tries to &#x22;save&#x22;
people who look like they are in trouble, but ends up failing each
time. In one of his superhero attempts, Dave successfully helps a man
who is being hunted by 3 men in front of a cafeteria. The teenagers
watching the fight record the fight and upload the footage to the
internet. This is when Dave proclaims his self as &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;. Frank
D&#x27;Amico, a gang leader, believes that &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is responsible for the
actions against his gang members. As he is being hunted, he meets up
with 2 real superheroes, &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; and &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22;.<br /><br />The director, Matthew Vaughn, successfully shows how superheroes come
into existence. The film is a fantastic mix of action and comedy. Each
individual character is created very thoroughly, and the viewer can see
deeply into each character.<br /><br />&#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; (also known as Mindy Macready) is a 12 year old super hero
played by Chloe Grace Moretz. Her performances with Nicolas Cage (Damon
Macready/Big Daddy) were great. She by far gives the best presentation.
Although all the actors were great playing their roles, Moretz is my
number 1 favourite actress, And to be honest, if she wasn&#x27;t in it, I
may have not watched the movie. This is probably one of her best films
to date. 10/10 for her acting, looks, and presentation. Another good
thing is that she would never swear in real life. Personal Quote: &#x22;As
Chloe, I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never uttered a syllable of a curse
word, not even behind closed doors.&#x22; - Chloe Grace Moretz<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone with a like for comedy or action. The
film will have a way to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />9/10 - best film of the year!
