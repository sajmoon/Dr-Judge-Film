This is not a comedy! and if they would have been honest on what the
movie was really about chances are I would have gone to see it anyway.
There are a lot of very depressing and horrific moments in this movie
which is fine as long as you&#x27;re not lying to people in your advertising
and leading people to believe this is a light hearted comedy about
teenage misfits fighting crime. There is nothing funny about this movie
and in the end it&#x27;s all about revenge, violence and a twelve year old
girl dressed up like a common street whore arbitrarily murdering
people. I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews where people have actually taken their
children to see this movie. &#x22;Do not take your little ones to see this
movie&#x22; unless you want to explain sex, death, drug use and why human
heads explode when put in a microwave.
