&#x22;Kick ass&#x22; is an absolute pathetic excuse for a movie. Just the other
day, we were talking in school about how cinema is not cinema anymore,
since it is constantly evolving and the boundaries of motion-pictures
(and the subsequent visual representations) are broken.<br /><br />Well, making an analogy with Evolutionism, this shouldn&#x27;t even appear
on the evolution scale. A total waste of money and resources. And
you&#x27;ve got Nicholas Cage in it, to cap it off. It&#x27;s all clich&#xE9;s and
using classical music for such gross and distasteful scenes is a
regretful. And it makes for a cheap movie. <br /><br />Save your neurons and a few money, donate it to the Japan Rescue Fund
or something!
