I had heard lots of good things about this. Random reviewers on the
interwebs, professional critics and my friends all seem to love this.
Obviously, I had to see what the hype was all about but I was also
careful not to keep my expectations too high so that I wouldn&#x27;t be
disappointed. Guess what, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Now, I wasn&#x27;t expecting an intriguing deep psychological movie or
anything. I wanted to see a fun &#x27;popcorn&#x27; movie with exciting action
scenes and a nice portion of good humour. But the movie failed to
deliver this for quite a few reasons. Firstly, even though there were
some funny moments, a lot of the humour was based on swearing and
sexual references (surprise, surprise). However, the humour itself is
on short supply as a lot of the movie is wasted on drama and sappiness,
something a popcorn movie should not have more than a few minutes of.
Plus, the violence is a little too gruesome to actually fit into a fun
movie. Just put the equation together and think about what we have
here. I&#x27;ll use &#x27;Hit-girl&#x27; as an example. A strong little girl who
constantly swears and takes part in all kinds of messed up violence,
but also manages to have a sappy, dramatic history. Awww... how cute...
NOT. Perhaps the movie should be named &#x27;Hit-girl&#x27;, because other than
the fact that &#x27;Kick-ass&#x27; is narrating and is simply in more scenes than
her, there is nothing to insinuate that he is the main character.
&#x27;Hit-girl&#x27; had a much more important role in the story. But anyways,
none of the characters are really likable, there way too much use of
loud music in the a lot of the scenes, and nothing in particular sticks
out about the whole film.<br /><br />This movie did not live up to my expectations, let alone the hype. It
did keep me entertained, but not in a mind blowing way. Even though the
story gave the movie some potential, it turned out to be pretty
average.
