Do we want to see more Columbines in this country? If your answer &#x22;yes&#x22;
to the question then keep making movies (and computer games too) like
this one and tell kids it&#x27;s o.k. to kill people (killing itself is
enough brutal but they even choose more disgusting ways to do that in
this movie) revenge, guns, blood is good, buying guns online easy,
there is no justice out there so get your toys (guns) and go after
other people and kill them. And then we are wondering how COLUMBINE or
other teenage mass murdering happened in this country?<br /><br />As i walked out this movie i felt very sad to see all those young kids
who were in the movie theater to see this movie.
