There has been many, many, many, many, many, many, many (clt-v is
awesome) comic book movies in the past several years, with some being
good, some being bad, and some being downright ugly (Hulk anyone?).
However, we rarely get movies that celebrate the entire genre the way
horror was celebrated by Shaun of the Dead and Slither and spaghetti
westerns were celebrated by almost anything Tarantino (loose
exaggeration, I know). Kick-Ass however ends this drought by becoming
the bad-ass, kick-ass, slam-bang roundabout kick to the face of a movie
that the fans had been hoping for. This film is not just a nice homage
to all things comics; it&#x27;s also a wonderful story full of action,
suspense, a bit of drama, and all blending in with dark humor. If you
like your comic book movies raw, smart, engaging, and downright fun,
then Kick-Ass should be your cup of martini.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is about a typical teenager named Dave (Aaron Johnson) that
wants to become a superhero to help those in need, and to add a bit of
purpose into his life. After accidentally being shown online trying to
fight a gang, a slew of wanna-be superheroes followed suit, with some
actually rising to become serious threats to villains of New York City.
Based off a new-generation comic book written by Mark Millar and John
Romita Jr., this film successfully takes the homages, grueling humor,
and intense moments from the comic book and translates it to the screen
with very little filler space. Written by the director Matthew Vaughn
and Jane Goldman, Kick-Ass manages to cover a lot of ground, backstory
and all, without ever dragging the movie. And unlike your usual comic
book dialogue, there isn&#x27;t a single line that made you want to cringe
or squeal in disgust.<br /><br />What makes this movie totally work and keep you entertained, is the
likability of every character on screen. Part of this has to do with
the writing, but most of it is the superb acting. Aaron Johnson shines
in the lead role, by mixing vulnerability with a delightful
down-to-earth personality that&#x27;s easy to relate to. In terms of
emotions, Kick-Ass most resembles Spider-Man, a person who accidentally
receives some powers but carries a lot of emotional weight with his
newfound glory.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz delivered the best performances by
portraying a sentimental and deadly father-daughter team that provided
some of the best laughs and some of the heavier moments. Moretz is
incredible, especially for someone her age; she isn&#x27;t your typical kid
that curses only for laughs&#x97;she can kick your arse twelve times before
you hit the ground. Its tough to make an audience convicted that a
child can perform such maneuvers, but Kick-Ass pulls it off without
breaking a single sweat.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn is a much underrated director, but if he doesn&#x27;t get any
special love for his directing here, then I give up on critics
nationwide. He directs this with such glee, such precision and such
talent, the entire comic book movie world should start taking notes.
The pacing is incredible, the surprises are well-hidden, and the action
sequences are edited so tightly, it was inches from perfection. The
fights and shootouts were brutal and didn&#x27;t pull any punches, as you
see blood, guts, and absolute mayhem right at your face. If the action
were any closer to you, you&#x27;d walk out of the theater with burn marks
and eternal scars.<br /><br />Kick-Ass succeeds as a great movie because it gleefully parodies,
references, and imitates comic book movies of the past and the present.
Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, and even Sin City had their small moments
to shine as all of the characters going to the high school mention,
read, talk about, and criticize comic book characters. This is a
fanboy&#x27;s movie, no question about it. Kick-Ass never tries to appeal to
the mainstream, instead aims and hits the target at entertaining those
in love with flipping to the next page to see the next comic panel. No
PG-13 carnage here, you&#x27;ll get all the blood, violence, sex, and humor
that&#x27;s usually in the bookstores but rarely is on-screen nowadays.
You&#x27;ll feel every punch, shot, and crushing blow---and you are going to
love it.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Kick-Ass is kick ass. I know everyone is going to say the
same thing from here on out, it&#x27;s far too easy a compliment to give it.
But, there&#x27;s no other way to describe the 110 minutes. If you want a
deeper explanation, we have a blend of good writing, good acting, good
dosage of action, and good dosage of emotion, good directing, good
pacing, and enough entertainment to cover the last couple comic book
movie disappointments. Nicholas Cage is forgiven for Ghost Rider (not
yet for Bangkok Dangerous&#x85;.not yet), and fanboys yet again can flock to
the theaters to see a film that was made strictly for them---much like
Zombieland last year. Recommend to anyone that likes comics---new or
old.
