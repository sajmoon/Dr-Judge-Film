I thought this movie was going to be great but was sadly mistaken. I
could not tell you how angry this movie made me. I wanted to turn it
off at least 3 different times. Instead I ended up fast forwarding it.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of my thoughts:<br /><br />Unbelievable. (x2)<br /><br />You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me.<br /><br />What a piece of $#@!. (x2)<br /><br />Absolute garbage.<br /><br />Have you ever seen those Japanese robots? The ones that can express
emotions almost exactly like humans? Well I say almost because they can
never get it right, &#x26; probably never will. No matter how good CGI gets
or how good robots become there will always be something missing. A
soul. Nowadays it&#x27;s hard to tell actors apart from those Japanese
robots. I blame this on Disney. Yes, Disney-style acting has got to be
the worst, most artificial acting on the planet. Actors are encouraged
to smile &#x26; talk in ways that they never would in real life. In short;
they lack authenticity. To see a good example of this watch Cory in the
house, or Hannah Montana. All they do is smile &#x26; move their !@#$in
eyebrows! They can&#x27;t act for sh!t &#x26; it pisses me off! This Disney-style
acting has becoming increasingly popular &#x26; hard to spot, but if you
wanna see a prime example of someone who uses it watch
RayWilliamJohnson on Utube. His facial expressions kill me! I&#x27;m sick of
these know-nothing people making it big. Not just the actors but the
entire crew-set. Everyone involved with this POS! The dialogue wasn&#x27;t
even funny or smart. It seems like they&#x27;re using the excuse that this
was based on a comic-book, for the overall lack-of-skill displayed
throughout. Sadly this isn&#x27;t simply commentary on a movie or genre, but
the continued downward spiral of America &#x26; it&#x27;s cinema. I don&#x27;t believe
in god but after this can&#x27;t help but ask; Why in God&#x27;s name was this
made?
