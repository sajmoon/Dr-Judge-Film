No!... Then you haven&#x27;t seen Kick-Ass.<br /><br />Watching this film is like getting a legal high. It will have an
amazing effect on you physiologically. After you have watched it for
the first time, you immediately want to watch it again. It will become
addictive, you will get withdrawal symptoms if you go more than two
days without your Kick-Ass fix.<br /><br />I have never before seen a movie that has such an effect on you.<br /><br />Why didn&#x27;t you go to the theatre to watch it? Probably because you
watched the trailer and thought it was a lame superhero movie and will
wait to rent it on DVD. BIG MISTAKE.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.<br /><br />The trailer gives no clue about the emotional and adrenaline pumping
experience you will get when you watch this film. By the end of the
movie you will be a quivering mess wondering what just hit you.<br /><br />All the performances are outstanding and will no doubt receive a great
deal more offers based on their performances in this film.<br /><br />However there is one performance that has to be seen to be believed.
CHLOE MORETZ (11 years old at the time) plays Hit Girl. It is a
performance that takes this film from the great to the truly
unimaginably outstanding. When you watch her as either Mindy or Hit
Girl you are witnessing something special. Compare Chloe to most (if
not all) other Hollywood actors/actresses and you will see the
difference. She ACTUALLY BECOMES THAT CHARACTER on set. Almost like a
split-personality she actually seems to be able to completely block out
her own personality and project the character she is playing like
no-one else I have ever seen before. Watch her on the Tonight Show with
Jay Leno or on Ellen (both can be seen on youtube). Her charisma and
maturity at such a young age put most other so-called stars in the
shade. The many clips of Chloe that are available on youtube are a must
see. One of the best is the Hit Girl interview she does for Empire
magazine on set in her Hit Girl outfit. Watch and while bearing in mind
that she was 11 at the time prepare to be blown away.
