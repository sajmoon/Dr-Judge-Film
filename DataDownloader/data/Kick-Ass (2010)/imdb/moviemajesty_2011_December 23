Kick-Ass is bloody, funny, original, and everything you could want in
an action-comedy. Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a high school loser who
decides to become a superhero, aka Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson had a
terrific performance and really nailed the character. He was nerdy and
just a loser in general, and was so funny when he was using his little
batons. The other standout performance was by Chloe Moretz, who plays
the foul- mouthed Hit-Girl. Her father, aka Big-Daddy played by
Nicholas Cage, has been training her to shoot guns, use crazy knife
weapons, and just kill people. Chloe Moretz is definitely a young
actress to keep an eye on; I read that she went to circus school to
train for her role. Overall, this movie is fresh with some awesome
action scenes that will make you wanting more. If there is a part 2,
you can bet that I will be first in line to see it.
