I had only seen the trailers leading into this movie. When I mentioned
to my wife that I was going to go to a morning showing of this she
surprised me by saying she wanted to go too. I told her it was violent,
and she said that was okay.<br /><br />We went and both really enjoyed the movie. It&#x27;s funny and the plot is
pleasantly twisty. The violence is there, and there&#x27;s plenty of blood
and beatings, but not as bad as the last violent movie I saw, Watchmen
(also good). Hit Girl steals the show and the bad guys are entertaining
and have some great lines.<br /><br />On the other hand if you go to a movie actually titled KICK ASS and are
offended by the violence - that&#x27;s all on you, sorry.
