One of the best movies I have seen in probably 2 years. In the end I
truly did like it more than Avatar.<br /><br />The best part is I really did not know what was going to happen at
every pivotal point in the movie. I won&#x27;t get into any spoilers but you
know some movies (IE. Green Zone) where you probably could script out
the way the entire movie would play out after the first 20 minutes....
lets just say I did not know what would happen right down to the final
scenes.<br /><br />It is brutally violent and at the same time funny, seamlessly
transitioning back and forth maintaining just enough humour to dictate
the overall feel of the film into a .... not quite happy but certainly
lighter tone. It&#x27;s important they did that for it was a truly serious
movie people would over analyze the hell out of it.<br /><br />The actors were amazingly well cast and as many reviewers have already
stated, they are really people you can emphasize with or at least
relate to. The bad guys are actually seriously bad dudes.... its not a
film in which the bad guys are just stupid and really not so bad in the
end (IE. brutal Spider Man films)..... no they are actually kinda smart
and people that will torture, kill, maim etc... Nicholas Cage as Big
Daddy has his best role since his glory days of Face Off, Con Air, and
The Rock.<br /><br />Action scenes are incredible with three in particular.... The first
major Kick Ass fight, Big Daddy&#x27;s fight, and well several of Hit Girls
with one in particular that you will know when you see it.<br /><br />Its a full length two hour movie and honestly you wish it could have
been 3 hours long because the script and story just meshed that well.
Lots of action, lots of humor, good guys you really like and bad guys
that are just as hilarious in their own brutal way.<br /><br />A funny/serious action movie with a plot like no movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.
Go see it.
