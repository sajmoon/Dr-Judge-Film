As a Marvel comic geek, you know what to expect in graphic books such
as characters saving the world and defeating the bad guys, who sometime
in most stories always gets the girl. But when a Marvel comic book gets
turn into a live-action superflick movie, it gets a PG-13 rating right?
Well all of them do....expect for one.<br /><br />That tile I would highly called is Kick-Ass. Why? Because not only does
the hero kicks the bad boys&#x27; asses, he also gets his own ass kicked
too. (So you can see why they gave it such a funny title lol)<br /><br />Based off the 2008 comics by Mark Millar, Kick-Ass tells the story
about a high school kid named Dave who dreams about being a superhero,
but it&#x27;s not an easy job to do it. But once he does, he inspires
others. Those others such as a father and a daughter named Damon and
Mindy, who take up the names of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, along with a
kid around Dave&#x27;s age named Chris who becomes Red Mist, but he isn&#x27;t
all what he appears to be.<br /><br />As the movie-going fans, we all love watching a good superheroes
fighting crime and busting villains. But why can&#x27;t we have those in
real life?<br /><br />The creator&#x27;s idea for Kick-Ass is quickly clever for coming up with an
idea like that. Besides all of the action, and the blood gory fighting
sequences, you would think that after seeing this movie, you were gonna
wish you turn into a superhero yourself.<br /><br />But it is not your average hero movie so it gets an R rating because of
the strong language and the extremely hard-gore battling parts. So if
you&#x27;re used to watching highly gun-shooting-saving-the-world or comedy
movies, then Kick-Ass is the perfect time to go see it.
