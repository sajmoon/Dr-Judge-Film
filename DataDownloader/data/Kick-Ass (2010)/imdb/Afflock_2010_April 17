The naysayers missed the point and context. This movie is NOT for kids,
the R-Rating is proof enough. <br /><br />Hit Girl is an awesome movie.. er... I mean Kick-Ass. The positive
comments say it all. Well done film that gets so much right that it is
easy to overlook the very few minor flaws. It is based on a comic book,
so some artistic liberty is allowed, yes? <br /><br />The character Kick-Ass is well developed and is the one person who ties
the whole movie together. The main storyline is more about Hit Girl and
Big Daddy. The theme is created by Kick-Ass and his vision of people
standing up for what is right. The movie has a noticeable Tarrentino
influence. It does quote other movies and mocks it in a dead pan style
that does not say, &#x22;hey we are mocking this film now&#x22;. You have to
catch the references. <br /><br />Was a little disappointed in the turn out on a Saturday night of the
opening weekend. Probably 60 people in a 850 capacity theatre. It may
be a late bloomer or a sleeper in the theatres. It is worth seeing on
the big screen. Very entertaining and has some good funny moments.
There are a few jaw dropping moments when you say, &#x22;no they did not
just do that&#x22;. It has a few surprises that will make you laugh or
cringe and chuckle. The few obvious set ups on what will happen next
won&#x27;t make you feel disappointed (oh boy that was predictable), but you
will find yourself wanting to see how it turns out and anticipating the
next scene or twist. <br /><br />Well done with good chemistry among the cast. The tempo, editing,
cinematography, writing, and directing mixed very well together. It is
one of the better films, technically speaking, that has been out in a
while. <br /><br />The first 15 min of character development pays off in the last 30
minutes of the film. It makes you cheer for the main characters. The
sound track makes it fun. The ending does set it up for a potential
sequel, but not in an annoying way, the plot lines are all tied up.
Normally I would not see a movie twice, but this one would be good to
see with a group of people. It will be fun to discuss afterwords over
dinner or coffee. <br /><br />See the film and decide for yourself. Don&#x27;t take the kids. Bring
friends.
