Kick-Ass (1:58, R) &#x97; Fantasy: Comics &#x26; Pulps, 2nd string, crossover<br /><br />The producers of Kick-Ass have a particular audience in mind &#x97; genus
Fanboius, species komicbukii &#x97; and since I am a prime specimen of their
intended target, I am pleased to say that they got me dead center with
both barrels ... and also several knives, a stun gun, a few grenades,
several well placed fists to the head and kicks to the groin, and a
bazooka.<br /><br />This flick is a total trip from beginning to end. It gets the
comic-book feel just right, doesn&#x27;t wuss out by pulling any punches in
the brutality department, is extremely well paced, keeps you guessing
as to where it&#x27;s going (a plus in my book), and features snappy,
realistic dialog. Plus which, it&#x27;s got more than its fair share of
laff-out-loud moments.<br /><br />We open with a voice-over from average high-schooler Dave Lizewski
(Aaron Johnson), musing &#x22;I always wondered why nobody ever did it
before me.&#x22; as we see a cloaked figure spread his costume wings and
plummet from the top of a tall building as the citizens below gape up
in awe. Up to that point, Dave has been one of the faceless masses,
lamenting &#x22;My only superpower was being invisible to girls.&#x22;.<br /><br />That&#x27;s about to change, tho, as he decides he doesn&#x27;t need superpowers
to don a costume (a customized scuba wetsuit) and fight crime with only
his bare hands, a brace of martial-arts batons, a taser, and &#x22;a perfect
combination of optimism and naivet&#xE9;&#x22;. His 1st encounter in the heroic
persona of Kick-Ass does not turn out well, however. But after they get
done patching him back together, he&#x27;s got lots of metal parts and enuf
nerve damage to render him largely indifferent to pain. Thus his next
big fight, defending a mugging victim against 3 thugs, works out
somewhat better, tho he still takes a beating. But this time it&#x27;s been
captured on multiple cell-phone cameras and soon becomes an internet
sensation.<br /><br />As it turns out, somebody else DID hit on this idea before Dave did,
somebody who does a much better Batman imitation while leaving
virtually no traces of who he is. That would be ex-con (and framed
ex-cop) Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage, even quirkier than usual but
highly effective as such), who goes by the nom de guerre Big Daddy. Oh,
yeah, and then there&#x27;s Big Daddy&#x27;s little girl (literally a girl, about
age 11) Mindy (Chloe Moretz), AKA Hit- Girl, who&#x27;s quicker than a
cobra, nimbler than an Olympic gymnast, less remorseful than a pit
bull, and cuter than a litter of cocker spaniel puppies when she wants
to be.<br /><br />Crime lord Frank D&#x27;Amico (the scarily effective Mark Strong) knows that
somebody&#x27;s been knocking over his drug deals and taking out his goons,
but he doesn&#x27;t believe the screaming pleas of his soon-to-be-ex
henchmen that it was some kind of costumed vigilante. At least, he
doesn&#x27;t give it much credence until he sees the video of Kick-Ass,
after which he figures he&#x27;s identified his nemesis and orders his
entire mob to track down and kill the costumed idiot.<br /><br />He&#x27;s wrong, of course, it&#x27;s been BD and HG (to quote their belt
buckles) all along. However bold his attitude, Dave is still physically
ineffectual (tho his love life is perking up a bit), but now he&#x27;s a
target. BD and HG effortlessly track him down, warn him how easy it was
and what he&#x27;s up against, and offer help if he really needs it.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, another offer of assistance comes from a new
costumed crime-fighter, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, trying hard
to overcome the McLovin stereotype), but there&#x27;s something a little
hinky going on here.<br /><br />This movie is rated R and deserves it. It has no campy bam-biff-pow
scenes, but there are blood, cruelty, and corpses galore. The crooks
are played as total hard-asses. And yet there are funny scenes that
don&#x27;t cut the mood. Really, this is an amazing balancing act, but
nobody ever steps off that thin little wire.<br /><br />It&#x27;s clearly not a movie for everyone, but I thot it rocked, and what
you get is my highly personal but totally honest opinion: dandy!
