A nerdy boy becomes a super hero who first get his ass kicked and then
kicks some bad boys ass. Which in itself isn&#x27;t so new but this movie
has a few twist to make it interesting.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a nothing guy who has a hard time
getting any attention in school. One day he decides to buy a super hero
costume off the internet and dubs himself Kick Ass. His first attempts
at being a hero are absolutely inept but he gets the local media
attention and Kick Ass becomes a well known man about town. He stumbles
upon a father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage) daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz)
super hero team who are after the towns bad man(Mark Strong).<br /><br />This movie is extremely violent the way Robocop was, but here most of
the violence is done by 11 year old Hit Girl. The movie does get
clich&#xE9;d in parts and the beginning is a little slow but once this movie
gets going it&#x27;s a real ride. B+
