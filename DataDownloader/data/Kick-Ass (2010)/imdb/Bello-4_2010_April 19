2010_April 19 
Like many I presume, after seeing the commercials and being dazzled by
the bright colors and the pint-sized superhero I&#x27;d later learn was
called Hit Girl I thought that this was perhaps a children&#x27;s movie. But
don&#x27;t be fooled, Kick Ass is anything but for the young kids. This is a
teen and grown up movie and should be regarded as such for the language
and extreme violence.<br /><br />I really found Kick Ass to be an enjoyable movie. It held itself
together reasonable well and I found little that I would&#x27;ve done
differently. Mainly just toning down the most extreme violence and the
sexual innuendos neither of which is my thing, and particularly the
later I found myself squirming in the theater seat and wondering if I
was the only one that felt both uncomfortable and like I was watching a
throw back to the 80&#x27;s when movies had that level of cheap sexual
thrills.<br /><br />It was really entertaining watching our main protagonist, Dave Lizewski
(Aaron Johnson), think he had what it took to become a superhero. Now I
guess we know why most all superheroes have powers, some kind of
ability or a gimmick. Generally speaking, they&#x27;d get their butt kicked
if they didn&#x27;t. While the movie started somewhat slow, and you perhaps
couldn&#x27;t help but roll your eyes at Dave&#x27;s really cheesy superhero
costume it was humorous to see him try and step up.<br /><br />But it&#x27;s really Hit Girl (played by Chloe Grace Moretz) that just runs
with the movie. Being swept up into the larger story of the running
conflict between Hit Girl, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and big bad Frank
D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong) you really get the sense that Dave &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;
Lizewski doesn&#x27;t know what he got himself into and definitely didn&#x27;t
sign up for the events of the movie; but nevertheless does the right
thing by the later part of the movie. The characters of Hit Girl and
her father, Big Daddy, take themselves and what they do very seriously.
And it&#x27;s once they appear that the movie really takes on a new life and
moves past being perhaps just a cheesy flick. It&#x27;s the later story,
involving these two that holds the entire movie together.<br /><br />With all going on in this movie, the extreme violence, the sexual
innuendos, the perhaps question of is this a movie being marketed at
kids to young (reference the colors) and whatever else I find it funny
that critics take exception with the foul language (and one word in
particular) uttered by the Hit Girl character. With everything else
going on a single word is what the critics focus on? Perhaps they
could&#x27;ve cleaned up her language some but they didn&#x27;t have anything
else to say about the movie? Chloe Grace Moretz will be known for this
movie. She will undoubtedly go on to a great career in movies if he
continues barring a really bad bomb of a future film. Perhaps I&#x27;m not
alone in thinking that a Hit Girl centered movie would be a great idea,
but would it be a sequel or a prequel? (I&#x27;d vote for either) The
problem though (and probably why you&#x27;d have to go with a sequel) is
that Ms. Moretz made this film almost two years ago when she was only
eleven, and as seen most recently on the Tonight Show plugging this
movie, now at age thirteen she&#x27;s really grown and changed from her
character Mindy &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; MacReady. I applaud her for being a child
star but wanting to skip the age appropriate, pop-corn fluff that is
usually written for children and saying to the motion picture industry
that kids and do action also.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with this movie was Katie, Dave&#x27;s crush and
ultimately to become his girlfriend. From crush to girlfriend is fine.
But she sends Kick Ass to talk some sense into gang members causing her
trouble and they don&#x27;t explain how an innocent enough looking girl has
some kind of relationship with a den of drug dealing gang members? Talk
about a hole in your script and a lack of detail.<br /><br />KB
