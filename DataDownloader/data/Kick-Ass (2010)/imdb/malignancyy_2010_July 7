I would never have expected this movie to be so good. The comedy and
action was just spot on. It was not one of those movies where they try
to incorporate some comedy and it is just cheesy and diminishes the
movies potential. They use comedy where proper to enhance the movie,
and a lot of it. I would go as far as to say they blended it well as
Shaun of the Dead. The plot of the movie was also great. The way the
stories linked together was great and simple (had they tried something
complex like in Crash or Traffic it would have not fit). The movie used
clich&#xE9; superhero and action themes and events, but it definitely put
its own twist on them. Although this movie does NOT deserve to be in
the top 200, it is great. I think that it is just the kind of movie
that many people who review here on IMDb like. I give it a 8.0/10.
