The 18 birthday of a boy. The festive atmosphere, the waiting of gifts
are absent. The problem of Emo is a competition with his friends for an
amplified station. In same time, the indifference of parents for him is
occasion of deep sadness. So, only friend is the Red Mist .<br /><br />His fate gives to him the desired station and a purple jumpsuit, for
short time, the happy atmosphere is coming. But it is only a moment.
The station is open and Dave assists at his parents quarrel. The
elements of married crisis are unveils to boy who discovers an ugly
reality of hard form of intolerance. His world becomes ambiguous space
of feelings and desire. The values are illusions, the family- a cage.<br /><br />&#x22;Kiss-Ass&#x22; is not a great movie. It is not beautiful or interesting and
the excess of eloquence is, in same moments, boring.<br /><br />And yet, it is one of my least favorites movies. At first for the
subtle acting of three important Emo actors: Christopher Mintz-Plasse,
Clark Duke and Aaron Johnson and for the identification with Dave
Lizewski&#x27;s character. Then, for the image of capital error who move the
aspect of life. Then for the small similitude with Redford&#x27;s &#x22;Ordinary
people&#x22;. At last, for the interesting image of life like fight between
incapacity of empathy and hope of child.<br /><br />In fact,the film is a collection of aphorisms but that is not very
important.<br /><br />It is result of a Capitalist vision, with priggishness address.<br /><br />It is a moral lesson but, more important, like any experience, is a
trip to self-knowledge. So, may be a personal masterpiece, eventually.
And that is his fundamental value.
