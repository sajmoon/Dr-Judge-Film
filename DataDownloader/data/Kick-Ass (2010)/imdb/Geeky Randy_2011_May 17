Adaptation of 2008 creator-owned comic book of the same name, about a
teenage boy (Johnson) who sets out to become a superhero. His actions
are caught on camera, via witnesses&#x27; cellphones, and uploaded onto the
internet, making him an inspiration. However, he soon gets pushed into
the crossfire of an ongoing war between gangsters and ruthless
vigilantes that are killing the thugs off one by one. The film starts
out very promising, with real life obstacles as a major (and many times
humorous) setback for the main character. However, what starts out as
something comical and self-aware soon turns into a heartless tale of
vigilantism. It&#x27;s pretty much Marvel&#x27;s answer to Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
Batman Trilogy, but it brings nothing new to heroism in the real world.
The film soon begins focusing too much on the violence and cruelty of
the world, rather than focusing on the main character&#x27;s realization of
why people choose not to become superheroes in the real world--an
epiphany brought on by a more interesting sub-plot involving a crush
who thinks he&#x27;s gay. Still, the film hit the right spot for a lot of
people, but not everyone. Just another example of why Marvel is
inferior and shallow compared to DC.<br /><br />*&#xBD; (out of four)
