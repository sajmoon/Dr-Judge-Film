It was a virtual certainty, just like Joker said that Gotham will never
be the same again, because Batman had changed everything forever by
showing Gotham the true colours of the criminals, by the same token,
Chris Nolan with his Dark Knight has changed forever how we view super
heroes, by showing us the true colours of other super heroes and how
hilarious they have been so far, not to say sorry excuses at being
called movies.<br /><br />And the result is Kick-Ass. Raw, dark, terrifyingly enjoyable and above
all action packed with lots of blood and gory. In fact, the rawness of
the movie may even be found offending and objectionable to the old
school movie goers. <br /><br />This movie is not a superhero movie that you watch with your children.
It will not make you laugh (although there are some funny scenes),
because it is not meant to make you laugh. It is not meant to be a
Superman or Spiderman type of super hero movie too. It is something
else, something of its own kind, unique even. Maybe, it has created its
own genre... so that, when a movie like this is made again, we can say
that its &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; type. <br /><br />My advise, and this is from someone who has watched many movies of all
genres over the years, if you like superhero movies, please don&#x27;t watch
Kick-Ass, because after watching it you can never go back and watch
those movies again. You will find them funny at least, and irritating
at worst. But if you are willing to cross your frontiers and watch
something which will leave you short of words when you&#x27;re done, gasping
for breath, sweating, adrenaline pumping...then my advise: watch
it...and tell the others who are as crazy as us....
