I am not usually disgusted by graphic violence, and find it
entertaining when it serves a purpose on horror films\black comedy.
However, Kick Ass is void of any purpose or meaning. Sure it starts
promising like your classic superhero film, and it keeps your hopes up,
but by the end of it, you feel subtly cheated.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not saying all superficial movies are bad, but when you strip this
movie down to its core qualities, you will find naked violence with not
a shred of real humor, important storyline or memorable characters. In
a sense, it is a 2 hour pornographic celebration of death, lead by a
11-year old kid. <br /><br />If you want to destroy the last remnant of meaning in your life, this
movie is for you my friend!
