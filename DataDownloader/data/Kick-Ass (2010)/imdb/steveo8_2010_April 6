when i seen trailers for kick-ass i thought it was just the same old
run of the mill teen comedy with super hero twist i really thought it
was going to be a flop BUT due to the recent crappy weather i decided
to check it out and guess what i could not have been any more wrong
about the film.<br /><br />Kick-Ass starts of with Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) the typical
unnoticed high school comic geek who fantasises of becoming a super
hero. Dave sick of his unnoticed life decides to create an alter ego
called kick ass and with very little training kick ass heads out to
fight crime with positive and negative results on the positive side he
shoots to fame on the internet and the negative he gets his ass kicked
quite a lot.<br /><br />We are also introduced to characters such as son of a mob boss Chris
D&#x27;Amico / Red Mist or mc lovin to superbad fans (Christopher
Mintz-Plasse) who really shows he can act when hes given the chance and
crime fighting duo Mindy Macready / Hit-Girl and her father Damon
Macready / Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) in my mind one of Nicolas cages
better performances.<br /><br />my overall opinion is that kick ass is a truly great film it had the
right amount of style,action,comedy,good story progression,likable
characters which all together made a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />i simply cannot recommend this movie enough it really is a breath of
fresh air from the crap that cinemas have been showing recently.<br /><br />so if your looking to get ass kicked by a good movie kick ass is that
movie
