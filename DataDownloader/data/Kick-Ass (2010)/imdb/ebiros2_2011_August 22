We all have desire to be a hero. This movie takes it to the next level.<br /><br />A kid who&#x27;s a total nobody in high school decides to play his fantasy
out and buys a super hero costume. He then goes out playing the
vigilante on the streets for real. Soon he&#x27;s the most popular video on
YouTube. One night he runs into a real deal vigilante team that kills
off eight gangs in two minutes in front of his eyes and takes all the
drug money. The king pin thinks it&#x27;s Kick Ass who did it, and puts a
hit on him.<br /><br />Nick Cage plays the supporting role in this movie and he&#x27;s great. So is
Chloe Moritz as his daughter. <br /><br />The movie spoofs super hero genre in a good way. They play all the
funny situation to the hilt.<br /><br />In a way this movie was better than Spiderman. This movie definitely
kicks ass.
