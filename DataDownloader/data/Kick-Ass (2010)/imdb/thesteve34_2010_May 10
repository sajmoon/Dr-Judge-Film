When I first heard of the release of this film, I thought &#x22;Oh here we
go again, another teen comedy trying desperately to make audiences
laugh with it&#x27;s cheesy gags and stupid plot line&#x22;. I was expecting an
absolute nightmare; but I&#x27;ve never been so wrong. From start to finish,
it perfectly blends action, violence and satirical comedy all into one
nicely wrapped package, delivered first class. Mintz-Plasse, possibly
the tastiest sounding name in show business, gives a truly sublime
performance as the lead bumbling teenager who tries to become a super
hero in the modern world, without thinking of the consequences. Even
his co-stars, young Moretez and Cage sparkle as father and daughter;
with a infamous reference to Adam West&#x27;s classic Batman which he
depicts to perfection. Now, onto the violence. And my God, is it
violent. From a man being roasted in a fire alive, to a guy being blown
out of a building by a bazooka, it has absolutely everything for action
fans to feast they&#x27;re hungry eyes on. Seeing it&#x27;s blood thirsty nature,
you really do wonder why it&#x27;s certificated a fifteen, but then of
course, it&#x27;s not violence. It&#x27;s COMIC violence. Or that&#x27;s what it says
on the tin. This film is no Ronseal, as it goes into much darker issues
from just good vs. bad, appealing to a much wider audience. So what
have we learnt? That anyone can be a super hero? No. This film is
simply fantasy in the real world, with it&#x27;s tongue in cheek humour and
extremely graphic fighting scenes, it delivers a thrill ride that
teeters on the edge of over the top. Just want we to see. Kicks Ass.
Literally.
