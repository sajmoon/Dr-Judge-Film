I have been looking forward to kick-ass for a while. I actually heard
of it because I am a Nic Cage fan. After reading reviews and watching
trailers, I had no idea what to expect. I either thought it was going
to be a total comedy or an obscene, vulgar, no-plot movie. It&#x27;s
actually a little of both. Kick-Ass has the perfect mix between a
&#x22;superhero&#x22; flick and a comedy. It is pretty controversial, but I would
expect nothing less. The story was the biggest surprise to me. This
movie had a WONDERFUL story. It made me laugh and almost cry in parts.
The directors also added some comedy into the most brutal scenes to
keep them from being too harsh. Nic Cage is not himself at all in this
movie. Most people will probably enjoy this. Aaron Johnson, to me, was
alright (not perfect) but his quirkiness was quite charming. Mark
Strong was a very cynical actor. I could keep going down the list, but
Chloe Moretz stole the show. She was FANTASTIC. Overall the acting was
stupendous. Kick-Ass just did everything right. Even the music made for
a fun experience (The Banana Splits and Spaghetti Western music) was
very fun during gory battles. This movie is also one that rarely drug.
Most movies have that &#x22;middle-section&#x22; that just makes the viewer want
to gouge out his or her eyes. Not here. Overall, if you can take some
gore and cussing, and are looking for fun; SEE THIS MOVIE. The end.
10/10
