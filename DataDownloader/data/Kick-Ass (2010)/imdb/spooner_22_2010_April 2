2010_April 2 
Went to see this the other day after months and months of waiting...I
had wanted to see this since the first time I read anything about it. I
had it hyped up big time in my own mind, especially after seeing the
amazing reviews that it had already got on IMDb.<br /><br />I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that I was not disappointed by this
film. I loved it. Kick-ass is a great character and is played well by
Aaron Johnson. Christopher Mintze=Plasse was great as Red Mist and I
didn&#x27;t think about &#x27;McLovin&#x27; at all when watching him. Chloe Moretz is
a great young actress and her portrayal of Hit Girl was just amazing!
But my personal favourite character was Big Daddy...Nic Cage was
wonderful in this film...right down to the way he spoke like Adam
West&#x27;s Batman when he was dressed as Big Daddy. Brilliant.<br /><br />The film plot was great too, we all want to be a super-hero right?? I
know I have thought it at some point! This film takes that and puts it
into a reality...well, in a movie, but you know what I mean. The actors
played their roles really well, the young ones still acted like they
were young even when they were trying to kill bad guys...showing fear
at times and being strong when they needed to be.<br /><br />The only problems I had with this film...I had hyped it too much in my
mind, sometimes the soundtrack didn&#x27;t work with certain scenes of the
movie and at times it was a little slow paced for my liking...but that
didn&#x27;t take away from how great this was.<br /><br />All in all this is the best film of the year so far. And in reply to my
original title...is the the greatest super-hero movie ever?? I would
have to say...yes, it probably is!
