I have a theory why some critics have given this movie such a low
rating and it has nothing to do with the age of the actors.<br /><br />Liberals all over the world despise the gun culture in the US because
it is against government control. Most liberals have a knee-jerk
reaction to anything that promotes guns. I think one of the reasons
some critics are trashing this movie is because it has a lot gun
violence and it is completely unapologetic about it.<br /><br />The directors of this movie were obviously not concerned about
political correctness, which is why it is so good. &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22; and &#x22;Hit
Girl&#x22; love their guns. Even worse, they show absolutely no remorse for
brutally killing bad guys with those guns. Ebert said it was ridiculous
how &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; and &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22; showed no remorse after killing
criminals. That&#x27;s a valid point. But in a funny way that&#x27;s exactly what
makes their characters so compelling. They are not bleeding-heart
liberals who cry every time a brutal criminal is killed. They know
their victims are evil and they are determined to make them pay for
their crimes. How refreshing.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is also a very compelling character. One of the best parts
of the movie is when a criminal asks him, &#x22;Kid, are you ready to die
for this stranger?&#x22; Kick-Ass answers, &#x22;Yes, I am&#x22;. Kick-Ass loves
justice so much that he is ready to sacrifice his own life to achieve
it. Unlike other celebrities who become famous because of their
appearance and talent, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; becomes famous because of his
self-sacrifice. <br /><br />I understand that Kick-Ass is a parody of superhero movies, just like
Kill Bill was a parody of 70&#x27;s Kung-Fu movies. But even though these
movies are laughing at some of the more absurd aspects of the genres
they are parodying, they are also celebrating their themes. Even though
the characters in Kick-Ass are absurd, and maybe even a little crazy,
they still have all those characteristics that makes us want to be
superheroes ourselves: a determination to punish evil, an unhesitating
commitment to justice, and a willingness to sacrifice themselves for
the greater good.
