2010_April 19 
I went into the cinema with a very pessimistic attitude towards this
film. Having been a fan of the comic for a good hour (I read the comic
just before I went to watch it), I had a lot of doubts about the cast
choices and the plot variations that the film makers would have had to
make. nguage or you lack a sense of humour Boy was I wrong. Kick-Ass is
one hundred per-cent cinematic gold, and I class myself as having very
good taste in film. You will only be disappointed by this film if you
do not like violence, bad language or you lack a sense of humour. I
will not give away too much of the film but all of the actors are
great, and I mean all of them. The script is fresh, funny and engaging.
The action is impeccable. The music choices for the film were inspired
and worked incredibly well. I honestly cannot find any flaws with this
film at all.<br /><br />Go and see it, it will blow you away.
