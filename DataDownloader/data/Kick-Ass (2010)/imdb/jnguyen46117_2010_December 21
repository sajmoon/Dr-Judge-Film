Dave is a loser with a nerdy comicy brain. No one knew him at his
school and his friends are just a bunch of losers. One day he saw a guy
being beat up by a bunch of thugs and decided to jump in a help with
his superhero costume. The video was captured and became an internet
phenomenon. Everyone tried to figure out who was this guy and named his
Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass became a pop icon just in days. After hearing about
Kick-Ass, hit men Big Daddy &#x26; Hit Girl decided to go after him to join
him with their group. Going through lots of violence and profanity,
Kick-Ass finally got that these two don&#x27;t kid around. They kill
mercilessly, they enjoy taking lives, and they cuss like a bunch of New
Yorkers. Kick-Ass is a refreshingly new film that adds to the
comic-action-films genre. Kudos to strong performances from crazyass
Nicolas Cage and the fouled-mouth Chloe Moretz. OscarBuzz: Long shots
