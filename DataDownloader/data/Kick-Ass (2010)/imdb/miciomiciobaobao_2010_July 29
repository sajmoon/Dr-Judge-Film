2010_July 29 
I loved it.<br /><br />All I knew before watching it was that it had something to do with
normal people trying to be superheros (I usually try not to even watch
the trailers so that they don&#x27;t influence me and they don&#x27;t make me
expect more than what the movie has to offer).<br /><br />I think about this movie as follows: take Watchmen, do a
low-cgi-version out of it, mix to it a few pieces of American Pie, add
how you would try to behave when being a superhero plus some bloody
Tarantino-shots for one of the characters, contour the whole with some
interesting music and you&#x27;ve got the movie.<br /><br />It was like with Zombieland - in both cases I expected a quite bad
movie, but in the end they were quite good, not serious, with a story
that unfolded without any problems, nice camera shots, nice music, good
actors, happy feeling at the end - a profiled movie. Not one of those
that mix everything trying to be OK for every kind of public.<br /><br />As I always doubt if the person who wrote the review has the same taste
that I have, here are a few more or less recent movies I liked:
Watchmen, The girl with the dragon tattoo, Let the right one in, Frost
nixon, Zombieland, Children of men, Gone baby gone, Snatch. This of
course excludes older ones, even classics like 2001 Space odyssey or
Seven samurai.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does his job - not more and not less. Chapeau. The little
girl (Chloe Moretz) is great, probably the best character in the movie.
The main actor (Aaron Johnson) was in my opinion flat. He could have
been a bit better. The bad guy(s) fit well in their roles.<br /><br />10 out of 10 would have been with a better main character and towards
the end a badder bad character.
