2010_April 19 
As a child, I fell into the pools of imagination pouring from
illustrated pages that gripped me with tales of suspense and drama,
holding me tight to the legacy of heroes and villains, and feeding the
fires flickering deep within my heart, and I dreamed of becoming a
super hero. But such dreams do not exist in this world, and our burden,
our cry for justice falls on the shoulders of men and women struggling
to keep us from slipping over that edge. And the rest of us hide behind
glass windows, watching the dark side of life play out over the street,
and we hope and pray for Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, or even the
Boondock Saints to rescue us from the real villains that live today.
But such thoughts are nothing more than a dream, and we remain locked
behind walls of fear, trying to survive another ordinary day. But what
if we dared take the mantle of the legends ignited through fiction and
step forth from those pages to change the world? Was it a foolish
child&#x27;s wish to fight for justice, and would we wind up being beaten
and left for dead? Or would our bravery light the stars of inspiration,
bringing others to rise and fight for a world toppling over darkness,
and would we then see the true definition of heroes, those willing to
risk all to silence the ones bent on power? But what sacrifice would
they make for us, and would our burden be too great, pressing down upon
innocent shoulders? And once innocence breaks, the steel of vengeance
is swift, merciless, and the streets will run red, bleeding into the
heart of justice. But what life would be left to live? Is this the
curse of one wishing to become a hero, and would it be better to remain
just dreaming this dream? But if we don&#x27;t fight, who would fight for
us, and what world would thrive beyond this cold, glass window?
