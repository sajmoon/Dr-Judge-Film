Chloe Moretz is exceptional as Hit Girl. Frankly they mis labelled the
film. She has the chutzpah of Hermione in the Harry Potter films, with
serious attitude and moves to boot.<br /><br />She makes Angelina Jolie / Lara Croft look, dare I say it, old and
slow.<br /><br />It&#x27;s really her film, and appropriate that the A-list talent, Nicolas
Cage, plays her father, not the &#x27;hero&#x27;s&#x27;.<br /><br />It&#x27;s remarkable that the film scores so highly, and a tribute to its
peak moments, because the general pacing makes Hannah Montana look racy
- long long long voice-over throughout the movie.<br /><br />We got it, gawky teen, can we move on please.<br /><br />Yeah, it&#x27;s good, in fact it&#x27;s very good, a bronze olympic medal, but it
could have been gold. Despite my title, Tomb Raider, and The Matrix -
for example - show true craftsmanship. This was highly watchable,
occasionally and momentarily brilliant, but in the end too much like
rehearsing lines, rather than delivering the play, or practising notes
rather than performing a song: snippets and hints of genius and beauty,
but too disjointed to leave you with the pleasure and after effect of a
a truly great movie.
