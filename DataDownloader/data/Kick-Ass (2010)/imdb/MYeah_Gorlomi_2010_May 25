The film is based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.
It centers on Dave Lizewski (Played by Aaron Johnson), a kid who lives
alone with his dad. In Dave&#x27;s home town, crime runs amok, and thievery
is everywhere you turn. So one day, Dave becomes a superhero. After a
brief, but disastrous attempt to stop two men from stealing a car, he
later saves a man&#x27;s life. He names his altar-ego, Kick-Ass. He later
meets Big Daddy (Played by Nicolas Cage), and Hit-Girl (Played by Chloe
Moretz). They are two people looking for revenge against a crime lord
named Frank D&#x27;Amico (Played by Mark Strong). Things get more
complicated for Dave, not only having to balance his life, and his
altar&#x27;s life, but dealing with a new superhero arriving on the scene
simply called Red Mist (Played by Christpher Mintz-Plasse), who is
actually Frank&#x27;s son in disguise.<br /><br />So, how do I describe this movie in four words, or less? Like this:
Kick-Ass, KICKED ASS.<br /><br />The story is brilliant, inspired, and wonderfully realistic. It doesn&#x27;t
suffer from, nor do I remember it having the typical clich&#xE9;s of a
normal superhero movie.<br /><br />So what about the performances? Excellent. Aaron Johnson was a great
lead performer. Christopher Mintz-Plasse played a great role. Mark
Strong, who seems to be typecast as villains, is pretty good with what
he has. Then there&#x27;s Nicolas Cage, who is stunning, and Chloe Moretz,
who is a great deal of fun to watch.<br /><br />And the action? Edge of your seat awesome. The action and fight scenes
are intense, gritty, and brutal. They have wonderful stunts, and
fantastic pacing and film editing. All year long you can expect me to
be singing the praises of Pietro Scalia, and his co-editors. <br /><br />The film is smart, hilarious, and thrilling to watch.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen this film yet, go. You won&#x27;t regret it.<br /><br />I give it *** out of ****.
