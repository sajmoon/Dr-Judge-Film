Producers, Media, Advertisers, Reviewers made us believe this movie was
good.<br /><br />Than it was 15 of us friends , off to the theater,(we usually go out in
group) 11 Hated it, 4 Loved it.<br /><br />So its a fact to say that 50% of the gross income world wide, were from
those people who were cheated into believing this was the summer movie
how many must have curse, fawned and praise <br /><br />Posters,ads says &#x22; excellence, marvelous, Funny, Hilarious.who are you
to decide, leave that to us.<br /><br />IMDb ratings i,ll always have my doubt<br /><br />Here&#x27;s an incident there were some families of course,one family in
particular a family of 5, father, mother, 2 son and a daughter
(sons-daughter, Age some roughly around 12-16) to my surprised i later
found them sitting in front of us.They looked a decent family Imagine
the horror, all those foul mouthed words and violence, gore, and
killing of people with out remorse or giving a second thought to it all
relating young teenagers Must have been a tough time for them.<br /><br />This was an adaption from a comic book not so famous in particular, if
you ask me and my believe if this is the case of comic book adaption
Unlike, Bat-man, superman, spidy, they all have a good purpose behind
violence and still they don&#x27;t manage to kill people.But in this case,
Parents might wanna buy them kids toys gun, in stead of comic like
this,Relating to violence and sexuality,keeping the movie aside alone. <br /><br />Who are this intended for Adult teenager or the usual young teens,well
then show them to your son and daughter first. Or are they intended for
Retards elders, retards necessarily doesn&#x27;t mean impaired minds
Definitely not for family or regulars adults , Let me make one point
Clear young and young one as a kids do use shitty language but they are
tend to learn violence, drinks,smoke and the definitive stuff relating
to that.... figured what i missed? so usually they are tend to love
movie like this....Because this is the age when they are most venerable <br /><br />That&#x27;s not the whole point lets say i am a retard adult, do i like the
movie let me put it this way ..the movie sucks the big time in my
opinion. lack of every thing except the(hit-girl and her daddy part)
which is the only reason i could bear through the movie and for the
sake of my friends.<br /><br />the only reason Massive teenagers and some adults could relate to this
movie is because Like teenagers losers,they could relate to the
character,with their sorry Ass life and fantasizing to improve their
life (which is not bad)and impress some chick they have a crushed on
but never dared.<br /><br />All in All the only high light of the movie was the (hit-girl and
big-daddy) and the whole movie lacked lots of creativity and
environment to it. <br /><br />If you think this movie was original and Had some thing NEW to Brag
about than check out this movie &#x22;DEFENDOR&#x22; more realistic and original
in plot and portrays a very real ordinary person in different sense who
decides to become a hero to protect the hood from vigilant ,when some
things went wrong.
