If you wanna here&#x27;s a review entered by an unlucky Italian who had to
go to England to watch this movie because in Italy it has not been
released yet (I think it won&#x27;t never be) because of the great costs.
Well, at first I&#x27;d say that in the last years I&#x27;ve always been let down
by a lot of movies which seemed quite interesting but which never
impressed me. Maybe because of trite plots, maybe because of the lost
passion for cinema of the directors whose interests concern just money,
because of the dammit sequels and so on... I was praying God for not
being let down even by this movie and...He realized my wish. OK, I&#x27;m
pretty mad I had been travelling for two hours by plane but...it was
WORTH! Then if I say so I think you have probably already understood
how I thought this movie was. The first thing that leaps to the eyes is
characters. I completely fell in love with Kick Ass, Hit Girl and
overall Red Mist (I could be gay for him lol). The plot, even if it
concerns a super-hero story, it&#x27;s different from the traditional ones
&#x27;cause here everything&#x27;s real (you may see youtube, played songs that
really exist in everyday life, and the REAL kick-ass comic book) and
it&#x27;s not so exaggerate as traditional ones: no superpowers, just the
normal strength of (quite) normal people. Special effects are worth of
a special mention overall for fighting scenes (I love Hit-Girl
&#x22;parkour&#x22; and her acrobatic actions). I am just disappointed because of
the fact that a lot of fantastic movies are often not published in many
countries and that&#x27;s a great pity. I won&#x27;t add anything more, I just
say if you haven&#x27;t watched it yet, DO IT!
