Not sure how this got good reviews, the acting was just pitiful and the
lines and storyline corny and just all over the place. The characters
were not well developed, the attempt at some kind of dark and subtle
humor came across more like a bunch of script writers who could not
come up with anything good. Not sure what Nicolas Cage was doing in
this movie, but he needs to stop making movies.<br /><br />They tried to pull off a kill bill type film but failed horribly. If
you are going to pay for a movie ticket just go see something else and
come in and watch the final fight scene with the little girl, that was
the only thing mildly entertaining and it only lasted about 10 minutes.
