2010_April 8 
I went to the cinema to see this film last night with my friends, and
to be honest we picked it because we turned up at the complex quite
late and this was the only showing we could see. But I love it when
this happens - you go to see a film you knew nothing about, and you
come out so grateful for having seen it! It was the funniest film I
have seen in ages. One of those films where the time literally whizzes
past because you&#x27;re enjoying it so much. Every scene was comic in one
way or another, and the action scenes were great. Not only did the film
contain comedy, action (including lots of violence and swearing) there
was also some emotional scenes in there, as well as a great deal of
teenage angst. Fab. Seeing it in a packed cinema was awesome as well,
as the whole cinema was either laughing together, or making noises such
as &#x27;oooh!&#x27; or &#x27;ouch!&#x27;. A great soundtrack, fantastic scripting and a
really original idea for a story. Go see this film!
