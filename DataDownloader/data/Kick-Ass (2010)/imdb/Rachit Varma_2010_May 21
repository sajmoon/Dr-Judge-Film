It is a superhero movie nothing like what you&#x27;ve ever seen before. It
has got no bulky, hoarse voiced macho men. Its got no super futuristic
weapons. The heroes don&#x27;t fly. In &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; what you end up seeing is
a bunch of kids who thrash real gangsters, and thrash them good. They
don&#x27;t care how old they are, they do what they need to do. Kick some
ass.<br /><br />This story is about Dave Lizewski(played by Aaaron Johnson), an average
high school kid, with very few friends, no skills to talk up a woman
and he even gets bullied by the other kids. But what he&#x27;s got is love
for comic books which when combined with building frustration over his
inability to do anything cool, can be quite, lame. He gets this stupid
gooey looking green colored costume and names himself Kick-Ass. He&#x27;s
got no style, no skills, but again, what he&#x27;s got is, is a good heart
and the will to do good things and not just stand and watch people do
wrong things. But while doing this he gets his ass kicked big time! He
looks like Ass-Kicked rather than Kick-Ass.<br /><br />But then come our real heroes. Damon Macready/Big Daddy(played by
Nicholas Cage) and Mindy Macready/Hit Girl(played superbly by Chloe
Moretz) are a father daughter duo who want to avenge the death of the
wife/mother and during that process make this world a better place.
Damon very calmly shoots at his daughter, who&#x27;s wearing a bulletproof
vest, just to prepare her if there ever is a situation like this in the
future. They play with guns and the girl knows inside out about glocks,
tommies, bazookas and what not. She plays with a knife as if its a
doll. She is this cute little 11 year old girl what when she gets down
to killing people, she can be mean. Now both of them see Kick-Ass
getting his ass kicked so they decide help him and form a sort of
alliance to fight crime.<br /><br />Now I won&#x27;t spill any more details out for you here, but will they be
able to defeat the gang-lord who caused Big Daddy to become a vigilante
in the first place? Will Kick-Ass finally get to be a hero? Will he get
the girl of his dreams? Watch to find out. Its a good entertaining
film, a refreshing watch. Its got a lot of disturbing images which
include a violent 11-year old girl hurling abuses at the bad guys and
using cuss words in general. All this might look a little disturbing to
the viewers and might send out the wrong message to kids everywhere.
But lets not worry about the kids as they are not supposed to watch an
R-rated film in the first place, so you can&#x27;t really blame the director
of the film. Its art. It&#x27;s meant to be subjective. It&#x27;s meant to
challenge the norms. But she has played the role of her life and she
looks to be a promising little actress who can really make it big in
the future. Nicholas Cage is finally acting his age by not being some
stupid burning bike-borne killer. The music just blows you away, with a
very unusual mix of classics and modern remixes which are put into the
scenes in a very effective manner which really jacks up the viewers
enthusiasm towards the particular scene and involves him. All in all a
good job by Matthew Vaughn who delivers another good product. I wonder
when will he get a good BO hit. Its his third movie which is
particularly good and interesting but like the other two this hasn&#x27;t
really garnered the money it deserves. I&#x27;ll be waiting for Kick-Ass 2.
