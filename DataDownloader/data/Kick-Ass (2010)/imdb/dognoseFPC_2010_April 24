I cannot stop thinking about it this movie. I am obsessed. I am going
to see it a third time this week.<br /><br />I saw the trailer for it in the theater, and my immediate reaction was
&#x22;No f---ing way am I seeing that.&#x22; It had the stench of teen comedy all
over it, and I hate teen comedies.<br /><br />Then the red band trailers sparked mild interest, but I cannot
recommend those to you because they are spoilerific. Then came the
early reviews from the UK, where it first opened, and they were quite
positive. Then, largely positive scores from the review sites. So I saw
it. I threw together a group of friends so that fun would be had no
matter whether the movie sucked or not. It did not suck.<br /><br />I remember the feeling I had after I saw Die Hard. Wholly unexpected
jubilation, and a strong desire to introduce others to a great film. I
haven&#x27;t experienced that feeling to that degree since. Until now.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t say much about the film itself or why it rocks so hard,
and you have seen too many spoilers as it is, if you have expressed any
interest at all. I will say that I want to give Nic Cage a hug. I will
also say that, when Arnold retired from action film, I wondered who the
next badass action hero would be. Duane &#x22;The Rock&#x22; Johnson? That was
everyone&#x27;s guess, but that didn&#x27;t happen. Jackie Chan wants to do drama
now. Jet Li is getting too old for wire work. Ray Stevenson was a great
Punisher, but approximately six people saw that wonderful movie.<br /><br />I never thought that my next action-hero badass idol would be a twelve
year old girl.<br /><br />The work of Macready/Moretz draws upon the speed and agility of Chan,
the wire work of Jet Li, the pistol-handling ability of Chow Yun-Fat,
the steely-eyed confidence of Clint Eastwood, and the relentless
determination of Arnold. All while smiling with glee, like... no action
hero I&#x27;ve ever seen before. I want more.<br /><br />Apparently I am not alone. In one of many positive reviews I&#x27;ve read,
the reviewer mentions going home and immediately putting Hit Girl
wallpaper on his computer. I did that too, and so will some of you I
bet. It&#x27;s not as creepy as you might think. You will understand if you
see the movie.<br /><br />This could just be honeymoon phase. Die-Hard has withstood the 20 year
test of time. So has Robocop, and so has Road Warrior. This film might
withstand that same time test, and it might not. But at this moment, it
is a favorite.<br /><br />It should be noted that all the casting is superb. Bravo to whoever did
the casting.<br /><br />I laughed, and I generally hate comedies. I cried, and I haven&#x27;t cried
in a movie theater since I saw Old Yeller as a kid.<br /><br />This film is not for everyone! It is not for the squeamish; there are
parts with a decent level of hack and slash violence. It is also NOT
FOR KIDS. As Moretz herself says in an interview I read, it is R rated
for a reason.

Thanks!
