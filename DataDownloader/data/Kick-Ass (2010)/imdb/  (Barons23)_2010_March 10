I had only seen one trailer before actually seeing Kick-Ass in its
entirety. The unknown in this situation turned out to be the greatest
asset in enjoying this film. The movie starts off a little slow, where
I actually found myself getting a little bored during the base
character development. Eventually I was able to relate to the
characters and become attached to the story line. Somewhere after the
first third of the film it begins to change its momentum. It began like
an indie film and finished like another installment in the Spiderman
series. I think the greatest appeal of this movie would be to not over
advertise and numb a very good film. I was lucky enough to see this
movie without any biases or judgments and the result was fantastic. I
left the theater looking forward to a sequel with only a few questions
on the ending of the movie, loose ends have always had a tendency to
frustrate me. In order to enjoy this film I would recommend seeing it
as soon as you can before any negative opinions can shadow an enjoyable
movie.
