Hey,i believe in the very EEC&#x27;s first entomb production,this highly
rioter litter might be mistaken for some like no innovation,anyhow on
the board it perchance could be,with stars like that jackass Nicolas
Cage &#x26; all or Mark Strong i guess what do you expect this crap to turn
on to ? Mat Vaugn was the producer of Guy Ritchie&#x27;s foremost movies
like Snatch or Lock,Stock &#x26; two smoking Barells and that Madonna
vanquish movie which was for the birds!alas now that he has gone same
by-way once Guy was going with Revolver and Swept Away.<br /><br />those catamite cadets wishing to be a superhero and the adventures to
take place in a weird fuc#ing way.now there&#x27;s no better way to
encourage the scenes of violence in kids by exhibiting this movie to
them . <br /><br />let us be honest to ourselves a bit,what precise purpose one director
or producer might have in his/her mind with such pandering spoiling
monkey business and dissemination of without a cause of violence?<br /><br />pardon my french roll writing manner,but American heroes from this Kick
Butt to Batman to Thor or what the Fuc# are Chaffey and asshole like
American society themselves.i have the knack of being such scurrilous
dick all the time,but it seems there is no boundary of personality
classifications in Hollywood.they made Kick-Ass for Youngsters.which
sucks.<br /><br />beats me the whole fidlle-faddle idea that in case of being an
action/comedy/thriller type,why i am not aware of no sign of below
listed aspects?<br /><br />tell me where&#x27;s the beef?Hollywood is drowning into ordure any
minute,this much feet&#x27;s the whole generation and is happening with no
springs attached.they say it is a fare movie but i am not buying.and if
you think that there is sock in my crock,you are right,for i can&#x27;t no
more of this Sh#t ...
