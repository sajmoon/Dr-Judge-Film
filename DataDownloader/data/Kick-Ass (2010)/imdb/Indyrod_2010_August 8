I have mixed feelings on this comic book based film, about a wannabe
super-hero kid, that doesn&#x27;t have any super powers. First time through
I didn&#x27;t like it at all, and then a second viewing with commentary made
it a little better. The best part of the film is eleven year old Chloe
Moretz, who plays a real super-hero, Hit-Girl, and also Mark Strong as
the bad guy. Nicholas Cage as Hit-Girl&#x27;s super-hero Father, that might
be a little over the hill, is a small role but pretty effective,
especially when we first meet them with the pistol shooting scene. All
in all, it&#x27;s a very silly film, but definitely not a children&#x27;s movie,
as the violence is pretty graphic and bloody. I can&#x27;t recommend it, but
it does have a couple of good set pieces.
