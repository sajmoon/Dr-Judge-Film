he most interesting aspect of this film, is the fact that it&#x27;s
essentially the origin of a superhero before he&#x27;s a superhero. The
explanation behind this is simple. Dave Lizewski ponders why someone
hasn&#x27;t tried to become a hero in the real world. Unlike other
traditional heroes in the medium, Dave acts upon his instincts before
any real transformation occurs and the result sends him the the
emergency room. This is where&#x27;s Dave story now takes a twist of fate
and this is essentially where the film takes a nose dive. This is not
to suggest the film is bad, but it just seems to fall flat by the
second and third act. Consider the idea that the film is crucially
setting us up for a satirical look of the superhero medium, but try as
it might can&#x27;t seem to get passed the birdbrained notion its a
superhero movie. It stalls and putters along the way and by the climax,
it&#x27;s now entered the same territory it was initially critiquing in the
first place. Nice moments here involving Nic Cage and an Adam West
impression, but the film at the end of it all just isn&#x27;t interesting
enough on the questions it asks and ultimately falls flat on it&#x27;s face.
