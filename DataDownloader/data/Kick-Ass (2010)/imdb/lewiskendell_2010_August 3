&#x22;Come on, be honest with yourself. At some point in our lives, we all
wanted to be a superhero.&#x22;&#xA0;<br /><br />I&#x27;m loving the recent bounty of &#x22;real people as superheroes&#x22; movies.
Whether they&#x27;re adaptations of graphic novels like Kick-Ass and
Watchmen, or original stories like Defendor and the upcoming movie
Super, I can&#x27;t get enough of them.<br /><br />Kick-Ass (the graphic novel) is like Watchmen for the new generation.
Not as momentous or genre-defining of course, but still just as
post-modern, in its own way. The movie adaptation does feature some
changing and refocusing of the original story, but I think it holds up
pretty well.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is entertaining, which is the most important thing. Funny
often, violent often, often funny AND violent, and (very) occasionally
poignant. Nicholas Cage is better suited for this kind of irreverent
movie than almost anything more serious, Aaron Johnson is a decent
Dave, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as funny as usual, and Chloe Moretz
steals the show, as she often does. The more the movie focuses on her,
the better it is. &#xA0;&#xA0;<br /><br />A lot of fuss had been made about the violence in this movie, and of
course, Hit Girl. Well, those people would be shocked to know that the
story and Hit Girl herself have greatly been toned down from what you&#x27;d
see if you read the graphic novel. Several of the more &#x22;questionable&#x22;
things were cut out of the movie entirely, and the ending is decidedly
more general audience friendly than it originally was.&#xA0;<br /><br />Kick-Ass (while violent, don&#x27;t get me wrong) is no more violent than
something like Watchmen, and beyond the shock factor some people may
feel about seeing a 12 year- old use some very improper language,
there&#x27;s nothing here more offensive than what you&#x27;d see in a similarly
rated action movie. All of Hit Girl&#x27;s scenes (really, the entire movie)
are so over the top and unrealistic, that I honestly don&#x27;t see how
anyone could be bothered by that character. If she&#x27;s an issue for you,
this really isn&#x27;t the kind of movie you should be watching. I just
thought I&#x27;d address that, because I quite frankly thought that the
controversy over all that was ridiculous.<br /><br />You should easily be able to tell from the trailer if you&#x27;ll this
movie. If you thought those were awesome, you&#x27;ll enjoy this. If you
thought otherwise, don&#x27;t bother. It&#x27;s not for you. Fans of the graphic
novel should also be reasonably pleased, as the casting was solid, a
lot of the story was kept intact, and it&#x27;s just plain fun to watch.
