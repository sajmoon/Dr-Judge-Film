This film took me by surprise. It was strange and unexpected. I didn&#x27;t
know what to make of it yet I enjoyed it a lot. The trailers weren&#x27;t
impressive. It looked like a movie about ordinary people trying to be
superheroes. I&#x27;ve seen other movies like that but it was obvious this
film wasn&#x27;t meant to be realistic, with the over-the-top violence and
the supposedly ordinary people performing impossible tricks. At first
this put me off but as I continued to watch, the more I liked this
film. It had likable characters, a great fairytale story, exciting
action befitting of a film whose title is Kick-Ass and a surprisingly
good soundtrack. There was a lot of Spider-Man and Superbad in this
film and a touch of the black comedy of Heathers. It&#x27;s an odd mix, yet
it all just worked.
