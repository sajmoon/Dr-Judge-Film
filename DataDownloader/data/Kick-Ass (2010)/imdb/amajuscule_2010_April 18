This movie is terrible with a capital T. As if the directors of &#x22;Home
Alone 2&#x22; decided to make a preteen adaptation of &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22;. The
gore is hideous and stupid, the jokes and dialogue just plain boring.
The soundtrack is terrible and the underlying idea that it is somehow
funny to watch a ten year old girl execute people is just plain sick.<br /><br />It&#x27;s got no class, no style and its not even terribly original.
Disturbing, Dull and Dumb all rolled into one. Don&#x27;t waste your time.<br /><br />This movie is terrible with a capital T. As if the directors of &#x22;Home
