To tell you honestly, I first checked out its rating here before
watching it. I said to my self. &#x22;Why the heck does just about every
hyped new movie is included in the top 250?&#x22; But after watching it, it
deserved to be in that list. If Spiderman, Sin City, Reservoir Dogs,
Kill Bill are in the top 250, I see no reason why Kickass would not be.
The movie was well made, the action sequence was well directed combined
with the background music during fight scenes. And the most amazing
part of the movie is the scene where Hitgirl &#x22;sobbed&#x22; subtly, the way
she put out the fire, the way she said &#x22;Good night&#x22;. It appears that
even in her most traumatic and saddest moment, she was still as tough
as what Big Daddy taught her to be. Should be nominated for best
dramatic scene or best violent scene whichever you prefer.<br /><br />Sometimes old-timers like to hold on to their best movies of all times,
they call every good new movie overrated. when in fact at times history
is happening in front of their eyes. This will go down to be the
Reservoir Dogs of 21st century, just more entertaining.
