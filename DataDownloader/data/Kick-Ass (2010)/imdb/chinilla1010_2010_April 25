Well, I had high expectations for Kick-Ass, primarily because another
website said that it was a &#x22;Great fight movie&#x22; and the sole review on
IMDb insisted that it was &#x22;engaging&#x22; and &#x22;the fight scenes are
excellent&#x22;, among other things.<br /><br />All I can say is that Kick-Ass lives up to NONE of these glowing
comments. In fact, it&#x27;s quite bad. Let&#x27;s put it this way. I&#x27;ve seen 130
action films from China, Japan, Thailand, and Korea. Kick-Ass is
probably in the bottom 10-15 percentile, which means that of the total
130 action films I&#x27;ve seen, this movie is worse than 110 of them.<br /><br />First of all, the fighting scenes are horribly choreographed. Take 10
dudes, throw them together in a brawl, then have them execute some
basic punches and kicks. Congratulations - you now have an &#x22;action
sequence&#x22; for Kick-Ass. Needless to say, it&#x27;s not even the slightest
bit entertaining.<br /><br />Anyone who is deluded enough to claim that the fight scenes in this
film are &#x22;excellent&#x22; should seriously consider watching some of the
other fare from East Asia, preferably So Close, Azumi, Tom Yum Goong,
Ong Bak, Fist of Legend, Hard Boiled, Tai Chi Master, or The Legend of
Drunken Master, to name only a few. If one wishes to see fight scenes
that are driven by an intense storyline and character development, one
should refer to Kill Zone, Oldboy, Shiri, or A Bittersweet Life, to
name only a few. The fight scenes in Kick-Ass are neither
choreographically precise nor emotional. They are simply boring and
formulaic.<br /><br />Even more abhorrent is that the final fight is never allowed the
finish! The filmmakers cut away just as the lead protagonist and
antagonist start getting it on. This is just horrible film-making,
plain and simple.<br /><br />The pacing of the film also suffers. There are a few fights at the
beginning and one at the end. The middle 70 minutes are sleep-inducing
nothingness. I like slow films with character development (see the
latter references above), but for goodness sakes - give me something
interesting! Kick-Ass offers absolutely nothing except a few funny
moments. Not good.<br /><br />The hype surrounding this film reminds me of Geochilmaru, another
obscenely overrated action film that is light on choreography as well
as drama. However, Geochilmaru is still better than this turd.<br /><br />If you really want to see a good action film, watch A Bittersweet Life,
Shiri, Taegukgi, or No Blood No Tears. Kick-Ass is a waste of time that
lures you in with inaccurate, hype-driven online reviews.
