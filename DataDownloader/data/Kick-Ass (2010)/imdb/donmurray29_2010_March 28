I read the graphic novel and wondered how this would flesh out on the
big screen, and it works very well, a lot more funnier than than the
comic, which I didn&#x27;t expect, plus the dark humour works well, for a
super hero action film in this, which is rare, only Hancock managed too
pull this off.<br /><br />At least it&#x27;s not as bloody and violent as the comic itself, which is
worth a read, get the hardback version. One of the films of the year as
it&#x27;s so crazy but it works. The costumes are accurate, simple and not
really unbelievable, and plenty of guns, and weapons the like that
Batman would never use.<br /><br />What makes this are the performances, Nicholas Cage is brilliant, his
dry wit makes his character memorable, Mark Strong is topper too. <br /><br />We have Iron Man 2 and Prince of Persia, game to movie adaptations up
next.
