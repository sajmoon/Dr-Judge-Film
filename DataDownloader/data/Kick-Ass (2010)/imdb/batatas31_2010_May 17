I&#x27;m really starting to loose faith in the American audience. While the
premise of this film is very promising, this movie is absolute garbage.
Kick Ass fails because the movie doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to to be.
Is it supposed to be a comedy with action, or an action movie with
comedy? The answer to that question, however, is that it is neither.
The movie fails because it tries to be both and ends up ruining the
basic elements of either genre. The parts that were supposed to be cool
were mixed in with comedy that completely resets the tone. I&#x27;m not
saying that action movies cannot have funny parts, but the way in which
this movie does it is all wrong. I can say so many bad things about
this movie, but then I would end up writing a book. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll leave it at this. Kick Ass is not only overrated, but it is also
complete garbage. While watching this movie, I never found myself
laughing because it felt almost out of place to laugh. If this film was
meant to be a comedy, then I say that it took itself way too seriously.
And if this movies was supposed to be an action movie, then it ruined
all the cool stuff by adding humor at the worst possible moments. It
makes me mad that people actually like this film. I believe in giving
credit where credit is due, but this movie definitely does not deserve
the critical acclaim that it&#x27;s getting.
