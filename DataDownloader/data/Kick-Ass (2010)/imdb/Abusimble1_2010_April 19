I cannot begin to convey the depth of chagrin one feels when reading
the reviews about this movie. The film is being hailed as a masterpiece
and the next great painting that hangs in The Louvre. America is a sick
nation. Mentally. Spiritually. Culturally. And it&#x27;s getting more ill as
time goes by. The deterioration has been rapid. Due to the now rapid
dissemination of information, the problem is that the rest of the world
will follow.<br /><br />I exhort, nay, I beseech all normal people and especially parents
around the world to resist this malady that is seemingly omnipotent and
omnipresent. I make this plea to you because the internet now allows
export of this malady to all corners of the globe effortlessly. The
malady is in the form of acculturation to deaden our senses to
violence, feminism, devaluation of parents and debauchery, and this
malady is what currently governs American thinking.<br /><br />Resist in your minds the temptation to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.
Resist in your hearts the impulse of accepting these deleterious, inane
movies, as real films, simply because they are being touted as being
made by the United States.<br /><br />This film is one thing only: Evil incarnate. I say it again,
unequivocally and without hesitation. This movie is evil. And I urge
all governments to ban it forthwith! &#x22;There is nothing truly good or
bad, only that we make it so.&#x22; - A liar made this statement long ago
when the world was still able to distinguish right and wrong. Perhaps
that is why he never gave his name to this quote.
