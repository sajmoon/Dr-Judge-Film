Really interesting combination of high school comedy, extreme violence
and parody. One could expect this to just feel awkward but it doesn&#x27;t.
Everything in Kick-ass works just perfect, the music, action,
characters, humor just everything. It turns out to be one of the most
original superhero film in I don&#x27;t know how long. It&#x27;s simply
brilliant.<br /><br />So the film is really violent perhaps on of the bloodiest superhero
films ever. But it&#x27;s not to much, really well thought out, cool looking
without being overdone and taking a to big part of the film. The action
scenes feel pretty realistic, well some things the characters do are a
bit over the top but surprisingly little. It actually manages to create
a bit of suspense. The humor is great, some jokes are funny just on
there own and others are part parody of other recent superhero films.
But even if you haven&#x27;t seen them you will find the film greatly
entertaining. The acting is really good. I&#x27;m not usually a fan of
Nicolas Cage but here he was great. Some things the characters say and
do feel somewhat weird at times but I guess that meant to be so.
Eventough it&#x27;s superheroes the parts of the characters ordinary life is
just as funny. The characters are so well done and the parts of there
non superhero life makes them possible to relate to, very impressive.
However the film is not so long, not even two hours. I felt it could be
a bit longer, sure some films that are good can start to drag anyway
but when the credits started to roll I was just what it finished
already.<br /><br />This is one of the best films of 2010. I don&#x27;t read much comics anymore
and I didn&#x27;t know anything about it so Kick-ass was one of the years
positive surprises. Maybe the most original superhero film in years and
also one of the best 8/10. I really hope for a sequel, it would work.
Kick-ass is amazing!
