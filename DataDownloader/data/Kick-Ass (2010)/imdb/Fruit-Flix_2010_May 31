This is a movie that flips the comic book genre on its head. It&#x27;s very
refreshing to see something completely different in this genre after 50
Batmans, four X-mens, 3 Spidermans, 2 Hulks, and 2 Iron Mans. Kick Ass
has a great story, plenty of excitement &#x26; action, and some killer
comedy. I can totally see why some people would be offended by some of
the content of this movie, but its all contextual and easy to shrug off
with a point of view that it&#x27;s all just a bit of fun.<br /><br />On the Fruit-Meter Kick Ass gets the &#x27;Pineapple&#x27; - A big and bold
movie. Plenty of zesty flavours, and has a spiky outer skin that may
hurt viewers with delicate skin.
