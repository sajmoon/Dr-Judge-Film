I think that the comic media possesses some magic property which
facilitates the assimilation of fantasy combined with some degrees of
&#x22;reality&#x22;.The secret may be in the way in which the brain processes the
draws, or it may lies on the intermediate space between panels, where
our mind adds the necessary information in order to complement the
narrative and bring it fluidity and coherence.Because of that it is
such a difficult work to adapt a superheroes story to the big
screen...what wonderfully works in the pages of a comic can feel absurd
and out of place when it becomes into real people fighting in real
locations.Some movies (for example, Batman Begins or Spider Man 1 and
2) preserved the alchemical combination, while other ones fatally fail
because of the incompatibility between concept and execution (for
example, Catwoman or The Punisher).So, what can we expect of a movie
based on a &#x22;realistic&#x22; comic which examines the existence of heroes in
contemporary society? Co-screenwriters Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman
(Vaughn was also the director) made their best effort to find that
precarious balance in Kick-Ass, and even though they did not always
achieve it, the ingenious story and the interesting characters help to
endure the least unfortunate moments from the movie.<br /><br />I think that I went to see Kick Ass with excessively high
expectations.I liked it, but at the same time, I felt the narrative to
be a bit weak.Despite the dynamism Vaughn brought to the intense action
sequences, the film has a low level of energy, something which is
translated on a reduced emotional impact despite the good moments of
suspense, twists, revelation, triumph and failure the movie has.I
honestly do not know how to exactly describe my reaction; I simply feel
that the film should have gone further on every sense.If it had engaged
with a more concrete style (like the expressionist dystopia from Batman
Returns or the melodramatic rawness from Watchmen), Kick-Ass would have
generated a defined identity instead of rambling between genres and
repeatedly encountering with the diffuse line between reality and
fantasy.<br /><br />But, despite all that, I enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the
characters and the performances which bring them to life.Aaron Johnson
is natural and enthusiastic as the main character.As the ambiguous Red
Mist, Christopher Mintz-Plasse exercises another facet of his talent by
bringing a darker &#x22;taste&#x22; to the kind of acting he made in Superbad and
Role Models.Mark Strong is perfect as the villain, because he is always
very credible and he avoids his character to become into a
caricature.However, it is impossible to deny that Nicolas Cage and
Chloe Moretz steal the show.The young Moretz is definitely a
revelation, and her performance in Kick Ass incremented my curiosity
for the remake of the excellent Let the Right One In.As for Cage, his
character could have degenerated into a bunch of exaggeration, but he
modulated it to the perfection.And finally, I also liked the
performances from Clark Duke, Evan Peters and Lyndsy Fonseca; their
characters may seem as &#x22;fillers&#x22;, but they habit them with credibility
and enthusiasm.<br /><br />The screenplay from Kick-Ass moves a bit away from the original comic,
something which usually would not bother me very much; but in this
case, I felt that the introduction of caricature elements (specially
near the ending) betrays the ideals from creators Mark Millar and John
Romita Jr.In other words, I would have preferred the movie to respect
the brutal contrasts from the graphic novel a bit more (yes, despite
the bloody violence, I felt the movie flinched on various
scenes).However, all my complaints do not avoid me from recommending
Kick-Ass as an entertaining re-interpretation of the modern superhero,
which will not change the face of the genre, but which made me have a
good time.
