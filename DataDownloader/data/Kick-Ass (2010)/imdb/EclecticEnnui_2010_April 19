2010_April 19 
You know, a funny little thing happened on the way to see this film at
the theatre. My friend drove me and he&#x27;s a rough driver. For the whole
trip, the car would go fast, then slow, stop quickly, and make sharp
curves; all while loud music (mostly rock and rap) was playing.
Relaxing in the car was impossible. Why am I telling you this? Because
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is one of those flicks that also dares you to relax. In
fact, it might as well put a gun to your head and dare you. I sure as
hell don&#x27;t mean this in a bad way, though, because &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; delivers
with its humour, fast-paced action, and general awesomeness. It doesn&#x27;t
work the entire time, but I got what I wanted: pure escapism.<br /><br />I wish I could end the review right there, because this doesn&#x27;t seem
like the kind of film you should analyze and, instead, just enjoy with
your buddies. Nonetheless, all films are fair game for reviewing. There
are always reasons for liking or disliking a film. (Captain Obvious
could tell you that.) So, let&#x27;s dig deeper.<br /><br />We meet Dave Lizewski, a geeky high school student who decides to
become a vigilante superhero, like in the comics. Well, not quite, as
he doesn&#x27;t have any superpowers or training. Still, he buys a green
suit online and gives it a go. After trying to fight two car jacking
thugs, one stabs him and he subsequently gets hit by a car in an
amusing manner because of how unlucky he is. However, his luck changes
for the better as he gets out of the hospital with nerve damage giving
him the ability to not feel pain and his bones have been repaired with
metal plates. Therefore, he tries again. One night, he walks around in
public wearing his suit (lol) and finds some more thugs beating
someone. This time, Dave successfully fights them off and since the
fight is videotaped, his alter ego Kick-Ass becomes an overnight
sensation and, well, the story has just begun.<br /><br />There are so many funny lines and moments that it would be ridiculous
to name them all. The humour skews towards the kind you&#x27;d find in a
Tarantino film; black. Right at the beginning of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, a
superhero wannabe jumps off of a tall building attempting to fly and,
instead, plummets to his death. That immediately tells you this isn&#x27;t
gonna be a feel-good comedy. I have to admit I laughed at that, too.
The most memorable scenes probably come from Mindy/Hit-Girl and her
father Damon/Big Daddy. They&#x27;re the utmost unusual parent-child pairing
I think I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie. Damon, played excellently by Nicolas
Cage, trains Mindy to be a killing machine. This makes Mindy, herself,
to be really bizarre for a child. In one scene, she cuts up a bunch of
bad guys in a room, which is amazingly hyperreal and funny. It might
even slightly remind you of the infamous restaurant fight scene in
&#x22;Kill Bill: Vol. 1&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is stylish, but also has substance. I found Dave and his
friends to be relatable, since I actually have friends like them,
including the guy who drove me. Mindy and Damon are given a backstory
that&#x27;s shown through a superbly animated comic. In spite of the film&#x27;s
unique quality, another film came out recently called &#x22;Defendor&#x22;, also
about a superhero wannabe, starring Woody Harrelson. I personally like
that film more because it&#x27;s abundant with humanity and I didn&#x27;t feel
overwhelmed during the last quarter as I unfortunately did with
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;. The grand conclusion and the scenes prior to it didn&#x27;t
amuse or thrill me quite like the rest of the film. They&#x27;re even sort
of predictable. The good news is those are the only real complaints I
have.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is based on a series of comics, which I haven&#x27;t read.
Regardless, the film feels like it was written and directed by movie
lovers. Props go to all the actors for helping to make it come alive.
I&#x27;m going to close with a clich&#xE9;d pun, but I don&#x27;t give a f**k:
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; kicks ass.
