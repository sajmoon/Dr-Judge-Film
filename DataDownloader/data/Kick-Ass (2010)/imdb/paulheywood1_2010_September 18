After many let downs over the last few years I was wondering where the
next great movie was coming from. Kick Ass resolved that.<br /><br />Funny and great plot line and a perfectly scored soundtrack (I&#x27;ve been
driving into work to the Prodigys &#x22;Stand up&#x22; all week!!) Sad I know!!
One of those movies that is great the first time you watch add gets
better each time you watch it.<br /><br />I have seen so many movies lately when my expectations were so high
only to be let down. This movie has great characters/plot in a Coeh
Brothers style, with Tarrantino violence,Stan Lee comic book effects
and music straight from Glastonbry and to me thats a great cocktail.<br /><br />I would never normally give a movie a ten out of ten (even Apocalypse
Now wouldn&#x27;t get that) however I felt I had to got the IMDb average up,
this would still easily score 9.5 out of ten.<br /><br />In summary if you like good fun movies that when you finish watching it
you feel better than you did beforehand buy/watch this movie.<br /><br />Now where my is superhero outfit? There must be crime to fight!!
