I was expecting another some kind of a superhero parody, but no this
was different ,this movie had it all, it shocked me, it&#x27;s way better
than I expected.<br /><br />The movie appears to be a parody but is not , it has much more than
that, there are elements from movies like 300, Kill Bill, elements from
movies like Spider-Man ,Batman , elements from movies like The
Punisher, Street Kings, elements from movies like The Godfather,
Goodfellas, elements from movies like Superhero Movie which I think is
very underrated, this is a movie with five elements.<br /><br />Director Matthew Vaughn made a great job assembling these elements and
it turn out a superb movie.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy.
