my first:<br /><br />It is easy to mistake this movie for a blockbuster eat popcorn thing
when you see the trailer. But it isn&#x27;t. It is full of good ideas. It
drinks a bit of inspiration in loads of movies and makes one of the
best movies i have ever seen. The beauty is in the details. It even has
a moral underneath... And thats odd when there&#x27;s blood everywhere. Even
Big Daddy has a lot of depth as a character... And it is still very
very funny and light.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not a spoiler so...<br /><br />Just give it a go. It will be a cult movie<br /><br />Ps: this movie was the reason of my first micro-movie review. i think
thats a good clue that this is a quality movie
