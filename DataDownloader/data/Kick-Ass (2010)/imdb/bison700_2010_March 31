Watching the trailer you may think &#x22;yeah this could be a pretty funny
comedy about super heroes but maybe all the funny bits were shown in
the trailer&#x22;. WRONG!<br /><br />This is a very funny film but it is not a comedy, in fact it is very
hard to put your finger on a genre that this lies in. I would probably
call it a comic book, comedy, action movie but there&#x27;s one thing for
sure, that this movie will excite you beyond belief. It is one of the
most pure adrenaline fuelled movies i have ever seen. So much so that
there was multiple time where i just wanted to jump out of my seat and
cheer in the middle of the cinema. This is not just because of the
brilliant action sequences but mainly due to the fact that you have
become completely attached to the characters and you are so happy that
even though they have been through a lot they are totally &#x22;KICKING
ASS&#x22;.<br /><br />It is the character development that does this film the most justice,
this is due to great script writing and equally great acting. You feel
like you know the characters so in that respect the film can really
play with your emotions by making you want to either cry or cheer when
something substantial happens to one of the characters. All of which
are great, one surprise was the character of hit girl who provided most
of the laughs and winces thanks to her outrageous behaviour, her
violent action sequences and her brilliant characterisation.<br /><br />The bottom line is you will enjoy this film. I can imagine when this
comes out on DVD it will be one of my most watched films and it makes
you wonder, why has no one tried to be a superhero before?
