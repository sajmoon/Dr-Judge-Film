I was in for a complete surprise with this movie. I expected a teenage
high school comedy. The only reason I watched it was because of its
surprisingly high rating on IMDb. <br /><br />The movie starts slow but hooks you in and never lets you go. The wit,
humor and clever dialog are definitely there, but when the action and
insanity kick in, then you are in a for a thrill ride all the way to
the grand finale. <br /><br />Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) steals the show. Can&#x27;t wait to see more of her.
This movie has touches of Tarantino&#x27;s Pulp Fiction/Kill Bill and
Natalie Portman&#x27;s Leon (The Professional).<br /><br />Surprisingly good and entertaining. Would watch it again.
