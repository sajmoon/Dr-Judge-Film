I LOVED and i mean LOVED kick-ass! it has become my favorite &#x22;supe
hero&#x22; movie EVER! ironically the super hero in this film is far from
super, but that&#x27;s what makes this movie so special and amazing! my
favorite character would have to be HIT GIRL/Mindy, she was incredible
in her role, she portrayed it so skillfully and perfectly. the
character of Hit Girl was so complex, she was the obedient daughter who
has a great relationship with her father and she was also a cold
blooded killer machine. the perfect combination. now i&#x27;m not gonna
forget about kick-ass himself, his bravery and how naive he was surely
made this movie even more amazing, i don&#x27;t think anyone would&#x27;ve pulled
the kick-ass role better than Aaron Johnson who&#x27;s proved he&#x27;s more than
just a &#x22;sex god&#x22;. the plot was complex and VERY unpredictable which is
rare in the &#x22;nowadays&#x22; movies. so i&#x27;m gonna give this movie a 10/10
because it most definitely earned it
