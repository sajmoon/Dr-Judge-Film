2011_July 13 
I can&#x27;t think of a better summary for this film, but this is not only
one of the more enjoyable superhero films recently, but also of the
overall year of 2010. I had heard it was good, but I wasn&#x27;t sure
whether it would be my thing. I needn&#x27;t have worried.<br /><br />Kick-Ass was hugely enjoyable from start to finish. The production
values from the photography and editing to the glorious costumes are
striking, and the soundtrack has a lot of energy. As does the fast
pace, the smart and witty dialogue and a fun and unpredictable story.
The characters are also at least engaging, the action is fantastically
choreographed and edited and the acting even from Nicholas Cage(who I
have found resume-wise inconsistent) is much better than one would
hope.<br /><br />Overall, truly wonderful and totally kicks ass. 10/10 Bethany Cox
