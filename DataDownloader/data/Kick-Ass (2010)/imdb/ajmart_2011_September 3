When it comes to Nicholas Cage, his recent movies have not usually been
big hits. The movies ThevSoreceror&#x27;s Apprentice and Season of the Witch
were both awful. Recently, I watched the movie Drive Angry with him in
it, and it wasn&#x27;t very good either. But one movie that I can say
without a doubt is my favorite of his is this one.<br /><br />The bulk of this movie follows Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), who is
geeky, comic-loving seventeen year old. He wonders why no one has ever
attempted to become a superhero in real life, so he decides to become
the superhero Kick-Ass. At first, things do not go very well, but he
eventually becomes an Internet celebrity and gets in way over his head.
During all of this, he tries to impress Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca),
a pretty girl in his class.<br /><br />A sub-plot, however follows a young girl, known as Hit Girl (Chole
Grace Moretz), and her father, known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage). They
are after the crime lord of the city, Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong),
because he framed Big Daddy as a drug dealer, and it lead to the death
of his wife.<br /><br />In a final sub-plot, Chris D&#x27;Amico (Chistopher Mintz-Plasse), the son
of Frank, wants to become a mob boss like his father, but his father
neglects his hopes to follow him.<br /><br />Everytihg about this movie is done very well. The characters are well
developed, and you feel bad for them in some sense, and the actors who
portrayed them did awesome. The action scenes are fun and graphic, with
great choreography and special effects. The music is epic, helping to
keep the mood throughout. The story, as explained above, does get more
complex, but is never hard to follow, and is very realistic.<br /><br />I will say, I find it very refreshing to see a superhero movie that is
so brutally realistic. You should definitely see this movie, if you
love superhero, action, or comedies.
