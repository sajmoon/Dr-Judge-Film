Let us see just how far we push it as a society! Yes, violence is a
part of life. I am a realist and can enjoy a violent movie as much a
anyone, but putting little kids in it and making them the killers, for
any cause? Would this movie suffer at all if rather than featuring a
little kid it had a young adult? What was the purpose? What is next, I
venture to guess? First, they take &#x22;Cars&#x22; and turn a cute little movie
for kids into a sequel where characters get blown up and tortured, aka
James Bond (and get to keep the G rating!!!!) Now, trying to set a new
milestone, comes &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; which features a pre-teen little girl
happily shooting, slicing and dicing other people, with utter
enjoyment.<br /><br />Up next, I am sure, a Disney movie featuring two year old toddlers
armed with bazookas and gatling guns defending the neighborhood
playground from local gangs, featuring plenty of blood and gore, with
little bodies strewn all over.<br /><br />If you really enjoyed &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; without any reservations, take a
good... deep.... look INSIDE yourself, and then ask yourself a few
questions. It is not about how well it is made as a movie. It is about
something utterly, fundamentally wrong with the entire premise for this
movie, and the fact that most people accept it with little more than a
shrug.
