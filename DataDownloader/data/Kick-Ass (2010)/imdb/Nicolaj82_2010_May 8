The short version. I really enjoyed this movie, it was much better than
expected, and just watching that little girl slay one bad guy after the
other is just soo satisfying, every dads dream girl.<br /><br />I&#x27;m glad i watched this, from viewing the trailers i thought it had a
teen comedy kinda stench over it, and i hate those, but damn i was
wrong.<br /><br />The action scenes are really well made, the choreography is superb in
my opinion, the comedy is funny and the story is good, it&#x27;s absolutely
one of the better superhero movies i&#x27;ve seen and i would recommend to
every one, it&#x27;s a thrill ride and you don&#x27;t want it to stop.
