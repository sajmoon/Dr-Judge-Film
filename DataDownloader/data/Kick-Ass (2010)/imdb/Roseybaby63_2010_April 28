When I went to see this movie I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. It
seemed like it could have been either fun or just a corny satire of
some sort. Well....this movie had it all...for me anyway. I was sucked
in right from the beginning. I like the idea of regular people wanting
to do good and try to be heroic.<br /><br />I was interested in the characters right away and wanted to see what
would happen. Even after getting stabbed and run over by a car,
Kick-ass just can&#x27;t stop wanting to help. When he meets the resident
masked heroes, he feels kind of inept. I love Nicholas Cage as Big
Daddy. When he&#x27;s in costume and speaks, he so reminds me of Adam West&#x27;s
delivery in the old Batman show. He&#x27;s just quirky enough to do his part
justice. My favorite of them all is Hit Girl. She&#x27;s the most
fascinating character. Her fight scenes are brilliant. Besides all
this, there&#x27;s some bad guys doing bad things that need to be stopped.
There&#x27;s also a personal vendetta against the big boss by Big Daddy and
Hit Girl. I won&#x27;t spoil anything, but the last fight is a work of
beauty.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a fan of comic books, but someone who isn&#x27;t can enjoy this movie
just as much. The story is good and makes enough sense..the action is
exciting and the characters are interesting. I absolutely recommend
this movie for viewing. Personally, I&#x27;d like to see a movie about Hit
Girl. Maybe how she became the unstoppable, killing machine that she
is. It would be a nice to see Big Daddy raising her. Anyway...go see
this movie. It&#x27;s well worth it.
