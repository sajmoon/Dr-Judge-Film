2010_April 10 
KICK-ASS! I finally saw Kick-Ass on April 8th with a crowd ready for a
great time, and YouTube reporter/movie reviewer/practical joker Eric
Striffler. I even met the dude and he saw it three times (SXSW, College
screening, and the screening I attended).<br /><br />Now let&#x27;s talk about the film, Kick-Ass:<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lezewski who has wondered, &#x22;How come
nobody&#x27;s ever tried to be a superhero?&#x22; When he attempts this, he gets
his ass kicked. Then, he is sent to a hospital where he was able to get
metal plates in his head. He goes and tries to be a superhero once more
and kicks the asses of a few muggers. As a result, he becomes a
YouTube/Myspace phenomenon. This gets many into the superhero business
including Red Mist, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl.<br /><br />Let me say right off the bat that this is by FAR the best film of 2010
so far! This is the first perfect film of the year. It has a perfect
cast ranging from Nicholas Cage giving a sort of Adam West/Batman feel
to his Big Daddy character, to a vulgar, violent, and hilarious
performance by Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. Even the small roles like
Frank D&#x27;Micco&#x27;s bodyguards, to Katie are great. Not a single bad
performance in this movie.<br /><br />The humor is spot on, although not the best humor I&#x27;ve heard this year.
Most of the humor does come from Clark Duke and Evan Peters who do
bring some great laughs here. I would say that this is the best film in
the comedy genre, but I&#x27;d still say that Hot Tub Time Machine is the
funniest film this year.<br /><br />Now let&#x27;s talk about the violence which is why people want to see the
movie. The violence/gore was beautiful! It was just amazing watching
these people die in very creative ways. This film is filled with blood
flying everywhere. People are being shot in the face, people explode,
and people get their throats slit as if Sweeny Todd was doing it.<br /><br />I adore this film on a level that people feel with The Dark Knight.
This film is the best superhero film I have seen and the best film of
all- time other than Avatar.<br /><br />Overall, I give Kick-Ass a 5 out of 5 (*****)
