Dave Levinsky is one of those lame teenagers who spend 99% of their
times jerking off, and the rest of time reading comic books. He soon
starts fantasizing about becoming a superhero vigilante under the
pseudonym &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;. Unfortunately his high expectations are not
supported by superpowers or extraordinary capabilities.<br /><br />After an appearance on TV, David &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is contacted by 2
hyper-violent vigilantes, which are of much higher level, and are doing
real harm to the local drug mafia. Indeed, those 2 characters do not
hesitate to use the most deadly weapons, or to even sell drugs, to
fight the crime their own way...<br /><br />This movie is very disappointing. It is marketed as a teenage movie,
with a blend of American Pie, Superbad and Spiderman. Sadly, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
ends up being not so funny, and becomes a tribute to heavy gun violence
and self-justice and broken ethics. For example, the 2 superheros
resell drugs to fund their armory, which is not what you would expect
from &#x22;good&#x22; guys. Did I mention, those 2 superheroes are father and
daughter, the later (11-year old girl) skipping school to practice guns
and kung-fu?<br /><br />The film production is also deeply disappointing, the screenplay is
minimal, the special effects being very visible and exaggerated. The
acting is very poor, you can hear laughs in the auditory when Nicolas
Cage is narrating the death of his beloved pregnant wife. The &#x22;bad&#x22;
guys have absolutely no presence.<br /><br />Finally like many recent blockbuster movies, the director makes sure to
keep one the bad guy alive, in order to leave the door opened for a
very profitable sequel (Kick-Ass 2 is already scheduled for 2012).<br /><br />To be avoided. 3/10
