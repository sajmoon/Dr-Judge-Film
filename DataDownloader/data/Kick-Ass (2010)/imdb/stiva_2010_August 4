Can I simply just say wow!. <br /><br />Now this is what I call a real superhero comedy movie. The story is
simple to its core. It&#x27;s about a geek who fantasies on becoming a
superhero.<br /><br />The character, Dave, a fan of super-hero comic books one days wonders
whether anyone would take a stance and fight against crime. And, thus
comes Kick-Ass into the picture. The complexity of the character
written for Dave is performed excellently by Aaron Johnson. Who doesn&#x27;t
dream of becoming a super-hero in reality. Dream of being special and
do something incredible. The character Dave here is a superhero not
because he has super powers, but because he brings the inspiration for
turning into a superhero. He successfully shows his strength in
fighting crime as a normal human.<br /><br />The next best thing is the comedy and the timing. A complete blast.
This movie will just blow you away. It&#x27;s not good. It&#x27;s not great. It&#x27;s
totally awesome. Character Dave dressed up as Kick-Ass and leaves home
to fight crime only to find him looking for a lost cat. And the music
is the next best part. In the where they play &#x22;For A Few Dollars More&#x22;
I just had this feeling like wow. I mean, for that part the music
seemed fitting as such the other musical pieces in different parts of
the movie. Yes, they seemed to fit well with the movie. <br /><br />Next, Nicholas Cage as the Big Daddy has his share of the movie. His
appearance in this movie will be recognized well. This super-hero, he
wants to wipe out the entire the criminal organization which took away
his loving wife, shows the anger for his need to wipe out the crime as
a human. Wouldn&#x27;t you want to revenge on the person if he/she took the
love of your life ? Nicholas Cage succeeds in showing both the human
side as well as the superhero side struggling with the pain. The
performance in this movie is class A.<br /><br />Next thing, my personal favorite, the amazing awesome Chloe Moretz as
the Hit Girl. She completely steals away the entire movie. Every scene
she&#x27;s in is a complete delight to watch. Especially the last 25 minutes
of the movie where the action sequences are spell-binding. <br /><br />I have seen lot of bad reviews. I don&#x27;t care about them as it is
impossible to satisfy the entire population of the world. I enjoyed
this movie for what it was. A very bold attempt and it served it&#x27;s
purpose excellently well. Extremely funny and little sad filled with
some mind blowing adrenaline filled action sequences. <br /><br />In short, this movie just kicks ass...
