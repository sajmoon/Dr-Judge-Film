OK this movie was a LITTLE bit different.<br /><br />Kick Ass plays with the expectations of the viewer. It has the look and
feel of &#x22;Spy Kids&#x22;, but strikes you as the &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; with
pure brutality from time to time. Sounds entertaining? Could have
been... Most of the playtime u have to sit through the more or less
boring teen life of Dave Lizewski a.k. KickA**. He is a great contrast
to Hit Girl for sure by being such a normal high school looser teen,
but it is overdone. I think the major flaw oft his movie is, that the
story is just a custom unimaginative Hollywood commodity. Evil Man gets
what he deserves by whatever... So why did I rate this sh** 6 Points?
It is still fun and it has a unique look and feel, but most importantly
Chloe Moretz performance was amazing. I am really looking forward to
see more Movies with her. I cant think of any other child actor making
this movie work. And it worked - it&#x27;s no Masterpiece but I liked it<br /><br />(Sorry for my bad English, or not?)
