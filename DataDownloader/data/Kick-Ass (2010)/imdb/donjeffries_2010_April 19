It was really only a matter of time. The culmination of decades of
brainwashing, dumbing down and awful, awful artistry have resulted in
&#x22;Kick Ass.&#x22; Yes, it was also only a matter of time until someone
produced a movie with that title. Now that another cultural barrier has
crashed, look forward to movies with cherished words like &#x22;Retard&#x22; and
&#x22;Balls&#x22; in their titles. Use your imagination- it&#x27;s easy to envision
really profound titles by sprinkling in all those formerly forbidden
words.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, Hollywood takes its most prevalent theme- that
of females beating up males- and speeds it up to a wharp factor. First,
the female doing all that ass kicking is 11. ELEVEN. And she isn&#x27;t
content to knock them out with one punch from her dainty fists. No, she
gruesomely kills them. While enjoying it immensely. She also enjoys
mutilating them in the process. <br /><br />The fact that any audience, anywhere, finds this graphic filth- which
should by all rights be considered child pornography- entertaining at
all is yet another sad indication that our civilization is beyond all
hope. The violence in this film is so gratuitous, so disturbing,
especially because it involved such a young girl, that it really
wouldn&#x27;t be any more offensive if the preteen actress was wandering
around naked and having sex with adults, instead of gleefully murdering
them.<br /><br />If there is any justice in this world, &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; will continue to
under perform at the box office. The less money it makes, the better.
