What in the world???? HOW does this movie have so many good reviews? It
was awful! I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I only caved
because of it&#x27;s ongoing good rating. I had a feeling about 10 minutes
into it, that it was not going to get any better and unfortunately I
was right.<br /><br />First of all, I thought that this was supposed to be a comedy? It is in
no way a comedy. It is extremely violent and full of blood (who would
have thought?!) I do not know the last time that I saw a movie this
bad. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There are
just so many things wrong with it. I also have a huge problem with an
11 year old girl being a killer. That really disturbed me. This movie
had no idea what it wanted to be. There are so many different genres
wrapped into it. It had absolutely no flow to it whatsoever. I love a
good movie, regardless of its genre but this movie flat out sucked! It
was completely inappropriate. I honestly felt like one of those people
on the show Punkd while I was watching this. I felt like this movie had
to be a joke.<br /><br />AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
