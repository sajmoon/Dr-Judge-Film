Kick Ass is nothing but a mediocre film.<br /><br />It is not an awful movie, neither it&#x27;s outstanding. Let&#x27;s see: <br /><br />(1) The plot: a guys sees how the city is ruled by bad people and
thinks &#x22;it would be awesome that someone stood up and fought them... an
average joe that decided to face them&#x22;. Our main character does that
role. Not outstanding, bot awful. Just mediocre.<br /><br />(2) Performances: all the main actors fit their roles, all of them
deliver. Though they are not outstanding, neither awful. They are just
mediocre.<br /><br />(3) Camera arrangements: they are not excellent, neither bad. Simply
mediocre.<br /><br />So, we have a movie that is simply mediocre.<br /><br />Now, why does it have an identity crisis? - Because the movie has some
fun moments, but they are not fun enough to make you roll over the
floor laughing.<br /><br />- Because the movie has some action scenes, but they are mild. I mean
you see blood (let me talk about that later), but there is no climax.
You see some bullets fly, some kills, but no intensity.<br /><br />- Because the movie has some gory situations, but not enough to call it
a gore movie. I mean, you see some blood splats, but nothing else. No
intensity.<br /><br />- Because it tries to be a teenager movie (they typical class loser
that wants to get the nice girl and can&#x27;t), but it does not have the
plot elements. No tension created. Suddenly from one moment to the
other, the guy snaps his finger and gets the girl.<br /><br />- Because there are no decent criminals. I mean, criminals are
laughable, but not laughable enough for a comedy. They are wannabe
bad-guys, but they are too serious too be in a comedy and too silly to
be in a crime movie.<br /><br />For all these reasons, you finish watching the movie and you ask
yourself: is this supposed to be a comedy, an action movie or what?
Like in any mediocre film, when you end seeing it, you feel that you
spent 90 minutes watching a movie that was like &#x22;meh.... okay. Ummmm...
got to take out the garbage. Yeah.&#x22;. You don&#x27;t complain saying it was a
waste of time, but you neither say &#x22;hell yeah.... this was good movie&#x22;.<br /><br />So, in the end, Kickass is condemned to fall into oblivion.
