2010_April 17 
When I first saw the trailer, I dismissed it thinking that it would be
another gross out teen comedy but when some of friends asked if I
wanted to see it, I decided to join them whilst going in with an open
mind and the result is amazing! The film maintains being funny from
start to finish whilst being able to have a very dark and sad scene at
the same time.<br /><br />I watched this film over a week ago and thought carefully before giving
it a 10 but the film deserves it. This is because it blends cool action
scenes (Nicolas Cage has a great fight scene), witty dialogue and
likable characters together. <br /><br />The story runs smoothly and I never found the story boring. Where the
Spiderman films failed, this makes up for it. I have to say though that
I enjoyed this film a lot more than the Spiderman, X-Men and Hulk films
because Kick Ass&#x27; director, Matthew Vaughn, keeps you entertained by
introducing something cool and interesting or something that you did
not see coming. <br /><br />The acting is also great with Nicolas Cage giving a strong performance
as Big Daddy, the super hero role that he was looking for and not Ghost
Rider. Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl is also very good saying things that
are indeed questionable but they are far and few between. Aaron Johnson
as Kick Ass gives a very good performance in a role that will surely
make him a recognisable star in good time.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for something that
will be entertaining but also has a great story. There are a lot of
cool action sequences such as one where they make reference Call of
Duty, which I know will be more than enough to attract young people in.
The director has a great understanding of how to use music in his
films, similar to what he did in Layer Cake and he does it again here,
assisting in making this a fantastic film.
