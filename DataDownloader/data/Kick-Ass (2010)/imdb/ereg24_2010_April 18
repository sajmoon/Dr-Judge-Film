You get Kick-Ass. Definitely a movie with more good than bad, Kick-Ass
is far from a perfect film.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that this film is great fun, but not for
everybody. While I personally had a fantastic time watching some of the
more gratuitously violent scenes in film history, I would encourage
anybody with a weak constitution for blood and dismemberment to skip
this one (it is rated R for a very good reason).<br /><br />What Kick-Ass offers is a surprisingly intelligent take on the idea of
costumed heroism and an incredibly violent spin on your typical coming
of age teen comedy. Throughout the wry satire movie patrons will find
themselves on a roller coaster of crime fighting fun. Unfortunately
this works to the films disadvantage. Kick-Ass is ultimately too
concept driven for mass appeal, and when you couple the movies bipolar
jumps from ultra violence to teenage sexual frustration with a rather
simple story and you have a film that will be incredibly hard-pressed
to win over the art house film buffs. Kick-Ass is (much like the films
protagonist) in an awkward spot between mature and adult and trite and
juvenile.<br /><br />But if you fall into the films demographic you will find a very
enjoyable experience. The acting is largely fantastic though I did find
Christopher Mintz-Plasse&#x27;s (Red Mist) performance to be very weak when
placed next to Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl), who steels the show, and
Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy), who delivers one of his best performances in
recent years.<br /><br />Ultimately Kick-Ass is a fun violence filled romp that I personally
look forward to adding into my movie collection. That being said it&#x27;s a
move that keeps closer company with Transformers than The Dark Knight.
I cannot stress enough how this film is violent but if the idea of an
11 year old girl slaughtering people amuses you than Kick-Ass just
might be the best way to spend your day at the moves.
