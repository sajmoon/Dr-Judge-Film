Kick ass starts as it means to go on. A shocking and hilarious scene
sees a wannabe superhero attempt to fly and then pludges to his death.
The music starts, the film begins, and hell, it gets better and
better... Introducing Dave with a smooth and funny voice-over, kick ass
is an unorthodox origins story. With Nic cage and mark strong as the
biggest stars in this, the film has a lot of unknowns,but they don&#x27;t
look at all out of their depth. Aaron Johnson is great as the wannabe
superhero who&#x27;s name is in the title, Chris-mintz plasse is very funny
as red mist too, but the real standouts are Chloe Moretz as hit-girl
and Nic cage as Big Daddy. These two are absolutely fantastic together,
and share some hilarious scenes, which I&#x27;m not going to ruin for you.
Moretz steals the show as the foul-mouthed 11 year old vigilante
Hit-girl, who&#x27;s character says the c word and many other
unmentionables, and she delivers then with brilliant confidence and
gusto that you can&#x27;t help but shout out with laughter at. Nic cage
looks back to his best and funniest, all charisma and gung ho. Vaugn
has delivered something wonderful, and at times a bit vulgar. Kick-ass
is a brilliant and ridiculously entertaining twist on the predictable
and down right boring superhero genre, with comedy, and action that
compares to that of dark knight, with added blood and awesomeness.If
you want to have a beaming, toothy grin on your face, watch this, it
kicks ass, literally.
