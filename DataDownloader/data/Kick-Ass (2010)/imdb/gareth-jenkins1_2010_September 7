Finally a film that lives up to the promise of the trailer! This film
is more than just very funny and terrific (and very gory)entertainment,
it has hidden depths.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a journey that starts from light-hearted funny teen-comedy then
gradually becomes deeper, darker and more powerful as it goes on. I
actually found the last 30 minutes or so to be powerful and emotionally
moving.<br /><br />The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, the visual style is
beautiful, the music is absolutely perfect - the combination of all 3
in synergy at times touch on perfect cinema and had me laughing with
tears in my eyes - only a few films have ever achieved this.<br /><br />Acting performances are also top-notch.<br /><br />In short you get what you expect (refreshingly so) from this movie, and
surprisingly a whole lot more!
