There&#x27;s painfully dull and then there&#x27;s outright insulting and this
movie is definitely in the latter category. This sorry excuse of a
movie offends me in the same way that &#x22;Police Academy 7&#x22; and &#x22;Lawnmower
Man 2&#x22; did. Frankly, it might have the worst quality/budget quotient of
any movie ever made. Hmm, no that would be &#x22;Hook&#x22;. Anyway, if this
extremely low-brow piece of offal is anything like the original graphic
novel I am beside myself with joy that it has never been on here in the
Russian Federation.<br /><br />Was anybody else let down by this movie? Not that I expected an academy
award worthy film but The Brady Bunch movie is a winner compared to
this subhuman tripe. Following the movie, my friends and I demanded our
money back from the manager of the theater. He explained that, since it
was a free screening, he couldn&#x27;t give us anything in return, no matter
how much agony we were suffering through.
