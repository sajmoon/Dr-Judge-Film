This movie should be rounded up and destroyed, all copies thrown into a
big pile and set ablaze. I know I would enjoy that, such a god awful
film, Jesus would roll over in his grave if he knew such a travesty
existed. If I was bitten by a bear, I have to say I&#x27;d enjoy it more
than this movie. This makes Uwe Boll look like an Otto Priminger! How
could such an awful movie be allowed to exist yet alone actually be
made? Studio security should have shut this project down themselves the
second they seen it being made. Why didn&#x27;t they!? Why!!! How much money
were they paid to stay their firearms!??! HOW MUCH I ASK! HOW MUCH
MONEY WERE THEIR SOULS WORTH?!?!??????!! seen this movie the other
night and I can tell you without a doubt it&#x27;s the worst movie ever. The
plot is stupid, everything about it is stupid. I hope the people
involved in this movie die of the plague, or at least have their
careers destroyed so they can never work in the movie business again.
My god, whoever likes this movie should burn for all eternity. Then
because the Public, who complains so much about this Movie, do not fall
for the hype and are nourished by good Movies, such as &#x22; Sex and the
City 2 &#x22;, or, &#x22; Akeelah and The Bee &#x22;.<br /><br />Another bad movie of this year was &#x22; Date Movie &#x22;, and that? 44 Million
Dollars in DVD rentals, almost what accumulates in the Cinemas.<br /><br />Then that happens? If we do not stop watching stupid Movies, the
entertainment industry will never stop putting forth these bad(wrong)
films since big bucks are thereby generated.<br /><br />&#x22; Akeelah and The Bee &#x22; is a Good Movie, but it did not have anything
of a hearing.<br /><br />Since It can be , that a sorrow(sentence) gives me, that this Movie
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, accumulates more in DVD office sales than the Excellent
Movie of Suspense &#x22;Savage Harvest 2: October Blood&#x22;, ah and bearing it
in mind that &#x22;Kick-Ass &#x22; tape-worm the variant of Superhero of Movie &#x22;
The Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&#x22;.<br /><br />Analyze this Commentary and if it is not true what I have just written
or not...
