Ass needs kicked like Vogue have declared it reject stock, and there is
only one man who believes he is suited to the task. When I say man, I
mean a New York High school student, and just because he believes he is
the only one, does not make it so.<br /><br />From the outset we are lead into the idea of Superheroes and the
Geek-favoured debate of &#x27;why does nobody ever try to be a Superhero?&#x27;.
Fair enough comment I&#x27;d say. The answer shortly comes along to
Kick-Ass, that people are either too scared to react to criminal acts,
or they will in fact get their asses handed to them on a plate. He thus
takes it upon himself to intervene in a fight that is not his to be
involved in.<br /><br />Joe Public uploads footage from this ass whopping, served up by
Kick-Ass to a group of thugs, and notoriety follows, merchandise
released and the introduction (though only to Kick Ass himself) of two
other vigilante heroes. Big Daddy and Hit Girl.<br /><br />With a father-daughter relationship most father&#x27;s would love to have,
and daughters wouldn&#x27;t, Big Daddy and Hit Girl are a hard-impacting,
weapon-toting, deadly duo not to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Vengeance is the motive for this pair of silent killers. Having kept
their hero persona&#x27;s private, the sudden emergence of Kick-Ass to the
&#x27;lime light&#x27;, firstly takes any suspicion that would be creeping up at
them, away, but could prove to make their job harder. However, could
Kick Ass be more of an advantage to them than they realise? With start
to end action, quips aplenty, even a love story that does not make you
gag, this is what geeks and nerds alike dream of, becoming a Superhero.<br /><br />Whether you are into comics or not, prefer romantic comedies to action
films, this picture is a must-see by all. I dare you to watch and not
laugh at least once. I dare you to not come away from this with your
own hero outfit and name planned. Double Dare!
