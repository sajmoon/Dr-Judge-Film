When I saw this back in the cinema, I had no idea what it was about. I
didn&#x27;t know what to expect and only know the basic plot. The movie came
out as a Kill-Bill meets Spider-Man and Watchmen movie. It was a nice
surprise, and definitely worth seeing (the person I saw it with wanted
to see it again!) Kick-Ass follows a teenager in High School who
wonders what it would be like to be a superhero and decides to be one
himself: Kick-Ass. He stumbles upon other people following the same
routine as him, but discovers its not that easy to pull it off in the
real world.<br /><br />Like I said, if you had no idea what it was about. Then you&#x27;ll probably
end up liking it a lot, and the movie is quite gory for what it is.
Make no mistake, this is not a movie for children! I am glad to have
seen this, and all the cast was great in it too! (Yep, even Nicolas
Cage!). The movie in my opinion was not advertised enough (at least not
in the UK) and I think quite a lot of people are going to miss it, but
who knows.
