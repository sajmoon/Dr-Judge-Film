I saw this movie come up on my Netflix On Demand &#x27;recommended&#x27; list,
and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Of course, I had already heard all
about it and was definitely curious to see what all the hype was about,
and although I do enjoy the genre in general, I was certainly not
expecting to love this movie as much as I did. In fact, one might say
that I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. <br /><br />Yes, I know it&#x27;s wrong to see an eleven year old girl gleefully
dismember bad guys. Yes, I know that vigilantism is nothing to
advocate. And yes, I also know that if an average high school nerd put
on a pair of tights and decided to fight crime, he&#x27;d likely end up
dead. <br /><br />I can happily put all those concerns aside though, because the fact is
that this is a tremendously well made film with a solid plot and
characters you genuinely care about. The acting is superb, particularly
by young Chloe Moretz who is surely a superstar in the making. The
director obviously had a very clear vision of what he wanted this movie
to be, and he hit a home run in execution. <br /><br />If I had to pick out something that I didn&#x27;t like, it would be that
most of the street scenes which are supposed to be New York City are
pretty obviously not (as a native New Yorker this annoys me quite a
bit)... I realize this was likely a budget issue, but its still
something noticeable. The only other thing I would possibly complain
about is that I feel the jetpack/gatling gun gadget that Kick Ass used
in the end was just a tiny bit too much... I think they could have
accomplished that scene a little better. But honestly, these are very
minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding film. <br /><br />Yes, it&#x27;s not a movie for everyone, and there are going to be many
people who aren&#x27;t going to be able to get past the imagery of a
tarted-up preteen girl brutally killing criminals while making profane
wisecracks. And that&#x27;s fine... I totally understand where they&#x27;re
coming from. But if you can briefly suspend your own sense of reality
for a couple of hours, you&#x27;re sure to enjoy it.
