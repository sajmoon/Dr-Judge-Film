With all of the super hero movies recently there was bound to be a
funny parody in the works and I&#x27;m glad that it didn&#x27;t come in the form
of a Scary Movie abomination. What drives this movie is pretty much
people getting the crap beat out of them and how it can be both
entertaining and funny. This movie pulls no punches in terms of
violence and dialogue, especially when you watch a 12-year old girl
slice up gangsters like cold cuts while using language that would make
your mother cringe. I&#x27;m not sure who played Kick-Ass in this movie but
Michael Cera and McLovin don&#x27;t have the awkward teen market cornered
anymore. This is a movie that&#x27;s best enjoyed with a packed theater so
go see it sooner than later and expect a grittier and ballsier super
hero movie like Watchmen with more jokes and less blue penis.
