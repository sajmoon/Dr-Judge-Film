Kick-ass is awesome! (Just a short tribute, nothing special to say)<br /><br />This was a real superhero movie. In the beginning I was a bit skeptical
about having to watch a movie in this genre, which was only 30 mil. in
production budget. Seriously the Spider man movies ran from 140 mil. to
257 mil. in budget and this movie kicked their ass!<br /><br />The acting was brilliant with a strong story, so it was certainly
surprising to see so little turned into to something so great. Further
more this is the first movie in a long time that made Nicholas Cage
look good. This a good part for him. The music score compliments the
storytelling and sets the mood for an exiting and fun adventure.<br /><br />For all who love superhero movies this is a must see!! No question
about it.
