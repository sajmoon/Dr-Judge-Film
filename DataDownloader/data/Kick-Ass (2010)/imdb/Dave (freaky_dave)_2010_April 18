I&#x27;ve heard some people complaining about this movie because it involves
a little girl who curses and kills bad guys at random. We have to take
into consideration that this is a comic book satire, and is not meant
to be taken seriously. It is rated R for a reason because little kids
are not suppose to be watching it. The only problem I have with any of
this is the parents that would take their small children to see this.
That is completely wrong. Now here&#x27;s my review.<br /><br />I found Kick Ass to be hysterical and over the top. It reminded me a
lot of Kill Bill 1 and 2, and I enjoyed those two movies as well. The
killings in Kick Ass are graphic and appalling, but that&#x27;s what the
film is meant to be, a graphic description of a comic book series. I
can include the movie Sin City, another good film, in this as well, and
I can tell you that both Kill Bill films and Sin City are much more
bloodier than Kick Ass. I don&#x27;t understand the opinions from critics,
most of whom enjoyed the Kill Bill movies and Sin City, who find that
Kick Ass is a little too much for their tastes. That is being
hypocritical, and that is not the way a critic should review any
movies.<br /><br />THe acting for the most part was well done. Nicolas Cage hams it up and
does a good job while not taking the material seriously. I got a sense
that he was copying Adam West from the old Batman series in the 60s,
and he does a fine job. Aaron Johnson, who plays Kick Ass, reminded me
a lot of Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man movies in the way he handled
his part. Both Mark Strong (Frank D&#x27;Amico) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse
(Chris D&#x27;Amico/Red Mist) have good supporting roles, but the person
that real grabbed most of my interest was Chloe Moretz, who play Hit
Girl. Whenever she appears, no matter if she is just talking or kicking
ass, she takes the role and runs with it, and just about takes over the
movie where we nearly forget about the character of Kick Ass.<br /><br />Kick Ass is an entertaining movie that grabbed my interest from the
beginning, and never grows dull. THe humor is there along with all the
blood shed. It is an insane film that keeps you watching until the end.
It is not a great film, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. It was just
the type of action movie that we don&#x27;t see much of anymore, even if the
killer, most of the time, is an eleven year old girl.
