Why don&#x27;t people just put on capes and try to be superheroes? Because
they would likely get themselves killed on their first night out. We
meet Dave (Aaron Johnson) in high school when reading too many comic
books has given him the idea that he should become a superhero. He
becomes &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;.<br /><br />The character of Dave gives this movie the most brilliantly funny start
to any movie even close to the comic book, or action, or even comedy
genre. Writing that smart and that funny is not expected in a movie
like this. And by &#x22;this&#x22;, I mean a movie where bad guys have guns, and
more bad guys have more guns, and then trained assassins have even more
guns.<br /><br />The &#x22;trained assassins&#x22; part is where Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big
Daddy (Nicolas Cage) come in. Most people like Cage in his annual
action role, but this is better, his comedic delivery is a sort of
self-mockery and it&#x27;s perfect. Hit-Girl and young actress Moretz are
what sets this film apart and will determine whether or not you&#x27;ll like
it. Hit-Girl kills people. That&#x27;s all she knows how to do. Some
reviewers, like Roger Ebert, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s funny when 11 year-old
girls kill people (a lot of people). I happen to agree with him, but
this movie has a lot of fans that don&#x27;t agree. Moretz is like a cute,
young, female Jackie Chan. For fanboys who like martial arts movies
that is like hitting the jackpot.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t like comic books, I don&#x27;t like comic book movies, and I really
don&#x27;t like martial arts movies. I can like action movies if they give
me solid characters to believe in. That&#x27;s what &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; did and I
liked it. Hit-Girl sent my head spinning but that&#x27;s not necessarily a
bad thing.
