The great thing about movies that enter the realm of super heroes is
that nothing is over the top. Anything goes, and that is precisely why
I read comics while growing up. The sixties were a different era of
course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the
entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination
roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while I studied and
imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27;, I
did exactly as I did so many years ago. Sit back and hopefully, watch
in awe.<br /><br />The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very
important due to many not having read the &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; series. I had
never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough.
So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of
seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they
did.<br /><br />The rise of &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; was due to frustration with the status-quo. You
don&#x27;t have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the
second ingredient to becoming &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; (courage) that is uncommon. So
young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the
catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an
alter-ego &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; and sets out to make a difference in his world.
Along the way, he&#x27;ll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition
can be a two-edged sword.<br /><br />Each page of &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; yields additions to the film that are a
surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the
ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he&#x27;ll be
reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book
writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace
Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the
movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I&#x27;m
not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch
the movie and let the story evolve.<br /><br />The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers
worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a
fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and
writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there
will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After
all, there&#x27;s a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must
entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school.
