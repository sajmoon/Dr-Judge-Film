I made the mistake (thanks to the advertising) of thinking this was
supposed to be a fun, teen comedy about some hapless youngsters getting
together to become crimefighters. I was off by a disturbing amount. I
was genuinely offended by the violence, killing, horrible language and
maimings. This is not a film for kids, so the R rating is justified,
but it&#x27;s also not funny or cute. Don&#x27;t let the fun trailers and that
kid from Superlame fool you, this is a gory, violent film. However, if
you go into it looking for old DVD disc to be used a drink coaster or
mini-frizbee, you shan&#x27;t be let down. I blame the ad campaign and
casting for preparing me for something fun. What I got was something
truly nasty like Brokeback Mountain..
