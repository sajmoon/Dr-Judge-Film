I&#x27;m not going to repeat the plot outline because that&#x27;s been done in
all the other reviews so I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet. Kick-Ass has
raised the bar for the rest of the summer films headed our way. If any
of them are as entertaining as this, then I&#x27;ll sell the computer I&#x27;m
typing this on. Every character is so well done, the action is
top-drawer and the dialogue, well, it&#x27;s razor sharp. Especially
anything that comes out of Hit-Girl&#x27;s mouth.<br /><br />And it really is her movie. Chloe Moretz is one hell of a discovery and
is destined to be forever remembered for this role, her debut, and THAT
line. She simply dominates every scene she&#x27;s in and is one-to-watch for
the future. Her along with Nic Cage are simply outstanding and it&#x27;s so
nice to see an actor of his calibre doing something decent after what
seems like an eternity of making dross. Mark Strong is also brilliant
and actually gets some of the films best lines.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t find fault with this film. As well as being a)very, very funny
and b)a corking action picture it is also a very subtle critique on the
whole notion of celebrity and wanting to be famous and the crazed
impersonators it encourages and the resulting swamp of money that can
be made from it. But that&#x27;s not really the point of Kick-Ass now is it?
It&#x27;s an entertainment first and foremost and I honestly can&#x27;t remember
the last time I saw a film that was this much fun. The blackest of
humour, the slickest comic-book violence - all put together with oodles
of confidence by Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman, who after
Layer Cake, Stardust and now this, are fast becoming the best creative
double-act in Britain. It only makes you wonder what Vaughn could have
done with X-Men 3, considering the budget for that was about $150m and
Kick-Ass had a budget of $28m. After Kick-Ass, the movie world will
hopefully be his oyster, and rightly so.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is out in the UK already but to readers from the US, you
should be very excited, because you&#x27;re about to get your ass kicked by
the first genuine candidate for film of the year!
