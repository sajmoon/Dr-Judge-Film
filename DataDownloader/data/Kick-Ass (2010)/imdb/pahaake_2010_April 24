I don&#x27;t want to ruin this for anyone - but it&#x27;s not what you expect.
It&#x27;s hilariously funny in a very wrong way that you have to see.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz makes this movie everything it is, the rest of the cast
could not even be in the movie and it would still rock. In fact, she
makes this movie a 10. Go see it or you&#x27;ll be sorry. It&#x27;s slick, sick,
and funny - it&#x27;s got everything you need in a movie. Chloe Moretz&#x27;s
character is wickedly awesome and makes you eager for a sequel.<br /><br />Even Cage, who&#x27;s career is pretty much over, was decent in this movie.
You simply have to see it - I won&#x27;t tell you what it&#x27;s about - just go
see it!
