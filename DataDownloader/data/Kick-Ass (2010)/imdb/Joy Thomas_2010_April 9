Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect going into this one as I&#x27;m not a huge fan of
superhero films and the adverts didn&#x27;t give much away, but I was amazed
at how good it was. Great soundtrack, really good acting and original
storyline - somehow managed to be funny, dramatic and action-packed all
in one without compromising any of them. <br /><br />Hit-girl definitely stole the show for me - something very amusing
about a sweet and innocent looking little girl decapitating people and
using profanity. Nicholas Cage was also very good in my opinion, as was
Red Mist.<br /><br />Well worth a watch on the big screen for almost any film fan - just be
warned that it&#x27;s not as child-friendly as the trailers may appear.
There are at least a couple of pretty gritty scenes which I would be
uncomfortable really with any child seeing.
