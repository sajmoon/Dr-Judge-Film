I won&#x27;t go as far to say this is the best movie of all time. But, after
seeing the garbage that was Clash of the Titans before this in
theaters, it feels like it could be considered the best. But, that&#x27;s a
different movie, so, different review. I did enjoy this movie
thoroughly. Of course it had its downsides, but what movie doesn&#x27;t? I
see so many complaints about Chloe as Hit-Girl, and all I can do is
praise her. Children tend to ruin movies for me, but, this was not that
case. This movie was brilliant because of her. The amount of
seriousness mixed with childishness was hilarious and entertaining as
hell. <br /><br />Nicholas Cage, I will honestly say, every movie I have ever seen him
in, I have no enjoyed. Movies such as, Ghost Rider, National Treasure,
The Wicker Man, all these movies made me want to cry. But, in Kick Ass,
I couldn&#x27;t help but love him. He felt so cheesy and dumb, but, that&#x27;s
the kind of movie this is. He was a stereotype that people have seem to
have forgotten, and he played it beautifully and he had me laughing
whenever he was on screen. And not to mention, his action scene was
pretty bad ass. <br /><br />Christopher Mintz-Plasse, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of. Superbad was a rather
awful movie, and he didn&#x27;t make me go crazy in this film. Something
about this guy just makes me hate, it&#x27;s probably his voice, and the
goofy look that is ever present on his face. He could have easily been
left out of this movie for all I cared.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson I think I will look forward to in the future. I liked the
way he did the roll in this, his voice got a bit old and he seemed to
be trying far to hard to have a geeky attitude, when we knew it was
there. Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It was funny, the
action was good, and the story wasn&#x27;t God awful. It didn&#x27;t take itself
too seriously, but when it did, it did it well.
