If you see every superhero movie, if you appreciate Superman more than
the average bear, if you get the sense that you have a little too much
faith in superheroes, this might just be the movie for you. However,
it&#x27;d probably be best if you like a film like &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; and/or the
&#x22;Kill Bills&#x22; too because there is lots of violence and lots of filthy
language in this one. Confused yet? <br /><br />This film is about some regular-that is to say anonymous-high
schoolers, who are frustrated in understanding girls, they like comic
books, they mercilessly insult one another-but in a friendly way. Well,
one of these boys, Dave (Aaron Johnson-likable in a shaggy-dog way and
well-chosen for the part), in the midst of one the endless neurotic,
intense conversations that teenagers have about the course of their
lives, about members of the opposite sex, about things they like,
concludes that there&#x27;s no reason why a superhero shouldn&#x27;t try and save
the world. So he sets out to be that superhero, making his own
hilariously tacky superhero costume and finding himself in over his
head when he realizes that knives will still injure him. It&#x27;s inspiring
the degree to which he believes one person can make a difference and
quite funny but as audience members, we obviously know that he doesn&#x27;t
really have any superpowers and that if his attempt to disarm the bad
guys fail, that he will be seriously injured. Dave&#x27;s sweet naivet&#xE9; is
the very trait however, which buys him the good-will that ensures we
will root for and follow his adventures throughout the film.<br /><br />Like Tarantino, this film combines some rather mundane characters and
some rather outrageous escapades. However, because the characters&#x27;
reactions are so sensible and identifiable, we don&#x27;t squirm or root
against them. The things that they do and say seem like sensible
responses to events which occur in their life. It is precisely the
earthiness of the characters that keeps the plot from seeming
exploitative or outrageous. <br /><br />As the movie continues, Dave knows that his superhero powers are
limited but it doesn&#x27;t diminish his desire to do some good. However, he
is more realistic about the challenges he can surmount and after he
lowers his expectations, he is able to do some good. In doing some
good, he crosses paths with another young, would-be superhero, Hit-Girl
(played with ruthless cuteness by the talented young actress Chloe
Moretz, who I&#x27;m sure we will be hearing more of) who gallivants around
town, attempting to right wrong although it turns out, her actions are
not motivated simply by a desire to impose moral order in the world.
Her father is Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage playing with abandon and panache
and reminding us once again just how talented he can be when he decides
not to cash in for an easy check) and he&#x27;s the most immoral father you
have ever seen on screen, I&#x27;d venture to guess. Also excellent in the
film are Frank D&#x27;Amico as ruthless mob boss Mark Strong and his needy
son Chris D&#x27;Amico (played with a wonderful playfulness by Chris
Mintz-Plasse of &#x22;McLovin&#x22; fame). The supporting roles are also filled
quite adequately by a variety of lesser lights. <br /><br />The tone of this film might be the most impressive thing over which
director Matthew Arnold has control. On the one hand, the violence is
so graphic that if one were to allow it without leavening it with
fairly mundane characters, the film would be rather sensationalist. On
the other hand, if he allowed his characters to talk and be neurotic
too much, it would be just another neurotic fanboy film about teenagers
much too obsessed with superheroes. As it is, the director has struck a
nice balance, playing the naivet&#xE9; of teenagers off the wild, anarchic
results of some sensible decisions. The movie feels like a Tarantino
film-intelligent people who like to discuss things combined with some
graphic violence. Like Tarantino&#x27;s flics, the choice of music is
crucial and helpful in establishing the direction of the film also.<br /><br />The screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Arnold, and the
(presumably) excellent comic book by John Romita Jr. and Mark Millar
are, as said, very good. It would have been very easy to go wrong with
the tone, and that Arnold captures regular people who recognize their
limitations but who strive on all the same, often to hilarious and
clever results, is a tribute to Arnold&#x27;s management of the tone and
direction of the film.
