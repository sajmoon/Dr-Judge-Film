All I can say is that I was in no way interested in watching this movie
at all. But my friend &#x26; finally decided to watch it last night &#x26; I must
say it&#x27;s 1 one of the best movies I have seen. Full of action &#x26; fun!
The acting was great! I especially enjoyed watching Chloe Grace! She
was a beast!!<br /><br />I was a bit surprised to see Nicolas Cage play the role he played. But
as usual, he did a great job. <br /><br />The plot/story line was good &#x26; kept my attention. Everything gelled
together nicely surprisingly. It was nothing like I expected it to be.
I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! If you don&#x27;t see anything else, see this
movie!
