What Can I say about Kick-Ass. Well, for starters, it definitely lives
up to it&#x27;s name. It is also a very funny High School film that takes
place in the world of superheroes (well, in their won world). The film
has a clever and outrageous screenplay. It is daring and original in
it&#x27;s approach, and these days that is hard to come by. It reminds me of
Sin City in it&#x27;s totally unrated but fun tone, although in a lighter
way. This film crosses so many different films, like Superbad, Kill
Bill, Adventureland and combines them to this very entertaining and
energetic film. I am not sure that every scene works, but that&#x27;s
because the film has incredibly contrasting tones at times. It is an
action film, a comedy, a high school romance, and a crime film, and it
succeeds in all of those genres. This film is definitely outlandish and
will offend many people because of it&#x27;s hard rating and the violence
portrayed by kids and to kids. But this is a film that has ambition,
and joins the ranks of the best comic book films in the last 10 years
together with The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Sin City, because like all
of them, it is not merely satisfied with being your average Spider-Man
film. Oh, and the soundtrack is KILLER!
