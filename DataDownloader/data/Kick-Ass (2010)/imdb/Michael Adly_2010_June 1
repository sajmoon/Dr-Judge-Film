Kick Ass...Entertaining but a little less than its name!<br /><br />Once you see the trailer of this movie you know you&#x27;re in for something
special and a lot more than ordinary. Kick Ass is anything but
ordinary. But beware, this is actually tailored to a certain chunk of
the audience and for them it will really kick ass. For others it may be
just OK and for many, trust me, it will be ridiculous.<br /><br />Kick Ass is about Dave, a high school nerd, unsurprisingly a fan of
comic books, who decides to become a superhero since no one has done it
before in the real world. As the story of him becoming a vigilante goes
on, he meets other real world superheroes and gets involved in a quest
of brining down a drug lord and his gang.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed it, I have to say the ratings, which are through
the roof, sort of ruined what could have been a more pleasant
experience for me. It made my expectations go so high, I spent the
whole movie on waiting mode, holding my breath for something magical to
happen so that I can meet those expectations. America has always
overrated whatever fell in what I call the rule of four: vampires,
aliens, dinosaurs and blood (you thought I was gonna say superheroes,
didn&#x27;t you?). Kick Ass falls in the last category, with bad guys
brutally murdered, burned, sliced and in one part grinded and that, for
many, could be the main reason they&#x27;d watch a movie and actually laugh.<br /><br />Actors of Kick Ass are actually a great fit despite their diversity,
mainly of age, which I believe is one of the reasons for the movie&#x27;s
great reception. The humour is also enjoyable for the most part. And
what&#x27;s special about it is that it actually has a story to follow which
is usually a rare factor in similar films. But on a moral level, I&#x27;m
just not sure that a 10 year old girl shooting and savagely killing big
guys is a great idea. It is to some extent fun to watch, but may not be
for everyone.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is not one of the best movies ever, like listed on
some websites but it is definitely funny and entertaining. It is rated
R, so no kids (talk about irony). But if you are in the mood for some
kids running around chasing bad guys, I say grab the pop corn and play
this one on.
