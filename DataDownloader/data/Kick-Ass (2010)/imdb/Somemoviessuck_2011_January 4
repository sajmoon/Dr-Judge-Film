I saw this movie a few months ago because it looked cool in previews.
I&#x27;d also heard from many people that it was great. After watching it
and then seeing how others felt I was shocked. This movie was BAD. The
story and romance were clich&#xE9;, the characters were poorly developed and
not very likable, the acting was godawful especially by that idiot
Nicholas Cage, and the other part I enjoyed was the cinematography. The
movie itself is all over the place... first about a kid who wants to
impress a girl and fight crime, then it becomes about completely
different actual &#x27;superheroes&#x27;. A movie that features a father who
teaches his daughter to murder people is a little absurd... and the
amount of people they kill is baffling. Horribly clich&#xE9;, stereotypical
teen movie about being unpopular and then about action and killing.<br /><br />See this movie if you are: a prepubescent emo kid. Do not see this
movie if you: actually like movies that include good acting.<br /><br />Unbelievable as to how this movie got an 8.0... absolutely terrible.
