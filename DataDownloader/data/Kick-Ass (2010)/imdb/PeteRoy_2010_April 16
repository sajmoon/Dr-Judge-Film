This movie shows you a lot of cruel torture scenes that end up with the
victim killed violently.<br /><br />These scenes made me sick and I had to walk out of the movie because I
was so disgusted.<br /><br />There were cool moments in the movie but they were all destroyed once
you see someone being smashed in a car to death or any of the other
torture scenes.<br /><br />Ironically the movie shows you these scenes as something to laugh
about, as if seeing someone begging not to die is funny to watch, I
didn&#x27;t appreciate that and I don&#x27;t want to see it, especially not when
I paid money to watch a movie.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage, I don&#x27;t enjoy seeing him on screen anymore.<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t like seeing cruel anti human scenes then don&#x27;t waste your
time on this movie.
