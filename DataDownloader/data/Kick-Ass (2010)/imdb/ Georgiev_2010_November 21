I am a 23 years old men who sometimes enjoys downloading and watching
good movies on his computer. IMDb has always had a surprisingly
accurate rating system and eased me very much with picking up good
movies to watch (which i appreciate very much ). <br /><br />I saw this movie a couple of months ago... I was very unpleasantly
surprised ! I can watch any genre of movies. Even if the topic is not
among my favorites, I can still Appreciate and enjoy a good
cinematography , story, effects, actor&#x27;s play etc. <br /><br />The problem with this particular title however was that it did NOT have
any of this characteristics of a good movie. I would usually just stop
watching a movie which is THAT BAD as kick- ass, but because of the
high rating I kept on watching hoping for some surprising TWIST to
happen that will make any sense to all the pointless mess (plot wise )
happening on my screen. Unfortunately there wasn&#x27;t one.<br /><br />The movie left a very bad taste in my mouth, hoping for it to identify
itself - comedy ( RED ), action hero movie (SPIDER MAN ) special
effects (Transformers ) . I try not to judge people, but I can not help
to ask myself : Is this what is considered entertaining by teenage
audience ? I would very much like to have the option of filtering the
reviews here by age or something so I won&#x27;t need to take another
torture like Kick- ass again (excuse me :)<br /><br />This is what people that liked the movie say about it : &#x22;Pop Culture
and Silliness&#x22; &#x22; Weird &#x22; &#x22;entertainingly violent and care-free&#x22; &#x22; if
not as smart or as funny as it wants to be &#x22;. SO what&#x27;s left for all
the people that DID NOT like the movie ?
