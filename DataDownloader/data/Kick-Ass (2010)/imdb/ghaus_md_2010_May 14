It was a roller coaster ride from the beginning till the end.!!!!!!!
Just after the movie started i was glued to my seat.<br /><br />I never expected this movie to be so could . It is a movie bout
superheroes without one.All the characters performed brilliantly ,the
performance, the action scenes,the direction, the story line , the
characters,the costumes were just superb.....<br /><br />The movie is simple ,smart and intelligent the movie speaks for itself
,amongst all the characters HIT-GIRL is my personal favorite , KICK ASS
the main character of the movie played by Aaron Johnson, he is just
superb, when you watch the movie you actually tend to believe what all
is happening . This movie brings everybody&#x27;s dream of becoming a
superhero come true...<br /><br />The movie was such a &#x22;KICK-ASS&#x22;.
