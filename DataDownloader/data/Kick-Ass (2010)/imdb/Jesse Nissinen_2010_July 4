First of all they advertised this movie as a comedy, by making a short
trailer where you only see the character kick-ass and his jokes, then
you also get introduced to the other superhero characters, Red Mist,
Hit-Girl etc. however all this trailer takes up are family
comedy-scenes. Where there are very few off, and all of them can be
seen in the trailer.<br /><br />The intro of the movie is a comedy, made me laugh may I add. Then the
first &#x27;horror&#x27; scene comes in and I start thinking that this might be a
comedy/thriller kind of movie, like a superhero movie for adults.<br /><br />But then comes the main turning off point when we get introduced to
Hit-Girl, a 11 year old girl who they have taught to say all kind of
swearing words, matter of fact she seems to never say the same cussing
word two times, every new dialog or one-liner she has she will use a
new cussing word. Throughout the movie she have said more then 6+
cussing words that gave the movie R-rating in the first place.<br /><br />I looked up the Kick-ass thing on google after-wards and noticed the
whole movie is based on a GURO manga. Basically no-plot just ultra
violence and brutal murders. These guro mangas are banned or illegal in
most countries, so it&#x27;s just &#x27;f*cked up&#x27; they actually do and produce a
real movie of these, and make commercial for it to be FOR KIDS.<br /><br />People say it&#x27;s just a movie and don&#x27;t take it so seriously, I know
this, I don&#x27;t have anything against the ultra violence AKA Kill
Bill/Sin City style, those are all CGI anyways, so the 11 year old girl
actor is just jumping around with toy guns and having fun. But the fact
they actually taught her to swear like a grown up and having lots of
sexual knowledge a 11 year old shouldn&#x27;t have is just wrong in all
points, also in an interview she said she had read the guro mangas
herself, wow her parents seem to have no glue what the hell they are
doing.<br /><br />TO THE GOOD PARTS. This movie on the other hand delivers and there&#x27;s
some really good fighting scenes, familiar to Kill Bill meeting Matrix.
But unfortunately I can&#x27;t enjoy any of these because all of these
scenes are involved with a disturbed and damaged 11 year old little
girl.<br /><br />Even with the movie The Exorcist, they dubbed the girls voice by an
adult women, which means Linda Blair never said a single cursing word
in the whole movie, she was just miming other dialogs. Which isn&#x27;t the
case with Hit-Girl. Hit-Girl is actually saying all her own lines. It
gives the idea that her character have been sexually assaulted her
whole life, which we luckily never get to see, but wouldn&#x27;t have been
surprised if they had thrown in a child rape scene into this ruined
movie.<br /><br />0 Stars from 10 possible (BANNED).<br /><br />If the movie would have been made without Hit-Girl.<br /><br />8 Stars from 10. possible
