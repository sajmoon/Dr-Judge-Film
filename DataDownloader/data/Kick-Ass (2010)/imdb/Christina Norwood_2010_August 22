Many people mention that Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino was largely
inspired by Lady Snowblood, the 1973 Japanese revenge movie directed by
Toshiya Fujita and starring Meiko Kaji. The sub-plot in Kick Ass (Big
Daddy/Hit Girl story) is much closer to Lady Snowblood than Kill Bill
is, except that the female assassin is much younger and more
foul-mouthed.<br /><br />Having watched quite a few of these Japanese revenge-themed movies from
the 70s of late I think I&#x27;ve developed an appreciation of the genre.
Kick Ass fits in nicely, and the acting is superb. I hope Chloe Moretz
goes on to do as well as Meiko Kaji did.<br /><br />The main plot in Kick Ass has a lot of depth, touching on many
contemporary issues such as apathy, gay-bashing and school-yard
bullying under the guise of a coming-of-age story. I see more in it
every time I watch it (which has been quite a few times already). Aaron
Johnson does a great job with the role, struggling with all the moral
and personal issues that the movie raises.<br /><br />Some have criticised the movie for not fitting into any genre, but I
see it as being post-modern in it&#x27;s breaking out of genres and
reflecting on them in a way that transcends rather than satirizes.
