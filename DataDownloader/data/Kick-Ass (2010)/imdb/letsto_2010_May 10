This is a brutal and funny movie.<br /><br />A clever take on the super-hero genre.<br /><br />Well done and smart.<br /><br />Figured it would have been a bigger hit at box office. Guess the R
rating kept a lot of the target audience out.<br /><br />Fun and playful in an odd way.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does his best Adam West impersonation.<br /><br />Music keeps your feet taping all the way through.<br /><br />The little girl steals the show. She&#x27;s foul mouthed and tough.<br /><br />Downside is it felt a little reminiscent of Watchmen and Wanted.
