&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; sets out to lay waste to the archetypal superhero movie, but
some see the film as just another addition to the superhero genre.
Those who argue for satire point to the first half of the film, where
Aaron Johnson&#x27;s &#x22;everyman&#x22; character learns the hard way that becoming
a superhero isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks in movies like &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22; or
&#x22;Batman Begins.&#x22; You see, Kick-Ass earns a reputation as a superhero,
but he lacks the skills of the more covert Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, who
lurk in the shadows with high-grade weaponry and martial arts mastery.
While Hit-Girl and Big Daddy fight crime, Kick Ass must deal with the
everyday plagues of the American teen. In a funny bit, Kick Ass&#x27; alter
ego, Dave Lizewski, learns that the &#x22;love of his life&#x22; wants him to
be...well I won&#x27;t spoil it, but I will say that it stands in the way of
Dave&#x27;s dreams for a little while. <br /><br />Bits like that one enrich the first half of Kick Ass with a dose of
funny reality. Kick Ass comes off as kind of a loser, Hit-Girl looks
way too young to be saying the things she says (and doing the things
she does), and Nicolas Cage&#x27;s Big Daddy stands as one of his funniest
creations. He&#x27;s like an overbearing Little League parent on steroids.
Less funny are the villains. Mark Strong, an excellent actor, must play
a fairly bland crime kingpin. He does his best to enliven his
character&#x27;s dialogue, but he still comes across as a cross between
&#x22;Daredevil&#x27;s&#x22; Kingpin and &#x22;Iron Man&#x27;s&#x22; Obadiah Stane. This composite
villain has an equally bland son, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse as
a dull redux of McLovin. Still, in the first half of the film, these
characters only slightly distract from the bold comedy surrounding the
protagonists. Unfortunately, as Jackson Browne once sang, &#x22;all god
things must come to an end.&#x22;<br /><br />The good things in &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; come to an end when the story begins to
embrace the formula it&#x27;s supposed to be tearing apart. Director Matthew
Vaughn abandons humor almost entirely as the film claws its way to a
gun-crazy climax. There&#x27;s nothing funny about a scene in which
gangsters kidnap and plan to televise the execution of good, if
misguided, characters. Vaughn seems eager to comment on his audience&#x27;s
potentially disturbing fascination with violence. This is clear in the
film&#x27;s first half when Kick-Ass enters a fight with high hopes, only to
suffer real consequences. It&#x27;s similarly clear early in the film, when
Hit-Girl dispatches some baddies in gruesome and methodical fashion.
Towards the end of the film, however, Vaughn seems to fall into the
very trap on which he sought to comment. <br /><br />The encounters toward the end of the film drip with violence, but it&#x27;s
all very stylized. In order to grip the audience, Vaughn employs a type
of violence that allows viewers o revel and cheer. This type of
violence dominates most genre superhero films (just look t &#x22;Iron Man&#x27;s&#x22;
robotic smack-down, or at &#x22;The Incredible Hulk&#x27;s&#x22; creature clash), so I
would never expect it from a supposed &#x22;satire&#x22; of those films. Generic
plot convention after generic plot convention, standard fight scene
after standard fight scene, and ridiculous dialogue piece after
ridiculous dialogue piece made the second half of Kick-Ass a huge
disappointment That said, most of the action is well-shot, the pace
still moved along well, and the film&#x27;s ending has a certain charm to
it. <br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; was not the film that it could have been. It starts off
satirizing genre superhero movies, but it ends up becoming one. Still,
the film works well on the whole. It has an exciting visual style, a
number of cackle-worthy comedic bits, and some great hammy
performances. It doesn&#x27;t totally kick ass, but it just might kick butt.
