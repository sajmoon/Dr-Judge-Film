Kick-Ass attempts to cynically deconstruct the superhero genre, and at
that level it doesn&#x27;t quite make it for me. Watchmen - clearly the
graphic novel, but the movie too - did so much more intelligently. The
sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek attitude with which the gruesome violence is
shown fails to make it any less gruesome, and is all too easily taken
at face value, especially by younger viewers, thus missing completely
the point Vaughn was trying to make.<br /><br />On the entertainment and style fronts, Kick-Ass is more successful, and
it manages to create a truly fresh cinematic superhero look, a more
colorful contrast to The Dark Knight&#x27;s gritty realism. The acting for
the most part is mediocre at best, except for the wonderful Chloe
Moretz as Hit Girl and Nicolas Cage - who hasn&#x27;t been this good in a
long time - as bad-ass vigilante Big Daddy. It doesn&#x27;t really matter
though, because Kick-Ass is all about style and action scenes; the
dialog-based scenes are weak and dull enough as they are, filling up
the gaps in-between coolness. For comics and superhero fans, including
ex-fans who long ago dropped their interest in the costumed vigilantes,
this is a great piece of entertainment, but not a whole lot more.
