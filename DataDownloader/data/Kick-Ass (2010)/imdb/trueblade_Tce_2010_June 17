2010_June 17 
Lot of negative reviews here, but most of them seethe that an 11 year
old girl shouldn&#x27;t be swearing (Remember when we were 11? Oh, we sure
as hell swore, when we got away from our parents, didn&#x27;t we?) Excellent
mixture of action, drama, and a little teen drama.<br /><br />All in all, one of my favorite movies of 2010. Met a lot of people who
hate this movie....but if you&#x27;re a fan of unique films like
Zombieland....you&#x27;re going to love this one.<br /><br />If French love stories, with a lot of cuddling and emotion is more your
thing......you probably won&#x27;t like Kick Ass.<br /><br />It&#x27;s simply a bad ass movie, that redefines the super hero Genre. Chloe
Moretz is amazing, Nick Cage does a very good job, and while it&#x27;s a bit
clich&#xE9; and trite...it&#x27;s clich&#xE9; and trite in a way nobody has dared to
do before.<br /><br />It really raises the bar. It really sets a new standard....and I&#x27;ve
watched this movie over and over. It&#x27;s simply....really damn good.
