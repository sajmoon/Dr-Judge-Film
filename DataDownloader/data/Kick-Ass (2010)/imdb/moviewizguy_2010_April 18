&#x22;How come nobody&#x27;s ever tried to be a superhero?&#x22; When Dave Lizewski
dons a wetsuit to become the no-nonsense vigilante, Kick-Ass, he soon
finds an answer to his own question: because it hurts. But, overcoming
all the odds, Dave quickly becomes a phenomenon, capturing the
imagination of the public. However, he&#x27;s not the only superhero out
there &#x96; the father-daughter crime-fighting duo, Big Daddy and Hit Girl,
have been taking down the criminal empire of local Mafioso, Frank
D&#x27;Amico. And, as Kick-Ass gets drawn into their world of bullets and
bloodletting with Frank&#x27;s son, Chris, the stage is set for a final
showdown between the forces of good and evil - in which the DIY hero
will have to live up to his name. Or die trying...<br /><br />KICK-ASS is one of those movies that is difficult to market to the
mainstream audience, especially since the opening weekend for this film
was disappointing. It has a lot of bloody violence along with a little
girl who makes people think that this is a kiddie flick and the fact
that this film is rated R just brings a whole lot of mess and confusion
to the table of what this film really is. The best way I can describe
what this film is is SPIDER MAN mixed with ZOMBIELAND without the
zombies.<br /><br />Unlike the title of the film might suggest, Kick-Ass does end up being
overshadowed by the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. In fact, I&#x27;ll
even go as far to say that Hit Girl herself made the movie what it is.
She&#x27;s such a fantastic, awesome, wild, brilliant, colorful, bad-ass
character that I liked her more than Kick-Ass. Chloe Moretz plays the
said character so well, that she lightens up the screen every time she
comes on. You thought the profanity-mouthed kid in ROLE MODELS was
shocking? You haven&#x27;t seen anything yet.<br /><br />However, saying that, Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass did a great job as
well. I can relate to the nerd-type character he plays. Nicolas Cage is
a mixed-bag. In some scenes, he&#x27;s brilliant, while in others, he&#x27;s
rather weird. Mark Strong as the villain is more of the same from
SHERLOCK HOLMES a couple of months back. Still, he has some great
scenes with comic timing. Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn&#x27;t have much
screen time as the trailers suggested, but he&#x27;s good for the amount of
time he appears in the film.<br /><br />It&#x27;s apparent the main goal of the film is to entertain its audience
and it succeeds at that. The film is filled with bloody violence,
vulgar language, and big laughs, most coming from my favorite character
Hit Girl. Because of this, however, the many themes touched upon in
this film is never fully explored, which could have made the movie a so
much better. There are some really moving scenes as well, along with
suspense in the fantastically shot action scenes.<br /><br />The main flaw of the film comes from the tone. It found a hard time
whether to be a straight-up comedy or a dramedy because somewhere in
this film, it does get serious and dark, unlike the marketing might
have suggested. In some parts of the film, I didn&#x27;t know when to laugh
or not. Because of this, I didn&#x27;t enjoy the film as much as I would
have enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, with these flaws aside, director Matthew Vaughn successfully
delivers to the audience an action-packed popcorn flick with great
characters. I found the movie to be ludicrously entertaining from
beginning to end with a lot of big laughs and some bad ass action
scenes. This is the very definition of an awesome movie. I know I&#x27;m not
the first person to say this but KICK-ASS kicks ass (for the most
part).
