To paraphrase Zoolander: &#x22;Superheroes - they&#x27;re so hot right now&#x22;. And
perhaps it is its chasing such a tide of success that makes Matthew
Vaughn&#x27;s Kick-Ass - part introspective examination of the &#x27;real world&#x27;
angle of superheroism and part joyful addition to the genre crammed
with enough violence and questionable content to gleefully rattle the
bars of political correctness - vaguely less remarkable than had it
been released five to ten years prior. This is not to say that the
quality of an otherwise outstanding movie is lowered simply due to the
year of its release date (to fail to appreciate the comedic marvel that
is Vaughn&#x27;s film would be a spoiled audience indeed) but rather that
the popularity of the genre which procured a mass release for such edgy
material also somewhat does it a disservice in the sense of setting a
standard one inevitably hopes the film will supersede, perhaps
unrealistically. <br /><br />As such, those anticipating Kick-Ass providing thematic ruminations on
the pros and cons of comic book culture and the repercussions of
heroism in a &#x27;real&#x27;, internet age to exceed (or even equal) those of
other such reflexive texts such as Watchmen may be disappointed. While
the film introduces many such queries, they are often left
under-explored, leaving the film feeling somewhat thematically weak as
well as not quite managing to &#x27;say&#x27; anything exceptionally innovative
in reference to its genre. <br /><br />But let&#x27;s be honest - one would be hard pressed finding the average
audience member to lamenting the lack of truly in-depth genre
existentialism to the point of ignoring kinetic fight scenes, and such
notions as theme, while interesting, feel largely incidental in favour
of the film&#x27;s sense of high-octane fun. Kick-Ass is a film which truly
delivers what it promises, from carrying over the glorious carnage and
hilarity of its preview material to living up to its title.
Nonetheless, as riotously enjoyable as the film is, such a quality does
again provide a niggling complaint - the film is awesome, granted, but
always just as awesome as one would expect, rather than truly taking
audiences off guard or pushing the envelope well past the point of
hype. You do get what you pay for, for better or for worse.<br /><br />Thankfully, what you pay for is almost resoundingly for better. Despite
a slow start in which the film riffs a touch too obviously on
established superhero films (particularly Sam Raimi&#x27;s Spider-Man),
toeing the line of &#x27;Epic Movie&#x27; style winks at times, Vaughn quickly
finds his momentum and subsequently ramps up the pace, mayhem and fun
to satisfying overdrive. With a fascinating colour aesthetic
(contrasting the murky greys and browns of the city with the Crayola
Technicolour of the heroes) and delightfully whimsical and effective
musical score (often setting brutal violence or slapstick humour to
classical music, achieving an innovative stylistic deadpan) and a
snappy script keeping the tone lively, Vaughn&#x27;s film demonstrates
plenty to love and appreciate. <br /><br />But then come the fight scenes. Whirling cascades of intricate
choreography, gritty brutality (particularly Kick-Ass&#x27; first attempts
at combating crime) and blazing gunfire (particularly jarring for a
superhero film) intertwining to become some of the most simultaneously
cathartic, uncomfortable yet gleefully fun violent interludes in recent
cinema, managing to both mock and relish the sadistic fun of movie
violence, and ramping up to one of the most ludicrously enjoyable final
payoff showdowns in ages. Kick- Ass could almost function as an
exploration of the role and purpose of cinematic violence as much as
comic book culture, but whether treated as probing or entertaining,
Vaughn&#x27;s hard- hitting tone is exceedingly difficult to shake or to not
enjoy.<br /><br />Particular quality is extracted from the film&#x27;s magnificent cast, as
charismatic rising star Aaron Johnson effortlessly delivers overblown
goofiness while remaining intensely likable as the titular Kick-Ass,
warmly centring the film whether as exasperated nerd or wide-eyed
superhero. Christopher Mintz-Plasse adds a welcome wounded resentment
to his customary gawky cockiness as spoiled rich kid superhero Red
Mist, and the reliable Mark Strong offers another creation of credibly
stern villainy. However, the film&#x27;s real triumph lies in its unlikely
background heroes. Nicholas Cage shreds expectations with sublimely
hilarious work as Batman-ripoff heroic patriarch &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;, his
performance pitched perfectly between manic hysteria and hokey charm
(and a voice deliciously pantomiming Adam West&#x27;s unforgettable
fragmented Batman dialect). Equally, Chloe Grace Moretz is a comedic
revelation, stealing the show as hard-as-nails vigilante Hit-Girl, and
never failing to astound with exactly how far her role will push the
boundaries of political correctness. Vaughn also collects a bevy of
background players who deliver compelling characterisations for a
change, the only exception being Lyndsy Fonseca as Kick-Ass&#x27; romantic
interest, who, despite a charming performance, feels like an ultimately
mishandled and incidental character, decentring the film&#x27;s emotional
arc somewhat. <br /><br />Wild, wacky and daring, Kick-Ass triumphs through managing to dredge up
genuine heart, exhilaration and sentiment in the midst of occasional
contrivance or excessive convention. A definitive comment on or twist
of the superhero genre? Not quite. An enormous array of pulsating,
tremendous fun (ultimately the point of the picture)? A vehement and
blood- spattered &#x22;HELL YES&#x22;! <br /><br />-8.5/10
