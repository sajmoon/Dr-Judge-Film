Before i saw this movie, i had heard that it was simply a gory teenage
action flick. Usually I&#x27;m cool with that so i decided that it would be
fun. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t like the loser turned awesome story? As iwatched
this film it reminded me of one person: Quentin Tarantino. The score
was perfect given the circumstances in a twisted way, the gore and
action was over stylized as if it was to look unreal, the story was
offbeat and fun and definitely clever. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the works
of Tarantino, and watching this movie made me realize what it would be
like if i watched a superhero movie done by him.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was very solid. Nicholas Cage temporarily got
out of his &#x22;dud after dud&#x22; funk with a solid performance, Mclovin did
his dorky thing, and Aaron Johnson shows a very promising future with
his role. The real star of this film, however, is Chloe Grace Mortez.
Although her performance was dubbed &#x22;inappropriate&#x22;, i can&#x27;t help but
think Hollywood needs to lighten up and realize a fantastic performance
when it is given! <br /><br />To sum this film up, i can only say one thing that will apply to
everyone, whether you take it positively or negatively: You will never
look at a Superhero movie the same ever again.
