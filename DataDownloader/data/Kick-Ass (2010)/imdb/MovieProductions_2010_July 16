*** out of (****)<br /><br />&#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is the Matthew Vaughn directed action packed extravaganza
that&#x27;s based off the comic book series and spun a lot of controversy. A
majority of the top critics thought it was truly repugnant to see an
eleven year old spew out f bombs, kick ass, and take names. And yes,
most strict Christians have complained about the film due to its
graphic nature and vile profanity. Even without the strong controversy,
I know this sounds heavily clich&#xE9;d, but Kick Ass, kicks, well... ass.
It sure kicked mine. How can you not love a film that has strong
performances, a great story, and just awe-inspiring cinematography? To
regard Kick Ass as another comic book film is like calling Alone in the
Dark a cinematic masterpiece. I can&#x27;t believe how utterly satisfied I
was with this movie. This is probably one of the most electrifying and
great film experiences I&#x27;ve had. Is this film Citizen Kane? No, but
it&#x27;s such a great film on its own merits, that it doesn&#x27;t even matter. <br /><br />Kick Ass revolves around Dave (Johnson), who wonders what it would be
like to be a superhero. So Dave decides to buy a heroic costume, scares
off a group of street punks in the beginning of the film, and entitles
himself &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;. Along the way, &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; meets up with &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22;
and &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22; who befriend him. However, the juvenile &#x22;Red Mist&#x22; is
trying to take him down. <br /><br />First off, the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The movie is
so vibrant and rich with color, that it&#x27;s like looking at an ancient
art painting. The movie has so much texture and detail that it&#x27;s almost
like it jumps off the screen. Furthermore, the action is truly superb
and is nothing short of awesome. Seriously folks, this is the best and
most plausible action since &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;. And yes, I went that far.
Moreover, this movie has been talked about because of its graphic
nature and doesn&#x27;t disappoint in terms of gore. We get a human
microwave explosion, a decapitated leg, a shot to the face, and several
balls-to-the-wall action sequences. Additionally, the performances in
this movie are simply terrific. Every character truly stands out, even
the most insignificant of characters. Furthermore, the script is
extremely fresh. The jokes pack a punch, the premise is fun, the
subplots are great, and the movie&#x27;s more drastic moments are simply
tear-jerkers. Also, the pacing is fantastic. Scenes are paced pretty
briskly and you will not be bored.<br /><br />While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws, but they
are extremely minimal, and minor. First off, I thought before Hit Girl
was introduced, the film wasn&#x27;t that great. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if Hit
Girl wasn&#x27;t in this movie, I&#x27;d give the movie a 5. It still was good,
but things got a lot better when she kicked into gear. To add to that,
I thought this movie could have been more fun. There were a little too
many depressing moments, that would have made an otherwise non-stop fun
escapist summer fare movie.<br /><br />Overall, Kick Ass is one of the most fun films of the year. It simply
is inclusive to the elements of a great movie: terrific acting, story,
direction, gore, action, cinematography, and script. Its flaws are so
minor and minimal, that they are so easy to overlook. Not to mention,
it&#x27;s just a whole lot of fun. Really, I don&#x27;t think this movie could
have been any better. It shows that Matthew Vaughn doesn&#x27;t want to make
a good movie. He wants to make a great movie and he succeeded. If only
directors would be this passionate and ambitious about their movies,
then we&#x27;d get more films like &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;. &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is one of those
rare movies that&#x27;s fun and well-crafted. Seek out a matin&#xE9;e.
