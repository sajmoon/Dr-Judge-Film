That was some KICKASS movie. I had had enough of crap superhero movies
before, and if you are like me you would expect &#x27;kickass&#x27; to be one of
those. But this one was like no other. The story is basically not much
different from ordinary superhero stories. But its portrayed in a
fairly realistic sense. Kickass, hit girl, Big daddy suddenly seem so
possible unlike spiderman, superman or anyone of those heroes with
SUPERPOWERS. Background score was great. The music blended perfectly
with the movie.I especially liked the Prodigy&#x27;s score where they
introduce Aaron Johnson. Characters are also so comic-like. Aaron
johnson was great playing kickass But my favorite character from the
movie was hit girl. Especially her last action sequence. This movie
could so be a real story.
