Kick-Ass (2010) Aaron Johnson/ Christopher Mintz-Plasse/ Mark Strong/
Chloe Moretz<br /><br />Kick-Ass kicks butt!<br /><br />Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t expect much from this movie, maybe it was
great company I was in, or maybe, just maybe this movie is really f-ing
good. I think all three are true. I hate to build something up just to
disappoint but, &#x22;WOW, I didn&#x27;t see that coming.&#x22;<br /><br />Cast is what it is. They all play their roles well. Mark Strong I
believe as his character, Scarface with a weakened backbone. Do I have
to mention Nicolas Cage, do I&#x85;skipping it. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t have
a clue who Chloe Moretz was, but she steals the movie, big time. <br /><br />The movie has a teen comedy side that makes it okay for the main steam
people to enjoy it. But the flip side to that is uber dark. The fight
scenes are &#x22;Equilibrium* meets Tarantino&#x22; to a point. The soundtrack is
random but fun. I can&#x27;t get enough of the sets. (Who picked the art for
the penthouse? Lol, no, really&#x85;bad, but funny.)<br /><br />I give it a 10 out 10. Go see it. Take me with you, it&#x27;s fun, dark, and
fast. Like I like my coffee.<br /><br />*Just because I reference it, doesn&#x27;t mean I like it. :-p
