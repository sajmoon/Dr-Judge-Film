Greetings again from the darkness. Just when you are convinced the
comic book movie thing has been overdone, in swoops director Matthew
Vaughn (the excellent &#x22;Layer Cake&#x22;) to reach an entirely new level
through a unique, unconventional and twisted approach. It does&#x27;t take
but a few minutes to realize that clich&#xE9;s mixed with shocks will mess
with your movie-processing mind! <br /><br />Somehow we are treated to teen angst,superhero-ism and most every human
emotion and type between the two. WARNING: this movie is rated R and it
is a strong R ... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS! The film slam-dances between
ultra violence and uber-geekdom and satire driven slapstick. We get a
12 year old Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl, wielding weapons even more deadly
than her shockingly adult tongue. Moretz was also a standout in last
year&#x27;s &#x22;500 Days of Summer&#x22;. We get her revenge-driven ex-clean cop Big
Daddy father (Nicolas Cage) in Batman costume mentoring her to the ways
of a world class assassin. I busted out laughing when I realized that
Mr. Cage&#x27;s voice mannerism mimic that of the great Adam West while
donning the black cape. A very nice touch. Our other home grown, would
be superheros are Aaron Johnson as Kick-ass (replete with green scuba
suit) and McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as Red Mist. Most of these
characters are one step removed from &#x22;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&#x22;.<br /><br />Of course a comic book story must have a top notch villain and these
days there are few better than Mark Strong. He delivers another
terrific dead-pan performance as a drug lord and father to Red Mist.
Strong&#x27;s character is the driving force behind Big Daddy&#x27;s quest for
revenge.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson&#x27;s Kick-ass is an example of the clunky teenager who has a
good heart and is desperate for attention from the girls. He even
accepts being labeled as gay by the hot chick he adores just so he can
spend time with her. He hangs at the comic book store with his equally
geeky friends and then &#x22;transforms&#x22; into Kick-ass, a superhero with no
powers other than a desire to do what&#x27;s right and help those in need.<br /><br />Mark Millar&#x27;s script balances many cultural and societal observations
while delivering a visual parade of images and sounds (wondeful music
and score ... including ELVIS) and moments that will keep the viewer
unsettled. You might think it odd that an early scene lingers on a
giant advertisement featuring Claudia Schiffer. Ms. Schiffer is married
to the director and becomes one of many tributes and satires throughout
the film. It is quite a different experience and one that not all will
enjoy ... but it is to be admired for reaching for new levels.
