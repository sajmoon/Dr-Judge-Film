Whoever said you needed superpowers or high-tech gadgets to be a
superhero? In KICK-ASS, Dave Lizewski proves just that as the titular
hero, fighting with nothing but lean, mean determination and desire to
uphold justice.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson does a great job as the hero geek, morphing from a shy
pushover into a full-fledged crime-fighter in a green suit who would
die in a split second to protect his tiny little philosophy and
mission. Nicolas Cage pays homage to the 60s Batman and revels in his
role as the vengeance seeking ex-cop. But the show stealer here comes
no bigger than the size of 12-year-old Chlo&#xEB; Moretz, dispelling all
those images of adolescent girls those tween queens on magazine covers
have given you. As Hit Girl, she disposes her enemies faster than
Superman could finish his heroic opening statement, and does so with
unceremonious aggression and minimum fuss. The fact that she&#x27;s so young
differs from those femme fatales in that she does not rely on any sort
of sexual appeal to make her character more attractive or intriguing;
she doesn&#x27;t have one, she didn&#x27;t need one. She&#x27;s awesome fully because
she took down seven guys and left one pissing in his pants, putting the
Batgirls and Elektras to shame.<br /><br />Perhaps most worth applauding is the no holds barred direction of the
visual style and action of this movie. Too often, films have been toned
down and made bland to avoid the R-rating and often causes creative
integrity to suffer. From start to end, however, Kick-Ass showed
absolutely no concern for going &#x22;overboard&#x22;. There&#x27;s no holding back
from the excessive cursing, blood and gore of the movie that you could
be forgiven if you thought Tarantino was behind this. <br /><br />All in all, KICK-ASS is a refreshing take on the now badly exploited
superhero genre, and is capable of taking itself seriously at times yet
provide mindless entertainment with witty humor and high-octane action
that promises to keep you at the edge of your seat. A terrific way to
start the summer of 2010.
