Kick-Ass is a low budget horror film from the UK. The Director Matthew
Vaughn has made two great movies in the before. Layer Cake and Stardust
are example of amazing super flop cinema for British chick flicks.
Kick-Ass is a direct copy of the Hindi blockbuster Dariya Dil. It has
elements and death scenes from both sequels of the Dariya Dil
franchise. Captain Kick-Ass himself is a cheap version on Gulu Gogi.
The star cast are all unknown B Grade actors. Only one actor that I
love in this film Nicolas Cage. This is a complete poor show all the
way and will not appeal to anybody. Bad acting and bad directing and
the audience are getting bored of cheap xerox copies. <br /><br />Well what can i say apart from the fact that this is a non stop
entertainment movie for little kids. Nicolas Cage is fantastic in many
movies and is possibly his biggest disaster. The ending of the movie
was a copy of another Bollywood Film Kranti Kshetra (1994) Mithun
starrer. Which is also a copy of Low grade (But Fantastic) Movie Toy
Soldiers. Word of advise:if you have small kids, or teens/pre-teens
that are NOT gays, keep them away from this feature. <br /><br />Good effort, but I&#x27;m a Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan freak, so i did not
enjoy this.
