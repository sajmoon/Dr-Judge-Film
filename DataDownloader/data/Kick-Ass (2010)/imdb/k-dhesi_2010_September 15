Kick ass simply kicked ass! Its far more than just a superhero
spoof....Its a hysterical comedy/action. It reaches out to all those
teens or maybe even adults that have always dreamt of actually being a
superhero! One thing thats certain, it will keep you laughing without a
doubt and another thing i was actually surprised by some of the action,
real cool and slick at times.If not the best comedy/action ever made,
its a shoe in for 2nd place! <br /><br />Going to see the film i had no major expectations, in fact i thought of
it as another &#x27;high budget&#x27; comedy film (which seem to be noway near as
funny as the &#x27;low budget&#x27; comedies) but i was actually surprised, the
result was AWESOME! Definitely worth 2 hours of my life and a couple of
moneys from my wallet! Matthew Vaughn has suddenly blasted through the
Hollywood barriers, Congrats to him on such a great summer flick!<br /><br />If your wondering what this film has to offer, let me give you a little
taste; Silly unpopular &#x27;invisible&#x27; nerds trying to become superheroes,
a outrages cast, cool and funny action scenes, a hysterical script and
a movie that for once exceeds most peoples expectation! Did i miss
anything?<br /><br />All in all this movie is a cross-over of superbad and superhero movie
and is far better then both of them put together! Its a feel good movie
and it deserves the hype that it received. Ill recommend for anyone who
has a thing called sense of humour. A great feel good summer flick for
teens and grown ups. Once again it has to be said. Kick ass kicked ass!
Go see it!
