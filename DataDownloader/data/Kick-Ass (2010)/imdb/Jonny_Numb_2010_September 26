2010_September 26 
Not too long ago, in a galaxy that now seems incredibly far away,
Lionsgate unleashed some of the grimiest, most unabashedly un-PC films
into mainstream theatres (&#x22;Saw&#x22;, &#x22;High Tension,&#x22; and &#x22;The Devil&#x27;s
Rejects&#x22; immediately come to mind); as a result, the studio gained a
favorable reputation among genre loyalists looking for cheap thrills
delivered by up-and-coming talent. It would seem that &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; (whose
ostentatious title is culled from a comic-book series I have not read),
the tale of a dorky high-schooler with aspirations of superhero
grandeur, would fit well into the &#x22;cheap thrills&#x22; department...but
instead becomes an astonishingly unfunny punchline unto itself.
Ignoring the fact that the film is a tonally inconsistent mess (dark,
&#x27;outrageous&#x27; humor -- a little girl who blows away henchmen twice her
size! -- is mashed between sloppily-choreographed action scenes and
agonizingly pretentious teen-talk), it flat-out fails in its central
conceit: that even a dorky high-schooler who dons an obnoxious green
wetsuit can be elevated to Living Legend status (with the reliable help
of faux-hype instigators like MySpace!). Truth be told, Kick-Ass does
little of note for the duration of this miserable slog, and the
inclusion of other not-so-super heroes (including a lame Batman
caricature essayed by an insufferably lame Nicolas Cage) only further
muddies what little focus this film has. It also doesn&#x27;t help that the
main villain is standard-issue cipher, a dime-a-dozen mob boss we&#x27;ve
seen too many times before. Did I mention that this whole ordeal crawls
toward the close-to-two hour mark? Perhaps I&#x27;m just missing the point
of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;...unless its point is riddled with the kind of whip-smart
irony that led me to the following conclusion: with the right kind of
moxie, obnoxiousness, and low-rent business savvy, those among us who
are most unworthy of attention (but possess a loud enough mouth to
voice their vapid opinions with confidence) can launch themselves into
a grotesque parody of celebrity without really DOING anything. With
&#x22;Kick-Ass,&#x22; the exponentially lowered expectations for super-heroes
translates into a new icon for the Facebook Generation. Pathetic.
