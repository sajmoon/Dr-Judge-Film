This movie, had is a hell of a ride from start to finish, the
script,acting and action scenes are the best this year. One of the best
superhero movies around to date. There&#x27;s something special about a 12
year old girl kicking ass and using the C word lol. 10 out 10. A must
see.<br /><br />The film was written by jane goldman, johnathan Ross&#x27;s wife. A very
special script, hilarious film start to finish. The movie has a comedy,
but dark feel to it with great colour to give it the superhero feel, i
would recommend this film to any movie buff genre fan.<br /><br />Watch out for the awesome knife scenes with hitgirl a must replay great
stunts, from a 12 year girl. 10/10
