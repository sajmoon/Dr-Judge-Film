I will avoid giving too much away. Here is my short summary: Imagine
Tarantino directed a cross between Sin City and Power Puff Girls movie.
Now add lots of gory violence with plenty of money shots. Do Not take
your kids it has lots of violence and some bad language and sex, well
deserving of R rating.<br /><br />Thank goodness the trailers have not given too much away with this
movie. You think it is going to be some movie about one dorky teen who
is a Spiderman wannabe&#x85;NOT! The movie has multiple stories working at
the same time.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn hit this movie out of the park. This is only his 2nd
major budget directing job, and his 3rd writing job. Ohh and he also
Produced this movie so he should be reaping some major bank for this.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson was OK in this movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was his
dorky self. Nicolas Cage did great in a medium size role. But it was 13
year old Chole Moretz who stole this movie, stabbed it then set it on
fire! <br /><br />The movie is full of clever lines, comic fanfare and even pokes fun of
superhero movies. This gets my highest rating: Run to see this movie
then buy the DVD for watching at home.
