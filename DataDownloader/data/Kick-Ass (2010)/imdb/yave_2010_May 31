Just before the start of the movie, some young idiots tried to make me
change my seat because they were a band, but I stand up and they had to
split! In fact, this helps to understand what the movie is about: not
really superheroes because in the real world, they don&#x27;t exist but
about courage because all of us can show it we wanted. That&#x27;s why
courage was perceived by my favorite writer (PKD) as the finest quality
because without it, all the others qualities are useless. If you let
bad things happens and do nothing, you are as guilty as the actual
wrong doer. This movie is great telling this lesson because you see
that there are only a few people awake and aware of their duties while
all the others are passive. <br /><br />This movie is also a funny and accurate testimony about teens in the
third millennium: Girls, wanking, comics-books are still present but
now Internet, cellulars, social groups are part of the life and change
it forever. Every moment in life becomes faster and as Bill Gates said,
the world is right at the tip of your finger. <br /><br />As a comic fan, I particularly liked the sketches of JRJR (John Romita
JR, the actual artist of the comic) that can be seen at the Big Daddy
Hideout and in the comic montage even if his story was difficult to
understand. I can&#x27;t judge if this is a faithful adaptation or not
because I don&#x27;t have read the original comics yet. <br /><br />I can only say that it was great up to the online beating. The
stroboscopic light was great and I think it would have been a terrific
grand finale. But, the movie adds another reel after this and it was
not &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; anymore but a Bond movie with a lot of gadgets. <br /><br />But, I had fun overall and this new and cool cast worths paying
attention!
