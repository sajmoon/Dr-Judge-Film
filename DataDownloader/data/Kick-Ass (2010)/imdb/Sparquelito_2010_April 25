Excellent movie. My wife and I needed some good escapist fun yesterday,
and we escaped the rain and thunderstorms for the comfort of the movie
theater. The buttered popcorn was good, this film was GREAT!! The
characters were well written and well acted, the script was human and
very engaging, and the action was non-stop. The young actress who
played Hit Girl made the movie for me, she was incredible. I laughed
and cheered throughout the film. Please go see it, but please do not
bring your little kids. It is fun and hilarious, but it is also
brutally violent. Some of the parents in the theater had actually
brought their small children to see the movie, and I thought that was a
bad move. Anyway, this is one really clever and entertaining blood-bath
of a movie for grown ups and older teens. Two thumbs way up.
