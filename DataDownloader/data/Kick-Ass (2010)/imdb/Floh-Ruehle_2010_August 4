2010_August 4 
I actually went into the theater with high hopes. I saw the trailer and
really liked the idea and most of the gags I saw in there. Also, I can
usually rely on the IMDb-ratings, as they resemble my taste in movies.
I was highly disappointed this time.<br /><br />The good things first: The movie has its moments. Some jokes are really
funny and the overall idea still stands on solid ground. The acting by
Aaron Johnson and Nicolas Cage is really solid and carries the plot,
Mark Strong pleases as the really bad guy that he already pulled off in
&#x22;Sherlock Holmes&#x22; and &#x22;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Rolla&#x22;. The directing is far from
brilliant, but it is solid and doesn&#x27;t annoy.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that it can not decide what kind of flick
it wants to be. It quickly alternates between &#x22;American Pie&#x22;-like
teenage humor gags, serious character builds (thanks to Nic Cage) and
really, really mindless killing sprees. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have seen
and enjoyed movies with tons of graphic violence (e.g. &#x22;Shoot &#x27;em up&#x22;),
but they differed in two ways: First they were consistent in their
presentation. It is really not funny, borderline disturbing, to see a
movie change from children&#x27;s buddy movie to a little girl slaughtering
people, accompanied by aggressive music. And secondly, the killings are
far from being taken seriously here. I guess, death is supposed to be
funny and that made me forget most of the giggles I squeezed out during
other scenes.<br /><br />Over all: &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; would have gotten a solid 7/10 in my book if it
sticked to the feeling of the trailer. It would not have been a great
movie, but good entertainment if they had eased down on the violence a
little. (Yes, I sometimes like violence in movies, it just seemed
inadequately placed here) The way it was presented in the cinema, I can
not give it more than 5/10 stars. The funny parts were ruined by the
cruel action sequences, the action sequences were ruined by the strange
split between not taking it seriously but still accompanying it with
The Prodigy, and the serious parts alone were very rare and not able to
save the whole movie.<br /><br />Sorry, but I can not understand how this can be so overrated. Except if
mostly kids saw it and found it cool to get some graphic violence in
the cinema for once.
