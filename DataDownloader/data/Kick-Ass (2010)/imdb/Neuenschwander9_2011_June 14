Shame on you, Vaughn! I was a big fan of Kick-Ass comics. You made some
incredibly characters into right out wusses.<br /><br />2010 was Matt Vaughn&#x27;s comeback from politics to films. Kick-Ass was
over-hyped and even released 1 day before schedule. The film is typical
and too filmy 80&#x27;s. The story is flimsy. The start is good but the
Nowhere Boy&#x27;s superhero act gets to the nerves and the entire Kick-Ass
track too filmy and overdone. It&#x27;s like a compilation of Aaron Johnson
angry young men roles but looks too much.<br /><br />Even many scenes are stupid.<br /><br />The climax is so stupid and an insult to the court. Aaron Johnson&#x27;s
handling is nothing great. Music is okay. Elizabeth McGovern looks
overweight and hams badly and her Kick-Ass act is okay. Aaron Johnson
irritates Nicolas Cage is as usual. If Bollywood cinema is to be
believed, corruption must be a significant problem, and there is a
clear wish for a &#x27;strong hero&#x27; that will fight on the side of the poor
and the innocent.
