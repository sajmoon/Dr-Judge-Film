When I saw the previews for this film I was unimpressed and was
absolutely going to skip it. However, after seeing some of the high
reviews it got here at IMDb and elsewhere I thought I would give it a
try and rent it. I am disappointed I spent a dollar to rent this film.
It is by far one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. If there was a
movie responsible for the dumbing down of American culture this would
be it.<br /><br />First of all this movie is rated R yet panders to teenagers and young
adults. It is appropriate for neither. The content and subject matter
are immature even for the comic book culture. This movie is poor all
the way around. Horrible acting, awful screenplay, dumb montages, and
poor theme. I would recommend this film to no one. There are much more
things worthy of your time. Read some real literature. Watch an actual
film. This garbage of a movie will only make you dumber.<br /><br />I am doubly upset by the fact that it gets such a high rating here and
in my local newspaper the San Francisco Chronicle. In fact, I have been
using IMDb for years now but only registered recently in order to bring
this false rating down. This is NOT a good movie and should be rated
accordingly. Wake up people! The fact that it has received the ratings
it has is disturbing to say the least. Our culture is in danger when a
film like this gets good reviews. It becomes all too clear when a movie
like this gets approved for a sequel what America and our society is
all about, greed and money over morals, decency, and ethics. People who
like this movie have attention spans that can only be measured in
nanoseconds or are not old enough to have seen this R rated film. I
hold movies like this responsible for the dumbing down of America. The
fact that it has such a high rating is a bad sign indeed.
