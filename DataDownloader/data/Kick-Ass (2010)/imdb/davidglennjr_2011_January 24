So there&#x27;s two things i have to say.<br /><br />One, if you&#x27;re watching this to see a super hero movie, and you&#x27;re a
big fan of action with tons of explosions you&#x27;re not going to get that.
It has plenty of action, but it&#x27;s more fight scenes than explosions and
such.<br /><br />Two, although i didn&#x27;t originally see this movie in theaters because i
thought it looked like more of a kids movie, i was wrong. This movie
isn&#x27;t for young children, lot&#x27;s of blood, violence, references to sex.
My personal opinion is kids under 12 shouldn&#x27;t watch this. But that&#x27;s
obviously ultimately the parents decision.<br /><br />The movie was great, no problems with the directing. The pace of the
movie keeps you drawn in, never any dull and boring moments like in
movies such as 300, Avatar etc. This is easily in my top ten list of
movies. I know it won&#x27;t be firs, because that&#x27;s taken by The Dark
Knight, but i&#x27;ll probably end up placing it in top five.<br /><br />Great movie. If you haven&#x27;t seen it for any reason, try to watch it.
It&#x27;s a masterpiece.
