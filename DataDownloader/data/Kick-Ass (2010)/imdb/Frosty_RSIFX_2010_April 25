I hardly ever post a full review on this site. But this movie is
getting WAY too many good reviews.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m in my early twenties and I don&#x27;t have
children. So I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the profanity, or the violence. It
was the complete pointlessness of the profanity and violence that
bothered me. <br /><br />This movie never knew which way it wanted to go. I don&#x27;t think a film
needs to keep the same tone throughout... but there should be a natural
progression from one theme to the next. This movie tried to be
everything all at once. Eventually I just stopped caring about the
characters and the story altogether... which didn&#x27;t make any
difference, because the movie was so predictable, anyways.<br /><br />The acting was mediocre (and yes, that includes Nic Cage, who played
the only interesting character) and the dialog was just plain dull. The
only gut-laughs came from a few comic/movie references, and some
ridiculous, over top sight gags that don&#x27;t really work.<br /><br />So, despite what the commercials say, you actually DON&#x27;T have to see
this movie. Instead, you should rent A Clockwork Orange or Kill Bill
Volume 2, and see how violence and profanity can be used as a powerful
storytelling device. This movie is just another vehicle for
over-choreographed, slow-motion, super-stylized, &#x22;300&#x22;style
dance-fighting with techno music in the background. There is nothing
original about it.
