Watching Kick-Ass, we realize other films are working at one quarter
speed. We&#x27;ve seen so many superhero movies. Especially after the Dark
Knight watershed, Hollywood&#x27;s as crazed in its search for comic-book
options as Dobbs was in his search for gold in The Treasure of the
Sierra Madre. We feel we&#x27;re familiar with all the angles on the genre,
but then comes this movie, itself a comic book adaptation, about
several superheroes, that, very simply, does it better. It&#x27;s fresh. It
doesn&#x27;t spoof or satirize; it just plays an original tune with all the
same notes. It&#x27;s directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie&#x27;s
hyperkinetic thug films, but directed Layer Cake. So we wonder, who was
learning from who? Kick-Ass tells the basic story of the Ordinary
Teenager, who wonders why nobody&#x27;s ever decided to become a superhero
like the ones in his comics. The reasons are obvious, but when you&#x27;re
one of those invisible kids in high school, your big pipe dreams begin
to be your plot to prove yourself. So he decides to become a real-life
superhero himself, despite having no powers or training in the least.
The movie does not shy away from realistic ramifications of fantastical
encounters, and during his first attempt to fight crime by trying to
stop a carjacking by two local thugs, he&#x27;s indeed beaten, stabbed, and
even hit by a car. He&#x27;s hospitalized, convinces medics to say nothing
of his costume, to say he was brought in naked. But now some of his
nerve endings are damaged, giving him a slightly enhanced capacity to
endure pain, metal plates have been placed in his skeleton to sustain
his bones.<br /><br />The assigned villains of the story are big-city Mafiosi, led by Mark
Strong, returning to the role he unreservedly plays best, the tough,
dominant boss who doesn&#x27;t mind getting his hands dirty. Christopher
Mintz-Plasse is his son, who gets his own drivers, bodyguards, respect.
Mintz-Plasse is the rare character actor iho&#x27;s so naturally funny that
the first time we see him, I started to laugh, even though he&#x27;s not
doing anything really. There&#x27;s just something about his look and
manner; he&#x27;s like Woody Allen for our generation. He becomes Red Mist,
Kick-Ass&#x27;s ridiculous yet cunning costumed nemesis.<br /><br />The charm of this movie is the interweaving of so many rich superhero
characters into a fast-moving but expansive plot with a cheerfully
tasteless sense of cruel humor. I&#x27;m of course speaking mainly of the
father-daughter crime-fighting team of Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. We&#x27;re
introduced to them when he promises to reward her with ice cream after
a training session involving shooting her point-blank while wearing a
bulletproof vest. She masters the martial arts possibly more than any
movie fighter of any age I can recall. She&#x27;s particularly skilled with
lethal knife-throwing, and is rewarded a foot-long knife by Dad
somewhat like a samurai is rewarded a special sword by his sensei. She
fearlessly confronts a hallway filled with gun-sporting gangsters,
shoots, stabs and beats them all to death. The movie&#x27;s not taking the
easy way out: They don&#x27;t wail on the floor; she brutally takes their
lives, apparently experiencing no emotions about it. She uses
heavyweight profanity like a Guy Ritchie thug, and is the toughest,
most effective character in the whole story. This is ballsy, fresh and
reactionary comedy.<br /><br />Outside of the superhero and mob characters, all of whom are richly and
colorfully defined, the movie is nevertheless just as guilty as the
next mainstream movie of not having any clue how to portray high school
kids. I&#x27;m told that in Mark Millar&#x27;s original comic, the girl of
Kick-Ass&#x27;s dreams goes from uninterested to appalled when he reveals
his secret identity. That&#x27;d perfectly befit the film&#x27;s disregard for
the easy way out, which allows it to be so fresh and intriguing. But
Hollywood won&#x27;t have it, as in the most unreasonably stupid scene, he
breaks into her room, explains his deceptions and in a completely
implausible turn they begin having passionate dirty sex. However, where
this would normally sever a movie from my engrossment, this one&#x27;s
working at such a vigorous frequency that I remained interested in its
explosive set pieces and ink-black humor.<br /><br />Perhaps it only seems smarter than it is: There&#x27;s a scene where Vaughn
confidently demonstrates a knowledge of what the audience already
knows, where Strong, and we, see Kick-Ass walking down the street from
behind, he follows him, eagerly attacks him, all of which occurs
without ever giving us exactly what we suspect, but what&#x27;s more
admirable even then is how Vaughn never found it necessary to show the
face of the phony Kick-Ass; he knows we know it&#x27;s not actually him.
However, it&#x27;s never elucidated how they find out later that the
Kick-Ass imposter who they attacked was only an imitator and not the
actual Kick-Ass. If nobody&#x27;s aware of who Kick-Ass really is up to that
point, how do they know the imposter wasn&#x27;t the actual Kick-Ass? Well,
at any rate, it&#x27;s difficult not to have fun at this movie.
