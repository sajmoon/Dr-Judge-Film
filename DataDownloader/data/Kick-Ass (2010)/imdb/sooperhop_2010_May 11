my likes and dislikes: <br /><br />by and large i think most movies of late have not been very good. Taken
and Hurt Locker where the only movies that i have really enjoyed in the
past few years.....i thought avatar&#x27;s plot/script was a total joke and
therefor the movie was a complete waste of time IMO.<br /><br />this movie: <br /><br />with that said, i thought this movie was fun to watch. not at all gory
like some critics said...it&#x27;s comic book style gore guys, calm down and
enjoy it for what it is. as a daddy to a 5 yr old girl i kind of
enjoyed seeing a little girl kick some butt!! however, i wouldn&#x27;t let
any kid of mine under 13 watch this movie. 13-14 with a parent. 15 and
older would be fine to watch it without parent.<br /><br />if your looking for a fun and entertaining movie, watch this one and
use your avatar blue ray disc to warm the fire place.
