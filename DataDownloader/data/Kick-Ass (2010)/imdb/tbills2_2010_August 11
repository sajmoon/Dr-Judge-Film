I have not seen this movie yet. Based off everything I read about it, I
expect to see a pretty good movie. BUT, you gave Kick-Ass a 10 out of
10. A 10 out of 10. Are you mental? So this movie is absolute art. So
this movie is absolute beauty on film. Please. You do realize that on a
scale of 1 to 10, 10 is the highest score you can give, right. That
means that you think movies do not get any better than Kick-Ass.
Kick-Ass is a masterpiece. Kick-Ass is a powerful, soul-churning
experience. Kick-Ass is an epic for the ages. Oh my gosh, I am going to
puke. I seriously do not care how good it is, it is nowhere near a 10
out of 10. Get this trash off the Top250 please. I am seriously
disgusted that I even took time to write about this movie.<br /><br />If I had to pick one movie to put in a time capsule for future
generations, I wouldn&#x27;t pick Forrest Gump, or Titanic, or Schindler&#x27;s
List, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest. Nope, none of these sorry
films are on par with Kick-Ass! A truly gloriously masterfully powerful
epically beautiful film! <br /><br />(ewwgh, excuse me...)
