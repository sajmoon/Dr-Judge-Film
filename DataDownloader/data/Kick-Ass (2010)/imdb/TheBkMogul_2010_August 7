A truly daring comic-book movie, with great action sequences and
dialogue that&#x27;s sure to shock and leave you in awe. It&#x27;s customary to
hear profanities from adults in films, but hearing it from children
always throws you for a loop. Nothing wrong with it in my view, and the
constant use of it by Hit-Girl was a funny story in itself. She and Big
Daddy definitely made for a great team, and provided some of the film&#x27;s
best moments. No doubt she&#x27;s the star of the film, as her scenes are
pretty much brilliant. Not familiar with the comic book, but as a
stand-alone film, it&#x27;s great. So, as far as an adaptation goes, I&#x27;m
pretty sure it lives up to the source material.
