I really liked the concept and the idea of this movie. A random geek
with no significant powers decides to become a superhero. It&#x27;s quite
cagey. There are many flaws, though, with the biggest problem, as far
as i&#x27;m concerned, is the question halfway through the film: do we
concentrate on kick-ass&#x27;es character or Big Daddys (Bruce Waynes
rip-off in many areas, only A LOT worse and not so clever) vengeance.
Regrettably it chooses the second, abandoning the main character in the
background. Another problem was the &#x22;everyone loves Mindy&#x22; aka Hit
Girl. Kinda shocking, and plain awful parenting at the same time. An
eleven-year girl butchering men in style that&#x27;s been taken out of &#x22;300&#x22;
and &#x22;Watchmen&#x22; respectively. Oh, and she uses quite a great language
for her age too. <br /><br />In conclusion, i&#x27;m sorry to say, this film offers no soul, no moral, no
great characters (nor character development), nothing more than some
seldom laughs and action scenes that has been seen in so many movies
before it. Forgettable, i&#x27;m afraid.
