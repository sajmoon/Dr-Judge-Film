Its been so long since i&#x27;ve been to the theater and was just blown
away. Yes, I will use the pun, Kick Ass does indeed Kick Ass. The movie
is the near flawless mix of Action, Comedy, and yes Drama. It redefines
the Superhero Comedy Subgenre. I will see this movie again this weekend
and I anticipate that it will grow legs due to all the positive word of
mouth endorsements. But this movie is not for everyone, if you have a
problem with kids ***cough 12 yr-old girls cough*** committing acts of
violence then do not see this film. This film is NOT for kids.<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 12+ and for those who liked Kill Bill
and Spiderman. <br /><br />See this film you will love it.
