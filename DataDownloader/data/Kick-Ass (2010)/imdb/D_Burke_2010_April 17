A few dozen films come out every year that are hyped up to the point
where you hear about them at least 20 times a day up until their
theatrical release. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is definitely one of those films. I was
excited to see it, but I tried desperately to keep the preparation to
be disappointed just so not to be let down. So without reading any
reviews beforehand (which, for me, was like being on a deserted island
and trying not to think about water), I kept this question in mind
before and after the movie: Does &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, in fact, kick ass?<br /><br />There were things I loved about &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, most notably the story. The
best way to really enjoy this film is if you know as little about it as
possible, because the film has so many plot twists that would be
shocking enough had it not been for the violence in this film. I&#x27;m a
big action film fan myself, and there was seldom an action sequence in
this film, aided by special effects or not, that didn&#x27;t make me flinch.
If you know nothing about this film going in, you will be entertained
by the action alone, provided you&#x27;re not faint of heart.<br /><br />I also love the premise of this movie, which was really well executed.
I liked the idea that despite comic book movies being the biggest box
office draw of the last decade (if you don&#x27;t count &#x22;Avatar&#x22; (2009),
although that could have been based on a comic), very few real life
people really have tried to be super heroes. There&#x27;s a great dialogue
in the beginning between high school geek and Kick-Ass to be Dave
Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) and his comic book loving pals (Clark Duke and
Evan Peters) about why no one has really tried it in real life. They
delve beyond the obvious reason (i.e. because no one really has super
powers), and make some very good points that also remained hilarious.<br /><br />Dave, despite not being athletic in the slightest or knowing any
fighting skills of any kind, somehow becomes motivated enough to buy a
green and yellow wetsuit online, and use that as his superhero costume.
Without giving too much away, he never really wins a fight, but becomes
a YouTube sensation, attracting the unwanted attention of a mob boss
Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong), and perhaps the wanted attention of real
life superheroes Hit-Girl (11-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz) and Big
Daddy (Nicholas Cage).<br /><br />It&#x27;s when this father and daughter team come into the story that the
film delves into unpredictable territory and enhances the story. A lot
of controversy has been made about Moretz&#x27;s language in the film. Truth
be told, she only says about three or four swear words throughout the
film. Some reviews I couldn&#x27;t avoid made her out to have Joe Pesci
dialogue. Truth be told, the scenes where she&#x27;s killing people are far
more intense than her PG-13 language. Overall, though, Moretz was a
welcome presence on screen whose was well developed as a character and
exhibited a lot of charm throughout the film. She was funny and
unexpectedly warm in &#x22;500 Days of Summer&#x22; (2009), and she&#x27;s the same in
this movie on a different level.<br /><br />I also didn&#x27;t expect to like Cage&#x27;s character as much as I did. The
scenes between him and Moretz are never dull, often times funny, and
surprisingly poignant even when he shoots her point blank in the chest
(you have to see the movie). Cage really could have hammed this role up
to the extreme, and given that he wears glasses in this film, I half
expected him to use that annoying nasally voice he used in &#x22;Peggy Sue
Got Married&#x22; (1986). Fortunately, his performance in this movie was
over the top enough so much so that you still cared enough about the
character. There&#x27;s even a great scene that&#x27;s animated comic book style
which gives the background of Cage&#x27;s character. Once you see that
scene, which tells an awesome story in and of itself, your sympathy
points are hooked on Big Daddy and never let go.<br /><br />Soon enough, another faux superhero falls into the mix, namely
Kick-Ass&#x27; high school acquaintance Chris D&#x27;Amico, who becomes Red Mist
by night and is played by Christopher &#x22;McLovin&#x22; Mintz-Plasse. As much
as I thought Mintz-Plasse was funny in films like &#x22;Superbad&#x22; (2007), I
felt like here he was miscast. There&#x27;s a twist to his character that
you learn not from watching the previews, but one quarter of the way
through the film. His character is important and adds to the story, but
I found myself not knowing whether he was supposed to be funny or not,
and neither did the people who were in the theater with me. I felt as
though the lines he spoke that were meant to be funny fell flat, and
the nasally voice that worked for him as McLovin felt out of place
here. I didn&#x27;t feel he was meant to be a nerdy character in this movie,
and he just felt out of place. Another actor could have played him
better.<br /><br />Revealing more about this film would take away the sheer thrill of it.
Skip the reviews (except this one, of course) and go see it. There is
seldom a dull moment in this film. The violence is very graphic, but
always contributes to the story. The acting is very good so much so
that you care about all the characters. I thought a few lines felt flat
and uninspired here and there, but I recommend &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; because it
kicked ass for the most part. It&#x27;s violent and vulgar in many areas,
making its R-rating well deserved. It&#x27;s still entertaining as hell
without succumbing to mindlessness, and should be viewed on the big
screen. I recommend it!
