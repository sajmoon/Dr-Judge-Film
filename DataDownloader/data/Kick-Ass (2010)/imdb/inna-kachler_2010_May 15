We went together with my husband to watch ANY movie I&#x27;d choose. I
checked with IMDb the ratings and thought this one would be the best.
So, I promised he&#x27;d not be disappointed. <br /><br />First 20 minutes were really boring. I had to say from time to time &#x22;It
would be much better later!&#x22; Then emotions went regularly from &#x22;good
action&#x22; to &#x22;too much blood&#x22;. I mean it was clear that the intention of
the director to exaggerate violence till absurd, but I saw much easier
and better parodies to action movies. Only in the end nervous public
permitted herself to laugh a bit. <br /><br />I was really scared to hear that my choice was not the best. It
was...&#x22;OK&#x22; (I mean - &#x22;anyway, you baby could not do right choices&#x22;).
Others were about the same feelings about the movie, because I did not
hear any discussion after it except &#x22;so, what do we do now?&#x22; <br /><br />Probably, the target audience was 14-25 when most of my poor
&#x22;colleagues&#x22; were 25-45. Probably, European public is different from
American (hope, not) and understand humor without so huge unnecessary
exaggeration (I mean I try to find a reason why the rate is 8.3, almost
high as &#x22;Avatar&#x22; in 3D). <br /><br />Such a budget waste I&#x27;d compare with &#x22;Alice In Wonderland&#x22; - how with
big money, good actors, excellent special effects and interesting
screenplay you could make such a zero thing. You could see &#x22;Hot shot&#x22;
10 times - and it is still funny. You can&#x27;t see &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; more than
once unless you&#x27;re 15 and want to study some of the heroes&#x27; fight
tricks...and receive a kick...<br /><br />Finally, if you check on vote-by-age breakdown at IMDb, the 14-29 rate
1 point it higher than 29+...
