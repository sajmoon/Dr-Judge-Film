I don&#x27;t know about other people, but my expectations were so-so for the
film, because all too often comic type films never meet expectations.
Well there were so many things about this film that were absolutely
great. Lets make a list of things in this move that actually Kick- Ass:<br /><br />WHAT KICKED ASS IN KICK-ASS 1. soundtrack - so many great artists, and
it goes seamlessly with the film. 2. nic cage - turns in a great
performance for a character that provides several goosebumps moments,
at least to me. 3. Chloe Moritz - amazing newcomer to me, but she was
spot on in her relationship with her father. watching her and big daddy
made me feel like i was watching kill bill, but better. 4. what gore -
i didn&#x27;t think it was as gory as everyone made it out to be, but it was
still pretty intense. 5. fight sequences - outstanding! 6. acting -
Andrew Johnson, as Dave/kick-ass actually does a great job holding the
film together. the only other time i saw him in a film was for the
illusionist, and he says like 5 words. 7. mood swings - the plot line
is quite solid, as the film progresses nicely with next to no slow
points. the story is told well, and for a comic/drama/comedy it created
strong emotional changes for not only me but in the characters too. 8.
cinematography - great camera work, very commendable.<br /><br />You take this film for what its worth and realize its not Oscar
material, but it is super well done for its purpose to entertain.
