when i went to see kick-ass, i thought for sure that it was gonna be
another one of those awful spoof movies.....what i watched was
definitely no spoof, it was mind-blowing.<br /><br />the director of this film did a superb job of casting, i honestly don&#x27;t
think he could have done better. Nicholas Cage does an amazing job of
acting, like always, and really pulls you into the story. and whoever
the kid who plays kick-ass himself is, he deserves an award because he
did fantastically. <br /><br />now, this film was nominated for a few trophies at the scream awards,
but, due to all the little weird goth kids, only queer movies dealing
with vampires won anything. so i was very disappointed about that
because i was sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping this film would
win something.<br /><br />its very good to finally see that a film i like gets an honest rating.<br /><br />i only gave this 9 stars instead of 10 mainly because some of the 3d
compositing in the film looks a tad bit cheesy. but, it still looks
good. not incredibly noticeable.<br /><br />all in all, this is a fantastic film that I&#x27;m sure you will very much
enjoy
