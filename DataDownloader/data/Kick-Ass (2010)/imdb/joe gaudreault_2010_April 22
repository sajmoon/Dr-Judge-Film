i just got back from seeing this movie and i felt that this deserved to
get a review this movie isn&#x27;t what you would except out of a average
super hero movie in fact non of the &#x27;&#x27;super heroes&#x27;&#x27; have any super
powers which is something really different and creative. i enjoyed
every last second of this movie and i will definitely go see it again.
but of course every good movie has its flaws i have to admit at some
parts i was a little disappointed but all the other parts definitely
made up for the ones that made me disappointed. this movie is gore
filled and action packed which honestly you really couldn&#x27;t tell from
the preview but trust me from the second you walk into the theater till
the moment you leave you have no idea what to expect.<br /><br />this movie deserves every last star i gave it.<br /><br />enjoy
