It is a very very entertaining movie. It is very well written, the
writers worked really hard on the script. Matthew Vaughn did a great
job, he worked really hard on it. It has elements a entertaining movie
should have. It has good comedy not the comedy that could make you LOL
but the comedy is still good in this movie. The dialogues are really
good, some are very funny, some you would want to remember and some you
will remember. The action scenes are excellent, they are very well
choreographed and I enjoyed them a lot.<br /><br />The actors did a tremendous job in this movie. Senior actor and one of
my favorite Nicolas Cage proved why he still regarded as one of the
best in the industry. Another senior actor Mark Strong continuous to
choose good roles and deliver good performance. Junior actors did their
best, Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse delivered good
performances but the star of this movie for me is very talented Chloe
Grace Moretz, she worked really hard in it.<br /><br />Overall Kick-Ass has almost everything, good comedy, excellent action
and very good acting. Its very fresh and entertaining.
