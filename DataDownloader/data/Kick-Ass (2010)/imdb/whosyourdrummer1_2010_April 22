I reluctantly went to see Kick Ass after hearing much hype about it
from my friends about how they heard it was awesome. After leaving the
film my friends and I generated the same response. It was a good movie
with a few good laughs and some cool action scenes, but it no way did
it deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all time on this website or
any other for that matter. It had a mediocre plot and an okay script,
but there is just something about a 12 year old cussing people out that
kind of bothers me? I understand it is a movie and sometimes her lines
were funny, but it was just awkward. A few one liners kept the laughs
chugging along little by little, but overall everyone who&#x27;s actually
seen it says the same thing that it was pretty good nothing special and
I agree. Comedy is getting lost now because apparently the new
hilarious moments occur when the f word just flies all over the place.
Cool effects though at times stupid sequences. It was a fun movie but
overall it didn&#x27;t deliver everything I thought it would.
