A fresh and innovative take on comic book heroes...<br /><br />Comic Book heroes can be fun and Kick-Ass delivers because it is fun.
Without any superpowers, can you be a super hero. The answer to this
movie is yes, but on the way to the top, you need a car accident, meet
some real life superheroes and some fancy gadgets, then you are almost
there. Still, the movie plays with the audience&#x27;s mind. I am sure, that
a majority of you that grown up watching comic book heroes, dreamt of
the day &#x96; saving the world, killing bad guys and getting the girl
across the horizon near the sunset. Such is the simplicity and fun that
Kick-Ass generates. They are pretentious, but rather director Matthew
Vaughn, combines sleek action, colourful characters, witty dialogue and
even a tone of emotional core and in return creating a kick-ass of a
movie.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson plays the lead role of an ordinary high schooler, who
longs and dreams of one day being a superhero. He is a likable
character that never seems over the top. While, it may well be
unintentional, I believe that his comic timing is spot on. One scene
that catches the eye is when he confesses to the girl of his dreams
(played by Lyndsy Fonseca). Nicholas Cage plays a supporting role as
the father and a real life superhero, avenging the death of his wife.
Sounds clich&#xE9;, but his character is nothing but clich&#xE9;. Cage makes his
character mysterious and despite the violence that he preaches, one can
imagine that only Cage can pull off such a character. However, the
highlight of the whole extravagant must be the emergence of Chloe Grace
Moretz (the wise kid from 500 Days of Summer). Chloe easily plays a
character beyond her age and whether her moves are effects or stunts
enhanced or not, she is the highlight of the movie. In one scene, when
she entered the evil corporation with a school uniform, it reminds me
of Kill Bill. There is no doubt that this kid have potential and rarely
can killing one person after another still equates plenty of fun.<br /><br />All in all, Kick-Ass is a great movie. For all it is worth, I
thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the ride. It is light-hearted, fun,
bloody, realistic, bombastic and finally true to the blue of comic
books. There is even can allusion to John Woo in a question that Cage
asks his daughter, but even without that line, the famous 2 handed gun
sequences is already Woo enough. Kick-Ass is a kind of movie that you
either like it or hate it and luckily, I am the latter. Maybe, I also
dream about being a superhero, but till that day, Kick-Ass works for
me...(Neo 2010) I rate it 8/10
