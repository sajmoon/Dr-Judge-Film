When I first read about this film, I liked what it was saying, I liked
the direction and I liked the bigger picture of the dream of ordinary
people.<br /><br />There are some great lines, great moments, great scenes but it does not
hold together greatly, in fact it is rather badly held together at all.<br /><br />To me, it felt piecemeal, it did not come together anywhere near as
well as it could have done.<br /><br />I felt it deserved the low score because it easily had the potential to
become a great film and even with some possible cult status later on.
However the passion was not there to do it. It feels more like a money
spinner with some up and coming names, a great idea and an old veteran
who could do and has done a lot better.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy and want more from this film. The fact was, I
did want more, but only because it was lacking in so many areas, and
not for the great feature it so easily could have been
