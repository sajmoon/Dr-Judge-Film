I got back from seeing Kick-Ass a few hours ago.I really wanted to see
it as I&#x27;m a fan of superhero movies, especially darker R-rated ones.I
loved Watchmen! Kick-Ass is both a superhero movie and a pretty funny
comedy.Based on the graphic novel which I have not read, the story is
about a nerdy teenager named Dave who decides to become a superhero
named &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;.The problem is that he is not very strong or
skilled.Meanwhile, a father and daughter superhero team named &#x22;Big
Daddy&#x22; and &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22;, who are much more experienced than Kick-Ass is,
decide to meet up with him, and end up saving him from some violent
drug dealers, which the drug dealer thinks kick-ass is responsible
for.The father-daughter pair plan to kill a rich drug dealer because he
framed Big Daddy for drug dealing years ago.Meanwhile Dave falls for
this girl who thinks he is gay due to a rumor being spread at school
and the drug dealer&#x27;s son becomes a vigilante named &#x22;Red Mist&#x22;, just so
he can bring the trio down.Kick-Ass works as a superhero/vigilante
movie, but it also works as a teen movie.We see examples of Dave being
a nerd as well as various pop culture references which would pertain to
teens.This is probably the first R-rated superhero movie to feature
teenagers.The character &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22; is probably the best character in
the film due to her funny profanity-ladden one-liners and ability to
really do damage to the baddies.The actress did a great job portraying
her.Overall, if you like superhero movies or teen movies, then Kick-Ass
is the movie to see!
