Seeing how the audience&#x27;s standards seem to have lowered over the past
decade, I generally expect a movie heralded as &#x22;great&#x22; to be decent,
but almost never great.<br /><br />That&#x27;s where Kick-Ass lies in my book. I enjoyed the ride, and as an
incredibly picky viewer, that says something. The film is, however, far
from perfect - which is forgivable. There were a number of things,
however, that could&#x27;ve been avoided or addressed, that would&#x27;ve helped
the film to be truly great.<br /><br />First, and most notably, is the film&#x27;s outright identity crisis in
theme. In a normal superhero or awesome vigilante tale, we expect a
great amount of suspension of disbelief. Lots of things are going to
happen that are totally unrealistic. That&#x27;s fine. We expect that. Then,
what amount of realism can be injected into the tale is a sort of treat
- it helps with the immersion and seems to give the outlandish stuff
some credibility... At least, enough to keep you involved.<br /><br />With Kick-Ass, however, it was the complete opposite. The first act of
the movie stresses the idea that &#x22;this story is grounded in a realistic
world&#x22;. That&#x27;s fine. But then, later, when the outlandish stuff goes
on... It&#x27;s cool, and I can enjoy it, but it ripped me out of the world
I thought I had just been introduced to. Only now do we understand that
this is more of a mish-mash of themes - that it&#x27;s actually not much
different at heart from other superhero tales. That&#x27;s fine. But what
gives? You got me to LIKE the &#x22;realistic&#x22; side of things. You got me
invested in it. Did you really think you couldn&#x27;t stick to that for the
entire movie, still follow the same plot, and not have it walk away
victorious? Sigh.<br /><br />The music has the same problems. One second we&#x27;re immersed under
hypnotically epic tracks from the films &#x22;28 Days Later&#x22; and &#x22;Sunshine&#x22;
- - then it turns around and prods a pop-rock track at us akin to a
normal &#x22;edgy teen flick&#x22;.<br /><br />In short, I found myself not knowing what to feel at a given moment,
because I was too busy wondering how I should feel about the previous
20 minutes. Speaking of running time, with the amount of scenes that
were drawn out for dramatic effect (only to be resolved in a minute or
two by grandiose action), they could&#x27;ve developed one more superhero
and had him/her die in a gritty, realistic manner. Would&#x27;ve helped.<br /><br />Worst of all was the final reveal of the &#x22;secret weapon&#x22;, which, even
though it exists in the real world, was seriously off the mark. I won&#x27;t
spoil anything, but if the &#x22;secret weapon&#x22; had been revealed to be a
tricked-out grenade launcher, a single mini-gun, one of those armed
robot rover things... Anything along those ends would&#x27;ve sufficed. What
it actually turned out to be was just too much.<br /><br />All in all, I still found my attention fixed on the film, and I did
find myself &#x22;digging it&#x22;. The effort was noble. The result was
well-done. For a little get-away into a movie on a Friday night, I
supposed you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.<br /><br />Kick-Ass kicks ass, but I&#x27;ll have to stick with The Dark Knight as the
best modern superhero flick ... for now. 7/10
