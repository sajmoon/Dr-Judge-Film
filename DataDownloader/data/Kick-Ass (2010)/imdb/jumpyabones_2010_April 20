This movie is a 6, at most. It is fun at times and outrageous at
others. Overall it&#x27;s pretty cool, but you won&#x27;t be missing anything if
you don&#x27;t see it! This just goes to show you what people are into these
days. Little kids fighting grown up&#x27;s?? I mean come one, give me a
break. Aside from being completely un-realistic, kid&#x27;s fighting
grownups is just wrong. Next were going to have movies where kids have
sex with grown up&#x27;s. Where does it all end? It was from shear curiosity
that I continued to watch this movie. I wanted to see how it would end.
Of course they left it open for a sequel, so the thousands of d*mb
asses out there could spend their money on a sequel. IMDb is completely
ridiculous, I cannot believe so many people use this sight! Everyone
swears by it!! Why?? When movies like this are rated in the top 250,
that p*sses me off! What a joke IMDb. I actually have been using it
less lately anyhow. Getting back to what I was saying. I wouldn&#x27;t waste
your time watching this movie, it&#x27;s nothing special. I can&#x27;t believe it
fooled so many! lol, what a joke!!!!! It is so easy to market movies to
people these days!!
