2010_September 6 
Let me say from the start that I am not a fan of comic books/graphic
novels and know almost nothing about them, so I can&#x27;t comment on the
accuracy or otherwise of the translation of this particular example to
the big screen. I can comment, however, on the quality of the movie,
and I have to say that I found it to be intelligent, witty and very
entertaining. There are some excellent and quirky performances,
particularly from Aaron Johnson, Nic Cage and Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />There is some great dialogue in the movie, along with a ton of
gratuitous swearing (which I have no problem with at all) and I&#x27;m sorry
if this sounds childish but I found the conceit of having a young girl
like Chloe dropping the C-bomb to be bloody hilarious! There are also
some great plot twists and turns and genuine surprises, and I&#x27;m a
seasoned enough movie-goer not to be surprised most of the time. I know
it sounds weird, but despite the OTT nature of the movie, most of the
characters seemed &#x22;real&#x22;, particularly Kick-Ass himself, who freely
admits to having no super-powers at all - apart from a huge desire to
do some good in the world...oh, and a great big sack of cojones. The
action sequences were excellent and there are plenty of gory moments.<br /><br />My only problem with it (and it&#x27;s a very minor problem) was that the
writers almost self-consciously set the movie up for the sequel, making
it all too clear where the battle-lines are going to be drawn. It&#x27;s
practically a spoiler, but hey, maybe I&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised. I
thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I hope you do too.
