Kick-Ass is a comic book movie, but it&#x27;s unlike any that have come
before it. Kick-Ass is based on the Mark Miller book of the same name
in which ordinary people, without super powers, begin to run around and
fight crime. The main character of the film is Dave Lizewski, a comic
geek who gets sick and tired of seeing good people getting pushed
around. Dave decides to become Kick-Ass and to fight crime to clean up
the streets. Dave then goes on to get himself deep inside the mob&#x27;s
problems and even inspires more &#x22;super-heroes&#x22; to appear.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Dave as he explains that he has no effect on
the world around him, just that he exists. Him and his two best friends
are comic book nerds, who spend a large portion of their days reading
about flying super-heroes who fight intergalactic battles. Dave decides
that he isn&#x27;t going to be pushed around by thugs anymore and becomes a
real super-hero, calling himself Kick-Ass. Dave&#x27;s first attempt at
fighting crime fails horribly however as he finds himself sent to the
hospital. This accident results in his nerves being ed up and having to
have metal plates places throughout his body, making him immune to
pain.<br /><br />When Dave attempts to fight crime again the movie really picks up, as
he finds himself intertwined with the mob. The mod believe that
Kick-Ass (now famous after being filmed fighting crime) killed some of
their men when in reality it was the Father/Daughter crime fighting
team of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. These two bring in the huge amount of
violence and blood into the movie as unlike Kick-Ass they are not
apposed to shooting a man in the face. The funny thing about Big Daddy
is that even though he is training his daughter to kill people and
buying her weapons for her birthday he is actually a really good and
loving father.<br /><br />The entire run-time of Kick-Ass is pure fun, filled with very strong
writing and acting. The action scenes are great, pumped with adrenaline
and for the most part, very realistic. The direction by Matthew Vaughn
is noticeably great, as the scenes are pieced together and filmed to
great effect. The soundtrack is remarkable and adds another sense of
adrenaline to the scenes. The end of the film is outstanding, and one
of the best climaxes I&#x27;ve seen in a super-hero movie (up there with
Dark Knight and Watchmen).<br /><br />Kick-Ass is a comic book movie, but it&#x27;s unlike any that have come
