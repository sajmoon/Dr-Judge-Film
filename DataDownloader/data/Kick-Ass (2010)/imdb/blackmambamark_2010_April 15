Since &#x22;Iron Man&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, the bar for comic book movies
has been raised to a far grander medium. They showed us that these
movies can be enjoyable, and yet maintain a large amount of depth to
both story and character. Since then, every comic company is
scrambling, trying to mimic their image. Almost all the Marvel
characters, including &#x22;Spiderman&#x22;, are being re-booted, and studios are
scrambling to find the next big thing.....the next hidden gem. Well,
with a name like &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;, it better be one movie that lives up to
it&#x27;s name if it wants to survive.<br /><br />First, let me go ahead and assume that we have all seen
&#x22;Spiderman&#x22;......okay, good........this movie starts out almost the
same way. Geeky kid, no place or purpose, decides that he is going to
finally take on crime himself and become a superhero. Pretty basic, you
kind of expect what is going to happen with this story, seeing that we
have all seen it before......and then BAM! It does a total 180......but
in the most entertaining way possible. And this moment alone, tells you
that this is not your typical superhero movie.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to describe how entertaining this movie is.
Everything from the characters, to the dialogue, to the action
sequences.........this movie is a comic book lovers wet dream. It was
funny, it was gory, and i kid you not, there were some cinematic
sequences in this movie that literally had my jaw in the floor.
Example: One of our famed superhero&#x27;s, a little 9 year old girl, is
blasting the hell out of bad guys to the theme song from &#x22;A Fistfull of
Dollars&#x22;.......i mean that is straight Tarantino. So don&#x27;t be fooled by
all the funny costumes, and somewhat humorous title. This movie has a
great storyline, and told in a very entertaining fashion. And much like
&#x22;Iron Man&#x22;, it deserves to be taken seriously. But don&#x27;t get me wrong,
the movie is filled to the brim with brilliantly placed humor that had
me laughing so hard that i was crying. So to pretty much sum it
up.......its a movie that has everything......action, humor, serious
story, and entertaining characters.<br /><br />Now i simply must talk about the characters. Because they are really
what made this work. It&#x27;s not like most comic book movies, where only
one or maybe two characters are entertaining to watch. In this one,
everyone is worth watching. Each superhero has their own little
personality that makes them so unique, and un-comparable to anyone
else. But even though they are all entertaining......the one that
stands alone, is Hit Girl. I will easily go down in saying that this
character is not only one of the most entertaining superhero&#x27;s every
created, but one of the single most entertaining characters even
written in film. I will not go into any detail, because finding it out
for yourself makes it even better.......but god damn. You remember the
feeling you got when you saw Heath Ledger as the Joker. And you
remember saying to yourself &#x22;Man, they could make a whole movie about
him and it would be awesome&#x22;......yeah, its the same case here. This is
a character that will have everyone talking for years to come......it
was that good.<br /><br />Bottom Line, Another bar in the comic book genre&#x27; has been set. Now i
know that the phrase &#x22;A movie that has everything&#x22; has been tossed
around a lot......but this movie really does have everything. Imagine a
mix between &#x22;Spiderman&#x22;, &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;, and &#x22;Superbad&#x22;......three very
different movies right? But take the best from all three, and you got
this film. Also, one thing that i must touch upon, is the fact that
this movie would have probably failed if it were not rated &#x22;R&#x22;. Because
the fact that this movie takes everything to the edge, makes it fun to
watch. So watch out 2010 Summer Blockbusters, because this movie has
set an incredibly high bar. &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; lives up to its name and more.
