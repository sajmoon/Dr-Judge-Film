When I first bought the ticket I didn&#x27;t know if the film would keep in
touch with the comics but man was I absolutely surprised. The best way
to review this movie is to go against all the stupid controversy.<br /><br />Just watch it and then give an opinion. Trust me, if you&#x27;re an
open-minded movie goer you won&#x27;t regret it. This film is an immaculate
blend of Kill Bill,Spiderman,The Dark Knight,Fight Club,and Superbad.
Amazing. The title itself gives away the feeling the movie evokes: Kick
Ass.<br /><br />JUST WATCH IT!!!!!!<br /><br />YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!!!!!
