As I always first say, I have seen this movie on my PC on a Samsung LCD
17&#x27; with only two speakers.<br /><br />This movie tries to start like a realistic movie, where no one could be
a hero because (obviously) it would be killed in two seconds. But as
story goes on, it starts becoming more like a comic book movie where
there are heroes and the characters do many crazy things. This is
fundamental for you to understand the movie and not criticize it. It is
funny all the way, and action parts are great. The argument for the
movie is good and the soundtrack really gets along with the scenes.<br /><br />I give it an 8 just because I think there are little details that could
have been better, at least for me.
