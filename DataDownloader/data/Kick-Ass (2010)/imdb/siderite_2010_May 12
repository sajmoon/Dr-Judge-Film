I expected a silly super hero movie, although I knew from the extremely
well done publicity that it was a little different from that. Good job
marketing team! However, besides the idea of a geeky Jewish kid
becoming a silly costumed defender of justice for no apparent reason,
the rest was your average teenage hero movie.<br /><br />That doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t deliver the kick ass action, the emotional
content and a little of that Peter and Mary-Jane thing, because it did.
If you take Spiderman, remove his powers, make him even geekier (yes,
it is possible) and then add a slightly demented Batman and his
daughter in the movie as a secondary character, you get Kick Ass.<br /><br />The ending was a little disappointing, as well. If you beat the drums
about the powerless every day kid super hero, don&#x27;t create a ridiculous
action scene at the end that makes no sense tactically, anyway.<br /><br />Bottom line: good for a few laughs, but don&#x27;t take it seriously.
