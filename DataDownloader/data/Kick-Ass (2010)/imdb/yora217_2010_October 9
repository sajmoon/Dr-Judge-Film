This is definitely a new take for super hero movies from the tradition
Batman and Spiderman movies that have been around a lot recently. Its
the story about an average teenager who dreams of winning the girl he
likes and becoming a super hero. Well he achieves both, and the rest of
the movie after that is pretty straightforward. The real star of this
movie is Hit Girl played by the young Chloe Mortez and she is Awesome
in this movie. She is pretty young to be in a movie like this but she
really shines in her role and even out does Nicolas Cage in my opinion,
but he is really good here also. Kick Ass is not really as well
developed as i would have hoped, and i felt like a lot of the parts he
comes out in, especially the beginning the first five-ten minutes were
an utter waste. The Red mist isn&#x27;t really a classy villain and is
really just a kid in a suit trying to gain the approval of his father.
This movie is definitely worth watching again and again, but i found
myself wanting more out of it, i kind of wanted more action from Kick
Ass, since the movie is titled Kick Ass, not hit girl. Still maybe in
the sequel they can focus less on the sex related jokes and references,
and more on the action and story-telling. But yeah, see it if you
haven&#x27;t, its definitely a kick ass movie.
