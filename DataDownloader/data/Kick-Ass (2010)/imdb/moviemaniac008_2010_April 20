Kick-Ass. When I first saw the trailer when I was at the th eaters,
viewing Sherlock Holmes with a friend, I wasn&#x27;t too sure. At first
glance, with the original green band trailer, I felt that it would be a
comedy that would fall flat in the likes of Aaron Seltzer and Jason
Friedberg, those who came up with the horrible Epic Fail (did I just
say fail? I meant Epic Movie), with the okay Meet the Spartans and this
bad disaster film, Disaster Movie. Eventually, my friend invited me
this weekend (opening week-end) to see Kick-Ass, and since I just had a
bit of money to spend, I sighed and said &#x27;&#x27;Why not?&#x27;&#x27;. So, Saturday
night (I went on Sunday), I you-tubed videos of Kick-Ass, and looked
especially at the red-band trailer. And that&#x27;s when I knew it was going
to be a hell of a ride.<br /><br />For those who have only seen the Green-band trailer (Which is horrible,
by the way and does not do the film justice), Kick-Ass seems horrible.
Thankfully, the horrible parts of this trailer only appear in the first
fifteen minutes of the movie (at one point I felt like leaving because
I thought I had just been fooled. Everyone in the auditorium seemed to
be laughing when this dude crashes on top of the car, except me). But I
am really glad that I did stay to see this film. The typical teen
dilemma that happens surrounding Dave (Aaron Johnson) feels highly
realistic (and yes, I am a teen, therefore I could relate a bit to Dave
when he wasn&#x27;t wearing his Kick-Ass costume).<br /><br />The actors were all pretty good. Aaron Johnson is convincing enough as
Dave, and Mark Strong is also awesome (except I felt like I had seen
him do better in other movies, for instance, Sherlock Holmes).
Christopher Mintz-Plasse, whom most of you will recognize as McLovin,
from Superbad, has a terrific performance as Red Mist, whom I will not
spoil too much on. But the main performances I felt were awesome were
Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy, a.k.a Damon Macready) and his supporter,
Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz, a.k.a Mindy Macready). I couldn&#x27;t understand
where all the controversy surrounding her character, because when I was
her age, my friends and I would cuss frequently and play war and kill
many people in different manners in our heads). Hit-Girl got many laugh
out louds from both the audience and myself, whereas Big Daddy had the
most awesome scenes. Heck, I felt like watching an action movie
whenever Big Daddy was on screen.<br /><br />Big Daddy&#x27;s scenes were the best because whenever Nicholas Cage would
wear the costume (basically a look-alike of Batman&#x27;s costume), you
would feel his intensity (Big Daddy does not fight every criminal, only
the ones he feels interfere with his cause, because he has a specific
cause). The music chosen in the background could create with any scene
either an atmosphere of intensity like in the warehouse scene where Big
Daddy kills a lot of bad guys, or a comedic atmosphere, like Dave most
of the time when he does not wear the Kick-Ass costume. Nicholas Cage
is also incredible when it comes to creating many funny moments with
his daughter Mindy. Their chemistry works perfect.<br /><br />Story: Dave is a teen who does not know why nobody has ever tried to be
a superhero. He buys a scuba suit off the internet, and decides he will
become Kick-Ass, a crime fighter. Eventually, Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark
Strong), a mobster, hears about Kick-Ass, he decides he will try to
stop him once and for all. Kick-Ass meets with Big Daddy and Hit-Girl,
and they all team up to fight D&#x27;Amico. Perhaps the best thing about
Kick-Ass is that it&#x27;s different. Nobody has ever really tried to make a
real, laugh-out-loud comedy based on superheroes. The actors work
perfectly, the style is different, the laughs come and go all the time
and perhaps the best is the way the action scenes were filmed. Perhaps
Kick-Ass is a bit too early to be called a blockbuster yet but if
Kick-Ass were to open the blockbuster season, I can definitely predict
an awesome summer. If you are fan of hero movies such as Spider-Man,
Iron Man, Watchmen, etc... then you will find a few winks here and
there. Long live Kick-Ass, and I definitely hope for a sequel.
