Interesting to say the least! If only Tarantino had gotten his little
creative paws on this before Matthew Vaughn did we would have really
seen some kicking ass....Needless to say I thought it dragged a bit and
was going to be beyond ridiculous but like Shoot Em Up did it
eventually grew on me and then some. I will say this and that Chloe
Moretz has a dirty little mouth for her age lol but Hit Girl should&#x27;ve
been the main feature in this graphic comic book adaptation. I loved
the dynamic duo of her and her dad (nic cage) in this. It was also a
cool original storyline which if anyone has the same tastes as me in
film will love this. Loads and loads of guns and violence mixed up in a
bowl always adds for pure enjoyment on my part.
