Kick-Ass This comic book adaptation, full of violence, obscenity,
computerized blood splashing, beatings, knifings, and wild stunts ends
up as one of the best super hero comic adaptations I&#x27;ve seen. The half
a billion-dollar Spiderman series directed by John Favreau could learn
something from this simpler film. In part it&#x27;s the great casting and
cleverer attention to character. Obviously Favreau is hired to make
sure the wise guy persona of Robert Downey and quality acting of the
cast balance an effects laden production. But those performances still
feel gratuitous and studied. Kick-Ass, on the other hand uses
lesser-known actors to build more grounded characters, at least in the
sense of nerds belying superheros. Its literal secret weapon is the
outrageously wonderful 12 year old actress Chloe Grace Moretz (Let Me
In) as Mindy/Hit Girl, and a cautiously underplayed Nicholas Cage as
Her cartoonist-father/Big Daddy. Along with nerd specialist Christopher
Mintz-Plasse, hunk-playing-geek Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass, and a ripe
posse of convincing goons, the movie leaps wildly from wild violent
choreography to sweet cartoonishness. The fresh cast combined with the
extremes of emotional commitment to a ridiculous plot are satisfying
and continually surprising.
