My top movies include Dark Knight, V for Vendetta and now Kick-Ass. I&#x27;m
not a huge comic book fan, but they do tell great stories and their
graphical nature translates beautifully on screen. They make excellent
screenplays, and Kick-Ass is exemplary.<br /><br />Kick-Ass differentiates itself from all the other graphic-novels and
the movies thereafter. It&#x27;s funny and it&#x27;s action-packed, but the great
thing is that this isn&#x27;t a story about superheros. It&#x27;s a story about
someone who says, &#x22;Enough is enough.&#x22; Kick-Ass is tired of people
standing by and watching others become victims. Instead of helping,
people whip out their phones to make a YouTube video. Fear. It consumes
us. For Kick-Ass, his fear takes a back seat to naivety and wishful
thinking. Thus a &#x22;superhero&#x22; is born.<br /><br />The other great thing is this isn&#x27;t a kid&#x27;s movie. It&#x27;s rated R.
Rightfully so. Even though there&#x27;s GREAT comedic content - this movie
is hilarious - it also has serious, gritty, adult content. The only
reason to take the kids is to show them that being a superhero is no
picnic. It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone. I was surprised by the amount
of violence, but it&#x27;s nothing today&#x27;s kids can&#x27;t handle I suppose...<br /><br />It takes every fiber of my body to not dish out the fantastic detail,
but I want to keep this spoiler-free and let you enjoy this great film
- the first must-see movie of the year and one of my new personal
favorites.<br /><br />I also review chick flicks @ RatedChick.com
