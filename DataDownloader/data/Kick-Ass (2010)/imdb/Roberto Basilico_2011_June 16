I was at the point to think that there would have been any more super
hero movie that could surprise me till I saw Kick-ass.<br /><br />Such an amazing work, able to combine a down to heart plot to a super -
hero legend. The movie start kinda like American pie and end like Green
Hornet, having in the middle this surrogates of Batman played by Cage
which is a really funny character &#x22;Big-daddy&#x22;. <br /><br />I am still astonished by the main actor performance which was
unbelievably true and real, also I like the photography and the special
effects.<br /><br />I decided to gave it a 10 as I did for &#x22;the dark knight&#x22; because I
believe this is the light-side of it, or maybe the teenager version
actually.<br /><br />Only thing I don&#x27;t like at times was the soundtrack, actually to pushed
to the &#x22;parodistic&#x22; in some scene, but still it wasn&#x27;t enough bad to
get it down to a 9/10. IT is absolutely a masterpiece and most of all,
an inspiring movie. <br /><br />Kick-ass kick the major ass!
