The movie is a great piece of entertainment. Very funny in that
&#x22;Superbad&#x22;-area of funny. But their mission must have been to interpret
the comic book as a movie. I&#x27;m not completely nuts for thinking that.
And in that case, they failed miserably.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve never seen a comic book movie based so loosely on the original
material as this one. Big Daddy dressed up as Batman? What?! :D I&#x27;m not
questioning the professional abilities of the screenplay writers, but
they definitely did not get or even read the comic book.<br /><br />The narrative and aesthetic style is great, though. Exactly as it
should be. Comic book captions, great visual effects and a well thought
out cast for the look of the characters. The acting is not too shabby
either, though none of the characters are captured spot-on.<br /><br />If not for the writers, this could have been an awesome movie
interpretation of an awesome comic book. The story is almost completely
rewritten, resulting in a mediocre storyline with elements of the plot
forced into it during 3 minute intervals.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and if you haven&#x27;t read the comic book, definitely read it
after watching the film. It&#x27;s so much better, you&#x27;ll sh!t your pants.
