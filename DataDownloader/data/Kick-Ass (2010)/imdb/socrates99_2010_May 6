This is a crowd pleaser set in New England where the sometimes
over-the- top action is populated with the kind of characters any great
story needs. Haven&#x27;t we all wanted to don a cape and mask and even the
score? This amounts to a pleasant dream exploring the notion.<br /><br />I&#x27;d heard a lot of grumbling about Hit Girl especially, but focusing on
that part of this little tour de force is truly a mistake. This movie
is a rousing ode to the sheer pleasure to be gained from stamping out
bad people. Apparently most people don&#x27;t understand Hit Girl&#x27;s fairly
obvious function here, she allows the whole exercise to seem lighter
than air by putting a smile on our face and reassuring us they&#x27;re not
serious about wanting us to take matters in our own hands. It&#x27;s way too
dangerous and we&#x27;ve been made nearly useless from our sedentary lives.<br /><br />Hit Girl&#x27;s a delightful masterstroke and if Chloe Moretz were my kid I
wouldn&#x27;t have the least problem letting her take the role. After all,
how many kids could have pulled it off as well.<br /><br />But Aaron Johnson, the Kick Ass, is no afterthought either. He&#x27;s
completely believable and likable as the overly optimistic teenager. We
ache to see him get in a few licks.
