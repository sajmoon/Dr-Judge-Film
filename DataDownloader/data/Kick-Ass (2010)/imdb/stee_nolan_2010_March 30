When I heard about Kick-Ass, I thought: &#x22;Ah, just another Cheap flick
from the expired taste of the Scary Movie Crew.&#x22; However when I saw the
crew who were behind it (SuperBad, Knocked Up) I ate my words and kept
chewing until the opening night. <br /><br />It was on that night when my friends and I went into view Kick Ass,
expectations at a medium and pessimism at an all time high having
suffered the multiple messes brought about by recent superhero movies
(ala Spiderman 3 and Gi Joe). We certainly did not expect the hilarity
that was to come!<br /><br />Now, I&#x27;m not going to talk about any background regarding the
brilliantly casted characters or the more than fun story line, however
what I will tell you is that Kick Ass is worth the expensive ticket.
Believe the reviews. It&#x27;s just brilliant! <br /><br />Combine the humour of Superbad with an irregular Superhero plot and
watch in pleasure as Kick Ass is born. Lets just put it this way,
there&#x27;s a reason why IMDb rating reads: 8.8/10. You should not be
disappointed! <br /><br />Overall rating <br /><br />10/10
