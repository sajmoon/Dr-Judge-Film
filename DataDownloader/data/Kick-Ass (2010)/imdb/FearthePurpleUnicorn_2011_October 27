We&#x27;ve seen a lot of caped superheros on screen this past decade. A
usually slam-dunk blockbuster, perhaps a major problem is that the
films actually take themselves so seriously, when all in all they&#x27;re a
bunch of men going around wearing tights and capes and who believe they
have superhuman abilities. And they fight giant octopuses and men with
buckets on their head. The superhero genre is actually extremely goofy
when you prod it a little, and many of the careful Hollywood
adaptations seem to ignore that and end up looking quite silly in the
end.<br /><br />So that&#x27;s why there was so much promise in &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;, a film that was
proudly profane, grisly, knowingly over-the-top and ready to throw the
rules by the wayside. What makes it so frustrating is that it sets out
to subvert the caped superhero genre (or at least slyly mock it) and
ends up seeming like a half-hearted attempt to emulate &#x22;Spiderman&#x22;. Or
perhaps &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;, since it ultimately seems to blindly follow
Tarantino&#x27;s style-is-everything film reverence and ends up playing coy
with it&#x27;s real intentions. It wants to thumb it&#x27;s nose at the rulebook
but ends up following it because, well, it just seems to work.
Unfortunately, it keeps &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; from being anything more than an
engaging and very messy near-miss.<br /><br />And while &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is undeniably a modern movie, with it&#x27;s constant
reverence to 24-hour news culture and the social media generation (he
first becomes famous from a youtube clip), but the plot motivations and
eventual repercussions feel strangely hoary. It turns out that the
family who end up sort-of aligning with the wannabe superhero Kick-A$$
(played as the creepiest and deadliest father-daughter wrecking crew in
the history of film) we&#x27;re set up by the... mob. Which perhaps seemed
relevant back in the original issues of Batman. I guess they&#x27;re
motivation couldn&#x27;t be that they we&#x27;re set up by a Goldman Sachs exec
with a sub-prime mortgage, but that might make a few more modern
provocations than the movie seems willing to explore. &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; only
seems willing to highlight contemporary issues when they&#x27;re not that
complicated to deal with. It&#x27;s also not a convenient way to set up the
film&#x27;s many spurts of carnage.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not all bad, though. As the aforementioned mother-daughter team,
Nicholas Cage and young Chole Moretz have a strange but appealing
chemistry, with Cage getting to act on all his weirdest impulses and
Moretz getting to play the most terrifying (and extremely
potty-mouthed) assassins in recent cinematic memory, not the least of
which coming from a sub 5-foot frame. If the movie sometimes treats her
as a bit of a joke (look at the kid say the c-word! Shoot a bajillion
bodies to the floor! Ha!), Moretz as an actress has both an
unpretentious grace and considerable poise that she ultimately rises
above the movie&#x27;s sometimes sloppy handling of her over-stuffed Hit
Girl character. The same can&#x27;t quite be said for Aaron Johnson, as the
eponymous &#x22;superhero&#x22;, or even Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as the mob
boss&#x27;s son and eventual Kick-a$$ nemesis Red Mist, since the movie
actually seems to lose interest in them as the film enters it&#x27;s
climatic Showdown. They&#x27;re ultimately little more than plot devices to
move the story along along rather than the stars of the show.<br /><br />Yep, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; really wants to kick-butt, but instead it never quite
builds on the promise of doing so. It has it&#x27;s moments of wit and
shock, but by the end we end up feeling somewhat sucker-punched. Like
all the promise of a good h-job but finding out too late that the giver
has wet noodles for fingers.
