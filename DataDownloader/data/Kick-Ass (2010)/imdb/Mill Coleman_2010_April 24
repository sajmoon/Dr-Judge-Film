This movie turned out better then I thought it would, and really is
better then advertised. The start of the film (about the first 30
minutes or so) was as bad as I was expecting. I found myself wishing
for a fast-forward button but still managed to care where the story was
going. Then, the plot became interesting as the &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; and &#x22;Big
Daddy&#x22; character arcs came in to play. The story still finishes in a
shallow and unbelievable way but I have to admit that I was
entertained. The kid committing violence controversy didn&#x27;t affect me
one way or the other. Being a comic book fan helps... seeing John
Romita Jr&#x27;s art on the silver screen during the &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22; origin
sequence definitely made me smile. I love his work. While I didn&#x27;t love
this film, I did enjoy myself enough to get my money&#x27;s worth.
