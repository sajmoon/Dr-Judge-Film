Now and again a movie comes along that takes what should be a logical
step forward, but is really a brave and totally blind leap of faith.
Watcing this made me realise how banal and mundane every other movie of
the last 20 years has been.<br /><br />This is simply the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen, wrestling that title from
Pulp Fiction which held it for 17 years. Kick Ass isn&#x27;t necessarily a
better movie, but it&#x27;s refreshing and pushes boundaries that need to be
pushed. We need film makers to innovate, not to rely on re-hashing old
stories and special effects.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz is simply wonderful, in a role that must have been
difficult to define based on the fact that there isn&#x27;t really anything
previous to go by. Mark Strong is an excellent adversary, and Nicolas
Cage actually puts in a reasonable performance too.<br /><br />Any film that can shock you whilst at the same time making you laugh
and cry has to be commended. This story relies on great writing and
acting to achieve that rare goal, not on gore and special effects.<br /><br />This is not going to appeal to everyone, but I believe it is pure
genius and if you aren&#x27;t easily offended, buy the DVD because it&#x27;s one
to keep and watch over and over.
