Super Kick-Ass film. The level of bloody action never disappoints with
a good dose of humour. I have seen the clips and read the reviews.
Thought cool I have to see it to believe it. The story is a about a
typical geeky high school kid who&#x27;s real super power is invisibility to
girls until he decided that he can no longer stand and watch the petty
crimes that takes place. He donned a rubber costume that he bought on
line and decided to do something about it in the form of &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27;. I
won&#x27;t spoil the rest of the story. Just go and watch it. If you are a
fan of hard core comic violence you are in for a treat. Especially
Hit-Girl. You will feel a bit uncomfortable about what looks like a 11
year old girl with killer instincts of The Bride (Urman Thurman)in Kill
Bill, but she is so awesome that every time she is the screen trash
talking or mass murdering you will cheer her on. My bad.
