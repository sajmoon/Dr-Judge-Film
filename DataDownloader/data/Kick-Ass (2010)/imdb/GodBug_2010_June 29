This is a good (non-)superhero movie. It mixes action, drama and comedy
in an interesting way. Extremely interesting.<br /><br />Our hero isn&#x27;t a hero, but he wants to be. So he becomes one, but not
really. Or does he? Revolving around the point of being a hero the
movie brings some confusion. It starts with a noble message, but loses
it towards the end. First it wants to show itself in a realistic light,
but because of that tone you are just more struck about the violence in
the movie. At some points it&#x27;s just cruel.<br /><br />So it leans more and more on the superhero concept throughout the movie
- good guys versus bad guys, extreme mindless action, it even features
a painstaking cliffhanger.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me is the love interest. This isn&#x27;t a
spoiler as it seems that every single movie nowadays needs a lil&#x27; bit
of love. OK, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with being in love, but the way it
develops in the film ... Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a bit rash.<br /><br />Despite writing all of the above the movie is still great to watch.
It&#x27;s no masterpiece, but it&#x27;s an interesting mix of various ingredients
(and other movies) - one minute you&#x27;ll be excited about the action, the
other you&#x27;ll have something to think about, you&#x27;ll have a few moments
to form a smile and there might even be a few minutes where you&#x27;ll be
scared.
