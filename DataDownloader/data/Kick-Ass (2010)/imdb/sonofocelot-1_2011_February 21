2011_February 21 
When I saw the ad campaign over here in England, it was marketed as
just the sort of film I&#x27;d turn my nose up at and wouldn&#x27;t take any
notice of. The campaign showed the 2 or 3 slapstick or obviously funny
moments from the film, and I immediately dismissed it as being another
&#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22; or &#x22;Step Brothers&#x22; type film. That&#x27;s why I saw it a
whole 2 months after release. I&#x27;d heard good things about it from a few
friends so thought I&#x27;d give it a go.<br /><br />This film is just stunning. It&#x27;s the antithesis to the dark knight,
which I kind of enjoyed, but it is the most over-rated film of all
time. This is possibly the most under-rated. There have only been a
handful of films that have gone any sort of distance to changing me as
a person, and it seems odd to be putting this film in the same venn
diagram as the likes of the Shawshank Redemption, Fight Club etc... but
as the end credits rolled, I was left with that numb feeling I live
for, and found myself thinking about my own life, and what it could be.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen Kick-Ass, that&#x27;s going to seem like a chronic
exaggeration, but in my opinion, it deserves everything I&#x27;ve just
written plus more.<br /><br />Kick-Ass just has everything. Some of the best direction I&#x27;ve seen in
years from Matthew Vaughn, who is hardly a familiar face in the film
industry, which just sings his praises even more. When you add to that
some genius camera-work, a script that grabs you by the nuts from scene
one and doesn&#x27;t let go, and some terrific acting (particularly from
newcomer Chloe Moretz as the oh so lovable but oh so vicious hit-girl),
and also one of my favourite ever soundtracks from John Murphy, Ilan
Eshkeri, and others, you&#x27;ve really got a quite frankly stunning film.<br /><br />If you read this and go and watch Kick Ass, you may not enjoy it as
much as I did, but I defy anyone to sit through it&#x27;s 2 hour duration
without laughing, crying, shouting, or just smiling at it&#x27;s sheer
epicness. I did all 4.<br /><br />Any film that makes me leave the cinema and want to ditch my profession
to fight crime in my town gets my vote. Absolutely brilliant.
