This movie is pure awesomeness. I have no idea why I love this movie,
but it is just so enjoyable to watch in all aspects. I watched it
countless times now and it gets better each time. I seriously have no
clue what makes this film so great. All I have to say is see this film
for yourself and experience the awesomeness of it.<br /><br />No feelings can be explained in this film, they can only be felt. It is
like falling in love, where we feel a warm gut wrenching, heart
breaking satisfying feeling linger within us. We don&#x27;t know why and we
don&#x27;t know how, but something is just phenomenally right. I don&#x27;t know
what else to say.
