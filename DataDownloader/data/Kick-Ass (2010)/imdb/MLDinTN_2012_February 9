This movie was pretty cool. Although it does feel disturbing because
there is a little girl, that looks about 12, that murders, maims, and
brutally kills people left and right and has no remorse.<br /><br />The movie is about a high school boy, Dave, whom wonders why there are
no real life superheros, so he decides to invent one, Kick Ass. Only
problem is he is a complete wimp whom has no fighting skills. He lucks
out and saves a guy from some punks and it&#x27;s caught on camera. He
becomes an internet sensation. Soon he gets the affections of the girl
he likes, slight problem is she thinks he&#x27;s gay.<br /><br />There is the big bad crime boss, Frank, whom thinks Kick Ass is messing
with his dealings. However it really is Big Daddy and Hit Girl,
otherwise known as the killing machine. Those 2 have some good fight
scenes and Hit Girl has to save Daddy and Kick Ass at the end and Kick
Ass finally gets some guts and does something to help out.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s targeted for teens.
