an amazing movie i thought it was gonna be some kid&#x27;s stuff but i must
admit that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. the sound
was incredible, big return for Nicholas cage after a series of bad
movies {knowing,bad lieutenant} and a long list of another . he
regained the 90s Nicholas cage the man whom we saw in face/off and con
air. about hit girl i have to admit that i have never heard of her but
her fighting style and the action was good . mark strong comes to
impress me after (SHERLOCK HOLMES) ouch, i forgot the hero kick -ass
who was good. the visual effects were good . is there anyone who knows
who is the girl that performed the role of KATIE .THE SONG IS AMAZING
HEAR IT GUYS
