This is the best &#x22;fake superhero who stumbles upon a crime syndicate
that ruined the career of a cop who&#x27;s now seeking vengeance by training
his pre-pubescent daughter to be a lethal killing machine&#x22; movie that I
have ever seen. The script is clever, the action is intense, and the
violence is cartoonishly operatic. I was disappointed to see Nicolas
Cage (hands down, my least favorite actor, especially since he robbed
Sean Penn of his first Oscar&#x97;I mean, &#x22;Leaving Las Vegas,&#x22; REALLY?
Anyway, I digress&#x85;) in this film, but I was satisfied with his fate.
I&#x27;m not usually a fan of violent chopsocky flicks, but &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; was
definitely a cut above&#x97;not your run-of-the-mill wannabe teenage
superhero flick at all&#x97;I&#x27;m eager for the sequel.
