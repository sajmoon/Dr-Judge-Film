OK first of all, i really cant believe so many people have only give
this movie a 1. I mean OK its not everyones cuppa tea but its worth
more than a 1.<br /><br />Now too the movie, when i heard about this film i thought o hear we go
another super hero wannabe film, but this movie is everything but that,
and to be honest i was totally blown away by this film, i just didn&#x27;t
want it too end, its got it all comedy, action, brutality, tact, grit
and a good storyline too it.<br /><br />Im not really all that good at writing out paragraphs so ill just keep
it short and simple, i would recommend this movie too any1 even those
who doubted superhero movies.<br /><br />a very easy 10/10 from me, watch it you will not be disappointed.
