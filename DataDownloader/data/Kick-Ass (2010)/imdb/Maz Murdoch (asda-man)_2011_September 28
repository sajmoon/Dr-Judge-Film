I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22;. Why did you buy it then? I hear
you cry! Well, because &#x22;Stella&#x22; was doing this fantastic offer where
you can choose from 40 DVD&#x27;s and get one for the price of a text (which
is only 10p or so woohoo! P.S. There are other great alcoholic
beverages apart from &#x22;Stella&#x22;). So I thought ooh, I&#x27;ll try this one
even though I&#x27;m probably going to absolutely hate it even though loads
of people say it&#x27;s great. It turns out that I absolutely loved it and
by the end of it I was quoting Lynne, &#x22;FANTASTIC, LOVED IT! LOVED IT!&#x22;
Whilst nodding my body like one of those desktop bird things. Anyway,
you won&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m on about because I don&#x27;t even know myself.<br /><br />Now I&#x27;ve rabbited on for a whole paragraph about nothing really so
let&#x27;s get on to the film. I was scared that i wasn&#x27;t going to like it
because A. I don&#x27;t like superheroes, B. It&#x27;s in-your-face awkward yanky
humour that&#x27;s portrayed on the TV spots won&#x27;t be to my taste C. I hate
comic adaptations (hello &#x22;Watchmen&#x22;) and D. Nicholos Cage is in it.
Thankfully all of these letters were not a problem one bit. &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22;
should be commended for its inability to portray something that seems
completely believable but at the same time be incredibly outrageous,
like &#x22;The human Centipede 2&#x22;. I was really impressed with how
gorgeously the film was written (by Johanathan Woss&#x27; wife no less,
she&#x27;s obviously got more talent than him... Bloody busy body) it had a
fantastic story to tell which blends humour, action and brilliant
characters almost perfectly.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; was also exactly my humour. As soon as Nicholas Cage shot
his daughter in the chest I knew this film was going to be
fine-diddly-ine. &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; is really funny at times, and most
importantly at the appropriate times. It keeps it&#x27;s entertaining story
and action sequences separate from the humour so that it doesn&#x27;t become
too over-powering and interferes with the story.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; did kind of seem reminiscent of &#x22;Watchmen&#x22;, it&#x27;s almost as
if this is what &#x22;Watchmen&#x22; should&#x27;ve been. Because whereas &#x22;Watchmen&#x22;
is a dreary, pathetic yarn which takes itself way, way, way too
seriously. &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; is an hour and 50 minutes of pure entertainment,
it&#x27;s never boring and is always engaging and exciting. i really didn&#x27;t
want it to end with it&#x27;s incredible action sequences and brilliantly
drawn characters. The directing was really impressive and almost
Quentin Tarantino-esque as it did have that &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22; kind of quality
to it.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; may also seem very kiddish on the cover but please don&#x27;t let
this anywhere near young viewers. It really doesn&#x27;t hold back on its
insane violence and profanity&#x27;s. &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; did get a hard time in the
press because of Hitgirl who&#x27;s basically a mini Uma Thurman from &#x22;Kill
Bill&#x22;. They didn&#x27;t think it was appropriate to let a child swear and
assassinate so many people, but you know what? It&#x27;s all a bit of fun,
and people should open there eyes and not take life quite so seriously.<br /><br />Like I said, &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; is the complete opposite to what i thought it
would be. I never thought that I&#x27;d be sitting here giving it a 10/10
and glowing report. It is perfect in a way. It&#x27;s directed brilliantly,
written fantastically, it has a fabulous soundtrack as well as
characters we can all care about. &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; is pure entertainment and
is the ultimate experience in fun as well as having an interesting
story put there. If you thought you&#x27;d never like it, give it a go.
