Kick-Ass is a pretty wonderful blend of everything. Action, drama,
comedy, romance. It&#x27;s all in there. The action scenes are really where
the film exceeds. They&#x27;re what make the film such a hard-hitting, bone
crunching, blood splattering good time. However, Dave Lizewski seemed
pretty easy to relate to. Just about anybody who has ever picked up a
comic book has wondered about becoming a superhero themself or what
their superpower would be. I related to Dave because I was the same way
in school. Pretty much invisible to everybody. So when he did something
to change that, it spoke volumes.<br /><br />Hit-Girl could be the most entertaining superhero ever. She&#x27;s brutal, a
bad ass, has incredible dialogue, and is only like 11 years old. I had
read somewhere that Chloe Moretz did a lot of her own stunts, as well.
If that&#x27;s true, that just makes me like the character even more.
Hit-Girl is easily the most enjoyable character of the film and steals
every scene she&#x27;s in.<br /><br />While the film is pretty hysterical at times and the adrenaline pumped
action scenes will satisfy any action junkie, there were a few factors
concerning the film that weren&#x27;t quite as good. The way the story
played out, the dialogue, and the acting were all top notch. Even the
special effects, which if you&#x27;ve been reading my reviews long enough
you know how I feel about those, were more than satisfactory. The cast
is where things got a little iffy. Mark Strong, Aaron Johnson, and
Chloe Moretz delivered fantastic performances. The problems lie within
Nic Cage and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Cage was the one person in the
cast I felt weary about. His track record hasn&#x27;t been so hot, as of
late. To tell the truth, he was the best he&#x27;s been in a long time in
Kick-Ass until the end. Then he just decided to go over the top for
some reason. Like Wicker Man &#x22;OH GOD NOT THE BEES! KILLING ME WON&#x27;T
BRING BACK YOUR GODDAMN HONEY!&#x22; over the top. It just ruined what could
have been an exceptional Nicolas Cage performance.<br /><br />As for Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the guy has only been in a handful of
films. The thing is though he&#x27;s McLovin in every one of them. He hasn&#x27;t
really shown any sort of acting range that he didn&#x27;t show in Superbad.
Maybe showing more range hasn&#x27;t been a requirement yet, but right now
he seems to have this Vince Vaughn or Michael Cera repertoire where he
plays the same character over and over again in every project he&#x27;s a
part of.<br /><br />While the film did have a few slight misfires, Kick-Ass is an
incredible ride. Most of the Hit-Girl fight sequences seemed to come
straight out of a John Woo film and yes, that&#x27;s meant as a compliment.
The storyline takes a few unexpected dark turns that the trailers seem
to try and mislead you from, but these turns are enjoyable and only add
to the entertainment value of the film. A fantastic film lead by an
excellent cast. Kick-Ass could very well be the best film to come out
of 2010 so far.
