&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is probably the most illogical logical comic book superhero
movie ever made, and I say that in a good way. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; takes the
idea of the costumed superhero to its illogical, logical extremes by
presenting us an everyday teenager named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson),
who takes his love of comic books a little too far and decides to
become a real-life superhero, donning a costume out of a diving suit he
bought off the Internet (eBay) and becoming embroiled in a deadly mob
war as a result of his costumed theatrics.<br /><br />And thus begins &#x22;Kick-Ass,&#x22; Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s over-the-top, if not
totally stream-lined (and dare I say, slightly &#x22;sanitized&#x22;), adaptation
of the comic book series created by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr.
for Marvel Comics, under the company&#x27;s Icon imprint. I&#x27;ve read the
first volume of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; comics in preparation for this movie and
while I think the comics were way better (largely because of how
vulgar, over-the-top, satirical, and violent the comics were), the
movie is not half-bad. In fact, it&#x27;s very good, despite the many
red-flags it&#x27;s raising.<br /><br />I laughed. My friend who was sitting beside me laughed, too. I laughed
as blood and bodies hit the floor. I laughed as bad guys died horrible
but fitting deaths. I laughed as a foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl
slaughtered bad guys left &#x26; right. (Yes, you read that right, a
foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl slaughters bad guys left &#x26; right.) I
laughed at all the inappropriate times (there never is a real
&#x22;appropriate&#x22; time to laugh at all during this picture.) I laughed at
the utter insanity and absurdity of it all. (I laughed more-so at the
comics, but that&#x27;s a different matter altogether.)<br /><br />Lizewski, like most superheroes in their ordinary civilian lives (such
as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), is not popular with the girls, is the
target of bullies and street muggers alike, and is a nerd who reads too
many comic books. Despite not having any superpowers (he wasn&#x27;t bitten
by a radioactive spider and he&#x27;s not a refugee from a dying alien
planet), it&#x27;s nonetheless a wonder that he soon dons the Kick-Ass suit
and makes a name for himself by taking down a trio of gang members. A
bystander records the action on his cell phone and uploads it to the
Internet, where it goes viral and Kick-Ass becomes an instant media
sensation with a legion of devoted followers and copycats, such as
Chris D&#x27;Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, of &#x22;Superbad&#x22;), who soon takes
to the streets as Red Mist. And that foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl I
was telling you about? Her name is Cindy Macready a.k.a. Hit-Girl
(Chloe Grace Moretz), who is waging a deadly father-daughter war on
organized crime with her father Damon/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), a
conflict that Kick-Ass is inevitably drawn into against his better
judgment.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is a deliriously entertaining, if overly violent and totally
un-PC superhero flick. The movie shows the &#x22;real world&#x22; of superheroes
and the logical consequences of their actions, which can include
serious bodily injury and death, as Our Hero Kick-Ass quickly finds
out. (And I thought My Hero Peter Parker/Spider-Man had it rough.)
While I disliked some of the changes (both minor and major) made for
the movie from the comics, I can say that &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; makes those
changes work, including the hilarious nature of Dave&#x27;s unusual
relationship with a pretty classmate named Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy
Fonseca).<br /><br />I honestly can&#x27;t wait for the sequel. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; kicks a**!<br /><br />10/10
