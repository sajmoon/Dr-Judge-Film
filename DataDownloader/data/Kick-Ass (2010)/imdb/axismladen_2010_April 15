I still can&#x27;t believe how much a movie can surprise you! Even though a
fear was present that it will turn out to be something unfunny like
Hancock, which i&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t, i still expected and hoped it will
be great! Well... It&#x27;s not! IT&#x27;S BRILLIANT! More than brilliant!
Original,fresh and extremely funny and entertaining in every single
aspect! This is not just a movie you&#x27;ll like seeing, this is a movie
you&#x27;ll like seeing again and again and again...<br /><br />Considering what i wrote above, i really don&#x27;t think i should write
anything about how good directing, acting, writing and even Nicholas
Cage, are!!! Not to mention that HIT GIRL is the best, the most
original, the most dangerous and the funniest kid character even to be
seen on movies. If it was me, i&#x27;d give Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) an Oscar
for this role. Magnificent!<br /><br />Kick as is a bloody, and literally &#x27;a bloody&#x27;, classic!!! If there is
an ideal action movie, or an ideal comedy movie, or both of those
together - THIS IS IT!!! Go see it before they raise the price on
ticket&#x27;s, which they would, could and should do considering what you&#x27;re
getting with this movie!!! I can&#x27;t explain how surprised i am with this
movie!!KICK ASS KICKS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
