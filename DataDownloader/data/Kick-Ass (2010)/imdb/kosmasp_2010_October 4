If I had rated it immediately after I watched it, I would have given it
a lower rating. Why is that? One big inconsistency that almost ruined
the movie for me. While it makes fun and is pretty gritty and real at
the beginning, when Nic Cages character (plus the girl) come into play,
it gets into a complete different gear. And (almost) everything that
got made fun of before, is now treated pretty seriously. That&#x27;s a big
risk and very thin line, the movie walks there.<br /><br />Now of course, most people might not even care and just enjoy the ride.
And that&#x27;s what you should do probably too. Plus I&#x27;m happy for the
director, who&#x27;s previous movie didn&#x27;t quite make what I expected it to
make (Stardust is a really good movie, maybe a bit too complex for it&#x27;s
own good ... which is almost true for this one too).<br /><br />One thing is for sure, it doesn&#x27;t hold any punches (or kicks for that
matter) and as many have said, this might be the role to get Mr. Cage
back on track again, after a few missteps. Plus the fact, that it is so
different, makes it a really genuine beast. Something like Scott
Pilgrim does not jump back and forth and is more in tune throughout, in
contrast to this movie ...
