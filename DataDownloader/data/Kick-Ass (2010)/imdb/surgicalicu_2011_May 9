This movie is hardly an 8/10 title as rated here on IMDb. I thought the
plot was conflicted between lame comedy and sappy drama which was
misplaced and inappropriate. Inconsistent moods alternated throughout
the movie as we are asked to sympathize with the main character&#x27;s loss
of his dear mother while alternately laughing at the silly premise of
his desire to become a super hero. The made for TV plot includes a
battle with mafia drug dealers and a randomly inserted gun toting
father-daughter duo which was shallow and made little sense. Add to
this the thin racial subplots and indirect implications which the
director had not the courage to place directly on screen. Laughs were
sparse and clever dialog absent. The whole exercise is an MTV mentality
simple minded cartoon for liberal minded kids and I would not waste my
money if I were you.
