When it comes down to super hero movies, i am not big on them like the
average fan boy. so when i walked into the theater, i was expecting to
walk out disappointed. boy was i wrong, not only did this movie satisfy
my theater experience, but it also put this movie on my all time
favorites 1st. its really sad that this movie isn&#x27;t doing well in
theaters, and i can understand why. (for those who seen it). this movie
isn&#x27;t Hollywood at all and for that reason is why I&#x27;m such a huge fan
of it. the director of the movie gathered all the funds himself because
it was turned down by 7 studios, who thought it was a little much.
honestly WHO CARES.. its a movie, and its not like these people will
actually go out and do it. the movie overall, is exactly as put.. its
&#x22;kill bill meets superbad&#x22;.<br /><br />I recommended that people go and support this movie, for it is art and
these people put their hearts and souls into it. you will not be
disappointing.
