Need I say what I said in the summary? Kick ass was funny and graphic
as hell, the story main focused on a comic book fan Dave Lizewski who
is tired of being bullied around and tired of thinking why people are
not super hero&#x27;s in real life. So he orders a suit online with some
wooden batons (it is never revealed where he got them from) and goes
out into the night to Kick some Ass!, and it ends up horribly! While on
a run he meets &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22; and &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22; they team up only to face a
dreaded fate against New York gang owner Frank D&#x27;Amico. This movie has
the ending that you have to see for self! All in all the movie was
really good the story was awesome and follow-able and the characters
you can really care for! I recommend you leave the kids behind on this
one, and if you love a good laugh what are you waiting for buy or rent
Kick Ass today!
