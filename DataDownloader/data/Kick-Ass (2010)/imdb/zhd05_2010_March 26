Kick-Ass lives up to the hype, and offers a whole lot more. With its
cutting satire on the superhero genre, it has wit in abundance and
packs a comedic punch that is unrivaled by any superhero film to date.<br /><br />Last years Watchmen did its best to portray super-heroes in an everyday
world, however its main flaw was its lack of connection with the
audience. With Kick-Ass set in the modern world, it has a platform to
provide great social commentary and really engage the audience.<br /><br />Case in point: Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), our superhero, is propelled to
internet stardom thanks to a little help from Youtube. Once he becomes
famous, other masked vigilantes begin to reveal themselves. The plot
may become a little obvious once the main details are in place; however
the way each scene is executed is refreshing and exhilarating.<br /><br />The acting from the main cast is top notch, Chloe Moretz who plays
Hit-Girl deserves a special mention. She does steal some of the best
moments, but Kick-Ass, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Big
Daddy (an on-form Nicolas Cage) all have their moments too.<br /><br />So while it may be a little clich&#xE9; to say this film kicked ass, there&#x27;s
no other way of describing it that does it justice. It&#x27;s a welcome
addition to the super hero genre; don&#x27;t miss out.
