This movie was fantastic.<br /><br />People have criticised it so much, and now I know why. The movie is so
impolitically correct, so dark and wrong, that it feels so right!! If
that makes any sense..<br /><br />It&#x27;s the only film I&#x27;ve seen with foul mouthed, kick ass kids,
presented in uncomfortable situations, that I actually enjoyed. It&#x27;s
like digging through the &#x27;things-that-people-don&#x27;t-wanna-know-about&#x27;
folder and adding some real interesting and far fetched action in
between.<br /><br />It&#x27;s worth a watch.
