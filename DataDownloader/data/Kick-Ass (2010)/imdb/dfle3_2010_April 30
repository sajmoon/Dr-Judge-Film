2010_April 30 
The premise of the movie isn&#x27;t actually exciting for an adult...a movie
about child superheroes? Sounds REALLY lame. However, watching a movie
review TV show here in Australia it was mentioned that this movie is
very violent and the male reviewer expressed concern about the scenes
with the young girl superhero. Righto...this could be interesting!<br /><br />Kick Ass is a pastiche of movie genres...it has an indie cinema vibe to
it early on (think &#x22;Juno&#x22;), a teen sex comedy element (think of any
number of American movies where teenage boys try to &#x27;get laid&#x27;), adult
comic vibe (superhero movies with &#x27;dark&#x27; themes and scenes, like the
all time classic &#x22;Watchmen&#x22;) etc. And it all works very well together.
You&#x27;ll see scenes and be able to cross out stylistic &#x27;borrowings&#x27;...be
it &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; or the experience of playing a first person shooter
video game (like &#x22;Doom&#x22;, say).<br /><br />Anyway, the movie starts off like it is going to explore what would
really happen if anyone tried to become a superhero. The reality is
very violent, so it&#x27;s not a movie I&#x27;d recommend for pre-teens. Sure, it
has elements that would appeal to them, but the contrast between
childish notions of superhero-dom and the &#x27;reality&#x27; is very marked and
unsuited to younger children...there&#x27;s some confronting violence in
this movie...by characters such as Hit-Girl and towards her character,
for instance.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass and is appropriately geeky
as a wannabe superhero/lady&#x27;s man. The movie contrasts a geek-boy
fantasy of being a superhero with &#x27;real&#x27; superheroes. In this way the
movie is reasonably novel...the crowd after a &#x27;pure&#x27; superhero movie
may not be so much into these parts of the story.<br /><br />As for the real superheroes in this movie, Chloe Moretz (as &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22;)
is the REAL Kick Ass superhero. Recently superhero movies have been
disappointing me...especially sequels (Transformers 2 is a big
let-down). Moretz transforms and revitalises the genre with a vivacious
performance. She has a really bright aura around her...whereas Batman
was a dull character in The Dark Knight, overshadowed by Ledger&#x27;s
brilliant turn as &#x22;The Joker&#x22;, Hit-Girl makes for an exciting heroine.
And all round, this movie is superior to The Dark Knight...take Ledger
out of that movie and it suffers for the loss. The incongruity of
Hit-Girl (a pre-pubsescent girl) in the superhero genre has really
killed my fatigue with the genre. Getting a bit paternal, it would be
great to see Moretz become a poster girl for climate change scientists
or quantum mechanics...but hey, a career playing Hit-Girl would impress
people more, I suspect.<br /><br />It should be noted though, that Hit-Girl uses very strong language,
which is another reason this movie is unsuitable for very young
children...perhaps. You could say that either Hit-Girl swears like a
policeman or that she brings the language of the playground into
movies. Of course, there was the similarly young Regan in &#x22;The
exorcist&#x22;, but her language was attributed to demonic
possession...Hit-Girl can&#x27;t blame supernatual entitities for her
potty-mouth though...which is why it&#x27;s embedded in realism.<br /><br />Speaking of Batman, Nicolas Cage channels Michael Keaton&#x27;s Batman at
times, in his role as superhero &#x22;Big Daddy&#x22;.<br /><br />Was thinking of giving this movie 10/10. I&#x27;m sure that this movie will
have great repeat viewing potential, but I&#x27;m just marking it down one
point for the bits of pastiche that aren&#x27;t as exciting as the comic
book showdowns...I mean all that geeky stuff.<br /><br />In a way, the prospect of a sequel for this movie is very exciting...be
great to see more of Hit-Girl. However, this is such a great fun movie
you wonder if creating a sequel would sully its legacy...I doubt if I
will see Transformers 3...the first sequel sucked so badly.
