2010_August 25 
There are a few fun action scenes, but they&#x27;re a small proportion of
the overall action, and the movie overall is very poorly structured.
(It&#x27;s two hours long and it takes 40 minutes for the only strong
characters, Nick Cage and Chloe Moretz, to finally appear.) The acting
is so-so, with Cage doing a goofy impersonation and Moretz not terribly
gifted at all -- she sounds like what she is: a little kid saying
lines. The high school &#x22;nerd&#x22; (Aaron Johnson) is too genteel and good-
looking to be considered on the fringe, but his buddies (Clark Duke and
especially Evan Peters) make good funny faces. Superbad&#x27;s Christopher
Mintz-Plasse walks through his uninspired role, unable to play off a
totally dour Mark Strong (who as a comic villain should display some
humor). Michael Rispoli is his usual annoying self, playing what he
always plays, unconvincingly, a rotund little mafioso, but Lyndsy
Fonseca plays the cute girl cutely. Very much a modern Hollywood
vehicle: technically proficient but overloud, overlong and stick
characters were supposed to love immediately. And lots of violence and
bad words to make it edgy. Ugh.
