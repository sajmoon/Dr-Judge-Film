Kick-ass can be summed up as easily as Superbad meets Wanted meets The
Dark Knight.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve read the graphic novel Wanted by Mark Millar but haven&#x27;t gotten
around to reading Kick-Ass just yet but from the movie, it seems he
hasn&#x27;t lost his flair for blending over the top violence, wacky humor
and irony.<br /><br />The trailer was misleading - sure, i didn&#x27;t do a lot of research
heading into this movie. I thought it was going to be one of those
action adventure comedies since Matthew Vaughn was director ala
Stardust with a hint of British cynicism ala Layer Cake. My
expectations were high because of the viral marketing and many
different trailers set loose upon the internet and i was not
disappointed. Not one bit.<br /><br />However i feel that the weak link in the movie was ironically the
eponymous Kick-Ass. His exploits though hilarious and descriptive
narrative throughout the movie aside, i felt somewhat let down by his
role in the movie. He was outshone by the side-characters including the
brilliant Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and precocious Chloe Moretz as
Hit- Girl. Mintz-Plasse whom we all remember from Superbad and Role
Models does a good job as Red Mist and Mark Strong, my favorite actor
villain archetype does a great job once again.<br /><br />This movie is like many people will call it, a fanboys wet dream. It
has it all - just think Superbad meets Wanted meets Dark Knight. A
bloody good combination of movies i think. Dare i say it? The
soundtrack in the movie was Kickass....
