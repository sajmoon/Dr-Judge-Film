Superhero movies . Sounds good ? Yes,of course . This movies are really
attracting and so good . I heard for this movie after I saw few times
its trailer in theaters . It looked so childish . Like some teenage
story which is fool of clich&#xE9;s and many mistakes . With whole cast I
wasn&#x27;t so attracted . Few unknown actors Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage
which I can&#x27;t stand . He is so desperate . I think that this movie was
best promoted movie in Croatia in 2010 . On radio in cinemas ,
everywhere was Kick-Ass . So,now it is time for truth . Is it so good ?
Well,pretty good . When I saw that it is on IMDb Top 250 I couldn&#x27;t
believe . Now I can .<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn as director was pretty good . His imagination mixed with
illuminating elements packed in one entertaining teenage movie . You
have to be master to do it . Great mix of action,comedy and drama .
Sometimes it was on first sight desperate but I don&#x27;t think so . Maybe
this movie looks naive but it is really good . Truly superhero movie .
It has got soul fun and great fight scenes . Maybe it looked ridiculous
but it is well connected and mixed . I liked even soundtrack because it
was good for this movie . Definitely comic book movie because it has
got this specific plot . It has got great narrative parts and nice and
effective action scenes . All in one great directing .<br /><br />Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass . Unexpected good performance . He didn&#x27;t
screw this movie because he showed that his appearance in this movie
was very illuminating . He was serious and completely in his role . He
was great and I can&#x27;t even imagine that he was so good . Maybe
sometimes very good and maybe sometimes very confused . If we know that
he is still young we can say that he has got nice potential for all his
career .<br /><br />Cristopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist was maybe bad . He looked very
unconvincing and too childish . His role was I think more simply than
Kick-Ass . He was bad because he didn&#x27;t look like master as Johnson did
. His performance was confusing and his acting screwed whole movie . He
didn&#x27;t look like some superhero or villain . He looked like some bad
substitution .<br /><br />Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy was so-so . I don&#x27;t like his acting but with
this role of daddy he maybe showed his good side . He did something
very good . He didn&#x27;t look like some drunk man . He was leader in
acting . His acting can be example for this young actors . He looked
like real hero with soul .<br /><br />Mark Strong as main villain was pretty good . He has got this sense for
villain . His appearance was funny because he was like Cage but in
different role . He was realistic and extremely funny and brutal . I
don&#x27;t think that he was bad . He should be nominated for best villain .
He was disciplined and he didn&#x27;t look pathetic .<br /><br />All in one very mature and really entertaining movie .
