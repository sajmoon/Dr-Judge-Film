Kick Ass is a film that has been hyped almost insurmountably. With fan
praise, critical hype, and trailers that showed all kinds of fun, one
wouldn&#x27;t be mistaken to think this film might be over-hyped. But after
seeing the film, one WOULD be mistaken to think this is anything but a
great achievement for comic book films and summer blockbusters.<br /><br />By now, you should know the basic premise of Kick Ass: an average
teenager decides to don a costume and become a superhero. There are no
superpowers, no advanced martial arts training, and Kick Ass is no one
man army. He&#x27;s just a kid tired of no one doing anything about the
bastards of the world. Helping him are Big Daddy and Hit Girl, two
heroes who are highly trained and highly armed, and yes they kick a
great deal of ass. Red Mist joins in on the fun halfway through.
Together they aim to take down the big baddie of the film, the crime
boss running most of NY.<br /><br />The film itself takes a standard formula for comic book films. There is
the progression of becoming the hero: the training, the failures, the
costume creation. The villain is introduced. There are a number of
fights in between and a final battle that has probably the best action
in the whole movie. However, what separates the film from others is
both it&#x27;s brutality and wit. This isn&#x27;t as much of a fantasy film as
say Spider-Man or Batman, where these guys parade around some fantasy
version of their city and use it as a playground to take out
fantastical villains. It&#x27;s all grounded in reality. Several scenes are
brutal, and even a bit gory, reminding you that this is all very much
real. It doesn&#x27;t feel all that exaggerated either. Although the
conclusion is laughably over the top, most of the film is brutal enough
that you feel what these characters are going through. Kick Ass&#x27; very
first endeavor is a good example of this, when everything goes wrong
and it lands him in the hospital for quite a long time. It&#x27;s a reminder
that this experience won&#x27;t be like the others.<br /><br />It helps that the production is fantastic. All the actors do an
excellent job in their respective parts. Aaron Johnson is perfect for
the part as the seemingly nervous and nerdy Lizewski. There will no
doubt be many comparisons to Peter Parker, as they share many similar
qualities, but this one stands out because of his normalcy. As he
explains in the film, he&#x27;s no one special, and this makes him
especially relatable. He&#x27;s the normal guy who&#x27;s simply fed up with
being and seeing people get kicked around. The highlights of the film,
however, are Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy and Hit Girl,
respectively. They steal the show, not just as their superhero alter
ego&#x27;s, but as a daughter and father. Their relationship is both a big
part of the films humor and quite touching. As disturbed as one might
be seeing how they are together, it&#x27;s a sweet relationship that truly
stands out. Mark Strong stands out as the mob boss villain. He could
have played it over the top, but here he seems very fitting as he
portrays an ugly villain that is quite suitable. My one issue is
Christopher Plasse, who may be a bit oddly cast as Red Mist. While he
does channel a little bit of his McLovin into the role, which seems to
work, he seems a bit out of place, especially as the villains son.<br /><br />The rest of the production is admirable. The directing is quite well
done and allows the fight scenes to actually be visible, thankfully,
which is coupled with the editing, which is also excellent, the
warehouse scene being a key highlight. The script is also highly
enjoyable, with quite a bit of wit and humor with all the violence and
drama. <br /><br />Kick Ass is an incredibly enjoyable film that sparks the new season of
film. It stands as the first blockbuster and a testament to comic book
films and what they can be. But above all, this is a fun film that
brings memorable characters to the screen and should leave you smiling
when it&#x27;s all said and done.
