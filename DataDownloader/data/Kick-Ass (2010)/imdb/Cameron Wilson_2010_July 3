My office mates and I decided to watch this one Saturday when things
were slow. I expected to only half pay attention because I thought this
was going to be a stupid kids movie.<br /><br />Little did I know, this movie was full of bad ass violence. The
potty-mouth little girl who kicks everyone&#x27;s ass was amazingly funny.
The other guys were dorks but still played their role.<br /><br />I chuckle every time I think of all the families who took their kids to
see this movie and how horrified they must&#x27;ve been when the little girl
starts stabbing everyone.<br /><br />Epic. Movie. Period.
