What can I say, there is nothing to complain about. This movie is
perfect throughout, from the characters to the soundtrack. At first I
found all the violence, blood and the fact that a 14 year old girl uses
the &#x22;c&#x22; word and murders lots of bad blokes a little bizarre, but
overall I like the whole idea. The humour in the movie is absolutely
fantastic, whether it is the evil character&#x27;s ridiculous approach to
everything (A bazooka? ... okay.), or Kick-Ass&#x27; lack of fortune.
Nicolas Cage&#x27;s role in the movie is somewhat bizarre too, mainly
because (at least to me) he is the best known actor out of all the
cast, however his role isn&#x27;t as big as in some of his other movies.
Either way, this is not something to complain about, just pointing it
out. He is still brilliant. The movie has a lot of action and a great
light-hearted aura around it. I&#x27;d recommend for everyone to watch this,
it really is worth it. Oh and the soundtrack - simply fantastic.
