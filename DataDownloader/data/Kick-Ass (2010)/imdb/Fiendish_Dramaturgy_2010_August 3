I love this film. I can see why some parents are going crazy about the
content, but frankly, if a parent has done his/her job, some
superhero/comic book movie can&#x27;t jade the kiddies as badly as folks are
saying this one will. Get over yourselves, and enjoy the film for the
care-free fun flick it is.<br /><br />Slick production style, relatively low budget, with high quality action
sequences, and some awesome characterizations make for some really
great movie moments. Although this stars one of the kiddies, this movie
may not be appropriate for all ages. The starlet uses some horrible
language and perpetrates some horrible actions, but the film is richer
for it.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage&#x27;s role is below tertiary, but it is wholly enjoyable
seeing him in this endeavor. As usual, he contributes a beautiful
aspect to the story&#x27;s emotionality.<br /><br />All in all? It&#x27;s suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing as long as
your bff/gf isn&#x27;t the churchy type.<br /><br />It rates an 8.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
