Kick Ass starts from a promising point of view.<br /><br />What if anyone could take to the streets and exact protection or
retribution in the role commonly associated with superheroes? Hmmm.
Nice.<br /><br />What if most of these were kids? Hmmm nicer.<br /><br />What if some of them were ultra-tooled-up-mafia-hunting-vigilantes?
Hmmm. Excellent.<br /><br />That&#x27;s what you get with Kick Ass. It&#x27;s a Smorgasbrod of superheroes
from Dark Knight-esquire Batman (in 11 year old girl&#x27;s clothes humming
along to a Tarantino soundtrack) to a young Steve Martin in The
Jerk-like loser role.<br /><br />And that&#x27;s what makes this film ROCK. It really does. Its bad language
is at times shriek out loud funny. &#x22;Is that all you C**** have got?&#x22;
yells 11 year old Hit Girl as she pumps lead into more brains than an
episode of University Challenge.<br /><br />&#x22;Take that you Mother F******.&#x22; When she gets angry.<br /><br />Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is the movie-stealing find of the decade. She
is gobsmackingly in your face as she DESTROYS hundreds of armed thugs
(think O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill, or even better her teenage sidekick
Gogo Yubari).<br /><br />It&#x27;s completely out of order, off the scale, outrageous and freakin&#x27;
hilarious.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is great as a scheming and revenging madman. The scene
where he practices firing pump action bullets into Hit Girl&#x27;s chest is
unique and remarkable.<br /><br />This is a great movie. It sags a touch in the second act but opens and
closes like a wounded rhino.<br /><br />See.<br /><br />At all costs.
