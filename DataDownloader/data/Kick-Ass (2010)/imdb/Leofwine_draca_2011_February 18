KICK ASS is one of those rare films that do what they say on the tin:
it absolutely kicks ass. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I&#x27;d appreciate the zany
humour on offer here, as most of the time I find Hollywood comedy tired
and laborious. This turns out to be a real shot in the arm, a film that
takes great delight in spoofing such silly fare as the umpteenth
Spiderman sequel/reboot and the interminable Iron Man movies. Kudos to
Jane Goldman for writing it and Matthew Vaughn (whose LAYER CAKE I
hated) for directing.<br /><br />The jokes come thick and fast, most of them funny. Aaron Johnson is a
delightful as the ineffectual superhero, but the real star is Chloe
Moretz, whose Hit Girl is probably the most original character in a
film all year. What a surprise, too, to find Nicolas Cage so hilarious,
with his deadpanned impression of Adam West&#x27;s BATMAN another highlight.
The plot moves along at a fair old whack and is loaded with delicious
action and outrageous profanity. The CCTV footage showing Big Daddy
tackling a warehouse full of thugs was wonderful. Mark Strong makes for
another charismatic bad guy, but I&#x27;d like to start seeing him playing
the hero once in a while. Vaughn can&#x27;t help including roles for his old
buddies like Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, but there&#x27;s no harm in
that either. What a breath of fresh air this movie is.
