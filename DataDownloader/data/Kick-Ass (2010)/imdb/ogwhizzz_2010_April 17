This comic book made into a movie is not only the best adaptation I
have ever seen but is a fantastic movie in its own right. If you think
about movie characters in general as being somewhat one-dimensional by
necessity, it stands to reason that comic book characters do not suffer
by being brought to life. Indeed, a comic book is already more or less
a screenplay waiting to be made into a movie. So what does Kick-Ass
have to offer? Great major and minor characters, excellent dialog, a
sense of humor and a lot of guns. Somewhere along the way you will be
drawn into the story line which, even if somewhat predictable,
nonetheless will have you on the edge of your seat. Has it ever been
done before? Sure, but what movie hasn&#x27;t? There is nothing new under
the sun. I left the theater feeling like a teen-ager, despite being
several decades older, and that anything is possible.
