Was looking forward to this movie even though Nicolas Cage is in it
(wow, he really can stink up a movie), and unfortunately, it was a case
of seen that done better in almost every scene.<br /><br />There were about 20 times in this movie where it just did something
stupid, or without proper character motivation, or just plain lame
dialog. I lost interest towards the end, and was glad when it was over,
as the finale was silly and violent, a bad combination.<br /><br />That this movie is in the top 250 is an insult to intelligence, it
really is becoming the world of Idiocracy (look up that movie).<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the movie, simply because the movie does not work
as a feature film. Some short bits with Hit-Girl would be alright, or a
short YouTube video would be acceptable, but as an almost two hour
film, it simply does not hold together. And thank you once again
Nicolas Cage, for totally stinking up the scenes you were in. How can
this guy get several movies a year? Idiocracy indeed.
