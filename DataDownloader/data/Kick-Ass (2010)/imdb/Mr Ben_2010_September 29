2010_September 29 
Probably the only film on my recent flight that I wanted to watch was
this one but due to technical difficulties, I was unable to hear what
was happening even though I had pictures. I won&#x27;t mention the airline
in question but fortunately, the Geek At Work plonked the Blu-ray disc
in my lap so I could watch it after all. Without a doubt, this is one
of the most impressive films of the year so far. It&#x27;s a visually
impressive, graphically violent homage to superhero films of yore
before Marvel smothered everything in highly-polished CG. Except this
isn&#x27;t a superhero movie, despite the secret identities and colourful
outfits.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary kid bumbling through high
school. He has a couple of fellow comic-book fans for friends (Clark
Duke &#x26; Evan Peters) and is ignored by all the girls with the exception
of Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who thinks he&#x27;s gay. Deciding that his life
needs some excitement, he decides to become a crime-fighting superhero
even though he has no powers, athletic ability or even a decent
costume. As the wetsuit-wearing Kick-Ass becomes an internet sensation,
Dave soon finds himself treading on the toes of local Mob boss Frank
D&#x27;Amico (current rent-a-baddie of choice Mark Strong) as well as the
father-and-daughter team of crime-fighters, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage)
and Hit-Girl (show-stopping Chlo&#xEB; Grace Moretz). Has Kick-Ass bitten
off more than he can chew and how can he hope to survive against
D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s goons? <br /><br />Inventive, interesting and very dark, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; feels much more like a
comic-book movie than any of Marvel&#x27;s recent output. Lacking the budget
of another recent comic-book adaptation (namely &#x22;Scott Pilgrim Vs The
World&#x22;), however, doesn&#x27;t hinder &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; in any way - in fact, it
actually makes this feel like a proper action movie. The actors punch,
shoot and blow stuff up like they used to because they&#x27;re not computer
sprites in this, thank God! No doubt that director Matthew Vaughn has
called in a few favours but who cares when it looks, feels and
entertains as good as this does? The cast, mostly unknowns, perform
brilliantly well but no-one can take the film away from the
pink-haired, foul-mouthed Chlo&#xEB; Grace Moretz. She is simply fabulous in
this movie, blowing you away with her performance as easily as she
dispatches the bad guys, usually in a grisly fashion. Cage also
deserves some credit, especially for his Adam West impression which is
simply hilarious. There is a good deal to laugh at in this movie,
assuming you can stomach the violence... which, considering the amount
of violence I&#x27;ve seen over the years in movies, is saying something.
It&#x27;s almost comical but then again, isn&#x27;t that the point? <br /><br />It won&#x27;t be to everybody&#x27;s taste and the plot is quite basic, as you&#x27;d
expect from a comic-book adaptation. But in all honesty, I feel like
I&#x27;m nit-picking because not only is this a real blood-and-guts blast
but it&#x27;s different enough to stand out from the crowd. It even manages
to have something to stay about society and its responsibilities. All
this from a film where a twelve-year-old girl uses language that would
shock a sailor and packs enough firepower to give Rambo a run for his
money. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; certainly does, by the looks of it.
