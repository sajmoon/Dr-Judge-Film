Kick-Ass is by far not a normal superhero movie. First of all, there
are no &#x27;super&#x27;-heroes they are just normal people. All with motives and
personal vendettas that are all perfectly explained through character
development. Which is surprising when many characters are introduced as
random points.<br /><br />The Plot of Kick-Ass is fairly simple. Aaron Johnson plays David
Lewizski, a typical teenager even described by himself as: &#x22;just
existing.&#x22; (As a small note, he is the perfect protagonist for the
target audience of this film.) He spends the majority of his time
reading comic books and fanatically talking about trivial activities
and fantasising about his female teachers. Being such a comic fanatic,
David ponders why no one has ever tried being a super-hero. His friends
quickly respond by insisting that they would get their ass kicked. (A
nice in Joke to the title.) Un-deterred, David pursues his dream and
buys his own costume and weapons. And dubs himself under the pseudonym
&#x22;Kick Ass.&#x22; This provides the premise for the rest of the film which
involves small time crooks and larger mafia style gang warfare. The
result is something like Spiderman 2 combined with Pulp Fiction. And by
the way, the film totally &#x27;Kicks-Ass&#x27;.<br /><br />The film has a gritty reality that is always present and constant
during the course of the film. For example, during his first fight Kick
Ass is stabbed and ran over. Rather than glamorising the life of a
superhero it does quite the opposite by showing the harsh reality, pain
and suffering. This is rather gruesomely shown in a scene in which Kick
Ass and fellow superhero Bid Daddy are tortured by mobsters.<br /><br />Although this is a radical step away from normal convention in
superhero movies, and the juxtaposition of superhero and normal person
is brilliantly portrayed, this is unfortunately a weak spot in the
movie for me. The gritty reality and message is thrown upon the
audience without knowing.<br /><br />Think of it this way, the title &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; suggests a comic superhero
movie that will predominately tongue in cheek. However, this film
completely surprises you and offers no comedy but instead a torture
scene comparable to perhaps reservoir dogs. It is like some kind of
sick joke. The reaction of the people I saw this with were similar. How
did this film become so dark humoured and taboo? Without saying too
much, it is fair to say that there will almost certainly be a sequel to
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;. The title? Perhaps &#x22;Kick some more ass&#x22;. I don&#x27;t know.<br /><br />Whilst I recommend you watch this film, I seriously recommend you
expect the unexpected. Some things may come as a surprise.
