Don&#x27;t believe the hype. The only things you haven&#x27;t seen here before
are a pretty funny Adam West impression from Cage, and the sight of an
eleven year old girl killing henchmen (if that does it for you). The
first hour is some pretty lame high-school American-Pie/Superbad-ish
comedy that segues into some pretty ill-natured and nasty-edged
violence (that is rarely justified). The film never really has the
satirical bite it promises and it ends up becoming a pretty standard
action movie heavily reliant on guns (I thought this was supposed to be
a super-hero movie?!). It also quickly rejects its &#x22;real world &#x96; real
physics&#x22; premise pretty quickly, which blunts the entire point of the
film. <br /><br />By far the best thing about the film is the action scenes - which are
pretty well made and fairly originally shot - though they tend to leave
a bit of a bad taste in the mouth, owing to the fact there aren&#x27;t any
really likable characters in the film and the whole plot is pretty
morally bankrupt. There is also a hugely uncomfortable scene with Hit-
Girl in a school uniform which makes you feel like you&#x27;ve stumbled
across an illegal website. <br /><br />In the end the film feels far too much like a too many other movies
(though obviously genre references are essential) to have much of it&#x27;s
own identity (Watchmen, Spiderman, Superbad, Kill Bill, etc.) It&#x27;s also
not nearly funny enough to be a comedy - shoot me down but I honestly
found the underrated Mystery Men funnier, and that was over ten years
ago!<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t excited about this film until seeing the reviews, and having
seen it, I&#x27;m now pretty confident that the fawning reviews of the UK
media (it came out here a few weeks before US) have been heavily
influenced by editors insistent on giving a film with so much UK talent
(star, director, writer etc) good reviews. It all smacks of back-
scratching/palm greasing. This is nowhere near a five star film, and
I&#x27;m keeping my hopes up that the upcoming &#x22;Defendor&#x22; better delivers on
the promise of a similar premise.
