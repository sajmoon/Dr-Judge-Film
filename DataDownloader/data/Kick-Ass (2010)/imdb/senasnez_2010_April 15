A special message from the director of &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; - <br /><br />&#x22;Oh boy, I am going to make soooooo much money from this film, or
should I say, from the scenes of a young girl slashing and shooting
Mafioso to hell. Hahaha! I&#x27;m a skilled filmmaker and a smart guy, but
you know, sometimes these qualities aren&#x27;t enough to bring you all you
deserve in life. Bring on Hit Girl &#x96; and show me the money!! <br /><br />Let me tell you a little secret: if your film is smart, hip, funny and
has a few touching moments, lotsa people will accept all sorts of nasty
stuff thrown in. Wouldn&#x27;t they look unsophisticated and humdrum in
front of their friends and peers if they didn&#x27;t!! Yep, I&#x27;ve covered all
the bases, ladies and gentleman.<br /><br />Of course I&#x27;ve also publicly stated that fans of the Kick Ass comic
would kill me if I held back on the violence. It&#x27;s a pretty pat and
convenient excuse, but the amazing thing is, no one has thus far taken
me to task for it. Who said indifference is a bad thing? Certainly not
my savings account, hehe! <br /><br />On the other hand, I really worry about how jaded and apathetic so many
people in society have become. As a filmmaker and a businessman, this
poses a real challenge, but I feel we have overcome it with &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;!
Hit Girl is a shot in the arm for all and sundry. People are fighting
the good fight, silencing the uncool who have voiced dismay at our
adding a young girl to all this awesome savagery. (All in good fun!) It
is inspiring to read and watch&#x85;and I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m getting any
poorer in the process, hehe!<br /><br />You know guys, life is grrrreat!!!&#x22;
