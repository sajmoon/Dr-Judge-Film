I purposefully try not to read too much about a movie if I might go and
see it. I don&#x27;t want to risk spoiling my experience by taking any
preconceived ideas along with me. This was the case for Kick-Ass, I&#x27;d
read some thing about it being something like &#x22;self aware&#x22; or something
to this affect, whatever it was it appeared to mean to me that it was
not a corny comedy directed at &#x22;the average&#x22; teenager but something a
bit deeper. So I didn&#x27;t read much more because I had decided that I
might go see it. Admittedly this strategy hasn&#x27;t worked out for me
before as well.<br /><br />Today I went to see Kick-Ass. Extreme violence perpetrated by a
pre-pubescent girl peppered with foul language doesn&#x27;t really impress
me. The post-pubescent, but clearly lagging behind in the maturity
department, behind me seemed to find these parts &#x22;funny&#x22;, as did a fair
percentage of the audience. I&#x27;ll give the audience the benefit of the
doubt though, often embarrassment is covered up by a burst of laughter.<br /><br />Was this film that bad? No it wasn&#x27;t terrible, it was just not very, or
even much good either.
