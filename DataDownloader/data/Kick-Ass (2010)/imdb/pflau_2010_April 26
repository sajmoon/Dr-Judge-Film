I don&#x27;t often write reviews but I just have to write this. Chloe Moretz
absolutely owns every scene she&#x27;s in as Hit-Girl in this movie. Every
word that comes out of her mouth exudes coolness. The squint, the
sneer, the pauses between words, the gestures. Who taught her to do
that? Who was her acting coach? And the scene in the bowling ally with
Nic Cage, where she started laughing just before she told him she was
just messing with him, that expression was priceless. And the way she
said &#x22;I never play&#x22; before the final confrontation, that little bit of
a Christopher Walken mannerism, that was exquisite. I&#x27;ve seen Angelina
Jolie in Mr and Mrs Smith and Wanted and let me tell you, as good as
Jolie is, she&#x27;s got nothing on this kid. Watching her reminds me the
first time I watched Clint Eastwood in A Fistful Of Dollar. I kept
telling myself, this guy must be the coolest guy ever to appear on
screen. His every little gesture is absolutely magnetic. That&#x27;s how I
felt when I watch Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass. Sadly there won&#x27;t be a
sequel, or so I hope, as she has grown too old to reprise the role.
