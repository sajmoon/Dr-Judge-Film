Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan
who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no
powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.<br /><br />Superhero movies have lost originality, have loads of clich&#xE9;, and every
bit of it has become bland. In 2010, however, Kick-Ass has introduced
us to a new breed of superheros and has designed it&#x27;s own genre. A
mixture of ultra-violence, comedy, and pure awesomeness. The trailer is
a bit sketchy and made me have no intention of seeing the film in the
first place. This changing when I saw the reviews. Kick-Ass, for one,
is hilarious! I expected humor, but the humor is great and somewhat
infused with dark comedy. The acting (surprisingly) was great and even
Nicholas Cage did an good job. Then the plot (sounding extremely
clich&#xE9;) introduces new ideas and just pure fun. The ultra-violence was
a change too and made this film even more unique. The rising director
has lots in store for him and hearing of the sequel, I have high hopes.
Kick-Ass is definitely a highlight of 2010 and will draw you in to a
pop-cultured world, as of ours today, and will definitely want you to
re-watch with friends. 10/10.
