The naysayers always forgetting some points of view inside this movie,
of course, violence over children isn&#x27;t new today, but the missed point
it&#x27;s too simple, child generations today are capable of spread more
violence than adults... yeah, Internet and the phenomenon of YouTube,
tweeter, myspace and other social web rings only make more easier a
kind of new values coming and raising from the mass media: violence
over our kids become more violent kids and the pleasure of watch a
bunch of muth@f*ckers beating to death their victims without motive
isn&#x27;t enough to think something wrong is happen in our &#x22;society&#x22;?,
children involved in war, forced to be recruited in militias, children
victim of abuse or children in a gang war...etc, etc OK...really stupid
entertainment, but conscienceless, of course not
