the reason why I gave this movie a 9 is, because even though the
trailer of the movie made it look as if it was a mediocre but funny
parody on all the bad super hero movies of our time. It was actually
seriously KICK ASS.<br /><br />The movie was refreshingly good and has a 10 for originality and had a
better plot than most super hero movies(batman was still better of
course). The plot was really cool because it mixed complete absurdity
with realistic events and even tough the whole movie was unrealistic
you really get sucked as if your a little kid looking at your first
action movie ever. but the action and violence in this movie is better
then in any other SHM(super hero movie) I have ever see. I think its
pity that the movie was marketed as a marvel parody the first scene in
the movie implies it by putting the text MARV big on the screen.Which
is stupid because its nothing like a parody and it doesn&#x27;t do movie any
justice .
