I have to say, out of all the technicalities that make a movie good,
you never really think of &#x22;editing.&#x22; But in all seriousness, the
editing of this flick is so great, that even if it had horrible
characters or plot, I&#x27;d still want to see it again.<br /><br />Thankfully that&#x27;s not the case. Kick-ass has a ton of fun characters,
my favorite of which are the father and daughter (Big Daddy and Hit
Girl). They all have an array of quirks that don&#x27;t overwhelm their
whole presence, and they all play off one another very well in a darkly
humorous plot. That being said, the only problem I had with this movie
was that it may have been too serious. It&#x27;s a satire movie with very
few laugh-out-loud jokes, but it doesn&#x27;t make it any less enjoyable. I
went into the movie expecting a boatload of jokes, but ended up getting
a surprisingly dark experience. But it doesn&#x27;t stop the fact that this
is a fun movie from start to finish.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the Zombieland of super hero flicks. It may not
be as funny as the trailer made it out to be, but it&#x27;s well made, well
executed and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
