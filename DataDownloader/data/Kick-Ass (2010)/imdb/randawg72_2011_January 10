I enjoyed this movie a lot, by far my favorite of 2010. I unfortunately
missed it in the Theater but discovered it later on DVD.<br /><br />I expected (like most people I know) a cheesy &#x27;Superbad&#x27; type superhero
movie, boy was I wrong. A simple but engaging story, excellent
directing and perfect casting. Great performances by Aaron Johnson,
Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that superhero fans have always hoped for.
It&#x27;s made like it really could happen in real life. not with multi
thousand dollar costumes &#x26; props like the 100 million dollar
&#x27;Hollywood&#x27; versions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It&#x27;s entertaining and
satisfying from start to finish. I&#x27;ve seen it several times and could
sit down and watch it again anytime.<br /><br />(I can&#x27;t wait for the sequel !).<br /><br />Sincerely, ~Randawg.
