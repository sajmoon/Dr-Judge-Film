Joe Johnston&#x27;s The Rocketeer was by far his underrated work from the
early 1990s with a great set, some wonderful characters, an engaging
story, brilliant action scenes, and a riveting music score from James
Horner, but suffered from it&#x27;s disbelief in the Dialogue and the
credibility of it&#x27;s pacing.<br /><br />This film, succeeds in also being the most underrated superhero flick
in the history of cinema with a top notch cast (Aaron Johnson,
Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Mark Strong, Chlo&#xEB; Moretz, and Nicolas Cage),
action scenes that are highly stylized and perfectly choreographed,
humorous moments that would make you laugh your butt off, and music
that is so rousing it might be worth listening to.<br /><br />OK, I never read the graphic novel and I can&#x27;t make some comparisons,
but even though I wasn&#x27;t bored and ended up laughing my butt off, I
found the story uneven and troubling with it&#x27;s violence. I mean, lots
of broken bones and body parts... talk about a blood bath. Two other
problems with the film, however, were the shallow Dialogue and it&#x27;s
inconsistent pacing.<br /><br />Overall, a little troubling with the violence throughout the film, but
has a great cast along with groundbreaking action, laugh-out-loud
moments, and some touching moments (including the scene where Hit
Girl&#x27;s father Big Daddy dies) which makes this superhero flick worth
watching for die-hard fans of the graphic novel this was based on.
