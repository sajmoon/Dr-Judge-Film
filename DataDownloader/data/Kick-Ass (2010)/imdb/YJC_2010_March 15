Saw this at an advanced screening today. Saw Kick Ass. It wasn&#x27;t as
good as I expected it to be but I expect it to be very popular. It is
as good as the Hangover to comic book fans. Even if you don&#x27;t like
comic books it is pretty hilarious-- really hilarious. It is a tad bit
vulgar but perfect for teens and young adults. Also, it is very similar
to Tarantino and Taxi Driver, except more.. Hollywood. It&#x27;s a bit
different. Nic Cage is the same as ever. I didn&#x27;t like Mintz-Plasse
(McLovin) in this film, it wasn&#x27;t quite his character. But I loved Hit
Girl. It was like the director watched tons of comic book movies and
tried to imitate the style but missed a bit as in there were moments
when the film dragged. AMAZING fight scenes though like Repo Men.<br /><br />I think Hit Girl will soon have a very big fan club though. I believe
in Hit Girl. (:
