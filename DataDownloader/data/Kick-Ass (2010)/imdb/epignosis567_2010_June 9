Because it was awesome! I had read about it, including an article the
new yorker did and some reviews, I&#x27;d seen a preview too but I still
expected it to be pretty stupid and a 20somethig comedy. I&#x27;ll tell you
though, I have used IMDb since it started, for YEARS and this is MY
FIRST REVIEW! because this movie was fantastic. The new yorker article
was talking about the exploitation of hit girl, and the sexualization
of a minors, and all the violence, and I might normally agree in other
instances but they were WAY off base. This is not a movie for kids, but
I think there is nothing wrong with it. If anything it captured the
depravity of corrupted youth more honestly than I have ever seen. And
if you don&#x27;t think so you&#x27;re kidding yourself. And you be very
surprised to spend anytime as a kid again living these days. The
nonchalant sex and drug use was spot on. That&#x27;s not something that is
portrayed honestly in America. It&#x27;s either written too stiff or worse
too cool. This movie was hilarious and I will be buying the DVD and
doing whatever else I can to support the filmmakers. I am truly shocked
at how much I liked this movie. After how many years it compelled me to
write a review on here. I don&#x27;t do that. Enough said.
