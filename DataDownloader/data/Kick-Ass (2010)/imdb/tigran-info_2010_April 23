I have to admit I couldn&#x27;t expect such a low-level movie from the maker
of Stardust. Inspired by the modern and extremely popular &#x22;bloody&#x22;
comics it proves once again how amoral most people implicitly are. Many
reviewers describe that they were thrilled by watching teen girl&#x27;s
ability to cut its enemies into pieces - I feel sorry for them...<br /><br />For sure, it will have its deteriorating effect on the value creation
of &#x22;soft brained&#x22; youth. Because their parents are busy with their
&#x22;very important&#x22; tasks 365 days a year their children treat movie/media
and internet as their primary &#x22;life mentors&#x22;... One could only wonder
how children can grow normal if everything surrounding them is so
spoiled and filled with so many dangers.<br /><br />Think - why you enjoy watching movie where child is a bloody killer?!? <br /><br />Well, there should be a moral limit in movies as well - it&#x27;s not a game
- it is real.
