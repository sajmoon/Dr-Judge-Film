The movie plot was nothing that I expected but that was not what made
this movie terrible, it could give it a special touch. However the
story tat followed was just boring and looked more like a childish
Disney adventure with a predictable ending.<br /><br />What I also disliked was the terrible acting of some characters.
Nicholas Cage (after his terrible acting in Bad Lieutenant) showed here
again that he is not a top actor. The characters that played the Mafia
and the kid of the Mafia boss were also terrible.<br /><br />This is a movie that I recommend only when you have really nothing to
do and no other interesting movies are showing.
