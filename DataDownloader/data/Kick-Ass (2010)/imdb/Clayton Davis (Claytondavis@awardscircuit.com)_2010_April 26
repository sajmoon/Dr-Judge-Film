From Matthew Vaughn, director of Stardust and Layer Cake, the man takes
a stab at the comic book genre, Kick-Ass. While the film bodes well for
entertainment and the average Friday night visit to the movies,
Kick-Ass doesn&#x27;t offer any heart and soul to withstand any real social
or film-making significance. Vaughn seems to be very inspired by
Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film style but rather then use it as a foundation,
he copies it in the most awkward way and delivers second rate results.<br /><br />With an ensemble of all up-and-comers, and Nicolas Cage, Kick-Ass
enables its players to dig somewhat deep within themselves to bare real
emotions, however, minimal delivery and story arch don&#x27;t lead to any
substantial moments. Of the players, Aaron Johnson who plays the brave
superhero &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; carries the audiences affection. With his
breakthrough performance in Nowhere Boy last year, Johnson will sure to
be one of Hollywood&#x27;s bright lights.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz as the vulgar and spunky &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22; is surely a fan
favorite character, however, I found her character completely annoying.
Her fight sequences, as most of the film, are simply awesome and red
hot fire, but as soon as dialogue is shared with any of her co-stars,
worst of all Nicolas Cage as &#x22;Big Daddy,&#x22; eyes roll. And what Nicolas
Cage seems to be doing these days is stop trying altogether on acting.
He&#x27;s showing an eclectic taste in choosing movie roles which I can
appreciate but he&#x27;s lost all sight of what he showed us in the mid-90&#x27;s
when he won his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. He&#x27;s stopped chasing that
moment again.<br /><br />Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or as you may know him better as &#x22;McLovin&#x22;
from Superbad, remains his A-typical role with no acting range. As
awesome as Mintz has been in his last roles, he seems to be locked in
this type of &#x22;struggling, teen depression angst&#x22; performances. I&#x27;m
waiting on something more.<br /><br />As this looks like a negative review of Vaughn&#x27;s film, my experience is
not a bad one by any means. Kick-Ass is pure entertainment though a tad
too long but it gets chuckles and smiles along the way. It shows
something different which is worthy for a look.<br /><br />**1/2/****
