2009_December 4 
Well where I can begin. I was invited to view the preview and write a
short review over this movie KICKASS. I must say I entered the theatre
with a very sceptical approach (i was assuming i would rate the movie
4/10), the tag line for the film did not appeal to me and I expected
the aimed audience to be for teenagers.<br /><br />I was shocked to see unique character chemistry between nick and his
little one (you will find out when u watch it people). This film is
very exciting and I ended up giving it a rating of 7/10 because I must
say I have not seen a movie like this before. I actually enjoyed this
movie very much....after half way. But none the less it was very well
choreographed with the fight and action scenes with good but rare
humour. Is this film violent......YES! Is the film straight to the
point with the action....YES? Is this film worth watching.....YES! Was
I impressed....YES I must say I proudly flaunted the idea to my friends
that I had the opportunity to see it first.<br /><br />But it took to long to start...&#x22;the film&#x22; if you know what i mean<br /><br />I&#x27;m not a film critic hehe although I was sitting next to one at the
time and he mirrored my feelings towards the movie.... He said at the
end &#x22;Well!! Did u like it?&#x22; I replied...&#x22;hmmm very different and I
would watch it again although it was slow paced to begin with&#x22; He
replied...&#x22;yeh could do with a bit of snipping, and then it would be
just fine!&#x22; And we talked over and over the scenes we couldn&#x27;t get
enough of, which I think every person will feel is the same after
watching this movie.. it is like a modern day 300 hehe<br /><br />So don&#x27;t expect me to be deep in detail because I am to busy saving the
world right now.<br /><br />rating 7/10 people get out there and watch it!!
