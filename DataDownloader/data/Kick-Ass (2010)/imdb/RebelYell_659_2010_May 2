I went in expecting to see something along the lines of Superbad.
Superbad this movie was not. More like Leon The Professional meets
Quinton Tarantino.<br /><br />I took both my daughter and son. One is early twenties and my daughter
is a teen. They both loved it and said it was one of their favorite
movies.<br /><br />It earned its R rating but it was fun, fun, fun.<br /><br />A big thumbs up for Kick Ass.<br /><br />There is nothing in this movie that romanticizes violence or that would
encourage your child to take on a super hero personality. So don&#x27;t
fear. The characters are believable and this is destined to be a cult
classic.
