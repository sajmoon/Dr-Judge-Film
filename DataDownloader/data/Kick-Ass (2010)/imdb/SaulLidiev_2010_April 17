I have never thought a movie like this would so bad ass. I must admit,
I was never really anything in high school of course I knew how to
draw, but that really can&#x27;t count in anything in the popularity status
for me. Adding to that I read comics whenever I could, especially those
batman comics. <br /><br />So when I heard this movie last year I was curious what a movie like
this would be. Obviously I knew a movie like this would based on a
graphic novel. Didn&#x27;t expect that it was written by the author of The
Ultimates, Mark Millar. All I am going to say about the graphic novel,
that was hell of bloody. Sure the movie didn&#x27;t follow exactly like the
movie but it had its true essence, it was bloody.<br /><br />Hit-girl is compared to Punisher in the essence of how far they will
go, sure she was eleven years old, and her dad is called Big Daddy
ironically, recruited her for his mission to gain vengeance on the drug
lord Frank A&#x27;mica. Kickass, truthfully is a lame superhero, especially
without having superpowers. If I was going to be a superhero I would
not just get a suit and then expect to kick butt which Dave Lizewski
did. He should have thought well what he was going to do, but the
thrill of dressing up in tights has a certain aroma that can not be
denied. <br /><br />To sum it up I liked it the movie and I&#x27;ll give a two thumbs up if you
want something that has a good soundtrack and explosions to satisfied
your eyes
