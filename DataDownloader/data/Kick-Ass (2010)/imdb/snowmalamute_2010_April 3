An original look at comic &#x22;heroes&#x22;. Very smart movie. It makes you
think it&#x27;s a comic based film, but it has so much more to offer. It
never loses touch with reality. The little girl steals the show, she
really kicks some ass, but we were reminded she&#x27;s just a little girl no
matter how mature she appears to be. The second last action scene is
one of the best I&#x27;ve seen recently. Highly recommended! People who
criticise this film because of the violence and the little girl needs
to wake up. This is a film, and it is not inspired by a true story, if
you believe everything you see is a bad example then maybe you should
not watch any films at all.
