On first impression, kick ass looks a little bit like a parody of
superheroes which i think it ultimately is, albeit a more serious
parody. I was really moved by the beginning of the movie where the hero
kick-ass, played by Aaron johnson, is upset with the world as they let
crime go unpunished even as it happened right in front of them. Being a
comic book nerd that he is, he acts on his initiative and orders a
wetsuit online for his superhero costume and thus, kick-ass is born.
The beginning was definitely kick-ass. But the plot,story and my
attention starts to disintegrate after that. <br /><br />I didn&#x27;t get to like any of the characters that much except for big
daddy and hit-girl. They&#x27;re actually more kick-ass than kick-ass
himself. In fact, those 2 are the ONLY THINGS in the movie that makes
kick-ass KICK ASS. The story does not have a cohesive flow. More like a
jumbled mix. In my opinion, the story would have been nicer if it
followed Big daddy and hit-girl and they were the actual main
characters. The movie does give you a few laughs here and there but it
doesn&#x27;t fully deserve to be called funny. <br /><br />You just sort of lose focus after awhile because there are too many
things happening and it doesn&#x27;t have that emotional pull. In the end,
you feel like the movie barely accomplished anything. Once again, if
the story had followed big daddy and hit-girl, it would have meant
something. Kick-ass was a sideshow small fry throughout the movie. And
you really expected great things from him. And that line he gave before
he finished off the main antagonist was so cheesy. It was actually
pretty gutsy for a wimpy small fry.<br /><br />Overall, through kick-ass side of the story, you get more hilarious, a
bit touching and romance thing. For big daddy and hit-girl, you get
sweet loving family, REAL kick ass fight scenes and emotional sad
parts. The 2 stories clash which makes it a jumbled mess. Sort of like
trying to be serious and funny with romance on the side and betrayal
but fails horribly.<br /><br />The fight scenes were really great! I&#x27;d say the fight scenes alone was
what made up my rating of 5 stars. It was slick, stylish and
gratifying. Very violent and graphic as well. Only thing that made the
movie worth watching to me. I&#x27;m sure the comic book was awesome but the
movie sucked.
