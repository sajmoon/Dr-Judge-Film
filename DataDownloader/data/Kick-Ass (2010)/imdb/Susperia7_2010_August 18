This movie is brilliant. It made me laugh and it also had me fighting
back the tears. You actually care for the characters in it. The action
in it is great. The violence is strong, but it is R-Rated and only
unfit parents would take their children to see an R-Rated film in the
first place. For those of you people who have real life expectations
then don&#x27;t go see movies at all because you won&#x27;t find it there. This
movie has made it into my Top 10 favorites of all time. There is a
reason this movie has an 8.1 out of 10 rating with 77,000 people
voting. Other websites also rank this movie high, because it is what it
is a Master Piece.
