One of the three best comic movies ever! In the beginning you may find
it stupid, you may think of it as of some jackass teenage comedy. So
just wait about eight minutes, because after those you&#x27;ll be given a
fantastic action/comedy/drama about bunch of kids playing superheros.
But it&#x27;s totally not for kids.<br /><br />In the beginning, this movie is very realistic, almost cruel. Later on
it gets more action and surreal but still fu**ing awesome! It has one
of the best action endings ever. Soundtrack is great, it fits with the
movie perfectly.<br /><br />I can tell you - this movie rocked my world. I really gotta see it at
least once more.<br /><br />P.S.: I&#x27;m sorry for commas placed wrong in the sentences, we Czechs
have a bit different grammatic for commas ;)
