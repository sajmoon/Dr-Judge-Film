I had no idea what to think of this movie when i saw the trailer. It&#x27;s
a very darkly humorous movie and if you find a 10 year old slaughtering
gangsters then don&#x27;t watch the movie and go give it a bad review. The
cinematography was great the acting was good and the screenplay was
funny and very real. Some of the characters are very relatable and the
movie isn&#x27;t so unrealistic that it ruins the movie. The plot wasn&#x27;t
stunning but it does not bring the movie down. The fight scenes are
flawless and the humor was great. A lot like avatar this movie is
actually fun to watch i actually had a great time watching the movie.
Do not pass this movie up, it is worth the money
