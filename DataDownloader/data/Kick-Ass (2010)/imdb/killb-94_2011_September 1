Kick-Ass is my all time favorite movie. Why? Because it has EVERYTHING
I always love: surreal images, dark comedy, over the top jokes,
dramatic intensity, superheroes, the atmosphere and most of all great
character and plot development. One of my favorite comic books is Leo
Ortolani&#x27;s &#x22;Rat-Man&#x22;, and Kick-Ass looks come kind of live action movie
with humans of it; a comic book about superheroes that really makes you
understand why they are so great and their true messages. This movie is
a crazy mess: it&#x27;s a comedy movie, an action movie, a high school
movie, a dramatic movie and of course a superhero movie! It&#x27;s hard to
put all those genres fit in one movie and make it all work right, but
when that happens, the final result is amazing. Some special effects
may look cartooned and spectacular, but can also get very creepy and
disturbing. Much like the tone of the movie: a real live action comic
book, which I really appreciate since I&#x27;m a cartoonist aspirant. The
only downfall of this movie in my opinion is the romantic story between
Dave and Kathy, it was seriously rushed and impossible to work, even in
a weird movie like this one. But aside of that, I truly adore Kick-Ass,
I love how worth it is, I love how dark it is, I love how strange to
the point it is and I also love how unpredictable and deep it is.<br /><br />It&#x27;s unique, it&#x27;s creative, it&#x27;s my all time favorite Movie.
