There&#x27;s not much else around these days that can offer this much comedy
and action in one movie. I really really liked this movie, loved it in
fact. The most original of its kind in my opinion. For me Chloe Moretz
was my favourite because i wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great and comedic
performance. Went into the movies not expecting very much because the
trailers looked awful but i was in stitches within 2 minutes of the
movie. Don&#x27;t understand the odd people that say its the worst movie
they&#x27;ve ever seen because it does&#x27;nt get any better than this. And i
love during the fight scenes the great music they pick and the slow
motion is really cool. So yeah, do not miss out on this one please!!!
