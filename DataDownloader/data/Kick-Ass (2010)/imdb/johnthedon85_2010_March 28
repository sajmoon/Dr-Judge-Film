Being in Cinema management I had the foresight that Kick Ass was &#x22;one
to watch&#x22;. I saw some scenes at a Universal Film day and thought that
it was warming up nicely...this film was never going to disappoint.<br /><br />Its Superbad with a sprinkling of Spiderman and Kill Bill. Kids in
costume going on the offensive against the crime lords. It is well
written and sparkles with gore and humour.<br /><br />The lead actor, Aaron Johnson is very Michael Cera-esquire but that is
not a bad thing. It is a very fashionable film comedy era indeed and
spoof movies are all grown up with emotion and deep characters.<br /><br />I think if I am being over critical some of the fight scenes were a
blur and perhaps some better use of slow-motion effects might have
broken this up.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favourite films of the year so far!
