I have to say that Kick-Ass pretty much kicked ass. The previews for
the movie are very misleading, it&#x27;s not a spoof movie at all but rather
it is a movie about would-be superheroes in the real world, sort of.
Dave is a nerdy high school student that is perpetually being mugged
outside the comic shop he frequents. Lamenting the fact that people
often witness crimes and do nothing he decides to do what nobody has
done before, become a superhero. Kick-Ass has no powers, no training,
no gimmicks or gadgets, just a great deal of idealism and naivety, and
that&#x27;s all he needs.<br /><br />At first he is wildly unsuccessful, landing himself in the intensive
care unit after attempting to stop a car theft. Eventually he manages
to do some good and the video taken by onlookers becomes an internet
sensation. This inspires Damon (Nicholas Cage) and his eleven year old
daughter, Mindy, whom Damon has been training since she was five to be
a combat expert, to join the fight against evil. Damon becomes Big
Daddy, a cross between Batman and The Punisher, and Mindy becomes Hit
Girl. The action sequences with Hit Girl are straight out of The
Matrix. It is very surreal to watch an eleven year old dispatch bad
guys with guns, knives, swords, and skilled martial arts, but it is
very entertaining.<br /><br />The operations of the new superheroes put them into direct conflict
with the local drug kingpin, Frank D&#x27;Amico. A series of traps,
shootouts, deceptions, and brawls leads to the final climax of heroes
vs. villains inside the skyscraper headquarters of the drug kingpin. Is
the movie a satire? Perhaps, but I sense more that it is a reflection
of the writer&#x27;s wish that there really were superheroes. If you are
offended by the idea of a little girl kicking ass and taking names I
suggest you not see this film. However, if you like to be entertained I
do recommend Kick-Ass.
