3 words can pretty much sum up the film Kick Ass... &#x22;Fu#@ing KICK ASS&#x22;<br /><br />But don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;m going to go more in depth then that:<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is an unnoticed high school student and comic book fan
who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though he has no
powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.<br /><br />Kick Ass was really a unique and awesome cinema experience. I can
honestly say that I&#x27;ve never seen a film quite like this one. It is
most definitely not a typical &#x22;superhero&#x22; movie and is definitely
targeted at an adult audience. The way the story flowed was impeccable,
It starts off as this comedic type of teenage film with this teenage
boy wanting to be a superhero and believing that he can do it, and then
it turns into this dark-comedy/action/drama with immense violence and
killing. It really is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen before. Each and
every single character had their own unique quality and greatness.<br /><br />I must say that this film is going to be VERY controversial and has
already raised much controversy in its early birth in the cinema. The
reason for this controversy surrounds the 11 year old character, Hit
Girl. I did not find this a problem at all, in fact i absolutely loved
the originality of her as a character and I love the fact this film did
something that no other film has dared to do, but I can tell you right
now that conservative people are going to be concerned. I say it&#x27;s
cinema, so deal with it.<br /><br />This film has such a mixture of genres and a mixture of different
things occurring that it is hard to narrow it down to one genre. The
action sequences are near perfectly shot and look amazing. They really
get your adrenaline pumping and your heart pounding with fear and
excitement.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic. Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl is the &#x27;coolest&#x27;
performance from a young actor I&#x27;ve ever seen, and she plays one of the
&#x27;coolest&#x27; character&#x27;s ever!!. Now i have not read the comics, but she
was perfect as Hit-Girl in my opinion. Finally I have seen a film where
I liked Nicholas Cage&#x27;s performance. He was great as &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; and
the seriousness and utter obsession of his character was brilliantly
delivered by Cage. Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass was great as well and the
ever delightful Christopher Mintz-Plasse was great as &#x27;Red Mist&#x27;.<br /><br />Overall after seeing this film you will feel a very mixed range of
emotions. I&#x27;m very excited that I got to see this totally original
cinema experience on opening night and it is a film that I may never
forget. It&#x27;s shocking, disturbing, exciting, original and down right
Kick Ass!.<br /><br />*To all you movie buffs - Go And See This Film... trust me.
