I was very skeptical about seeing this movie: it looked like another
one of those stupid trying-to-be-funny kid romps. Then i saw that it
was a controversial over the top violent action movie, so i said, hey,
why not. I went to see it with a friend and we both had the same
verdict. TWO THUMBS DOWN. I thought ONE line was funny, the rest was
just what I thought it would be: teens and little kids TRYING to be
funny. I also don&#x27;t mind brutal action movies, but NOT starring little
kids. I was honestly pleasantly surprised that Ebert gave this movie 1
and a half stars. The action scenes were great, but only if they had
been done by grownup. If these kids were in an all out comedy, that
would be different, but they weren&#x27;t so...I am probably the only one
who hated this movie, but that just my humble opinion.
