We watched the better part of Hollywood&#x27;s latest pile of filth called
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, before its mindless, gratuitous violence drove me from the
theater before it ended. As we went up the aisle to leave, I stole a
glance at the dark faces in the theater and wondered if any of them
chuckled in a similar manner when they saw videotaped beheadings of
abductees in Iraq, where men screamed for prolonged periods of time
because it took that long to saw through the bones in their necks. For
many of all ages, this has actually become entertainment. Would it take
something tragic like this to happen to someone in their own lives
before they snap out of their misdirected notions of entertainment?
People have become so insulated from reality that they&#x27;ve lost the
concept of what torture and killing actually are.<br /><br />I never for a moment understood the appeal of slasher movies and I quit
watching commercial TV because it is so permeated with jaded rot, but
we all know about today&#x27;s crime shows that depict the most gruesome
killings imaginable, and a wildly popular show that actually glorifies
serial killing. Hollywood even made a slasher musical that passes
itself off as &#x22;serious&#x22; and &#x22;artful&#x22;. But even a repulsive film like
&#x22;Sweeney Todd&#x22; had some originality and cinematic virtue, endless
scenes of slit throats and splattered blood notwithstanding. But
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; had none of this. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; was just adolescent pap that
laughs at torture. Nicholas Cage was nothing but a poor portrayal in a
used Batman suit. Even more repulsive was corporate Hollywood&#x27;s device
of using a cute, trash-talking hero girl to draw in younger audiences
(like my daughter, which is why we went). What it did instead was
inspire my daughter to pledge to sell her Playstation 2 and its equally
mindless depictions of violence. Not wanting to let a good thing pass
by, I handed her instead a pick-axe and safety glasses, and she made
the sparks fly off that piece-of-crap &#x22;toy&#x22;. She made me proud.<br /><br />It is perplexing how otherwise intelligent and kind people that I know,
love and somewhat respect, can be so easily misdirected into believing
that moronic filth like &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is entertainment.
