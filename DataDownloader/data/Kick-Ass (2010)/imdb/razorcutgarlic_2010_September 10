This movie has great action sequences, great comedy, and genuine drama.
Don&#x27;t miss out on the fun. I don&#x27;t want to get into too much detail,
don&#x27;t spoil the movie for yourselves, just watch the film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of action movies, this will not disappoint. As far as
the controversy, its an R-rated movie thats meant for adults. Just
watched another r-rated film for adults called &#x22;the Prophet&#x22; which
literally made me wince and almost have to look away from the screen.
Kick-Ass is fun cartoon violence that I really believe kids as young as
twelve could watch and not be traumatized by.<br /><br />People have always been fascinated by violence and enjoy watching it.
This is such cartoonish violence, no one could possibly take it
seriously.
