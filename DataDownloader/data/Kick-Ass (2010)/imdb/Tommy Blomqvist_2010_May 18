Usually I don&#x27;t like comic book movies but this one is really cool and
interesting. Even Nicolas Cage, who I normally have some big issues
with, makes a pretty solid effort.<br /><br />I must admit that without the character Hit Girl this movie would have
scored less than now. But by no way could the movie be without Kick
Ass, Red Mist or Big Daddy. In fact every character seems to be exactly
what this movie needs and makes this something that you sooner or later
need to watch.<br /><br />But again, Hit Girl is the new definition of COOL. I do not know much
about Chloe Moretz who plays her but this could be to her little like
Leon was to Natalie Portman (there are more than one similarities
between &#x22;Mathilda&#x22; and &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22;).<br /><br />This movie has many references to films like Kill Bill, Spiderman and
many more. But strangely I think this movie somehow beats them all.
