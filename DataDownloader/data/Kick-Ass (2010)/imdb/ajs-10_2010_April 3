2010_April 3 
I saw this film when it first came out in the cinema and really enjoyed
it. This week it came to our TV screens in a slightly cut version
(about 4 minutes shorter than the theatrical release) but that didn&#x27;t
spoil my enjoyment of it. It was one of the best films I saw last year
and the filmmakers will have to work hard to beat it again this year!
If anything, I enjoyed it more second time around (if that&#x27;s
possible!). But enough of my prattling on, here&#x27;s a short summary
before I give you my thoughts (summary haters and those that don&#x27;t wish
to know anything about the plot please practice swearing with Hit Girl
while I write the next paragraph).<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is an average teenage school kid, he says he has one
superpower, he&#x27;s invisible to girls. He and his friends, Marty and
Todd, are into comic books and after hanging out one evening they are
mugged by a couple of scumbags. It seems this is not the first time
this has happened and Dave is getting a little fed-up with it. He goes
online and gets himself a costume, a green wet-suit. After a bit of
self-training, he decides he&#x27;s ready and &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; is born. He decides
to confront the two muggers who held up him and his friends but things
don&#x27;t go well and he ends up having his ass kicked. After recovering in
hospital and being screwed together with metal plates he finds his
nerve endings are a bit damaged, which means he can take a bit more of
a beating than before. Meanwhile, a real Superhero known as &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;
is training his eleven year old daughter, &#x27;Hit Girl&#x27;. They have a
grudge against crime boss Frank D&#x27;Amico who framed &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; some
years before. D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s son, Chris is disillusioned with his father and
decides to become a Superhero himself, called Red Mist in order to lure
Kick-Ass out of hiding. They blame Kick-Ass for some losses they have
been suffering recently. Kick-Ass eventually gains notoriety when he
beats up three guys picking on another guy. The fight is filmed and put
up on the internet, bringing a lot of media interest in Kick-Ass. Dave
is also noticed by Katie Deauxma, although she doesn&#x27;t know his secret
identity, and thinks he&#x27;s gay. I won&#x27;t say too much more, but needless
to say all of these various characters are destined to meet, and when
they do&#x85; I&#x27;ll have to leave it there or I&#x27;ll be having a knock at the
door from the &#x27;Spoiler Police&#x27; (&#x26; I don&#x27;t want that).<br /><br />I must first say that it is a really well made film with some excellent
stunt work. I thought the music chosen for the score was really great
as well. Excellent performances from all of the leading cast, Aaron
Johnson as Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cage as Damon Macready/Big
Daddy, Chloe Moretz as Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl, Mark Strong as Frank
D&#x27;Amico, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris D&#x27;Amico/Red Mist and Lyndsy
Fonseca as Katie Deauxma.<br /><br />There is a lot of humour in this film, both spoken and visual. It&#x27;s
also very very violent, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to those of a
nervous disposition. I don&#x27;t usually enjoy teen comedies, but this is
very original, very different and it&#x27;s very refreshing to see a film
that pushes the boundaries somewhat. It&#x27;s a film that any superhero
film fan should try to watch at least once a year and I recommend it
very highly! My score: 9.2/10
