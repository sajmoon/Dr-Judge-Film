It was a great movie. It reminds me of action movies like Kill bill,
and comedies like Superbad. This was one of the greatest movies I have
ever seen in my life. It had great humor, great action, and a great
story. I had a fun time with this movie. Like when Hitgirl had made it
thorough a bunch of bad guys, by killing them all!! I was completely
entertained by this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is
the perfect movie. If you hate this movie, then please check out again.
The loved that a kid tries to be a superhero in this movie, and that is
a perfect sign of originality. In fact, forget it. Go see the d**n
movie.
