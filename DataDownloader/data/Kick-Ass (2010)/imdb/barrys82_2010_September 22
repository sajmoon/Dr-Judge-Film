What will happen if one good day someone decides to be a superhero just
because he wants to. Well that&#x27;s what this movie suggests us. Kick-Ass
tells the story of Dave Lizewski an ordinary New York teenager and
rabid comic-book geek that becomes the no nonsense vigilante Kick-Ass.
As Kick- Ass gets drawn into this no-holds-barred world, the stage is
set for a final showdown between the forces of good and evil. Kick-Ass
is the adaptation of the comic book of the same name created by Mark
Millar. It is original, entertaining, full of action, adventure and a
very good and dark humor. The cast is formed bye Aaron Johnson as
Kick-Ass, Nicolas Cafe in the role of Big Daddy, Mark Strong as Frank
D&#x27;Amico, Christopher Mintz- Plasse (a.k.a McLovin) as Red Mist and
Chloe Moretz performing as Hit Girl. Everyone delivers excellent
performances specially Moretz and Johnson. In conclusion, Kick-Ass is a
movie that will leave you 2 hours of pure enjoyable action. It is very
recommendable.
