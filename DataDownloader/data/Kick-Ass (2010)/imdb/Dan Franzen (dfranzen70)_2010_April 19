Although exceptionally &#x96; perhaps even abhorrently, depending on your
view &#x96; violent and wildly profane, Kick-Ass is terrific, a
pulse-quickening superhero movie that somehow manages to have a subtle
message about staying true to yourself, or something.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just another anonymous geek in high
school when he comes up with the idea of becoming a superhero. Not one
with, you know, super powers or anything, just one with a mask and good
intentions. Dave buys a wetsuit and costumes himself as the eponymous
hero &#x96; and quickly finds himself on the wrong end of a knife. But
that&#x27;s okay, too, because the resulting surgeries implant metal in his
body. You know, like Wolverine. Soon, he&#x27;s back and, uh, kicking ass,
and his exploits are all over YouTube.<br /><br />At the same time, a mob boss named D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong) is running all
sorts of deals all over the city: weapons, drugs, graft, murder, and so
on. Then eight of his guys are knocked out by a costumed man, and
D&#x27;Amico &#x96; with the help of his sniveling son Chris (Christopher
Mintz-Plasse) &#x96; decides Kick-Ass is his man, since he&#x27;s basically the
only costumed hero anyone knows about. Soon D&#x27;Amico and his well-armed
minions are after poor, hapless Dave. Turns out that the costumed man
trying to take down D&#x27;Amico is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), who, with his
deceptively adorable daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), has been
targeting D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s operations in a sort of revenge game.<br /><br />There are a few wonderful themes being developed in this film. One is
that ordinary guys can do extraordinary things. Another is that the
geek can get the girl, as long as he&#x27;s honest. A third is that even
well-prepared heroes bleed from time to time. Kick-Ass is part
Spider-Man and part Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s World of Comic-Book Heroes.
Now, it&#x27;s true that these themes may not be all that unique,
particularly to movies, but the essential take-away point is that the
heroes here are infused with no small amount of humanity. They are in
no way, shape, or form perfect people; they simply are.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski doesn&#x27;t suddenly become awesome when he wears his
Kick-Ass costume; he&#x27;s a great person, daring to stand up for the
little guy. When he sees the level of training that Hit Girl and Big
Daddy have achieved, he knows he&#x27;s in over his head. But the experience
gives him the confidence to connect with a previously unattainable
high-school hottie, Katie. Echoes of Spider-Man, sure, but somehow
Johnson is a little more believable than Tobey Maguire.<br /><br />The violence is pretty visceral &#x96; bad guys are mowed down in
cold-blooded fashion by ostensibly good guys &#x96; but what might really
grab you is the incredibly adult performance by Moretz. She&#x27;s 13, by
the way, and she looks like she&#x27;s 11, but here she talks like she&#x27;s a
grizzled pirate. Moretz uses all of the Carlin dirty words and some
more you might not have heard of. It&#x27;s a little off-putting to hear
such a tiny little squirt use such language, especially while engaging
in bloody, realistic combat, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to learn that
her role is viewed with some controversy. Moretz&#x27;s Hit Girl is very
reminiscent of Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1, but her Kewpie Doll
looks serve an even greater contrast to her intentions and actions.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is both evocative and heart warming. It&#x27;s not the kind of
movie you watch while cuddling with a honey, though, as its sweeter
side is mostly kept in the background. But it&#x27;s those sweet moments
that help prevent the film from being a rudderless mess.
