Maybe people enjoy being fed something for their target demographic,
but this is just building on the &#x22;loner-loser&#x22; hipster fetish that
seems to be in every movie released. The main character is just a
Michael Cera look-alike for Christ&#x27;s sake, doesn&#x27;t anybody get tired of
this emasculated male crap? I&#x27;m not a fanboy nor do I know the source
material, but it shouldn&#x27;t be required. This just wasn&#x27;t a good movie.
It&#x27;s another in a long line of teen-themed hipster genre movies that
pretends it has a meaningful undercurrent but instead just falls flat.<br /><br />It also hits on the same &#x22;shocking&#x22; notes as a lot of other films that
look to be &#x27;edgy&#x27; without putting in any effort for real social
commentary. I&#x27;ve seen countless films in the last 3 or so years with
casual cocaine use, children swearing/acting like adults, casual high
school homosexuality, sudden knee-jerk violence, etc. It&#x27;s not
shocking, edgy, socially conscious or even fun any more. It&#x27;s just
tired and played out, unoriginal. Same old crap.<br /><br />Besides its &#x22;edginess&#x22; there&#x27;s just a very hallow, very tired superhero
plot arc, complete with boring fanfare music and worn out origin
stories. They throw in elements from classic teen movies that play out
exactly as you would expect. The narrative, or what most folks would
call the merit of the movie, plays like it came out of an instruction
manual. There&#x27;s no creativity here. <br /><br />The violence isn&#x27;t even as shocking or surprising as they pretend it
is. I&#x27;ve seen cheap action movies from the 80s with more original
graphic violence, not to say such a thing is high art or difficult to
do. It&#x27;s just silly and especially pointless in a self-aware movie like
this one.<br /><br />Keep shoveling on the crybaby teens mixed-genre movies so the box
office is drained and Hollywood can move on.<br /><br />Avoid. 2/10
