Pure stupid clear American humor.LOT OF VIOLENCE. Judging this rating i
thought i would face a great sweet comedy or at least a captivating
action movie. THE beginning of the film haven&#x27;t promised anything so as
the end did. NOTHING TO LEARN,nothing to enjoy,or even to laugh,just an
usual stupid American comedy with useless and wasteful elements.
OK.Acting was good,LOVED THE GIRL.But what about sense? what about the
meaning of the movie? isn&#x27;t it supposed to teach something,to underline
some human qualities some happenings that will guide us somehow through
life? TOO MUCH VIOLENCE.I really really didn&#x27;t love it at all.And i
don&#x27;t recommend it to kids,cause is psychological strong adapted,so
parents take your children to a simple beautiful animation,don&#x27;t
destroy your kids innocence with such movies. OK from me its 5 cause
the actors did a good job,but for the plot and idea is 0. And i simply
don&#x27;t understand how it comes that people loved this film,have i missed
something and there is a hidden purpose?
