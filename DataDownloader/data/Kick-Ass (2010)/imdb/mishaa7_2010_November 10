Another adaptation of comic books? Oh, how everything has gone crazy
for the comics! Cinema occupied unsuited cartoon characters of novels.
Some radioactive spider bite, and they are finding a fantastic effect,
soar over the heads of ordinary passers-by. Other masters, almost
single-handedly, an iron suit and give himself the nickname Iron Man,
fighting against terrorism. And, of course, colorful costumes, which,
probably, will soon come into vogue. That we have this season is
popular? Spring-summer season. Please, give me a wetsuit of Kick-Ass
... What? And the costume is a Black Widow? My wife size there?
Hit-girl costume for my daughter ... Save the deal? <br /><br />That&#x27;s the main character, perhaps the most extraordinary, unusual,
shocking, and simply stupid(and maybe still stupid?) Movie in 2010 Dave
Lizevski decided to try onthe role of superhero. Only took to the
streets with a belligerent look and a fanatical desire to do stupid
good as received from some bandits stabbed in the groin. And then it
all and the car was hit. Heroic everyday ... oh. Then you know not to
save the galaxy, huh.<br /><br />Refer to the &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; very seriously you do not get, but stupid movie
just will not name. He is somewhere in the middle between the &#x22;Funny
Games,&#x22; Haneke and easy &#x22;American Pie&#x22;. Picture every now and then goes
from one genre to another, confusing the viewer. In &#xAB;Kick-Ass&#xBB; will be
discussed on the responsibility for his actions, the choice of roles in
his life (who you are pathetic red mist or still Kick-ass?), About the
destination and want to see that all the terms that I now have listed,
never will hear from the mouths of the characters. Do the creators of
tape got to balance between comedy and fierce fighter, but not every
viewer, even with all the incredible flatness of the film, will be able
to perceive the story.<br /><br />The question that defines the film&#x27;s hero Dave Lizevski moron, &#x22;Can
there be a superhero in real life?&#x22; In the movie is not the main. There
are a lot of moral superhero that somehow almost sacrilegious way
sometimes transmitted through toilet humor. In the worst moment of the
film, and did make laugh. And can not help but laugh when Matthew
Vaughn and his team threw a stone in the garden of American culture?
What would have thought Superman before the last moments of my life, do
you think? Why did not I started a family? Why do not I build a house?
Why am I not planted a tree? Why am I this stupid costume and I like
the last idiot circling Empair State Building? Why could not I watch
the last series &#x22;Lost&#x22;? ..<br /><br />Kick This is not complete. He is controversial, unconventional, then
funny, then sad, ultra crazy, ultra violence and sometimes even cute.
Kick your brain, let alone a full &#x22;Kick-ass&#x22; or not, everyone decides
for himself.<br /><br />9 of 10
