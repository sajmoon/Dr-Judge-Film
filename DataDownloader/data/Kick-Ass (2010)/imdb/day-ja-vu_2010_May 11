I got to say I was pleasantly shocked when I saw this movie. So, far it
stands in my opinion, to be one of the best Comic book movies out there
(next to Iron Man).<br /><br />Most comic book based movies always try to over commercialize. Trying
to get the most money by appealing to all ages, as a result having to
be rated G. That&#x27;s what makes Kick Ass special. I really did appreciate
how true to the Comic it was (sister a comic buff as reference). Things
that did differ from the comics only enhanced the movie, and overall
story, for the best. It was dirty, sexual, violent as all hell and you
would be a horrible parent to take your 10 year old to this movie (yes,
parents did to it and walked out 10 mins into it). As a result it was
REAL.<br /><br />Probably one of the best aspects of the movie was majority of the
acting and fight scenes. I will just name my favorites. Chloe Moretz
aka Hit Girl is fu*king brilliant in this movie. Her acting as a 10
year old is so convincing, as well as her sudden bad ass persona as Hit
Girl. She gets tons of props from me for all the physical aspects of
her role. Moretz as Hit Girl has been the best casting I&#x27;ve ever seen
for a superhero. She is honestly the heroine I never got growing up. I
am not a big Nick Cage fan but he played Big Daddy fabulously. His and
Moretz&#x27;s quirky relationship as father and daughter is both endearing
yet powerful. Best father and daughter duo! Christopher Mintz-Plasse
aka Red Mist was loads of laughs and it was nice to see him in a
different role, yet with the same Mintz-Plasse flare. Clark Duke aka
Marty (Kick Asses friend) is hilarious as always, great comic relief, I
would to see more of him in the next film. Surprisingly, Aaron Johnson
aka Kick Ass, hardly made any impact on me as an actor. Yet, he was
passable as Kick Ass, fitting the pathetic sorry persona, but then I
feel that anyone could of played this character. His relationship w/
the character Katie, was funny then got stupid. The rest of the cast
did decent to well enough to carry the story.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed at this movie. The director worked closely
with the creator of the comic to create this movie, which lead to an
astounding outcome. Sure, it didn&#x27;t do that well in Box office for
opening, but that&#x27;s cause it pushed the envelope of most comic movies.
This movie deserves to be watched and recognized cause it&#x27;s pretty bad
ass.
