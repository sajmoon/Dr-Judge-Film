Kick-Ass is a film I have been looking forward to for months now, so
the expectations were great when I went into the theater. I&#x27;ve never
been in a theater performance where the response was so good. People
laughed their asses of, they clapped, they shouted, and it was simply a
fantastic movie experience that I for sure will see several times, both
in the cinema and on DVD. We were with about 100 each in the cinema,
and nobody seemed to have something bad to say about the movie.<br /><br />Neither do I. Kick-Ass is an EPIC superhero movie, and you will have
the that good feeling that you get from movies like this as you exit
the theater. Virtually everything is perfect, both the music, the
humorous undertone, the acting, and I can hardly go any more into
detail before I reveal the too much of the story. The story is also an
amazing adventure, and for those who have not read the comic it is a
good idea to not do so in order to not reveal anything before the
movie. I can say as much as you&#x27;ll be surprised, shocked and annoyed by
things that happen in the film, and whatever expectations you have for
the film; Kick-Ass will meet them, and make you want to see it again. <br /><br />Some of the scenes in the movie is literally STUCK to my brain, and I
cannot wait to see it again!
