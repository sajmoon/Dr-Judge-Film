For the first time in my life do I regret wasting my 2 hours of life on
such a bad movie. The movie has got many flaws. OK to begin with :<br /><br />1)Storytelling:Absolutely boring and predictable. I could predict the
particular twist much before it came <br /><br />2) Action scenes: Absolutely brutal and gory. Besides, I want to ask
the film&#x27;s writers and directors that what were they thinking when they
were making an 11 year old child do all those gruesome acts in spite of
realizing the fact that the movie would be rated R and children would
not be able to see it. <br /><br />3) Sound: Actually the sound effects of this film were the only high
point of this film and this was the fact why I tolerated this film. <br /><br />4) Violence: I am dead against such acts of violence committed by a
child of 11 years of age.I even shudder at the mere fact that what
these violent scenes must had an impact on the simple mind of an 11
year old and what bad effect these abuses might have in a later life.I
fail to fathom the plight of this child. <br /><br />P.S. :- I was taken away by all the high Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb
ratings and decided to see this movie. Please take heed and avoid this
movie AT ALL COSTS !!!!
