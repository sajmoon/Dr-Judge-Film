WOW!!!!!!!!!!! SAW IT on the DVD and it was blitzkrieg. The first
scenes were a little boring but after kick-ass gets his ass-kicked it
gets a whole lot better. hit-girl is great and so is Nicholas Cage as
Big Daddy. Aaron Johnson was great in nowhere boy and loved him even
here specially at last scene where he blasts D&#x27;amico through the window
and the best scene was when hit girl comes and kills the bad guys when
they are about to burn kick ass and big daddy. Even red mist was very
funny, his acting was good and his last line of the film &#x22;Wait,until
they get a load of me&#x22; was a great touch. and his new orange costume
looked great. now i am eagerly waiting for the next part balls to the
walls. hope it is better than the first one and really hope that
hit-girl teaches kick ass some kung fu so he does not get his ass
kicked all the time.
