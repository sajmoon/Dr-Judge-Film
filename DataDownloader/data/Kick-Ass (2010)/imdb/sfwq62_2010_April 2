I went into this film half wary, too many films in recent times have
shown promise of being funny new age epics but fallen so short of the
line. I was in no way disappointed here.<br /><br />The film builds up the main character very well, as a nerdy teen who
just wants to get along, but is constantly hounded by bullies and
embarrassed in social situations. It shows how he hates people for not
getting involved to help others, how people just stand by and how this
motivates him to become a super hero. The film goes great lengths to
connect you with him.<br /><br />Then we have his nemesis introduced as a boy who just wants his fathers
approval and is willing to do anything to get it, and prove himself.
This comes out brilliantly later in the film.<br /><br />Then introduced are Hit Girl and her father Big Daddy, they are
introduced in a way which shows their determination and portrays them
as humorous and bad-ass.<br /><br />All the characters in this film are amazing, and the action pieces keep
you on the edge of your seat and amazed. Plus the use of soundtrack is
almost to perfection here. This is a superhero comedy with deeper moral
themes running underneath with your expected roller coaster of emotions
and kick-assery.<br /><br />Go and see this film!
