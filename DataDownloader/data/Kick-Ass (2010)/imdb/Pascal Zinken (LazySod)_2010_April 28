A guy, as average as averages go, decides to become a vigilante, a
savior in need for damsels in distress. He puts on a suit, practices a
fighting routine and tosses himself into business of superheroes. Not
hampered by any form of experience he is quickly faced with the grim
reality of being a want-to-be-hero, but that doesn&#x27;t stop him. Instead,
it feeds his resolution to become one.<br /><br />As a storyteller this film offers quite enough. It flirts with reality,
in that it never goes so far that it becomes completely impossible
(just very, very improbable) but since it never takes itself seriously
this flirtation only works in a positive way. The story line that ties
the action sequences in this film together is thus more than good
enough.<br /><br />As an action-film this one is solid gold - nice quick paced, neatly
choreographed, sometimes blatantly stolen from other films, but always
fitting to the film.<br /><br />But all that is the basis, and with just that basis this one would
still fall in the category of run-of-the-mill action films. This one
does not do that because it offers extras in the form of some dark and
twisted tangents and it is these extras that make this film very
enjoyable instead of just enjoyable.<br /><br />All in all, nicely over the top, nicely paced, nicely twisted, and
completely mad.<br /><br />9 out of 10 good intentions
