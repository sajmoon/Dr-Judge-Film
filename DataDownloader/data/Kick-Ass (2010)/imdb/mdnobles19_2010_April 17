Kick-Ass should really be called Hit Girl because she pretty much saves
the movie and kind of inspires people around her to be stronger and
badass, she steals every scene. At first I thought that this movie was
a little uneven when it came to balancing laughs and hardcore violence
and some of the jokes worked for me and some didn&#x27;t even put a smirk on
my face and it was pretty childish and over the top for the most part
but everyones inner nerds fantasies are fulfilled and then some. In the
beginning also I really didn&#x27;t buy or take anything seriously in this
film and thought to myself when are you guys going to back up the title
instead of being dorky and strange, then Hit Girl comes and saves the
day. When the ass kicking starts it comes in full and glorious fury
with a action packed finale that was worth the wait and price of
admission and that&#x27;s when it earns it&#x27;s name and my approval of being
Kick-Ass! Overall it&#x27;s very refreshing to see young kids and teenagers
without superhuman powers kicking some major ass and becoming the
mysterious superheroes it&#x27;s almost controversial seeing them shed some
blood and that&#x27;s why I love it even more because it&#x27;s kind of ballsy
but it&#x27;s pretty much a love it or hate it type of film. I say shut up,
get off your ass and see Kick-Ass which will probably be the most fun
time at the movies you&#x27;ll have this year. More of a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!
