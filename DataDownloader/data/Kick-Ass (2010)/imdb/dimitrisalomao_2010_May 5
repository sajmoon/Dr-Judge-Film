The critic Charles Koplinski wrote, &#x22;Kick-Ass is only half right.&#x22;, but
let me put it this way, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is half brilliant, but it&#x27;s half
immoral, and lacks rhythm. When I left the theater I was amazed about
how good this film was, but then I started thinking about how many
immoral messages and lack of depth (Which as OK when the movie didn&#x27;t
take itself too seriously, but then the second part came, and it
started being a real super-hero movie, and, for a few minutes, boring)
that it also contains. But when you see so many ignorant messages in
such acclaimed movies like &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, in this movie industry, that seems
full of stupid people with diluted ideas, it was a relief that in the
end of the movie they didn&#x27;t say &#x22;Save the green!&#x22; or any of that
childish crap.<br /><br />It&#x27;s the story of Dave Lizewski (Johnson), an unnoticed high school
student and comic book fan with a few friends and who lives alone with
his father. His life is not very difficult and his personal trials not
that overwhelming. However, one day he makes the simple decision to
become a super-hero even though he has no powers or training. <br /><br />Right in the first sequences you can see that this movie is different
than the others, probably because of it&#x27;s style (That can be great
sometimes), and narrative technique. The direction is mostly great. The
action scenes and extremely well shot, except for the one where
Hit-Girl use the night vision in the warehouse (It looked more like if
we were watching someone playing &#x22;Doom&#x22;). The violence in this movie is
well put sometimes, but at other times, very disturbing (And i&#x27;m not
easily disturbed).<br /><br />The screenplay is far from being great... Maybe it&#x27;s good, but not
something that improves the movie, on the contrary, it can ruin the
movie if you look in some different points of view, but there is one
thing that it really appreciated about the script... Right in the
beginning we can see how dangerous Frank is, which was not present in
other movies like &#x22;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&#x22; where Andy Garcia (The bad guy)
spends the whole movie without killing a single person. Following the
same grade, is the acting, that is great sometimes (Chloe Moretz, Mark
Strong), sometimes good (Nicholas Cage, Aaron Johnson), and
occasionally bad (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).<br /><br />Another thing that stood out in the picture was that the movie looks
cartoonish, without trying to be it every time, in this aspect, it
works better than &#x22;Sin City&#x22;, but not as good as &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22;.<br /><br />Verdict: Some may find it offensive, and I kind of understand them, but
there is no doubt that this movie is entertaining, well directed and
well acted, and worth watching.
