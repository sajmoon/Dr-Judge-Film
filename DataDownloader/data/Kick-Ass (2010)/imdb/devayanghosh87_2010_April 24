2010_April 24 
when i saw the trailer for this i couldn&#x27;t been happier anymore,it was
my kind of movie,sexually explicit and having raw and brutal action
scenes .It was like KILL BILL meets SUPERBAD and not as dark as
WATCHMEN but i was a little hesitant as Matthew&#x27;s previous movie
STARDUST i didn&#x27;t like a bit.But anyways i went ahead and got the
ticket and it was sheer pleasure for 100 Min&#x27;s or so.There was not a
single dull moment in the movie ,the direction is top notch and the
action is in your mouth.Aaron Johnson was perfect for the role of
troubled teenager.Christopher mintz didn&#x27;t disappoint either,As
expected he played the role of Red Mist properly but the real show
stealer was Chloe moretz aka nindy macready aka hit girl.I was
literally blown by the manner she portrayed such a tough role.KICKASS
is kick ass guys ,i would suggest everyone to go for this movie.It has
become one of my personal favorites and definitely one of the best
movies of 2010
