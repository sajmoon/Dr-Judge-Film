2010_March 25 
I have to say that this film will get some peoples backs up, certainly
the likes of certain media outlets who seem to have an agenda of
stirring up anger and blaming life&#x27;s complex shortfalls and problems on
films as if they can&#x27;t imagine a problem without an answer (or at least
a problem with many different answers) anyway rant over. This film is
absolutely unequivocally the best film I have seen since Inglorius.
It&#x27;s clever, funny, brutal, and geeky sometimes all at the same time.
There are some great in-jokes (Adam west) and some beautiful visuals.
Defo a 9 out of 10 movie for me, I am sure it will find it&#x27;s way into
the IMDb top 250. All I can is just see it for yourself.
