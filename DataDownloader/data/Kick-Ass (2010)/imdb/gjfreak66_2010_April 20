This movie was like a slap in the face...in bed and you like!!!! This
movie is awesome...it has funny characters, and twists to common action
hero themes. It has awesome action scenes, and its violence is not over
done but well placed.<br /><br />Of course it&#x27;s not a movie that is going to get an Oscar nomination,
for it&#x27;s perspective of human interaction or modern day version of the
development of racism, but like any great movie, these characters stay
with you...<br /><br />Its humor is witty and sarcastic, and scene organization and change of
pace keeps the audience consistently wondering..<br /><br />Hit-Girl is one of the most bad ass characters you will see...if
anything see this movie for her.<br /><br />Its great to watch in the theaters because of all the action. and the
humor...you want to watch this movie with a whole bunch of your friends
so you can talk about it later...<br /><br />I expected comedy, some slap stick, a little action...but when you are
watching it, you are thinking, what the hell....this movie is
crazy...when you watch this, get ready for a shot in the
face...literally!!!
