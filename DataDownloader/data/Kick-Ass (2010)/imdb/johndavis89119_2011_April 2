OMG!@ I just watched the movie called Kick-Ass, based on comic book
hero&#x27;s. WOW hooked me in the first 30 seconds and kept me in my seat
the whole time. It was on Cox Communications Epix Chanel 309. If you
haven&#x27;t watched it, definitely check it out. Makes me want more...
ready for an Encore... AWESOME! I couldn&#x27;t leave my seat to get a drink
or go to the bathroom it was that good. Kind of made me wish for a
commercial or at least I wish I had been prepared to sit for the movie
to say the least. Nothing less then brilliant!! A little lag time for
the &#x22;Kickass&#x22; to get into what I had already figured out as .... well I
won&#x27;t tell you don&#x27;t want to spoil it, but he should have shown up just
a little sooner... once you watch it&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking
about. The rescue and final scene. :P Great Flick.
