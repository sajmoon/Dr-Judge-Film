Had to bring my younger brother to a movie and my folks thought Kick
Ass was safe because of the trailer they saw. In the trailer it looks
like it&#x27;s going to be a kids to teen to family movie, I didn&#x27;t want to
go, but it was forced on me. I was very happy I went. Couldn&#x27;t believe
how crude the movie was, it was great! The little 13 year old shocked
the hell out of me. Couldn&#x27;t believe her language. Funny S*%t. Some of
the movie was borderline brutal, definitely not a family movie. Found
it more culty. Not gonna ruin for anybody by giving details but the
movie was a serious, gritty, action packed film, with characters that
at first glance you wouldn&#x27;t expect to be serious, gritty, and actiony
(know it&#x27;s not a word but you guys get it). And thought Cage was great,
he had this ol&#x27; school Adam West thing going on (my pop&#x27;s an avid
batman and star trek ol&#x27; school fool so I&#x27;ve had it around me for quite
some time). But when Cage broke into that mode, I just lost it, and so
did my kid brother from the stuff our pop watches. The trailer I saw
told a different story, not sure why, maybe for shock factor. The movie
definitely rocked.
