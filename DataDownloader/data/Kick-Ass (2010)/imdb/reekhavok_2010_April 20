2010_April 20 
after walking out the cinema and finding myself still laughing for a
good hour (even now) i realised that it was definitely my movie of the
year so far, i know that is quite the statement. The big 3D movies have
been great but kick ass that that raw appeal to it that with the
brilliant action scenes that really make you ooh and aah. combining
them with some cracking laughs and some great acting, Nick Cage brought
it for the first time in a long time, and i felt all the superhero
characters really filled the rolls exactly how i wanted to. Hitgirl in
particular really hit the spot especially after the line &#x22;which one of
you c**ts am i going to kill first?&#x22; i thought maaaaaaate this is going
to be a bumpy ride! i was right, it was... all the way. so go see it on
the big screen as it is one of those movies for sure.
