&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is a film that looks as if the film makers wanted to put
everything into a film that parents would be horrified to have their
kids see or do...and then they marketed it directly to these kids.
Socially irresponsible? Sure...but also quite entertaining. Here is a
brief listing of the things horrified parents will see in the film:
profuse use of the f-word, lots of intense violence, super-heroes who
brutally kill their prey, masturbatory references, brutality that
surprised me, teens having hot and sweaty sex, severed limbs, etc.--all
things kids are clearly told NOT to do and not to see. Yet much of the
time, it IS being done by kids who are teens or even younger. Seeing an
11 year-old using such strong language and eviscerating villains with
reckless abandon IS something you don&#x27;t see every day! <br /><br />While I could analyze the movie or describe its plot, I won&#x27;t, as there
are 16 bazillion reviews for this film already. Instead, I want to
direct this review to parents. While kids really DO talk the way they
do in this movie (as a high school teacher, I know) and the film makers
captured this well, even if you ignore the hard-core language I don&#x27;t
think you should let younger viewers see this film. My 20 year-old
watched it and loved it, but I didn&#x27;t let my soon to be 16
year-old--she is just not as mature as some kids her age. The violence
is just something I think too many teens already are too comfortable
with--and this film will only make this worse. Now if you have an older
teen, then I say let them see it--or, the fact is, they might be old
enough that it really doesn&#x27;t matter what you say. Just be
fore-warned--this is NOT a kids movie or even one for the average
teen--it&#x27;s just too full of stuff they are probably not mature enough
to handle. Heck, I&#x27;m not even sure if I am!<br /><br />Coincidentally, last night I saw a Japanese film that was HIGHLY
reminiscent of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;. &#x22;Lady Snowblood&#x22; is a tale of revenge
concerning a baby who is raised to exact revenge for her parents--one
of the same themes in &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;--and the film is about equally violent
and bloody. If you liked &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, then give this other film a
look--it turned out to be Taratino&#x27;s inspiration for the &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;
series.
