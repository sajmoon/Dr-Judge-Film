Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an unnoticed high school student and
comic book fan who one day decides to become a super-hero, even though
he has no powers, training or meaningful reason to do so.<br /><br />Shortest review I ever wrote: Lyndsy Fonseca was great as Katie
Deauxma, and I would like to see more of her. Clark Duke is already
overexposed (between this film and &#x22;Hot Tub Time Machine&#x22;). Please stop
casting him, he is not the next Jonah Hill.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz is the best young actress in the business today, and while
I already knew that years ago, films like this one and &#x22;Let Me In&#x22; are
proving it. If you need a young actress and Dakota Fanning is too old,
go Chloe Moretz. I do not care what Roger Ebert says about the
violence, this film is great.
