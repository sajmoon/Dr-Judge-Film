This is THE best movie I have seen all year. Its got everything you
could want in a movie! Action, romance, comedy, and violence!! All
rolled into one package. I promise you after you are coming out of the
theatre from seeing this movie, your going to be doing what every one
else thats seen it has been doing: Planning when you can come back to
the theatre and see it again. Its that good. The previews do not do it
justice, its not anything like I expected, and its everything that I
wanted. The cast is genius, each one of them nailing their roles.
Nicholas Cage plays one of the best roles I&#x27;ve ever seen him in. This
is simply a stunning movie, and you owe it to yourself to see it at the
theatre in all its glory. To put it simply, this movie KICKS ASS!
