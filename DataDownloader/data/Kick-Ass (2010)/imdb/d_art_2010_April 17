In this film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a high-schooler who
isn&#x27;t particularly popular or athletic, but loves comics. One day, he
decides to don a superhero costume, name himself &#x22;Kick Ass,&#x22; and fight
crime at night. After few mishaps, he succeeds, and becomes an instant
celebrity. Then, he meets Big Daddy and the 11-year-old Hit Girl,
couple of more capable (and secretive) masked vigilantes, who are
trying to take down the crime boss Frank D&#x27;Amico. He winds up joining
forces with them. Meanwhile, D&#x27;Amico hatches a plan to kill him.<br /><br />The film is directed stylishly by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), based on
a comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The film starts off
like a teen comedy with Dave and his friends talking about girls,
comics, and how there aren&#x27;t any heroes around. I really liked the
premise of the film&#x97;the whole &#x22;what if&#x22; scenario of a normal person
fighting crime in a real world (that is, without all the money that
Bruce Wayne in Batman had), which is probably why I loved the first 30
minutes of it. Once the mafia and other heroes come in, it goes more
into that superhero action movie mode with explosions and other stuff
people pay for.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson plays his role as the geeky Dave with great conviction
and sympathy. His character is heroic not because he is capable, but he
has a heart of a hero. Chloe Moretz plays the 11-year old Hit Girl with
a lot of attitude. There&#x27;s certainly some shock value of a little kid
cussing and vanquishing bad guys, but more on that later. Nicholas Cage
brings a lot of dark humor playing the oddball father role as Big
Daddy.<br /><br />The plot pretty much takes the initial premise and just runs with it,
breaking many rules along the way. There&#x27;s teen angst humor aplenty,
the geek dialogue is a lot of fun, and there&#x27;s occasional dark
violence, which can be a mixed bag. There&#x27;s a certain optimistic
innocence to the character of Dave, which is nice in context of the
story, but the limits of realism of the film&#x27;s world can be rather
unclear. Perhaps it&#x27;s more for sake of realism (or is it?), but the
heroes are allowed to kill people (well, at least the bad guys). I can
imagine Sylvester Stallone from Judge Dredd screaming, &#x22;I&#x27;m not under
the law&#x97;I am the law!&#x22; Traditionally, though, even up to the more
realistic The Dark Knight, killing is the one rule that heroes often
don&#x27;t break&#x97;and they take it more seriously. Given the fact that this
is a comic book movie, or at least a celebration of that genre, it&#x27;s
surprising that it&#x27;s not at least addressed. But, it helps the action,
so it&#x27;s mostly glossed over.<br /><br />The action is fun to look at, quite well-edited, but rather unsettling,
when one thinks about it. I take it the novelty here is seeing an
11-year old girl cussing and ruthlessly gunning down adults (yes,
they&#x27;re still bad guys) in stylistic, over-the-top fashion. I suppose
it works within the context of a comic book movie, yet we see gore and
blood and gunshots rather realistically. Quite a desensitized kid we
have here. Now, imagine if we had a black kid playing this part. There
would be a huge uproar and this film would be amongst the most
controversial movies ever made (never mind that these are still bad
guys getting killed). Of course, we don&#x27;t really believe that a little
girl could ever do that stuff in real life, which is why many are not
as bothered by it. It&#x27;s dismissed as usual comic book silliness (at
least until we see a similar event happening in the news). Call me
sensitive, but it left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />This film, overall, was entertaining, unique, and certainly had no
shortage of style. Some compared this movie to The Dark Knight&#x97;I guess
they must&#x27;ve not liked The Dark Knight as much as I did. The Dark
Knight had a lot more layer and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s works are always
more complex beyond the surface. I also prefer Watchmen and Spider-Man
over this. This film is well-acted, the dialogue is interesting, and I
liked the characters enough to wish they make it to the end. Beyond the
surface, though, the film isn&#x27;t quite as fun as I&#x27;d like it to be. On
occasion, Dave sometimes did feel like second fiddle compared to Hit
Girl and Big Daddy, who are the ones pushing the plot forward. And, of
course, that mixed aftertaste I had.<br /><br />I recall a nice moment in the film where an onlooker at a window
watches a mugging-in-progress, then merely looks away, not even calling
the police&#x97;Dave then points out that average people have become
desensitized about things like justice. I really appreciated that
scene. I wondered what would&#x27;ve happened if the film expanded on that
idea about society? Perhaps he&#x27;ll discover we don&#x27;t really need a
costumed hero in allowing justice to be done. We can all be heroes by
doing the bare minimum of looking out for each other. After all, desire
for justice is one of the reasons we are inspired by superheroes. It
certainly could&#x27;ve been a more interesting, multilayered movie.
Overall, though, ** 1/2 out of **** stars.<br /><br />For more my article updates, you can also follow me on
