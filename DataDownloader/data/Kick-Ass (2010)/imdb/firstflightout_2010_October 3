BEST MOVIE I&#x27;ve seen IN YEARS. Not your typical Super Hero movie like
Batman, Ironman or Superman. 11 year-old Chloe Moretz &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22;
absolutely steals the movie! This is a breakout role for her and you
know you&#x27;re witnessing the birth of an amazingly talented and unique
actress. This film almost never made it to theaters because it was so
radically different that the distributors didn&#x27;t know what to make of
it. Thank God LionsGate recognized it&#x27;s potential and got it out there.
What a wild ride this is! I&#x27;m a long time movie buff and this easily
makes into my top-10 Action Movies of all time. It really does &#x22;KICK
ASS&#x22;!!! The extras on Blu-Ray are well worth watching and show the
enormous talent, attention to detail,and hard work that brought this
movie to life. The music score was top notch. Thanks Matthew Vaughn,
Mark Millar, Cast and Crew. I hope you guys have plans for a sequel!
I&#x27;ll be there.
