2010_April 6 
Already this year, I&#x27;ve see a candidate for not just the best
comic-book film of 2010 but the most entertaining one. <br /><br />Acting: Aaron Johnson, who plays the eponymous Kick-Ass is likable as
an everyday nerd(and pulls off an American accent well - something Sam
Worthington never could even if his life depended on it), Nicholas Cage
delivers his lines with an intentional deadpan, soap-opera staccato
that&#x27;s quite humorous in places, Mark Strong(who seems to be
continuously cast as villains) is really good and brutal as a drug
lord, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is amusing as Red Mist, with a
high-pitched voice but the person that steals the scenes is Hit Girl. <br /><br />Chlo&#xEB; Moretz plays her character as a precocious, resourceful,
foul-mouthed (when she niftily dispatching her victims) and basically a
kid assassin with attitude. Her incongruous behaviour(for her age)
stems from this being a comic-book film, so she&#x27;s wholly from a skewed
version of reality, therefore should not cause any offence to informed
individuals who understand this.<br /><br />Plot: There is a clear homage to Spider-Man here, plot-wise, but it&#x27;s
subversive in how it plays out, despite the familiar elements. It also
works on different levels: a social commentary(on passive bystanders of
crime), instant celebrity, responsibility, vengeance and as a
entertaining action comedy. There&#x27;s all sorts of in-jokes with
references to comic-books here (as well as telly, film and video
games), with a very tongue in cheek tone(with even serious scenes
having some laughs from characters making amusing comments). I would&#x27;ve
liked to see scenes where characters suffered the consequences of being
injured more, but to a certain extent, it&#x27;s cartoony style(that doesn&#x27;t
linger too long on bloody violence) works for it&#x27;s tone it&#x27;s going for. <br /><br />Cinematography and SFX: A colourfully pleasing look, with a dynamic,
fast-paced style of choreographed violence that is rapidly edited and
focuses more on the inventive skill of the heroes. I loved the
3D-looking animated comic book strip.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a video-game inspired action (FPS influenced in one scene in
particular) that are easier to follow than any Bay-directed action
sequence. Those prone to photosensitive epilepsy should note a brief
strobe lighting sequence. <br /><br />Score: The title song by Mika is an empowering, catchy pop song that
captures the drive of the masked vigilantes in the film. Others songs
used fittingly to create the right tone this film&#x27;s going for - lively
and no-nonsense. The score uses recognisable tracks from Sunshine and
28 Days Later.<br /><br />Overall: Like giving the middle-finger to conformity, Kick-Ass wears
it&#x27;s punk rock tone proudly, and addresses the dangers of playing dress
up to fight crime while acknowledging the reasons such people could
have for doing so. While I&#x27;m not inspired to become a masked vigilante
anytime soon(the occupational hazard is just too high :D), I was very
entertained by this and surprisingly even my middle-aged Mum(who the
Daily Mail though would be enraged by such rebellion) loved it. A cool,
moderately humorous experience indeed and a definite must-see at a
cinema near you as it does exactly what it says on the tin and delivers
it with panache - 7.5/10
