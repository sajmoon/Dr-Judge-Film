I can see how &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is gonna be popular...but, then, I can see how
&#x22;Transformers 2&#x22; could be popular, too. Now that that&#x27;s out of the
way...<br /><br />If you&#x27;re someone who thinks it might be a lark to watch an 11-year-old
corner a defenceless woman and stab her twice through the chest, this
movie might be for you. There&#x27;s also a scene where she puts a guy in a
trash compactor and we watch for a couple minutes as he&#x27;s squished to
death. The guy wasn&#x27;t a character before this scene (and I don&#x27;t
remember what relevance he has to the movie), so we&#x27;re not watching the
payoff to a joke, we&#x27;re just watching...a guy getting squished by a
trash compactor. The brutality of the scene is immediately undercut
with the 11-year-old employing some nasty profanity, an easy joke
that&#x27;ll get an immediate reaction, doing away with the conflict I
imagine (hope?) a lot of the audience will be feeling after the scene
that preceded it.<br /><br />The premise is: real people trying to be super-heroes (not a bad idea -
I liked it in &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;). Dave is a comic book geek modelled, I
assume, on most of the movie&#x27;s target audience. He actually bears a
closer resemblance to a Michael Cera hero, but, I&#x27;ll get to that later.
Anyway, he likes comic books, he decides to start &#x22;fighting crime&#x22;
(which is always just around the corner in these movies) so he orders a
suit and goes at it. He&#x27;s not very good, and his friends make fun of
him for the idea.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an ex-cop (Nicolas Cage - very good) is turning his young
daughter (the 11-year-old) into a cold-blooded killer, for our benefit.
They&#x27;re playing out a revenge scheme against the movie&#x27;s chief villain,
a mob boss played by Mark Strong. The plot in this movie sometimes
feels like math: setup + action = payoff. Actually, that&#x27;s exactly what
it feels like. It&#x27;s supposed satire is constantly undercut by its rigid
obedience to its own formula. Since we can already guess, roughly, how
everything will play out, I don&#x27;t know why &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; spends so much
time explaining itself.<br /><br />When you hear the premise - real people trying to be superheroes - it
sounds good, but watching this movie makes you think there are really
only a few ways to handle it. There&#x27;s &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; or &#x22;Iron Man&#x22;
way, which is, more or less, taking it seriously. Or you could go for a
satirical/darkly comic tone, which this movie tries for. If you were to
do that, the best way to handle the violence would be to make it
convincing, wouldn&#x27;t it? Since, as the movie opens, it seems to make
itself very clear that it doesn&#x27;t take place in some phony superhero
world? Instead, people get shot, they fall dead and CGI blood squirts
out. You&#x27;ve seen one guy squirt CGI blood, you&#x27;ve seen &#x27;em all - and it
happens over and over again. The violence in this movie packs no punch,
it&#x27;s thoughtless and, supposedly, fun!, which makes it all the more
disheartening when it&#x27;s directed at the defenceless woman.<br /><br />So it wasn&#x27;t a very pleasant experience for me. Shift it an inch one
way and you could&#x27;ve had a nice dark comedy (something by the Coens).
An inch the other way you could&#x27;ve had a clever action movie (Crank &#x26;
Crank 2). &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is like a cautious kid, skirting the deep end
without having the nerve to stick his toes in the water. It&#x27;s not
ballsy enough to take the father/daughter relationship to the logical,
risky conclusion that it demands. It&#x27;s not smart enough to question the
motives of its boring protagonist - he&#x27;s, basically, good (and he gets
the girl). It&#x27;s not original enough to offer us any &#x22;evil&#x22; that&#x27;s not
the cartoon kind we&#x27;ve already been tired of seeing in thousands of
others movies. It&#x27;s sense of humour is on the level of a disturbed
child who likes to use swear words - which is one of its favourite
jokes.<br /><br />I said the movie&#x27;s about real people trying to be superheroes. Not
quite. It&#x27;s about the &#x22;real people&#x22; you see in Hollywood movies,
becoming superheroes. The &#x22;real people&#x22; played by Michael Cera or Shia
LaBoef or Miley Cyrus. The ones who live in a glossy, safe world where
they get what they want in the end. In this case, it&#x27;s to have sex and
kill a bunch of people. That could make for a great joke, except that,
like those glossy Hollywood movies, it doesn&#x27;t have the confidence to
get you to actually think about it.<br /><br />4/10 (Three points Nicolas Cage, one point Clark Duke. Otherwise,
zilch.)
