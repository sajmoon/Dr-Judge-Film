This movie was F&#x27;n magnificent. It was more than that. The plot, it&#x27;s
not as simple as some people may think. Matter of fact I will not give
any idea about what&#x27;s going on but I will say the screenplay was simply
great... Things you will like about kick-ass besides the plot, is the
dialogue which is funny and intelligently built, you will love the
action scenes which are pretty awesome made and the delivery of this
superhero satire. It&#x27;s funny, It&#x27;s hilarious, it&#x27;s creative, it&#x27;s not
clicheic and definitely it deserves the appreciation.<br /><br />The movie was edited very well and the cinematography used in this
movie gave it a big personality. You would see a lot of scenes taken
from different action movies not only superhero ones just to mention
some: &#x22;28 Months Later&#x22;, &#x22;Smokin&#x22; Aces&#x22;, &#x22;Bourne Identity&#x22;, &#x22;Scarface&#x22;
or &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;. Isn&#x27;t that awesomely weird? The acting in this movie
was great for this type, I really felt the vibe, I mean, I really liked
Cage in this movie though he looked a lot like Harvey (The Lovely
Bones) portrayed by Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />The score used for this movie was HUGE! I mean you had the &#x22;28 Months
Later&#x22; version remade, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; score by Hans Zimmer remade,
and a lot of other movies but I mention only these just to give you an
info on how good this movie actually is.<br /><br />Things you may find disturbing: 1. The violence which is unexpectedly
big.<br /><br />2. The language used especially from an 11-12 years old girl.<br /><br />Other than that... this is way more fun and intense than a lot of these
movies coming out from Hollywood these days.
