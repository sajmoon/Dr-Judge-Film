Many other reviews will tell you why the movie is great. I personally
disliked the movie, so this review will focus on why.<br /><br />The plot is fun and promising, and the film contains several nice
action shots. Apart from some lame adolescent fake and gay jokes, it&#x27;s
fun to watch, but...<br /><br />My main problem, as I also had when watching &#x22;Watchmen&#x22; for instance,
was the extreme and sometimes gratuitous violence using slow-mo and fun
music, as if what we were seeing on the screen were no big deal. This
movie goes as far as to use a 12 year-old girl chopping up guys with a
sword and using foul language all the way through (&#x22;cunt&#x22;, &#x22;fuck you&#x22;,
etc.), with manga-like music in the background. This all feels like the
millionth remake of Kill Bill, which I also disliked by the way, for
the same reason : how can killing people be described and pictured as
an art form ? It just shows how comfortable people have become with
watching horrific stuff and not be bothered by it at all. Well, this
kind of movie bothers me!
