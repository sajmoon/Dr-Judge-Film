I went to see this afternoon and wow this kicked ass!! It was
fantastic. It was fast, funny and very entertaining. The pace of the
film was spot on, i was never once looking at my watch/phone, I was
glued. The comedy was spot it, it was so funny. The kids in the film,
to be fair there is only the girl i would say qualified as a child but
they were fantastic, what a great set of young actors and the young
girl she was spot on too, I loved her. Nick Cage as always was great as
the dad. I cant say anything wrong about this film at all. I enjoyed it
so much. Yeah there is a lot of violence and swearing so if your
offended then stay away. But it isn&#x27;t misplaced and fits in well with
the film both in a serious and comical way. The final scene when kick
ass really does kick ass is just thrilling and I do hope the way they
left this means there will be a well written and put together sequel, a
film as well written and put together as this. I really want to be a
superhero, if kick ass can do it, so can I.
