In New York, the teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a loser
high-school student fan of comic books ignored in school that spends
most of his time with his friends Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan
Peters) that are also comic book fans. Dave has a great attraction by
Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) that does not notice him. One day, the
clumsy Dave decides to make the difference becoming a masked superhero
without powers named Kick-Ass. However in his first action avoiding a
car to be stolen by two punks, he is stabbed by one of them and hit by
a car later. Dave is submitted to a surgery and his bones are mended
with metal. When he recovers, Katie notices him believing that Dave is
gay. In the night, Dave helps a man that is hunted down by three guys
in front of a cafeteria and the teenagers shoot the fight with their
cell phones and cameras. Then they put the footage in Internet and
Kick-Ass immediately becomes famous. Meanwhile the powerful gangster
Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong) believes that Kick-Ass is responsible for
actions against his gang and plots a scheme to destroy him. However,
the responsible are the vigilantes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, whose secret
identities are Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and his daughter Mindy
(Chloe Moretz). Damon is an ex-cop that was framed by Frank D&#x27;Amico and
sentenced to prison. He lost his beloved wife while imprisoned and
trained his daughter in fights and weapons to combat crime, more
specifically Frank. They start a partnership with Kick-Ass, but sooner
the evil Frank and his son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) plot a plan
to betray Kick-Ass.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is one of the funniest movies I have watched this year,
exploring pop culture of comic books, superheroes and video-games
associated with silliness to the best. The cartoonish characters are
hilarious, with a deucebag that has his ass frequently kicked deciding
to become a hero that kick asses; an eleven year-old girl that is a
hit-woman (actually a hit-girl); a paranoid father that raises his
daughter training her to kill bad guys; a beautiful girl that gets
closer to the anti-hero Dave just because she believes he is gay.
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is a great parody to Spider-man and I loved the reference
&#x22;with no power comes no responsibility&#x22;. Chloe Moretz performs one of
the most refreshing and crazy characters with Hit-Girl that looks like
Steven Seagal or any other action movie hero like Chuck Norris, Bruce
Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dolph
Lundgren expert in martial arts and weapons that easily kill the bad
guys and is responsible for some of the best moments of this
entertaining film. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
