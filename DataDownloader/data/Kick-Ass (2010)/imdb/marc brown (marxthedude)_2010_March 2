In a movie industry cluttered with own-grown hype, gimmicks and lack of
idea, &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; bursts onto the screen and shatters all expectations
in it&#x27;s wake. You&#x27;re on this page because you think it&#x27;s gonna be good?
Wrong. Or you&#x27;re here because you think it looks a decent or a good
superhero movie to join the ranks of the ones you already love? DEAD
wrong. Reason being, is &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22;doesn&#x27;t want to be good or above
average, &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; wants to be great and it has the balls to want to
be original too. Seemingly impossible in a done to death genre where
we&#x27;ve already glimpsed Mark Millar&#x27;s signature style in &#x22;Wanted&#x22;, but
&#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is all about the unexpected.<br /><br />Make no mistake, nothing you believe of this movie compares to what
Vaughn and co. serve up for you. Mainly because everyone involved seems
determined to honour the comic and redefine a genre. Most movies
entertain, but this one? It wants to BLOW YOU AWAY! Less smarter movies
have done that but &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; ain&#x27;t giving that up either. It&#x27;s script
is razor-sharp, dumping the pretension of &#x22;the burden of heroism&#x22;
crippling even the better superhero films, showing this in actions
rather than long drawn out emoting. Matthew Vaughn has finally solved
the hurdle that all superhero movies suffer, namely how to get to know
and love your characters without long drawn out scenes. He does it by
keeping them moving. The more they do, the more they try, the more you
know and love them. And make the narrative interesting and most of all
relatable so we&#x27;re with Dave 100% of the way, it doesn&#x27;t just have to
functional.<br /><br />The real visual joy of &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is it&#x27;s desire to keep it simple but
not at the expense of wowing us. Make characters do cool things,
instead of Michael Bay-esquire things happening to them. That&#x27;s why
they exude coolness, despite Dave&#x27;s almost humdrum existence. This is
the everyman doing the things we could do if wanted to; not a guy from
another reality or possessed with great drive and ambition. Dave wants
to get laid. He wants to be hip. Even your bad guy in this is
believable. Watching the whirlwind that is Hit Girl perform a routine
almost straight out of Jackie Chan&#x27;s Hong Kong days stuns us in a way
no big screen chase ever could. Visually the film takes all the thing
we DID love from the movies that ultimately didn&#x27;t zing and churns them
into a finely balanced flawless brew.<br /><br />Did I mention it&#x27;s feel good? From it&#x27;s inspired use of music (again
utterly relatable) right down to it&#x27;s outstanding score, like &#x22;Get
Carter&#x22; for superheroes; I could say more but there&#x27;s surprises in
store.<br /><br />In a movie this stunning, acting is usually secondary (as any James
Cameron film shows). Not a bit of it. In a cast as eclectic as the
styles the film embraces you have performances that set a benchmark for
all concerned. Can Mark Strong already better his stellar work? See his
menacing and humorous turn as D&#x27;Amico, a career best. Christopher Mintz
Plasse follows &#x22;Role Models&#x22; by breaking out of McLovin mode. His guy
has layers and he can show them. Nicolas Cage as expected returns to
his past glories playing larger than life eccentric characters but not
without a little sadness too. Joining him is Chloe Moretz forever
destined to be remembered for her first major role. She idolised
Angelina Jolie apparently. Guess what, you trounced any action movie
she has ever made! Moretz dominates any scenes she&#x27;s in, no easy task
considering her fellow cast! Aaron Johnson has the most difficult job
of all. Being an original uber-geek after Michael Cera set the standard
(anyone who&#x27;s seen &#x22;Zombieland&#x22; knows it&#x27;s hard to write an original
geek even in a great movie). He shakes it, redefines it and OWNS it. He
leads the movie like he wrote it, joined by a cast where even the
smallest roles are fully fleshed out. It&#x27;s quite an ensemble. A
renegade band of acting styles forming a perfect one and complementing
the film&#x27;s fun style.<br /><br />Watching &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; is ultimately like being on a thrill-ride, it
doesn&#x27;t just want to dazzle you, it&#x27;s wants to draw you in, ride the
wave and leave the cinema on a high. And it doesn&#x27;t do that with
gimmicks or tried and tested formula&#x27;s, it breaks the mold, shakes
conventions and wants you to be surprised while complementing all the
movies you already love. It&#x27;s not just a movie, it&#x27;s a standard, one
that promises to prove movies like this can be written with great heart
and brain.<br /><br />And ultimately you&#x27;ll be leaving the screen thinking &#x22;Wow, let&#x27;s do
that again&#x22; no matter how many agains come before it.
