spider-man / super-man... take a break... here cometh Kick-Ass
brilliant movie with superb action sequences and an amazing performance
by Nicholas Cage (Big Daddy) Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) had his share of
great acting too The script was very impressive... this is a kind of
flick you sit and watch and wonder what the heck is gonna happen in the
next 10 seconds... kept me at the edge of the seat throughout...<br /><br />the real star with a very promising performance yet was that of Chloe
Moretz (Hit Girl).. wonder where did little girl came from... this was
the second time i saw Chloe (the first being 500 days of Summer) and
God she&#x27;s grown into a great actor... <br /><br />eagerly waiting for the sequel... to see some more ass kicked
