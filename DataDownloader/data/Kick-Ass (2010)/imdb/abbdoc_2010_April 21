Yes readers, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, after
reading all the hype and comment here (which lets face it we take with
a pinch of salt) I decided to go see this movie and haven&#x27;t laughed as
much since Borat.<br /><br />Yes I must admit to being a wee bit shocked when the 11 Yr old uttered
the now famous( or infamous) line but had to do a second take and turn
to my viewing partners and ask what did she just say? Anyways, go see
this movie it is IMHO one of the best you will see this year, its got a
bit of everything for everyone and the people that criticise it, well
fair enough, but don&#x27;t do a Life of Brian and criticise without seeing
it?? Regards to all
