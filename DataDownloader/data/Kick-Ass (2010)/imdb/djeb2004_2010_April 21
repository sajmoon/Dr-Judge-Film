2010_April 21 
Well I went and saw this movie opening night on our local mega screen.
I was happy that I did and this movie was worth the money. The acting
was excellent. I was very surprised with &#x22;hit girl&#x22; performance. Some
of the things you see are a little out there but well done none the
less. The plot actually had some meaning and depth and turned into
quite a serious movie. Nicholas Cage doesn&#x27;t share too much screen time
but when he does it is quite memorable. The music and atmosphere would
get intense at times which gave the movie more props. If you watched
the trailer you are getting something more than you would expect as
that is all I have seen and knew nothing else about it. It contained a
lot of teen humor and adult humor. The action sequences and gun fights
were excellent. There were only a few moments in the movie where I
thought &#x22;ok now this would never happen&#x22; but it didn&#x27;t take away too
much from my viewing pleasure. I am giving this movie an 8/10 simply
because it started this summer out excellent with more great movies to
come this year and if you in the mood for fun, laughter, and action,
and Mclovin! Then this is your movie.
