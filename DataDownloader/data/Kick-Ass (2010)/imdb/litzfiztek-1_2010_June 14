I usually don&#x27;t review movies I don&#x27;t like. I had high expectations,
the story of an ordinary guy being a superhero and all, it was what
attracted me to the movie. But finally i did end up watching a lame
revenge movie. A typical movie trying to attract the average audience
with the regular &#x27;THE HERO IS A GEEK, THEN HE TURNS COOL AND GETS HIS
GIRL&#x27; story. It was my fault to have expectations for this movie to be
at least even close to be half as funny as Superbad. It didn&#x27;t even
make me grin. There are lots of noobs that like this movie and have
given it a radically cool rating of over 8. But then again don&#x27;t watch
it because it has a good rating in IMDb. The movie is utter crap with
nonsensical and predictable plot with worst pair of actors the
directors could come up with. Except Christopher mintz - That guy can
act from whatever i have seen of him, he shouldn&#x27;t have chosen to do
this movie.
