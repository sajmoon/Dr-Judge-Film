When I went to see Kick Ass I was already to hate it. I had read the
comic book before I went to see the movie and I hated it. It was the
meanest thing I ever read and I would not recommend it even to the
meanest of people. However I enjoyed the film and it&#x27;s a special
occasion when the film is better than it&#x27;s source material.<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t know the story it&#x27;s all about a 16 year old comic nerd who
becomes a superhero Kick Ass called and fights crime. There&#x27;s also a
subplot involving an ex cop played by Nicolas Cage who wants to get
revenge on a mob boss. He has the help of his 11 year old daughter
Mindy and together they both become the superheros Big Daddy and Hit
Girl. Matthew Vaughn who would later direct X men First Class and does
a damm fine job of directing a much more nerdy and if you put it a
rubbish superhero. The performances are also very good especially
Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz who plays Hit Girl as I think there
relationship if you put is really sweet.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not for everyone as there is a lot of violence and swearing. Trust
me there&#x27;s not nearly as much swearing as there was in the comic.
There&#x27;s not as much violence in the film as there is in the comic
although the violence in the film is much more disturbing and very
unnesscery.<br /><br />Overall the movie&#x27;s good but not for everyone and trust me if you&#x27;re
gonna either see the movie or the comic see the movie.
