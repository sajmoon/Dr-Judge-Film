The whole concept of the film was pretty interesting, but the writing
for it was not that good. The story was pretty uneventful or in lament
terms; stupid. Plus the fact they set the movie up to be non stop
fighting and there really wasn&#x27;t that much. So all you could ask for
was the action to make up for it. Some of it did, but not really. Here
is why I liked the movie though. I love the cast, a few scenes really
did &#x22;kick ass&#x22; and the story did have potential even though it was not
done right. I guess I couldn&#x27;t help but like the film even though there
were so many things wrong. The best cast member was Chloe Moretz. Her
acting and fighting was so great, they could make a movie just about
her. Aaron Johnson was decent as the main character. He is mostly a
nerd who really couldn&#x27;t fight. Then you have the villain who is
Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He was pretty funny. Now Nicolas Cage was
just OK and there is one scene that was so stupid I wanted to punch
Cage in the face and say, &#x22;why did you agree to this?&#x22; So overall this
is an interesting movie. I am sure they will make more and I think it
has potential to do better. Just have to wait and see.
