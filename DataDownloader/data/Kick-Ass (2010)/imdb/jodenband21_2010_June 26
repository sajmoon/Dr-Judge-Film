I had planned to watch this film on Friday, since there were no class
on Saturday.<br /><br />The film started to Dave Lizewski as his alter-ego Kick-Ass. Normally
he&#x27;s a teenage boy obsessed in comic books and all the superheroes, and
planning to be one of them. How could possibly he can become a
superhero and a bad-ass without powers? This film has the humor, and
the action that all the ages would demand.<br /><br />Few of the characters that are played successfully are Chloe Moretz and
Nicolas Cage&#x27;s character as Hit Girl and Big Daddy. My brother and I
laughed and buckled in our seats since this film rocks.<br /><br />10/10
