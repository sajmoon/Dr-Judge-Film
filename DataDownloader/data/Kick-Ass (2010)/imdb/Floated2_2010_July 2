I got the chance to see this movie last night (07/01/10&#x27;) on DVD and it
was great. I heard many great reviews and some mixed reviews but its a
great movie. People need to stop talking movies too seriously and enjoy
it for what it is. Granted, its not a movie for everyone, and not
everyone would like it but people need to give it a try and quit at it
if they dislike it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s rare when a movie is seemed better than the trailer and this movie
is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people&#x27;s
opinion, on how this isn&#x27;t a plausible superhero movie, and more of a
wannabe superhero&#x27;s fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is
overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so
entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best
wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero
movies. This movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch
because unlike PG-13 movies, this movie goes all out. They don&#x27;t hold
back on the action and violence, and that is one of the reasons why
this movie was successful. I am glad the distributors decided not to
dumb this movie down for the younger audiences. Nicolas Cage did a
great job with his role as well but unlucky for him, he character dies
towards the end. His daughter, Hit-Girl really stole the show in this
movie and she was definitely the main character towards the end of the
movie. It was intense and amazing!
