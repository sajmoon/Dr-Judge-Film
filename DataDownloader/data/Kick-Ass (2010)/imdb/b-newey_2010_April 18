OK for all of you out there that just read Tom Collins review don&#x27;t
listen to the part about Avatar. You can&#x27;t compare an Action/Comedy to
a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Adventure. Thats just wrong on so many levels. So
please Tom stop putting your opinion out there that isn&#x27;t even an
opinion at all. <br /><br />In other news: this movie was really good and I would recommend it to
all but the 12 year old sitting a row down from me. It actually has a
really good story and you&#x27;ll probably be surprised throughout the whole
thing. It has great constant action, a love interest, some drama and
the best part is that all of these things are in good balance. The only
thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the potential awkwardness at some parts in
this movie. Once you see it you will know what I mean but it is like a
pebble in an ocean. You will hardly notice this film&#x27;s faults. <br /><br />Bottom Line: Don&#x27;t think about how good Avatar is compared to this
movie. Just go and see it, have a good laugh and be emotionally
impacted at the same time and hopefully come out happy that you just
spent $10 on that. <br /><br />B. N.
