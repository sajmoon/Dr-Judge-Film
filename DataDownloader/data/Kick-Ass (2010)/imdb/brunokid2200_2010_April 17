I had my doubts about Kick-Ass after seeing the trailers. It seemed
like just another typical teenager/sex comedy. Yes, the movie does
contain humor that could fit in to that category, but this movie was
more than that. Kick-Ass starts with a very comedic tone and suddenly
fades in to an in-your-face action film which..kicks ass. First off,
this movie is NOT a child-friendly film. It contains extremely graphic
violence mostly involving the 11 year old, Hit-Girl. The storyline of
this movie grabs you from the beginning. It follows a story of revenge
involving Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. This movie is very funny but overall,
a solid action film. This kills are crazy, the tone is just so
hardcore, and the laughs keep coming throughout the whole film. This
movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys action, comedy, and drama.
Overall: fantastic movie.
