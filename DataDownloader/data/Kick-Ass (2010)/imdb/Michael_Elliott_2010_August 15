Kick-Ass (2010)<br /><br />*** (out of 4) <br /><br />Dave (Aaron Johnson) is a loser in high school that does nothing but
read comics, hang out with his loser friends and that&#x27;s pretty much it
as he couldn&#x27;t get a girl to look at him even if he had money. One day
he gets the bright idea to become a superhero but of course he doesn&#x27;t
have any special powers but his alter ego Kick-Ass hits the streets
where he going to get beat to a pulp but soon a father (Nicolas Cage)
and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) show up to lend a hand in bringing down
a gangster. If you take this movie very serious then you&#x27;re probably
going to end up hating it like Roger Ebert did. I really can&#x27;t blame
anyone for not wanting to watch an 11-year-old girl kill multiple
people and getting beaten to a pulp. Seeing kids killing or being
abused isn&#x27;t very entertaining but there&#x27;s just something so weird,
surreal and rather original about this movie that it works somehow. I
personally can&#x27;t think of another movie like this one and that&#x27;s
something hard to find and that reason alone makes this a must-see as
long as you can put up with the subject matter. I think what makes the
film work so well is that it really does take place in a real world
where our &#x22;heroes&#x22; wear the funny costumes but they don&#x27;t contain any
super human strength or special powers. As much as one can enjoy comic
book movies it&#x27;s always common sense that you&#x27;re watching something
fake. That fakeness is pretty much taken away here and we&#x27;re left with
a rather realistic movie that manages to work because of how natural it
is. I loved the scenes early on when Kick-Ass first goes out to clean
up the streets only to get his head bashed in and nearly lose his life
because he&#x27;s simply not tough. It gets even better when the kids soon
begins to build his strength as he finally gets the girl of his dreams
only because there&#x27;s a rumor going around school that he&#x27;s gay and she
wants a gay best friend. Even funnier is a few earlier scenes where
Dave, soon to be Kick-Ass, talks about his pathetic life, which is
nothing more than comics and looking at porn. All of these scenes come
off very realistic and I thought the movie did a great job at making
sure the characters here were humans first of all. It&#x27;s the human
aspect of their actions that makes the story work and without this
you&#x27;d be left with something not nearly as impressive. I really enjoyed
Johnson in the lead role and thought he made a very believable dork as
well as a believable action hero. Moretz and her dirty mouth clearly
steal the film as she also gets the best costume of all our heroes.
Cage doesn&#x27;t go as over-the-top as you&#x27;d expect but it&#x27;s fun seeing an
actor of his type in this kind of movie. I&#x27;m sure a long article could
be written about an 11-year-old girl who kills without feelings and one
whose father taught her to kill but I think that would be missing the
point of the film. This wasn&#x27;t meant to be any psychological drama
about kids and violence so if you&#x27;re unwilling to laugh then it&#x27;s
probably best that you skip this film. For me, the images were rather
dark but at the same time they were rather playful, real and most
importantly they were funny.
