Well, i was expecting some kind of a comic hero parody like super hero
movie, or along those lines. Which is decently good, but my god, i was
totally wrong.<br /><br />Kick ass is something totally unexpected, and its very hard to
describe. Its a light comedy, yet it has a lot of insane violence, you
see people getting shot in the head, members going off the body, knives
going trough hands, insane amounts of gunshots. How that mix of genres
worked out?. Apparently very easy. Being original.<br /><br />The soundtrack will subtly drag you inside the movie, the plot its
great, the cast couldn&#x27;t be better, they are all very likable and
convincing, specially Hit girl, i never saw something like that, the
action secuences look like taken out from kill bill, blade, the dark
knight and jackie chan movies.<br /><br />I hope this give you a vague idea about the movie. But one thing is for
sure, it will blow your mind.
