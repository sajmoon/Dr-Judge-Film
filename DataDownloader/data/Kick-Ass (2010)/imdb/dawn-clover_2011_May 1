I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of super hero movies. I&#x27;ve enjoyed
Spider-Man (the first two), and one or two Superman movies, but I&#x27;ve
never been too much into them.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is not your usual super hero movie. Actually, the main
character can&#x27;t even be called a real super hero. A hero? Sure! But
there&#x27;s nothing super about him, it&#x27;s not like he can climb walls, fly
or has inhuman strength. He&#x27;s pretty good at getting the crap beaten
out of him though! But kicking some ass as well!<br /><br />The plot is fun to follow, and the actors give some very good
interpretations. The action is awesome, especially scenes involving Hit
Girl - seriously, a young girl kicking so much ass and spreading so
much blood, this probably had some people very ticked off... which I
see as a good thing!<br /><br />Photography is pretty good, the color palette of the movie is colorful
and often gritty, giving it a rough comic book style look. Which, of
course, fits the movie like a glove. <br /><br />The music is great! Some epic, climatic moments that accompany the
scenes flawlessly and leave them even more engaging!<br /><br />Overall, if you&#x27;re a fan of action / comedy movies and/or super hero
movies, you must watch this movie.<br /><br />8 out of 10.
