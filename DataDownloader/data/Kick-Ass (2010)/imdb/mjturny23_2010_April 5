This is an almost perfect movie (I say &#x27;almost&#x27; only because I don&#x27;t
believe there could ever be a perfect movie).<br /><br />Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are the Batman and Robin analogy of your dreams
with Big Daddy&#x27;s - at first strange, then very captivating - take on
Adam West, and the very human and complex relationship they share.<br /><br />But then all the performances are dead on, and everyone involved really
seems to know their comic book stuff while making this movie very
accessible to everyone. I feel sorry for the Iron Man franchise, it&#x27;s
great but it was beat by The Dark Knight, and now Kick-Ass.<br /><br />This genuinely feels like how it would be if superheroes existed in the
real world, but with much awesomeness. A touching, exciting, extremely
well made film that surprises you with every turn. My favourite film of
the year. Kick-Ass.
