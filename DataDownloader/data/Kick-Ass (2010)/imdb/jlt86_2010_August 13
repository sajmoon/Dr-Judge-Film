At first, when I saw the previews for Kick Ass, it didn&#x27;t really look
all that interesting...until I saw why it received an R rating. This
movie was SO much better than what I thought it would be. The important
thing to keep in mind is, don&#x27;t take it TOO seriously and don&#x27;t take it
TOO personally. People complain about 11 year old Hit Girl having a
filthy mouth, a high body count, and bloody murderous fight
scenes...but seriously people, GET OVER IT. You see what it&#x27;s rated R
for so it goes without saying that Kick Ass is not for
everyone...particularly those that get sick at the sight of blood. If
you think a movie is going to be offensive to you...don&#x27;t watch
it...and therefore you won&#x27;t have to bitch about it later.<br /><br />Kick Ass is bloody good fun, stylish, fast paced and not for the feint
of heart. If you&#x27;re not easily offended (or have a stick wedged up your
ass) you&#x27;re in for a good time.
