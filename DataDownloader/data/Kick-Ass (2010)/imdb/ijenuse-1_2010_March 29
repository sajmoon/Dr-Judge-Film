There is a line where Johnson&#x27;s Kickass compares his need for action
after fantasising for a long time with that of a serial killer. The
film shares pretty much the same attitude; unconventional in it&#x27;s
attribution to the more cosmic superhero flicks and dethroning the s**t
out of them to claim an entirely unexpected yet commanding fan
following. If you think this is an exaggeration, u obviously are alien
to the internet.<br /><br />Saw this at Cineworld Haymarket in London at a preview screening. Had
heard great reviews about it and was sceptical it may not match my high
expectations which has been not infrequent in the past. But Kickass was
FUN!!! right from the shrewd opening scene to the super violent
culmination, the movie was just one great ride. Clich&#xE9;s are over turned
on its head and given new dimensions. Like the inevitable love angle,
mental trauma of the superhero- his constant struggle with his
alter-ego and the society&#x27;s take on his avatar- everything is like
nothing you have seen before.<br /><br />Performances in a superhero flick tend to be incredibly wooden unless a
genius like Nolan is at the helm. Without making any comparisons, its
safe to say Mathew Vaughn knows how to mold his actors into the
characters he has envisaged. Aaron Johnson is confident and quite
perfect as kick-ass with the right amount of vulnerability on show. His
American accent is perfect. Nic Cage makes a welcome comeback in a
small but well written role. Mintz Plasse is competent and is getting
there. It&#x27;s always great to see the super cool Mark Strong and he is
brilliant in this too. But as you expected sweet and cuddly Chloe
Moretz steals the the thunder and makes Hit Girl an iconic pop cultural
phenomenon. The foul mouthed ultra violent 11 year old may have your
granny fuming at her real life parents but she is sure to have created
an indelible stamp on your mind you will just sympathise with poor
granny for not having nearly as much fun as you did. Trust me, like the
nerdy friend of Kickass, you too will fall in love with her! Kudos to
Vaughn and team for this entertaining little gem and an extra pat on
the back for him for daring to move out of the studio system to fund
the project himself. The film is so much better for it. Don&#x27;t believe
me? Watch studio pet child Wolfman...<br /><br />Dunno wen this releases in the States but drop your pants and see this
whenever that is. The most incredibly entertaining flick of the year!!!
