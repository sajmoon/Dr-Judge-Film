So, just watched kick-ass. So many great performances, an amazing
storyline, and a swearing 11 year old girl. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. First
of all, Aaron Johnson (dave) was very good. I have been waiting so long
to say this, nick cage did great in this film. By far his best film.
Chloe Moretz (hitgirl) did great, she was by far the best performer in
this film. She was very funny, and played her role great. Lyndsy
Fonseca (katie) did very well too. She is also very hot, i might add.
And Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris a.k.a Mclovin) was also very good.
I would not recommend this to anyone under 14, or even above, but that
all just depends on maturity. It is very dirty. But again i say, it was
a great movie, good storyline, and amazing actors. I&#x27;m putting this one
in my top 5. It is well deserved as its place in the IMDb top 250.
GREAT MOVIE.
