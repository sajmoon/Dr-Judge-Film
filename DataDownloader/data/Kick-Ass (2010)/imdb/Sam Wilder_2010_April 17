This movie had all the right ingredients for a perfect movie; great
writing, compelling characters, comedy, action, a little girl cursing
and slicing off limbs. All around this movie was WAY more than I was
expecting. Going into the theater, I thought I might have just wasted
$10.50 on another movie trying to be cool for coolness sake. This movie
isn&#x27;t trying to be cool, it just is. <br /><br />This movie had a realness that is usually missing in most films made
today. The movie plays very genuine and honest, even though most of
what you&#x27;re watching is unbelievable. At times in this movie I felt
like I was watching a Tarantino movie. There is a lot of gory but
nonetheless absolutely entertaining fight scenes that are balanced out
with a lot of comedy and drama.<br /><br />Great cast, Aaron Johnson is believable. He doesn&#x27;t magically transform
into something he&#x27;s not, but has a personal awakening. Clark Duke is
funny as always and adds comedy at needed moments throughout.
Christopher Mintz-Plasse was alright. He doesn&#x27;t have everything I
thought the red mist character should have, but he did a good enough
job. We&#x27;ll see how he plays it in a sequel. Nick Cage was better than
I&#x27;ve seen him in awhile. Playing the doting father whose fathering
tactics border on insane. And finally Chloe Moretz, of 500 days of
summer fame. She absolutely stole the show. She is the best part of the
movie. Hit girl just went to the top of my most B.A. characters of all
time list. Keep an eye out for this chick in the future. She&#x27;s already
head and shoulders above most of the actresses in Hollywood. <br /><br />All in all, everything is there. There is something for everyone is
this movie. You will not leave disappointed. All I can say is GO TO THE
THEATER RIGHT NOW!
