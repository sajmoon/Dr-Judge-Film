Kick-Ass is the first great film to have come out in this decade. It&#x27;s
one helluva thrill ride you&#x27;ll definitely want to experience the minute
its over. This film is an instant cult-classic that is insanely bold,
bruising with humor, wickedly ingenious with a script that is out of
this world. This masterpiece of a movie will leave you thinking about
it long after its over. If its as hilariously unforgiving as it sounds,
then add me as a fan-boy because KA without a doubt is the best
superhero film since SPIDER-MAN 2.<br /><br />This baby is full of combinations of different genres mixed into a
blender that is bound to satisfy any moviegoer not familiar with the
comics. All hail KA for providing one of the greatest bad-ass and
kick-ass (pun-intended)comic book adaptations of all time that must be
experienced to be fully appreciated. Add this one into a time capsule.
It deserves to be seen more than once in the cinema, but without the
children respectively. Why? Because it will absolutely damage their
state of mind so leave &#x27;em with the sitter.<br /><br />KA has an artistic style characterized by highly realistic graphic
depiction of the world inhabited by masked vigilante superheroes.
Watching Kick-Ass is ultimately like being on a roller-coaster, it
doesn&#x27;t just want to dazzle you, it wants to draw you in, ride the wave
and leave the cinema on a high. I laughed like never before. It goddamn
rocks.
