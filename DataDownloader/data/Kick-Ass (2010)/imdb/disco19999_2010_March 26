Watched it tonight, it is indeed very very good and surprised me. In
some ways the trailer is misleading - it&#x27;s definitely very funny, no
doubt about that, but it&#x27;s very dark in places. I&#x27;d say only very early
scenes are played for laughs. A lot of the scenes in the second half
are full of suspense and only have &#x27;light relief&#x27; for humour. It&#x27;s
comic in the sense that, say, Snatch is. If anything it plays out like
a gangster film, with goodies and baddies taking turns to have the
upper hand. Certainly several places were brit-crime-flick in tone.
(Before you ask, yes it does work along side the equally strong &#x27;teen
comedy&#x27; side of things - he&#x27;s unwittingly drawn into this murky world)<br /><br />It was great to see the shot and dialogue nods to, well, just about
every famous superhero film - usually quite subtly (I recognised some
shots, although can&#x27;t place from where), occasionally knowingly.<br /><br />This definitely isn&#x27;t a gimmick film - it&#x27;s exceptionally well made,
with an excellent story with no &#x27;stupid&#x27; plot bits to think of,
fantastic acting and characters you care for. Some of the action scenes
are truly superb, and all different - there&#x27;s some very imaginative
stuff going on here. The trailer definitely doesn&#x27;t have all the best
bits (something I was worried about)<br /><br />Actually, more I think about it, the more I think I&#x27;ve watched
something superb tonight. Great entertainment and an excellent film.
9/10<br /><br />As an aside, come to think of it, if the entire film was no-substance
entertainment, like the trailer might imply, then there&#x27;s no way
critics would be getting such high praise - it would be getting 3/5,
6/10 etc.. Empire and Total Film have given it 5 and 4 stars because
it&#x27;s an exceptionally good film. Simple as that!
