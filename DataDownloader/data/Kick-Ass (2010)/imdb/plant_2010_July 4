Without reiterating what others have said, I will only say the
following and try to keep this short: <br /><br />There is a sequence during the last third of &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; that is
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! It involves a major character, darkness, lots of
enemies, night-vision goggles, a fantastic POV shot, and, eventually, a
strobe light attached to a gun. Except for one character, nobody
(including the viewer) can see anything or tell what&#x27;s going on unless
someone fires their weapon. This sequence is appropriately fast-paced,
exciting, violent, jaw-dropping and a MASTERPIECE!! <br /><br />See this sequence! See &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;!!
