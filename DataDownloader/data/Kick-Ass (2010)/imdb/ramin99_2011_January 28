I watched this flick to see what the hype is all about. The spoof was
nicely done and I could only watch up to the point when the little girl
turned into some kind of
Kung-Fu-master-a-la-Matrix-coolness-kicking-style killing big grown men
who looked like hood bad asses; then I stopped it right there, I guess
with Nicholas Cage shooting the said girl in a previous scene I should
have known it was all stupid/unwatchable, so I knew it was coming but I
was unsure as to when the nonsense would begin. From what I&#x27;ve seen
(half an hour) the target audience is
preteen/teenage/adolescent/pubescent junior high schoolers, still I was
surprised watching a 9-year-old, 34 kg girl could satisfy their twisted
fantasy of a tiny girl slaying tough men in gruesome manners. If you
indeed fall into this category of youngsters go for it, if you&#x27;re older
than 16 and enjoy this film you should get your head examined as soon
as possible.
