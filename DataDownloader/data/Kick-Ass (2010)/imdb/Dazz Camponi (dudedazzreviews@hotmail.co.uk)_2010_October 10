What can I say, Kick-Ass was just absolutely fantastic and such a
brilliant experience. The story was brilliantly written and very
clever. The actors were fantastic and they really brought their
characters to life, especially Chloe Grace Moretz who played the
awesome 11-year-old superhero Hit Girl who probably had the most
violent scenes in the movie and used the most bad language too. Aaron
Johnson, who plays the main character Kick-Ass, was brilliant and he
played his character about an ordinary teenager wanting to be a
superhero, cleaning the streets from crime brilliantly. The direction
was done very well and the cinematography was outstanding, the action
scenes were fantastically executed and the script was very cleverly
written. Kick-Ass isn&#x27;t really one of those comedy movies where you
laugh a lot, actually you&#x27;d be surprised of how dark it really is. It&#x27;s
a dark comedy and it&#x27;s guaranteed that you&#x27;ll enjoy it.<br /><br />Since seeing the trailer for this movie in January, this was one of the
movies I really wanted to see this year. Kick-Ass manages to smash all
expectations to smithereens and manages to be original and not fall
into the been-there-done-that superhero movies we normally see today.
Kick-Ass was a roller-coaster made to draw you into the movie, leaving
you with a grin on your face. It wasn&#x27;t made to amaze you or to be
good, it was made to be great and something out-of-the-ordinary and I
believe it succeeded with great ease.<br /><br />Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
