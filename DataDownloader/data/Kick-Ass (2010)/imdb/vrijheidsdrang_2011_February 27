Can ordinary humans become a super hero? that is the theme question
which Kick-Ass tries to answer. And for the first half our of the
movie, I was positively surprised at the witty, intelligent and funny
way in which Kick-Ass tries to answer this question. We witness an
average teen try and fail and try again to test this hypothesis. As he
gets smarter with every attempt, his luck changes and he actually
achieves his desired super-hero status about half way through the
movie.<br /><br />At that point we get introduced to Super Daddy and Hit Girl, and the
movie goes down hill form there onwards. These two characters
completely overturn the central question - they are ordinary humans,
but they do posses superpowers. They fight better than professional hit
men, dodge bullets and cannot be knocked down or break their bones. The
movie transforms into your average super-hero movie and becomes a
parody of itself. Add to this your two-dimensional villain and all the
clich&#xE9;s have been restored. What a shame.<br /><br />To top it off, the movie is filled with unnecessary gore and bad
language. Unlike in movies like Pulp Fiction or Sin City, it does not
add anything to the plot of Kick-Ass. Quite the opposite, it makes the
Hit Girl character even more unlikely and the fight between good and
evil unrealistically obvious. It seems to me that the director could
not decide what to make: an intelligent comedy, a parody or a popcorn
action movie.<br /><br />Still, Kick-Ass is not the worst movie ever. It was entertaining for
the most part and did retain a touch of comedy throughout the second
half. Just be sure to have your friends over and some beer in the
fridge if you decide to watch it.
