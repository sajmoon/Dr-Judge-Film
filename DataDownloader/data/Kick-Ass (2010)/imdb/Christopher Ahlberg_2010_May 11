Kick-Ass isn&#x27;t your average superhero movie. Unlike Spiderman or
Batman, there are no superpowers or crazy gadgets, well except for
maybe one device used at the climax. This isn&#x27;t a movie making a
mockery of superheroes either. The main character, Kick-Ass doesn&#x27;t
live up to his name. The characters don&#x27;t feel artificial because
there&#x27;s real and sometimes gruesome consequences to their actions
throughout the film. Mathew Vaughn, director of Layer Cake and
Stardust, has crafted a film that indulges in violence and stays
entertaining throughout. It&#x27;s a hybrid movie that feels like Kill Bill,
Superbad, and Spiderman were thrown into a blender. Kick-Ass is the end
result, and I feel comfortable saying it actually does, to a certain
extent.<br /><br />The relatively unknown Aaron Johnson plays Dave, a delusional, geeky
teen who pretends to be a superhero when he puts on a ridiculous green
costume. He has no superpowers and his intelligence and coordination
are obviously lacking. However, in his delusion he is determined to
stand up for what&#x27;s right. As Kick-Ass, Dave is a laughable vigilante
who gets lucky and becomes an online sensation when someone records him
scuffling with some thugs. Throughout the film, Dave conceals the
identity of Kick-Ass while his friends poke fun at him and his love
interest thinks he&#x27;s a flamer. As Kick-Ass grows in popularity, he gets
the attention of crime-boss, Frank D&#x27;Amico, played by Mark Strong. Mark
actually gives a &#x22;strong&#x22; performance as the film&#x27;s antagonist.
Kick-Ass befriends Frank&#x27;s son played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who
will forever be known as McLovin.<br /><br />The highlight of this film comes in the form of a father-daughter duo
played by Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz. When they put on their
costumes, they are Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. I found their background
story very interesting and underdeveloped. They both elevate this movie
from mediocrity and quite literally steal the show. Their relationship
is entertaining and engaging. Cage adds depth to his small role through
his bizarre speech and playful personality. Moretz, playing a
foul-mouthed 11 year old, has an aura and panache about her that is
quite unique.<br /><br />Other than Hit-Girl, I didn&#x27;t find any other adolescent characters very
interesting. Dave and his friends were mostly annoying and offered only
a few amusing scenes together. I&#x27;ve seen dorky kids like these in
countless other movies. I am pleased to say that the script isn&#x27;t full
of clich&#xE9;&#x27;s and the dialogue is pretty well-written. As with all action
movies, suspension of disbelief is necessary as the body count grows.
The violence is a little exaggerated but it fits the tone of the film
and makes it more fun to watch.<br /><br />Just some food for thought: after countless hours of training with
specialized weapons, fierce determination, a small stature, and a
thirst for vengeance, anything might be possible. If you can&#x27;t buy that
justification, how would you know anyway? Everyday someone in this
world goes against all odds and overcomes in something. Why not take a
&#x22;that&#x27;s improbable but not impossible&#x22; point of view! This was solid
entertainment that doesn&#x27;t become tiresome. Don&#x27;t let the previews
mislead you. This isn&#x27;t your mindless superhero movie or a spoof on
superhero movies. Kick-Ass is of a different breed and some (older)
people might take offense while others won&#x27;t find it very enjoyable. To
those people: what the hell are you watching a movie titled &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
for?
