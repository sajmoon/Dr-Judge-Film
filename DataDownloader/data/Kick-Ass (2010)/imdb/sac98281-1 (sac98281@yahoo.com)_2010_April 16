I would put this movie up there with Avatar as far as my favorites.
Kick-Ass is original and very good at humor. And wow, do they pull some
surprises. I heard one guy say it was way better than Ninja Assassin;
which I thought was awesome too. You can either get your ass-kicked or
you can kick-ass and that is what this movie did; BAD-ASS!! I was going
to laugh at Cage&#x27;s costume but wow he had some sweet gear; his fight
scene was awesome. The whole audience was shocked when &#x22;Daddy&#x22; and
&#x22;Mindy&#x22; were first introduced. I remember all I could say was, &#x22;Oh wow&#x22;
The Kick-Ass character was well played and funny and who, I think, a
lot of us can relate to.
