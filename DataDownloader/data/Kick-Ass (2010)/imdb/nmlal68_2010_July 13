The idea of this movie is not bad. Unfortunately, on the big screen, it
fails totally due to the dispersal of the plot. This movie wants to be
everything. Unfortunately, at the end, it&#x27;s nothing but a &#x22;pastiche&#x22; of
other movies like Batman, L&#xE9;on, Matrix, Kill Bill or Sin City without
their strength and personality. And because it is a copy or if you
like, a kind of collage of other movies, the brutality and violence
just seem to be misplaced, serving no purpose at all but the glorifying
of violence itself.<br /><br />A thing that bothered me was the (lack of) intention of the director,
who seemed to need some direction himself. What was this all about
actually? When the movie tried to be comical it was not funny. When it
tried to be serious it was kind of comical-stupid. Violence a &#x22;d&#xE9;j&#xE0;
vu&#x22;. Kick-Ass, the main character, seemed more like he was playing a
secondary role??? <br /><br />But there is another thing that is bothering me even more. Why is
everybody praising this absolute average uninteresting movie, as if it
was the new Pulp Fiction? <br /><br />Get me out of here&#x85;
