Kick-Ass is a comic book movie with a killer premise: what if regular
people in the real world became costume vigilantes like the superheroes
in comic books? Based on the uber-violent comic by Mark Millar and John
Romita Jr., this film tosses a high school teenager (Aaron Johnson)
into a crime-fighting culture he isn&#x27;t the least bit prepared for, and
then pairs him up with an adolescent schoolgirl (Chlo&#xEB; Grace Moretz)
who has been trained by a mentally unbalanced (yet absolutely loving)
father (Nicolas Cage) into becoming a ferocious filling machine. Yeah,
it&#x27;s completely f*****d up, and that&#x27;s what is both right and wrong
with the film. Your appreciation will depend in how much you can
appreciate it&#x27;s utter wrongness as a twisted virtue. Or how much you
appreciate Nicolas Cage&#x27;s impression of Adam West&#x27;s Batman. Matthew
Vaughn directs with plenty of brutal black humor, but he can&#x27;t quite
follow the real-world blowback all the way down the inevitable spiral
of doom. For all the collision between adolescent fantasy and material
world reality, it&#x27;s just another kind of superhero fantasy, but with
more blood and expletives along the way.<br /><br />The DVD features a solid commentary track by director/co-writer Matthew
Vaughn and the featurette &#x22;It&#x27;s On! The Comic Book Origin of Kick-Ass&#x22;
(with creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. and others discuss the
project&#x27;s inspiration and the collaborative process), plus a gallery of
production art. The Blu-ray supersizes the supplments. In addition to
the audio commentary is the &#x22;Ass-Kicking Bonus View,&#x22; which reverses
the usual audio-video commentary approach by filling the screen with
on-screen commentary by Vaughn intercut with cast and crew interviews
and behind-the-scenes footage while the film plays a reference track in
a corner of the screen. &#x22;A New Kind of Superhero: The Making of
Kick-Ass&#x22; is a four-part documentary that played straight through (and
there is a &#x22;Play All&#x22; function) is almost two hours long, filled with
the kind of detail that genre-junkies crave: stunts, special effects,
sets, locations, and lots of interviews with the cast and crew taking
on the extreme nature of the comic book material. The Blu-ray edition
also features the usual interactive BD-Live functions and includes a
bonus DVD and digital copy of the film for portable media players.
