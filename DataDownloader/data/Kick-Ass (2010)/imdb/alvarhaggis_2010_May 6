Kick Ass is a story we&#x27;ve seen before. The story of a young teen bored
with life, disillusioned by the modern World he lives in. A social
outcast and dare I say instantly forgettable being. One day he decides
to make a difference and sets out on a journey of self discovery and
acceptance.<br /><br />Sure we&#x27;ve seen the story a million times, but never like this. For the
first time in several years I sat through a movie without my mind
wandering or squirming in chair thinking of the numb piece of ass I am
getting. Kick Ass does exactly what it says - It Kicks Ass big time.<br /><br />The story is great, the characters perfect, the pace is superb, the
soundtrack is killer and the action is dazzling. All of the actors are
absolutely fantastic in their roles. In particular, Chloe Moretz is
simply stunning and you could feel the whole theatre get a lift every
time she appears on the screen. At 11 years old, she is all the more
impressive. She is surely destined for a wonderful career.<br /><br />The movies humour is genuinely humorous and not of the usual
half-a-smirk variety. The action is intense and extremely violent, but,
that&#x27;s what we all kind of want if we are honest. I say your a kidding
yourself if you enjoyed all of Saving Private Ryan as much as the first
15 minutes.<br /><br />The two stand out things for me though are the movies perfect pace and
sublime soundtrack. There are no dull moments in this movie, there is
no sagging in the middle, no dreary introductions. The entire movie
sits perfectly. The soundtrack could not be more perfect either.
Everything works so well.<br /><br />This movie was simply fantastic and will be my new favourite in my Blu
Ray collection when it comes out. Although very graphic and violent, it
still seems to have this charm about it and I would recommend it to all
adults. Not one for the kids though..........
