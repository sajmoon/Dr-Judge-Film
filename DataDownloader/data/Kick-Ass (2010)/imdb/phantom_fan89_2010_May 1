Superheros, caped crusaders, masked avengers, latex wearing super
studs. Why is it that these paragons of righteous humanity only exist
in our dreams? The main point of Kick Ass is to show us that
superheroes don&#x27;t exist in our modern world for a very good reason.
Kick Ass is a parody of the insanely popular comic book adaptations
that have been bombarding our theatres since the release of Spiderman
back in 2001. The satirical elements of the film seem to be lost on a
large number of critics who have branded the film with all kinds of
damaging labels; &#x27;exploitative&#x27;, &#x27;gratuitously violent&#x27;, and
&#x27;politically incorrect&#x27; to name but a few. Of course Kick Ass is all of
these things. But the film has a different motive for being so than
your normal run of the mill action pick.<br /><br />Kick Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, an avid comic book fan who
wonders why no-one has ever thought of becoming a superhero? The
constantly unnoticed and downtrodden Dave decides to do what others
only dream of and create a crime fighting alter ego Kick Ass. Dave soon
realises that being a superhero is harder than he thought, especially
after only narrowly escaping with his life on many occasions. Dave&#x27;s
problems escalate when Mafia kingpin Frank D&#x27;Amico thinks Kick Ass is
behind a slew of recent drug busts that is actually the work of real
vigilantes Big Daddy and Hit Girl.<br /><br />Unlike most comic book adaptations Kick Ass does not glorify violence.
The graphic nature of the fight scenes serve to humanize the actions.
They do not appear heroic, just a big bloody mess. The film also
explores the consequences of violence. Every time our hero engages in a
battle he is beaten to a bloody pulp and only narrowly escapes with his
life.<br /><br />Most of the flack received by the film centre&#x27;s around the character of
eleven year old, foul mouthed vigilante Hit Girl. Why exactly is it
that this character has received condemnation from family groups
worldwide, especially since the MA 15+ film has never been marketed as
anything less than strictly adult entertainment? Sure Hit Girl is like
a pint sized Rambo, but is she any more disturbing than the mass
murdering, psychopathic child in Orphan? The sociopathic, serial killer
played by Macaulay Culkin in The Good Soon? A callous, bloodthirsty
Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire? There are countless other
examples of child exploitation, but Kick Ass seems to be the film
taking the beating. The fact that director Matthew Vaughn is making the
point that Hit Girl is a product of our increasingly violent culture
seems to be lost on most naysayers. He makes the statement that
superhero films glorify violence so much that in our society it is
perfectly within the realms of possibility for an eleven year old to
wish for guns and knives for her birthday.<br /><br />Kick Ass is a rollicking good farce and anyone who attempts to view it
as a straight up action film is going to have trouble. It successfully
pokes fun at many generic superhero conventions; the death of a loved
one, the arrival of a superpower (which in Dave&#x27;s case is a slightly
heightened ability to take pain due to nerve damage sustained in a
fight), the superhero costume ( a green scuba suit which Dave attempts
to wear underneath his clothes at all times), the training regime, the
nerd boy who likes popular girl, the showdown and the inevitable sequel
setup.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional. Nicholas Cage gives his best performance in
years as Big Daddy, Chloe Moretz almost steals the film as Hit Girl,
Christopher Mintz- Plasse brings the laughs as Red Mist and Mark Strong
delivers another exceptional villain. The film&#x27;s star Aaron Johnson
continues to show his versatility as an actor, possessing the humility
to make Dave pathetic enough that the audience just can&#x27;t help but root
for him.<br /><br />Kick Ass is a unique film that deserves to find a large audience.
Here&#x27;s hoping that audiences will get past the controversy and be able
to view the film for the delightful romp that it is.
