This is possibly one of my all time favourite films. And definitely one
of the best superhero films I&#x27;ve seen.<br /><br />Not only is the casting great, the costumes and set design fantastic,
the filming flawless, but the writing is perfect. The movie manages to
keep you on the edge of your proverbial seat right till the end
credits, not only with the brilliant action sequences which show very
realistic looking stunts and manages to stay roughly within the real of
the not- so-ridiculously-impossible but also with the sense of mystery
and intrigue about characters, plans and romance. <br /><br />Unlike most comedy films where the they mock an overused genre, &#x22;Kick-
Ass&#x22; actually portrays very realistic character motivation and
progression. Almost every aspect of the film that you expect to be
unexplained and left down to narrative license, is fully accounted for.<br /><br />Whilst accomplishing all this, the script manages to be genuinely funny
and at times surprises you with a line or scene even funnier than you
anticipated. It manages to be funny, an honest superhero film and steer
clear of mocking the genre in any way.<br /><br />By the time &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is over, you&#x27;re left with a content feeling that
all the loose ends have been tied up, every inconvenient detail they
could have left out they cover before the film is over in a
satisfactory manner and you even come out of it wondering if you should
purchase some nunchuks...
