Cinema today has become over saturated enough as it is with superhero
flicks, be it Marvel, DC or anything else less mainstream. So it&#x27;s
quiet refreshing that they&#x27;re willing to bring more cult classics onto
the big screen.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is a sort of a self parody in someways as it seems to satire
the whole superhero concept from beginning to end. The writer of the
comics, Mark Millar, even said that the idea was based off of his own
desire to be a superhero growing up in Scotland. It feels somewhat
believable that a teenage looser might actually try this out someday
resulting in this much mishap, for the first half of the film anyway
since towards the end it gets more over-the-top. The writing is well
thought out with a great sense of irony and humor, even really dark and
brutally violent scenes will bring a devious grin to your face.
Characters feel believable and are easy to connect with, especially Hit
Girl who has to be one of the most interesting characters I&#x27;ve ever
seen in cinema. It&#x27;s hilarious how one critic accused the film makers
for making this eleven-year-old girl &#x27;sexulized&#x27; but then bawled when
he was accused of pedophilia himself, as though he expected anything
else! That little rant aside, Kick-Ass is a refreshing and amusing
piece of work that should have you coming back for more. Roll on the
sequel!
