&#x27;KICK-ASS&#x27;: Five Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />This is one of those movies that you&#x27;re so hyped up about after
watching it that you can&#x27;t wait to tell your friends and see it again!
It&#x27;s definitely a crowd pleas-er and seeing it with an enthusiastic
overwhelmed audience only enhances the effect of the movie. The film is
a darkly comedic and excessively violent superhero satire based on the
popular comic book of the same name (By Mark Millar and John Romita
Jr.).<br /><br />It tells the story of an average nerdy high schooler named Dave
Lizewski (played by Aaron Johnson) who&#x27;s so obsessed with comic books
and super-heroes that he decides to become one. In his first attempt
he&#x27;s severely beaten and injured but much of his damaged body is
replaced by steel implants which make him much more successful his
second time out. He has no real powers but he wears a green costume and
can take a serious beating. After being caught on tape and made famous
to the entire world Dave, known as &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; to the rest of the world,
becomes an inspiration to people everywhere including a father, Damon
Macready (played by a scene stealing Nicolas Cage), bent on revenge
against the town mob boss (played by Mark Strong). Macready and his
eleven year old daughter Mindy (played by the very impressive Chloe
Moretz), whom he&#x27;s trained to be a killing machine since birth, dawn
superhero costumes of their own as &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; and &#x27;Hit-Girl&#x27; and wage
a war against the local crime ring which &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; is believed
responsible for.<br /><br />The film is raunchy, hilarious, surprisingly emotionally dramatic at
times and just an action packed blast to watch. It&#x27;s extremely well
written and directed (by Matthew Vaughn, of &#x27;LAYER CAKE&#x27; and &#x27;STARDUST&#x27;
fame) and this is by far his best work yet. The film, like I said, is
excessively violent and is probably the most violent super-hero movie
ever made. It&#x27;s been criticized by some for this reason but I think
these critics are missing the point. The film is a great gift to comic
book and super-hero fans everywhere and is already one of the most
popular films ever in this genre (according to IMDb user ratings).<br /><br />It&#x27;s one of those movies that perfectly builds tension and then
releases to the utmost satisfaction to the viewer. The score is
perfect, the pacing and editing is perfect and the movie just hits all
the right notes for it&#x27;s near 2 hour running time perfectly. It&#x27;s a
classic that I&#x27;m sure will be remembered and loved for many years to
come and anyone who criticizes it for it&#x27;s so called &#x27;offensive
content&#x27; isn&#x27;t watching the movie for what it really is; an
inspirational and satirical ode to comic books and super-heroes; a
masterpiece in my opinion.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
