I give this a 9/10 because it&#x27;s a movie that doesn&#x27;t take a graphic
novel or comic book series and butcher it (i.e. Spiderman, loved the
first two differences aside but the third was disgusting.) or the
X-Men. Although varying in places from the comic books in which it&#x27;s
based, Kick-Ass stays true to the source material much more often than
it doesn&#x27;t, resulting in a great mixture of comedy, action, and
suspenseful scenes that make you wonder what&#x27;s going to happen next.<br /><br />For those of you who think the violence is over the top and too
graphic, you need only watch movies like Watchmen or any other R-rated
comic-book film. Chances are the violence is there because it was there
in the comics, as is the case with Kick-Ass. Dumbing down the violence
for a movie based on an equally violent comic would be doing the true
fans of the series a great injustice and at the end of the day, those
who decide to tackle movies based on comic-books are often great fans
themselves.<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t enjoy a lot of graphic violence, you can opt out of seeing
this movie, but remember it&#x27;s not there to be &#x22;hip&#x22; as some reviewers
are saying, it&#x27;s there because it&#x27;s supposed to be there to keep the
movie faithful to the source.<br /><br />I hope this review helps!
