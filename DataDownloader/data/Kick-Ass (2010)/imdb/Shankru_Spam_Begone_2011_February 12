If you liked Oldboy, you&#x27;ll like this film.<br /><br />I hated Oldboy, if that&#x27;s any indicator of how I felt about Kick-Ass. I
think some of the Hollywood directors are going for distinction in the
&#x22;Cruelest&#x22; category, judging from the content of many recent films from
America. And frankly, I worry about sharing the planet with the people
who have given this movie rave reviews and high rating numbers.<br /><br />This film is excessively violent and graphic, and I just could not
watch the final moments. I&#x27;m already concerned that some of the images
might stick unwanted in my memory.<br /><br />That said, the lead actor, Aaron Johnson (who was brilliant in Nowhere
Boy ) and the little girl turned in awesome performances. Where do they
find these brilliant children? This little scamp will tear your heart
out, just as she did for her neighbor in the film.<br /><br />I think what really bothers me about films like this is that
threatening to commit the kind of cruelties they carry out here would
be sufficient. Instead, nothing is left to the imagination, which is
frightening enough. It&#x27;s all played out in very gory fashion.<br /><br />Just want to warn you, if you&#x27;re a lover and not a sadistic fighter.
