2011_December 1 
I saw half of the film on HBO several months ago in the hotel room and
it became another unfinished business which had been gnawing at me
until yesterday I eventually watched it from A to Z, and my response is
that it&#x27;s really a kick-ass to all other major film studio comic
superhero franchises! <br /><br />I don&#x27;t intend to put a stance to appreciate this film just to feign
that my heart is still as young as a schoolboy. I love this film from
the bottom of my heart and I emphatically believe director Matthew
Vaugh has done a stupendous job which almost alter the entire formula
of the corny genre and what&#x27;s more worth a round of standing ovation is
that the film is killingly entertaining as well!<br /><br />Hit-girl is predestined to become a cult idol along with the film
itself (and its box office fiasco is a bonus), the controversy she
created has becoming a sensational impressiveness which stuns the
youngster generation and some maturer age group like mine. A 12 year
old slaughterer with an innocent loli&#x27;s face and mind, which may not be
original but definitive provocative, and the gratifying yet unsettling
part is Chlo&#xEB;&#x27;s steadfast-cum-innocuous performance, killing only could
be such fun in a morally nontoxic way which a film is able to manifest
and I can sense the surreal zest pervading in the air! <br /><br />Kick-ass (an unostentatious Aaron Johnson) by comparison, is a more
empathizing character, which is also dealt with some realistic impetus
to allow viewers to judge it by a more rational afterthought, a true
hero never need the shield of &#x22;super&#x22; power, all one needs is training
and proper equipment, a pragmatic truth (it&#x27;s more convenient if you
are as filthy rich as Iron Man or Batman).<br /><br />The film and the directing definitely crack into my top 10 list of the
year and Chlo&#xEB; is among my top 3 supporting actress in 2010 as well.
Also I feel a bit belated compassion that Matthew Vaugh&#x27;s forte didn&#x27;t
been fully brought into play in the X-MEN: FIRST CLASS this year as
sadly few could substantiate his true color under the mainstream
Hollywood sway, especially for those newly-recruited.
