Based on British writer Mark Millar&#x27;s comic book series, this is an
ultraviolent satire from the writer/director team behind 2007&#x27;s
Stardust. Like that film, Kick-Ass tweaks the nipples of genre
convention to create something bold, distinctive and memorable. Unlike
that film, Kick-Ass&#x27;s central love story is between a father and
daughter, the former educating the latter by shooting her in the chest
with a handgun from ten yards. <br /><br />The plot concerns a normal kid, Dave Lizewski (Nowhere Boy&#x27;s Aaron
Johnson) &#x96; not an uber-geek or a ruffian &#x96; who dreams of being a
superhero. When a mugging leaves his nerve-endings ruined, he
unwittingly finds himself allied with the twisted dream team of Big
Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) as they seek to take down
the vicious crime-lord, Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong). Impalements,
over-sized microwaves and dual-handgun ballet ensue.<br /><br />If film-making is a process of small judgements adding up to a single
whole then Goldman and Vaughan get most the decisions right. The pacing
is superb, with the snappy, fabulously foul-mouthed script bridging a
series of thrillingly inventive set-pieces, chief among which are Hit
Girl&#x27;s introduction as she splatters the walls of a drug den to The
Banana Splits theme song (a possible reference to the grandfather of
the modern superhero movie, Richard Donner), as well as a first-person
perspective rescue mission played out to a re-working of John Murphy&#x27;s
&#x22;Kaneda&#x27;s Death&#x22; theme from Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine.<br /><br />There are a couple of cons. D&#x27;Amico is a familiar mob boss with
familiar patriarchal issues; he could have used a perversion or two
aside from bloodlust. And Big Daddy&#x27;s old police buddy (Omari Hardwick)
is unfortunately sidelined, destined to remain perennial backup, as if
too damn honest to spoil the party. And what about Xander Berkeley&#x27;s
sporadically glimpsed Gigante? Perhaps the sequel (&#x22;Balls to the Wall&#x22;)
will share the love more evenly. <br /><br />Unlike the bloodless, toothless, sexless Scott Pilgrim Versus the
World, Kick-Ass spits vile anarchy from every orifice. Both films are
wish- fulfilment fantasies for grown-up geeks, but while Scott Pilgrim
reduces the sub-genre to 8-bit whimsy, Kick-Ass enhances it to
glorious, eye- gouging HD.
