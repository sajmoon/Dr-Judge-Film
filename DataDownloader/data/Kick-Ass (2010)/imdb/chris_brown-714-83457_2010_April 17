Kick Ass serves up the goods in an original and raw but stylish and
well executed manner. The first trailers seem to downplay the intensity
of this film but make no mistake, Kick Ass is as intense and gutsy as
they come. <br /><br />This movie that will make you cringe, laugh(a lot), smile and overall
feel thoroughly entertained. It&#x27;s loaded with superb action sequences,
raw violence, engaging humor and just plain awesomeness. Every
character is well developed and the acting is excellent. Chloe Moretz
steals the show but every actor is spot on with their performance. <br /><br />My advice would be the less you know about this film going into it the
more enjoyable it will be. So if you like action and comedy and can
stomach graphic violence and crude humor this is a must see. Don&#x27;t
watch anymore trailers just go see it!<br /><br />10/10
