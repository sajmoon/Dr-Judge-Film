One of the most satisfying action movies I have seen in a very long
time, so good that I actually forgot what other movies I have seen
recently.<br /><br />Synopsis: Dave is a typical high school comic book nerd who one day
decides to become a super hero, even though he has no powers. Things
never go right from the start and only got worse when he got intertwine
with the mafia who is out to kill him.<br /><br />What I love about this movie was it bases its story on reality. There
are no super power, no nothing &#x96; just a simple geek pretend to be a
super hero and basically everything that would happen if one pretends
they are a superhero. <br /><br />Kick-Ass might not be the most original movie but it is among the best
executed superhero movie ever created. I think the R rated really help
bringing out the best of its story because it is so intelligence and so
violent it is satisfying to watch (really tired to see this PG13
superhero movie).<br /><br />Anyway the casting got to be one of the highlight of the movie with the
Hit Girl came out as the most lovable character with her sharp witted
sarcasm and her ability to kill. By the end you seriously want more of
her. Nic Cage did seriously surprise me here &#x96; Big Daddy totally rock!
His solo fight got to be one of the best action sequences (Which later
topple by a scene by Hit Girl save Big Daddy Scene). Dave (aka
Kick-Ass) is one of the most realistic superhero. He is courageous but
also very fragile.<br /><br />The movie also comes in with brilliant score and music that fitted
perfectly with the mood and tone of the movie especially during the
action sequences. I guess it is the good thing when the studio decides
someone with great vision do the movie. Matthew Vaughn really turning
himself into one of the most sought after director in Hollywood.<br /><br />Overall the movie fulfills my every expectation. One of the very few
action movies that managed to do almost everything right. Totally fell
in love with it. <br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, Get yourself a BlueRay !! <br /><br />Rating: A<br /><br />* Give it a 9/10 for too open ending.
