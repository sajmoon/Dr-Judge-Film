This film is very entertaining. Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the burnt
out, mad at the system, mad at life, mad at the bad guy typical (in my
view) gun toting American Dad who is bringing his daughter up to be the
all new slightly disturbed female RAMBO. Cloe Moretz defies her age by
putting in a very adult performance as a not too slightly twisted young
HitGirl. It should really worry her parents that she could make the
role so believable. Aaron Johnson also plays a great role as the lead
and managed to make me both want to punch him and also want him to
succeed so much. Finally, what can I say about Lyndsy Fonseca.... That
girl is so hot, I heard the rest of the cast suffered third degree
burns when ever they performed with her.<br /><br />The film does fall a little into the typical American &#x22;Boy meets girl
who is so far out of his league. Boy does something really great. Super
sexy girl suddenly falls totally in love with geeky boy&#x22; etc etc etc.
That though is the only flaw I would tag the film with. It is
entertaining, fast paced, full of action, explosion, bad guys,
henchman, more explosions, blood, guts, legs being removed, more
explosions and lots and lots of tongue in cheek comedy.<br /><br />Definitely a recommended watch. Even if it&#x27;s just to see Lyndsy Fonseca
in just her undies.....I&#x27;m in love
