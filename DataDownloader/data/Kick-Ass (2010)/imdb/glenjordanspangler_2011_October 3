Early in the story Kick-Ass does a good job of illustrating what would
really happen if someone decided to be a superhero (i.e., lots of
pain). Later it becomes increasingly clear that this is itself a
superhero movie, and has begun playing by superhero-movie rules.
Physics and happenstance conspire with increasing frequency in favor of
the good guys, rendering the movie&#x27;s original premise--why doesn&#x27;t
anyone really do this, and what would happen if they did--once again
meaningless.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is funny, well-written and suspenseful throughout,
though--just in different ways as the story turns. Hit-Girl is
brilliant creation who forsakes all little-girl things in favor of her
paramilitary training, jumps impossibly across all surfaces, and treats
her enemies like fillets in a Japanese restaurant. But although she and
Kick-Ass often have the amazing luck of Hollywood, be warned that they
can get hurt.<br /><br />Why you should see it You&#x27;re a superhero geek. You like action movies.
You&#x27;ve been trying for years to get up the nerve to get that costume
out of its hiding place in the attic and go fight some evil. Or at
least start your training at the local gym.<br /><br />Why you should avoid it Cursing of any kind makes you say, &#x22;oh, my
goodness!,&#x22; so hearing a 13-year-old girl using the &#x22;f&#x22; word would
probably make you say, &#x22;oh, my! What kind of movie is this?!?,&#x22; turn
red and run from the room.<br /><br />--from my review at www.1man365movies.com
