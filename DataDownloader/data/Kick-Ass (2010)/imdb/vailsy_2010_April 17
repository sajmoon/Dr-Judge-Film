I&#x27;d advise you to click on the username of each person giving this
movie a 10 rating and you&#x27;ll notice most of them have written no other
reviews on IMDb. That is blatant ratings manipulation done to lure
unsuspecting people into a movie theatre<br /><br />If you&#x27;re 14 you&#x27;ll probably like this movie. If you are 18 you&#x27;ll
cringe. If you&#x27;re any older than that you&#x27;ll fall to sleep <br /><br />The movie is a big bunch of nothing, a 10 minute at best comedy sketch
painfully stretched out to two hours duration. Funny for a short while
and then strained - a crap parody of a crap movie trend toward
superheros <br /><br />Nicolas Cage is okay in this but he&#x27;s not in it enough to make any
major impact <br /><br />I&#x27;m very sceptical that the target audience of this movie would be well
organized enough to come onto IMDb and rate this movie at 8.4 so I can
guess that people are either listening to the hype and not to their own
intuition and/or that the rating for this film is being highly massaged<br /><br />A real dud
