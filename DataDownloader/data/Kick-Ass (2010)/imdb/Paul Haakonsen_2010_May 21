I thought that &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; was going to be more of a comedy that would
leave you laughing your ass off.<br /><br />The story is pretty good, and have lots of interesting characters in
it. Both main characters and supporting ones have been given good
detail in being fleshed out on the screen.<br /><br />Now what surprised me the most was seeing Nicholas Cage in that role. I
am not much of a fan of him, truth be told, but this time he was
actually cool to look at. Especially the scene where he is toughening
up the girl for a gunshot experience. I was laughing so hard at that
scene.<br /><br />As for the effects and stuff, well they were nice. Lots of cool things
going on in the movie.<br /><br />Another great &#x27;superhero&#x27; movie without super powers. Although &#x22;Kick
Ass&#x22; is cool, it just doesn&#x27;t reach &#x22;Defendor&#x22; to the knees. But I
don&#x27;t think &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; will leave you disappointed though.<br /><br />Lots of nice action and a good, steady flow to the story, so you are
never left bored. And the scenes with Hit Girl in action, wow! That was
amazing, a young girl like that doing those kinds of scenes, that was
awesome. Actually, I was surprised at the amount of action and blood in
the movie.<br /><br />&#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; have something for everyone, so you should check out this
movie. If you like this one, you might want to turn your attention to
&#x22;Defendor&#x22; as well.
