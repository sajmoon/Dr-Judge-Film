Lets keep it simple. Kick Ass is not your usual super hero movie, It
have something different to offer. I will call this movie a pulp of The
dark knight, Spider man, Kill bill and Super bad. Its a teen movie with
adult theme and it bends perfectly well. I know there is a hype against
the Violence and language specially about the 11 yr old &#x22;Hit-Girl&#x22;. Its
a fictional movie and let be fictional. Yes may be some parents will
offend to see that. If all directors started to care about parents,
only Disney will survive... anyway thats not my point. Watch Kick-Ass
if you want something new in superhero/comic movies, because it really
kick ass.
