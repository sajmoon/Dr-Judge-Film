KICK ASS &#x96; CATCH IT ( A- ) I&#x27;ve been waiting for Kick Ass Since last
Summer, because it just the genre I like Comic book, Hardcore, Brutal &#x26;
SeXxy. KiCk Ass surely Live up to the 95% Of my Expectations, there are
some Flaws which can be Cover, Because sometimes it goes Over the top &#x26;
little Unbelievable. But still it manages to bounds you because Of its
strong cast &#x26; Script. AarOn JohnsOn is Amazing, Adorable &#x26; Cutest Thing
On the planet. He is Geeky &#x26; Stupid, which is just Adorable. We Love
Our Heroes to be Charming &#x26; he is Indeed. He is Geeky when he is in
School &#x26; Kicking Ass when he is Literally Kicking Ass. But its ChlOe
Moretz who just stole the ShOw with her Amazing HIT GIRL Avatar, she is
so Charming &#x26; Adorable that you instantly fall in Love with her &#x26; when
she starts KiCKing Ass as hit Girl, she literally Blow you Away with
Cute FaCe &#x26; Body to move like a Weapon. That&#x27;s Incredible. Nicolas Cage
is BIG DADDY is Awesome, I never liked em Besides National
Treasure,Face Off &#x26; Con Air But he surely is hell Of an Actor.
Christopher Mintz-Plasse is good but somehow he didn&#x27;t looked like Mark
Strong&#x27;s Son. Mark Strong is great as a Villain Again after Star Dust,
Sherlock Holmes &#x26; now KiCk- Ass, he is the New Best Bad import from
U.k.Lyndsy FonSeca is Cute as the love Interest of Aaron Johnson Aka.
KICK ASS. Overall a gr8 move to enjoy. Must CATCH IT.
