2010_April 4 
This film is truly amazing. I think I just gave away the entire
conclusion of this review, but that&#x27;s probably because I can no longer
think coherently because it was so mind-blowing! Kick-Ass is the brain
child of Mark Millar who wrote the original comic series and it&#x27;s lost
nothing of the original charm in its translation to the big screen (by
Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn).<br /><br />It stars Aaron Johnson, as the geeky lead and even in this guise he&#x27;s a
little bit delicious. I&#x27;m not just in awe of his looks though, together
with Clark Duke and Evan Peters they give an amazing performance, and
you can tell it all them because their lines are witty but the delivery
and the background actions are ludicrously funny. Chloe Moretz gives an
impressive performance as 11 year old hit girl, being only this age
herself it undeniable that she can act (and kick some serious butt) but
at times it felt as though she didn&#x27;t always appear to know what was
going on. The only other minor flaw seems to be that Christopher
Mintz-Plasse appears to be playing his character from Superbad, again.
This isn&#x27;t enough to detract from the film as whole in anyway, more a
passing comment you&#x27;ll not when leaving the cinema.<br /><br />The film is a triple threat; it can sing, dance and act. The soundtrack
is superb, featuring the likes of The Prodigy and Ellie Goulding it&#x27;s
worth buying in its own right. It&#x27;s use within the film is possibly the
best I&#x27;ve seen this year. &#x22;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for the Both of
Us&#x22; by Sparks is used with such fantastic timing it will have you in
stitches. The camera-work (and editing) is jaw-dropping. This is art
house style with a mainstream budget, and it is beautiful. I want to
hug the cameramen.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why you wouldn&#x27;t want to see this. There is some serious
weapons, some eye-popping action and some comic-book legends. If you
want gore? You can have it. If you want laughs? You got them. If you
want romance? It&#x27;s there (and it&#x27;s cute). If you want 117 minutes of
pure, quality entertainment, I urge you, go see Kick-Ass.
