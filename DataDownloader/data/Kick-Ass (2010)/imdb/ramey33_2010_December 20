When I picked up this movie from Redbox over the weekend, it wasn&#x27;t my
first choice. There were a lot of other movies out there that sparked
my interest, but this was really the only one left that I had any
interest to see. I am so happy I chose to watch this movie. I first
thought this was going to be a funny, ad lib, joking around movie
considering Mark Duke and Christopher Mintz-Plasse were in it. Then I
started to watch, and become so engrossed in the sheer genius of how it
all came together. I tell my friends this movie is from the perspective
of &#x22;What would happen if someone ACTUALLY put on a super hero costume
and tried to fight crime?&#x22; Not with all the fancy gadgets or super
powers, but with everyday weapons. I was really impressed with all the
cast, but especially Chloe Moretz. I mean, where did this girl come
from?! Nicholas Cage and She did a wonderful job working together and
really made the movie what it was. A kick ass action movie with lots of
laughs and gruesome action scenes.
