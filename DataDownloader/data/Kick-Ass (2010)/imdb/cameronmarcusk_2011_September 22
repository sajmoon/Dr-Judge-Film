Simply said, such a great film. I won&#x27;t give too much away but in
essence, this film is about a young high school student who loves comic
books and wonders the world has so much evil, yet people stand and do
nothing. It&#x27;s not so much the plot of this movie that is so intriguing
but the way in which it is handled. Every aspect of this movie is taken
realistically, in a way that leaves the audience with no questions of
disbelief. The cast in this is incredible. Definitely a breakthrough
performance from Aaron Johnson, and Chloe Moretz is hilarious. The
biggest on-screen persona comes from none other than Nic Cage as Big
Daddy. The patriarchal-revenge-crazy Cage is astounding to watch and
the action throughout is immensely thrilling. While few other movies
are as compelling, Cage&#x27;s next best &#x22;Trespass&#x22; looks like a winner. Do
yourself a favor and check out the trailer. http://on.fb.me/pchomT
