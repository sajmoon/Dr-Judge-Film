I went in to see kick-ass last night with high hopes. I had already
expected it to be amazing and the best film of the year but it was so
much better than i had hoped. For starters, the acting was amazing from
everyone. The comedy scenes had everyone laughing throughout the entire
movie. The fight scenes were just amazing and enjoyable in every way. I
really don&#x27;t know how this movie could fail. The only bad thing for
them was that the movie was rated R. If it was pg-13 The opening
weekend sales would have been much higher. But this is one movie that
everyone will want to own on DVD if not for the extra scenes alone. If
you haven&#x27;t yet, Go see kick-ass!!
