&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; can kick ass as a comedy of well timed jokes but there is
also some strong disturbing scenes of violence.<br /><br />&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; is Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a teenager who is
infatuated with Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) a long term crush he has
on a girl. He loves comics and decides to dress up as a superhero and
fight crime as &#x27;Kick Ass&#x27;. He then beats up a group of men beating up
one man which is recorded and put up on You-Tube.<br /><br />While fighting against Frank D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s (Mark Strong) men he is unable
to beat Rasul (one of D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s men) or his men so Hit Girl (Chloe
Moretz) and her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) come to help and kill
all the men in a truly violent manner. The reason Big Daddy wanys to
kill D&#x27;Amico is that he is the reason Big Daddy&#x27;s wife died. So can the
superheroes stop D&#x27;Amico or will Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse)
who is D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s son kill the heroes.<br /><br />The movie is extremely gory with gruesome scenes and a huge amounts of
funny moments.
