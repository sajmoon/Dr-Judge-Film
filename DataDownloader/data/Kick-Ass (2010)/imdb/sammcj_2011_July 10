Absolutely terrible film.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t remember the last time I walked out during a film.<br /><br />By far the worst film I&#x27;ve never seen Nicolas Cage act in.<br /><br />Appalling acting.<br /><br />A simplistic script that is far from witty. Cringeworthy clich&#xE9;
one-liners. Cheap potty-humor.<br /><br />I can see how some children would find the movie fun however it
wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate for them to watch.<br /><br />If you have the slightest taste in film and would consider yourself
even mildly intelligent, I would urge you NOT to see this film!
