Watched Kick Ass today...wow what an amazing film. A very unique plot
and many laugh out loud moments keep you in your seat. The director
puts you right there where the action is and keeps the movie flowing.
All the characters did a fantastic job!<br /><br />A well done movie all together! There is the high school experience and
the family life. Expect the unexpected, and the movie doesn&#x27;t dumb you
down. Superbad meets Kill Bill is an excellent analogy for this movie.
It pays homage to every super hero ever and guess what? I have my new
superhero! Kick ass definitely can spawn a lot of other movies in the
same genre...what genre that is? I am not sure. Go see it...you won&#x27;t
be disappointed.
