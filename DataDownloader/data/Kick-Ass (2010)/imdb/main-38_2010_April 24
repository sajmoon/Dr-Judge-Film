2010_April 24 
I waited a really long time to see Kick Ass because I have a lot of
comic book, fan boy friends who always gripe and complain about how
inaccurate the adaptations are and how little attention is paid to
details from the original story whenever we get together to watch one
of these movies. Honestly, I would rather take a brutal ass kicking
than sit through another movie with one of them painstakingly tearing
the movie apart. It was for that reason that I stayed home when they
went out and saw it and waited until now to get my own, unbiased and
completely fan boy free opinion.<br /><br />The film takes great elements from good old run and gun Kung Fu shoot
em&#x27; ups, blood soaked, gore fests and sadistic, dark comedies. It
combines these elements with initially traditional hero and villain
archetypes which audiences members are used to and creates a new,
offbeat and non contemporary world where everyday citizens are afraid
to face any kind of evil that lurks in the shadows.<br /><br />That is until a few misfits realize that there are no REAL superheros
out there and there&#x27;s a desperate need for change- as well as a bit of
well placed retribution.<br /><br />In my opinion they cast the Kick Ass character perfectly. Aaron Johnson
is the epitome of pathetic and invisible until he dons the skin green
and yellow tight scuba suit and Timberlands and takes to the streets.
Nick Cage is still Nick Cage, but I take back a few of the things I&#x27;ve
said about him (only some). He really diluted himself and became
something different than what we&#x27;re all used to seeing. He didn&#x27;t even
have overtly goofy hair! But, it was really Chloe Moretz that took the
cake. Her comedic timing was perfect and, out of all the characters, I
felt for her the most. As Hit Girl she was a miniature Uma Thurman in
Kill Bill. There are not many movies that come to mind when I think
cold blooded killer and also prepubescent girl. It was new and
different to see a girl portrayed in movie like this doing the kind of
things she did.<br /><br />Overall, it&#x27;s a fun movie. On the core it&#x27;s a mixture of a few very
different kind of films. It&#x27;s both feel good, semi-comedy and also a
commentary on society; while it still serves up enough gun Kata
inspired violence and fighting to win over even the most stoic of movie
nerds. It makes one consider the plight of the human condition when
people will turn the other cheek when they see a mugging, although, it
sends kind of a positive message that if people are pushed far enough
they can do some pretty crazy, amazing things.
