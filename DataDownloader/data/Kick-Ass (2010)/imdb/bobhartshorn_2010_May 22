From out of nowhere comes what could possibly be the most vibrant,
satirical, subversive comic-genre movie since Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s
&#x27;Robocop&#x27;. This very violent, and very funny, superhero romp&#x27;s cheerful
exterior is littered with booby traps that will sucker punch you into
submission. <br /><br />Superbly adapted by director Vaughn and co-writer Goldman from Mark
Millar &#x26; John Romita&#x27;s graphic-novel of the same name, this razor-sharp
concoction of comedy and bone-crunching action takes bang-on-target
swipes at the Youtube/X-Factor generation to deliver a timely snapshot
of this (seemingly) never-ending, reality-TV/Celebrity obsessed era. <br /><br />Johnson&#x27;s no-mark, schoolboy wallflower turned angst-free costumed
crime fighter with no purpose/powers, is a welcome breath of fresh air
to this over stuffed genre, as real life repeatedly crashes in on his
Spiderman attempts at super-heroics - ie: he gets seriously, seriously
hurt. <br /><br />But the fun really begins when he finds himself truly out of his depth
when he unwittingly locks horns with the real deal: Cage&#x27;s superb
Batman send-up &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;, and the much hyped, controversial,
murderous tot - &#x27;Hitgirl&#x27;. Add Mark Strong&#x27;s vicious hoodlum and
pseudo-superhero son &#x27;Red Mist&#x27; (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to the
colour-coded mix, and you have one of the most engaging and
entertaining bunch of characters to waltz across the screen since
&#x27;Superbad&#x27; (which this movie draws favourable comparisons with).<br /><br />And finally, any piece of celluloid that has the Daily Mail&#x27;s resident,
right-wing knee-jerker film &#x27;critic&#x27; (Christopher Tookey) foaming at
the mouth about it&#x27;s &#x27;Disturbing&#x27; content, has got to be a serious
contender for movie of the century! <br /><br />Verdict: Awesome!
