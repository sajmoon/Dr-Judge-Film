I loved it because, this lil girl can really &#x22;Hit&#x22; bad guys. Lotsa
action...I gave it a 7 because they could have done more with &#x22;Big
Daddy.&#x22; If you like just plain old violence and killing, then this
movie would be it. Really no story, just gratuitous &#x22;Ass Kicking&#x22; by a
12 year old girl... Loved it...lol Kick Ass really doesn&#x27;t sell to me.
He could have done a little more with his character other than being a
lame somewhat of a super-hero crime fighter vigilante with really no
skills at all, who by luck happened to appear winning at a losing
battle in the early part of the show. He could have done a little more
with his character, but I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be a comedy too. It
was an okay movie, the only real thing I liked about this movie is &#x22;Hit
Girl&#x22;, and her action moves. She was really good. I wouldn&#x27;t want my
daughter to have her foul mouth, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind her being able to
protect herself and have the confidence and ability to conquer like she
does. Good movie, could have been a better story. I don&#x27;t really know
which age group this story was for in the beginning, but with a title
like that, and the pure adrenaline violence and foul language...It
isn&#x27;t something you would take your 12 year old daughter, or even so to
go see...Strictly adult content.
