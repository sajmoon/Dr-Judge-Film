Kick-Ass is a cool film and even more than cool it tries to be an
excellent movie which is highly commendable especially if you take into
account the dross that makes it to our screens sometimes. It shows that
people who are talented and committed to providing the goods can shine
through. That said what this film lacks is a tone, not knowing what it
wants to be at its core, a teen flick, a spiderman/batman flick, a
comedy, a hard core action, a character study about parenthood? It also
shows in the soundtrack which has a general messiness about it. Having
said all of this, what does work is the characters they are interesting
and involving and the action is brutal, painful and yes sometimes fun!
A film well worth a visit to your local theatre for, go see and
enjoy!!!
