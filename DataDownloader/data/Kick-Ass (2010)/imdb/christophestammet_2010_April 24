2010_April 24 
I just got out of the cinema and I am ... stunned, stupefied, blown
away by this picture which came out of nowhere and rocks everything
away of 2010 so far ( even the admired GhostWriter or ShutterIsland ).<br /><br />The most interesting about the film would be that it came to us and all
I knew was the silly front picture with Kick-ass on it and ... yeah ...
I thought &#x22;What the Hell ???&#x22;. Two days later I was sitting in the
cinema in one of the first screenings with zero expectations and hoped
the film would do what one needs on a Friday evening: To entertain.<br /><br />All I can say: IT DID MORE THAN THAT<br /><br />The first 30 to 40 minutes are a funny introduction into the characters
that don&#x27;t take themselves to serious; mainly Dave Lizewski ( portrayed
by a convincing Aaron Johnson ) who is &#x22;just a regular guy&#x22;. Later we
get to know the best Father-Daughter duo in a long time: Big Daddy ( an
excellent Nicolas Cage ) and *tatatata* HIT-GIRL ( a brilliant
newcomer: Chloe Moretz ). Antagonists are Marc Strong ( who started off
with films like &#x22;Body of Lies&#x22; or &#x22;Stardust&#x22; ) with one of his best
performances yet and a good Christopher Mintz-Plasse to complete the
cast. During this introduction-time the cinematography and atmosphere
simply is one of the best in a long time.<br /><br />After this, the film starts to roll on, the laughs ( every joke sits
perfectly ! ) get a little less and the director shows that he&#x27;s able
to shoot action scenes better than in many action films ( I haven&#x27;t
seen such breath-taking action scenes since The Bourne Ultimatum ).<br /><br />The film is full of small allusions to many other films: like
comic-adaptations ( of course Batman, Spider-man or Superman ), but
also other big, big movies ( like Star Wars, Scarface or Taxi Driver ).<br /><br />If that weren&#x27;t enough, one also has to talk about the soundtrack who
simply kicks ass. A great variety of all different sorts of music (
Prodigy to Morricone to Classical Music ) picked to underline every
single scene perfectly and really setting a mood for all the film. <br /><br />One thing that would still have to be said would be a warning for all
the parents who want to take their 12-year-old comic-loving son to the
film: forget it ! The R-rating is appropriate, VERY appropriate. But
for everyone else, I recommend to see this cinematic surprise, take all
your friends, family, etc.<br /><br />KICK-ASS IS ASS-SOME
