i thought this movie was pretty damned funny. i suppose it might make
some people uptight, but hell, you can&#x27;t please all the people all the
time. this movie will probably please a lot of kids and that&#x27;s what
probably bothers most adults.<br /><br />as twisted as a lot of this gets, and as much as this film parodies
(violence, vigilantism, super heroes, etc.,), it most interesting
element is it&#x27;s statement of child empowerment. this film is good for
kids believe it or not. it teaches kids to stand up for themselves, to
be tough, and to believe in their own empowerment. i&#x27;m not advocating
violence or irresponsible behavior for kids, i&#x27;m just saying it does&#x27;nt
hurt them to have a tough role model now and again. it&#x27;s a very
dangerous world man has created for himself, and kids should be wary,
cautious and tough. you sometimes have to learn to take a stand right
or wrong, and this film is definitely about standing tall and strong.<br /><br />i&#x27;m not a big fan of comic books or super heroes, i used to get into
all that stuff, but i pretty much put it away as i got older. i still
like kid&#x27;s entertainment, i mean it&#x27;s all pretty darn funny, but the
whole super hero thing just seems kind of naive. that&#x27;s what makes this
movie so amusing. it takes on the whole adolescent preoccupation with
super heroes and heroes in general.<br /><br />super hero stuff usually bores me these days. but not this film. it was
funny, satirical, and it was pretty &#x22;kick ass&#x22;. life ain&#x27;t easy, and
it&#x27;s a very hard place. i don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with telling young
people the truth. it&#x27;s a gentle let down and they&#x27;ll get over it. if
you don&#x27;t want to tell them directly, have them watch this movie. it
pretty much says it all, and as soon as they stop laughing and feeling
giddy, they&#x27;ll get the message.
