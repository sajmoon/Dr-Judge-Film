Movies with action? Seen them. Movies with romance? Been there. Movies
with a thick plot? Done that. Movies with twists and turns? Love them.
Movies that a teenager will rave about? ...Not really.<br /><br />But a film that checks the boxes from all of the above and even more
unlisted? Kick-Ass!<br /><br />Sure there are great films out there and what not, but films that have
every ingredient for a true blockbuster are those kinds a films that
hit me deep in the gut (and that is supposed to be meant in a good
way). I can put my mind into a thousand words about this film, but I
wouldn&#x27;t want to spoil it for the ones who are yet to watch this piece
of cinema brilliance! But for all of you who have read this review, you
have a pretty good idea on what my opinion is towards this movie!
Right?
