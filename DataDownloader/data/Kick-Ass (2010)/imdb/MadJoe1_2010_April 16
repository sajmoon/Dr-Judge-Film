Everyone else should ignore this piece of tripe. Now, I know that
there&#x27;s been some controversy(ha!)drummed up about how could these
horrible movie hacks put such language into the mouth of a young girl
and how could they be so irresponsible about the violence blah, blah,
blah. The real problem with &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is that its BORING. Even with
the terrific performers involved, this movie quickly wears out its
welcome by the top of the 2nd act. With regards to how this is a satire
about people&#x27;s need for comic heroes and the social implications of
vigilante justice, look elsewhere. The morons that wrote the comic on
which it is based and the morons that produced the movie version ain&#x27;t
that smart. There in it for one reason folks. MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
