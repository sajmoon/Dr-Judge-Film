I mean did you see the teen movies For the Past 2 Years man , it Sucks
and Really Overrated Just Like Zombieland 8 out of 10 Come on Guys ,
Man I Gave it 4 out of 10 for the Great Effects But this Movie is
another experience ,you get everything a Superhero Movie Should Have
,Realistic Fight Scenes ,Great Effects ,Comedy and My Personal Favorite
Blood Everywhere and Some Bad Language Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong But Without
those things I&#x27;d Give it 6 out of 10<br /><br />The only thing that bugged the hell out of me was the blood. yes there
was a lot of blood but it was obviously FAKE and I think They did that
on purpose For Some Reason<br /><br />Maybe I like it So much Because I Had Very Low Expectations
