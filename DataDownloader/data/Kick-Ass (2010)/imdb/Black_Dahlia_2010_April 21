MMMmmm...NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGAAAAHHHH!!!!!!<br /><br />(Lights cigarette)<br /><br />I want to marry this movie and have its children.<br /><br />I would eat the corn out of this movie&#x27;s s#!t.<br /><br />What would happen if Quentin Tarantino directed Mystery Men and Sergio
Leone directed The Dark Knight and the two films had a baby? I&#x27;m not
sure but Kick-Ass would, erm, kick its ass. Finally Nicholas Cage is
back to form and his hammery is totally intentional and well-placed
here. Finally Christopher Mintz-Plasse&#x27; eternal portrayal of McLovin&#x27;
finds a role it&#x27;s as well-suited for as, well, McLovin&#x27;s. And Chloe
Moretz as Hit Girl not only steals the show but sells it back to its
producers then comes back in the middle of the night and steals it
again, then she comes down your chimney and leaves it on the cookie
plate covered in peanut M&#x26;Ms, bacon, and the creamy white stuff that
fills Twinkies. If Mathilda and Gogo Yubari somehow produced an
offspring, Hit Girl would, ahem, kick its ass.<br /><br />The movie is well-paced with ongoing comic relief, which is much
welcomed between (and during) the numerous action sequences. Amazingly,
each action set piece completely and utterly outdoes the previous one,
whipping the viewer into an emulsion of frenzied froth until the
climax, whence the weak of prostate may actually do so.<br /><br />This may just be the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen (so good that I am going
to watch it again right after I get done typing this), and I&#x27;ve seen
better movies than you have, so it&#x27;s probably the best movie you&#x27;ll
ever see. So stop reading and go see it now.
