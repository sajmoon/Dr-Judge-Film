its a shame that Americans have become so desensitized that we find it
not only OK to have children murdering people in movies, but also
cheering it on. Its really disturbing. I walked out of this movie cause
I was repulsed and felt duped. the advertisements are VERY misleading,
making it seem like children gain confidence and become super heros
standing up for good things. I was way off. Instead its a ten year old
girl killing anything and everything for no reason and doing it in a
bloody and torturous way. Why people enjoy this? I have no idea. The
only crowd I could actually see enjoying this would be the same
Neanderthals that watch that fake wrestling....total insanity if you
ask me. I was just looking around the theater in shock of all the kids
that parents had taken with them and how the most bloody and sadistic
acts didn&#x27;t seem to even phase anyone at all. nothing seems to bother
anyone anymore, not even children. what exactly do you gain from this
movie besides naseau? thinking that its funny and awesome for children
to murder people and to not need a reason....really positive
contribution to Hollywood/slumville. movies have gone WAY down hill.
scared to know what it will be like in 10 years....F
