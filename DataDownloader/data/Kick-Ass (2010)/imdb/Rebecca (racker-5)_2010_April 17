2010_April 17 
I was excited about this movie. I read some of the reviews, saw the
trailer, and was genuinely excited about this film. However,
unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I hardly ever say
this, but I feel like there was too much story and not enough action. I
felt there was too much immaturity in the movie. Granted, it was about
young superheroes, but to me, when a movie has more mature language and
violent scenes, I expect a little more maturity in the plot line.
Kick-Ass&#x27;(the boy&#x27;s) storyline was just not really all that great in my
opinion, especially the &#x22;love&#x22; story part (what a joke). I do
understand that this movie is not to be taken too seriously, but too
much immaturity can be annoying/sickening to sit through. I did like
Hitgirl and Big Daddy, but there wasn&#x27;t enough of them in the film, I
think, to make a big enough impression. While there were some good
moments, overall, the film failed to live up to it&#x27;s potential. Sadness
