The whole idea is pretty cool and innovative, but realization isn&#x27;t
perfect - special effects seems really cheap in some parts and
soundtrack isn&#x27;t really fitting too well most of the time,the whole
story seems very fragmented and rushed and most of the characters -
underdeveloped, the material they have could be easily stretched to
movie three times as long and it shows, psychology isn&#x27;t really there,
they were obviously going for a much lighter than comic books approach,
more family-friendly and main-stream, I guess, however it doesn&#x27;t work
out too well due to massive plot holes on every step and some illogical
or out of character behavior in some parts. Yes, movie is decent and
definitely worth a watch, but it is NOT a masterpiece or &#x22;best&#x22; in any
kind of way some may claim it is. It&#x27;s fun and exciting, but on the
other hand dumb in some parts and kinda forgetful to some point. So may
proclaim is - go see it, but don&#x27;t believe the hype too much.
