What makes this film stand out besides its plot which has maintained
its essence from the comic book narrative, is how the characters got
introduced and developed for this roller coaster ride. There are enough
ups and downs as we follow the protagonist Dave Lizewski aka Kick-Ass
(Aaron Johnson), who decides to take on the vigilante superhero persona
because besides being fodder for bullies, he feels that it&#x27;s time
someone in the big city had the balls to stand up for the little man,
with mask and some special ability of course, which in a way he obtains
through the school of hard knocks for imbeciles, the first incident
which indicates just how straight Vaughn will play the film out without
unnecessary, clich&#xE9; bullshit, which will raise some eyebrows at first,
before you realize and be thankful that clich&#xE9;s are going to be out of
the window.<br /><br />For all his shortcomings, Dave serves up enough pathos almost
equivalent of a cooler Peter Parker, sharing similar concerns and pangs
as a schooling and growing teenager, only without the input of a
radioactive spider. It&#x27;s true when you put on a uniform that it can
compel you to turn into someone else, and watching Dave stumble through
that, with his taser and Eskrima sticks, you can&#x27;t help but to feel for
his character, and to eventually root for him to achieve something
other than Youtube/Myspace glory.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s the &#x22;real deal&#x22; heroes in the film, led by Nicolas Cage in
a Batman lookalike costume. We know Cage had lost out on his
opportunity to play Superman, so his Big Daddy isn&#x27;t that bad after
all, in what I thought was one of his fun, contemporary characters to
date, especially when there&#x27;s a really poignant backstory fleshed out
through superb comic book panels, and tells of why he&#x27;s so dogged in
his pursuit to bring down the villainous drug dealer Frank D&#x27;Amico
(Mark Strong). McLovin&#x27; Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist also
departs from his usual pigeon-holed typecast and gets primed to
showcase a lot more despite his limited screen time, so it&#x27;s quite nice
to see him step out of his comfort zone, and step up to the plate.<br /><br />The one who clearly stole the thunder from everyone though, is Chloe
Moretz&#x27;s role as Hit- Girl, the uber-violent, take no prisoners
vigilante with a foul mouth to go along with her martial arts skills.
Raised under exceptional circumstances, she&#x27;s a would-be assassin from
day one, and owns just about every action sequence that she gets to
flex her muscles in. There hasn&#x27;t been a child character that had
exuded so much caution thrown to the wind, and that&#x27;s what makes her
role refreshing (some parents will frown upon naturally), especially
when her alter-ego is a cute, innocent looking schoolgirl who is
obviously more than meets the eye, and one that comes with a glint of
mischief as well. She&#x27;s the biggest ass-kicker in the film, and she
rocks big time, with the best lines, and the best moves. A definite
favourite who has the potential to seal this film into cult fandom, the
Fannings and the Breslins better sit up and take note!<br /><br />To say anything more of the story will be to give it away, but suffice
to say it also dealt with the modern day apathy, and obsession with
popularity, online hits and virtual friends, where you find no-one
lifting a finger to help a fellow man in need, but plenty of those
standing around the sidelines recording everything for a youtube
upload. It&#x27;s almost anti-superhero in a way with its take on copycat
wannabes who get into an awful lot of needless trouble, and
deglamorizes or even shatters whatever notion that we earthly mortals
will have about powers, to confine it within our dreams. It takes on
the what-ifs, and plays it out in almost realistic terms on the kind of
trouble we would expect, with threats obviously made to loved ones
should secret identities be exposed, and that we&#x27;d really be
psychopaths of sorts if we were to don a costume and start fighting
crime in it, like the characters here who are living our fantasies, on
screen.<br /><br />Fused with great comedic timing and a rocking contemporary soundtack,
my verdict of this film is that this Kick-Ass kicks ass aplenty! Oh,
there&#x27;s a Singapore connection in the film as well, so keep your eyes
peeled when the end credits are rolling. I&#x27;m quite confident this film
will have a placing in my shortlist for the best of the year when the
dust settles. Highly recommended, don&#x27;t miss this, and yeah, the M18
rating means this film gets released here uncut, so kudos to the
distributors for not opting to dumb down the level of violence and
profanity, which will butcher the film badly, and rob it of a layer of
Kick-Ass-ness!
