This film tells the story of an ordinary teenager, Dave Lizewski, who
sets out to become a real-life superhero calling himself Kick-Ass. Dave
gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop
who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D&#x27;Amico, has
trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante
Hit-Girl.Whenever there&#x27;s a lot of hype an buzz around a film, I always
tend to be suspicious. When there&#x27;s so much talk about a film before
its release, that is usually due to extensive marketing and publicity
by the studios and not an indicator of the film&#x27;s quality. In fact,
most of the time, a lot of hype means a shallow and low quality
Hollywood blockbuster (i.e. Avatar).<br /><br />And that&#x27;s precisely the case with Kick-Ass. A somewhat entertaining
film but at the same time extremely flawed.Despite an original premise,
the story couldn&#x27;t be more predictable,it&#x27;s almost insulting in fact.
The dialog isn&#x27;t that great either and most characters are
caricatures.There&#x27;s also an awful lot of over-acting. As a comedy the
film fails miserably, most of the jokes are incredibly plain, simple
and above all, very, very silly and it doesn&#x27;t help that the film
shifts tones constantly. What&#x27;s to enjoy? A few well done action scenes
and some of the interactions between Hit-Girl and her father.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure some people will be offended by the strong language used by
Hit Girl, after all the actress playing the part was only 11 years old
at the time Kick-Ass was being filmed but to be honest, I don&#x27;t think
anything she said is too offensive. In conclusion, the film is decent
enough to be watched until the end but I think it is a very poor effort
and a film you should probably skip. Definitely not worthy of all the
buzz.<br /><br />6/10
