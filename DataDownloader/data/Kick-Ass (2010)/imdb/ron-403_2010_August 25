I was very surprised by this movie and finished wanting to see more.
One of the reasons this movie was such a hit for me was the score...not
the soundtrack with all of the songs, which were also good. But the
score was very powerful and inspirational. I understand one of the
songs was taken from the Sunshine score which was one of the best
scores I&#x27;ve ever listened to.<br /><br />The little girl actress was so much fun to watch, and she pulled off
everything she did. Other than the girl, the cast was really good too.<br /><br />It was fun to see a super hero movie different than many of the others.<br /><br />Looking forward to a sequel.
