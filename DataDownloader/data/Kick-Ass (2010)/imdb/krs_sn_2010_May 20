2010_May 20 
This was easily the worst movie of 2010.What made me very annoyed was
the sight of Child actors some of whom could be as young as 7yrs
spewing obscenities. There were so many Garish costumes and over the
top scenes signified a lack of thought and a complete inability to
direct a movie on the director&#x27;s part. with such an amount of Strange
storyline and Poor direction and Hideous acting I could not for the
life of me understand <br /><br />understand how someone could find this entertaining I also cant
understand how review sites have given this drivel a good rating. I
went to watch the movie in spite of my gut instinct telling me to avoid
it,I did this because of the ratings on rottentomatoes,I wont make this
mistake again.
