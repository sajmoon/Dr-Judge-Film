The best scenes by far involve pint-sized Chloe Moretz in an homage to
Uma Thurman of Kill Bill. In addition to her action scenes, there is
some very funny dialog with her father, played by Nicolas Cage.
Otherwise, it&#x27;s a cute concept and interesting plot, but a lot of the
dialog and acting fall flat. But there are enough exciting action
scenes and moments of cleverness to keep you going through the boring,
silly parts. Seeing a film like this makes you realize how great the
writing was in the Kill Bills, and even in sappy movies like the
Spiderman series. Part of why I saw this film was Christopher
Mintz-Plasse in the cast, because of Superbad. His quirky personality
adds something to the movie, but he&#x27;s kind of wasted here. Here&#x27;s
hoping the sequel will be centered around Chloe Moretz!
