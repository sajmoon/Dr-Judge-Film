After I read the comic book, I was convinced it was almost impossible
to create a mainstream film based on it. The only way such brilliant
comic could work as a movie would be by selling it only on underground
markets.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to pose like a comic book purist, but I got to say that
the original comic book idea was OK: Trying to be a vigilante is a
dirty, damn hard job, and almost not fun. The comic book itself starts
in the toughest part of the work, with KA being beaten to pulp by the
mafia guys... I don&#x27;t like much the extreme graphic violence, but in
the comic book the idea is way right transmitted, since the violence is
that extreme that disgust you until you want to vomit.<br /><br />No; being a kid trying to be a vigilante is a suicide; being a hero
equals being crazy.<br /><br />In the movie the idea is a little less realistic; being a superhero
works way cool, and you can even learn to use backpacks and bazookas in
five minutes. The first half of the movie is kinda truth to the comic
plot and most of the ambient, excluding -of course- the tough parts.<br /><br />In the comic book, the final fight is a gore fest, literally, portrayed
with realism and graphic violence; you can almost feel the terror and
pain of the guys being killed; just like in the real life would be. In
the film, the final fight is a Hollywood action video clip, with almost
no &#x22;victims&#x22; and no actual pain.<br /><br />I&#x27;d say the film picks up the idea of trying to bring justice, I mean,
the original and innocent idea of the Kick-ass character, but it fails
to portray the actual consequences: being beaten to pulp, your
testicles crushed and electrified, more and more pain.<br /><br />Of course, Hollywood would never be able to expose crude reality or
portray kids (in the comic book, they&#x27;re way younger than in the
movies) as being victims -and now, protagonists- of the violence that
impregnates society and entertainment, as school massacres in the USA
had demonstrated lately. Having it turned into an X-Rated movie
wouldn&#x27;t have work either, since adults don&#x27;t watch movies &#x22;with kids
on it&#x22;, while teenagers are the main consumers of entertaining
violence. Kinda hypocrite, I think.<br /><br />The movie is OK if you want to enjoy some action and funny plot (the
movie plot works good for the first half, since it&#x27;s almost totally
ripped-off from the comic book), but at the point Kick-ass flies
(literally) it goes stupid and totally unbelievable, it lose its point.
Watching the movie is not, either, the best way to introduce people
into the Kick-Ass actual message; they&#x27;d watch the movie and forget it
soon, while the comic book gives you more to think about.<br /><br />In conclusion, according to the movie, being a superhero is cool and
easy; according to the comic book, being a superhero is hard and
dangerous and you&#x27;re nuts if you want to be one (just like in real
life).<br /><br />I recommend this movie for fun, but the comic book&#x27;s original idea is
way more thrilling.
