&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; blew me away! Right from the moment I saw the trailer I knew
that I wanted to see this movie. It is easily the best movie I have
seen this year! Not being a big comic book reader for years now, I
didn&#x27;t need to compare the story to the anything. Although I may have
to source the &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; issues to see what I have been missing. I
watch movies for the sheer entertainment value and I was entertained
indeed. Where people tell me that a book &#x22;is a really good read&#x22;,
&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is &#x22;a really good watch&#x22;. The characters were so much fun
and the action was awesome. Chlo&#xEB; Grace Moretz definitely stole the
show. How couldn&#x27;t you love her wit and sarcasm, not to mention the
action scenes? Last year &#x22;Zombieland&#x22; was my runaway favourite for its
quirkiness, originality and fun. It looks like &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; will be it
this year. Hopefully we will see more great stuff from Matthew Vaughn
and Jane Goldman.
