this movie is LAME LAME LAME. I am wondering...is America a bunch of
perverted, sex psycho paths and I am the only one left who appreciates
a good movie with substance and without a load of insulting disgusting
crap. that answer, yes....apparently I am one of the only ones that
didn&#x27;t think this was an &#x22;incredible&#x22; movie. I basically rolled my eyes
and was trying not to upchuck through out it. I would have gotten up
and walked out but I like a challenge so I wanted to see if I could
stand sitting through this whole raunchy, uncreative, unfunny,
classless movie. I made it! barely....I pat myself on the back for
doing so, it was tough. I can only recommend this movie to pubescent,
horny, raunchy, perverted morons that enjoy watching other guys wack
off while they surf porn site &#x22;nipple slip&#x22; (um, grow up please) and
talk about &#x22;TITS&#x22; non stop. I guess one area they did excel was
insulting the female audience and making some of us ladies squirm at
the awkward unnecessary scenes. I think that idiot Eli roth and the
national lampoons directors got together and conjured up something like
this &#x22;ok guys, what can we think of that is degrading, sexist, gross,
and will show the biggest lack of class? hmmmmm&#x22; then they came up with
this stupid movie. If you are a big moron, like movies with no
substance, many sexist and degrading moments in regards to women, enjoy
tit and nipple talk, are a horny pubescent teen who cant get laid other
than rubbing your genitals between a playboy magazine and like watching
guys jerking the turkey, then this is a must see. If you have half a
brain cell then I suggest avoiding F- (and Im being nice) oh and did I
mention LAME?
