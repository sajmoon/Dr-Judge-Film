Wanted to see Kick Ass and after reading some of the reviews about how
shocking it was, I just had to see it for myself. Some reviewers in the
UK concentrated on the Hit Girl character. They seemed to forget she
was character in a movie and there was some moral outrage over her.<br /><br />I like to judge movies for myself and bad reviews don&#x27;t put me off
going to see a movie. I had waited ages to see Kick-Ass, it had been
out for a while but the theatre was packed.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie, exciting, interesting, very original script,
brilliantly executed and also very funny. There were many laugh out
loud moments and many other awesome moments. The actors, mostly
unknown, apart from Nic Cage do a fantastic job.<br /><br />The real star of the show is New York, it provides a perfect backdrop
for the action. Did I mention a cracking soundtrack? Well, it has that
as well.<br /><br />My partner and I both loved the movie and we don&#x27;t often agree on which
movies to see. We left the theatre on a high, both of us being
throughly entertained. There has to be a sequel! For a great night out,
I would recommend this movie.
