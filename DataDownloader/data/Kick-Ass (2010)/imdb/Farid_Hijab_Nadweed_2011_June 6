My brother-in-law was always a big Superman fan, and one day he
mentioned a rumor of a version filmed in coloured wigs. I didn&#x27;t think
much about it at the time, but as Christmas approached I remembered his
remark and wondered if I could actually find a copy to give him. The
internet being what it is, it was simply a matter of spending several
nights checking numerous combinations of keywords on a variety of
search engines until that magic night when there it was! (Things like
this don&#x27;t get sold at Wal-Mart, you know.) I gladly downloaded it, and
a couple weeks later I held in my hands a burnt copy of Kick-Ass. Of
course, they don&#x27;t call it that in India. They just call it Superman,
or whatever the equivalent is in the local dialect.<br /><br />Other incredible scenes include young Superman bending a garden hose to
prove his strength, and a party scene where he breakdances to a Michael
Jackson song! The special effects are excruciating, being a mix of bad
models, nauseating attempts at mimicking flying (two crew members are
visible on the stage in one such scene), and scenes stolen from the
American Superman! I guess U.S. copyright laws don&#x27;t matter much
anymore. Unique to this film, however, are the Superdad girls. I don&#x27;t
know what their names are in the film, but they were wearing Superdad
t-shirts so that&#x27;s what I call them. They are teenage henchmen who know
a few kung fu moves. I mean, they almost know them.<br /><br />If you are ever lucky enough to see this movie, I warn you: you can&#x27;t
be put off by the cheesy special effects or the lame combat sequences.
It&#x27;s the essence of what the movie is about, the basic understanding of
the good which drives the Super Troopers to do the deeds they does for
us on the silver screen, the meaning behind each and every meticulously
selected tree branch which gives this movie its awe-inspiring,
breathtaking quality. I give it three thumbs up.<br /><br />After seeing this film, all I wanted to do was go out and save people&#x27;s
lives, in the style of the great Superman himself... complete with
underwear worn on the outside of my clothes.
