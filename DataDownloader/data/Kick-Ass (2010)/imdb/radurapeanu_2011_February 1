Why did the main character even want to become a superhero? there is no
valid reason for this. Being scared of getting robbed in the parking
lot only supplies a reason for his first try.<br /><br />Furthermore, i think getting stabbed and then blown away by a speeding
car would be the end of anyone.<br /><br />Why is the ex partner helping psycho Cage in something obviously wrong
on all levels.<br /><br />And the ending with the girl happily going to school completely ruins
all the mock-drama of this piece.<br /><br />Wasted time.
