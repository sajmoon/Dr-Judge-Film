For some reason this annoyed me greatly. As a movie it poses a lot and
pretends smarts it hasn&#x27;t earned for itself. The idea to elevate a
comic-book fantasy above comic-book fantasy so it can poke fun at
superhero conventions is a pretension, when all the &#x22;the mayor signals
to us with a light the shape of a gigantic c-ck&#x22; cuteness is played out
Kick-Ass shows us the best movie it knows to be. It pokes fun at the
contrived trauma that creates a vigilante, Dave before a tombstone
saying &#x22;I will avenge you mother&#x22;, then gives us the same for Hit Girl
and Big Daddy in a big slab of backstory thrown at the audience. It
gives us a love interest so bland and worthless as to make Loys Lane
seem like an intriguing character. I don&#x27;t like the type of cutesy
quirky film defined by smug irony but since someone bothered to make
this I want to see it have the strength of its convictions.<br /><br />I want to see a Kick-Ass with the balls to be what it needs to be. Play
cute cheerie music over a scene where a little girl cuts up a bunch of
thugs but don&#x27;t give us a sirupy Big Daddy death. Don&#x27;t give us
b-llocks of realism about an ordinary guy who wears a wetsuit and plays
the part of the superhero to dismal failure, then turn him into a jet
pack flying cartoon by the end. It&#x27;s all very half a##ed to me.
&#x22;Shockingly&#x22; ironic when it needs to make fun of superhero clich&#xE9;s,
then a superhero fantasy where justice is served and the good guy gets
the girl to give us the vicarious fulfillment. Selectively poking fun
at clich&#xE9; then using it as a shorthand for character - there goes
another awkward nerdy guy who can&#x27;t get a girlfriend. Mainly I don&#x27;t
like this because it thinks it&#x27;s smart enough to express itself through
other peoples&#x27; work (I cringed when they randomly used Morricone) yet
forgets to take a long hard look at its own mess.
