I would be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t enjoy this film, because it was
rather entertaining. The featured heroes are not exactly what you would
call &#x22;super&#x22;, but they do manage to get the job done... eventually!
They are actually anti-heroes, so one could say this movie resembles
&#x22;Sin City&#x22; and &#x22;V for Vendetta&#x22; more than it does &#x22;Spiderman&#x22;,
&#x22;Superman&#x22; and other classic heroic films. But the problem is that the
characters are... how to put it... simply too young to be anti-heroes!<br /><br />In my opinion the best description of this film would be &#x22;Dexter&#x27;s
Summer Camp&#x22;... The fact that these &#x22;heroes&#x22; can kill people left and
right without blinking an eye, without feeling any guilt or remorse
simply because their victims were the bad guys, made me think of the
show &#x22;Dexter&#x22;. If the writers of the show decide to follow the books in
season 5, and have Dexter teaching his kids the &#x22;family business&#x22;, then
Astor could be the actual Hit-Girl! This movie shows an 11-year old
girl kill people as if she is playing a video-game, without at any
point considering what she is doing might be wrong. And Kick-Ass
himself doesn&#x27;t think twice before executing a few villains, and is
only concerned about making up the appropriate punch lines. It made me
wonder: were Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth involved in the script?<br /><br />I enjoy watching horror films, I love all of Tarantino&#x27;s work, I have
no problem with violent action, shootouts, vicious fights, even
sadistically brutal murder scenes in movies, but &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; actually
disturbed me! The protagonists seem to lack the basic characteristic of
almost all comic anti-heroes: the notion that even though homicide may
sometimes be an inevitable action they must perform, it is still a most
horrific crime. Showing children commit multiple murders just for the
fun of it, without them ever considering the repercussions of their
actions, is simply wrong.<br /><br />Even so, I believe that most comic book fans will enjoy this movie. One
reason is that it can be argued that &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is progressive, since
it deals with a somewhat different breed of anti-heroes; the ones who
can fight crime, indulge their lust for death, and have fun at the same
time! (Just like in &#x22;Dexter&#x27;s Summer Camp&#x22;)<br /><br />P.S.: My username, CutSickAss, was not inspired in any way by this
movie, it is just a (fitting) coincidence.
