One of the mysteries of modern mass media is why so many otherwise good
films are ruined late in post-production by unnecessary add-ons.
Whether it&#x27;s Lucas throwing in cheesy special effects in a Star Wars
re-release, or sitcom producers putting in laugh tracks, or unnecessary
explanatory dialog, sometimes a producer&#x27;s contempt for his audience
seethes threw and ruins a film.<br /><br />Here, what could have been a reasonable film was destroyed by an almost
constant stream of unnecessary voice-over purporting to give character
motivation and plot explanation. But the character motivation and plot
motivation were already in the film! I don&#x27;t think there has been such
a bad voice-over of an otherwise good film since the theatrical release
of Blade-Runner.<br /><br />There is also excessive profanity in the film.
