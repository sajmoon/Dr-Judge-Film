The hype around Kick-Ass was immense. The delivery of this film was
shocking. There is precious little to review here - every concept
explored in this movie was trite, monotonous and lacking humor.<br /><br />A kid wants to be a super hero, but he has no skills, no strength and
no fancy gadgets. Somehow Nicholas Cage and his teeny-bopper daughter
appear on the scene - armed with Batman-style wizardry and superhero
abilities.<br /><br />The film devolves into a bungling morass of absolute junk. With
Superbad potential, it became an absolute shocker. Do yourselves a
favor and stay home.
