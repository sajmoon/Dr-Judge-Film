Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s apologia to the capitalists and greed merchants who
sell-out the cinema borders on sanctimonious state sanctioned
propaganda, made by an inept puppeteer of emotions. Produced merely to
make train loads of money and sold to meandering and lost U.S. / U.K.
audiences, who humbly crave a place in the world and a pain numbing
drug, ensnarled both by their love of sugar and savvy chic theater
appeal, while their enthusiastic leaders wage war in foreign soils,
this is the continued attempt of Hollywood to enter once again the
politics of the &#x22;I&#x22;.<br /><br />Using the theme of &#x22;courageous moral values&#x22; (much like today&#x27;s
incompetent charismatic leaders), which time and time again is
sequestered by those in power to move the humble masses into
ideological behavior patterns, Howard crafts a narrow look into the
life of a mangy muppet bruiser, whose lack of foresight and
intelligence, makes him both gullible and &#x27;proud&#x27;, a trait possessed by
most of the lower class, --to their detriment.<br /><br />Absolutely devoid of any human interest or articulation, this film is
pure rubbish, created by an &#x22;opium inducing Hollywood&#x22; to forget that
disillusionment brought forth by Christmas and that by the lie which
they force feed to the masses, &#x22;sheer determination and hard work&#x22;,
they&#x27;ll all be better. Well, that is hardly reality, and neither is
this film, it borders on liquid loads of sentimentality, showing
starving families and mole-face children who crave a better life,
hungering for the &#x22;superhero savior&#x22; just around the block, which
itself is a fictitious and disastrous lie. Instead of properly showing
Kick Ass as he is, an exploited and misguided freak without an IQ or
class consciousness, subjugated day one from indoctrination in an
industrial-capitalist world, a mere casualty of an oppressed class,
Vaughn surges him to the role of a saint for the poor and downtrodden.
oh what loyalty to authority! Well, inject sugar into my veins, I can
overcome my own poverty if I merely get into other peoples houses
thereby defying the law. This childish disposition to which Vaughn
indulges us to drink, is nothing but empty and stale air. Vaughn makes
Kick Ass into a kind of pansy man, invulnerable at all to our own
failings, and therefore, inhuman, without fault or blame.<br /><br />Cartoon-like episodes are neither vivid nor distant, and by the end of
this film, we feel like we have watched another worthless re-packaging
of the same indeposable values that the studios. seems to heap upon the
unaware, blind, obedient masses. Instead of actually reading important
books, a trait which is entirely forgotten by U.S. audiences, they want
&#x22;feel good portions&#x22; heaped upon them.<br /><br />This film drips with the adoration of petty values espoused by the
elite classes while they themselves eat well and are mired in their own
hypocrisy. Please, some audience members are not stupid, but most are
sheep, and they will praise this unworthy film, along with others, as
the splendid creation of an artist touched by his evocation of the past
which he has created. Not much substance for this weak stab at the
genre.
