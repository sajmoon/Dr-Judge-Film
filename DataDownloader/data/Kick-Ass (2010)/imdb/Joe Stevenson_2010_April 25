There are few movies out there that just make you want to scream...in a
good way. In all my years I never expected for a movie to come along
like KICK-ASS and knock me on my own ass. There are scenes in this
movie that made me literally grip my belly I was laughing so hard, and
not to say the non-stop action that really makes you want to dress up
as a super hero yourself. All of the actors in this movie did a great
job, especially the lead who did a fantastic job of going from cool
Englishmen in real life to a dorky lil high schooler. And Hit-Girl
definitely stole the show in my opinion. Never have I seen a 13 year
old girl in a movie and think to myself, &#x22;She is totally the coolest
mother f***er in the world.&#x22; I LOVED every last minute of this movie
and you will too! (Unless you hate extensive gore and language, then
you might just completely hate it).
