People have been saying that &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; turns the superhero genre on
its ear. While it&#x27;s true that the set-up adds a certain level of
verisimilitude to the film, the need to have a story turns it into just
another superhero origin story, save for a few throw-away lines and
gags to make it more real. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t fun, however.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is your normal teenager. He&#x27;s a comic
book lover, but that&#x27;s about as far as he goes in terms of being out of
the ordinary. He&#x27;s so normal that he&#x27;s just about invisible. One day he
starts wondering why no one has donned a costume and become a
superhero. If you really think about it, it really shouldn&#x27;t take much.
So Dave buys a wetsuit and becomes Kick-Ass. Before long, he becomes a
phenomenon, inspiring a father/daughter team (Nicholas Cage and Chloe
Moretz), and attracting the attention of a wealthy drug kingpin (Mark
Strong).<br /><br />The best thing that the movie has is its realism. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; tries to
be as realistic as possible in terms of what would happen if a normal
kid tried vigilantism. It&#x27;s not a pretty sight. Dave isn&#x27;t invincible,
and neither are any of the other superheroes; when someone gets hit, it
hurts...a lot! However, I didn&#x27;t think it went far enough. I mean,
wouldn&#x27;t the police be able to track him down with forensic science?
That would lead to some interesting complications.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it&#x27;s still a lot of fun. All the actors perform in an
understated way. I often criticize movies for doing this, but it works
here. Aaron Johnson makes for a good pubescent superhero. His voice
frequently cracks, and so on. But Johnson is a good performer. Nicholas
Cage is a little off-the-wall (as Cage is wont to do), but the
understated way of acting keeps him restrained enough from doing
anything too outlandish. Mark Strong makes for a surprisingly good
villain. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse does what you&#x27;d expect him to:
he&#x27;s like Foegel in &#x22;Superbad&#x22; (his star-making role), only a lot less
geeky and oblivious.<br /><br />There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, and a lot of
that has to do with Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy, aka &#x22;Hit Girl&#x22;
(quite well, by the way). People were shocked at the profanity she
utters. Nothing was said about the people she kills (a number so high
that it would make Ah-nuld blush). Conservatives are always complaining
about how we&#x27;ve lost our moral values. They should check this movie
out, and then see which is more disturbing.<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun (adults only...the film actually gets the
rating it deserves, for once). Nothing is taken too seriously, yet it&#x27;s
never too cheeky, either. However, character development is a little
too low for the film to work completely. Dave is in over his head from
day one, and he knows it. But he needs more development for us to
really feel it. And while the film doesn&#x27;t completely break the mold of
the superhero genre, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a good movie anyway.
