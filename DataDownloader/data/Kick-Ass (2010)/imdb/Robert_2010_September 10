I never saw &#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; in the cinema, I bought it recently on blu-ray
as it is recommended by many. After watching it I had to say &#x22;Damn! Why
did I miss this at the cinema?!&#x22; I love watching films not knowing what
to expect, being surprised and amazed while watching it, and that is
exactly what happened with &#x27;Kick Ass&#x27;. All I really knew about the film
prior to watching was that it is about some douche who becomes deluded
into being a superhero and that it is also pretty violent, there is
much more to it than that. There is also the outrageous black humor, a
crazy mob family, Nic Cage, and one of the most bad-ass characters to
ever have appeared on a screen - an eleven year old girl!<br /><br />&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; (based on the graphic novel), follows the tale of a normal
teenager Dave (Aaron Johnson) who like everyone else exists in a
violent and dangerous world, and wonders why no one wants to be a
superhero. After being mugged by knife wielding thugs, Dave finally
decides to do what others won&#x27;t and becomes a superhero called &#x27;Kick
Ass&#x27; despite having no powers or any kind of training at all. He so
fittingly puts it later in the film &#x22;Just a dick in a wet suit&#x22;. His
first fight against crime (unsurprisingly) doesn&#x27;t go well - he gets
stabbed, run over by a car, and barely survives at the hospital. When
he returns he is still absolutely determined to be a superhero, and
heads out onto the night streets once more, completely blind to how
ridiculous he looks to everyone else. Needless to say his second
venture to help others ends rather well. He accidentally ends up in a
brawl with some crooks and successfully fends them off. The fight gets
filmed by some civilians and is put on YouTube and becomes the most
watched clip on the internet, and Kick Ass instantly becomes famous
across the country.<br /><br />He catches the attention of two other &#x27;superheroes&#x27;, Big Daddy (the
legendary Nic Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) who have a story of
their own. These two unlike Kick Ass mean business&#x85; serious business.
They don&#x27;t just fight crime - they obliterate it! Going against many
superhero trends they kill criminals instead of capturing them, making
Batman look like a fairy queen. It turns out Big Daddy has a vengeful
history with the films villain &#x96; powerful mob boss Frank D&#x27;Amico
(played by the fantastic Mark Strong) and has been training himself and
his daughter Hit Girl to destroy D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s entire crime empire. Kick
Ass manages to land himself right in the middle of this crime war, and
it threatens to doom him and everyone around him, including his budding
love interest Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who thinks he is gay. He discovers
being a superhero isn&#x27;t as cracked up as he thought it would be.<br /><br />The acting is great all round, Aaron Johnson is suitably wimpy and
unforgettable as the titular character. Nic Cage is on fine form as Big
Daddy, being crazy, funny and sympathetic all at once, it&#x27;s a shame he
doesn&#x27;t appear more. Mark is &#x27;Strong&#x27; (hee hee get it?) as the villain,
something that he is becoming quite notable for doing now. While
D&#x27;Amico is a cruel and cunning mob boss he also has a family which
makes him more interesting, and he isn&#x27;t a super villain like in other
superhero films, he is a real world bad guy. The funniest character had
to be D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s nerdy son Chris (Christopher Mintz Plasse) who becomes
another &#x27;superhero&#x27;- Red Mist.<br /><br />However the real star of this film is unquestionably Hit-Girl played by
the delightful Chloe Moretz. This little girl is a MACHINE!! She also
happens to be the source of the films controversy and fame. Never will
you have seen such a young child kill so many adults in a single film
ever, and in such brutal ways. She is also a potty mouth and probably
swears more than any other character, and trust me this film has lots
of swearing! Which begs the question, how is such a brutal and
offensive character so charming? The finale of the film belongs to her
when she raids D&#x27;Amico&#x27;s building, and one of the craziest action
sequences I&#x27;ve ever seen unfolds. She practically becomes the main
character at the end, and Kick Ass became more like the sidekick. You
just want to run up to her and give her a big hug, at the same time you
probably also feel like fleeing from her.<br /><br />Do I have any negative comments about the film? Well actually I do. The
film is a bit too violent for its own good. I&#x27;m amazed this film didn&#x27;t
get an adult rating; it has more swearing than a Tarantino film, a few
unsettling torture and interrogation scenes, and LOTS of blood. As much
as I love Hit-Girl, I have to admit it was a bit disturbing to see such
a young girl wield guns and knives like a pro. I can understand some
critics&#x27; arguments about the film trying to encourage children to be
violent, but the violence is not to be taken seriously. Also I found
Dave&#x27;s two &#x27;friends&#x27; to be quite unlikable, I don&#x27;t know if they were
supposed to be funny, but they came across as irritating and mean.<br /><br />&#x27;Kick Ass&#x27; is a visual treat, and has fantastic pacing, you will never
get bored for a second. The film is really a study of superheroes in
the real world. In our world if someone tried to be a superhero, they
would either be deluded losers like Kick Ass, or extremely violent
vigilantes like Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, which is interesting, however
it doesn&#x27;t show us all this without having a lot of fun. It isn&#x27;t to
everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, but if this is your tea, you&#x27;re going to lap it
up!
