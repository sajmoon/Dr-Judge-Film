I thought this film was so original and highly amusing as well. Every
one should check it out. The themes in the film, although very
adolescent in nature, take on a very macabre meaning for adults and
youngsters alike. The struggles with growing up, the drug-pedaling
gangsters taking lives and the simple meaning of the word family all
come together to remind how easy it is to feel like a nobody in today&#x27;s
society. This film should be the example that prospective filmmakers
follow to ensure they produce good quality, well-written and acted
pieces of brilliance. Cleverly bordering on juvenile and downright
grotesque, Kick-Ass delivers a very poignant message to its audience:
stand up for what you believe in &#x96; and although it doesn&#x27;t contain any
real superheroes, this is easily the best superhero film out there.<br /><br />Having my own personal history of playing with weapons, I can easily
tell you that anyone with a penchant for martial arts (or ass-kicking)
will immediately fall for this little beauty. That said, it&#x27;s not
solely aimed at the fighters amongst you. There&#x27;s a child in it, for
one. An ass-kicking child, but a child nonetheless; one that will
probably shove a heap of wind up your rear pipe if you&#x27;re one of those
people that think children should be wrapped in cotton wool. Or that
children shouldn&#x27;t be commended for fighting or using weaponry. If you
find yourself falling into one of these categories, please stay away
from this production. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the little purple-haired
wonder either &#x96; she&#x27;ll break you&#x85; and the horse you rode in on.
