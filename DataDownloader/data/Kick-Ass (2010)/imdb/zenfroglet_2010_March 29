I went into Kick-Ass with high hopes. While I despise (and am quite
tired of) Mark Millar&#x27;s showboating, self-hype as well as outright
lies, I&#x27;m quite a fan of his work.<br /><br />His two volumes of &#x22;The Ultimates&#x22; comics are perhaps the single
highlight at Marvel Comics (for my sensibilities at least) in the last
decade. Indeed, they are rightfully being used as the inspiration for
the current stock of the &#x22;Marvel Heroes&#x22; (Iron Man/Cap/Hulk/Thor)
films.<br /><br />While Wanted was horribly translated to film, Kick-Ass by all
indications is a more faithful adaption. Probably helped by Millar
producing the affair.<br /><br />That said, Kick-Ass, as has been criticised on many occasions by
various reviewers I&#x27;ve recently read, tries to have its cake and eat
it. It tries to force you to accept that this story takes place in our
real world, and then goes back on this idea and tries to give you
something out of Kill Bill. Pure fantasy fiction. A bit like Millar in
that respect, promising one thing only to give you something else. If
used properly this could be quite surprising and fresh, but
unfortunately it&#x27;s ultimately ineffective here as it just confuses the
tone and theme and left me unsatisfied with the film as a whole.<br /><br />Is it entertaining? For sure! Does it have a decent soundtrack? You
know it! Does it feel fresh? Hmmm, kinda. Is it ***hyper reality insane
bubblegum superhero antics that changes things forever***? Not quite.
There are some seconds where I had thought Millar had elevated comic
book films to a new level...only to lose it a few seconds later.<br /><br />Think of it as Spiderman crossed with Kill Bill. Only less awesome than
that sounds.<br /><br />I&#x27;m interested though, I&#x27;ll look forward to Millar&#x27;s next
efforts/translations. Surely he can only improve? In the meantime, if
you really want a film about what superheroes would be like in real
life, try &#x22;Super&#x22;.
