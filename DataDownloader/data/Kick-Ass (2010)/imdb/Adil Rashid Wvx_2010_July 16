I Gave this movie Ten Because when i just saw the trailer of the movie
i thought man what the hell this is it was blurr but when i saw the
movie everything changed it turns out that its just not a fun movie
about jokes at all it contains some real thinking situations the way
every person acted in this movie is just very good the reason i watched
this movie which i might had not given it a chance was Nicholas cage
and mark strong then who can now forget Mathew Vaughan <br /><br />It is really simple plot movie with real good soundtracks editing
direction and acting good enough to keep you entact movie who doesn&#x27;t
want to be a superhero wants hates the criminals well that convinced
over boy and we got over selves a kick-ass movie and and kick-ass hero
enjoy there is only telling you to convince ya to watch this movie no
story telling it ruins the moment. go ahead enjoy your movie
