Amazing script. Great characters. Re-watchable vibe. Has everything a
great movie should so it&#x27;s sad....<br /><br />I have to say I can&#x27;t understand the point of expletives etc. but when
the little girl (Hit Girl) get&#x27;s in to vulgarity and keeps repeating
those words I have to doc this movie two points. I just could&#x27;t watch
this around kids, or with people because I would never want to leave
that kind of impression on any body. That is the persona of a great
movie. It&#x27;s sad because this just misses. <br /><br />I know young kids will copy off of things in this movie especially if
Hit Girl is saying it and that really degrades somebodies character and
could make a girl feel guilty, or cause problems for parents at school.
If some fine tuning would have been done Kick would have still been in
your face yet respectable. But hey if this director wants to make &#x22;Fast
Food&#x22; style movies that people will just throw in the trash that&#x27;s his
loss.
