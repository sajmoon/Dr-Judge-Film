We are at the dawn of civilization. At the dawn of any civilization
there is an increase of people with mental illnesses. This movie is for
mentally ill people from mentally ill producers. <br /><br />There is a huge silent rage building up. The good, normal people are
silent now but there will be a day when they are not going to take it
anymore. This is how civilizations end -- all parasites that
contributed to moral decay are eliminated so they don&#x27;t corrupt anyone
anymore. The mother of all bubbles, the immorality bubble will burst. <br /><br />This Earth belongs to normal people, who love, raise children, invent
new things and contribute goodness and happiness to the society. There
is no place for leaches and parasites. Yes, those leaches and parasites
that steal innocence from children, remove smiles from peoples eyes and
turn people into materialistic zombies with idiotic giggling and fake
smiles, devoid of any humanity.
