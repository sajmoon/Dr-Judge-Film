High school nobody and avid comic-book fan Dave Lizewski (Aaron
Johnson) decides to stop just reading about super-heroes and begins
living the dream, but with no special powers, zero fighting skills, and
a distinct lack of high tech gadgetry at his disposal, life as a
self-styled crime fighter is harder than he imagined&#x97;particularly when
hunted down by major-league bad-guy Frank D&#x27;Amico (Mark Strong) and
made to feel totally inadequate by the real-deal, crime-fighting duo
Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz).<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the perfect wake-up call for any comic fan who has ever
toyed with the idea of donning a mask and taking to streets in the name
of justice (don&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;ve never imagined yourself in a cool
spandex suit with natty matching cape!); rather than painting the fight
against crime as a glamorous pursuit, the film graphically displays
every ugly detail of life outside of the law and shows what might
easily become of anyone foolhardy enough to take on vicious criminals
without the proper training (eg., entire childhood spent in a monastery
practising martial arts with mystical monks). Brutal stabbings,
cold-blooded shootings, and chilling torture are all shown in
unflinching detail, making the film a genuine eye-opener (especially
for those who might have mistaken this sucker for a light-hearted
action/comedy romp).<br /><br />What is even more surprising than Kick-Ass&#x27;s ultra-violent content, for
me at least, is that it was written, in part, by Jane Goldman, and
directed by Matthew Vaughan, both of whom were also responsible for
Stardust, a film so contrived and cloying that I would dearly love to
erase it from my memory. Here, the pair redeem themselves fully,
providing their audience with just shy of two hours of pure awesomeness
that constantly delights with its witty, thoughtful script, and endless
adrenaline-pumping action scenes (accompanied by a effective score and
killer soundtrack).<br /><br />On top of the remarkable script (based on the comic by Mark Millar) and
flawless direction (love the first person shooter style used during one
scene), the film also benefits from a stand-out cast, all of whom
deliver pitch-perfect performances: Johnson is both likable and
believable as the idealistic teenager who turns his life upside down by
following his dreams; Lyndsy Fonseca is simply mouth-watering as Katie
Deauxma, the object of Dave&#x27;s desire; Nic Cage puts in yet another
seemingly effortless but extremely memorable performance as vengeful
ex-cop turned masked avenger Big Daddy (Cage has a blast in his role,
even mimicking Adam West&#x27;s Batman speech mannerisms); and the amazing
Moretz regularly steals the show with her confident turn as lethal,
11-year old killing machine Hit Girl (if this promising young actress
doesn&#x27;t go on to be a MAJOR star in the future, I&#x27;ll eat my cape!).<br /><br />If, like me, you&#x27;ve grown a little tired of formulaic, big-budget, SFX
packed super-hero flicks, I highly recommend checking out this
alternative take on the genre, &#x27;cos Kick-Ass easily lives up to its
title.
