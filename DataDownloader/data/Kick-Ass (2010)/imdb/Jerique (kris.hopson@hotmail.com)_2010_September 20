This film is not for children. It&#x27;s advertised for kids and it looks
like children would watch it since the plot revolves around normal
people trying to be superheroes. Well, it&#x27;s definitely a film that
shouldn&#x27;t be seen by anyone younger than 18 years old. Chl&#xF6;e Grace
Moretz plays Hit-Girl, an 11 year-old Mindy who kills many, many people
and uses very profane language.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is in the cast and mainly plays the anchor, as Mindy&#x27;s
dad. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about watching a film with Cage attached to the
title, but, I heard rave reviews from friends and read critics views of
it and had to check it out myself. Mostly, I wanted to see Lyndsy
Forseca in a sexier and more body-revealing role. I recognized her name
from playing the future daughter of Ted in How I Met Your Mother.<br /><br />As far as the movie plot goes, it&#x27;s quite interesting and engaging.
It&#x27;s a great premise because I&#x27;ve always thought that anyone could
become a superhero, but no one ever does. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been on
people&#x27;s minds for years. It&#x27;s quite realistic in the way of showing
violence against these &#x22;heroes.&#x22; It&#x27;s great to see that the
screenwriter and director can follow the comic book loyally while
keeping realistic.<br /><br />No one becomes a superhero and has no consequences. Kick-Ass almost
gets killed, Hit-Girl has trauma happen to her, and the realism piles
up. I enjoyed the action sequences and found myself on the edge of my
seat during the climatic battle. I also found myself cheering for Cage
at a moment, which I&#x27;ve never really cared for his characters.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Katie and Dave (Aaron
Johnson). I thought it was quite romantic and I thought the tender
moment in her bedroom was realistic while still being romantic and
funny in a quirky way. It&#x27;s great to see Chl&#xF6;e kick major ass in all
her scenes. I liked the character, regardless of all the killings and
language she uses.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is great comic book movie that is different from all other
comic book movies. It&#x27;s also a very good movie on it&#x27;s own. But I can
only recommend this to audiences over 18 years old.
