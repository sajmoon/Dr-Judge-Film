We&#x27;ve had many comic-book adaptations like, &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22;, &#x22;Hellboy&#x22;,
&#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, and &#x22;Watchmen&#x22;.<br /><br />But in 2010, they released, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;.<br /><br />All I have to say is this, &#x22;This movie was awesome&#x22;.<br /><br />The story is about a kid that become&#x27;s a superhero and teams up with
other heroes to take down a drug lord.<br /><br />The story was great, the acting was great, especially having Nicholas
Cage as Big Daddy, the action scene&#x27;s were great, and the movie was
really funny.<br /><br />Overall, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, is a fun movie and definitely worth watching.
