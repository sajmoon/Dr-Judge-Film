I thought the reviews for this film had promise and decided to go check
it out.<br /><br />Some films are good. Some films are bad and some films are average.<br /><br />This film demonstrates why the &#x27;younger&#x27; generation shouldn&#x27;t be
relegated to the &#x27;bench&#x27;. The acting is absolute quality supported with
some excellent portrayals from cage and strong.<br /><br />Kick-ass manages to describe exactly what is wrong with modern society
without being over the top. It sets out to be fun and manages to stick
to its guns throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Its enjoyable. Fun. Light-hearted and energetic.<br /><br />Absolutely deserves its 8+ rating as one of the most enjoyable films of
all time.
