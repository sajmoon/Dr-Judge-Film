2010_December 6 
This is by far the best movie that i saw in 2010 At first i was
expecting a mediocre stupid movie but when i saw the note score on IMDb
that was up than 8 i think i have to see it maybe its worth of it. Kick
ass tells the story of a student that after seeing injustice transform
himself in a superhero without powers it seems like its a little bored
but after i watch the movie i realize it have most of i need: will,
compassion, action, humor, good storyline, excellent cast and
characters, excellent dialogues and in my opinion no other movie have
all this in 2010. Another point i like to touch is that though i hate
gory movies kick ass have the exact amount of violence to me though
IMDb parental rate have gore 10/10 it isn&#x27;t true for me its 5/10, this
isn&#x27;t saw or an horror movie but the shots and cuts looks a little
realistic thats all besides the micro wave scene there&#x27;s no scene that
show gore and looks sadic. At some point of the movie it will rise your
dreams of be a super-hero like we ever wanted to be<br /><br />WATCH IT IS WORTH OF IT !!! however the film is not for kids i warn
you; through the movie you will find the Strong&#x27;s points of it and
they&#x27;re that it have excellent humor, detailed and excite action
scenes, good humor and besides the 4 or might i say 3 hero&#x27;s will steal
the movie: (kick ass) with his strong will,(hit girl) will steal ours
hearts with her bad-@ss action moves and innocence, (big daddy) will
make us cold with her love for her daughter and for his thirst of
vengeance.<br /><br />If you ever readed a comic book or liked super hero&#x27;s don&#x27;t even think
it GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!! if you haven&#x27;t then you will start to love
hero&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t want to spoil the movie because its too good it make me
remember that i still want to be a hero :)
