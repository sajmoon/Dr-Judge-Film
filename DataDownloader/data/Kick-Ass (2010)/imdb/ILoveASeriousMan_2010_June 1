Let us all Bow down to Matthew Vaughn for what he&#x27;s done here<br /><br />I saw Kick-Ass three times at the cinemas, and that ain&#x27;t enough The
first time I saw it. I went to the Coffee shop to finish the coffee I
had left with them before seeing the film My eyes were wide beyond
belief, I had seen a film with so many great things it felt like more
than one movie.<br /><br />The cast was absolutely ace, every one of them. No doubt Chloe Grace
Moretz steals the show, and lets remember it&#x27;s her talent that makes
this fully work. No doubt the material is great, but she has the
dramatic backbone to hit the beats (even if those beats are saying the
word &#x27;C@nt&#x27;) Nic Cage is a revelation doing an Adam West, Aaron Johnson
slides into the role brilliantly, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse proves
he can be more than just Mclovin showing genuine acting skills and has
a me rooting for him to succeed. Mark Strong is just fantastic as the
bad boss.<br /><br />To be frank when I was in the coffee shop, this film felt so great it
was like it was unfair. But it does exist, it&#x27;s not going to go away,
and as I type this there is already a sequel announced<br /><br />Life has become greater because of it I cannot thank all those involved
enough for it :):):):):):):):)
