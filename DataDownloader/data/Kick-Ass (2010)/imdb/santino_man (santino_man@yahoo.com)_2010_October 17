I coulda&#x27; give this a perfect star rating. The only reason that I
didn&#x27;t is because of movies like Godfather, Inception, and the likes
which most of us know already have 10 stars at the bottom of their
titles.<br /><br />This is entertainment at its best, and it&#x27;s very refreshingly original.
Well I haven&#x27;t read the comics though. I heard they&#x27;re making a sequel.
I sure hope they make a pretty damn good sequel this movie deserves to
get.<br /><br />PRO(s):<br /><br />very original superhero-based storyline comedy and violence blended
well together good casting<br /><br />CON(s): <br /><br />Christopher Mintz-Plasse wasn&#x27;t funny enough (well this is more like a
personal preference, I&#x27;m used to seeing him being crazy-funny most of
the time)
