Not only is this movie ballsy, it really did beat my expectations. It&#x27;s
rare when a movie is way better than the trailer and this movie is just
one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people&#x27;s opinion, on
how this isn&#x27;t a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe
superhero&#x27;s fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is
overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so
entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best
wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero
movies. It&#x27;s been a while since I had some much fun in the theaters, I
was thoroughly entertained. This really isn&#x27;t a superhero movie for
kids, but screw that. I don&#x27;t really care cause this movie was ballsy
and yet very entertaining to watch, plus there is plenty of good movies
for kids out already. Also this movie probably isn&#x27;t going to be the
funniest movie of the year, but those holy crap moments are just so
very cool, you can&#x27;t help but laugh. It really did beat my expectation
on every level and I can&#x27;t wait to watch it again. I am glad the
distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger
audiences, the director Matthew Vaughn has made some good movies in the
past and I sure hope he keeps doing so. The soundtrack was rocking as
well and it fit the scenes it needed to fit in. Nicolas Cage did a
great job with his role as well, it&#x27;s been a while since he was
featured in a great movie that deserves to be seen in theaters and glad
he ain&#x27;t going to waste, he was entertaining to watch as well.<br /><br />8.8/10
