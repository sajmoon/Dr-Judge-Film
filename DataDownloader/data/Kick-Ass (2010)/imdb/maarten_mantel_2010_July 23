2010_July 23 
This movie is worse than cot-death. I felt like dying from the first
second i saw Nichola Cage.. what a lame excuse for a human being. This
poo storm of a movie makes the world worse. Just to think that
something this bad went through so many stages of production without
anyone saying &#x22;hold on for one second, this is really bad!&#x22; made a
little bit of my soul die. Even Helen Keller wouldn&#x27;t of liked this
movie. sigh...<br /><br />Worst movie of 2010 i reckon (so far...) Poor acting, (except for the
little girl),thin predictable plot line, depressingly directed, poor
and unrealistic character development, no allegorical undertones, no
moral message, just a pile of old old old socks. Sigh..<br /><br />A baby with an old Nokia could direct a better movie than this. How can
some people even like this movie. Every word that comes out of the
actors mouths feel overly scripted, banal, boring, mass-market...
Watching this movie is like catching your parents having sex,
disgusting, embarrassing for everyone involved, gross, memory scarring
and kind of depressing. If i was the director i&#x27;d take some time off
and reassess my life.
