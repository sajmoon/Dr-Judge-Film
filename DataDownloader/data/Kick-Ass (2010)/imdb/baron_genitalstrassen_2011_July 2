Matthew Vaughn must have wondered whether he had a fairy godmother when
he finished the top-rated comedy series of 2000&#x27;s to walk
into...well...the top-rated comedy series of the 2010&#x27;s. Talent will
out, that&#x27;s all I can say.<br /><br />First-class observations of civil service practise and government
double-speak, coupled with a stonking cast, made this tale of a
newly-fledged government supernerd who is led a merry dance by his
Machiavellian schoolyard chums, the thinking man&#x27;s comedy of the post
Thatcher years.<br /><br />The idea of a would be superhero isn&#x27;t as ridiculous as it sounds, and
the remit to cut government expenditure is on practically every party
manifesto; but spiderman ever had to deal with a variety of assorted
goonie birds, who became a by-word for a decade, who sees it as his
sworn duty to maintain that paragon of civil service states: the status
quo.<br /><br />As with many Hollywood products, it went on just a tad too long; it&#x27;s
tough, even for the best writers, to come up with red-tape jokes
forever - and &#x27;Kick-Ass&#x27; was definitely a white paper too far - but,
for the first few minutes or so, it was a great show: witty, incisive;
and, above all, *intelligent*.
