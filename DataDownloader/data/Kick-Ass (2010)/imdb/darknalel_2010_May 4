A somewhat unlikely mating of Juno, Kill Bill, and Fight Club culminate
in the ugly duckling brother of Watchmen. The rather cute and bloody
sibling does not disappoint; and it&#x27;s not what one would expect from
trailers and previous movies about superheroes. The movie delivers an
action-packed thrill ride, while breaking the mold of tried and true
action films of past. Kick-Ass gets an &#x27;R&#x27; rating, and though some
scenes seem to pull off an almost Disney- esquire, feel-good vibe, it&#x27;s
not one for the kiddies. But if you can get a baby sitter and silence
your prude inner-self, there&#x27;s one hell of a smart and witty showing,
within this fun, if slightly overcast, film.<br /><br />It begins with the typically troubled geeky-boy character (Aaron
Johnson) finding himself as a superhero, Kick-Ass. In his new line of
work he soon meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl: two &#x27;real deal&#x27; superheroes
very capable and very lethal in what they do. He is drawn into taking
down a New York City Mob-Boss (Mark Strong of Stardust), and struggles
to simultaneously fight crime and keep his normal life in order. On the
way, he also meets Red Mist (McLovin of Superbad), another superhero
who is similarly struggling within his own life. Through the vertigo of
his new life, Kick-Ass soon realizes that he&#x27;s gotten himself deeper
into the crime-fighting business than he ever wanted to be, and in life
or death circumstances is forced to decide whether he wants to be a
normal guy the rest of his life, or become a hero.<br /><br />Director Mathew Vaughn layers sadness, humor, and slightly startling
violence within a story of growing up and taking down bad guys. Based
on the comic book by Mark Miller, the movie carries over some
fascinating cinematography, and exciting ideas. Kick-Ass, for example,
is very in-your-face and brutally physical, and his scenes show it. The
lovable Hit-Girl swears like a sailor and kills like 300&#x27;s Leonidas;
and as kick-ass as she is, she just isn&#x27;t the cute little girl you
somehow want her to be. And Big Daddy, while his SWAT-like movement and
Kung-Fu fighting skills are awe-inspiring, his loving nature still
brings a tear to your eye. All of the components of a typical action
movie are present, but with all new characters and ideas blended
together in a fresh fun take on the classic in this yummy-licious
cut-throat-mocha frappe-jolly eccentric-cino. <br /><br />Kick-Ass leaves a nostalgic, almost melancholy taste in your mouth, and
a longing for the earlier days when time was spent entertaining the
idea of becoming a real-life superhero. It&#x27;s got fantastic style,
showered across fun characters and an engaging story line. This is the
joy ride of the year, careening past inhibitions and breaking through
limits; smiles all around. Though a parody of sorts of the very genre
it assimilates to, Kick-Ass is a surprisingly good addition to the
current superhero movie lineup. If only to compare to other superhero
movies out there (Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man) and to the comic book
days of old, it&#x27;s worth a viewing just to discuss with the mates.
Though not an instant classic, Kick-Ass looks like an abstract art
gallery, sounds like a late-night comedy show, and kills like a
video-game. A
