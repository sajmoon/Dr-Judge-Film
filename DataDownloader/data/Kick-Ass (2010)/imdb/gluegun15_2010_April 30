2010_April 30 
NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with
extremely little knowledge of the Kick-Ass graphic novel. I watched the
movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I
will work some of their thoughts into the review.<br /><br />Another much loved graphic novel has been brought to life in the form
of Kick-Ass, which despite having nothing in common with the Twilight
series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and
craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is
that the Twilight films are generally good and solid films. Kick-Ass,
despite having done a couple things right, is not.<br /><br />As a story, I will admit, Kick-Ass is very catchy and interesting. Now
I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young lad, I would go nuts
over this stuff too. It&#x27;s not just a kid beating up other kids, but
because of the two leads, it&#x27;s one of the best on screen superhero
outings of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that
Kick-Ass boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I&#x27;ve ever
seen. Let&#x27;s not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either.
It&#x27;s one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put
in the category of &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s ALMOST good&#x22;. Yes, I just invented that
category.<br /><br />The &#x27;allure&#x27; of the film appears to be the character played by Chloe
Moretz, who ironically was previously known for her role in &#x22;Bolt&#x22;.
Moretz succeeded there and she more than succeeds again, as he more
than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most
actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be
good looking, but Moretz takes it a step further and makes Hit Girl
very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the
audience. Aaron Johnson is sort of the king of not showing facial
expressions, so he&#x27;s perfect for the role of the awkward teen Dave
Lizewski. However, there were sometimes where his lack of emotion
bothered me.<br /><br />Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Moretz
is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I
can&#x27;t take seriously. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is probably the best as
Red Mist, Dave&#x27;s &#x27;buddy&#x27;, and the antagonistic vibe felt from him adds
a different side to the movie.<br /><br />Okay, I don&#x27;t really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay
to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the
dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There&#x27;s a lot
of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Dave feels like an
awkward teen. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn&#x27;t
bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was,
laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the
electric chemistry between Johnson and Mintz-Plasse.<br /><br />That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this
movie. The chemistry between the characters is amazing. In this
respect, Johnson and Mintz-Plasse are perfectly cast and it makes me
wonder if they could team up together for a sequel in real life some
day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one
scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.<br /><br />As far as these visual effects go, I&#x27;ve seen a few superhero movies in
my day. I&#x27;m going to assume director Matthew Vaughn has seen a few.
Well, he needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly
choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to
successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the
actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as
well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out,
and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the
end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as
well.<br /><br />All in all, with Kick-Ass, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn&#x27;t help
but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the
leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically
one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the
above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie
and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of
the graphic novel, and all of them (5) described the movie as a
&#x27;disappointment&#x27; and that the film went &#x27;half way&#x27; with some subplots,
either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway
through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this
movie, but agreed on one thing: Aaron Johnson was the perfect Kick-Ass.
I&#x27;ll agree with them on all those points and say that Kick-Ass is
exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it&#x27;s ALMOST good.
