Firstly, I must warn you people that this movie is not what you think
it is. It&#x27;s no comedy. It&#x27;s no superhero movie. It&#x27;s just a 2-hour
bull. I don&#x27;t know why was this movie made in the first place. It&#x27;s a
waste of time. Cage is wasted. The boy in tights is wasted. The chick
is wasted.<br /><br />Was it ever funny? Was it ever truly kick-ass? Was it even made for
worldwide audiences? Disastrous movie. I&#x27;m being very very very
generous when I rate it 6 our of a scale of 10. It&#x27;d not even score 6
on a scale or 100.<br /><br />I think the makers were trying to make it a comedy but I guess the
director grandma died and the script lost its humor.<br /><br />The action sequences seem so funny without the intent of being anywhere
close to being funny. The script is damned. Our hero suddenly thinks
he&#x27;s some *man of steel*. Nicholas Cage is a cheap rip-off Batman.
Chloe Moretz is still thinking that it&#x27;s (500) Days Of Summer. Clark
Duke is somewhere between Sex Drive &#x26; its sequel.<br /><br />Most funny of all, the actors are trying to look serious.<br /><br />Movie gone totally wrong.<br /><br />Believe me guys, you must not watch this movie just &#x27;cos it&#x27;s rated so
highly on IMDb. No way in hell, is this movie deserving of even
thinking of.
