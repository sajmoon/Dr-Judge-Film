Next month the first movie of the summer &#x22;Iron Man 2&#x22; arrives. But, if
I may be so bold, the most awesome, thrilling, greatest super-hero
movie of the year is in theaters right now! Sure, &#x22;Iron Man 2&#x22; will
have more CG, bigger explosions and a 200 Million dollar budget; and
you might even leave the theater with a smile on your face. But if
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x27;Batman&#x27; movies have taught us anything, it takes
more than that to make a really awesome superhero movie. And &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
is a really awesome super-hero movie! The movie begins by introducing
us to the central character, Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson: a
slightly nerdy and extremely average high-school student. He likes
comic-books; wishes girls would notice he exists; and, most of all, he
is sick and tired of being mugged every other day and watching
criminals run around doing whatever they want. He wishes crime-fighting
super-heroes existed in the real world; and, hey, why not him? So, he
orders a wetsuit off of E-Bay as a costume and goes out into the
streets to fight crime as Kick-Ass. The problem is, he has no fighting
skills, his only weaponry is a pair on numchucks and a taser-gun, and
his physique is greatly inferior to literally every criminal he comes
across. The only thing he has going in his favor is a higher tolerance
for pain than the average citizen: he is the super-hero equivalent of
that episode of &#x22;The Simpsons&#x22; where Homer becomes a successful boxer
simply because he is able to get punched in the face a lot without it
bothering him.<br /><br />Yet in spite of how bad he is at being a super-hero, he manages to
become a media sensation when footage of him fighting bad-guys gets
posted on Youtube. And this coincides with the arrival of two new
masked crime-fighters, not nearly as famous as Kick-Ass, but infinitely
better crime-fighters: Big Daddy and his 11 year old daughter,
Hit-Girl.<br /><br />These two characters are the heart and soul of this movie. If this
movie is Uma Thurman&#x27;s heart in &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22;, Big Daddy and Hit-Girl
are the syringe full of adrenaline going into it.<br /><br />Big Daddy, played ideally by Nicholas Cage, spends his day as nebbish
cartoonist Damon Macready; but at night, with far from subtle overtones
to Bruce Wayne, he dons a Batman-like suit and uses the millions of
dollars he has acquired from taking down organized crime to buy a
spectacular array of military weaponry. His primary target, local crime
lord, Frank D&#x27;amico.<br /><br />His prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; daughter, Hit-Girl, played by Chloe Moretz, has been
trained since she was five to fight crime giving her the ability to run
on walls, back flip through the air; and shoot guns like Chow-Yun Fat
in a John Woo movie. She also a particular fondness for killing bad
guys with butterfly knives.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t say anymore about the plot of this movie because this is one of
those rare instances where the trailer doesn&#x27;t give too much away; and
I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m gonna ruin that. Suffice to say, that when this
movie kicks into high-gear, you&#x27;re gonna love it.<br /><br />My advice, see this movie soon and try to go when the theater is
packed. Because this is not a movie that you simply watch. This is a
movie that you laugh with, then clap at the screen; and then by the
finale, you are simply yelling things like &#x22;Fuck, Yeah!&#x22; every few
seconds and cheering until after the credits have started rolling.<br /><br />Plus, it ends with a very sweet set-up for a sequel. So, see this now.
Because, if &#x22;Iron Man 2&#x22; is not gonna bring anything new to the table,
I want my sequel to &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;!
