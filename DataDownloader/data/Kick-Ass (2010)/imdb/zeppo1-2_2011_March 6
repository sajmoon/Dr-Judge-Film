Kick Ass is a film desperately looking for an identity. It layers poor
music choices over its action sequences which ruins any suspense or
interest. It isn&#x27;t funny enough to be a black comedy.<br /><br />It isn&#x27;t serious enough, or structured comprehensively, to be a good
action-adventure. It&#x27;s shallow for a teen-self awareness message.
Motivation for some of the main characters are non-existent or
contradictory. There are a few story detours without purpose.<br /><br />The performances of the actors are miss-matched .. a few are terrific,
some are not passable.. The violence is bloody, and at times very
brutal. But it isn&#x27;t a slasher film.<br /><br />If mindless, bloody movies without a point is your thing, then you got
it ... If you can stand dismemberment and knives through hands, and
want to see an 11 year old girl perform theses acts while stealing
scenes, this is your movie ..(which I guess a lot of kids do .. they&#x27;ve
announced Kick-Ass 2 ... )
