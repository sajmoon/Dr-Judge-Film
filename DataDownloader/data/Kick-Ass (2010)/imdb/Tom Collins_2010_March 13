I saw a screening of it the other day and my jaw literally hit the
floor. This film ,in my opinion, butchers Avatar. This comedy is Laugh
out Loud!. This film has a sparkle to it!. I am surprised because I
hated stardust, but i was surprised at how good this film was. For a
comedy the acting was great and I loved seeing Chloe Mortez say &#x22;Cun*&#x22;
but to tell you the truth I just thought Kick as was Kick-ass. It&#x27;s a
roller-coaster ride and I wanna ride it again! I could not believe how
utterly hilarious a film could be. This film Knocks the best of
Superhero films out of there leagues. Seriously if there is a film
better than kick-ass this year it&#x27;ll be Top on the Top 250!<br /><br />Tom Collins
