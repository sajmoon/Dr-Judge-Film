I was very excited to see this movie and I was lucky that I was invited
to a screening of the movie. If I have to describe the movie in one
word: awesome. Not only because of the story, the action and the
soundtrack, but also because the genre of super movie took another
direction and instead of focusing on adult superheroes like Batman,
Spiderman etcetera, you&#x27;ve got now the young and cool Kick-Ass (played
by Aaron Johnson) even without any special powers! Now I forgot one
thing: the acting. That was excellent, and especially Strong and Chloe
Moretz delivered a good job. To keep it brief: go and see the movie
next year in cinemas!
