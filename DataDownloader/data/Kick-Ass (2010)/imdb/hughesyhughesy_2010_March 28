Maybe I&#x27;m getting ahead myself giving it 10 out of 10 . Maybe not
because Kick Ass is one of those movies you can&#x27;t find anything wrong
with .<br /><br />The comedy is top notch , even though it&#x27;s not totally comedy .
Christopher Mintz - Plasse gives the comedy it&#x27;s edge and the humor
element is completed by Nic Cage&#x27;s Adam West rendition and Chloe
Moretz&#x27;s shock comedy factor and last but not least Aaron Johnson&#x27;s
geeky hero . <br /><br />The plot ties in everything tightly with no loose ends , twisting and
turning but not losing you .<br /><br />The action sequences are the best I&#x27;ve seen in a long time , Michael
Bay would be proud of it .<br /><br />The Cast are fantastic too . I was unsure of Nic Cage since he is
usually cheesy and moody , but alas what a surprise .<br /><br />I would highly recommended this movie , it doesn&#x27;t matter if your eight
or one hundred and eight SEE IT .
