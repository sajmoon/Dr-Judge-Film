This movie was just excellent.It had many lessons to teach to people.
one lesson was you only need 20 seconds of courage which was the one
lesson that stood out to me. Also, I thought the acting was outstanding
especially from Colin Ford, Dylan Mee, . Colin does a great job in the
movie of how he is in so much pain of his mother passing by getting
into trouble and overall just being mean to everyone. His father,played
by Matt Damon,decided the family needed a change by moving which helped
out Dylan and Rosie get away from all of the remembrances of their
mother. Dylan(Colin) shows us very well how much he is hating his
lifestyle of his father buying a zoo. Colin and Matt(father and son)
fight all the time with each other and Colin just does an amazing job
as well as Matt of showing us that they pretty much hate each other.
Basically, Colin Ford does an amazing job acting in this movie which
makes me want to watch it over and over again.
