This film, starring Matt Damon, was unequivocally everything I had
hoped it would be. Upon viewing the trailer while waiting to watch The
Muppets, there were tears in my eyes and my heart skipped a beat as I
remembered I wasn&#x27;t watching the film itself, just the preview. <br /><br />The film came out yesterday and to my luck, my mother invited me to go
and see it with her this evening. I was thrilled to see that the music
throughout the film was performed by a favorite Icelandic musician,
J&#xF3;nsi, with a perfect selection of &#x22;Holocene&#x22; from Bon Iver&#x27;s new
album. It was little details such as these that kept me appreciating
the film from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot may have been at times predictable but they were predictions
you wanted to happen; conflict you wanted to be resolved and rain you
wish would stop. Coming into the theater already a Matt Damon fan I was
interested to see how he was going to fill the widowed father role. A
few things a noticed; Matt does look older, he is still as handsome as
ever, and he should stick with a shorter haircut. Aside from my
personal opinion, I think anyone leaving the theater could agree he
played the roll wonderfully. <br /><br />The warmhearted character of adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones, melted my
heart every time she was on the screen. Her character, &#x22;Rosie&#x22; was the
seven year old whose dreams came true; her Dad moved them to a zoo. My
favorite scene is when the Realtor tells Matt Damon&#x27;s character,
&#x22;Benjamin&#x22; that the house they wanted to buy was also a zoo. As
Benjamin stood there dumbfounded, Rosie Jumped up and down as any seven
year old would shouting &#x22;Yay!&#x22;. Seriously, the cutest thing ever.<br /><br />If the cast didn&#x27;t win you over the animals did. Tigers, lions, bears,
snakes, monkeys, owls, otters, peacocks, etc. The list goes on and on.
Each personality portrayed in a relatable way as if you were on the
team helping run the zoo itself.<br /><br />If you and your family are wanting to go see a movie this holiday
season, go and see We Bought A Zoo. It is the perfect film to tug at
your heart strings, leave you with tears in your eyes, and hope in your
heart.
