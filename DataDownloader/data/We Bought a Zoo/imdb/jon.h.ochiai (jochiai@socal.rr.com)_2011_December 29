Sitting on the barn floor with his 14 year-old son Dylan (angst plagued
Colin Ford), who fears taking a chance on a pretty girl Lily (sweet
hearted Elle Fanning), Benjamin Mee (resolute Matt Damon) implores,
&#x22;Sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage&#x85; And I promise
you, something great will come of it.&#x22; Director and Writer Cameron
Crowe&#x27;s &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is about the courage to take a risk and
follow your heart. Matt Damon is powerful and sublime. Crowe wrote the
funny and poignant screenplay with Aline Brosh McKenna (&#x22;The Devil
Wears Prada&#x22;) based on the book by Benjamin Mee. Yes, this is based on
the true story of the Mee family, who bought a home with a zoo in
Southern California. &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is wonderful surprise. I was
touched by its humanity, the authenticity of loss, and the celebration
of life. Colin Ford is amazing as the dour teen Dylan, who transforms--
creating new beginnings and his life.<br /><br />Crowe is poetic in catharsis. Lily asks her cousin zoologist Kelly
(brightly intense Scarlett Johansson), &#x22;If you were to choose: animals
or people?&#x22; The socially clumsy Kelly answers with a beaming smile.
Crowe and McKenna&#x27;s metaphor is about the people we love. Matt Damon is
understatedly bold as widower Benjamin, who veers orthogonally in life
in an attempt to forget the loss of the great love of his life,
Katherine (beautiful Stephanie Szostak), only to be reminded of her in
everything-- including the fate of an ailing tiger. This is not so
far-fetched, and endearingly human. Benjamin can&#x27;t even have lunch with
his older accountant brother Duncan (ironically fostering Thomas Haden
Church) at any restaurant associated with his memories of Katherine.<br /><br />Damon is Benjamin, a fearless adventure newspaper columnist, at the
crossroads of his life. When we first meet him, he is rushing his kids
Rosie (precociously cute Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and Dylan (sullen
Ford) to school. Mom passed away less than a year ago. Rosie doesn&#x27;t
completely grasp the aftermath. Dylan channels his anger and fear in
his macabre Gothic art exemplified in the drawing of propelling bloody
decapitated head in a school display, which gets him expelled. Troubled
Dylan demonstrates genuine talent, albeit clinically disturbing. Dad
prefers Benjamin instead of Ben, which was his Dad&#x27;s distinction. In an
exit scene vaguely reminiscent of Crowe&#x27;s &#x22;Jerry Maguire&#x22;, Benjamin
quits his job. Consequently, the Mee&#x27;s look for a new home. One home
resonates with Benjamin, and it houses an entire zoo. Rosie immediately
falls in love with it. Jones&#x27;s face captures the wondrous enchantment
of a 6 year-old. Here Damon is amazing as he witnesses the joy of
Rosie, and his entire world alters. . Dylan on the other hand thinks
this is crazy&#x97;not what he wants. Crowe reveals his story with ease,
grace and humor.<br /><br />Along with the Zoo, Benjamin inherits the Zoo Staff. Their leader is
impatient and unwavering Kelly Foster (Johansson). If Benjamin chooses
to proceed, they have to prepare for an inspection by July, by the
beyond anal retentive Walter Ferris (comically humorless John Michael
Higgins). Inevitably, this will cost Benjamin his family
inheritance&#x97;something Duncan (Church) vigorously reminds. Honestly,
Kelly can&#x27;t figure whether Benjamin is the na&#xEF;ve savior or the well
intentioned fool? I found Johansson refreshingly strong and no
nonsense. This is the most transparent I&#x27;ve seen her in a role&#x97;it is
awesome. Obviously, she is the possible romantic interest, but she
keeps us guessing. Similarly, Elle Fanning (Dakota&#x27;s younger sister) is
clearly smitten by brooding Dylan, although he is too self-absorbed to
know what&#x27;s up. She is the young soul full of light and life.<br /><br />Damon is the brilliant nexus of &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22;. He embodies powerful
gravitas and grace as a man completing the past and boldly expanding
into the unknown. There is a heart wrenching scene where he argues with
Dylan about the family and Rosie. Benjamin&#x27;s children remind him of the
best in his late wife. And Dylan ironically reminds Benjamin of both
the worst and best of himself. Again, this is not a bad thing&#x97;simply a
human thing. In the eloquent fade away, Damon along with Ford and Jones
touchingly remind us that all it takes is 20 seconds of insane courage.
Life goes on.
