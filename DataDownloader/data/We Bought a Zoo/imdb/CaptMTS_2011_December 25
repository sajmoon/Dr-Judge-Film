We Bought A Zoo highlights the life of a family coping with tragedy
that moves to the countryside to take over a rundown zoo. Getting the
zoo running provides some funny and touching moments, as the zoo
employees and animals serve as entertaining costars.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a solid job as a widow now raising two young kids
alone. His character is unable to move forward after his wife&#x27;s death.
Trying to escape her memory, he transplants his family and takes on a
crazy challenge for which he has no experience. Matt shows good
emotional range, as he learns to adjust to his new challenges.<br /><br />The young actors playing Damon&#x27;s children do a great job. His daughter
is adorable, and she lights up every scene. And, Colin Ford does an
excellent job as a troubled teenager, who feels that he has lost both
of his parents. Damon and Ford do a wonderful job in the fractured
relationship that is central to the film.<br /><br />The supporting characters add warmth to the film. Scarlett Johansen is
good as a dedicated zoo keeper, Thomas Haden Church is funny as Damon&#x27;s
concerned older brother, and Elle Fanning is charming as the teenage
friend. Several other characters, particularly the zoo inspector, added
some fun to the film.<br /><br />Overall, We Bought a Zoo is a heart-warming family film with a good
share of both laughs and touching moments. The film takes us through
the struggles of several characters to a satisfying resolution. The
film is great for all ages and is worth a full-price ticket.
