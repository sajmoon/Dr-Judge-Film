The movie and storyline itself were good. My only complaint is it
appears to be a kid friendly movie from the previews, but is not. Aside
from all the profanity, that is not needed and does not add a
thing...there is one line in the movie that was a completely stupid
move on their part. Benjamin Mee says to his son &#x22;there is a 7 year old
girl in the next room who still believes in the Easter
bunny&#x22;....HELLO?! There was a 7 year old girl next to me (my daughter)
as well as an entire theater of kids who still did too, until coming to
see that movie. Nice move. Why don&#x27;t you just tell them there&#x27;s no
Santa Claus while you&#x27;re at it. Other than that, I do recommend this
movie for adults.
