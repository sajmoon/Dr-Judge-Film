This movie is now my favorite movie. If you have not yet seen it, see
it before it goes out of theaters.At first i didn&#x27;t want to see this
movie. I went because my friends wanted to go. WHen i was watching it i
fell in love. THE movie is AMAZING!!!!!!!! I recommend that everyone
goes out and see this movie.The movie is a light-hearted film about
family.The movie is enjoyable for all ages. THere are great actors and
actresses. Some new and some old. If you love animals I also recommend
this for you. If you are still not sure if you want to see it after you
read the reviews i recommend just seeing it and you will fall in love.<br /><br />GO OUT AND SEE IT!!!!!!
