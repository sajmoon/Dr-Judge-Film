2012_April 4 
After a long time, a movie with the freshness of story which is heart
warming and original. Matt Damon, Scarlet Johansson..in fact all of the
actors have done wonderfully well, of course under the genius guidance
of Director Cameron Crowe. The story has interwoven the emotions
Benjumin&#x27;s family, who is looking for a fresh start from their loss of
mother and wife, with those of team of animal loving persons who are
tending to a lost zoo, and to a certain extent with those of lovely
animals who are part of the zoo. After the initial hiccups, all of them
get together to bring the zoo to life again. Well, you got to watch the
movie to feel the pulse of heart poundings of the main characters in
the story. Go for it!
