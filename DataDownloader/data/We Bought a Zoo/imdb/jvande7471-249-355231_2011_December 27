I really enjoyed this movie. The characters and story line were well
developed.<br /><br />While the overarching story is entertaining, the movie also does a
wonderful job of bringing out the struggles of a recent widower and his
family. From father/son issues to death and dying and moving through it
all. This movie has many heart moments in it that will be sure to touch
you.<br /><br />The acting is very well done, which I&#x27;ve come to expect from Matt Damon
and Scarlett Johansson. Elle Fanning and Colin Ford have wonderful
screen chemistry. Maggie Elizabeth Jones is the cutest and wisest
little girl I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />I left this movie ready to take a road trip to California to visit the
real zoo. A little research later, I found that the real zoo is in
England. I hope to one day be able to visit the Mee&#x27;s.
