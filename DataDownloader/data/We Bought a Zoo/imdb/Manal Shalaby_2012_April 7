Why this movie flopped at the box-office is beyond me! We Bought a Zoo
is one of those movies that make you feel good about life and
everything around you. It follows the true story of a tragedy-stricken
family who search for a new start in an urban property that turns out
to be an endangered zoo. Despite the recent death of his loving wife,
the father (Matt Damon) tires to reconnect with his children and help
them overcome the loss. Not only does he try to save his children, but
also the animals and the zookeepers he suddenly became responsible for.<br /><br />The movie interweaves the three worlds of humans, animals and nature
contriving a universal language of love and faith. It finds hope in the
middle of despair, courage in the middle of fear, and life in the
middle of death. All this brought together in a humorous, light-hearted
way. <br /><br />Everything about this drama is so good-natured and simple: the
performance, the scenery, the music (actually, Jonsi&#x27;s music gave much
soul to the film). Both Damon and Colin Ford excelled in beautifully
portraying the emotionally intense relationship between a caring father
and an estranged son.<br /><br />I guess Cameron Crowe (director of Jerry MaGuire and Almost Famous) has
done it again. Definitely a must-see.
