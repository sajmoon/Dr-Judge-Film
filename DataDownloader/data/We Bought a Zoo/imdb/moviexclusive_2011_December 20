You can&#x27;t get more obvious what your film is about with a title like
&#x27;We Bought a Zoo&#x27;, but fortunately director Cameron Crowe&#x27;s adaptation
of British journalist Benjamin Mee&#x27;s autobiography possesses much more
subtlety and nuance than what its title would suggest. The story of a
grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a rural property
whose 18 acres includes the Rosemoor Animal Park, it is also Crowe&#x27;s
first feature since his 2005 flop &#x27;Elizabethtown&#x27; and the feel-good
family movie represents a welcome return to form for the talented
filmmaker behind such classics like &#x27;Say Anything&#x27; and &#x27;Jerry Maguire&#x27;.<br /><br />Working off a script by &#x27;The Devil Wears Prada&#x27; and &#x27;Morning Glory&#x27;s&#x27;
Aline Brosh McKenna, Crowe grounds the high-concept tale in a heart-
warming story about a lonely widower trying to overcome his grief for
his bereaved wife while attempting to reconnect with his teenage son
Dylan (Colin Ford) and young daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones).
Crowe is better than to take the easy route of mawkish sentimentality;
instead, there is genuine humanity and optimism in his storytelling,
complemented by some outstanding performances that he coaxes from an
ensemble cast- in particular his lead actor Matt Damon.<br /><br />Though the &#x27;Bourne&#x27; trilogy has cemented his reputation as a thinking
man&#x27;s action star, Damon has been and still is a strong dramatic actor.
The astute actor confidently matches the emotional beats that Crowe
chooses for his character every step of the way, from sanguineness at a
change of scenery early on to dismay later on when one thing after
another goes awry. His is a heartfelt performance that packs a powerful
emotional wallop in his understated delivery of a father struggling to
do it right by his children- and nowhere is this more evident than in a
powerful scene where Benjamin and Dylan address their fractured
relationship head-on which is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes.<br /><br />The conviction that Damon brings to his role is a huge reason why the
film achieves its intended poignancy. A scene where his character
finally overcomes his fear of looking at past photographs of his wife
and their happy days together as a family is simple yet moving- and
appropriately filmed in close-ups; while the film&#x27;s last scene where he
reminisces his first encounter with his deceased wife to his children
also works brilliantly thanks to Damon at his earnest best. He also
shares great chemistry with each of his co-stars- whether Scarlett
Johannson&#x27;s perceptive zookeeper Kelly, or Thomas Haden Church&#x27;s wry
older brother Duncan.<br /><br />Both Johannson and Church are also individually outstanding in their
supporting roles, alongside other equally incomparable veterans like
Angus MacFadyen as the groundskeeper with a longstanding grudge for
park inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins) and Patrick Fugit
(who played Crowe&#x27;s alter ego in &#x27;Almost Famous&#x27;) as one of the zoo
staffers with a capuchin monkey perpetually perched on his shoulders.
Crowe has also assembled an impressive teenage cast- Ford brings a raw
edge to his character&#x27;s anger, counterbalanced perfectly by the
ebullient Elle Fanning as Kelly&#x27;s cousin- as well as an impossibly
adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones sure to melt your heart.<br /><br />Aided by an outstanding cast, Crowe drives the narrative along with a
sure confident hand. Alongside the running themes of grief and
parenthood are well-inserted vignettes of Benjamin and his crew&#x27;s
obstacles at getting the zoo up to inspection standards in time for a
grand reopening on the seventh seventh (or the seventh of July)- among
them the escape of the zoo&#x27;s 650-pound grizzly bear Buster, the fate of
the zoo&#x27;s 17-year-old ailing tiger Spar and of course Benjamin&#x27;s
impending bankruptcy (that we admit is over all too soon by a dues ex
machina). Still, there is genuine feeling in every scene, and Crowe&#x27;s
choice of music (a mix of oldies with more contemporary tunes) as well
as J&#xF3;nsi&#x27;s (of Icelandic cult band Sigur R&#xF3;s) eclectic score works
perfectly in complementing the mood of the film. <br /><br />And even though it&#x27;s tinged with sadness, the tone of the film is never
depressing- Crowe making it sure that the film steers clear of both
over-dramatic as well as melodramatic moments. There&#x27;s hope and
affirmation abound in this inspirational tale, and just because its
message of acceptance and reconciliation may sound familiar doesn&#x27;t
mean it is less authentic or touching for that matter. It wears its
heart on its sleeve, but thanks to Crowe&#x27;s deft hand as well as Damon&#x27;s
heartfelt performance, even the cynical will find themselves moved. <br /><br />- www.moviexclusive.com
