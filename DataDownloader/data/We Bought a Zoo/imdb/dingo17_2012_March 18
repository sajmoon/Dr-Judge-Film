I don&#x27;t even know where to start explaining how much I loved this film.
It was simply beautiful and I would definitely recommend it to anybody.
The jokes are funny from the very beginning till the end. Also the
camera work is very interesting and in my opinion nicely compliments
the story. The film surely has it&#x27;s flaws and if you were watching it
to find them you would most likely be successful, but if you just want
to enjoy a beautiful and funny yet deep and meaningful story this is
definitely a film for you. It put a goofy smile on my face at the very
beginning, kept it there the whole time and then didn&#x27;t forget to add a
few tears.
