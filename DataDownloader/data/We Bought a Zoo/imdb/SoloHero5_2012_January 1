We bought a zoo is a great movie to go see with the family. Damon
flaunts his emotional acting abilities with great form but the stage
stealer is young Maggie Elizebeth Jones playing Damon&#x27;s seven year old
daughter. Jones is an eccentric little girl who is bound to bring
laughter and Aww&#x27;s out of you. Elle Fanning does a great job as always;
Tomas Haden Church plays his perfect role, and Scarlett Johansson
levels things out very nicely.<br /><br />If you want a lot of emotion with consistent laughter, We Bought a Zoo
is a great Sunday afternoon choice. Bound to bring tears, smiles and
laughter, with a great true story to back it up.
