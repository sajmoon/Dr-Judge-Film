Matt Damon will surely steal you heart, as he did my ex-lover&#x27;s, in
this Noah&#x27;s Ark tale of good deeds, virtue, triumph, and the
exceedingly sassy vanity of a little girl who should have been severely
lobotomized. Yes, there are plenty of wildebeasts and llamas and
whatnot populating the film, but never for more than a second or two
without a reassuring shot of Matt Damon, herding his elves and egging
them on to the make the most of Christmas and Easter and St. Patrick&#x27;s
Day. Wisely, he dares not shovel manure or fall in love with a horse or
play the harmonica. He is Matt Damon, actor worthy of nothing shy of a
Nobel Peace Prize, for his temperance and triumphant will. He is a
miracle worker, on par with Anne Bancroft, pumping water for dying and
thirsty thespians worldwide. I, for one, cannot wait to kiss his
majesty&#x27;s ring.
