Different yet comforting. There is both humor that is polite and light
instead of over the top dumb which could have easily overwhelmed an
animal movie like this. There is also several deeper dark and intense
dramatic moments both at the beginning that is lightly but effectively
touched on and later between father and son. There aren&#x27;t any really
manipulative story points, but a rather captivating tone of events that
proceed to its conclusion which has a memorable touch about death and
life. It&#x27;s hard to know how much to cut or add in such a movie that it
is easy to point out the absence of much character development of the
supporting cast including both human and animal kind. There is also the
omission of the inclusion of more the laptop photo slides at the
beginning of the movie that would become a key part later in the movie.
Overall, this based on a true story brought out some nice acting scenes
with close ups of Matt Damon as a actor and brought to the screen a
family movie that stood out from the pack of movies this year.
