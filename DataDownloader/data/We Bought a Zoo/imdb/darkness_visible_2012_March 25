You know how delicious it is when you take 10 pounds of sugar, mix it
with a bucket of melted chocolate then swirl in 20 tins of condensed
milk and eat the whole lot washed down with gallon after gallon of high
fructose corn syrup? - when you&#x27;ve finished you&#x27;re thinking &#x22;Mmmm, that
was so refreshing, but what I really fancy now is something SWEET -
what&#x27;s for dessert?&#x22; Take that experience, slap a label on it, and
you&#x27;ve got &#x22;We Bought A Zoo&#x22;. If there were a Scoville scale for
sweetness, this would be the ghost chili of movies. A charm offencive
is one thing, but an all out sadistically calculated ATTACK of
aggressive adorableness is quite another. All of the cast were adorable
and gorgeous, and conveniently paired up with equally adorable and
gorgeous cast members of the opposite sex about the same age - well,
the little girl was paired up with some peacock chicks instead of a
little boy, but you get the idea. Just when you thought it couldn&#x27;t get
any more sweet Cameron Crowe contrived some newer more evilly sweet
situation and injected it directly into your eyes for maximal sensation
of sweetness. To be fair, there were two moments of glimmering hope,
when a bear got loose and then they couldn&#x27;t shut the lion&#x27;s den door -
but instead of having the animals run around and eat all of the cast,
they just had them walk up and down a bit looking proud and noble.
Seeing the performance that was elicited from adorable &#x22;villain&#x22; John
Michael Higgins I suddenly realised what Crowe&#x27;s next directing project
should be - Christmas Pantomime on Blackpool Pier - I think he would
draw out a sensational performance from Widow Twanky, or Buttons or
whoever - in fact the only thing missing from WBAZ were subtitled
audience instructions to shout &#x22;Boo-Hiss&#x22; or &#x22;He&#x27;s behind you!&#x22;. But if
you find yourself right now salivating at the thought of peppermint
cream mixed with caramel, strawberry syrup, white chocolate, agave and
concentrated honey extract then get right over to your local multiplex
and watch We Bought A Zoo - your lust for sweetness shall soon be
slaked!
