Wasn&#x27;t able to suspend my disbelief with this film. It had all the
elements of a total formula film. The troubled, misunderstood teenage
boy. The starry-eyed little girl. The flashbacks of mom. Some of the
conversations regarding mom before she died, etc. The snakes in the
crate was poorly executed IMHO. Ever seen a snake escape from a cage?
They don&#x27;t generally go lay out on the front lawn. Let alone hundreds
of snakes. They all just happened to be lounging on the front lawn?
Kind of silly. Production values were high, as would be expected in a
high-budget film. But overall it just didn&#x27;t flip my switch. Which is
very unfortunate, as I really wanted to like this film.
