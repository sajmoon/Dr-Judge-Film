&#x22;We Bought a Zoo,&#x22; based on the memoir of Benjamin Mee, is a terribly
touching true story of an adventurous man who tries to bring his family
back together and get a fresh start by quiting his job as a journalist,
selling his house and, yes, buying a struggling zoo.<br /><br />If this film were a work of fiction, you might think that it was
produced as nothing more than a vehicle to get Damon, starring here as
the aforementioned Mee, an Oscar nomination and to get the audience in
tears. However, having been based on the real life adventure of Mr.
Mee, the end result leaves you not caring how much was fictionalized
for the Kleenex crowd: if this film doesn&#x27;t touch you, you may just be
dead inside.<br /><br />Although this may not be Damon&#x27;s best performance to date, it is still
one of his strongest, taking on the role of a single father (ack, am I
getting that old that the still hot Damon is now playing a parent?!)
dealing with the death of a wife whom he loves with every fibre of his
being. He shows real acting maturity here as his heartfelt execution of
a dishevelled man trying to deal with an enormous loss and a troubled
son (played with perfection by &#x22;Supernatural&#x22; star Colin Ford), who is
feeling just as lost as his father, may have been overlooked by the
Golden Globes but still has a simmering Oscar buzz going.<br /><br />And not one to be a huge fan of &#x22;cute kid actors,&#x22; relative newcomer
Maggie Elizabeth Jones may be one of the absolutely most adorable child
actors on the face of the planet.<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is the stunning Scarlett Johansson as Kelly
Foster, the zoo-keeper Mee takes on as part of the purchase of the
property, who tries desperately to look somewhat plain yet cannot help
but radiate her absolute beauty even under imperfect hair and a
complete lack of sexy outfits.<br /><br />Director Cameron Crowe (&#x22;Singles,&#x22; &#x22;Jerry Maguire&#x22;) makes a
long-overdue resurgence here with an absolutely beautiful film about
life, loss and, ultimately, hope. I would be hard pressed to deny that
I haven&#x27;t been thinking how I could give that &#x22;20 seconds of courage&#x22; a
shot. And by the teary, heartfelt conclusion of an exceptionally sweet
dramedy, I think you might just be wondering the same thing.
