&#x27;WE BOUGHT A ZOO&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />The best zoo movie ever made and writer / director Cameron Crowe&#x27;s best
movie since &#x27;ALMOST FAMOUS&#x27; in 2000. It&#x27;s Crowe&#x27;s first film since
2005&#x27;s &#x27;ELIZABETHTOWN&#x27; (which was a disappointment for many, including
me) and his first family film ever. It&#x27;s based on the memoir of
Benjamin Mee (who moved in to a closed zoo with his family and reopened
it). Matt Damon stars as Mee and Scarlett Johansson, Thomas Haden
Church, Elle Fanning and Patrick Fugit (William from &#x27;ALMOST FAMOUS&#x27;)
co-star. The screenplay was co-written by Aline Brosh McKenna. All in
all it&#x27;s definitely an inspiring and heart warming film (like all of
Crowe&#x27;s work).<br /><br />When we meet Benjamin Mee he&#x27;s a recently widowed father of two. After
his son Dylan (Colin Ford) gets in trouble at school Benjamin decides
to relocate his family. After looking at several homes he and his
daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), really fall in love with one.
They then learn it&#x27;s the home of a closed zoo (somehow they didn&#x27;t
realize this walking up to it) and whoever moves in to the house takes
on the responsibility of reopening the endangered zoo. The Mee family
bonds with the employees there and really starts to re-bond with each
other as well despite the emotional and financial struggles of trying
to reopen a zoo. Benjamin especially bonds with employee Kelly Foster
(Johansson) and Dylan especially bonds with employee Lilly Miska
(Fanning). Together they all try to work through their hardships.<br /><br />The movie is a little cheesy and corny at times but that&#x27;s to be
expected from a movie geared towards the entire family. Crowe once
again puts his magical touch on the film and really produces a
heartfelt movie. Damon and the rest of the cast are all more than
adequate and the soundtrack is superb (like with all of Crowe&#x27;s films).
If you&#x27;re a fan of Crowe you&#x27;re almost sure to enjoy.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
