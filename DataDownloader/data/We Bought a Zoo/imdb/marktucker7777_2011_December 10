Thank you Cameron Crowe for sharing this amazing story with us. Like
you did with Almost Famous, you found an artful and personal way to
spin a multi-layered narrative in a visually stunning, yet subtle and
approachable fashion. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the father,
securing his rank as the most reliable (and relatable) leading man in
Hollywood over the past 15 years. Add to that a throng of amazing child
actors, a soundtrack that is still buzzing in my head, and a screenplay
which echoes equal parts tenderness, hilarity and truth, and you have
my favorite film so far this year. We Bought a Zoo is a movie all
audiences will enjoy, though some younger audiences may have to cover
their ears for some curse words. <br /><br />Finally, thank you Fox for your series of sneak previews - you wanted
the buzz? Well, the buzz is coming! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
