Maybe you have to be in the mood or have had a similar life experience
or have just been around too many uses of the word &#x27;whatever&#x27; that
spill out all over the place in an attempt to cover up real feelings,
but WE BOUGHT A ZOO is touching. Yes it gets a bit sappy at times, but
so doe life. But in the end if you let yourself go with the flow of
this true story based on Benjamin Mee&#x27;s memoir you will end up feeling
the pleasure of hugs again. Aline Brosh McKenna joined director Cameron
Crowe in adapting the book as a screenplay and it works.<br /><br />Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) has recently lost his wife to cancer. Always
a lover of adventure as in the journalistic form, he sees the newspaper
world crumbling and his life of grieving overbearing and in a bid to
start his life over, and against the advice of his older brother Duncan
(Thomas Haden Church) he follows a new realtor (J.B. Smoove) with his
young daughter Rosie (an absolutely captivating Maggie Elizabeth Jones)
and purchases a large house that has a zoo. Benjamin and Rosie are
delighted, but his young frustrated and failing student son Dylan
(Colin Ford) is not happy about it. The zoo is need of renovation and
Benjamin sets about the work with the head keeper, Kelly (Scarlett
Johansson), and the rest of the zoo staff - MacCready (Angus
MacFadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), Lily (Elle Fanning). But, the zoo
soon runs into financial trouble. The staff must get the zoo back to
it&#x27;s former glory, pass a zoo inspection, and get it back open to the
public.<br /><br />In addition to the challenges of the new adventure of owning a zoo,
Benjamin must face the reality that his deceased wife is to remain only
a sweet memory, must deal with Dylan&#x27;s anti- social behavior and
budding awakening to girls in Lily, must deal with the nauseating
inspector Walter Ferris (John Michael Higgins), and gradually become at
one with his zoo animals and that responsibility as well as his
attraction to Kelly who gives him advice on how to relate to his sullen
son Dylan (&#x22;The secret to talking is listening&#x27;). How it all works out
is expected but endearing.<br /><br />This is a strong cast, well directed, and continues Cameron Crowe&#x27;s
tendency to pluck at the heartstrings. Now is that so bad? Don&#x27;t think
so. <br /><br />Grady Harp
