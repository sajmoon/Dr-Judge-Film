I thought this was a very honest and sensitive exploration of a fathers
relationship with his children after the tragedy of his wife&#x27;s death.
It has moments of sheer trepidation and intense awestruck emotion as
the children and the man himself try and grieve in separate ways.<br /><br />The boys love interest, while banal at times, was very enjoyable.
However given the strength of this subplot i found the animals to take
the passenger seat as Benjamin didn&#x27;t seem to buy the zoo because of
his own connection with the animals but rather due to his daughter,
which made his attempts to keep the zoo rather unconvincing as I could
only see his passion towards his wife under the guise of buying a zoo.<br /><br />I was glad that Scarlett Johansson was not a priority in this film and
instead the family was the core focus of the film. The ending was very
powerful and feel-good and will be well received by those wanting an
inspired and wonderful piece of cinema.
