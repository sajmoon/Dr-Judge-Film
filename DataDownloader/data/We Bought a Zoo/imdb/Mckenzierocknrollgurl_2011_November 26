Saw the sneak preview Saturday. We bought a zoo was simply precious and
amazing. If colin ford or any actor reads this. truly amazing job and
acting. There are awards in the future for this cast.the story was
great. I can&#x27;t wait a whole month to see it again(: best movie in could
watch a thousand times.it made me laugh and it made me cry. Fantastic
movie Matt Damon stole the show along with his movie son Colin ford. He
is amazing I have to admit I was kinda jealous of Elle. Although Elle
was socially awkward in the movie she was also good. I would encourage
any f Family to see this heart warming movie. The whole movie was very
true to the book, it didn&#x27;t down play it at all.
