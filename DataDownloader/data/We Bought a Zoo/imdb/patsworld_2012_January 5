We Bought A Zoo is a heart-warming, fun movie. The casting is a good as
you could wish for and if I had to choose, I&#x27;d pick this as my favorite
Matt Damon film. For anyone who loves animals, and I have to confess
I&#x27;m about head of the line as one of them, this is a marvelous picture
with not only the people personalities shining forth, but so too the
animals. In most cases, we all know that the brief film clips shown
prior to the movie are supposed to be showing the best of the picture.
In this case, that is far from the truth. I almost passed this
delightful movie up because all I could think of was, if this is the
best there is...I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m so glad I opted to see it in
spite of my reservations. Who ever picked the preview clips should be
fired...or retrained, perhaps, because what they went with most
certainly didn&#x27;t do this movie justice. Not even close. It&#x27;s a really
enjoyable movie and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.
