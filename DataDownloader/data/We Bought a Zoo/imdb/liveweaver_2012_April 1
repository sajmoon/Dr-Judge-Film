We Bought A Zoo directed by Cameron Crowe is a true feel good movie.You
do not only feel nicely sedated by its sheer loveliness long after it
ends, but you actually feel good about all of its characters while its
playing unlike some recent films like The Descendants and 50/50 where
you constantly feel bad for their leads as they face their tragedies
that is why this movie feels so fresh and full of joy. You may shed
some tears though this adventure but you just can&#x27;t stop smiling ear to
ear when its playing.<br /><br />The film stars Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee, having a hard time as his
wife died 6 months back.Now a single father of a boy of fourteen Dylan
and a girl of seven Rosie(she&#x27;s so cute that your jaw will hurt
watching her). Frustrated with all the sympathy he&#x27;s still getting Ben
sorry!! Benjamin (Ben was his dad) quits his job and then decides to
move to a zoo after his son gets expelled.That&#x27;s when this lovely
adventure starts.In order to complete this adventure Benjamin have to
find some closure, repair his relationship with his son and above all
bring the sun back into his and their live.<br /><br />I loved the film for its immense and constant likability.A success on
all fronts great acting, lovely story, flawless direction, a great
background score and a happy adventure. You might ask why he bought a
zoo to deal with his problems, well why not!!
