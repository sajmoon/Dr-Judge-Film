This movie had a dozen swear words in it. They even had a little girl
in the movie, about 6 years old utter a foul reference to male genital
that begins with a &#x27;D&#x27;. I had to differentiate which &#x27;D&#x27; word as the
other cuss word that begins with the same letter was used a couple
times also. Along with &#x27;A@#hole&#x27; and a 14 year old boy in the movie
swore a couple times to name just a few instances. We never go out to
the movies because of the price, but we splurged and went this time.
What a waste!! Even the story line was a bit lacking and I thought too
serious for kids. Not at all the lighthearted, fun family film it was
portrayed as in the trailer.
