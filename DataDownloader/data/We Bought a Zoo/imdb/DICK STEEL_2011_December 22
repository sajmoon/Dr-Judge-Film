6 years. It&#x27;s been that long since Cameron Crowe last did a feature
film in Elizabethtown, before taking that long a hiatus and coming back
with a bang this year through his documentary Pearl Jam 20 that
chronicled the life and times of the Seattle based alternative rock
band, and We Bought a Zoo, a family drama filled with all the good
themes necessary for a year end celebration. If you&#x27;re as big a fan as
I am, there&#x27;s always this feel good factor in his films, together with
that whimsical feel and that inevitable touch of romance.<br /><br />You can&#x27;t help but to feel just how cathartic this film could have been
for Crowe himself, who had during this time split from wife and
frequent music film collaborator Nancy Wilson, and short of sounding
like a cheap tabloid, you can feel every bit of his emotion and state
of mind even as we follow single dad Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon), whose
wife Katherine (Stephanie Szostak) had already passed away, and now at
the crossroads of his life where every turn is a hard decision,
especially tasked with raising his kids, moody teenager Dylan (Colin
Ford) and the very much younger daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth
Jones). Priding himself to be an adventurer of sorts thanks to his
journalistic days at being gung ho and a risk taker to get the story he
wants, Benjamin now faces the adventure of his life when an almost
impulse decision to buy a zoo for its compound and house to live in,
led to an expansion of his family to include zookeeping staff, animal
handlers and the animals themselves, thanks to his injection of fresh
funds to keep the zoo alive for just a little wild longer. <br /><br />No you can&#x27;t turn into an instant zookeeping expect after viewing this
film, as the narrative constantly reminds us how primal some predatory
animals can be, the routine experienced by the keepers themselves and
essentially a character and relationship exploration between friends,
would be lovers whether amongst adults or young ones, and that between
family members. Between Benjamin and daughter Rosie, Maggie Elizabeth
Jones will definitely steal your heart as the adorable young one whose
innocence and sprightly nature boosted the first half of the show
thanks to her antics and unbelievable ease and naturalness in front of
the camera, while the focus between father and son Dylan had the
spotlight to resolve in the latter half, with Colin Ford convincing
enough for any parent to want to give him a piece of their mind.<br /><br />After a glamorous three film outing as the spy Jason Bourne and not so
glamorous ones with characters like in The Informant, Matt Damon puts
on a little weight to star as the everyday fatherly figure who at times
have absolutely no clue how to connect with his children, while having
the zoo face pressures in getting the bills paid on time. He does
enough here to show that he can tackle dramatic roles with aplomb,
while Thomas Haden Church supports the role as Benjamin&#x27;s accountant
brother and realist Duncan. Scarlett Johansson tries hard to
deglamorize her sensuousness as the head zookeeper Kelly Foster who
slowly develops a liking for Benjamin in part due to his determination
in not abandoning the zoo&#x27;s revival project midway, with the story
throwing in a little trivial argument over whether to see off aged old
animals humanely, with that theme and plot element of death weighing
heavily in Benjamin&#x27;s inability to let go and coming to terms with his
wife&#x27;s death.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s Elle Fanning starring as Lily Miska, who hangs out in the
zoo and is involved in the romantic subplot with Dylan Mee, a puppy
love if you&#x27;d like that that on one hand didn&#x27;t quite work out its
kinks despite the potential of a clash of system values between small
town girl and big city boy, but on the other showcases enough of her
ability to step out of her famous sister&#x27;s shadow and stand on her own
ground, especially after a fabulous run in Super 8. If anything, We
Bought a Zoo makes you sit up and want to take notice on how Fanning&#x27;s,
Colin Ford&#x27;s and Maggie Elizabeth Jones&#x27; career will continue from this
point, having allowed each to shine in their respective roles here.<br /><br />Like all Cameron Crowe films, the strength lies in the characters, and
We Own a Zoo is no slouch in that department, even if the pacing of the
narrative may seem to puzzle at certain points, and a blip in
characterization most noticeable midway where a serious tiff had
Benjamin abandoning his children and left to their devices for dinner,
which I felt was a major departure from character, even if one may
counter argue he knows that Kelly would be around to see to it that the
children are well taken care of after all. <br /><br />And while Crowe&#x27;s films at times may seem to sprawl, it always has its
moments in the film that will talk and engage you directly with its
nuggets of wisdom. There&#x27;s no shortage of such moments here that will
touch, and will also on the flip side inadvertently seem to bear his
the director&#x27;s own heart and emotions. There&#x27;s a single takeaway that I
thoroughly love involving 20 seconds of courage, and that awesome, tear
inducing finale scene that brings everything full circle with that
coming of terms, that&#x27;s absolutely brilliant in treatment and full of
heart. That scene alone is more than worth the price of an admission
ticket, I kid you not. Coming from a Cameron Crowe fan this film is
naturally recommended.
