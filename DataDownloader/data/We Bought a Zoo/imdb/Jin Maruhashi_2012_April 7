Within the Rosemoor Wildlife Park one can find majestic lions guarding
their domain with royal poise, tigers patrolling their enclosures with
intimidating growls, ostriches frenetically sprinting on their lanky
legs and last but not least- and perhaps the most fascinating sight of
all- a widower (Benjamin Mee- Matt Damon) attempting to mitigate the
irascible growls of his older son (Dylan Mee- Colin Ford) and subdue
his wild urge to sprint away from life&#x27;s hardships all while trying to
uphold a controlled poise for his younger daughter (Rosie Mee- Maggie
Jones). &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is an amiably tamed yet rawly sentimental
dramedy that offers a predominantly mellow panorama of a family that
learns how to reconnect under uncanny circumstances. The film
incorporates a warm-hearted sense of humor and believable acting
displayed especially by Matt Damon, Colin Ford and Scarlett Johansson.
Although &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is far from being a crazed safari ride with
unforeseeable plot twists, in truth it does not need to be. The
familial intricacies and the handful of laughable moments are
sufficient to maintain the attention of a patiently observant audience.
In sum, &#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is a worthwhile and comical visit into the
savage hardships of human life juxtaposed by the appropriately wild
backdrop of a zoo.
