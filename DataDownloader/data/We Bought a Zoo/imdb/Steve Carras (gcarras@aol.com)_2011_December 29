This is year for zoo movies, I guess--Mr.Popper&#x27;s Penguins. The
Zookeeper. This one. Based on a real story in my part of the country,
this had a newcomer to zookeeping (Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee) and his
youngest kid (Maggie Elizabeth Jones as Rosie) attending the place that
they suddenly become a zookeeper-a while after the mother dies. The
aggressive older kid (Colin Ford as Dylan) and zookeeper (Scarlett
Johansen as Kelly Foster), and her younger cousin (Elle Fanning as
Lilly) complete what apparently will be an immediate family, along with
some other people, and they try to reopen an animal zoo while trying to
save as much money, and while the dad tries to get along as a widower.<br /><br />I&#x27;m with poster David Ferguson and others who adore every moment that
7-year old Maggie Elizabeth Jones is on the screen, and unlike some in
the responses forum, I enjoy that Elle Fanning and Scarlett Johansen
were cast.<br /><br />And the seeming surprise entry in the coffee shop is worth it.
