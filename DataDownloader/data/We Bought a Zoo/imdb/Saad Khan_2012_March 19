We Bought a ZOO &#x96; CATCH IT (B) We Bought a Zoo is based upon true story
of Benjamin Mee, a writer who buys a Zoo and moves in with his whole
family. We Bought a Zoo is a Hollywood take on the true story, so as
it&#x27;s a Hollywood take on the story that&#x27;s why we see lots of clich&#xE9;d
Hollywood stereotype situations in it. For example the evil Zoo
examiner, the teen romance and the young girl is pin perfect cute the
way she moves and smiles and say those intelligent lines, It went
little too much. Besides that the tension between father and his teen
son screams Typical. Anyways it isn&#x27;t a big deal as its pretty
entertaining and an enjoyable family movie. Matt Damon, Scarlett
Johansson and Thomas Hayden Church did a decent job. Colin Ford and
Elle Fanning looked cute together plus Colin Ford&#x27;s confrontation scene
with Matt Damon was superb. It brought tears in my eyes. Maggie
Elizabeth Jones is adorable. On the whole, we bought a Zoo is a good
family movie. Enjoy.
