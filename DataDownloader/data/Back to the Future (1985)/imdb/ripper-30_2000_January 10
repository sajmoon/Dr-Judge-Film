This movie has had the single most impact on my life out of any movie to
date. I deem this my all time favorite Movie. It's zanny, hilarious, action
packed, and the single most gratifying movie ever made. The writing is
clever and eternal. Who could forget such memorable quotes as, &quot;What are
you
looking at ButtHead&quot;, &quot;1.21 Gigawatts&quot;, &quot;We're sending you back to the
future&quot;, and &quot;Great Scott&quot;. This is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd at
thier best. Finally a Time Travel movie you didn't feel embarrassed about
seeing. Unfortunatley all good things must come to an end but I'm still
having trouble letting go of this series of movies. I just wish I could go
back in time to 1985 so I could see it in the theater again.
