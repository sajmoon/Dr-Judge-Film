This movie did not do anything for me, seriously, i was too annoyed by
the background music in which the words &#x22;Marty McFly Marty McFly&#x22; were
being echoed during every &#x22;not so high speed&#x22; chase sequence!Michael J.
Fox tried to look ultra cool, but he couldn&#x27;t. Christopher Lloyd was
cool but not properly utilized!Lea Thompson showed some nice legs and
cleavage, but that&#x27;s all from her. She acts like a dead parrot. The
movie is mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the hype.<br /><br />The story is surely interesting, and all actors have performed their
part very well and with all the resources it had &#x96; it was a sure
formula for success!? But a big &#x22;NO&#x22; is the answer. The movie fails to
connect and I felt as if I am viewing a sober re-make of 70-80&#x27;s movie
&#x22;Raj Tilak&#x22;. This is a movie for all students studying Script writing
and Director (in that order). It perfectly shows &#x22;What one should
avoid&#x22; when writing a script and directing a movie. I am 100% sure that
each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script &#x96;
word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on
the screen.<br /><br />But the whole approach is immature &#x96; coming from a veteran director.
The characterization is poor, each scene is like a stand alone scene of
enacted on stage, each single scene is stretched to unbearable limit of
irritation, the music on the over-stretched scene is jarring, the sync
sound is badly recorded, each dialogue is a pick-up from 60-70s pot
boiler, and even with range of emotions given to the characters, all
actors are under-utilized and wasted.<br /><br />A good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on
screen &#x96; is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this
crap.<br /><br />Only saving grace of this movie is the time travel gimmick. But Bill +
Ted bogus and excellent journeys and adventures would be a lot better
time travelling movies.<br /><br />The Fox network show Futurama is vastly better.
