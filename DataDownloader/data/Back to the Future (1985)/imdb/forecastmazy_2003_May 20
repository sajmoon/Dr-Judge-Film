Okay so claiming something the greatest trilogy ever is a huge claim. I'll
admit that, but I'd never have become a film student if it wasn't for Back
To The Future....and that's right, not just Pt1, ALL THREE. Now let me
explain....<br /><br />As a child Back To The Future held my attention like nothing else. Every
second was like a magical moment. I remember very distinctly when I saw
BTTF2 and BTTF3 in the movie theaters; they were two of my greatest
childhood memories. I feel honored that I could even see such great movies
in the theaters. Makes me feel bad about the kids who are gonna have
memories of Jennifer Lopez movies...<br /><br />Marty Mcfly is a kid. He has a crappy family and doesn't know why. He
doesn't have a car and doesn't know why. But he faces everyday troubles
and
hes really not that bad of a guy at the beginning of the movie. Despite
his
parents troubles Marty has grown up fine.<br /><br />Marty however has a friend who's strange but a genius named Doc who
accidentally sends him back to 1955 where he sees his parents grow up? The
small things that the parents do in the long run catch up to them. The
small
decisions in childhood affect their entire futures.<br /><br />As a kid, Marty grew up in the same time as myself and then travels to the
two places you know you always wanted to go as a kid.... the mid 1950s,
The
Future and The Wild West. I mean I know I wanted to, that's why I played
all
three video games. Back To The Future has a nostalgic sense even if you
weren't born in the 80s because it's done so well. The emotions are pretty
much universal, especially for those who grow up in small
towns/suburbia ---
to see what your town was like in the future and the past....wouldn't that
be amazing? ESPECIALLY amazing to see while you're growing up and still
connected to the town (via school, etc...) Each movie in this trilogy has
its own charm. It's hard to pick a favorite (but the first one IS really
the
best. I mean come on; you can't appreciate the changes in time if you
don't
see the first movie.)<br /><br />Now talking about this film on the level of a film student, this film is
amazing. The motifs are done very well, The Mayor, The Clocktower, Doc's
House, Marty's family growing and changing, The Cafe where Marty always
goes
to eat no matter what time it is. There's so many motifs that you only
notice subconsciously unless your looking for them, but THEY are
definitely
there.<br /><br />Any lesser director would have just made up fancy looking things for the
future. Made an old looking set for the past. BUT NO! This combination
does
it right. Returning the same place in different time, you ultimately see
how
time changes things and therefore you see the true cause and effect of
life
through time travel.<br /><br />The underlying concept of the movie - The small things change everything.
Marty's scolds his mother for smoking and drinking so much as a
teenager...and she doesn't grow up to be an ugly alcoholic. Marty makes
his
dad more confident...and he overcomes other challenges in life and isn't a
greasy dork at 40. I mean it's a lot like the cause and effect idea that
the
TV show Quantum Leap uses (and LET ME TELL YOU that show does time travel
sooooo right.)<br /><br />Anyone who says the sequels to Back To The Future sucked, or don't live up
to the first one are just wrong. Their not looking and their judging it
the
wrong way. You can't watch Back To The Future with the judging eye filled
with contempt the jaded pop culture of the now would give you. You must
watch BTTF with the open eye of an awed film go-er. And then you will love
the trilogy.<br /><br />This movie made Robert Zemeckis one of my personal heroes. Bob Gale as
well.
Bob Gale went on the write for Daredevil amongst a few other comics and is
well respected in the comic world and you can clearly see why in this
movie.
IF YOU READ COMIC BOOKS you can see Zemeckis creates shots like in panels.
Gale and Zemeckis seem to click in a unique and perfect way. There's not
one
thing you could change about this series. It's perfect the way it is. I'm
just glad IMDB exists so I could express how much I love this series for
how
great of a movie is. The movie keeps your interest because the subject
matter is great. The movie keeps long lasting appeal because it is well
done
and the motifs are great. IMDB only gives me 1,000 words to express how
great this film is. And that's far too few.<br /><br />If you haven't seen these movies your already in the past.<br /><br />(HA! But I had to throw a cheap pun in there. I mean it is the 80s we're
reflecting on....although this movie doesn't even have any of those. So
maybe I'm behind....)<br /><br />=)
