2010_January 7 
1986 may be the month of July when i was at vacation form my school my
bros brought this film home. For the first time i saw Michael.J.Fox ,
at that time i enjoyed the movie but not that much until when i turned
18 this very same movie was aired on a local channel here in my home
town Lahore-Pakistan. At time i was able to understand the subject
matter of the Hollywood movies better. That was so funny and also
enjoyable watching but imagining your self traveling through time to
same place and location where you belong 30 years backward the time in
which you don&#x27;t even exist. Then suddenly you happen to meet your own
father who is same old you are now (shocking to unbelievable extant)
than ending up inside a home being unconscious lights turns on , a
young lady taking care of you sits in front of you ,you scream and
become speechless because she will give you birth as your own mother.
Meeting than your own grand parents and also meeting especially your
youngest maternal uncle who is just a baby but in the future he will
become a symbol of humiliation for whole family. Michael.J.Fox now
tries to bring closer his parents together , but in a new manner as his
future father is quite a weak personality and under confidant ,his
mother was inside regretting her decision of marrying him ,another
problem is their course met who is after her mother he is kind of jerk
and also want to be dominating as his ancestors. But the most funny
thing is that his mother falls for him (her own future son she does not
know yet). On the other hand i found the most funny but cute character
Christopher Lloyd the man who invented the time machine, he introduces
Michael Fox to the machine(another funny thing , his dog name is
Einstien). My whole family and circle of friends admired it very much
and even it became popular in our country(it was also presented in
theaters in 86-87), some people here were wondering is it possible. In
the future it could be but it demands a lot of energy of solar stars
,BBC once predicted in sci-fi program hosted by X-files Gillian
Anderson But it will take years maybe centuries till then keep on
enjoying and imagining such cute fantasies.
