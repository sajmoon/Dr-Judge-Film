Always a favorite of fans of both comedy and science fiction/adventure
genres, Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future has both the comedy, adventure
and science fiction all into one film. Executive produced by Steven
Spielberg, Back to the Future was among the top grossing films of 1985, and
spawned three sequels with a well remembered Oscar nominated song &quot;Power of
Love&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News. For 17 year old Marty McFly (Michael J.
Fox) his future doesn't seem to be going anywere. He's a slacker at school,
has a few troubles with his girlfriend and has never ending confrontations
with his parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson). For most of his time,
Marty likes to hang around the old eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd)
who has a major surpise, he just invented time machine with a DeLoren
automobile.
Unfortunatly for Marty, he is accidently taken back to the past, 30 years
earlier. For some, time travel might be fun, but from the moment, Marty
steps back to the past, he has a number of problems. First he is nearly
killed by Old Man Peabody (Will Hare) who thinks Marty is some kind of
strange alien, then the people in town don't seem to care for him that much,
he has problems with some of the local tough guys and meets his parents when
they were in high school and his mother is falling in love with Marty. The
only problem now, is that Marty won't be born in the future, if he stays
with his mother and it's up to him to get himself back. I've always liked
this film and the three sequels. It's fun for the entire famly and it's one
of those motion pictures that an audience can't forget.
