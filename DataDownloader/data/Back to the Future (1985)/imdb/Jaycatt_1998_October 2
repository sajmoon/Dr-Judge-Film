1998_October 2 

Simply one of my favorite movies.  I'm a real time travel nut, and this one
starts off the only time travel trilogy out there.  One of Michael J. Fox's
best performances, in my opinion.  Just the right mix of science fiction and
comedy.  Also, a great representation of the 50's from an 80's point of
view.  Watch this movie closely if you plan to watch the other two, there
are a lot of running gags that carry through all three.
