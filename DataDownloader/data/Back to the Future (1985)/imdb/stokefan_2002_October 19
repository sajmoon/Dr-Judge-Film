This film is fantastic, my no1 of all time and surely a film can never
quite
match the sumptuous mix of *actually funny* comedy, great sci-fi
brilliance
and a top plot?! Michael J Fox as Marty McFly has got to be one of the
coolest characters in a film ever, and rewatching this classic never
fails
to amaze! Brilliant 5 * unbeatable!
