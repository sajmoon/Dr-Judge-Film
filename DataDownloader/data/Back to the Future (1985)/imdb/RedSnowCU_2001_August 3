This is one of the great 80's films that has always stayed with me. In
today's post-modern world, I think that it is constantly being dismissed as
a less and less of an innovative movie.  For its time, the simple idea
behind the film meant far more than it does today. The classic parental
notion of &quot;I never did that sort of thing when I was your age&quot; becomes
exploited and the film takes off.  But, like I said, these days films like
this are withering away. It was a post-modern look at the quintessential
decades of modern society (the 50's and 80's). Most of all, though, it is
just a fun movie that I never seem to get tired of.
