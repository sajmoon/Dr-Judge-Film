Back to the future is a great film that always puts me in a good mood. From
start to finish it is excellent with loads of good jokes making it both a
funny and pleasent film to watch. Michael J. Fox is brilliant as Marty, and
the rest of the cast, including Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Crispin
Glover, are just as good, which makes Back to the future an overall gem for
all ages. This film inspired two sequeals, which in terms of quality,
content and humour, are just as good.
