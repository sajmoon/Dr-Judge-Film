This is a movie I have seen a number of times. I'd watch it again.
Anytime. It has something for everyone - romance, action, comedy,
adventure, drama, suspense. It does not lag! Science fiction is not my
first pick for a movie, unless it's REALLY GOOD SCIENCE FICTION, like
the Star Trek movies or any of the THREE Back To The Future movies. In
this movie, our hero (Michael J. Foxx) gets to see how some foolish
decisions work against him and ruin his future. Luckily, he gets the
chance to change those decisions. He also gets to see how following
one's dreams can make for a beautiful future. Strongly recommend. See
the trilogy!
