Zemeckis&#39;s &#39;Back To The Future&#39; trilogy has been a childhood favourite
for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic
state. The 80&#39;s saw a lot of excellent original fun &#39;young&#39; films like
&#39;Back To The Future&#39; (of course), &#39;Better Off Dead&#39;, &#39;Heathers&#39;, &#39;The
Breakfast Club&#39; etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable
then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was
like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well
written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.<br /><br />Back to &#39;Back To The Future&#39;. This one is sheer fun, even today.
There&#39;s an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an
&#39;innocent&#39; film. The music is very effective. It&#39;s slick and follows a
steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick
on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a
very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the
point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it&#39;s brainless
entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes
and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex&#39;s story.<br /><br />The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad
scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with
his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea
Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.<br /><br />&#39;Back To The Future&#39; is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling
classics. It&#39;s over 23 years old and it still hasn&#39;t gotten old. Sadly,
they don&#39;t make it like this these days but then again we always can
revisit them. That&#39;s why they&#39;re classics.
