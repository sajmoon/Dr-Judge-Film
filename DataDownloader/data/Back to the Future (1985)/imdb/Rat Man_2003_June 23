It's so hard to believe that the movie is nearly 20 years-old!. The movie
was ahead of it's time in 1985, and still good today. I wonder what they
thought in 1985 about what 2005 was going to be like.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that is very funny without offending anyone. It
really made fun of the 1950's. The black busboy (future mayor) who wants to
be mayor and clean up the town and the crank white boss says &quot;you can start
by cleaning the floor&quot;. The movie how clean the town was in the 50's and
full service gas stations, but yet the attitudes are so ignorant. And the
mother falling for her future son is totally hilarious. Just the kind of
humor that nobody thought of before.<br /><br />I really think they should do a movie in 2005, where they go back to 1985
and make fun of the 80's.
