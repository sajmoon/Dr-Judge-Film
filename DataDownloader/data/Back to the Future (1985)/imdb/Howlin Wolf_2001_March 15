   One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just
cannot conceive how they could have made this a better
movie.<br /><br />   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can
never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere,
this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining
role.<br /><br />   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea
Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is
just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role
like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in
comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have
helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said
and done he aint the star of the show...<br /><br />   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would
have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with
this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke
and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with
the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this
movie.<br /><br />   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating
escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far
into the future you travel...
