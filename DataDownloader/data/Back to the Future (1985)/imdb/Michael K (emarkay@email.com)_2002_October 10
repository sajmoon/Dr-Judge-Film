Hollywood at it's best....
Pop fluff to take your mind off reality for a few hours.
This is actually a rather good film, script and acting performance; so
simple that the average teenager of the 1980's would recommend it to his
friends, sequels would be cranked out, t-shirts would be made, and a theme
park ride would honor it's legacy.<br /><br />Isn't that what it was (and still is) all about?<br /><br />
