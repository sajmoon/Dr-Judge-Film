Run Marty Run is a euphemism for the loss of Marty&#39;s integrity. Marty
was doing badly in school and doc did not know what to do about it.
Especially in math class, Marty was doing very badly. And doc loved
Marty and did not know what to do about it. So he created the time
machine so that Marty would learn how to count better and he did not
want to hurt Marty&#39;s feelings by telling him that he knew how badly he
was doing in math class. Doc had covert intelligence reports on how
Marty was doing in school. So the time machine was just a way to teach
Marty how to count better without hurting Marty&#39;s feelings. &quot;Run Marty
Run!!!&quot; is supposed to become colloquial English for when somebody has
done something wrong.
