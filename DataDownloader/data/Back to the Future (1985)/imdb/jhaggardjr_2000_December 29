&quot;Back to the Future&quot; was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a
teenager. It's a funny, exciting sci-fi/fantasy/comedy that today is still
perfect for all ages. Michael J. Fox stars in his best film role as a
teenager in 1985 who goes back in time 30 years earlier to 1955 in a
DeLorean time machine and in the process meets his parents (Lea Thompson and
Crispin Glover) while they're teenagers. He also catches up with his mad
scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) who built the time machine and tries to
help Fox find a way to get him back to the present day. Director Robert
Zemeckis made &quot;Back to the Future&quot; a winning film all the way around. Fox is
terrific here. So are Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. The writing (by Zemeckis
and Bob Gale) is fresh and original, the directing outstanding, and the
technical elements (ranging from the terrific production design to the
rousing music score to the superb special effects) are dazzling. &quot;Back to
the Future&quot; was a great '80s movie, and one of the decades biggest smash
hits. Also a big asset, an awesome soundtrack featuring two great songs sung
by Huey Lewis just for this movie (&quot;Back in Time&quot; and the Oscar-nominated
&quot;Power of Love&quot;). The two sequels that followed simultaneously in 1989 and
1990 failed to live up to this one. In this trilogy, the original &quot;Back to
the Future&quot; is the only one worth seeing.<br /><br />**** (out of four)
