Back to the Future is everything a film can attain to - clean,<br /><br />wholesome, and yet drags in that audience that prefers violence<br /><br />and profanity in their repretoir.  Just the fact that a highschool boy<br /><br />can have such an intimate relationship with an old scientist<br /><br />(non-sexual, of course!) is worth seeing.  
&quot;Marty, meet me at the old mall.  I want to show you my time<br /><br />machine, made out of a Delorean.&quot;  Not an exact quote, but if it<br /><br />ever happened to me I'd be goin' places too!
