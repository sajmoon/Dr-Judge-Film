&#x27;Back to the Future&#x27; is Absolute Entertainment! An engaging, funny,
lively &#x26; arresting film, that, in many ways, is Time-Less! Easily,
Amongst The Finest Science-Fiction/Adventure films to date.<br /><br />&#x27;Back to the Future&#x27; tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is
accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955. He meets his future
parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother&#x27;s
romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing
his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr.
Emmett &#x22;Doc&#x22; Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985. <br /><br />A Terrific idea, translates into a Terrific Film. Robert Zemeckis &#x26; Bob
Gale&#x27;s Screenplay is so engaging, lively &#x26; fast-paced, that, it holds
your attention from start to end. Also, the entire track of the bad guy
Biff, is superbly handled. Zemeckis Directs this Terrific Film, with
style. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is razor-sharp. Art Design is
fantastic. Special Effects are neat. <br /><br />Performance-Wise: Michael J. Fox immortalizes Marty McFly, with his
impeccable performance in here. The Immensely Talented Actor looks the
part to the T, and is lovable throughout. Christopher Lloyd plays Dr.
Emmett &#x22;Doc&#x22; Brown, remarkably. Crispin Glover is outstanding as George
McFly. Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly, is very good. Thomas F.
Wilson as Biff, is convincing.<br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;Back to the Future&#x27; rocks! A Highly-Entertaining Film,
that shouldn&#x27;t be missed by cinema fans. Two Thumbs Up!
