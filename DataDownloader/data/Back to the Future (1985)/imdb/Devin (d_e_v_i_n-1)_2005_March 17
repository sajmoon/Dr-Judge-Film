I love this movie (the entire trilogy), its right up there with Indiana
Jones, Lethal Weapon, Jurassic Park, Die Hard and Star Wars! <br /><br />It's just another day here at Hill Valley in good IL' 1985... the local
kids are aspiring to rock n' roll stardom in vain, the local crackpot
scientist is up to his neck in his self-inflicted hair-brained schemes,
and the pecking order is still well and truly the same as it always has
been since the birth of this town. However, nobody ever expected that
future history was in the making when Saturday October 26 rolled around
... 1:20pm to be exact. Marty McFly is asked by close friend Doc Emmett
Brown to meet him at the local shopping precinct known as Twin Pines
Mall. Marty then sees Doc's new custom-built version of an already rare
vehicle called the &quot;DeLorean&quot; with a few special add-ons. Before Marty
knows what's about to hit him Doc places his unsuspecting pet dog
'Einstein' into the DeLorean, hits the remote control and cranks the
sucker up to 88mph whereby it unbelievably disappears right in front of
them with only a pair of fire-trails skimming past between their legs.
The Doc is impressed but Marty is basically a nervous wreck when
exactly a minute later the Delorean explodes back to reality. The Doc
then reveals what he has achieved by this experiment, but an
unpredictable event transpires whereby Marty is catapulted back to
1955. He soon discovers that his actions and interactions with everyone
around him will have serious repercussions if things are not set back
to what they once were.<br /><br />Well, you have to see this movie and in my opinion its a must buy!
