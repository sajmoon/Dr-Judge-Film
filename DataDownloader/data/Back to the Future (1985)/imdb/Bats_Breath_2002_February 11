One thing about teenagers----they can't EVER imagine their own parents were
teenagers.  Children maybey, but not teenagers.  Hell they usually forget
their older brothers and cousins were teenagers too.  One of the universal
truths about being a teenager is that you always think you and people close
to your age where the first teens to EVER exist on planet Earth.  Teens
always believe that what they are going through is so different from
anything anyone else ever went through.  The reality is that 98% of what
teens go through, EVERYONE before them went through as well.  Remember the
16, 17 year olds complaining and moaning about how they are different and
misunderstood during the Columbine shootings in 1999?  Well they're 20 years
old now in 2002, or will be 20 later this year.  So they can't complain
about anything anymore.  So why did they complain about being misunderstood?
 Perhaps now they're adults that are misunderstood? j/king ;) <br /><br />In &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, a typical 17 year old from 1985 is just, well a
teenager.  Marty McFly is always late for class, he likes to hang out with
his girlfriend at the mall, he's absorbed into his heavy metal music and he
doesn't really know too much about what happened in the world more then 4 or
5 years ago.  Marty is self absorbed, but very hip and resourceful.  He's
also confident and street smart.  On the other hand, his father George McFly
is a complete loser.  George is 47 years old and constantly being bullied by
his mean boss Biff Tannen.  Marty's mother Lorraine is an overweight
alcoholic, and his two older siblings are 20 something losers like their
parents.<br /><br />In BTTF, through a series of strange events, Marty accidently travels back
to 1955 and meets his own parents as----gasp---teenagers!!!  And while they
may not have the technology, fashion and music that Marty has in 1985, they
are teenagers just like him.  They are going through the same trials and
tribulations of being a teen that Marty is in 1985.  And like typical teens,
they think they are the coolest teens to ever exist on planet Earth.  At the
end of the film, Marty says it's been &quot;educational&quot; and has been for the
audience as well. <br /><br />By the way I'm not that &quot;old&quot; myself, I'm only 26, but I get sick of
teenagers always acting like they are so different and cooler because of the
superior technology they have grown up with.  But that's part of being a
teen. I have to remind myself that back in the early and mid '90s we
teenagers acted and complained about nearly all the same stupid stuff the
teens today complain about.  I thought and acted exactly like they did until
about 1995 or 1996.....something strange happened to me then, I entered my
20s and became an adult, and I had no more excuses to complain about being
&quot;misunderstood&quot;. :)
