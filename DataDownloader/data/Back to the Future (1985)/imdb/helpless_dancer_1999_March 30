Here is a very well done movie about time travel. It has it all. I
especially liked the time machine itself - a Delorean car. The story was
perfectly written with witty dialogue and never ending excitement. Each
scene fit snugly into the one preceding and following it. Michael Fox
carried this one all the way. 5 stars.
