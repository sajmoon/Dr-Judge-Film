25 years on, and back to the future is still seen as one of the best
films to ever exist. And i completely agree, because this film is a
masterpiece - yes i said it a MASTERPIECE!!! so is it as good as
everyone says, oh undeniably , but just what makes it so dam good? well
they have that catchy and nostalgic theme tune that just brings a smile
on my face every time i hear it. They have the wonderful duo of
Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox who are just hilarious together on
screen, and then of course is the story.<br /><br />To keep this really short and not spoil anything for those who have not
(and should) seen this, the story is about a Young teenager Marty Mcfly
( Micheal J. Fox), who accidentally gets sent back to the past in the
year 1955. he travels back in time in a delorean invented by the
brilliant Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd). Marty must somehow find a way
to get back to the year 1985 and try not to change the past for the
worst. that is all i am willing to say because this really is a film
you must see without not knowing whats going to happen.<br /><br />I think my 2 favourite characters have to be the villain of the movie
Biff ( played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson) and Lorraine Baines (
played by the beautiful Lea Thompson). I Love Biff just because of how
big a prick he can be but still funny and charming at the same time. I
can guarantee that once you have seen this movie Biff Tannen will be on
your personal list of favourite bad guys , because he&#x27;s high up on the
list on mine . I also love the innocent and sweet Lorraine Baines
because.......well, because shes so gorgeous , absolutely stunning. i
really like the character but in all honesty, iv always had a thing for
Lea Thompson so thats probably why i like that character so god dam
much haha.<br /><br />So if you are unfortunate enough to have not seen this epic masterpiece
then i advise you do. Robert Zemicks and Steven Spielberg have created
a franchise that leaves a warm and happy feeling in the hearts of the
viewers, which never leaves. The sequels are both just as good , as
back to the future isn&#x27;t just the perfect movie, its the perfect first
chapter, to a perfect trilogy.<br /><br />By Scott Dewhurst
