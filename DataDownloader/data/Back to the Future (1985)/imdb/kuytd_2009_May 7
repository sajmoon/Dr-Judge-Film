I first caught Back To The Future when i was very young, one Christmas
at home. I was only born in 81, so i was hooked from early childhood.<br /><br />I have to say that i never have got bored of this film, no matter how
many old VHS tapes i wore out through watching. With the sound off i
could tell you every word, and hum along to every tune.<br /><br />The combination of Lloyd and Michael J Fox is inspired, with the
youthful cheek of Marty and the crazy flare of the Doc. Every scene is
full of rich acting, maybe not the heavy Oscar winning performances,
but i think better, in that it just feels real. I will never get tired
of how Fox can act so naturally.<br /><br />Another element for me is the iconic Delorean, being a car fan i think
its a great choice, and at about 5 years old it just looks amazing! I
have read one of the early release scripts from about 84, where the
Delorean was going to be an RV, and the Doc was a womaniser. I&#x27;m very
glad it did not come out that way.<br /><br />It is also one of just a few films unspoiled by its sequels, even if II
did loose a little in story depth, III helps to just bring them all
together.<br /><br />Just thinking about it now, I think i&#x27;ll have to break out the DVD box
set.
