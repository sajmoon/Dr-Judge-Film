I don&#39;t care what anybody says...<br /><br />I love this film.<br /><br />I have watched it more than 80 times, and I still love.<br /><br />From the story, to the setting, the music, the effects, the casting,
the makeup, costumes, set design---everything.<br /><br />This is the BEST movie EVER made.<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen a lot...I like a lot...but nothing tops this...not now, not
then, not before this was released at theaters.<br /><br />The entire crew - cast, - extras and everybody involved should be
rewarded very handsomely for this...and the following sequels.<br /><br />There may be some flaws in the story...but I love it.<br /><br />There has not been one time when this was on screen that I ever
switched it to something else.<br /><br />Nothing else comes close. As far as I&#39;m concerned...nothing ever will.<br /><br />I am so impressed with this movie that I don&#39;t even know how to end
this comment aside of to state that if all films were made of this
caliber, every movie would be a blockbuster.<br /><br />23 years later and this is till my favorite movie. It withstood the
test of time, it never seems outdated...it is so cleverly structured
and developed that if anything else ever comes this close to it, there
might be some slim chance in hell that movies will be somewhat
entertaining.<br /><br />Whenever the theme music comes on the speakers, I crank it up.<br /><br />Wow...what can I say that is negative about it? Only that I was not
part of it...and yet, maybe that&#39;s a good thing.<br /><br />VERY IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!
