1999_September 26 

A true blockbuster in every sense of the word that blows anything today
away. It is a breathtakingly witty and fast paced fantasy with superb
special effects, music and performances that are incredibly engaging. It is
star Fox who truly holds it together with his acutely observed mixture of
confusion and angst as he finds himself in a time where his style and
tastes, particularly in music, are misplaced. Then as his young mother-to-be
falls for him, we are treated to a hilarious group of scenes in which he
tried to shift her attentions to his future dad.
All in all the film works as a perfect example of clever plotting mixed with
a breakneck pace and pure wonder. An all-time favourite.
