Okay, let&#x27;s look at this objectively. The filming is the only thing
that doesn&#x27;t stand out. It does it&#x27;s job to convey a point, and that&#x27;s
it. No eye boggling cinematography here.<br /><br />The music is memorable and enhances the scenes immensely. Great catchy,
well varied songs that make you feel what the characters are: Earth
Angel and Johnny B. Goode come to mind. 9/10 <br /><br />It&#x27;s rare to have memorable characters in film since little details get
washed over, but BTTF&#x27;s plot is highly character based, which works in
being entertaining as well as informative. You&#x27;ll remember all the
names of these characters. 9/10 <br /><br />The plot itself is quite simple, but well executed. It&#x27;s fun with all
the different genres. 7/10 <br /><br />The acting is excellent. Chris Lloyd&#x27;s performance is very over the top
and eccentric, but memorable all the same. Crispin Glover and Lea
Thompson&#x27;s performances are very honest and moving. 9/10<br /><br />In terms of entertainment I find all the foreshadowing (1985) a little
dull, but it&#x27;s impossible to delete it since it introduces all the
characters. The script is very tight and well written, the tension
builds as the film goes along.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve watched this a few times so I&#x27;d say the re-watch value is very
good.
