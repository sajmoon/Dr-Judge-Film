This movie may have came out when I was only 3, but it is my all-time
favorite because it combines suspense, comedy, and mystique all
together in the same film. The casting was intense with the hilarious
Christoper Lloyd playing the eccentric Dr. Brown, and Michael J. Fox as
the typical 80's teenager Marty McFly. I won't give the movie away, but
Marty must get back from 1955 to his era of 1985 AND make sure that his
parents fall in love. Otherwise, he and his siblings will never be
born! The next 2 movies may have been less than amazing, but this movie
starts it all. If you like action-packed, comic, and otherwise amazing
movies you will simply fall in love with this movie. i guarantee it
