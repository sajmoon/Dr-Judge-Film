This is probably the most underrated trilogy of the 20th century, and
in my personal opinion it's almost up there with Indiana Jones and Star
Wars in terms of adventure and fun. <br /><br />It's perhaps the best science-fiction film, in terms of having
widespread appeal while still being also appealing to those intrigued
by the Time Travel angle. I do maintain, however, that this is at
heart, a sci-fi film, maybe not in par with TV shows like Babylon 5 or
Star Trek: The Next Generation in its complexity, but Doc and his time
traveling contraption are really the movie's main draw, and
furthermore, I think that the movie has enough scientific exploration
within it, that it appeals to those scientifically-minded thinkers
within ourselves.<br /><br />At the same time, it mixes the science up with comedy, action, and
romance, and practically everything else, and that's why I think this
practically everyone who's seen this has liked it.<br /><br />The ensemble gets a lot of mileage, just out of playing with type.
Michael J Fox plays the epitome of the rebellious teenager of the 80s,
Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist doc, who initiates the whole
adventure, comes straight out of a comic-book, and just the same, it's
probably the best performance of his career. Also, the protagonist's
dad, George, and his nemesis Biff, are found in the standard nerd and
bully roles. <br /><br />Adding to a great ensemble, this is just an all-around solid film, the
special effects are great, the soundtrack (Alan Silvestri) is one of my
favorites, and it's just, overall, a lot of fun.
