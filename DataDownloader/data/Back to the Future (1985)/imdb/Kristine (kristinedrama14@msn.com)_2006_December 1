I just asked my friend that I&#39;m speaking with through instant messenger
if he had ever seen &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and he said &quot;Yeah, who
hasn&#39;t?&quot;, sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called
me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I&#39;ve seen the movies now!
Ha ha! I&#39;m back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for
the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this
was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250,
but I can&#39;t give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an
excellent film that was ground breaking for it&#39;s time and still today.<br /><br />Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty
isn&#39;t really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his
parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him
his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine.
When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he
jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents
met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he
ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not
even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time
so he can get back without altering the future.<br /><br />Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I
notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J.
Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back
to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor
was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie
that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be
considered cool.<br /><br />10/10
