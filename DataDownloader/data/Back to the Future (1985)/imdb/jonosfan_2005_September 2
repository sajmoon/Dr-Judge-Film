At this address: http://imdb.com/title/tt0429631/ There's a BTTF Game
made in 2004 listed here. At this point I'm assuming it's some error on
the IMDBs part, because a search of the internet reveals nothing about
this game, as does a search of Gamefaqs.<br /><br />Anyone able to shed some light on this? It's possible that it's just a
webgame, but usually they don't list those on this site from what I can
see. It would certainly be great if this game were substantial and
good, but then, if it were I think more people would know about it, or
at least some people would anyway. But really, is there a way to make a
good Back to the Future game that remains true to the story and
characters without being boring? Only time will tell...<br /><br />-Jon
