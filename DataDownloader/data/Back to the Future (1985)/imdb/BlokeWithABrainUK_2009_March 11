I&#39;m a tough guy to please, but this timeless (pun intended) film is
simply a total joy from start to finish and on every level you can
imagine.<br /><br />A perfect script, wonderful performances from every single cast member,
immaculate inspired direction and absolutely perfect pacing make this
one of the few films that you will never ever tire of.<br /><br />Once in a decade or so, someone has an idea for a story that is simply
genius. This is one of those stories. It is astonishing that what is
actually quite a complex tale of time paradoxes becomes so accessible
and easy to follow. You will be swept along on a wave of pleasure.<br /><br />Every time I see it I marvel at the imagination, the humour, the sheer
joie de vie of a film for which no audience member could fail to be
moved and thrilled.<br /><br />Truly a cinematic masterpiece and a treasure for all ages.<br /><br />(And the sequels are great too!)
