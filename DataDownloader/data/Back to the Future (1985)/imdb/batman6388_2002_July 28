Robert Zemeckis is a film genius in every aspect of this film.  If you don't
like this film you are probally a very stupid person that has no taste in
good filmaking.  This time traveling epic stars Michael J. Fox and the
master of comedic acting, Christopher Lloyd.  The plot is brilliant.  It's
1985 and Marty McFly's(Fox) life is boring and strict.  He's a troublemaker
in school, has strict and boring parents and one of his friends is a mad
scientist(Lloyd);the only good part in Marty's life is his girlfriend in
which he is supposed to take her to the mountains for the weekend but his
parents won't let him.  So in the middle of the night, Doc(Lloyd) calls
Marty and tells him to bring a video camera to tape his new time machine. 
When he gets their, Marty finds out that Doc stole plutoneum from
terrorists, Marty is forced to go back in time to 1957 because terrorists
are attacking Doc and Marty.  So he goes back in time and ends up getting
hit by a car in which the driver is his grandfather and ends up waking up in
his house with his mother, as a teenager, falls in love with him and ends up
turning everything thats in the future into dust because she is supposed to
fall in love George McFly, Marty's dad.  It's a very interesting movie and
and it's a real film classic.  I love Michael J. Fox's performance.  I give
this movie a 9 out of 10.
