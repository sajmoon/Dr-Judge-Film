The BTTF-films may very well be the best movie trilogy ever, they sure are
a
lot more entertaining then the Godfather-films<br /><br />First of all, the trilogy is a unique storytelling experiment, the 3 films
make one big story, one can't be seen without the other
ones.
Everything about these films is great. The score by Alan Silvestri can
compete with the best work of John Williams.  The special effects are
(though a little bit dated) efficient and functional.  Lloyd and Fox are
playing the parts of their lives, and they're doing a hell of a
job!
Robert Zemeckis, one of the most underrated directors of our time, keeps
the
pacing tight and the storyline even tighter.  Who cares if there are some
plotholes, this is a sci-fi comedy people!<br /><br />This really is a lot more then just another story for boys, everything fits
together so perfectly.  I must have seen the films a dozen of times and I
still discover new things!
If you haven't seen them yet, leave whatever you're doing and buy/rent them
(make sure you watch then in the right order, I saw part II before I saw
part I: it didn't made much sense)<br /><br />Just wish I could go to the future and buy those DVD's (how much longer
Universal???)<br /><br />
