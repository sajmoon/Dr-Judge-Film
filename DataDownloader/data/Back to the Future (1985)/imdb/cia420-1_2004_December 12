Excellent &#150; the exact word that should be used to describe this movie.<br /><br />The story and screenplay are great and it doesn't sag even for a
moment. The acting though not of Academy standards, is good, especially
Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Lea
Thompson (she's got a great flair for comedy) as Lorraine McFly.<br /><br />Its not surprising that this movie has been given 8/10 by IMDb because
its great in all aspects.<br /><br />This is the best among the trilogy followed by the 3rd and then the
2nd. Back to the Future trilogy is as same as Indian Jones ones, put
reverse. The 1st and 3rd ones being good and the 2nd one not as good.<br /><br />Its sad Hollywood isn't attempting to produce movies like this. It
would be good if they make NOT SO serious, good humored movies like
they did in the 80's like this and Indiana Jones.
