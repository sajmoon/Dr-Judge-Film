Ah Back to the Future without a doubt my favourite film from childhood and
sure it seems dated now but that just adds to its charm.  Michael J Fox has
never been better than in the BTF Trilogy and everyone else in the cast
plays there parts to perfection especially town bully Biff Tannen.  Its a
classic feel good movie that delivers on all levels and even now 16 years
after its release it still has the power to leave a smile on your
face
