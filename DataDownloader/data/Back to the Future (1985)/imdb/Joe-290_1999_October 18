Back to Future, is not a great movie to be honest. It has very good 1955
look-a-like settings but it just a movie for 10 year olds just like Star
Wars or Jurassic Park. It has bad acting from Christopher Lloyd like usual
and bad scting from Michael J fox like usual too. It is interesting in a
way. HAVING A TIME MACHINE, although sounding so stupid is very original for
the time it was made but its copy, Bill + Ted bogus and excellent journeys
and adventures would be a lot better time travelling movies.
