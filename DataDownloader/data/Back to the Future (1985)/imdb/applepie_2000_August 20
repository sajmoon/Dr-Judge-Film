What really amazed (and still amazes) me about this film is its incredible
balance. It's like cooking a good meal: The mixture is as important as the
ingredients. And in this case, long before &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; made it to the big
screen, Robert Zemeckis had already proven to be an excellent chef. Take
superb acting by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, mix it with a
well-written script, add some nice little special effects, stir it real nice
while seasoning it with some fine music, et voil&agrave;: You'll end up with a
wonderful time-travel science fiction comedy that is still far more
enjoyable than almost everything else Hollywood came up with in the last 15
years. <br /><br />It's tough to summarize the plot in just one sentence, but I guess it would
sound something this:
High-School guy Marty (Fox) accidently jumps 30 years back in time and tries
to figure out how to get back to the future without changing it, except for
one thing, which is the death of his buddy and time-travel inventor Doc
Emmit Brown (Lloyd).<br /><br />This is another one of my all time favorites. It's a great family picture
and a must see for all movie buffs anyway. Watch for details...it's worth
it! I lost count, but I think I've seen more than 25 times. But just talking
about this movie makes me feel like...where was that tape
again....???<br /><br />
