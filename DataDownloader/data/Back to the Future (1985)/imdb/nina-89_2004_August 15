Back to the Future provides a lot of good laughs every time I see it.
The science fiction storyline is so hilariously captivating that you
easily find yourself caught up in cheering for the good guys and hating
the bad boy, Biff. Back to the Future is certainly engaging, too, as
many of us have wished at some point in our lives for a chance to alter
our future. The characters are likable, memorable and admirable. My
favorite is definitely Christopher Lloyd who is thoroughly entertaining
and adorable as Doc Brown. He and Michael J. Fox make a hilarious pair
of as they struggle to correct the sequence of life changing events
that they have unexpectedly put into play. Everything about this movie
is fun, playful, and enjoyable.
