HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough
role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an
alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy
scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time
machine (don&#39;t ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also
accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling
for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won&#39;t exist. And
how is he going to get back to 1985?<br /><br />Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good
and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd&#39;s reaction to
Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s
outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far
at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that&#39;s a
small complaint. END SPOILER!!! <br /><br />The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each
other very well--some of Fox&#39;s dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings
are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent
playing Fox&#39;s mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a
teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox&#39;s father--TOO over
the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson&#39;s
mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many
great 1980s film (like &quot;Footloose&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and into
the 90s with &quot;Scream&quot;). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as
a bully--but has no dialogue.<br /><br />Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with &quot;to
be continued...&quot;) and the constant product placement--I know a lot of
movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling
attention to itself that&#39;s a problem.<br /><br />Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the
opening song &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. And don&#39;t miss Lewis&#39; cute cameo as a
teacher at the beginning. I give this a solid 9.
