What teenage boy didn&#x27;t want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in
the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him
back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played
guitar in a band, a carefree spirit &#x96; using vehicles to accelerate his
skateboarding, including a cop&#x27;s and to be able to time-travel &#x96;
catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on &#x27;Back to the Future&#x27;;
I must&#x27;ve watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for
granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely
unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now,
having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I
appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect
lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special
effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be
made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from
the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to
scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back
to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc
Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he&#x27;s really back in time,
he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, &#x22;back to the future.&#x22; At the
same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost
erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively
didn&#x27;t look like a teenager in the sequels &#x96;he barely pulls it off here
and of course there&#x27;s the typical 80s numerous product placements, down
to the DeLorean itself &#x96; ironically, not enough to save the doomed car.
Still, an absolute must-see.
