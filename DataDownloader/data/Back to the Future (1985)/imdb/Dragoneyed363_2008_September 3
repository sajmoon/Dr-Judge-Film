I really loved back To The Future.I was actually kind of dreading
watching this movie, because it looked and sounded pretty terrible.Itw
as in the Top 250, and my friend liked it, so I decided to give it a
try.It turned out that this was just so much fun, and all around a
pretty enjoyable little movie.I did find it a bit boring, and just
uninteresting at times, but it mainly kept my attention.The ending was
really the only big problem I had with this movie, but I&#39;m not going to
reminisce much on that, and also the main character was pretty stupid
and annoying around some parts, but hey, I still loved this movie.It
was pretty great, and you should give it a try and watch it if you
haven&#39;t.
