My brother owns the trilogy so when I visited him I sat down and
watched the whole thing. Honestly, an excellent use of my time.<br /><br />I loved the story. It had a very interesting plot fueled by original
and entertaining characters. To sum it up, a kid gets sent to the past
on an unplanned trip via a time machine constructed by his eccentric
inventor friend. I don&#x27;t want to give away any more than that. This is
truly one of the best films to come from the &#x27;80s. It&#x27;s colorful,
exciting, funny, and filled with a gold mine of amazing &#x27;80s lines. The
music went with the film perfectly, of course, just fun music when it
was a good time, and music to work up the audience when stress was
needed. Director Zemeckis did a great job. I could watch this movie
again and again. It had no low points, no slowing down. It was
genuinely interesting the entire way through.<br /><br />My only problem is one prevalent in many films: overactive coincidence.
Sometimes the conflicts were resolved way too easily, and I felt really
unsatisfied. Maybe I was taking it too seriously, maybe I was expecting
too much, I don&#x27;t know, but a few moments of the film I was
disappointed. No worries though, because the greatness of the film made
me forget the hiccups. I still thing it&#x27;s a super fun ride.<br /><br />This is a perfect movie for family movie night, or hanging out with
friends, anything. I can&#x27;t think of a scenario where viewers wouldn&#x27;t
have a good time watching this movie, except for stuffy, boring people
who have no imagination who perhaps just came from a funeral, or
something like that&#x85;but you probably shouldn&#x27;t be watching any movies
with people just coming from such a sad event, and you probably
shouldn&#x27;t be hanging out with boring people anyway&#x85;so yeah, I stand by
what I said. No scenario exists where you will not like this movie. I
plan on buying it sometime when I get the cash.
