Back to the Future is a very good movie, better than I thought it would
be. Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came
out in the mid-80&#39;s. The story is about a guy named Marty and his
professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and
Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in
1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this
problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film
is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena.
The music makes the movie sound like a true 80&#39;s movie. &quot;Power of Love&quot;
by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for
the ages. I rate this film a 10/10.
