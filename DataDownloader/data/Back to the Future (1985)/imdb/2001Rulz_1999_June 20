1999_June 20 

WOW!!!!! This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen in my
life. It's better than Star Wars, better than Titanic, better than Jurassic
Park, better than Saturday Night Fever, and better than any crap Hollywood
producers pull off these days. I have to admit that 2001: A Space Odyssey
is
my favorite movie of all time, but this movie is my favorite in the
&quot;Adventure/Comedy&quot; category. If you don't like this movie, I seriously
recommend professional help for you. This movie has it all: adventure,
comedy, romance, sci-fi, and suspense. Plus, the sequels to it are actually
very good, unlike some sequels that have been made to movies. You will love
this movie, so, if you can, PLEASE see it!! Christopher Lloyd is awesome,
Michael J. Fox is even better. Great actors, great plot, great music, great
jokes, just plain great MOVIE.<br /><br />
