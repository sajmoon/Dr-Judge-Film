That&#x27;s exactly what I said after viewing this movie for the first time
years ago. Back to the Future is one of the most successful films of
the 80&#x27;s, and today no film has done better at keeping you on the edge
of your seat, and laughing the entire time. Michael J. Fox stars as
Marty McFly, an average high school kid of the 1980&#x27;s who ends up
accidentally getting sent back in time to the year 1955 after his
friend, Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine
out of a DeLorean. Now, trapped in time, Marty has to find a way to get
back into his own time. There&#x27;s more elements to the plot, but I don&#x27;t
want to spoil the entire movie for you. Most people have probably seen
this movie at some point in their life, but if you haven&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a must
see. It has everything you could want from a movie: comedy, action,
suspense, and great special effects for it&#x27;s time. I love Back to the
Future. It&#x27;s one of my favorite movies, and it definitely deserves
recognition as one of the best movies of all time.
