I love this film!  Michael J Fox plays Marty McFly/Calvin Klein, an 80's
teenager who is going nowhere.  His only friend it seems is Doc Brown, an
eccentric inventor, played by Christopher Lloyd, who invents a time machine
out of a De Lorean.  I loved the scene where the De Lorean backs out of the
lorry in the JC Penney parking lot from the Dry Ice.  The soundtrack is
excellent and really fits in with the action. The skateboarding is well done
too as Marty tries to escape from Biff and the gang in the 1955.  Rent this
out now, you will really enjoy it.  If you enjoy this go and rent the
sequel.  It's more of the same fun.  I've given BTTF a 9 out of 10.
