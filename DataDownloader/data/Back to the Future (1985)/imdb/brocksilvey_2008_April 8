The kind of comedy/adventure/sci-fi hybrid that the 1980s did very
well, and which you just don&#39;t see anymore.<br /><br />&quot;Back to the Future&quot; solidified Michael J. Fox as a bona fide movie
star, and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a
scientist who invents a time travel machine. Robert Zemeckis keeps
things light and playful -- he&#39;s one of many directors (like Ron
Howard, Steven Spielberg, etc.) who started out making enjoyable romps
until he felt the need to become &quot;serious&quot; and started making movie
crap like &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; <br /><br />I didn&#39;t fall in love with the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series, but I see
its appeal.<br /><br />Grade: B+
