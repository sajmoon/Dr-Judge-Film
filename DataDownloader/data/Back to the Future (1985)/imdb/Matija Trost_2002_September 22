 Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Alan Silvestri (music). Can just
anything go wrong here?<br /><br /> Hardly. This trio combined a great story in a timeless classic, full of
humor, great charismatic acting from Michael J. Fox (undoubtfully his best
performance. Ever.), not forgetting others, especially good-looking Lea
Thompson aka young Marty's mother. <br /><br /> Back to the future is one of the best movies made in 80's and certainly,
the best movie dealing with time traveling. What just reminds me of a poor
production that Hollywood offers us these days (Time machine, 2 out of 10).
Plus, it's one of the movies, you never get bored watching it again and
again. That's why a strong<br /><br />9 out of 10.<br /><br />
