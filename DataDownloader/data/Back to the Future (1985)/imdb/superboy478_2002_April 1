From Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future is one movie
that is for sure a classic masterpiece.<br /><br />Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is your typical hip 1985 teenager. He plays in
a band, he has a girlfriend, and he has a ton of friends and he lives in
Hill Valley. But, his main friend is a scientist named Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd). When Doc tells Marty about a new invention, it
interests Marty immediatley. But what marty doesn't know is that the
invention is a time machine made out of a hip Delorian
car.<br /><br />When Marty uses the time machine, he accidently goes back in time to 1955!
He sees his parents again which leads to him changing events that makes his
mother Lorainne (Lea Thompson) love him instead of his father George
(Crispin Glover). Another problem is that the time machine is broken. And
Marty and the yound Doc think of a plan to use lightning as their tool to
getting Marty back to the future!<br /><br />Micheal J. Fox (Spin City, Life With Mikey), Christopher Lloyd (Wit, Camp
