This is one of those rare films that simply entertains. It doesn't cause
the
audience to furrow their brows in concentration, but doesn't leave them
watching a load of rubbish with no plot. This is quite the opposite. It
has
a great script, interesting story line, and the cast are great. Micheal J
Fox is brilliant as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is hilarious. All
age
groups would love this film, and I recommend buying the Back To The Future
Trilogy.<br /><br />8/10
