Back to the Future revolves around Marty McFly's adventures in time with
his
Mad-Scientist friend called &quot;Doc&quot;. After years of research Doc finally
invents a time machine. Marty is accidently sent back to time in the year
1955, Where he bumps into his parents and threatens his very own
exsistence
in the future. Then starts a series of adventures to get Marty back in
time
and let his parents fall in love. I've watched this movie so much over and
over again and every time there was some feel of uniqueness in it and I
discovered something new which I have'nt before. The script is strong and
supported by stunning performances of Michael J Fox and Christopher Llyod.
Last but not the least, The soundtrack and musical score by Alan
Silvestri/Outatime Orchestra is amazing and my favourite which includes
performances by Huey Lewis and the News, Chuck Berry and Eric Clapton.
Truly
a masterpiece forever.
