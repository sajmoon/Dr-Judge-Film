2010_June 8 
I watched this film many times when I was a kid, so now, in 2010, I
decided to give it another viewing, if only for the memories of the
&#x27;80s and the &#x27;flux capacitor&#x27; science. What a delight! Sure, there are
plot holes, but the sheer awesomeness of almost every scene, the &#x22;well,
the flux capacitor is fluxing&#x22; attitude, the not taking itself too
seriously make this movie great. The facial expressions and emotions of
the actors are wonderful in every scene and the dialogue is amusing.
The science of the movie is completely bogus but is not very relevant
to the plot and is very believable. I am a big fan of &#x22;Contact&#x22;, also
by Zemeckis, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is also
one of his films, and you can tell by the wonderful soundtrack.<br /><br />Well done!
