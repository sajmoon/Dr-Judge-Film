In my opinion this film is the best ever. Why you may ponder as you
search aimlessly through the database that is IMDb.com. Why purely for
its comedic value of course. Who can honestly say they didn&#39;t laugh
when Marty McFly landed Biff in a pile of Manure or When he encounters
Doc in 1955. And it is not just comedy alone which makes this film so
enjoyable. It is also the unique insight it offers into a situation
which we could never hope to experience, that of seeing our parents as
teenagers. And so If your wondering why this film has achieved cult
status, stop, simply pick up a copy and watch Marty and doc rev up the
delorean to 88mph and see for yourself. You wont regret the experience.
27 years later no one has.
