Marty McFly, who I&#39;m sure you know is Michael J. Fox. is a &quot;slacker&quot; in
high school his senior year. He goes to Doc&#39;s house apparently to tune
up his guitar, and he surprisingly gets blown across the room the
volume&#39;s so high. Marty&#39;s teacher, Mr. Strickland, is an unhappy,
ill-empered, old-guy who pushes Marty, and even Biff in the second and
calls him a slacker. Marty dreams of taking his girlfriend Jennifer to
the lake during the weekend (It&#39;s just a day or so before he&#39;s 18), and
getting a 4 by four, that to me is so ugly and high off the ground that
I, in no shape or form would dream of owning. George McFly, Marty&#39;s dad
is a timid nerd, who&#39;s well known quote is, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I could
take that kind of rejection.&quot; The 80&#39;s setting and release is already
outdated and old school, even though it seems like it&#39;s so advanced,
and they had everything, and the 50&#39;s had nothing. That was a year
before I was born. Biff is the stupidest, funniest person I see.<br /><br />He&#39;s a little wacked in the head. He tells people to, &quot;Make like a tree
and Get outta here&quot;. Marty saves George&#39;s life in the cafe once, and
comes to live with George&#39;s future wife&#39;s house. HE (Marty) instead of
George get&#39;s hit by the car, which is in total danger of altering the
present 1985. Instead of George, Lorraine has the hots for his son ,and
it cracked me up when I was old enough to understand the movie, how she
is so unaware with how inappropriate it sounds to sleep in the same
room as the opposite sex. Things go a little far, and it seems hopeless
for Marty and Doc to get back to 1985, until they hear about the
thunder storm on November 12. Later in the Cafe Marty saves Lorraine,
and does heinous skateboard moves which causes $300 damage to his car,
and cow crap to bury him and his pals. Biff just becomes more creepy,
and violent, but still stupid. It&#39;s fake but awesome how puny Fox finds
such ways to cream Biff, a buff, meat hooked monster, about 210 pounds.
Biff is molesting Lorraine in the car, where the Meek George McFly
saves the day, just seconds before his arm get&#39;s broken, by nailing
Biff, and knocking him out.<br /><br />&quot;Johnny be good&quot; became a favorite of mine from watching the
performance by Marty at the dance, and was my favorite oldie as little
kid.
