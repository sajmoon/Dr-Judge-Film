Back to the Future is the perfect movie. After countless (upwards of
two dozen) viewings, I am convinced that it is flawless and in my
opinion, the most enjoyable movie ever made. The movie&#39;s premise is
teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time and screws up
his parents&#39; first meeting. What separates this from any other sci-fi
movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that
everyone so clearly had in making it. The actors are all great and
perfectly cast, and the movie is never boring; literally every moment
is enjoyable. And it seems to get better with every viewing. From the
opening song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; to the fantastic climactic
&quot;Enchantment Under the Sea&quot; Dance, Back to the Future will captivate
you. My favorite movie of all time is a timeless classic that will
never get old and gets better every time I watch it. A perfect 10/10!
