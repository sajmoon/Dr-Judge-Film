Sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to
be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films.
Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of
inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a
really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making
of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy
watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film.
The film could have been released five years before or five years after
1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same
effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid
romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and
therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone
providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens
it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.
