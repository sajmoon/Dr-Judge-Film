1999_December 10 

This is truly one of, if not the best 80s movie.  And it's impossible to
buy
it until next year when they re-release it.  Michael J. Fox is to die for
and the special effects are crude yet when you look at how far we've come
in
such a short time, they aren't that bad.  The story is great and you'll
never forget the &quot;space time continuum&quot;  or
the &quot;flux capaciter.&quot;  I have the whole thing memorized, music and all.
It's
my favorite movie, and will be your's.
