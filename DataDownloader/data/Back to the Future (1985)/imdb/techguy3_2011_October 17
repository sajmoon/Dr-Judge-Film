This time travel turkey has all the adventure of a snail with motor
neurons disease. I can&#x27;t believe people would find this entertaining.
And what&#x27;s with that car? how can a Delorean be a time machine given
its spacial design? And if you can stomach th performance by George
Dichcenzo who play Marty&#x27;s grandfather, then your up for some kind of
endurance trophy. Marty should have been sent back to biblical times so
that he can be lynched and put to death on the cross. It is an utter
waste of talent that director Robert zemeckis should have involved
himself with this crud not once but three times. Thank god he redeemed
himself later with &#x27;death becomes her&#x27;.
