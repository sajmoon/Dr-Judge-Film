1999_November 15 

I don't care as much about who is directing a movie as some people do, as my
top 20 movie list has 20 different directors, but Robert Zemeckis is
probably one of my top 5 favorites of all time. <br /><br />Even though I liked Back to the Future more when I was a kid, I think it is
an enjoyable flick for both adults and children. Certainly there were things
that strained credibility; like the 30-something Lloyd looking 60 something,
the people in the picture fading out of existence, and the lightning coming
on the exact second of the minute change. But, this is a comedy, as well as
a movie trying to deal with time travel, and I am able to put those petty
complaints aside enough to realize how entertaining this film is.<br /><br />I thought that Zemeckis and the actors did a very good job of blending
comedy and action together in a smooth fashion. Fox's physical work was
impressive to say the least, and I must have laughed at his athletic comedy
3 or 4 times. <br /><br />In short, this is an exciting, funny and memorable film for all ages. I
can't say that about very many movies. <br /><br />Jeremy Barger
