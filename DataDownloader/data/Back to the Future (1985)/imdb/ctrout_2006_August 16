Back to the Future is probably the best and quintessential time
traveling movie ever made. You can&#39;t go far without someone spouting
out its memorable dialogue and imitating its wonderful characters. Now
that it&#39;s over twenty years old, Back to the Future is entertaining a
whole new generation.<br /><br />It has a simple enough story that involves a teenager who longs for a
better life and the crazy scientist friend who builds a time machine.
When the scientist&#39;s unveiling of a time machine made out of a DeLorean
goes awry, the teenager ends up accidentally going back in time thirty
years. While he&#39;s there he sees all of the people he knows from 1985,
except they&#39;re now thirty years younger.<br /><br />A genius story like that creates an excellent movie and a star making
performance by Michael J. Fox as the teenager. The highlight of this
movie comes from the scientist played by Christopher Lloyd. His whacky
antics were perfect for the role and made the character of Doc Brown
immediately come to life.<br /><br />Some viewers today may think that an &#39;80s movie that ends up becoming a
&#39;50s movie won&#39;t be for them. Those people are sorely mistaken, because
if you&#39;re looking for a wild ride that will keep you entertained and in
stitches, look no further. Back to the Future has everything you crave.
