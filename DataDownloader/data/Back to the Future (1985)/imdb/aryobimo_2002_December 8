This movie is one of the best adventure movie of alltime. Even better, it
comes in trilogy. I have watch this movie hundreds of time, since I own
the
laser disc (remember them?) for Back to the future 1 and 2. When the DVD
comes out, I would still buy them since it is much more convenient (no
need
to change sides!) and what i hope for is better technology that DVD could
offer. My favorite part (and i'm sure also everyone else's) is when Marty
played johny b good (a real classic scene! Can't get that anywhere else!),
and I love how the events changed by Marty brought good change to his
family
in the future. If you never watch any of the trilogy, make sure to pick up
all three. Those who has, i suggest that you also bought all three since
this is one adventure you will never be bored off, over and over
again.
