2000_July 2 

This movie is a classic. One of my top ten movies of all time. The whole
trilogy is great. I could never figure out why they never made a trilogy
box
for this series. This is definetly one of the greatest movies of all time
in
my opinion and in other opinions. Who wouldve thought a Deolorian could
take
you so far. The whole trilogy is well thought out and the effects are
excellent even for today. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of
the best.
