Michael J. Fox is perfect as Marty. Christopher Lloyd is perfect as Doc
Brown. Crispin Glover is perfect as George. Lea Thompson is perfect as
Lorraine. Good cast, outstanding movie, outstanding music, excellent
special
FX, this movie is the best. The only character I hate is Biff.<br /><br />Wow! I was very impressed by this movie and you should be too. &quot;Great
Scott!&quot; Outstanding! Should you see this movie? Yes.
