Everyone likes this movie, but most people think of it merely as a fun
80's
flick that you watch on Saturday afternoons on TBS.  But I truly feel that
this is a first-rate movie of Oscar quality.  First of all, the script is
impeccable.  Every little detail seems to fit together perfectly, which is
extremely difficult to do in a time travel movie (just look at some of the
gaping plot holes in parts II and III, which by the way, are also fun
movies).  And the humor is very witty and intelligent.<br /><br />Sure, it's an 80's film, with its fun but cheesy Huey Lewis and the News
soundtrack (I have to mention that Alan Silvestri's theme is one of the
best
movie themes ever written).  But in a decade when very few great movies
were
made, this one stands out as one of the best.  In my opinion, this is one
of
the ten best films made during the entire 1980's.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over and over
again, and never get bored.  But next time you watch it, pay attention how
meticulously it was created, from the direction to the writing to the
action
to the music.  This film is one of a kind.
