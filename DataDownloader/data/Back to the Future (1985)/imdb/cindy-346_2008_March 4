Back To The Future is a great movie that has everything.<br /><br />A terrific story, memorable characters, great acting, dead-on satire,
beautiful FX and great music. Every scene in this movie is a winner.
Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From
start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags
(the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines
(&quot;You can&#39;t have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it.&quot;) and in-jokes
(rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time
travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable
for any science fiction movie. Except this isn&#39;t a sci-fi film. It&#39;s a
comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both
levels.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play
guitar than do anything else. He&#39;s friendly with the town&#39;s
off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time
machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955.
There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and
Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get
married and have him.<br /><br />The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to
play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big
screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty&#39;s father, George McFly. He
has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is
almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the
bully who constantly torments George McFly.<br /><br />Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis&#39;s best movie. Kids and
adults will appreciate it.
