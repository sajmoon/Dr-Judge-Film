This is a great movie, pure and simple. The story is brilliant. Marty
McFly gets into a time machine, made out of a car, and created by a man
named Doc Brown. As soon as he gets into the car Doc. Brown is shot by
people with guns, in a hurry Marty gets into the car and drives away,
but because of the fact that it is A TIME MACHINE! He is sent back to
the 1950&#x27;s. He ends up accidentally stopping his parents from falling
in love, the Doc Brown of the 50&#x27;s tells Marty that he must fix them
up, of he will cease to exist. The lines and characters of Marty, Doc
Brown, and Biff are very likable and-or memorable. Some of the lines
that these 3 characters say are some of the most memorable lines. Since
&#x22;No Luke, I am your father.&#x22; The acting in this motion picture,
although not Oscar worthy, is in fact fact great. Michale J. Fox and
Christopher Loyd give good performances as Marty and Doc Brown. The
best part about this movie are the effects. They are beautiful. Sure
today they are not mind blowing, but still good. Now time to wrap this
up. So in the end this is a very good Sci-Fi flick, and I recommend it
heavily.
