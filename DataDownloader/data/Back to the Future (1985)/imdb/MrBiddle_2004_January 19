This is one of the most of the most perfectly constructed movies ever.
Mostly, I'm speaking of the script. As entertaining as this movie is, you
can't go wrong by studying how the writer PLANTS and how he puts in
PAYOFFS
near the end. many of which can be hilarious. Pay attention to &quot;Pepsi
Free&quot;
or how Lorayne doesn't want her daughter to &quot;chase boys&quot;. Also I love the
skateboarding scene done to &quot;POWER OF LOVE&quot; by Huey Lewis. And watch how
Marty knows how to grip the backs of vehicles and ride with them while his
legs are still on his skateboard. Also very clever and appropriate
foreshadowing. 10 out of 10.
