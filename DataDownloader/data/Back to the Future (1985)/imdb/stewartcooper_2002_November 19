I've never been a big fan of science fiction, yet for one reason or another,
I manage to draw an exception when it comes to the Back to the Future
trilogy. An extremely clever, amusing and well-crafted series, the first
film in particular never fails to bring a smile to my face, no matter how
many times I've seen it. It's a tremendous feel-good movie that's difficult
to criticise. Congratulations, Mr Zemeckis!<br /><br />The concept of time travel has always fascinated mankind.  When put into
practice, albeit within the frameworks of fiction, it forces us to consider
just which periods of time we would visit if we were ever fortunate enough
to stumble upon a time machine. But surely the chances of this ever
happening are as unlikely as being struck by a bolt of lightning. . .or is
it?<br /><br />A well-knitted cast, headed by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, provide
wonderful performances. Many of the cast members appear in all three films,
playing a variety of different roles. Although lacking scientific reality
(though this has to be forgiven in science fiction), there are few flaws
overall. The second helping of the trilogy, to many, proved a little
lacklustre, though by the time of the concluding part, the magic and twist
of the original film was undoubtedly recaptured.<br /><br />Boasting a magnificent soundtrack - from the famous orchestral score and the
passion of Huey Lewis and the News, to Marty's sparkling rendition of
'Johnny Be Good' in the style of Eddie Van Halen - and an effective dose of
special effects, Back to the Future has infectious charm. Highly recommended
for all, regardless of their approach to film.<br /><br />
