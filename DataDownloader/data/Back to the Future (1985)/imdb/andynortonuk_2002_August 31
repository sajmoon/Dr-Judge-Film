Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite science-fiction comdey
movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and
enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th(Yes that's how many times I watched it!)
time of watching and never fails to bring a smile. Humour for all ages and a
kick-ass DeLorean car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those
young at heart?<br /><br />From Marty's &quot;Johnny B Goode&quot; to Doc's classic quote &quot;Run For It Marty!&quot;
You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still
laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the
dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a
nickel &quot;Save The Clock Tower!&quot;<br /><br />It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in
terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my
repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.<br /><br />It gets a solid 10 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson,
the insane but comic Doc, played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd in one of
his best feature film roles, and the typical teenager Marty make this film a
must for all young at heart. And with the director, Robert Zimericks,
directing this masterpiece, you cannot go wrong with a combination  as
this!<br /><br />
