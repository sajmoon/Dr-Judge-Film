Yet another classic 80s movie! It seems most of the good movies were always
made sometime in the 1980s! BTTF is the first movie in the brilliant
original trilogy, and is indubitably the best of the three!<br /><br />Smart writing, excellent performances, memorable soundtrack, terrific
special-effects and just about everything you can ask for in a highly
enjoyable ride that you will remember for a long long time is in this beauty
of a movie! I remember seeing it for the very first time over seven years
ago and I couldn't care less about it, but when I saw it again last month,
I've been watching it regularly around twice a week!!<br /><br />BTTF is a fast-paced laugh-fest, unlike the many comedies out there, and it
is a MUST MUST MUST-SEE! Fox is great and I doubt if the movie would have
been even half as enjoyable if Eric Stoltz (who was replaced by Fox) played
Marty McFly! Lloyd is absolutely amazing as the hyperactive Doc Brown, but
the show stealer is Crispin Glover as the wimp father of Fox's McFly! His
George McFly (from 1955) has just gotta be seen! Biff Tannen is played
PERFECTLY by Thomas F. Wilson, and last but not the least, Marty's mom is
just pure and simple WONDERFUL! Lea Thompson did an excellent job as both
the Lorraines! This is one terrific feel-good movie! Be sure to watch the
whole series!!<br /><br />Oomph!-meter (from 5): *****
