Still an instant classic my books, Back to the Future for me was the
&quot;ultimate&quot; in family entertainment.<br /><br />It's even more of a blessing to learn that the DVD is coming soon, which
should really please &quot;Die-Hard&quot; fans.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox was a real role model to look up to in this film.
Everything
his character was, was something I could relate to in terms of wishing for
a
better life than that of his previous time existence.<br /><br />It's just a &quot;REAL&quot; shame that films like this don't get to be made with
the
same passion and enthusiasm as before. Try to do yourself the favor of
avoiding watching too much commercial crap out there that tries to hard
too
hard to take after films like this and begin re-live classic films that
still know how to please those since childhood.<br /><br />My only dissapoinment about the film was Claudia Welles' character of
Jennifer Parker, considering that she didn't bother reprising her role in
the next two installments, paving the way for a rather wooden Elisabeth
Shue
to take over the role.<br /><br />Since the Star Wars trilogy and E.T. can enjoy 20th anniversary
re-releases,
why not trying to add Back to the Future to the equation. It wouldn't be a
bad idea at all the newer generation to really appreciate genuine
Speilberg/Zemekis films of past and present.<br /><br />Let the good times roll.
10/10
