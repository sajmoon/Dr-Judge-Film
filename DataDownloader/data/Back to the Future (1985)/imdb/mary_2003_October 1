Back to the Future 1, 2 &amp; 3 are definitely my favorite movies ever. In fact
I have seen them so many times in my life from when I was a little kid until
now, I'm 18 years old, I like memorized every word in them. I know that
seems a little sad, but every time I watch these movies they captivate me. I
just love everything about them. The acting, the story, the effects, the
music. I just love it. Marty is the man and Doc is my hero. Great movies!<br /><br />
