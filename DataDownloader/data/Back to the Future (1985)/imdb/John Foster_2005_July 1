Back to the Future is an above average movie, and I especially enjoyed
the first 30 minutes, when my eyes were totally glued to the screen. I
think the movie successfully spans the genres of Sci-fi, Comedy and
Adventure to come up with an original feel that appeals particularly to
teenagers and young adults...<br /><br />After watching Back to the Future Part II for 30 minutes I could
already see that it didn't match its predecessor. Repetition was rife
and one of the characters (Jennifer) was put to sleep early on, which
was surely a sign of a plot lacking direction. Don't think I'll bother
watching Part III...<br /><br />I read a review a while ago suggesting that the Back to the Future
trilogy was better than the Star Wars trilogy. I have to say, on the
basis of what I've seen, I don't agree. Star Wars was an altogether
more mature movie experience about life, the universe, and everything.
Back to the Future is just good fun.
