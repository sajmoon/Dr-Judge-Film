When I was a kid i used to watch Back to the Future about everyday. I really
enjoyed all these movies. The first one was good because it showed the
setting in a time not too far away (1955)which i think helped viewers focus
more on how time travel worked then getting fixed on settings in the past or
future. A really good movie. A movie that can live up to rivals in a time
decades ahead of itself truly shows that it is a winner.
