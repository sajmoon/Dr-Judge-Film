I totally love everything about this movie. Every time I watch it it gets
better. From start to finish the story build to a climax with the clock
tower scene. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I know almost every
line
of this movie. If anyone loves this movie as much as me, please feel free
to
e-mail me. Because this film is so underrated. I think it gives a new
meaning to Generation gap. Anyway story goes like this, You've got your
typical 80's teenager(Marty) and typical semi-mad scientist(The Doc), who
just happen to be friends. and the Doc invites Marty to help with one of
his
experiments, and it &quot;all goes horribly wrong&quot; and Marty ends up being send
back in time 30 years and as he approaches the town he's lived in all his
life(presumably), he just happens to run into his parents and prevents them
from meeting, then he finds the Doc, who at first doesn't believe him but
after some convincing, helps him to get his parents together and send him
&quot;Back To The Future&quot; hence the title. You have to see this movie because
it's so great.
