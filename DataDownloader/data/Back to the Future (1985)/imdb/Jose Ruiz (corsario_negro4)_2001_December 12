The movie begin with fantastic frames showing clocks and automatic
machines... Since 1985 have passed many years, but I still stay waiting
some
of that wonderful home where Doc lives. Back to the Future is a movie full
of details, full of comedy, but overall, is a film that explain a theory
about time travel in a serious and possible way.
If you love the time travel, please, don't let escape this master
piece.
