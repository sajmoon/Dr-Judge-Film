This is truly a classic, back when special effects looked realistic
rather than impressive. I have always been fascinated by time travel
and this movie demonstrates it to the full. If you&#39;re interested in
time travel you will not get bored of this film! Oh and it&#39;s sequels
are also excellent (although I like to think of it as one huge movie).
Best trilogy ever in my opinion.<br /><br />Not only is this a fantasy sci-fi, but also an adventure with comedic
value. Tom Wilson known for his comedic roles (eg. wing commander
series) does an excellent job of portraying Biff. In fact all the
actors do an amazing job especially considering they all play multiple
roles in different time-lines and realities. If you haven&#39;t already
seen it, give it a try. 10/10 from me.
