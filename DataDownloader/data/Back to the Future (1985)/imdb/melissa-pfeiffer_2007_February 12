I have seen this movie since I was an early teenager. This one of those
films that I can watch over and over again. Every time I watch them I
find out something new that I didn&#39;t see before. I even try to find the
mistakes but I never can find them. I think that Michael J. Fox is a
great actor and he did this part very well. He even did the part of his
daughter pretty well(playing a girl). I would recommend this movie to
anyone is see. All the other actors played their parts very well. I
wish they would of continued the story of Marty and Jennifer. We do not
know what happened to them. We just have to guess that they end up
together. If I could meet Michael J. Fox I would ask him if he liked
playing this part.
