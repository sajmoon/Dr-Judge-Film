This movie is a delightful romp that ranks as one of the best recent
fantasy films(along with Ghostbusters and Raiders of the Lost Ark). It
doesn't suffer from an annoying, too-hip teenage protagonist that is
abound
in John Hughes' films and Kevin Williamson's crop. Marty is a likeable kid
who is forced, in a freak accident, to 1955 and has to save his and his
sibling's future from never occurring. Even though he has a time machine
his
main problem is still time. Good thing he has the eccentric Doc' on his
side. The plot has many twists, but is easy too follow. It is
well-directed
and well-writen and is followed with two, satisfying and successful
sequels.
Hop on the Back to the Future bandwagon. Now.
