OK...it looks like I&#39;m the only person in civilization that hates this
movie. I was at a friend&#39;s house, and it was rented for part of the
evening&#39;s entertainment. I saw it way back in 1985 when it came out,
and I did not then have any particularly hostile feelings toward it,
but after seeing it again recently and looking through the comments on
IMDb, I must conclude that it is the most overrated film ever made.<br /><br />A quick browse through the comments yields such superlatives as,
&quot;Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!&quot;, &quot;The perfect movie package&quot;,
&quot;One of the most original idea ever to put on film&quot;(sic), and &quot;One of
the best movies ever made in the history of film making.&quot; Everyone is
entitled to his or her opinion, I guess.<br /><br />Plot-wise, this movie is as sit-com formulaic as they come. I can see
how the pitch went to get this film made. &quot;We&#39;ll make an episode of
Three&#39;s Company meets Happy Days with some time travel in it!&quot; I must
also point out that this film is not science fiction. It is fantasy.<br /><br />Maybe this is my own personal problem, but science fiction should make
some attempt at plausibility. This movie relies on a device called the
&#39;flux capacitor&#39; that requires gigawatt&#39;s of power and a DeLorean
moving at 88 miles an hour to function, although why this is the case
and what the device does is never even vaguely delineated. The film
would have been just as plausible if it involved a wizard that zapped
people back in time with a medieval talisman and an incantation that
required precise rhythm and pronunciation. It might even have been more
plausible that way.<br /><br />I suppose it&#39;s the &#39;science fiction&#39; of it that really honks me off. It
seems that so many people regard this film as good sf, and it is not.
If you want a good example of sf, look at Terry Gilliam&#39;s Brazil. Many
people find that film confusing and impenetrable, but good sf usually
takes some work to appreciate because it deals with concepts that most
people haven&#39;t thought about. This film just takes a formulaic stroll
through a combination of well-worn clich&eacute;s to be found all over
situation comedies and time travel stories. Come to think of it,
Gilliam&#39;s Twelve Monkeys deals with the time travel concept far better
than this film does.<br /><br />OK, this isn&#39;t to say the film has no redeeming qualities. It does have
some amusing moments. As a sit-com, it&#39;s OK. For comedy in science
fiction, though, the Fox network show Futurama is vastly better.
