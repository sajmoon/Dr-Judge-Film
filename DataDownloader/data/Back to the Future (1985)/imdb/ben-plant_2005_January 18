The film is fantastically clever and the plots are very good. Also, the
car looks so damn good with it's bits on, and it definitely sparked my
interest in cars, particularly the rare ones. I don't care how many
people say it's fake and it's poorly rendered and whatever, but i think
it looks amazing and it deserves a heck of a lot of praise! The second
film is not as good as the first, and the third was not as good as
either of the other two. But it is still an amazing piece of film and a
truly incredible plot line and story. The characters are very
believable and this is always good. The actors used just slot right in,
and things are so smooth with the actors that it looks almost as though
it's a documentary.
