SPOI......screw it if you havent seen this movie you are retarted....I love
this movie, it is one of the best I have ever seen. I mean the plot is just
genius and the casting is great Michale J. Fox and Christopher Loyyd are
some of the greatest acters ever. Like I said before a boy travels back in
time meets his parents saves his own future and changes it for the better.
It is just a great movie and i cannot wait for the DVD!!!!!!!!!!! i give
this movie a 9.5/10
