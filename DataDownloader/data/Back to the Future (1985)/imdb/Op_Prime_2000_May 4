Back to the Future is one of the most original and unique movie of the
1980s. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have great chemistry together,
which the film benefits from. Tom Wilson is also great as Biff. Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale came up with a great script. Also great special
effects. Thumbs up.
