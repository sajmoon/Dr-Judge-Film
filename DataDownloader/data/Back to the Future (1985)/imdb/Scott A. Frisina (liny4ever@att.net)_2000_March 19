A childhood fantasy come true-what were my parents *really* like when they
were young?  Thanks to the inadvertent help of Dr.Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; L. Brown
(Christopher Lloyd), Hill Valley's resident eccentric scientist/inventor,
some literary foundation set by Jules Verne, and the psychological theories
of Freud, 17 year old Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is about to reluctantly
find out.<br /><br />Marty's family is somewhat dysfunctional.  Though his father George (Crispin
Glover) is a nice man, too nice as a matter of fact, he is desperatley
afraid of conflict and rejection (a family trait that is starting to spill
over into Marty's personality).  He lacks confidence to even ask a girl out
on a date.  And worst of all, he can't stand up to his overbearing
co-worker, bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), a guy that's been
intimidating poor George since their teenage years in the 1950's.  Marty's
mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), though a loving woman, is now an alcoholic,
trying to wash away the frustration of having fallen in love with a man who
is essentially a loser because she felt pity for him way back in high
school.  Rounding out this less than ideal family situation is older brother
Dave (Marc McClure) who can't do any better for himself than work for
minimum wage at a fast food joint and middle sister Linda (Wendie Jo
Sperber), who seems to just hang around the house, eat, and
complain.<br /><br />Marty is accidentally transported back to Hill Valley, 1955 (I won't divulge
how) where he must, in order to get back to the future, where he belongs,
contact a 30 years younger &quot;Doc&quot; Brown for help.  But before this happens,
Marty inadvertently interferes with a crucial incident in his parents
development which sends his personal time path off course along with the
rest of the family.  Unless this is corrected, Marty and his siblings will
never be born.  And if this is not bad enough, Marty's mother, not knowing
this is her 17 year old son in 30 years, falls in mad love/lust with him.   
           <br /><br />&quot;Back to the Future&quot;, a time travel sci-fi fantasy written by Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale and directed by Zemeckis, is the ultimate time travel
movie.  No detail is left unturned.  For example, when Marty leaves 1985,
the shopping mall where this occurs is called the &quot;Twin Pines Mall&quot;.  In the
last act of the film, as a result of his interfering with the past, we see
the sign has changed to read &quot;Lone Pine Mall&quot;.  The script is brilliant and
the direction is perfect.  The film is suspenseful, funny and exciting.  My
personal favorite shot is of Marty, in the first act, sitting and listening
to the dinner table conversation between his mother and sister, as his
mother describes how she and their father met back in 1955.  Marty doesn't
say a word, but he has a haunted look on his face like he is personally
familiar with these events but can't figure out why.  Excellent
foreshadowing and a hint of the eventual time circle.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  All seem to have fun with this material and give
wonderful performances.  It was an excellent decision by Zemeckis to have
Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson play their roles as both teenagers and
adults instead of having two other actors play either age.  <br /><br />&quot;Back to the Future&quot;, with &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, is the best of the early Amblin
Entertainment films and ranks with the best of sci-fi fantasy.  It is a film
that can spark many hours of time travel discussion and debate.           <br /><br />&quot;To Be
