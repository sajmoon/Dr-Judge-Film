I have no problem giving this movie a 10 out of 10. Exuberant, bursting
with inventiveness, this movie is a joy. Marty MckFly is a great
character, and the whole movie is done so well. Where are these movies
nowadays? This may be my favourite Robert Zemeckis movie. And what a
great career move for Michael J. Fox. He almost didn&#39;t get the gig;
Eric Stoltz was almost cast instead. Flying Delorians and Flux
Capacitors, Lightning Rods and Chuck Barry, an incestuous kiss and a
disorderly scientist, elaborate inventions/models and pretty
girls--1980&#39;s fun, indeed idiosyncratically 80&#39;s while also
transcending cultural specificity...those lacking a sensibility for
material from that decade will still find nothing to complain about in
this happy exuberant adventure story.
