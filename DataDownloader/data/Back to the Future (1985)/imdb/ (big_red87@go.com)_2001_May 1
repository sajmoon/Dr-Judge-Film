Back to the Future is an excellent film.  It combines action, comedy and
drama into a prefect mixture.  Each element is woven intricatly into the
plot.  The switch from a comedic moment to a dramatic moment and back
again
is done so well that it's still beleivable.<br /><br />The final climax of the movie has got to be the best  sequence of events
ever put into a sequence.  One thing after another goes wrong.  Marty must
accellerate to 88 and have the hook on the top of the car meet the wire
over
that street at the precise moment that the lighning strikes the clock
tower.
Al  the doc must reconect the cable that will carry the
electricity to the wire above the street and down through the hook into
the
car's flux capacitor.<br /><br />This movie totally kicks @$$
