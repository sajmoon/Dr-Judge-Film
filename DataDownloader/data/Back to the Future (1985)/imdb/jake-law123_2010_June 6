Anyone who lives on the planet Earth has got to love this film. It&#x27;s
one of the the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Director Robert
Zemeckis, along with producer/director Steven Spielberg, and many other
great movie makers, invent the greatest comedy of all time.<br /><br />However you look at it, whether as an action film, a comedy, a sci-fi,
or whatever, it will look excellent no matter what. The effects and
sound effects are spectacular, but the hook into the film are the
hilarious and lovable characters, the terrific performances, and the
editing job put into the film. The story is one of the greatest
screenplays ever.<br /><br />Marty Mcfly is an average teen in 1985 whose friend, Doc Brown, invents
a time machine out of a Dolorian. Marty accidentally activates it while
running from terrorists, and travels to the year 1955, where he meets
his parents-to-be as teens, screwing up their first meet. On top of
getting them back together, he teams up with the past Doc Brown to fix
the time machine to be able to send him back to his time period. The
conflicts and plot of the story are all spectacular and work
brilliantly to the core.<br /><br />Has tons of laughs along the way. The doc, played by Christopher Lloyd,
is without a doubt the best character. His crazy scientist ways will
have your gut busted with laughter. The clever irony works terrificly
as well, especially with scenes with Martie&#x27;s teen parents. Conflicts
arise, and the film gets more and more entertaining by the minute.
Another great character is Biff, who was an old bully of Martie&#x27;s dad,
who becomes one of the main antagonists in the film, as he plans to
take Martie&#x27;s mom, and dispose of Martie&#x27;s dad. Although he&#x27;s evil, he
still makes you laugh hard.<br /><br />Ends happily, but without spoiling anything, its a simple masterpiece
that must be seen.
