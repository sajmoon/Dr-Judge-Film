What can I say; it&#39;s the usual Spielberg/Zemeckis sensibility; a little
dumbed-down and &quot;B-movie&quot;-ish, while delivering genuine humor and
pathos.<br /><br />They&#39;re movies &quot;for the masses;&quot; the writing, scenario work, pacing,
directing is carefully designed to fill in the blanks for our slower
brethren, but it works on many levels and has something for everyone.<br /><br />After all these years, it&#39;s still a great trilogy.<br /><br />Which reminds me of perhaps the most amazing thing of all. In stark
contradiction to the immutable law of sequels, the trilogy gets better
with each installment; the third is a marvel, feeling like the
storyline has reached maturity. Perhaps, by the time they were shooting
the third, the money folks backed off a tad and let the creative people
breathe: You can feel it. The hyperbolically directed leads are
actually given some slack to ply well-honed stage-style theatrical
skills, and it looks and feels well-rounded and true.<br /><br />Also, the film is simultaneously dated--&#39;80s American youth values,
without serious circumspection--and yet somehow timeless. Perhaps the
feeling is that there *is* a kind of circumspection; that Marty, by
story&#39;s end, has actually grown a little. Always nice to see some of
that leak out of a &quot;pop&quot; movie.
