I don&#39;t usually comment on movies but on this movie I&#39;ll make an
exception. The story starts with teenager Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox),
a dedicated guitar player with a wonderful girlfriend (Claudia Wells).
He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover)
being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and
sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty
has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd)
who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years.
We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film,
however he is referred to as a &#39;real nut case who is very dangerous&#39; by
his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty&#39;s guts. We are soon
shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports
himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both
their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys
the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle
from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they
come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should&#39;ve
mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).<br /><br />This film is a lot of fun having both humour and lots of twists and
turns throughout the entire film. Superb acting by Fox who was actually
22 years old playing a 17 yrs old teenager, however most of us wouldn&#39;t
notice. Terrific acting by Lloyd, Glover and Thompson who had very
unusual roles. Zemeckis&#39;s directing is top quality, especially the
beginning with the many clocks which *hints* this is a movie on time
travel. A very family movie for people of all tastes that will always
be a classic in my books. <br /><br />4.5/5
