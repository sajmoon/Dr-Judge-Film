Nearly everybody has seen this at some point - it is one of those films
that I never tire of watching - yes it may be nearly 20 years old but
it holds up to many modern films in a way that few its age can.<br /><br />This is one the best films that Zemeckis has ever made and helped to
establish him as a director.<br /><br />I can not believe that so many studios turned this film down as it now
seems to be regularly played on the TV.<br /><br />Whilst the film may be corny and sappy - it also entertains and there
are few who don't find it entertaining.<br /><br />10 / 10 - Top-notch family film for all ages
