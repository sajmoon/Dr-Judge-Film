I really don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to not enjoy this movie. It
doesn&#x27;t matter who you ask, I can nearly guarantee everyone has great
memories of this film. It&#x27;s a classic; most people would agree. The
story is well-known but for the 1% of you who may not be familiar:
Marty McFly is an average teenager living in 1985 until his friend Doc
Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. When problems arise,
Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 and he realizes that his actions
may have prevented his own existence unless he can correct his
mistakes. By now, everyone knows the deal: the car, the characters, and
the countless memorable moments.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t get enough of that DeLorean. It will forever be my favorite
film car. Despite having been released in 1985, the effects in this
film hold up surprising well. Every time I watch the DeLorean sparking
up as it leaving through time, it&#x27;s like watching it for the very first
time. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are two of the most fun
characters in cinema history in the form of Marty and Doc. They&#x27;re
perfect; I honestly can&#x27;t imagine anyone else having been cast in those
roles. Honestly, that extends to the supporting cast as well...Lea
Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. I&#x27;ll always love Glover&#x27;s
performance as Marty&#x27;s father George and its a shame he didn&#x27;t return
for the sequel.<br /><br />Everyone&#x27;s got a favorite moment from this film, as it&#x27;s loaded with
fantastic scenes. Mine would have to be Marty&#x27;s initial reaction to
finding himself in 1955 and his guitar performance of &#x22;Johnny B. Goode&#x22;
at the dance. Seriously, there isn&#x27;t much a person can say about this
film as just about everyone&#x27;s seen it and knows how fun it is. It was
the start of one of the most entertaining film trilogies and it&#x27;s a
worldwide phenomenon.
