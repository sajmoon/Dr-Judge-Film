  It doesn't surprise me one bit, that this film is on the Top 250 list.
From the moment the clocks tick, to when the DeLorean shoots up into the
sky, I'm trapped inside there. There are plenty of things that I enjoy about
this film...<br /><br />  First of all, I want to mention something that most people take for
granted. The Score. I love the music for this film. It REALLY suits it. Both
with feeling and cinematically. I would really like to take my hat off for
Alan Silvestri.<br /><br />  I also want to mention the camera work on this film. The camera work on
this film is so awesome! In just about every scene I find the camera work is
well done.<br /><br />  Another thing that I really enjoy in this film, is that it is one of the
few movies where the movie is always flowing. No matter what is going on, it
always seems that the film is always flowing well and with a large amount of
interest.
  So I suppose that this flows much into story. At first glance, I don't
quite understand why they chose them, but when the they justify the
decision, it makes the film that much more interesting.<br /><br />  Overall...excellent!
