The first part of one of the best trilogies ever. Pieces of this movie are
constantly drawn up in the latter parts of the trilogy. All three movies are
brilliantly united. One movie effects on another one and they are more like
a one big story.  One of the best movies concerning the possibilities and
difficulties of time travel. If you've only seen this one you should see the
pt.II and III too.<br /><br />And of course, R.Zemeckis is a Master of making great stories
alive!
