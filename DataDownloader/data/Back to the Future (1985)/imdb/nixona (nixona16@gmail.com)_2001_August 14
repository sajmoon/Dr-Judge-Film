This was my favorite movie when I was a kid. And it is still one of my
favorites.
There are numerous reasons for that but the main is that I'm having a
great
fun and great laugh every time I see it.
When I'm talking about this movie I'm thinking of all 3 parts of the
series
'cause they are a whole to me. We really have to give credits Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale for their writings. Everything is related from the
first event in the first movie to the last one in the 3rd part, and there
are some new connections that I detect each time I see the
movie.<br /><br />The credits should also go to Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd for
their
acting. They really made Marty McFly and Doc alive. There's no doubt that
those are the best roles in theirs careers.
The others are good too and all in all we have three great
movies.<br /><br />It would be nice if they would try to extend it to four and let us see
where
are Marty and Doc after 15 years.
Not a bad idea, ha?
