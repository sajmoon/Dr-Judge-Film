One of the most original idea ever to put on film, that is for
sure.<br /><br />Everyone can relate to Marty McFly, hell I even did back when I was 17.
Unlike the sequels, which were watered down a bit. This film brings the new
wave &quot;MTV&quot; quality of the mid-80's back to a realistic 1955. The issue of
time and time paradox which is explained and demonstrated in the
sequels....well it's to much information to get into. <br /><br />Originally this film wasn't intended for sequels, then ending was a
joke.
