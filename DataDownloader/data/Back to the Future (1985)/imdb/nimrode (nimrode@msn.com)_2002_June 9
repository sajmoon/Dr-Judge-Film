2002_June 9 

This movie proves that even a relatively simple premise can become a
marvelous conceit if it is cleverly executed. There are not many mistakes
and everything from the script to the casting came together to make this a
signature film of the mid-eighties. I am not a big Michael J. Fox fan but
I
have to hand it to him here as he carries this film and makes it look easy
in the lead as Marty Mcfly--the 80's teen thrown back 30 years in time to
walk as stranger through his own hometown. There are some cartoonish
elements here (including the high school bully) but the manner and setting
of the picture is winning and the plot flows smoothly and evenly as Marty
hooks up with Doc (Chris Lloyd)to both go back to the eighties where he
came
from and to secure the future by helping his future father (C. Glover) win
his future mother (L. Thompson). The scene where Marty and Doc are hooking
up the mechanism (dependent on a chance lightning bolt) that is to propel
him back to the future is rather strangely ...touching..for reasons I
can't
quite figure out ---
