Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager in Hill Valley, California in
1985
- and then in 1955. Dr Emmett Brown's time machine has flung Marty 30
years
back in time and he's stranded there unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help
him.
Worse: Marty's own mother, here a high school teenager, is falling for him
instead of his father.<br /><br />It sounds like a clich&eacute;d science fiction movie that could only appeal to
fans of the genre - but that couldn't be more wrong. A huge hit, it
appealed
across the board for its invention, its exuberant energy, and the famous
finale - so tense, so very exciting and yet able to make you gasp and
laugh
at the same time.<br /><br />Looking back at it now, it seems less subtle than it did on release and
you
can't help but recognise how carefully the story sets out to manipulate
you.
Every scene, every line works but then later you see how you were set up:
nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later. That
should be terrible, but it's done so very well that it's a treat. It's
undeniably formulaic but so outstandingly executed that it vindicates the
formula.<br /><br />No surprise then that there were two sequels (and subsequent video
releases
of the film had the line &quot;To Be Continued&quot; added to the closing moments).
They are good but not quite to the standard of this gem.
