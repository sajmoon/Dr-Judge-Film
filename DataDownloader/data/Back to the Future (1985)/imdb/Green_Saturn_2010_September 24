A movie blessed by the talent of Steven Spielberg has to be good.
That&#x27;s what you expect Back to the Future to be. Good. No, no, This
movie is REALLY good.<br /><br />The whole idea of time travel is incredibly confusing, and for the most
part they try to explain all the technical stuff that&#x27;s going on as the
movie progresses. It&#x27;s really easy to screw up sci-fi movies and they
easily dodged failure.<br /><br />The plot was engaging. When it was theatrically released in 1985 I&#x27;m
sure it was funny. It. Still. Is. While the humor might be laughing at
how retro everything sounds at times, you still get a good laugh in
more than once.<br /><br />AND it has Michael J. Fox! Epic. Just epic. He&#x27;s got the best perplexed
face I&#x27;ve ever seen. And he makes the whole &#x22;time-traveling into 1955
business and almost splitting up my parents&#x22; business believable.<br /><br />A lot of funny moments. Clever, well-written and very, very enjoyable.
10 stars (I&#x27;d give 11 but you can only give 10!)
