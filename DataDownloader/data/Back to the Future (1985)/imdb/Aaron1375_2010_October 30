I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want
to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but
this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd
than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J.
Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if &#x22;Family Ties&#x22;
held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during
the 80&#x27;s and could have done more without the television commitment.
This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film
would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a
film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not
aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80&#x27;s, as fashion
is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy
use the professor&#x27;s time machine and ending back in the past where he
kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in
turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the
professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine,
which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his
parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you
can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn&#x27;t because you
can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though
was okay.
