Let me just say this out loud - THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE FROM
MY KID-HOOD!!! So cool, so different, so friggin' awesome. Marty Mcfly,
one of the slickest, most energetic and entertaining characters ever
brought to movie-life was forever Michael J. Fox's &quot;Christopher
Reeve-Superman&quot; thing, but the price wasn't too high, he's simply
irreplaceable in the trilogy. The exact same price-tag is also on
Christopher Lloyd's Dr. Emmett Brown, Crispin Glover, and the guy who
plays Biff. Don't even know his name, don't even care to, he's just
'Biff'.<br /><br />The music, the special effects, the sets, the Dolorean, heck the idea,
and the acting-they're all impeccable. Impeccable. I still write all
this after more than 14 years, but something that's usually stamped on
Robert Zemeckis's movies is perfection to details and just about
everything. Rarely does he fail at this, that's a consistence I admire
about him a lot! &quot;Back To The Future&quot; is still one of his best movies,
one of the best movies of the 80's, one of the best sci-fi movies, a
true marble, after 20 years it's holding on without even a struggle,
and is one of those eternal movies everybody who's into movies will see
for sure.<br /><br />9/10 Recommendations: if you don't at least like it I don't believe
you:)
