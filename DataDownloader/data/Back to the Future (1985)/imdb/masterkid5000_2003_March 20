I like the time machine! It was invented by Doc Brown. Marty, a 17 year
old
boy who has a nerdy family. When Biff was younger, he wanted to marry
Lloraine (which is Marty's mother). George Mcfly, who was getting picked
on
by Biff. Biff would say, &quot;Hello! Hello! Anybody home? Think Mcfly! Think!&quot;
This is the best film of the season!
