1999_October 17 

A true classic in the way The Karate Kid and Weird Science were classics
(Its just Back To the future is Better)
Great casting with Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox and great backup by
Lea Thompson.
A Film which you can watch more than once (unlike most films today) and
still be intrested.
Hill Valley Will never be the same!!<br /><br />9* out of 10, Sheer time traveling fun for everyone!
