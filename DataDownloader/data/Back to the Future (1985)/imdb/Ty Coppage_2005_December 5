Back to the Future is a classic. What more do you have to know. It had
just about everything you need in a great film. Marty Mcfly(Mike J.
Fox) is sent back in time to 1955. What a great year, even though my
parents weren't even born yet. Marty finds out that his mother &quot;has the
hots&quot; for him. What a plot! So, Marty must &quot;hook&quot; his mother with his
nerdy father, so everything in the future is A OK. Along the way in
1955, Marty gets in and out of trouble. Mostly with Biff, the high
school bully. In the end, the film comes out great. A great cast, and
music...if you like 1955 music. If you have not seen this film..you
have to be living on a different planet. BTTF is a film you will mostly
enjoy.
