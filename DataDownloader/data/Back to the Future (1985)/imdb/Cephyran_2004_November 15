I really like this movie. I mean, I really like this movie. I probably
first saw it when I was about ten, and it was the coolest thing I'd
seen. The concept of time travel is always intriguing, and Michael J
Fox and Christopher Lloyd seem to have an unbeatable 'student and
mentor' chemistry on screen. The story is very well-constructed, too.
Marty (Fox) is asked to join doc Brown (Lloyd) for a test run of his
new time machine, and through an unfortunate series of complications,
Marty ends up in the year 1955. To top things off, he may have
accidentally set history in a new direction - one that results with him
never being born. <br /><br />Not only is the movie fun to watch and well-written, but it just has
the atmosphere. A lot of the good movies have it. Its almost a state of
mind where you really get into the movie; you can feel the characters
going through their conflicts, and you break through that barrier that
says &quot;This is fiction.&quot;<br /><br />Back to the Future is definitely in my top favorite 25 movies ever, and
I adamantly recommend this to fans of the genre, the cast...really, a
fan of anything will like it, just because it has so much.
