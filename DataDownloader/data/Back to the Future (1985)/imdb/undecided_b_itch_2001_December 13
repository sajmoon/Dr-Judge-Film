I think Michael J. Fox is really adorable, and I can watch &quot;Back to the
Future&quot; and its sequel (haven't seen 3) a million times back to back. I
wouldn't take up too much space with my comment, just that &quot;Back to the
Future&quot; is very well-paced, well-acted, well-written and very interesting.
In addition to all that, it's hilarious. Plainly put, it's the perfect
popcorn movie for a boring Saturday night, and just about whenever one feels
listless and wants to be entertained. <br /><br />I really liked Doc. He's like this weird fireball type who's really cute and
eccentric in his own way, and Christopher Lloyd has wonderful chemistry with
Michael J. Fox. And is it just me, or does he look just a little bit like
Einstein...? <br /><br />
