Extremely enjoyable family movie. It is a classic time travel story and this
film is the best of the series. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both
fantastic and they get good support from Lea Thompson, James Tolkan and a
hilarious Thomas F Wilson as Biff. This is charming fantasy fun with great
time and effort gone into creating the different time periods. It's a
fantastically engaging story. <br /><br />What marks this above many other time-travel films is the superb script. The
little touches throughout are superb and this truly is a film you can watch
over again many times over and pick up new things you didn't notice before.
The film also has a fantastic soundtrack. *****
