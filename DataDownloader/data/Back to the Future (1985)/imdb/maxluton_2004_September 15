Alright can someone explain this concept or paradox to me- This comes
from near the end of the 1st movie. Marty has decided to set his return
time earlier than the time he originally departed. This is so that he
can warn the Doctor of his coming death. The thing is when he does this
and gets to the car park because he's late, he sees the attack taking
place from a 3rd person view and he sees himself get into the time
machine and drive into 1955. If Marty, was able to get there in time to
warn the Doctor and they managed to avoid the attack, what would have
happened in 1985 because we would have had 2 Marty(s), from 1985, since
Marty who jumped in the machine would not have had to go to 1955?
