After viewing all 3 (and I still love them after all these years) it&#x27;s
just so obvious the franchise is every bit as &#x22;alive&#x22; as the time
circuitry and flux capacitor although Marty McFly of course for all the
right storyline reasons pronounces it &#x22;dead.&#x22;<br /><br />I hope Spielberg/Zemeckis decides to leave the property, all possible
licenses to continue the story -very dead. But although most fans
disagree with me, I totally of am the strong opinion Zemeckis/Gale
highlighted the (in joke of in jokes) &#x22;broken&#x22; flux capacitor that
well, isn&#x27;t really dead but yes, broken but ... har har.. in any future
sequels ...even more quirky when used with the wholly intact Mr.
Fusion. Remember - Mr. Fusion operates the time circuitry and flux
capacitor. The mode of transportation is of no consequence. Only that
&#x22;it&#x22; achieves 88 mph. <br /><br />It&#x27;s my personal wish that this series ends. But the 80s are now our
current &#x22;Happy Days/Wonder Years/That 70s Show.&#x22; Will they cash in for
that reason and a few others? Without including Michael J. Fox and I
just don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible given his condition, just leave it
an 80s American cultural icon. Anyone selling a DeLorean cheap?
