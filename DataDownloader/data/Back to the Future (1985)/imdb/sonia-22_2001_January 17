There is not much that you can say about this movie, aside from the fact
that it is one of the best movies. The cast is terrific, the scenes, the
music and the concepts. Christopher Lloyd gives out a great performance as
the eccentric scientist, Michael J Fox is believable as the clueless
teenager from the future, Lea Thompson as the girl and mother is worthy of
note, and Crispin Glover as George McFly gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to all fans of the science fiction
genre.
