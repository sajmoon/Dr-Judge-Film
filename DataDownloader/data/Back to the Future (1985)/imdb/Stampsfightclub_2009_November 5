Marty McFly (Fox) is sent back in time to the year 1955 where he must
make sure his parents meet and fall in love, otherwise his existence is
in danger.<br /><br />This renowned Oscar winning sci-fi has everything you need for a
entertaining viewing, whether with family or a quiet solo night in.
Action, comedy and adventure this ticks all the right boxes and is a
film we can look at and say is a fine depiction of time travelling
mischief and bravery.<br /><br />There have been numerous films to attempt to unravel the complexity of
time travel. From The Terminator to the Butterfly effect we have robots
and unexplained seizures telling a theory on how travelling through the
void can happen.<br /><br />In this 1985 release the complexity of the lexis is weighed down to a
comedy level to fit the mood of the moment, and through the wonderfully
buoyant Emmet Brown we see his theory of the flux-capacitor and the use
of plutonium to achieve the unachievable is brilliant appreciation of
the target audience. There is no over the top scientific knowledge as
we take Dr Brown as he is an overly knowledgeable protagonist, and
doesn&#x27;t Christopher Lloyd do well? The star shows a very eccentric
style to portray a subtle madness and delicious exuberance to deliver
one wonderful mad scientist that gives the film, and trilogy, its main
source of comedy and resourcefulness.<br /><br />Lets not forget Michael J Fox in arguably his most profound role from
his illustrious career as the unbelievably cool teen who gets wrapped
up in events. Fox&#x27;s appreciation for cool is never over the top and
fits even today&#x27;s modern teenage stereotype. But to associate him with
today would be unfair. He is way too cool for any kind of label. He
skateboards, he has an attractive girlfriend, he plays the guitar and
drinks Pepsi, what more can you say? He is the coolest kid in time.<br /><br />Whilst the plot is easy to enjoy and relaxing unconditional fun there
is a level of importance of attention to be maintained as the plot&#x27;s
intention of science bases itself on a few key rules. Such as what can
alter the future, saying the wrong thing and the difference from the
present and the future. All run however thoroughly and with plenty of
zest and humour to satisfy any viewer&#x27;s entertainment requirements.<br /><br />The opening sequence with the clocks is fantastic panning and good
timing (no pun intended) as Marty enters and blasts the stereo. This
sets the tone for the coolness of the main character and builds
everything around the complexity of time.<br /><br />This really is fantastic fun with wonderful characters and a springy
adventurous minded script that never hinders on the past, not literally
obviously. Parts II and III are well balanced fun, but this was where
it all started and what a fantastic beginning it was
