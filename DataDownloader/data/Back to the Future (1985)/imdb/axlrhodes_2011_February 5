Robert Zemeckis&#x27; Back To The Future is a highly entertaining, well
imagined classic of a blockbuster. The 80&#x27;s spawned a rich variety of
franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one
of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the
performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on
special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the
actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to
Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to
perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is
outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950&#x27;s well realised
and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis&#x27; last film
Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining
popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly
energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember.
