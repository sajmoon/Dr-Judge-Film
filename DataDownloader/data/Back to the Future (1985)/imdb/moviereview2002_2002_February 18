I saw this movie when I was little. It was my FAVORITE movie ever then.
And
the next time I see it, I'm sure I'll think it's still the
best.<br /><br />The film was superb. I watched it when I was only 4 years old (thats 5
years ago) and I still remember it like it was just yesterday.<br /><br />I truly think you should watch it, too. It is fun for the whole family.So
when you watch it, sit back and enjoy!
