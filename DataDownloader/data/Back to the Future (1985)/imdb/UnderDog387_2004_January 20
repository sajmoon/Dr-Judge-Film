This movie/trilogy is probably the best ever created, especially for a
DeLorean freak...except for the third part where they destroy it. If you
haven't seen any of them, sorry, didn't mean to ruin it for you. If you
ever
wonder what it might be like to travel in time, watch this, because it
might
just be pretty accurate (yeah, right). Anyone who hasn't seen this movie
ought to.
