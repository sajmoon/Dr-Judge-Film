I think my one line summary sums this film up straight away, i have been
watching this movie since i was about 7 or 8 years old and now im almost
20
and im still watching it and loving every minute of it and even though i
know whats gonna happen next everytime i watch it, i simply dont care as
its
that classy a film, this film is living proof that a simple idea, a great
script and some good and some slightly unknown actors can make a film that
will stand the test of time even watching it now i keep have to remind
myself it was made in 1985!!!! I know thats when its set and everything
but
to me the hallmark of a good film is that no matter when it was made it
still seems like new.<br /><br />Michael J Fox was the perfect choice for this role as he was new and was
great at the teenager who got caught up in the middle of everything and
had
to get his parents together, this film launched his career and rightly so.
Christopher Lloyd as the manic Doc Brown, pure class, whoever choose him
deserves every award going plus a few medals as well for good measure, hes
ace, great as the mad scientist and gets more and more funny as the
trilogy
goes on. Thomas F Wilson as the bully Biff(what a name haha!) who picks on
everyone, including his father to brilliant comedic effect, wish i could
have seen more of this guy in bigger films after this one as i think given
the chance he could have been one of the big guns in america, but hey what
do i know right.<br /><br />I cannot be bothered going through the rest of this, just go and watch
this
movie, if you havent seen it, rent or buy it, if you have got it watch it,
if you are from another country and cant understand this get it translated
ok.  This film will be great even in a 100 years time its still great
after
17 years out there and there arent many people who dont like this film and
theres a reason for this.
