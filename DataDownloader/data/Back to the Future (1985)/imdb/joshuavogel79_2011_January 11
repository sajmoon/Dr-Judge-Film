This is movie magic at its finest.<br /><br />This movie is is fun, funny, captivating, enthralling, suspenseful and
all around amazing.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are perfect in this movie, and the
supporting cast are spectacular as well. Huge shout out to Tom Wilson
who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.<br /><br />Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not
without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of
character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover&#x27;s performance
may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this
movie).<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You
may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the
contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I
think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if
people will still appreciate its subtleties. <br /><br />In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I&#x27;ve ever watched. Perfect,
happy, blissful escapism. Movie magic. Pure movie magic.
