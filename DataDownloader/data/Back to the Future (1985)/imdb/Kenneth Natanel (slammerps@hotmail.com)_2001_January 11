It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality,
and
is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another. A classic
fish out of water story. I think what makes this movie so great is the
people involved.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis is one of the best sci-fi directors of our time. It's
funny
how it takes a big budget movie like Cast Away (2000) to make people take
notice.<br /><br />FOX &amp; LLoyd should win the nobel prize for chemistry. Brown is overexcited
in his speeches, and his exaggerated facial expressions put Vince
McMahon's
(WWF) to shame.<br /><br />And Thomas Willson (BIFF) &amp; Crispin Glover (George McFly) gave it their
all,
including possibly the best performances of their life.<br /><br />Back to the future is one of those movies where you believe in the
characters, as much comic book as they are, and as hard as you try, you
just
can't pick a favorite. It's a popcorn movie that can be watched over and
over again. And every time you watch it you will notice something you
didn't
spot before (check out the imdb trivia for this one).<br /><br />Pete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 1.21 jigawatts<br /><br />What the hell's a jigawatt?? Better than a 10, if thats
possible!
