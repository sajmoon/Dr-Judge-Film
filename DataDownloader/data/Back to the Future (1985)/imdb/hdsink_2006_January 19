This movie came out just a year after I graduated high school, and by
then I had seen many movies of many genres. Back to the Future was, in
my opinion, not only well written, but also well acted. This is
definitely a classic for anyone who is a collector.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly has befriended an eccentric scientist
whom he calls, &quot;Doc.&quot; The scientist is one zany actor, Christopher
Lloyd. The two are a wonderful pair. If any of you remember, Michael
was in Family Ties, and Christopher was in Taxi. Brilliant actors, and
a brilliant unfolding script.<br /><br />What makes this movie so wonderful is that it isn't exactly
predictable. You will be on the edge of your seats if you tend to get
wrapped up in a move. I know I thought I had it solved in the first
fifteen minutes as I usually do, but no! There are many details that
would tend to escape the untrained eye for the two sequels to follow.<br /><br />If you are going to watch this movie, then be prepared for the next
two. They are the filler for this. And like I said, pay attention to
everything.
