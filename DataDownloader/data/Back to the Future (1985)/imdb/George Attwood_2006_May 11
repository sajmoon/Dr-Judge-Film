BACK TO THE FUTURE **** Seventeen-year-old Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)
gets in way over his head when he travels back in time to the 1950s
era. Upon friend/crazed scientist Doc. Emmed Brown (Christopher Lloyd)
contriving a modernistic time-machine, Marty drives it only to find
himself unexpectedly placed thirty years back in history. When he
accidentally interferes with his then-teenage parents&#39; chance meeting,
he may ultimately have severed the outcome of them wedding and birthing
him. Of course, the hilarity of the situation Marty enters into is what
&#39;Back To The Future&#39; hinges on for comedic support and relief, and
Robert Zemekis scores a touchdown by forming and putting to life the
idea.
