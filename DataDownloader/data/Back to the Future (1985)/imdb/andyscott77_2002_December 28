I watched this again recently.  I hadn't seen it in years.  The story is
still entertaining after all these years.  Christopher Lloyd was genius as
Doc, Crispin Glover plays a great George McFly and of course Michael J. Fox
as Marty.  All actors were wonderful.  If you haven't seen this movie in a
while, rent it, especially if you had your adolescence in the 80's, at the
very least, you'll be able to say &quot;ohmygosh!  look at the hair on those
people!!!&quot;.  Great film, perfect score.
