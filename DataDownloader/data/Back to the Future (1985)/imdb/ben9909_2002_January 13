After i saw this movie, i really have enjoyed watching Michael J.Fox's
productions and movies, he just had that cliche that was both entertaining
and brought that extra &quot;oomph&quot; into a film.<br /><br />An excellent story line was the trick here, The element of &quot;What if...&quot;?
It
is everyones fanatasy to go back and see when their Mother and Father met,
knowing that from that moment they were ment for each other. The element
of
romance, close calls, the ugly duckling nursery rhyme theme, comedy,
suspense and that touch of drama were the ingredients that made Back To
The
Future a non-stop adrenaline ride. Though it takes it a while to get the
started, its pace keeps hounding until the fimal scene. Excellent cast,
stand out performance by Crispin Glover, and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox
excellent as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd as the excentric Doc Brown
made this movie golden. If you havent seen it, do yourself a favor - go
see
it, you'll be glad you did, it will make you want to get Back to the
future
over and over again.<br /><br />A fantastic storyline and excellent direction, a dynamic
cast.<br /><br />*****&quot;OUTOF&quot;*****<br /><br />Terrific
