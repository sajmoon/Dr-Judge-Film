Time travel epic for the twentieth century. Although this movie actually
produced in the late 80's and early 90's, the special effects have shown it
inner strength. I have been seeing this movie for couple of time and finally
I can get it rented on DVD. I can't find any really huge extra on it such as
`Behind the Scenes' or `Outtakes'. Maybe the distributor should consider
include this one as BTTF is a very entertaining science fiction movie ever
produced.
