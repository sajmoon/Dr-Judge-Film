A film about how moments in time can be changed if a different path is
taken.  Back to the Future(1985) is about a young man who travels back in
time to see what it was like in 1955.  Michael J. Fox is one of the best
things in the movie because he portrays with a hunger for curosity.  Back to
the Future(1985) is the best and most famous film in the career of Michael
J. Fox.  Christopher Lloyd is wacky as the eccentric scientist, Dr. Brown. 
There is a scene in this movie that is inspired by Terry Gilliam's
Brazil(1985).  Lea Thompson is just sweet natured and shy as Marty McFly's
future mother, Lorraine Baines.  Back to the Future(1985) which besides Who
Framed Roger Rabbit(1988) is a terrific film from director, Robert Zemeckis.
