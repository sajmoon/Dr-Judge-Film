I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's 
cinema,&quot;Back to the Future&quot; comes amazingly close.It has
laughs,
AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the
attention
paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start
of
the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the &quot;Twin
Pines
Mall&quot;.Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently
runs
over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the
end,
after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is
something
you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I
have.
Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the
unforgettable
Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B.
Goode
sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and
the
attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to
perfect
as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This
is the only one of the trilogy you need to see.
