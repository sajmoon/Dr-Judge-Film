When I first saw this movie, it was the first time I saw Michael J. Fox act,
not having ever watched &quot;Family Ties.&quot;  He is so funny and believable as
Marty, a cool kid in a nerdy family, who works part-time for the local kooky
scientist, Dr. Brown (played to the hilt by Christopher Lloyd--what a
perfect choice for this role).  Dr. Brown accidentally sends Marty back to
the 1950's where he runs into his parents and havoc ensues, because his
presence prevents them from having their first meeting and threatens his
very existence!  Crispin Glover was absolutely fantastic as the goofy father
you wish you never had. (And Marty's reactions under his breath, &quot;my god,
it's a wonder I was ever born&quot;--equally hysterical.) I am unfamiliar with
the actor who played Biff, the high school bully, but his echoing &quot;butthead&quot;
throughout the movie had my entire family laughing.  This film is just
great, well done from start to finish, with a lot of attention to little
details.  It's the kind of film you can slip into the VCR and everyone
watches and laughs all over again.
