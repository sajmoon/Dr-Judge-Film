This is probably one the greatest movies I have ever seen! I mean, I LOVE
time travel, and just the thought of someone doing it is enough for me to
watch a movie. But the manner in which this movie did it in was AMAZING!<br /><br />Going back to the 1950's, altering the past, attempting to fix it and
telling the Doc his future were all integral parts to the entire foundation
of the movie. This is definitely a winner! There is a lot of magic in this
fast-paced fantasy. I strongly recommend this modern-day classic if you have
not yet seen it. If you have, it's always a top-choice when renting movies.<br /><br />10/10, no doubt.
