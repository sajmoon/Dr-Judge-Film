Unbelievable. A delight from start to finish. Accurate paradoxical
statements, enjoyable and extremely clever script-writing and an underlying
comedy theme make this the 'Back To The Future' series the best film trilogy
of all time. Top acting from Thomas Wilson, Michael J Fox and Christopher
Lloyd. A film way ahead of its time!
