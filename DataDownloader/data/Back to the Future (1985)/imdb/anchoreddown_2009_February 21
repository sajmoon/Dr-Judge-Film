Who doesn&#39;t remember growing up watching the Back To The Future
Trilogy???? Since July 3, 1985 when the first film was released, fans
from all walks of life can recall Hollywood history through the eyes of
Marty Mcfly as he travels through time in the plutonium powered
Delorean. The following fans are really the people to thank for keeping
the BTTF trilogy alive. With numerous props, books, DVDs, VHS tapes,
vintage McDonald toys, the eBay world is THE place to shop BTTF aside
the online store from the direct web site. In the pilot film, Doc Brown
introduces the Delorean time machine as the choice machine for time
travel. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty Mcfly, the teenager who goes
back,..... to 1955 where he meets his parents to be. Interfering with
their first meeting, Marty must fix the relationship with the help of
Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown and get back to 1985 in time. From start to
finish, fans all agree that Back To The Future is one of the largest
film icons of the 1980s.
