Saw this movie last time at the age of 8....<br /><br />now i&#39;m 27 years old!<br /><br />I had so much fun watching the whole trilogy again..even more like with
the whole bunch of American movies i&#39;ve been watching this year, just
bought the DVD-Box with all three parts &amp; it&#39;s AWESOME to watch these
ones again!! Even more awesome like the first time i went to the
movies. And I&#39;ve been watching all 3 of &#39;em in a row.. HILARIOUS!! THIS
IS Hollywood at its best! And in one thing i&#39;m sure: a 4th part could
never be done without Michael J. Fox..and never with. When you see this
movie you think he never seems to get old. he could even play a
teenager 10 years after finishing the 1st part! But for some reason
some of the most gorgeous human beings have to get an illness that
can&#39;t be cured... this fact is disgusting but you can&#39;t even do
anything against it - what a pity...this movie is a part of
Hollywood-History!!!
