One of the best movies ever to graced earth in form of a TRILOGY.<br /><br />Most people wouldn&#x27;t even stop to think about it. But this Movie Is
full of Depth meanings, Richfull moments and serious things aside from
the Wonderful Adventure, Special FX, Characters, acting skills it can
certainly provide the viewer. We are looking at one simple damn good
script from Bob gale and Zemeckis.<br /><br />We are getting one Fabulous Soundtrack From Master Alan Silvestri. And
most of all we are lighted by the most wonderful characters,
heartwarming and human there could be. Time travel Story About A kid
who accidentally go back to the time their parents met. And attempting
to go back to his own time, he discovers he can make things better...<br /><br />This is Back to the Future, An all time adventure, a classic, And a
film that tries to show you that no matter how hard things in your life
can turn out... There is always a chance to make it right; to change
them... Because, Future is not written yet.
