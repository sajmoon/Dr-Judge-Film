2012_March 7 
&#x22;Back to the Future&#x22; is my favorite movie of all time. Now, in 2012,
I&#x27;m 25 years old and I remember the day I saw it for the first time. I
was seven years old and it was a rainy Saturday afternoon. In those
cases, my parents used to rent a movie for my younger brother and me.
And this Saturday, my mom came home with &#x22;Back to the Future&#x22;. Maybe it
sounds crazy or unbelievable, but I can recall the emotion I felt when
the movie ended. It was like, deep inside, I knew that I had just seen
a movie which couldn&#x27;t fit any better to me as a person. It was like I
knew that this movie instantly became my favorite movie of my life and
in the years to come, there wouldn&#x27;t be any movie which can do the same
thing to me. Strange perhaps, that someone can &#x27;link&#x27; a movie to one&#x27;s
personality. But now I don&#x27;t know any other way to put it. &#x22;Back to the
Future&#x22; is a gem. It&#x27;s perfect and genius in all ways and, part of the
personal connection I have with it, I think it&#x27;s one of the best movies
ever made.
