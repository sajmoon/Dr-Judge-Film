This summary perfectly describes my feeling after seeing this movie.<br /><br />The movie is pure....genius. The plot is entertaining till the last
minute, the great effects, the exceptional acting from Michael J. Fox
and Christopher Lyod.<br /><br />This movie has great qualities for any sci-fi fan. Time-travel,
alternate-universes, and DELOREANS! Furthermore, there is little to no
errors in the film. There may only be a irk or two in the plot, but it
still doesn&#x27;t take away from the incredible film experience that Steven
Spielberg chose to call &#x22;Back to The Future&#x22;! <br /><br />An easy 10/10!
