Outrageously good. It&#39;s such a good film that it&#39;s almost difficult to
say why... you want to praise the concept, but wonder if that&#39;s just
because of the design. Is the acting ace or is it the script doing all
the good stuff? Is it intentionally funny and moving at the same time
or is that to do with the brilliant score?<br /><br />Michael J Fox hasn&#39;t done anything better than this (it&#39;s an
embarrassment of riches that Teenwolf came out the same year). His
characteristic, unselfconscious perpetual movement is perfectly suited
to a film combining metaphysical insanity with a race against time.
Christopher Lloyd pulls off the &#39;unhinged... but not mad&#39; trick
brilliantly. We get a DeLorean defying the laws of physics, for
goodness sake.<br /><br />A seamlessly woven series of set pieces (from a master of that art
Robert Zemeckis) adding up to the quintessential youngster&#39;s matin&eacute;e.
9/10
