i remember watching this film when i was young during christmas and i
remember thinking this is good. i bought the whole trilogy the other month
and my opinion hasnt changed in the slightest. michael j fox is outstanding
as the typical american school kid. his mockery and his comments throughout
the film is the where the humour is. crispin glover is also great as the
handsome but kinda geeky school kid destined to fall in love with his school
sweetheart. his voice and movements give it that feel good feeling. overall
this film cheers me up when i feel blue.  great. great film
