Back to the Future is a great ride. It's funny, it's touching and it's
thrilling. I have watched this film over and over again and it never failed
to impress me with it's charms. It started a trilogy that became one of the
best loved and most succesful series' of all time. I really love this
movie.<br /><br />Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is a typical teenager living in 1985
California. But he has got a couple of problems. He has a great band, but
nobody gives him a chance. His parents are losers and his dad gets pushed
around by hig-school bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is now his
boss. Marty has ambition, but he doesn't want to turn out like his parents.
But one night, he agrees to meet his friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in
a mall parking lot at 2 am. What could be so important? Well, Doc has just
invented a time machine! But they are attacked by terrorists that have been
ripped off by Doc and Marty inavertenly travels 30 years back in time! Now,
in 1955, he meets his parents and disaster strikes! Marty's mom is in love
with him and his dad is still a loser. With the help of the Doc from 1955,
he must repair the time machine, get his parents to fall in love, and get
back to the future, or he's history!<br /><br />This movie sparkles with charm from the performances of all the cast.
Micheal J. Fox is absolutley perfect as Marty and Christopher Lloyd displays
amazing comedic talent in his role and it amazes me how criminally
unappreciated he is. I also have to mention that Crispin Glover, Lea
Thompson and Wilson are terrific.<br /><br />Back to the Future is very, very funny. It has lots of in-jokes to other
movies and Fox and Lloyd are given some great dialogue by Robert Zemeckis
and Bob Gale, who wrote the script. I am astonished how much a laugh every
time I see this movie, even for the ump-teenth time. <br /><br />With credit to the visual effects and a great score, I think everyone will
find Back to the Future a pinnacle in the careers of Zemeckis and Steven
Spielberg and love it for the unmistakeable movie magic that it holds. I
know I do.
