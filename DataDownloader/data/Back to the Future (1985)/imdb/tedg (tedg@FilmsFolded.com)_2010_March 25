This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his
insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed
me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?<br /><br />Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in
all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the
Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.<br /><br />I think I will remember two films: this one and &#x22;Roger Rabbit.&#x22; These
both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that
played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? <br /><br />It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain
conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by
itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the
same package works well. Makes this a gem.<br /><br />Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe
smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have
here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy.
An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense
of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to
explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.<br /><br />The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as
instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head
getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted
terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by
Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.<br /><br />Ted&#x27;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
