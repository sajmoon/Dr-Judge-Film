2002_December 1 

I first saw this movie when I was just a little kid and I absolutely
loved
it.  In the time that's passed since that day, I've seen it again and
again
(probably about fifty times), and I love it more and more with each
viewing.
I think that alone is a testament to its power; I've never been bored by
it
once and I don't think I ever will be.<br /><br />Top to bottom, everything in this movie works.  From the acting to the
directing to the story to the music to the visual effects, it's quite
simply
the most enjoyable movie experience I can imagine.  Really, I think this
is
what movies should be all about--watching some moving pictures and having
fun.  That's the best word to describe &quot;Back to the Future.&quot;
Fun.<br /><br />So if you've never seen this movie before, don't take my word for it (I'm
not qualified enough for you to do that).  Just go out and rent it and
watch
it and enjoy it and watch it again.  You owe it to yourself.<br /><br />I know I'll see it again in the future.  You mean the past?
Whatever.
