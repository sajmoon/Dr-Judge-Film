2000_May 30 

Let me first start by saying I have seen a lot of movies and am a self
proclaimed &quot;Movie Geek&quot; and of all the movies I've seen, I'd say beyond a
shadow of a doubt this is my favorite. Truth be told I consider the whole
trilogy to be one movie and consider this to be a classic that will be
cherished for many many years to come.
There is a certain light-hearted, feel good quality in this movie that
you just don't see anymore. It's of good moral fiber and the Directing has
a
crisp, sleek quality to it. The acting is perfectly attuned to the genre
and
the story is larger than life and the most original to come along in years.<br /><br />The dictionary defines the word &quot;Classic&quot; as &quot;something that outlives
it's anticipated duration&quot;. Back to the Future has certainly done that and
will continue to appeal to audiences of all ages through out the course of
the future. Just like the Proverbial &quot;Bolt of Lightning&quot; that struck the
clock tower, BTTF hit audiences across the nation and has forever changed
the course of movie making history.
