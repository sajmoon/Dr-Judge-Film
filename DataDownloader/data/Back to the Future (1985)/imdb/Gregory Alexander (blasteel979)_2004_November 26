Back To The Future obviously had a lot of time put into it. It was
unbelievable. I know a lot of people who have seen this movie, and not
one of them gave it bad feedback. Every one of them said it was great,
or it was one of their favorites. I have seen this movie many many
times, and I have noticed every little catch they have thrown in for
fun. That is probably why this is my favorite movie. Not just this one
but the sequels as well.<br /><br />I give this movie a 14 out of 10!!!!
