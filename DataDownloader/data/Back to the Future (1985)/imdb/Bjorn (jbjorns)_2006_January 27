Quite simply the most entertaining time-travel movie ever. The story is
magnificent all the way, expertly written with some of the most
memorable dialog ever to grace the silver screen. It's lighthearted
approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not
least the cast is the best.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is
even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel.
Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been
lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson
proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).<br /><br />Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film
is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never
sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future
has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.<br /><br />Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it. This is timeless
entertainment and in light of recent comedies one can better appreciate
the level of fun this movie provides. They simply don't make 'em like
this anymore.
