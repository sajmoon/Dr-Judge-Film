Any time this movie is on, I get sucked in. This movie is easily the most
durable of any that I can think of. The only close competition for
durability would be the Shawshank Redemption. This is one of those movies
that I would see at the theater again, if they were to show it on the big
screen! I would recommend this for kids too, because it is timeless. Or
wait, it isn't timeless, it is full of time.
