This is a memorable sci-fi comedy that will always be remembered for it's
amazing visual effects and dolorian time machine.  Plot (if actually
memorable) is about a regular teen (Michael J. Fox in one of his best
performances) who is friends with a brilliant yet crazed doc (Christopher
Lloyd is terrific as this Doc) who creates a time machine using a flux
capasitor and 1.21 gigawots (what the hell is a giawot!).  But suddenly,
McFly finds himself in 1955, 30 years earlier to his present date.  And not
only does he have to get back to the future, he also has to reunite his
parents after a incident.  Great fun with this cast and tale, with some
great direction by Robert Zemeckis and from Steven Spielberg's Amblin
entertainment.  The best one of the trilogy (though the other 2 are
questionable).  A+
