If any film endeared MICHAEL J. FOX to movie audiences, it was BACK TO
THE FUTURE (&#39;85). He was an inspired choice to play Marty McFly, who
meets up with crazy wizard scientist Doc Brown (CHRISTOPHER LLOYD) and
finds himself living in small-town USA circa 1955 where he discovers
that he must arrange a match between his parents who haven&#39;t yet
connected.<br /><br />Lloyd plays Doc with wild-eyed enthusiasm, a stroke of genius for such
an over-the-top kind of role. Completely in harmony with him is CRISPIN
GLOVER as Marty&#39;s nerdy father, a joy to watch as he completely becomes
this character. Then too, an added source of enjoyment is LEAH THOMPSON
as Marty&#39;s mother/girlfriend who takes part in some of the most
innocently funny &quot;incest&quot; routines ever--and somehow, none of it
manages to offend. It&#39;s all played for laughs and all of it works.<br /><br />Discovering that another actor originally started the Marty role and
was then tossed aside (he was too intense and felt uncomfortable in the
role), it&#39;s a wise decision that found MICHAEL J. FOX landing the role
and keeping the whole story fresh, funny and innocent. He&#39;s an actor
who tells you with his whole body what he is thinking--and his
expressive face gets quite a workout when the plot thickens.<br /><br />My favorite time travel movie has the wildest climax imaginable, all
very clever and full of inventive surprises. Don&#39;t miss this one.<br /><br />And last but not least: Thomas F. Wilson makes a great &quot;Biff&quot;, the town
bully whose mere physical presence threatens to dominate many a scene.<br /><br />All of the action is directed at a frantic pace by Robert Zemeckis.
