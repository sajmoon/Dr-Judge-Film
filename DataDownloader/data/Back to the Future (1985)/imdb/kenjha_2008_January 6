In this entertaining sci-fi comedy, a young man is inadvertently sent
back 30 years via a time machine (a Delorean car) and unwittingly
interferes with the mating of his parents, thereby putting his future
in jeopardy. The plot is silly and full of holes, but it is fun to
watch. Most of the characters are stereotypes that seem to have stepped
out of sitcoms. Fox became a star with this film and Thompson is good
as his mother. This was an early success for the talented Zemeckis, who
keeps the action moving at a fast clip. The scenes leading to the trip
back to the future are very exiting and well executed. This film was a
huge success and was followed by a couple of sequels.
