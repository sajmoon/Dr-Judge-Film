The first in the triology from the Speilberg stable.<br /><br />This is a fun, well thought out adventure led by Michael J Fox, who always
has that charm to make a movie entertaining.<br /><br />Fox, as Marty McFly, inadvertently stops his parents from meeting after
being transported back to the 1950's. From this lies three movies which
build upon each other for an enjoyable trilogy of time line
mayhem.<br /><br />Fox brings a fun element to a slacker teenager, thrown into a life or death
quest that determines his own destiny. Lloyd, as the eccentric professor,
makes a marvelous partner to the time bandits; and Thomas Wilson makes a
bully that I think we all met in our younger days.<br /><br />Back To The Future is one of those films that marks a time in cinema. It
took four years for the sequels to follow, but they needed the time to match
the wit and pace of the first.
