I loved this film when as a kid, but childhood favourites often disappoint
when you revisit them.<br /><br />However, after a recent repeat TV viewing, the phrase &quot;don't make 'em like
they used to&quot; came to mind. This is such an entertaining, quirky and funny
film, and with so much charm, that you can't help rooting for the hero
throughout.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox pitch their performances perfectly, and
as a grown man I now understand why I had such a crush on Lea
Thompson<br /><br />Even the special effects hold up well after nearly 20 years.
