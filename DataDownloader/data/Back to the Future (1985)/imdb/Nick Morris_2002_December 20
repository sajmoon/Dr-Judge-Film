The first of the Back To The Future trilogy, and this one delivers. As a
family movie it offers satisfaction on every front. Michael J Fox is
perfectly cast as Marty McFly, the typical American teenager, falling in
love and falling into the adventure of his life. His wild and whacky
friend
Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, builds a time machine, out of a
Delorean, and soon Marty is back in 1955, where he disrupts his parents
first meeting and falling in love. The ensuing romp is amusing and
engaging
on all levels. You hate the bad guy for all the right reasons and cheer
Marty on as he struggles to set things right so his parents will fall in
love and he can get back to the future. You would have to be a cold
hearted
cynic not to enjoy this one. If you haven't seen it yet, DO!!
10/10
