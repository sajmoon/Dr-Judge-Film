1998_October 5 

When I read the title for the very first time I knew 'this is MY movie' and
it still is. I watched it over 25 times. Back To The Future is the most
wonderful movie I've ever seen, the whole Trilogy that is. Watching it over
and over is well worth, cause you'll always discover something new. There
are so many, many great details. That's what makes this movie so fantastic.
It's so well thought out.
