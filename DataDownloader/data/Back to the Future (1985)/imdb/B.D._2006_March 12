Anyone who wants to become a director or writer should see this movie.
It's an adventure that seems so plausible simply by the way the entire
idea is executed.<br /><br />Michael J Fox secured his position as one of the great comedic actors
-- flawless and understated as the typical teen Marty McFly. In fact,
the entire cast from Christopher Lloyd to Mark McClure to Wendie Jo
Sperber, Leah Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F Wilson (as Biff,
the dim witted bully), the performances are engaging and memorable. <br /><br />The story itself may seem simple, but the layers involved, tying
present and past in a way that it both further and enriches the story,
but never to be cute or clever. The direction, writing, performances,
production design and attention to the story first and foremost made
this move a timeless classic.
