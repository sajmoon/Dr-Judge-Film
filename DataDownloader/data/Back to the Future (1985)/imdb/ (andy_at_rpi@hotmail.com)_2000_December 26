This movie works for one reason only.  Michael J Fox plays the
perfect
underdog: a bumbling (borderline moronic at times) high schooler who not
only gets to save the day, beat up the bully, skateboard like a champ,
rock
out with chuck berry's kin, and not only save, but improve the future.
And
oh yeah, he gets the girl and the car of his dreams.  All this at the
price
of a minor oedipal complex.
