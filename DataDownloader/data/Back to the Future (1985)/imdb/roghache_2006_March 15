This is a great fun movie, the best of the time travel genre, other
than the more serious Star Trek themes.<br /><br />It's the wild and zany tale of 17 year old Marty McFly (that can't be a
real last name, surely?) who teams up with your typical mad scientist
and inventor of time travel, Doc Brown, resulting in Marty going back
in time to 1955 and maybe even preventing his parents from meeting.
Obviously something to be avoided at all costs if you'd like to be
born.<br /><br />The plot twists, quirks, and spins are too numerous to delve into here,
but they'll keep you riveted to your seat and laughing your head off.
The lead actors are both wonderful in their roles... the always
incredible Michael J. Fox as Marty, and Christopher Lloyd suitably
crazy as the crackpot time travel scientist. He ('the Doc', as Marty
calls him) is just so wonderfully nutty and wacky, and what I most
remember from this movie. <br /><br />The whole thing's absolutely tremendous fun for all ages, lots of both
action adventure and humor, the very essence of ridiculous. It's a real
blast INTO the past.
