OK this my first movie review so don&#x27;t be going mad if i don&#x27;t talk
about everything. OK the plot is about this teenager named Marty who&#x27;s
life is going pretty good he as a girlfriend who i forget her name and
hes friends with a man called doc brown who never invented anything
useful except a time machine which takes Marty back to 1955 and hes has
to get back to his present time. think that would be enough to base the
movie around but no he accidentally stops his parents from meeting .OK
you think you think that&#x27;s enough he as to stop the doc from being shot
my head gets dizzy from thinking about it and i forget the bully biff
he is my favorite bad guy of all time and he is such a asshole
