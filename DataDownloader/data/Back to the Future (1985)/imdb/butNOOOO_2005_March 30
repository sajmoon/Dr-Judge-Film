Oh my gosh, this movie is so awesome! With hilarious quotes that
everyone can remember, 'Back to the Future' easily becomes one of my
favorite movies. Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me you built
a time machine... out of a DeLorean? Even my mom remembers what the
Flux-Capacitor is! Michael J. Fox was amazing in the 80's; from Alex P.
Keaton in 'Family Ties' to Scott Howard in 'Teen Wolf', he caught the
eye of many-a-girls; including mine...still! This movie has
unforgettable characters like Doc and Biff Tannen, it still gets me on
the couch and watching it over and over. The sequels may have been
really REALLY bad, but, hey, nothing compares to the original, right?
