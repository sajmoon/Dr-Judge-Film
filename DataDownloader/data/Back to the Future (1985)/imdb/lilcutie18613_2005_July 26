This is a great movie. I like it so much. No, I don't like it, I LOVE
it. It is one of my all-time favorite movies that I could seriously
watch one hundred times in a row and not get bored of it.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown, a scientist who invents the flux
capacitor which is &quot;what makes time travel possible&quot;. When him and his
friend, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), decide to test it out on his dog,
Einstein, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955! With trying to get
his parents to fall in love and get back to his normal life to be
reunited with his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, life becomes
complicated.<br /><br />This movie is funny, intelligent, and is just a feel-good movie. Sit
down with some popcorn and enjoy!
