This one is a classic ! It's the incredible story of a teenager who must go
back in time to save is parents marriage. Highly imaginative screenplay by
Bob Gale and Robert Zemmekis. Good special effects and the good classic
character played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Loyd as the crazy
scientist. You never get tired to watch this movie again and again. A
terrific start to one of the best trilogy of all time !<br /><br />I give it ***** out of *****
