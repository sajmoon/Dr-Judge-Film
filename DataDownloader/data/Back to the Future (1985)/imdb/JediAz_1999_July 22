The Back to the Future trilogy is utterly brilliant.  The two most
important
aspects for a film, in my opinion, are plot and character- and the Back to
the Future films deliver on both!<br /><br />The plot contains fun, excitement and humor in abundance.  Time travel is
not new when it comes to story telling, but writers Gale and Zemeckis have
handled it brilliantly in these films.<br /><br />There characters in this series are fantastic!  The two leads, Doc Brown
and
Marty McFly, have a wonderful relationship throughout the trilogy, and
there
are also fun supporting characters, such as George McFly and Biff
Tannen.
Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the crazy, eccentric Doc, and Michael J.
Fox equally great as Marty McFly.
I love this trilogy dearly, and it is only surpassed by the mighty Star
Wars saga.<br /><br />
