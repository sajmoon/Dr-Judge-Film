Back to the future is probably the only time travel film that is interesting
on a scientific angle, and fun on an adventurous level. The film (like most
of the films that I like), has everything going for it. Cast, music, script,
etc. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfect for the roles of Marty
and Doc. I enjoy the fact that it explains the story in a way that for those
of us who don't read up on time travel can understand.<br /><br />  Another thing that I liked about the film was that it took place in the
50's. If it had of been me writing it, I probably wouldn't of picked this
era. But after seeing the film I probably would of reconsidered. I really
don't like the 50's; but this film made me enjoy the story regardless, which
is a powerful thing to do. 
  Back to the Future has everything for it, it attracts, and it flows with a
positive plot and feeling. Making this film near the top of my choices of
Sci-fi, and maybe perhaps over all genres.
