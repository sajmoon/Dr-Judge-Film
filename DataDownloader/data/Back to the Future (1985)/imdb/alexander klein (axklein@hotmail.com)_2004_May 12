The first time i ever saw back to the future was in a colombian
channel.......more than half of the movie was cut....and believe me, even
like this i loved it.....it's just a great film.<br /><br />when i heard of this movie for the first time of my life,i only knew it
was
a sci-fi movie.....nothing else.....i didn't know it was funny......and
trust me back to the future is fun itself.
Michael J. Fox does arguably his best performance ever and the whole cast
is
excellent.
But let me tell you one thing:if you ever see this for the first time
ever,
don't expect a usual sci-fi movie.......you just get ready to see one of
the
funniest movies of all time.
