1999_July 3 

Back To The Future is hands down my favorite movie of all time.I like the
sequels just as much but I have seen it about 80 times and every time I
see
it,it feels like a whole new experience.Awesome Soundtrack,Great Cast and
the Best writing and directing I have seen for a sci-fi comedy makes this
one a true classic.
