Back to the Future is a great movie and it is part of a great trilogy.Many
people may not like the time travel movies but I do and BTTF trilogy is the
movies for ME.I just love the fact that one of MY favorite actors
Christopher Lloyd is in all three of them and I just love the way he is in
them.And not to mention Michael J. Fox,Thomas F. Wilson and most of the
others are in the three films.<br /><br />Back to the Future part I is the one that started it all. The 80s is MY
favorite decade and this movie has such a great feeling to it. The ending is
good and I am so glad the adventure continued with two more sequels. If you
have not seen any Back to the Future film I suggest you see the first one.
BTTF is such a great movie!
