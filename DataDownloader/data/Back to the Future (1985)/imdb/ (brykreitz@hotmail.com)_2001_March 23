This is an excellent sci-fi movie and a great idea for a story.  A kid who
travels back in time and finds his way home, but it is much more than
that.
It is hilarious and just a great plot and i just love this movie.  It is
definitely in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  I could watch this
everyday if i had to.  The cast is brilliant and i cant say enough about
how
great the story is.  It is a must buy and watch all the
time.
