The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for
one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett
Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty
years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he
is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the
future, but this is the least of Marty&#39;s problem. After accidentally
getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother
and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time
forever, and destroys his own existence.<br /><br />This may not be one of the most complex time travel movie, but it is
sure a lot of fun! I love time travel movies. Everything you&#39;ve seen
from an average time travel movie is seen here: Person goes to the past
and if he changes anything, the future will change; but only this time,
there are some problems with having a mother loving her son (actually
falling in love with each other).<br /><br />Now this is one weird and wacky time travel movie. There are things
that have been done in other time travel movies before (even theories
made up by one of the characters) but there are also new and maybe not
as original (as I hoped) things in here to enjoy and mess your mind
around. But the main thing is try to not over complicate what is going
on. Just have fun.
