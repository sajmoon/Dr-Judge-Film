This is a very superior slice of sci-fi fun and one of the films that has
endeared itself to me over the years. Marty Mcfly is a great character that
you feel for and the script is humourous and fun. The main thing is Michael
J Fox is cool and will be as long as he has these films on his cv. Think
Indy without the violent historic bits and you will get a picture of this
fun 80's made adventure for all the family. I'm sure it will still entertain
in 30 years time! 9/10
