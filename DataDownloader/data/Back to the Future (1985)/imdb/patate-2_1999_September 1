Who didn't fantasize about time travel. Flicks and TV series about this
are
just as numerous as westerns. This series of three flicks does a good job.
Good questions are asked. Good solutions were found by screenwriters.
Quantum physicians would find it interesting and likely as well. Don't let
your kids grow-up without seeing it. While at it, see it with them. There
are nice cars and beautiful actress for dads as well as some moving
moments
for moms. You won't get bored.
