Being made in the in the mid 80's , when visual effects were not as fine
as
today's
this film is a piece of art
when evaluating the story flow
and the accuracy of the events sequence
it had some new ideas about time-machine
and time traveling
and I know that there are a lot of people out there who agree with
me
and share with me the love of this series
the other 2 parts also are very well done
and i think the 3 parts make a must have collection to everyone's
library
