2000_January 13 

Hey, it may not be cool to say so, but this is the greatest
movie ever made! Seeing this film in the theatres at age 13
changed the way I look at the silver screen and the way film can
effect one's life. This movie had it all and despite the passage
of 15 more years of filmgoing, criticism, film school, and the
inevitable pressures to abandon all that a youngster finds cool-
this movie is still the best
