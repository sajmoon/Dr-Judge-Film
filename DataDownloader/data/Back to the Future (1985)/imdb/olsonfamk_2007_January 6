I&#39;ve seen this movie about 100 times, and I never get tired of it. It
has great humor and a great plot line. Just the time traveling in the
movie intrigues me. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Marty Mcfly
and Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Doc Brown. There isn&#39;t a
single bad actor in the film ( well, maybe one, though I haven&#39;t looked
for him/her). The only bad thing about this film is the swearing. I
love this film, but there is just a bit too much swearing for my taste.
It wouldn&#39;t be as bad if there was only a little, but there is a TON! I
mean, come on! They&#39;re not even necessary to the film and make me
cringe every time I hear them. There are other things that they can
say. All in all, if you like movies with good actors, good humor
(mostly ) and good plot points and twists, then this is the movie for
you. I recommend the whole Trilogy! 8/10 ( -2 for swearing )
