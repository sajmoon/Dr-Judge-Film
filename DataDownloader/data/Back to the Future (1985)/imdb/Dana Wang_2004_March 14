Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is pretty much an outcast at school. His school
master doesn't like him and his rock music is not appreciated by his school,
either. What he only has is his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and his
good friend, Dr Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty comes from a
miserable family, his father George (Crispin Glover) is constantly bullied
by his superior Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the rest of his family are
just pathetic.<br /><br />This is the year of 1985. Doc asks Marty to assist him videotaping his new
invention- a time travel machine using plutonium stolen from the terrorists
whom Doc is supposed to work for. When Doc is shot, Marty gets into the time
machine and accidentally goes back to 1955.<br /><br />There he once again, by accident, interrupts the meeting of his future
parents. Now he must find Doc in order to get him back to the future and
make his teenage parents fall in love with each other, otherwise Marty won't
even exist. What he is not aware is that, by encouraging his father, George,
the latter makes a significant step to fight back Biff, who goes to the same
high school with him and who has been bullying him forever. This time, Marty
changes his future for better, which is a sweet surprise.<br /><br />Without plutonium, Doc and Marty can only rely on lightning to send Marty
back to 1985. Fortunately, Marty has got the exact information on when the
clock tower will be struck by the lightning, so he can go back to the
future. He also leaves Doc a note asking him not to open until
1985...<br /><br />This is the film which made Michael J Fox to stardom and he is dynamic.
Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the flaky Doc Brown. It must be utterly
funny to travel back in time...thirty years earlier. The film is truly
entertaining. An all time classic for sure.
