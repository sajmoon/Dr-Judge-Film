My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.<br /><br />Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all
time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE
FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining.
Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet
professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive
producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind,
and I think it&#x27;s also one of a kind.<br /><br />The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the
pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they&#x27;re still
a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real &#x22;special effect&#x22; of
the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob
Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The
entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and
brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other
time-travel films &#x27;ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally
whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling
Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played
hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble
with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother
(Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father
(Crispin Glover), which sets the film&#x27;s hilarious comedy with a
difference.<br /><br />Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect
family entertainment, and I think it still is. It&#x27;s fun and original,
something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can&#x27;t do at the
same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE
FUTURE doesn&#x27;t get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition.
The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them
as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few,
who haven&#x27;t seen it, don&#x27;t afford to miss it! <br /><br />Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.
