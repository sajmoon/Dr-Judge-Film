I haven&#x27;t seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again
after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.<br /><br />As I remembered, it&#x27;s a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never
flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I
remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the
movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch.
Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but
there&#x27;s a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of
circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but
wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been
thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time
travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to
criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic
sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.<br /><br />If you&#x27;ve never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you&#x27;ve
seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together
it is.
