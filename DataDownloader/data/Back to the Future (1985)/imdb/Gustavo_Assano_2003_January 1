<br /><br />I understood that all of the three movies must be watched as weekend
movies. So they are made just to make us have some fun while we watch It.
They took a not original idea and put it in an original story. Michael J.
Fox is in his best kind of character (teenage complicated guy) and if
you're
a Rob Zemeckis fan, you should watch it. I recommend it.
