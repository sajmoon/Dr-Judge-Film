I feel it is my personal responsibility to inform the world of this
movie&#39;s brilliance. I have been in love with this movie ever since I
was a kid and I still watch it regularly. It&#39;s such a fun story, and
the plot is more in depth than most people realize. I swear I notice
something interesting that I never noticed before every time I watch
this movie. Anytime I talk to someone who hasn&#39;t seen it, I feel
obligated to show it to them. The acting is superb; you&#39;ll fall in love
with Doc Brown&#39;s eccentricity and wish you were as cool as Marty McFly.
Overall this is a movie that will disappoint no one, regardless of your
movie tastes; it has something for everyone.
