&quot;If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.&quot; <br /><br />This is a film where anything is possible and what every single person
has once dreamt about.....embarking on time travel.<br /><br />This an enjoyable and satisfying film about a teenage boy (Marty) being
forced to go back in time using the iconic flux capacitor invented by
Emmet &quot;Doc&quot; Brown. While Marty is back in time he inavertely changes
the future which includes him never existing.<br /><br />Not only is this a nostalgic snapshot of what the 50&#39;s used to be like,
its also a vivid juxtaposition of time periods (50&#39;s and 80&#39;s). It has
clever and slick references to the differences in the 50&#39;s to the 80&#39;s
and how naive people were.<br /><br />Is this an epic masterpiece? No, but its a big achievement in cinema
because it brings a lot of peoples impossible dreams alive. This is
probably one of the greatest comedies ever and is definitely Micheal J
fox&#39;s best film so far. 9/10 A must see
