this is a very good movie. I have seen it about three times
and it still is a lot of fun to watch. The movie has a near
perfect
story with several nice little details. There is a tiny bit of questionable
logic in the story which would normally make me give
a 9 to a movie like this (you can't give a 9.9 here at the
IMDB.)
Since this movie is near perfect and still is a lot of fun after about three
times I will round a 9.9 up to a 10.
