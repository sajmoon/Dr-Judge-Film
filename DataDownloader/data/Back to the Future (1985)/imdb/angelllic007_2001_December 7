I have to say I've seen this movie a thousand times and each time its as
good as the first. Michael J. Fox is one of my favorite actors and
Christopher Lloyd is great. Its a good family movie and although it doesn't
have much of a moral (don't go back in time or you could disappear?)some
movie can be just for fun. I liked the second one best out of the three so
I
have to give it 9/10
