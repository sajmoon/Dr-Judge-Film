I can't start to tell you how awesome this movie is! Especially the
effects for its time! I just love this movie for the story.<br /><br />But, i wonder why it is rated PG? it has an unreasonable amount of
FOWL,FOWL language in it! Parents beware!: before you let your young
one's see this, you had better watch it, first! Or, you can just let
them watch the T.V. version if it! It also has ONE scene of teen
drinking and smoking!<br /><br />I wonder how they got all of that time travel stuff in the De Lorean?<br /><br />I really recommend this movie! if you are an 80's fanatic, you will
love this movie!
