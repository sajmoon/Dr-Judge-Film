The mark of a good movie is one you can watch fifteen years later and still
enjoy.  Back to the Future is such a film.  However, instead of just being
fun looking back at the 1950s, this movie is fun for looking back at the
1980s, too.  (A DeLorean?!)  Great, wholesome fun, and Christopher Lloyd
still steals the show!
