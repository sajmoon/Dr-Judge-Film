Back to the Future is a film that for people of my generation would
have growth up with, along with other important films like the original
Indiana Jones films, Stars Wars trilogy, the first two Alien films, the
Rocky Series and Mad Max 1 and 2 (just to name a few). Here is a fun
family film that has stood the test of time.<br /><br />Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), is a 17-year-old teenager living in Hill
Valley, California. He has a loving family, a good girlfriend and helps
a mad scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). But he lives in
a geeky family, his dad George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by his
supervisor and avoids confrontation, his mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson)
has conservative values and doesn&#x27;t like Marty&#x27;s relationship with
Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and Marty&#x27;s brother and sister are generally
geeky. One Dr. Brown, aka &#x27;Doc&#x27;, asks for Marty&#x27;s assistance and
records the experiments with his next invention, a time machine (in the
design of a DeLorean DMC-12). The test seems successful until Libyan
terrorists kill &#x27;Doc&#x27; and whilst on the run Marty ends up travelling
back in to 1955. Whilst in 1955 Marty meets both his mum and dad as
teenagers, and interferes with how they met. By doing this he messes up
the time-space continuum and risks his own existences. The younger
version of Lorraine falls for Marty, not know he is her future son;
adding both to comedy and general creepiness. It&#x27;s a race against time,
both to get back to 1985 and to insure destiny is fulfilled by his
setting up his parents.<br /><br />Back to the Future is a family sci-fi comedy which is a symbol of its
time. It works as a fish out of water comedy, teen comedy and a general
look at time travel. They is a simple plot and theme about Marty
finding out who his parents are and looks at the similarities and
differences of live in the 50s and 80s. The aim of the filmmakers was
to make a fun film, and Robert Zemeckis does this. He is a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; of
Steven Spielberg and he keeps the story simple and entertaining. He
also shows his skills as a special effects director which in this film
were very good. The special effects help the story, but don&#x27;t
overshadow it. They is a very good script to this film, mixing drama
and comedy, and hasn&#x27;t dated badly. The film is humorous and
light-hearted. The humour is not crude, like it it in some family
films. There is a strong story and with good messages for kids about
standing up to bullies and respecting your parents. Michael J. Fox was
perfectly casted for the lead role and there are many excellent
supporting cast members. Lea Thompson was perfectly pretty as Lorraine
and Crispin Glover was fine as a needy kid. Christopher Lloyd and
Thomas F. Wilson were really excellent as the mentor and the villain.<br /><br />Back to the Future is an influential family film. It is a mark of
pop-culture with this movie being parodied in Family Guy and Futurama.
It is Robert Zemeckis&#x27; best film (though Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a
close second).
