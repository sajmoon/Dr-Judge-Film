This movie is just a masterpiece on its own, because for two reasons. One,
it has some amazing special effects which are pretty good in the time it was
made. Also this movie is a funny sci fi which is rarely seen in any other
type of movie like this. Micheal J. Fox does a brillant job of playing,Marty
McFly and Christopher Lloyd cracks me up with his characther, Dr Emmet
Brown. This movie is good at it time and will always be remembered for
generations to come.
