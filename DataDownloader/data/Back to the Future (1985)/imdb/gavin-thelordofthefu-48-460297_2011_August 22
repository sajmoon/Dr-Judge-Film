Do you know what genre I like in movies? Why, it&#x27;s time traveling, of
course so we could learn when or not we are supposed to alternate time
which could cause a time paradox. That&#x27;s why we get Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s
Back To The Future (before he went on and directed motion capture films
like &#x22;The Polar Express&#x22;, &#x22;Beowulf&#x22;, &#x22;A Christmas Carol&#x22;, and produced
Simon Wells&#x27;s box office bomb &#x22;Mars Needs Moms&#x22;) about a teenager who
travels back 30 years in a delorean to the year 1955 where he meets his
teenager parents and must save them from an evil bully and get back to
the year 1985 with help from his scientist friend.<br /><br />Since this is one of the few movies that I gave a 100% too, it has a
few good things that got me thrilled.<br /><br />The story was well-written thanks to the writers and the producers of
this movie, the characters were likable I couldn&#x27;t even decide which
ones I like the most.<br /><br />The actors had a lot of talent. Michael J. Fox is a lot of fun. I mean,
every movie you saw that has him, &#x22;Stuart Little&#x22; and the sequel,
&#x22;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&#x22;, you name it. Christopher Lloyd was very
entertaining as Doc Brown and has been in really good movies ever
since.<br /><br />The time traveling scenes were fantastic I just loved every minute of
them and the 1985 and 1955 period settings were very realistic.<br /><br />The comedy was very hilarious as long as it got me a few laughs here
and there. Even the science about time traveling really got me
interested.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri did some very good music in this movie which makes this
movie so damn epic and the catchphrases were so cool.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Zemeckis for your successful take on science even
though it&#x27;s been 26 years since you made this masterpiece. Thumbs Up.<br /><br />10/10
