This film is an impressive creation of the incredible adventure of time
travel.  Many aspects of this film make it work, especially the talents of
the great director Robert Zemekis.  It is a movie where the new kid on the
block of the 80's truly shines with great acting.  The other main actors of
this movie, eg the Doc, Biff, George, Lorraine were an excellent cast
selection.<br /><br />The musical score for this film by John Williams is as usual, a
fantastically composed piece of musical art that fits perfectly in to Back
to The Future.  The film was excellently edited, contained phenomenal
special effects and many great moments.  In my opinion a movies main job is
to create special moments, and this one had no shortage.<br /><br />Other aspects of this film made this a success, ie the lighting, set,
acting, props(which includes the DeLorean), the several motifs that run
through the movie about 'time'(music, clocks, being late for something etc)
and many more.  The camaraderie between Marty and the Doc in 1985 and 1955
is beautifully contrasted in that they make solid friendships in both time
frames.<br /><br />The audience can tell this movie isn't meant to be a totally series film and
that it is also a comedy aswell as science fiction.  The deliberate
over-acting sometimes visible, ie when the Doc says, &quot;..Next Saturday night
were sending you back to the future!,&quot; and points straight to the camera
shows this, and is appropriate in this comedy.  Also when George says,
'..And not you or anyone on this planet is going to make me change my
mind..&quot;  This in addition to the comedy tells the audience that the film she
be taken as a light hearted sci-fi comedy.<br /><br />Robert Zemekis has shown in this film that he is indeed a prolific director.
 I look forward to writing reviews on his other successes but for y'all who
haven't seen this movie it is smash, SO SEE IT.
