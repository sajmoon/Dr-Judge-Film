The movie... well, what can I say that hasn't been said before? One of the
best Sci-Fi/comedy/adventure combinations ever, and one of the best
blockbuster spectaculars ever. But I have a complaint...<br /><br />I own the DVD, and took a look to the deleted scenes. They look awful, but
that's not my complaint. It's that there are two deleted bits that
DEFINITELY should have been in the final movie.<br /><br />One is the &quot;Doc's Personal Belongings&quot; bit. Apart from being fun (&quot;there are
no towels in the future?&quot;), it explains where the hairdryer in the &quot;Darth
Vader&quot; scene came from, so it covers a plot hole. The other one is the bit
where Marty discovers his mother cheating in an exam. This is not really
crucial for the plot, but it's very nice because in the final scene, where
Marty sees his &quot;new&quot; parents for the first time, they come into the house
after playing a tennis match or something, and Lorraine says that she wants
a rematch, to which George answers: &quot;Why? Have you cheated?&quot;. This links
beautifully with the exam thing, and incluiding it in the movie would warm
up George and Lorraine's relationship a lot, implying total
confidence.<br /><br />As for the other deleted bits, they either hurt (the &quot;Darth Vader Extended&quot;
scene is too reiterative, and the phone booth thing seems unsolved) or don't
specially enhance the film.<br /><br />After seeing the SUPERMAN and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE extended DVD
director's cuts (which greatly enhance the original cuts), I think it would
be really nice that Zemeckis went the same way with BTTF, so bettering
what's already a very good film and making it a masterpiece.<br /><br />BTW, I know there's a special extended TV cut that puts those scenes back on
place. If anyone has it, please send a private message to me, as I'm very
interested in a copy. Thanks in advance.
