<br /><br />This is my favorite movie out there when you have a chance to buy the movie
in the fall cause thats when it comes out buy it! There are a lot of ways
to
enjoy this timeless classic but the best way is to watch it on surround
sound with all the lights turned off and a bowl of popcorn it front of you!
well do me a favor please rent this movie at your local movie rental store!
