1999_April 25 

I love this movie. It's hard to believe the
first time I saw this movie was only 3 and
a half or 4 years ago. I always heard of
it, just never watched it. I saw part II
before this one in 1990. Back to the Future
kept growing on me after seeing it 3 and a
half or 4 years ago. It grew to the point
that I loved it, and I think it's one of the
best feel-good movies of all time! I give
Back to the Future ***1/2 out of ****
