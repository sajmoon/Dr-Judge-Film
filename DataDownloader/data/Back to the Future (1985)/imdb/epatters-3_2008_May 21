I am a 11 year old fan of BTTF. It is a fact that this is the best of
the series. And I agree with it. This is my 3rd favorite film ever.
Well,this is my first day of being an online critic so I felt like I
should start out with my top 10 favorite movies. Well, anyways, this is
the best time travel film ever. If you have not seen it, Buy it. Most
people have seen this but there are some people out there who have not
seen it yet. I love this film a lot because I laugh at it, I can relate
to this, and I want to be a time traveler. MPAA Rating: PG. My MPAA
Rating:PG-13. Great movie. Everyone who hasn&#x27;t seen it needs to see it
now. Someday, I have the box set. I love these movies. If you hate
them,then that is find but I will have a hard time understanding that.
This film is my Density, I mean destiny. 10 out of 10
