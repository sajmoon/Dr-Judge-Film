This is one of my favorite movies ever!!! It has so much to offer: an
innovative an d thoroughly thought through plot, the eighties, terribly
good jokes, Marty McFly, and last but not least time-traveling. I
especially love the skate-boarding scene where cool Marty McFly tries
to escape Biff and his thugs who bully George McFly who is Marty
McFly&#39;s father. It&#39;s really neat to compare the fashion styles of the
eighties, the sixties and today&#39;s fashion. As a young boy I had to see
this movie over and over. Today I can laugh about a lot of stuff I
didn&#39;t get back then. Gotta see this one. Already, an all-time
classic!! I do not give my hopes up to see a fourth part some day...
