Ooooooohhhhhh yes!!!  What a movie!  What can I say that hasn't already
been
said before?!  Not much I guess!<br /><br />A classic movie - brilliant acting, brilliant music, fantastic story and
ingeniously executed.  This film is over 15 years old and it still gives
me
a buzz when I watch it.<br /><br />In my opinion this film is still massively under-rated.  Very few films
have
intelligent plots like this.<br /><br />A deserved 10 out of 10.
