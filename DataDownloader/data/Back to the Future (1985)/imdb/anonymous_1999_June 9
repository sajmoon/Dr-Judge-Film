1999_June 9 

Back to the future has to been considered one of the greatest films of all
time.  There is no other movie that can match its entertainment value,
isn't
that why we see movies in the first place?  It is that simple.  The movie
keeps you in suspense from the moment it begins to the very end.  The
characters are creative and amazing.  The chemistry between Marty and Doc
is
both funny and eery, probably the best duo in film history.  It appeals to
both young and old as well.
