Marty McFly&#x27;s first ride is still every bit as charming and
entertaining as ever, although the soundtrack seems to get more dated
every time I hear it - I caught no less than five different instances
of &#x22;Power of Love&#x22; in the first ten minutes of screen time. Despite the
inherent plot issues involved with any time travel film, this is still
a great adventure with a diverse, likable cast and career-defining
performances from Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox and Crispin Glover.
Even though I could recite several lines verbatim from the dark
recesses of my memory, I still caught myself laughing at the jokes like
they were brand new, and grinning like a fool from start to finish.
Like many high profile BR discs, the picture on this was almost *too*
stunning - you can actually see some of the &#x22;old person&#x22; makeup flaking
off around certain characters&#x27; necks in the &#x27;80s scenes. A few early
moments are excessively grainy, but once the plot gets moving, that
clears up for good.
