The idea that a movie could possess all of the elements that allows the mind
flow freely and just sit back and relax while watching the film is
incredible to me.<br /><br />The &quot;Back To The Future&quot; trilogy has these elements and more. I can't
believe how well put together this film was from start to finish. This is a
feel good movie for movie lovers who just want to clear their
minds.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were well selected to play Marty and
&quot;Doc.&quot; They pulled it off with ease and conviction that I still look at them
as though they were still Marty and &quot;Doc&quot; when performing in other movies
and television shows. When a movie does this, I think it shows that it
accomplished what it set out to do and that was produce a great
film.<br /><br />In addition, &quot;Back To The Future&quot; brought back a lot of good memories and
reminded me why I chose to see the first many years ago. This is certainly
on my top ten favorite movie list of all time. I'm proud to say this is and
will always be a favorite of mine.
