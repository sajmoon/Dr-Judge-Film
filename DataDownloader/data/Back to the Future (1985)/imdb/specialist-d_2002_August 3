Back to the Future...I remember going to see it with my buddy and his Dad
in
1985. I thought that was the coolest movie ever. Over the years it has been
on countless times late at night, and still, I sit there and watch it
again.
I might know the next scene or line that is coming up, but I'm laughing
anyway. This film shows best friends, love interests, rock-n-roll, and a
time travelling Delorean. It also touches on the ethics of scientific
progress, If we could travel through time, what would be the consequences
of
our actions? I recommend this film to anyone that would just like to have a
fun time watching a movie, just don't try to ruin the fun by overanalyzing
the facts. (We all know that Back to the Future 3 would have lasted only 10
minutes had they used logic)
