Fans of scifi and comedy will love this movie. Here you have a young
slacker named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who meets this crackpot
scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who builds a time machine
out of a DeLorean: America's Flop Car that'll remain memorable in this
movie. Spoofed off H.G. Wells &quot;Time Machine&quot; &quot;BTTF&quot; is memorable all
the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past
is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he
meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty
knew his father was a &quot;peeping tom&quot; when he was younger. Then trying to
make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and
his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything
was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he
introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed
completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown
is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid
cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks! I thought is was
great, my mother digs Michael J. Fox! 5 stars!
