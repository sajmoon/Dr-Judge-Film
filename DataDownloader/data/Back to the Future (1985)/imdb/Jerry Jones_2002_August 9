*** 1/2<br /><br />Starring: Michael J. fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin
Glover.<br /><br />Don't be mislead by the title, they don't actually go back to the 'future'. 
They go back to the past, and then back to the present.  It's not until the
sequel do they go to the future.  Then the next sequel they go back to the
past.  But I'm getting way ahead of myself.  Michael J. fox stars as any
everyday 80s teenager.  Girls and rock'n roll was on his mind.  Until his
scientist friend Doc creates a time machine out of a DeLorean.  He sends
Marty back to 1955, which is a big problem.  He meets his future mother and
his future is in danger.  The movie is a highly entertaining, feel-good
comedy with great acting and directing.  The movie is very smart and
intelligent, where many eighties movies fail at.  You should definitely see
this movie, and if so see the other two.
