If this film were first released today, it would probably be ranked #1 on
this sites top 250 list.  But, the flavor of the day is Lord of the Rings. 
Unfortunate.<br /><br />This film captures everything I love about the movies.  From perfectly
structured writing, vivid often hilarious characters, a majestic score, 
twists, turns, and an out and out creative concept.  And in the words of
writer/director Robert Zemeckis, perhaps the one pure gem he had in him as a
writer.<br /><br />It's only down side is occasionally less than stellar acting (Claudia Wells)
and less that stellar audio looping.  But, the great far outweighs the bad. 
Recommended to anyone and everyone. 10 out of 10.  <br /><br />Ignore the sequels...  Entertaining, but not at the same
level.
