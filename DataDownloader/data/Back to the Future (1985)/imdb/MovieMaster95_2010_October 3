One evening, during my early teen years, I turned on the TV and watched
the 1985 classic &#x27;Back to the Future&#x27;, and my only regret is that I
hadn&#x27;t seen it earlier...<br /><br />The film tells the story of a skateboarding, guitar playing teenager
named Marty McFly (played by Michael J Fox) whose life is far from
perfect. That is until his eccentric, scientist friend Doc Brown
(played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine and sends him back
to 1955. From there the movie really accelerates into exhilarating fun
that get more complicated as it goes on but will keep you entertained
until the very end.<br /><br />Pretty much everything about &#x27;Back to the Future&#x27; works from the
interesting characters, to the clever humour, to the magical experience
of going back in time. But without giving too much away, I&#x27;m going to
let you go see it for yourself. A well worth purchase and a classic for
generations to come.
