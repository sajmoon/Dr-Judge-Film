Classic. A bundle of laughs that manages to incorporate sci-fi, fantasy
and adventure, without tripping up on itself. You could watch it on
repeat for ages, and the jokes and quips never get old. Michael J. Fox
is perfect as Marty McFly, capturing that ultimate boyish charm that
added to the film in so many ways you can imagine. Not to mention the
DeLorean, a perfect way to time travel in style, and Christopher Lloyd
as the craziest Doc Brown possible. It could not be entirely possible
that this movie can and will be beaten. You don&#x27;t have to be a geek to
like this, as there is so much to like about it. I am certain that this
will never be forgotten for at least forever as it is such a brilliant
movie.
