One of the best thing i like about BTTF is that, the concept and
visualization of travel travel presented is so realistic and unique it
really makes me believe its actually real. Like most of the other movies
which show time travel they don't have much of a sense to a common person.
Not to mention great plot and performances in the movie. Also i love the
sound track of BTTF, one of the best soundtrack of any movie I have heard.
Huey Lewis &amp; The News rock! I give it 10/10. Ciao!
