Time travel is a difficult subject, but it&#39;s still used often in
movies. Usually there&#39;s major plot holes, and there&#39;s some in this film
too. But this is such a well-made movie that it&#39;s easy to forget the
oddities in plot and just have a fun time. The character&#39;s in this
movie are maybe it&#39;s major weakness, they are very one dimensional. But
some characters, like Doc and Michael J. Fox&#39;s character Marty, are so
good that it overcomes the weaknesses.<br /><br />The film was continued with two sequels, neither of which are as good
as the first, but they&#39;re not bad either. As a kid, I was much more
interested in the future than the past that this first film deals with,
and thought the second film was better. But now looking at them
objectively, it&#39;s clear that this first film is the best. Overall it&#39;s
a very enjoyable trilogy.
