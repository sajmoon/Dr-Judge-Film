Back to the Future is one of the greatest adventure movies ever! The
story follows Marty McFly, a normal teen from 1985 who visits his
friend Doc Brown one day to discover that he has invented a time
machine. Then, the Doc explains that the fuel for it is plutonium,
which he stole from terrorists. That night, terrorists come and shoot
down Doc Brown, and chase Marty until he accidentally goes back in time
to the 1950s, where he must make his parents fall in love, and get Doc
Brown to help him get back to the future, along with telling Doc Brown
about his death to save him. A great fun movie.<br /><br />Grade: 9/10<br /><br />MPAA Rating: PG<br /><br />My Rating: Ages 9 and up (adult situations, language, violence)
