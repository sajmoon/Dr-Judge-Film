this is my alltime favourite film!!!the incredible story of typical
teenager
marty who accidentally travels back in time to the fifties.the story is so
full that there is never a dull moment and so clever that tiny things that
you wouldnt think are important turn out to have major implications to the
plot of the story!<br /><br />Michael J Fox gives an amazing performance as marty mcfly and you really
do
fall in love with his character.i love the way that the plot is so clever
when it puts in little bits of information that turn up later in the
film.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to everyone because it is soooooo brilliant
that
youd be mad not to like it!!!<br /><br />11/10
