Today isn&#x27;t the anniversary of the release of this movie (that was back
in July) but today is the twenty-sixth anniversary of the day Marty
McFly went back time in it which makes it the same number anniversary
as this date! So keep in mind all the glory and powerful image this
story has evoked for everyone over the years since 1985 and the further
impact it will have for generations to come. You know I&#x27;m a child of
the 1980&#x27;s and think that this was an awesome decade in which to grow
up. While of course every time period has it&#x27;s ways for being defined
this way I hope that all you out there will take a chance to view the
particular attributes the 1980&#x27;s had for shaping society and try to
notice the positive impact and images you can make out of them. I mean
it took things like friendship, love, warm feeling, innocence, and even
comic relief and mysticism very profoundly and emphasized that anything
can have some form of bright side, and that every possibility is
endless! These movies with a new generation in special effects (which
was as I&#x27;ve heard launched by Star Wars in 1977) began about 1980, or
to a more exact point 1982 with the theater release of E.T. (the first
movie I saw on the big screen) and continued for the rest of the decade
which went well given that it was just in time for the positive image
as described above. One thing I know is that for the rest of my life
I&#x27;ll be in the process of keeping this era alive as much as I can, and
showing the world what an extraordinary icon every member of society
can make of themselves and the world around them. Transcendence is the
key as outlined in these many incredible pictures and pop culture icons
(and countless other forms) of the 1980&#x27;s to making the world a better
place and the limitless potential that everyone and everything
possesses shine!
