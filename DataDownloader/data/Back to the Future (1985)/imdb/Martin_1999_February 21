I think that the Back to the future Trilogy is the best of all movie
trilogies I 've seen. Last year I bought the video Trilogy and this year I
bought the Soundtrack Cd.
I hope that some day the Back to the Future N&ordm;4 movie will  appear. I think
that it will have a lot of success.
I think that the first one is the best of all but I also like the second one
and the third one!!!
