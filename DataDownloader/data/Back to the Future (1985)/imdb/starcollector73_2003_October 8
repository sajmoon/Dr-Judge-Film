Back to the Future is one of my all time favourite movies. A perfect blend
of adventure, time travel and comedy that has the added bonus of a
sparkling
cast and a great 1950's backdrop.
Christopher Lloyd is excellent as the wide eyed, white haired Doc Brown
and
Crispin Glover delivers a memorable performance as Marty McFly's nerdish
father. This film made Michael J Fox a movie star and watching his
energetic
and adorable performance its easy to see why. Fox gives Marty charm and he
has the rare and under appreciated gift of making characters seem
likeable,
this role fits him like a glove.
Pratically rushed out to buy the trilogy on DVD when it was released and i
know its a film that i will never tire of watching.
Great soundtrack, great cast, great script, great movie...makes you
realise
how cool the 80's actually were.
