Much has been written about his hugely entertaining film. I just want
to emphasis a few points: -The script is one of the best I&#39;ve ever
seen. Four, count them, FOUR climaxes! The pacing of the film is so
delicately balanced, the last 30 minutes will leave you breathless.
Humor, action, romance, it&#39;s all there. A really well written script.<br /><br />-A GREAT and under-rated score. Just try to get the &quot;Back to the
Future&quot; theme out of your head after a viewing. Throw in a couple of
Huey Lewis songs which perfectly fit the film&#39;s mid-80&#39;s roots, AND
MJF&#39;s rendition of &quot;Johnny B Goode&quot;, and you&#39;ve got a soundtrack worth
purchasing.<br /><br />-Hard to believe this movie is 26 years old. I just bought it and it
has aged extremely well.<br /><br />A valuable addition to anyone&#39;s DVD library.
