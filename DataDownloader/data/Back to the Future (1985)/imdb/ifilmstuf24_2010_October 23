I just got back from a 25th Anniversary Screening of &#x22;Back to the
Future&#x22; at The Puente Hills Mall. Which is the same Mall that was used
for the film. It&#x27;s like stepping into a time machine and going Back to
the Past.<br /><br />As a child I used to watch The BTTF Trilogy all the time on video. My
favorite ride at Universal Studios was the BTTF ride. And I got really
excited when the Trilogy was released to DVD.<br /><br />Now as a teenager, I got extremely excited when I read that there was
going to be a Re-Release. The showing was awesome, there were so many
other fans, there was clapping during just about every scene.<br /><br />Now for the film. The film follows a really simple plot (which is rare
for most time travel adventures). The jokes seem new every time I watch
the film. They&#x27;re always hilarious. And I have to credit the Amazing
Cast and Writers for that.<br /><br />For a Comedy, the movie packs a lot of suspense, the climax is
beautifully put together with its race against time situation.<br /><br />And what else can I say that hasn&#x27;t already been said? The movie is one
that every person in the world should see. It&#x27;s really one of the Best
Movies of All-Time 10*** out of 10***
