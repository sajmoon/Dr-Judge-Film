Back to the Future is one of the best movie of all time, not just the best
80's movie or best Sci-Fi. Back to the Future is legendary, Robert Zemeckis
can't receive enough praise for this film. Back to the Future's cast is
excellent can't say enough about the great job they did casting, Marty
(Michael J. Fox) to Principal Stickland (James Tolkan) every character is
great. I never get tired of this movie, I enjoy it just if I haven't seen it
in years. I know almost everyone has seen this classic if you haven't shame
on you.
