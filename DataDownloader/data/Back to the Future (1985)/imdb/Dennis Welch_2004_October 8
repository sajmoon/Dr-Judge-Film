I think this movie is one of the most intelligent movies ever made!
Charmingly witty and extremely well done. I think it is downright
hilarious how Michael J. Fox's characters own mother was trying to get
in his pants and how he learned so many &quot;interesting&quot; things about his
mothers past! Another great part was when he met his jailbird uncle
when his uncle was just a baby and he told him to get used to the bars
of his crib! There were so many things that happened in one part of the
movie that became important later on in the movie that, if you weren't
paying attention, was probably lost on some people, I felt it was
brilliant! The soundtrack was also fantastic and helped set the mood
for the whole movie. The whole &quot;butterfly effect&quot; of dealing with Biff
was brilliant as well. BRAVO!
