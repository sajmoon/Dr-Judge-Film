This film has a pace &amp; magnificence which transcends major holes in the
plot/ script. Michael J Fox &amp; Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their
careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels
proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role
in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is
not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using
stock footage of him in the sequels &amp; won the suit, but he&#39;d have been
better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in
danger of being referred to as Crispin who? <br /><br />I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly
impossible to write a time travel film &amp; get it right but you love the
main characters &amp; the music so much that you don&#39;t care but some
obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950&#39;s Cafe
with 1980&#39;s money. The license plate coming off the car when they
transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. <br /><br />The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would
only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time
continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like
how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950&#39;s to &quot;who the hell is John F
Kenedy?&quot; to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the
Fox - Llloyd quotes:<br /><br />&quot;You built a time machine out of a Deloran?&quot; &quot;The way I see it, if your
going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!&quot;<br /><br />The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox &amp; Christopher Lloyd
who is really over the top. Put your brain away, &amp; get on into the DMC
time machine. Enjoy it!
