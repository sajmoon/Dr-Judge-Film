1st watched 5/5/2002 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Robert Zemeckis):
Silly and corny, but likeable and sometimes funny time travel comedy.  A
major hit when it first came out which I think had more to do with how well
it was marketed then how good of a movie it was.  Michael J. Fox carries
the
film with his charm and his ability to do physical comedy.  The story jumps
back and forth from serious to silly which keeps us giggling and the good
guys win in the end which usually makes for a winner at the box office.
The
focus of most of the comedy has to do with Michael trying to get his
parents
together despite his unexpected intervention into their lives and being his
mom's flame for awhile putting a damper on his real mom and dad getting
together.  It all works out in the end of course and we're ready for part
ii
in the series which is predicted by the &quot;To be continued...&quot; as the credits
roll.
