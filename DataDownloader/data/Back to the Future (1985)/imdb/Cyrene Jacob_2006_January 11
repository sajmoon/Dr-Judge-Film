The first time I saw this movie, I was like screaming with joy!! I had
never seen a more enjoyable and witty movie in my life till then. About
the time I was a teenager, thinking about what I would not do to go
back in time and change things in the past!!! The 'time travel' trilogy
is, I think the best that is, though not scientifically accurate.
Robert Zemickis' shots of the DeLorean were amazing and well cut
(though somebody reported seeing black gloves on some remote-controlled
shots of the DeLorean! - frankly I could not make out the gloves. OK,
maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly
and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I
think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a
teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most
memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was
impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of
Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by
Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy
'dad'. Doc's 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything!'
has got to be one of Hollywood's most positive dialogs. This is one
movie that will always be one my favorites.
