It has everything. Adventure, excitement, 
romance, sci-fi and comedy. 
It's almost flawless in design; Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale worked hard on
the tight continuity in the Back To the Future trilogy. Making sure there
weren't any goofs in the plot. 
They researched almost everything scientifically, except the correct
pronounciation of gigawatt ;) 
This is a great family movie. 
And my favorite of all time<br /><br />
