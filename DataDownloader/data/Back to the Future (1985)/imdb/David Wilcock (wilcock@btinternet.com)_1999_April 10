Inventive, powerful, and wildly good fun, Back to the Future (BTTF) is an
amazing film. Pulling off fun jokes and exciting set pieces with ease, BTTF
follows the adventures of Marty McFly, as he travels back in time to 1955 to
try and get his parents to fall in love. Christopher Lloyd is suitable manic
as the off centre Doc Brown, the inventor of the sleek time machine, and
Crispin Glover is an absolute standout as the nerdy George McFly. Lea
Thompson is memorable as Marty's mom who falls in love with Marty in 1955
(leading to some great gags) and writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ensure
the film goes at full speed, and Huey Lewis provides a great anthem in the
form of 'The Power of Love.' The sequels never matched the whimsy on display
here, and for anyone who enjoys rollicking sci-fi, BTTF is the ultimate good
time.
