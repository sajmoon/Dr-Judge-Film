You know, while watching IMDb top 250 I found out that only this first
part is there. On 125th place. When some new &quot;trash&quot; like Sin City or
Incredables taking higher positions. I can&#39;t believe that people
forgotten that time must show the real worthness of movie. Can&#39;t you
see that Lord of the Rings doesn&#39;t deserve it&#39;s 3rd place? It&#39;s a
good-looking movie, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s not great, nor it has a smart idea
or deep plot. Just a high quality picture that&#39;s all. I regularly spend
6 hours at summers to watch the whole Back to the Future trilogy from
start to the end. I know this movie word to word and still I never get
bored of it. I simply can&#39;t understand masses - this great classic must
take something like 15th place, not lower. For me it is sad to see that
people don&#39;t understand this...
