If there are explanations to like time travels, BTTF is one of them. Robert
Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Steven Spielberg bring us with the best movie about
time travel (any doubt?) of all time. <br /><br />The cast are very competent, specially Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown) and
Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen),who make yours characters
unforgettable!!!<br /><br />The story and plot are very intelligent ...the scene of Clock Tower is one
of most memorable of the movies history!<br /><br />If you like time travel, no rent this movie...please...buy
it!!
