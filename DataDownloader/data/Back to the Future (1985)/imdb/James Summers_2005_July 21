wow. how do i put my opinions of this film into words. it is my
favourite movie purely cos its fun, entertaining, understandable but
with a bit of a mind tester the first time u see the trilogy but it has
the certain spark many other movies don't. michael j fox became my fav
actor after this movie. even tho i was only 8 when i first saw it. its
the only movie that i can watch over and over again without getting
bored. this is a timeless classic with comedy, science fiction, action,
special effects and adventure all packed into one. this is an almost
perfect movie even tho i cant see what could be improved. but nothing
is perfect is it. this is very close. I'm pretty sure everyone has seen
it but if not. get out there and watch this. it will blow u away. it is
absolutely outstanding cinema
