I thought that this film an the follow up two were excellent. Michael j
fox and Christopher Lloyd were a brilliant comedic team. And if the
rumors are true I cant wait to see if Michael follows up with a 4th
movie. go Michael. If every body watched closely in the second they
would of all seen the beginning talents of little Elijah woods. Go
Frodo.... So I recommend if every body loves little Michael J then
definitely go an rent out this box set or better yet go buy it you wont
be disappointed. I definitely wasn't. Thank you Robert Zemeckis for
bringing us these truly wonderful films, I always wished that I could
sit beside the doc an fly off in the DeLorean.
