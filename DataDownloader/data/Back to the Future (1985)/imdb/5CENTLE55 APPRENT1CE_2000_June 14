What else can I say?  This movie is CLASSIC!  It has everything!
Comedy, Sci Fi, Action, Adventure.  All the genre's mixed in one.  What I
love the most about this film is the script and how everything flows so
well.  Writing a story about time travel is very difficult and many
writers
usually end up failing.  But that is not the case with Back to the Future.
The story is believable, funny, adventurous and exciting.  Michael J. Fox,
Christopher Lloyd and Thomas Wilson are outstanding in this film and I
cannot picture any other actor playing their roles.  Again, this movie is
an
absolute classic.  I can watch this movie over and over again and I will
never get bored.  Also watch Part II and III because the Back to the
Future
Trilogy was intended to be one LONG film!  The sequels are just as good as
the original.
