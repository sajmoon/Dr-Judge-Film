1998_October 24 

This is a highly recommended movie.
It's funny, it's intersting, it really gets
you thinking and most important of all;
you don't have to be a sci-fi-fan to like it.
I think it's great, because of the humor, that
they put into it. They sort of makes jokes about
other sci-fi movies in such a good way, that
it gets interesting. The effects in the movie are
also very good. Thrust me they won't let you down.
One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.<br /><br />JAH
