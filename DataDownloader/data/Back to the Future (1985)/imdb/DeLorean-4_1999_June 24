1999_June 24 

Back to the future is probably one of the most ingenious films ever to
come
out of the 80s. The originality of the script straps you in for the ride
of
your life, we as an audience are thrust into the life of Marty McFly and
we
actually believe that we could travel through time in a DeLorean no matter
what the circumstances. Back to the future is one of the best films ever
produced easily **** four stars
