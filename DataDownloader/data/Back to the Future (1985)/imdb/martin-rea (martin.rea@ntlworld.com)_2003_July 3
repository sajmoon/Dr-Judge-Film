This is, without a doubt, a classic movie from he the 20th century and
will
continue on as a classic through the 21st century. This movie is TOP-NOTCH
stuff, filled with chuckles, humerous moments, great acting and a terrific
story-line. This movie will remain a classic for generations to come and
it
is all thanks to Robert Zemeckis, Steven Speilberg and most of all Michael
J. Fox for his sensational role as Marty Mc Fly. Lets raise a toast for
all
three of those legends of our time: to Robert, Steven and Michael, thanks
for bringing us &quot;Back To The Future.&quot; As you all agree This movie deserves
a
10/10, *****, two thumbs up. If you don't agree then you are a crackpot
and
possibly unstable.
