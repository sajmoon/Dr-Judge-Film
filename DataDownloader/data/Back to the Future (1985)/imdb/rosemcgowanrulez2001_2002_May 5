BTTF has got to be one of the best comedy movies to come out of the 80's.
Let alone it is no doubt a classic among us who grew up in the 80's. Michael
J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd have such chemistry together on screen unlike
what we see today in movies with co-stars.
Michael J. Fox is without question one of the funniest actors around. He is
not a comedian turned actor, just a talented funny actor.<br /><br />BTTF came out during Michael J. Fox's successful run on Family Ties. He was
a household name that brought us all to the theatre to see this
gem.
Robert Zemekis casts a terrific cast here. Lea Thopson (Caroline In The
City), Crispin Glover (who co-starred with Fox in the TV Movie High School
USA) to name a couple. I never found a boring part in this movie, from
beginning to end it just keeps you entertained. I can't see why/if anyone
would knock this movie as it just has so much going for it no matter what.
Too bad no other comedy movies have been done as good as this one. But like
always there will be one movie that will stand out in certain genres and
this definitely does in the comedy genre. Fox has done a string of funny
movies in the 80's and I think people should rent/buy his films to see that
he is no matter what a true talent in Hollywood. A Canadian Boy who makes us
Canadians so proud.
