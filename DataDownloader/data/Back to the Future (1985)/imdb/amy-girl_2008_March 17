I first saw &#39;back to the future&#39; with my dad when I was about seven
years old. Now over eight years later I have seen the film hundreds of
times and it is still one of my favourite movies.<br /><br />The film tells a simple story of teenager Marty (perfectly acted by
Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back thirty years in time to
when his parents were teenagers. His only hope of returning to his life
in 1985 is his scientist friend &#39;Doc&#39; Brown (also perfectly acted by
Christopher Lloyd). In the meantime his teenage mother has formed a
crush on him after he saved his father and again accidentally ruining
what should have been the start of their relationship.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t yet seen this movie &#39;WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???&#39; The
acting and casting is perfect, the directing, the special effects,
absolutely everything in this movie is perfect. One of the funniest,
most watchable movies ever created.<br /><br />10/10
