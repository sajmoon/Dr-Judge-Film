They don&#39;t make &#39;em like this anymore. Back to the Future is a
brilliant film!<br /><br />This is a brilliant, politically incorrect teen comedy, written with
blazing originality and off- beat irreverence.<br /><br />Told in a stylistically slick narrative that surprises and enlightens,
with characters that are portrayed with staggering comedic timing and
sometimes shocking depth. This will remain the pinnacle of Robert
Zemickis&#39; career. Though considered such an &#39;80s classic, the movie is
extremely timeless.<br /><br />Students today will find much to identify with in the always-fresh and
touching &quot;unknown future&quot; themes. But the most identifiable element in
the film is the farcically bureaucratic characters. In other words,
there will always be McFly roaming the hallways in this modern
environment. And as long as it stays that way, Back to the Future will
remain one of the most entertaining, satirical, and accessible comedies
around. 10/10
