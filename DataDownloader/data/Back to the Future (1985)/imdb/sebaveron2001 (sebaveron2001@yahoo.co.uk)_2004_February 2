May I start by saying even if it's not &quot;cool&quot; to like &quot;Back To The Future&quot;
it is undoubtedly a classic for all ages, from the opening sequence of marty
going into 1955 you know this is going to be class entertainment from start
to finish, not one bad moment and hey &quot;Fox&quot; looks 17!
