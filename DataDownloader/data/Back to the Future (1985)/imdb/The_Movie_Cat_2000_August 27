2000_August 27 

I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running
times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots,
patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a
genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the
occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future &#150; a family film with
daring themes of incest and attempted rape &#150; is one of
them.<br /><br />Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone
as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it
was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as
skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be
when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?<br /><br />Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding,
this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and
plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin
Glover as Marty's dad. A number of &quot;blink and you'll miss it&quot; pieces add to
the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks
up &#150; which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame &#150; proclaiming: &quot;You'll
be noticed driving the car of the future&quot;.<br /><br />Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in it's
approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we
never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake
camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher
Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild
product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of
50's Middle America is quite charming.<br /><br />Maybe there's the nagging feeling that &#150; now fifteen years old &#150; the film's
cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant
references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as
fresh or relevant as they once did. <br /><br />Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But it's lack
of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an
entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more. 6/10.
