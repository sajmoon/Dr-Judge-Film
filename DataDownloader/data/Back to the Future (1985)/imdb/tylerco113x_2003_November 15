Here starts the first of my three reviews to the BTTF series.  In this
adventure we meet Doc and Marty, along with a host of other lovable (and
hatable) characters.  Marty's life seems to suck.  His ma's an alcoholic
and
his dads a complete loser working for the all-grown-up high school bully
Biff.  He only survives because of his girlfriend Jennifer and his
friendship with Doc.  But when Marty finds out that Doc has stolen some
Plutonium to make the worlds first time machine, Marty goes through a
crazy
adventure into the 1950's and back to the future.  In this Marty will
deal
with Biff, make his parents fall in love, and change history.<br /><br />This film is very funny.  From the witty Doc Brown to the nerdy George
McFly, characters make you laugh.  But the fun of the film is seeing
Marty
encounter his parents and try to survive as an 80s kid in the 1950's.
The
acting is terrific, especially the bully Biff.  Although this movie was
not
the best in the world, it still works, and is by far the best in the
trilogy.
