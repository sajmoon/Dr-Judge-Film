Time travel is something we all want to do one day.  Still, until that day
arrives, we have Back to the Future to reminiscent off of.  Back to the
Future was a great movie.  The teen style McFly mixed with a doc inventing
everything from anything.  Going into the past was so cool.  Everyone wishes
they could visit their heritage, so this movie did it for us.  Robert
Zemeckis did a wonderful job on this flick.  My only con, is that they
didn't explore more avenues.  For example, jumping into the Roman times, or
even the Egyptian times.  Although, to be fair, they didn't actually get the
chance according to the storyline, so it's really nobody's fault.  I gave
this movie a rating of 9/10.
