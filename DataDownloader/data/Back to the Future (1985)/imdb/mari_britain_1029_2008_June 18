This movie is one of my favorite movies all time!! When I was 7 years
old, I watched this amazing movie for the first time and since then
I&#39;ve watched it more than 10 times!! However I haven&#39;t lost interest in
this movie. I continue to be fun of &quot;Back to the future&quot; forever!! In
1985, Marty McFly (Michel J. fox) is a 17-year-old living in Hill
Valley, California and his eccentric friend, scientist Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot;
Brown (Christopher Loyd) who invents a time-machine, DeLorean are
heroes of this story. One night, the terrorists find doc, and kill him
because he steals plutonium for fuel of DeLorean. Accidentally Marty
gets sent back to 1955, when Marty&#39;s parents are in their teens. At
first, Marty finds a younger Doc who helps him to try and makes his
parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won&#39;t be born. In
the end, they try to go back to 1985, the year he is originally
from....<br /><br />I&#39;d like to recommend this movie to you, because I think this movie is
the best in sci fi movies!!! It&#39;s a heart-warming movie and a touching
movie, so if you watch it, you may feel happy!! Why I love this movie
is that the plot (the story) is perfect!!!! The time-machine existing
in 1985 is unrealistic, however you will be absorbed in this story,
because there are a lot of thrilling scenes in this film. Therefore you
can&#39;t take your eyes off to the end!! I also like the soundtrack, maybe
everybody has heard it!! When I listen to this movie&#39;s soundtrack, I
feel lighter at heart!!
