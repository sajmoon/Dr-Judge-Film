I love sci-fi that is based in reality. By that I mean that you can
test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up
from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere.
Sometimes it&#39;s forgivable, sometimes it&#39;s not. But Back to the Future
(and its sequels) is as close as I&#39;ve seen to the perfect logic in a
time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all
aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to
use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the
story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie
and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.<br /><br />This movie and its sequels remains to this day my absolutely favorite
movie(s) of all time. All other time travel movies pale in comparison.
