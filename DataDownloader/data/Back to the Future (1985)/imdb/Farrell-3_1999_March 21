1999_March 21 

This is one of the few movies out there, that can be watched time and time
again, and still thrill you like it did the first time you saw it.  Back to
the Future is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy films ever made.  From the
opening pan of the clocks, to the spectacular (even today) flying Delorean
shot, this film is extremely involving and exciting. The script (even though
dated by it's 80's dialog) is fantastic.  That, along with  Zemeckis'
incredible, flawless direction (his best to date) keeps the film moving at a
smooth and satisfying pace.  This ranks right up there with Star Wars as the
best sci-fi experience ever.
