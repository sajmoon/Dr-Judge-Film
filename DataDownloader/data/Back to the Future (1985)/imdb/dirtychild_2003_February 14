Back to the Future is a great 80's movie.  It basically involves a teenager
from 1985 going back in time to 1955 &#150; he hooks up with his parents and has
to make them fall in love so the future is relatively unchanged.<br /><br />It's a film for all ages (puke!) &#150; but it is!  Middle aged people can get
their kicks out of it &#150; as a nostalgic trip back in time whereas younger
people can relate to Marty as being a fish out of water &#150; in a time where he
is unfamiliar with customs / culture.  Plus on revisiting the film recently
&#150; I picked up on the rather `incestuous' interplay with Marty (the teenager)
and his mother &#150; it puts a funny adult spin on things!<br /><br />Plus this movie has things in it for most people &#150; it has rather exciting
action sequences, it has bad 80's music (Hewy Lewis and the News alert!), it
has romance, it has comedy, it has drama, it even has Michael J
Fox!<br /><br />Go see it &#150; 9 out of 10.
