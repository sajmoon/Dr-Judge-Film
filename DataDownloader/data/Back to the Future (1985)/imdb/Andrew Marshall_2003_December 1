This is a classic film series and the first sees Marty going back to 1955 in
Doc Brown's time machine. Back in 1955
	  he searches out the 1955 version of the Doc to help get him back to 1985.
During the process, he interferes with his mother
	  and fathers 1st date and threatens his own existance. The good thing
about this film is that you really want the goodies to
come
	  out on top against the baddies. Biff gets everything he
deserves.
