BTTF trilogy is a timeless movie series. This is nothing new everyone
knows this. It is 1 of 2 movie series I can watch and rewatch and find
it a complete almost flawless piece of storytelling - the other being
Lord Of The Rings.<br /><br />That being said I would like to see the effects digitized in BTTF.
Digital effects are infinitely better than analog ones - and the
addition of such in BTTF would only further render timeless these
films. I am a bit discouraged that Zemeckis hasn&#39;t done such already. I
would want my pieces of art to be state-of-the-art and maintained
forever onwards. George Lucas knows this and I respect him
proportionately for such (though I think Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars need
a lot of work).<br /><br />Anyway, back to BTTF. Watch it and enjoy it. Hopefully we&#39;ll get
another trilogy soon of BTTF. Maybe yes, maybe no. They&#39;ll still be
great classics regardless. The only regret is that Crispin Glover out
of his arrogance and naivete didn&#39;t stick around for all 3.
