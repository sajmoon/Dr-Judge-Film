In my opinion, Back to the Future, along with its sequels, are the
single most entertaining movies ever made. There are tons of gripping
movies out there, but Back to the Future is a quality fun and edge of
your seat film...totally deserving of its place on the Top 250. The
flow of the movie, the characters who make it - everything is just
awesome. The lines...&quot;1.21 gigawatts!&quot; or anything about the Flux
Capacitor never fails to make me smile.<br /><br />One of the best things about Back to the Future is that it doesn&#39;t try
to be anything special. The movie was made by individuals who just
wanted to give the public something to enjoy...and it was a hit and
still remains one of my favorites today.
