Back to the Future is one of the time travel movies that does things
right. The story of the film is basically Marty Mcfly(played by Michael
J.Fox) is living in 1985 and his friend Doc Brown(played by Christopher
Lloyd) ,who is a mad scientist shows off his new invention: the time
machine. Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955
in Doc&#x27;s time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse,
the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his
future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and
Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his
present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I
will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent
piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all
fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie: Biff. He is a
mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in
this movie!&#x22;Well look at what we have here.&#x22; Robert Zemeckis did a
superb job in establishing the characters and the plot-line.Not to
mention, its a blend of other genres besides time-travel. There is
romance, high school, sci-fi and action all in one movie!WOW! Hoow did
they manage to do that you may ask? Well, it just works because the
script cleverly sets the movie up. Plus, the story runs very smoothly
during transitions of scenes. Usually, when time travel is involved as
a premise to a story, it would fall completely apart. But, thankfully
they didn&#x27;t do that! The story is actually not as complicated as people
think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in
the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes. Plus, the
special effects were jaw-dropping back in the 80&#x27;s but today it kind of
looks outdated. However, this film has a charm that makes this film a
spectacle in the time-travel genre. Now, what I liked about this film
was the way the story was presented and the hilarious interactions
between the characters:&#x22;Oh what are you looking at butt head?&#x22; Oh and
the special effects! &#x22;If my calculations are correct, when this baby
hits 88 mph, you&#x27;re gonna see some serious s**t!&#x22; See I&#x27;m already
quoting the movie, thats how good it is! That line always makes me
think of BTF so much! But anyway, there is really nothing wrong with
this film. Now, its not my favorite of the series.(OMG HOW DARE HE! HOW
DARE HE SAY BTF IS NOT HIS FAVORITE!!!! TROLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLLOL)
Yes, it is not my favorite IN MY OPINION! However, this is a fantastic
piece of work from Robert Zemeckis! As Doc Brown says:&#x22;If you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.&#x22; I have lived with that quote
in my head in my entire life to never give up on what you fight for!
Overall, I think this is a fantastic film in the time-travel genre and
deserves to be on the IMDb Top 250 List! &#x22;So, why don&#x27;t you make like a
tree, and get out of here!&#x22;
