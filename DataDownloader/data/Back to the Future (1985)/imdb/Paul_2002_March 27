I have seen all three movies so many times I can't count!  Word of advice:
WATCH ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME IN ORDER!  As a child, I saw each movie
as
they came out and I was bummed that the 3rd was the last and final
episode.
HEY YOU MOVIE WRITTERS!  MAKE ANOTHER ONE!<br /><br />Time travel is an interesting subject to bring up at the bar.  It's hard
to
even think about how the &quot;whole thing&quot; would even work.  Everyone would
want
to go back and &quot;change&quot; certain things, but would that really make things
any different?!
