i think this is a very insightful movie about the past. it truly depicts
events that have happened in that time. Marty is the main character he
metamorphosis's from a innocent teenager to a stronger monkey. the main
concern i have in this movie ( turn away if you have not seen it cause
this
may be a SPOLIer), is the fact that Marty meets his mum in the past so she
would recognise his face in the future, it does not deal with the whole
space time continuity. Also Albert Einsteins theory suggested it is
impossible to go back in time. going forwards is easy but backwards is
impossible. Also there was a lack of monkey's and penguins in this movie
and
too much emphasis on the time travel.<br /><br />Also the Doc should of been locked up in a metal asylum he is completely
deranged in the movie it is not good.<br /><br />All in all i thought it was a average movie and would give it 1 thumb up
or
a score of 6/10.
