Back to the Future, is one of my all time favorite movies.  My favorite
character in this movie is Biff.  He is the best in number two, when he
steals the kids's ball and says, &quot;Is this your ball, is this your ball,
then
go get it! Ha Ha Ha&quot; I also love it when Marty is trying to get the
magazine, and Biff sees him and tries to run him against the side of the
tunnel, and says, &quot; That'll teach him&quot; But the most memorable quote in the
movie is, &quot; What are you looking at butthead?&quot;  Biff is the man of the
movie, and should be given more credit. In my opinion, Marty ( Michael J
Fox), played his part well, but he was still a dork.
