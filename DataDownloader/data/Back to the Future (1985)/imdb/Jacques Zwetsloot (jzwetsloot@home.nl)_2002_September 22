2002_September 22 

I have seen this movie several times now but finally after waiting forever
for the trilogy of Back to the Future to be released on DVD I watched it
again.
It is still the movie I remember, some movies get dated but this one remains
as strong as the first viewing and now in glorious Widescreen DVD quality
and superb sound.
The actors are all great with of course especially Michael J. Fox of whom I
have been a huge fan from the beginning and just as great is Christopher
Lloyd.
The special effects are also great, every time you watch you see something
new and I am looking forward to watch the 2 sequels and all extras on the
DVD's, it may sound like a DVD commercial but it actually is one for the
whole trilogy, the greatest ever.
A big 10 for this movie
