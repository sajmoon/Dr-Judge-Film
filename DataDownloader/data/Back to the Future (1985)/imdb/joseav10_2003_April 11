2003_April 11 

This is a classic, a great movie. A mixture of comedy, adventure and
science
fiction superb. Perhaps, I have been this movie 20 times (in Spanish) and
4
or 5 times in English, and each time, I enjoy myself more and more... A
movie full of details, with unforgettable characters and performances...
the
parts 2 and 3 (The trilogy), perhaps, not reach this extraordinary level,
but the story continue, and you can find the same characteres in new
adventures, and this is something very special... I have found only a
problem, after three movies, the story ends... and believe me, that is
very
sad.
Someone defined the cinema, like a &quot;factory of dreams&quot;... This is a
dream.
