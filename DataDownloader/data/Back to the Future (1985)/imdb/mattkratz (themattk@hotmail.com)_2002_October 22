This ranks as one of my favorite movies of all time. Michael J. Fox and
Christopher Lloyd make a great duo as a teenager and a mad scientist
respectively. Fox gets sent back in time in a DeLorean time machine Lloyd
invented and threatens his own existence by interfering with his parents'
first meeting. Only Lloyd can help him get...back to the
future!<br /><br />I loved it the first time I saw it and like it even more every time I watch
it. From the opening sequence to Fox's being chased back in time to his
convincing Lloyd he's telling the truth to Biff's flubbing the old sayings
(why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?) to the dance to the
suspenseful scene towards the end-hey, what's not to love?<br /><br />A great movie!<br /><br />*** out of ****
