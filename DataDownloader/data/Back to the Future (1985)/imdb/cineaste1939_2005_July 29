The creative and entertaining science fiction content in this film
certainly is a draw. Aside from that, this film satisfies an urge most
of us have to know and experience what our parents were like when they
were young and falling in love, and to understand what it was life to
live in those times. The film's depiction of the contrasts between the
world of the 1950s and the 1980s gives viewers food for thought about
how our culture evolved, and what we've gained and lost in the process.
Performances are universally credible, sometimes brilliant, and advance
the plot nicely. Another point in this film's favor is amid all the
attractive technoflash, the director wasn't afraid to limn characters
who have real feelings.
