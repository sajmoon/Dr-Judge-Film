BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) ***1/2(out of ****) Directed by Robert Zemeckis.
Rated PG.<br /><br />The first, and best, of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, this movie is a
modern classic. Christopher Lloyd is marvelous as Dr. Emmett Brown and
young
Michael J. Fox shines as hapless 80's teen Marty McFly. I've enjoyed this
movie since childhood, and the DVD boxed set I was given for Christmas
last
year is a real treat, with some of the best special features out of any
DVD
I'd seen. I think that what makes this film so very special and popular is
that, in spite of all the sci-fi special effects elements, it never
forgets
to be a human story.<br /><br />The plot is simple, yet complicated, and I won't divulge it here. Well,
okay, maybe I will. Hell, you've probably already seen the film if you're
reading my article. For those of you who don't know, Marty gets
accidentally
sent back in time to the 50s, where he meets his parents (Lea Thompson and
a
hilariously geeky Crispin Glover) and the Doc who sent him back in the
first
place. Since he catches his mom's eye (ewww) he has to help his dad ask
his
mom out or else he'll cease to exist. Plus, he has to adjust to life in
the
50s. Got it!?<br /><br />This film could have been a disaster, a low-budget piece of 1980s
nonsense,
but it wasn't. Thanks to the talents of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, Glover,
director Robert Zemeckis and especially exec producer Steven (the Man)
Spielberg, you actually care about the characters. The script is witty,
the
effects are pretty good, and McFly even pretends he's Chuck Berry. Oh, and
look for Huey Lewis (80s pop-rocker) as a high school teacher. Very
entertaining movie, one of those very few movies you can enjoy with
friends,
by yourself, or with the entire family. Timeless and great
fun!
