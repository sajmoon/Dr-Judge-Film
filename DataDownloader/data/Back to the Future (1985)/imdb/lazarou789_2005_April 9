This is the best film of the Back to the future trilogy. This specific
trilogy is proof that most sequels are always worse than the original
(although the sequels of it are quite enjoyable but perform far from
the &quot;classic status&quot; of the original).<br /><br />Its a classic and probably the best movie of the 80s. It is very
enjoyable and engaging because you get drawn to it as you (in later
viewings) try to find the small hidden changes that come by alternating
the time-line.<br /><br />The cast is also brilliant - it was like they were born for these
roles: Christopher Lloyd is the perfect mad scientist, Michael J.Fox is
very believable playing a teen (although in his twenties) and Lea
Thompson is great (and obviously very talented) playing the different
Lorraines in different time zones. Unmissable for all the sci-fi
(especially those that have to do with time-lines - also see
Frequency)maniacs or 80s nostalgia maniacs or comedy maniacs or any of
the actors fans.
