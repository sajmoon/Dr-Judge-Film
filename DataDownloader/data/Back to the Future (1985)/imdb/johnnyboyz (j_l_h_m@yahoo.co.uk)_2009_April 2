The opening shots of Back to the Future set up the film&#x27;s ideas and
general tone. We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and
gizmos, within someone&#x27;s kitchen and living area, designed to
seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick
started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog
foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when
ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but
to what negative effect? It&#x27;s quite clear this area hasn&#x27;t been
occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell
for when the owner returns but what&#x27;s that compared to the fire hazards
in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually
branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but
with what, potentially quite terrible, results.<br /><br />Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel
tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being
revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able
to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are
or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly
homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the
protagonist&#x27;s actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know,
those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty
McFly&#x27;s rendition of &#x27;Johnny B. Goode&#x27; a great example. The film is a
near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains,
humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even
feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.<br /><br />Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen
career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to
a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain
Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The
film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955,
following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a
consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of
Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.<br /><br />As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family
entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding
scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured
when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going
back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before
the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep
within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of
then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the
same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on
ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in
the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in
the day; while shops and business&#x27; look shoddy, run down and some are
even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and
bristling with activity in the past.<br /><br />The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook
in the 1950s but we, as does the film&#x27;s lead, know the truth of what
becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film
shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald
Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty&#x27;s home
estate-to-be will be one of the &#x27;best places to live&#x27; come development,
but the harsh reality of it is that it&#x27;s anything but. This is
something the second film touches on more when the quality of living
deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be
this film&#x27;s antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing
Marty and Emmett&#x27;s brief but poignant conversation to do with how
unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in
1985.<br /><br />But while the film&#x27;s political slant isn&#x27;t its primary focus, you can&#x27;t
help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of
the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so
much better than the present day. Marty&#x27;s accidentally and ill advised
attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially
falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney
and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren&#x27;t played for sick laughs
and the film doesn&#x27;t linger on the actual notion as much as it does
focus on Marty&#x27;s reactions to all these realisations his would-be
mother is having towards him. The &#x27;park&#x27; scene in particular acts as an
example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly
dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction
to the predicament. It&#x27;s additionally easy to forget that, by the end,
his mother&#x27;s attention turns more towards George, like history should
be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for
this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.<br /><br />This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love
with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really
is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy,
arguably being the best of its &#x27;type&#x27; at the time of release. Producers
didn&#x27;t think people would take to it due to its lack of &#x27;risqu&#xE9;&#x27; but
years later, it stands head and shoulders above all the other &#x27;more
risqu&#xE9;&#x27; teen films that were released at that time.
