SEE &quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE&quot;. I know I opened 2 of my comments like this so
far, but I say this for a good reason. If your child says &quot;It&#39;s too
boyish.&quot;, &quot;It sounds boring.&quot;, or some other kind of whine or nasty
comment, MAKE them see it. I even said I wouldn&#39;t like it! I said it
with &quot;Star Wars&quot; too! Then my Dad FORCED me to see it, and now it&#39;s his
fault I enjoyed these movies from start to finish. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re
child will be overjoyed with these movies too. If your a kid or
teenager, take it from a 9-year-old, you&#39;ll adore it. If you came here
looking for a plot line, sorry! In my opinion, one little hint at the
movie could destroy one of the surprises, making the goodness of the
plot crumble before your very eyes!!! That was a little too dramatic,
but who cares! It&#39;s still a good movie, and you understood that. All in
all, this is a terrific trilogy, which the world will cherish
forevermore. &#39;Nuff Said!
