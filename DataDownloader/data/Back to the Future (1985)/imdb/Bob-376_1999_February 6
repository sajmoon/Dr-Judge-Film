1999_February 6 

Michael J Fox accidently travels into the past in a time machine and gets
into situations that threaten his own existence.  This Sci-fi comedy has
everything you could wish for.  It is a lot of fun from beginning to end and
I would also say it is one of my all time favourite movies.
