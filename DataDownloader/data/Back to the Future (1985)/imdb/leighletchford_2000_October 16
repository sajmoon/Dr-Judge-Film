This movie is sheer sci-fi entertainment at it's best and funniest. It's
the
kind of movie that improves with each viewing, as you can always notice
something that you have overlooked previously. The casting of the leads
(Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) is perfect, Fox as the curious
teenager and Lloyd as the crazy scientist. The 2 sequels are just as good
too. Crispin Glover is also good as Marty Mcfly's nerdy father.<br /><br />I give it a 9/10
