Christopher Lloyd plays a doctor who creates a time travel machine and has
his young colleague played by Michael J. Fox go back to the year 1955.But
when Fox arrives in '55 he is startled to find out that he can't get back to
1985.<br /><br />Imaginative science fiction yarn is exciting all around.Lloyd steals the
show, while Fox is amiable as the stranded kid.I love the scene where Fox is
blown away by the loud speaker.<br /><br />Rating:**** (out of five)
