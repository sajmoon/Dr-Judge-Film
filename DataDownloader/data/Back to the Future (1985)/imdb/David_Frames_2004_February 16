Back to the Future concerns itself with an accidental trip into the
past facilitated by a converted Delorean Sports Car. What isn&#39;t fully
explored is the role that poor production values, industrial
incompetence and the subsidies of the British Taxpayer, propping up a
failing and corrupt American adventure capitalist, played in Marty
Mcfly&#39;s near-on temporal suicide and submission to incest.<br /><br />The time machine was the product of substandard labour from a
ill-trained Ulster work force. In an area where zealots and murderers
had ruined the local economy in the pursuit of an imagined community
but with an all-consuming disdain for democracy and the value of human
life, Delorean had stepped in, not for altruistic purposes but because
of tax breaks afforded to him by the then Labour Government who were
desperate to do something about the stifling level of provincial
unemployment. If these men couldn&#39;t get jobs then they might be tempted
to take up arms and join the mob, knee capping young men under the
pretext of collusion of the Unionists and the British Army or, if there
was no such man, kidnap mothers in front of their children and shoot
them in the head. Thus mainland British taxpayers, who worked hard and
had no part in the religious hatred that had ruined this community,
began to have their cash syphoned off for the sake of a PR initiative.
At stake - the vanity and greed of John Delorean, a man who saw the
local fat, semi-literate workforce with their half-baked, bigoted
ideals as the perfect contingent to fashion his overpriced, poorly
designed sports car. The stainless steel construction would later be
cited as conducive to allowing the mechanism of time travel to take
place but in practice it was the cars poor acceleration and botched
circuitry that would prove more decisive when Marty was forced to flee
for his life from Libyan terrorists. Marty&#39;s odyssey into the past
nearly wiped out his existence and could have lead to sexual
intercourse with his mother. At the root of it all we may look to the
folly of cheap Labour, poor management and a cheated British
electorate.<br /><br />Some good laughs.
