Excellent film!  Michael J. Fox in his most memorable role.  I'm glad the
part didn't go to Eric Stoltz, who was the original Marty McFly.  Michael J.
Fox was very good and very amusing, it was perfect for him.  This is the
best of the trilogy.  To me the original is always the best.  The music
brings excitement and the feel of time traveling.  A very enjoyable movie.
