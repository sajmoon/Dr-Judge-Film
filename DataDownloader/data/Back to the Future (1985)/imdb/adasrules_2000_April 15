I'm not going to divulge the plot of this film to you.  Chances are you've
already seen it and know how wonderful it is.  All I'm going to say about
the film is that it stands out as being one of the most visually and
iconoclastic movies about the 80's.  Attitude, Walkman's, Skateboards, Van
Halen, Rock bands, sports cars and Toyota 4x4's.  Visually clashing with
the
apparent 'innocence' that was the 1950's, sans Marty's hormone driven
mother.  This film remains a 'time piece' of the teenage view of a decade
that has come under a lot of flak.  Speaking as a teenager reflecting on
the
end of the last decade, Back to the Future reminds us that the 80's weren't
all that bad right?  Right?
