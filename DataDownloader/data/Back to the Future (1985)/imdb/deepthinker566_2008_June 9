My review of Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s Back to the Future, This has to do with
a teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and a scientist Dr Emmett Brown
&#x22;Doc&#x22; (Christophor Lloyd) went back in time to 1955. Actually Marty was
going back in time, because Doc was shot and he was already there in
1955. Things have changed around Hill Valley in 1955. Well there&#x27;s a
young George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson).
Things go fine until Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) shows up. Now things
turn creepy when Emmett Brown does not know Marty in the 50&#x27;s. They
have to get back to 1985 by a bolt of lightning, which it strikes at
night. Now they have to get George and Lorraine to the school dance.
Now Marty is prepared to back to 1985. Then Emmett was suspecting that
Marty was supposed to go back, but he came back from the future. It&#x27;s a
absolute classic, and I would recommend watching this, especially on
TV, or on the trilogy set on DVD (Which I have, but unfortunately, I
only have the full frame version, I don&#x27;t have the widescreen version
of this, sorry) But it doesn&#x27;t matter, you get the movie anyway. About
the movie, well done special effects, great acting, and great directing
from Robert Zemeckis.<br /><br />Back to the Future gets 10/10 stars
