I love the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies so much! These movies are a part
of my life. In fact, I know about 99.9% of just about everything to
memory! Plus, every time I watch these movies, I always find something
new, interesting, or something that never really caught on to me
before! That is how much I love &quot;Back to the Future.&quot; I like part one
because this is where it all begins. The beginning part with the dog
feeder (the robotic arm, electric can opener, and a very funny whirring
noise) and quite possibly the biggest amp in the history of the
universe with that weird, rising ethereal hum got me on the floor, not
only laughing, but imitating that part of the film, too! What about
everything in Marty's house, from the TV playing &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;
rerun to that ugly Panasonic clock radio? Priceless! Ooh, don't forget
the JCPenney lot of the mall (which will remain unnamed because I'm not
turning on the spoiler alert for this review) with the van and the
DeLorean time machine coming out! Just watch this movie for more stuff!
Oh, and to let y'all know: I've seen the three movies on DVD and I love
them very, very much!
