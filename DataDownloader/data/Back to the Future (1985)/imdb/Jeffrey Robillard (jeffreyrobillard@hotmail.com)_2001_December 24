The greatest film of all time period. Michael J.Fox's best performance. A
sheer delight in story, tone, family elements, and fantasy. No other film to
my knowledge has proven to be so popular with fans and the society. Released
in 1985 the film proved to be the sleeper hit of 1985 and redefined the time
travel genre in terms of story and characterizations. The film's soundtrack
is awesome with modern hits from Huey Lewis and the News, Lindsey
Buckingham, Eric Clapton, composer Alan Silvestri and classic hits from Etta
James and Marvin Berry(Harry Waters Jr.) and the Starlighters with special
guest Marty McFly(Fox).  Lastly, the greatest time travel adventure to date
with imaginative special effects and heart pounding excitement.
