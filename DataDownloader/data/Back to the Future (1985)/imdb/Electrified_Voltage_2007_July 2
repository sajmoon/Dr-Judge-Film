I first saw &quot;Back to the Future&quot; years ago, but it really didn&#39;t do
much for me. I saw it again several years later, and don&#39;t recall
thinking much of it during that viewing, either. However, after
watching the highly acclaimed Robert Zemeckis movie again recently
(this time a good few years after my last viewing, I believe), although
I still can&#39;t exactly call it one of my favourite features, I now
understand why it has such wide appeal! <br /><br />In 1985, Marty McFly is a teenager who is not exactly popular with his
peers, but does have a girlfriend named Jennifer Parker. His best
friend is Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown, an oddball local scientist. One
night, Marty meets Doc out in a parking lot, where he is to assist the
scientist with his new invention, a time machine made by a car! To make
the machine powerful enough, Doc has used plutonium, which he got from
a terrorist group who were expecting him to make a bomb with it!
Unfortunately, just as Doc is about to travel through time, the
terrorists track him down and shoot him! They then go after Marty, who
manages get away in Doc&#39;s machine, but ends up being transported to the
year 1955, back when his parents were around his age! Eventually, he
meets the Doc of that time and manages to figure out a way to get back
to 1985 with his assistance. However, Marty also learns that he has
altered history, and must somehow get his parents together in order to
save his very existence! <br /><br />This movie may start out a tad sluggish, but for the vast majority of
the approximate two hours that it runs for, it is consistently
entertaining! Most of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is very exciting, with a lot
of action, and it also works reasonably well as a comedy, with quite a
few laughs here and there. Basically, the main cast members all nothing
less than reasonable in their performances (I haven&#39;t noticed any
really bad ones during any of my several viewings). The most notable
performance (one that&#39;s definitely MORE than reasonable) is that of
Christopher Lloyd, who fits the role of Doc Brown very well. The movie
wouldn&#39;t quite be the same without this character and his antics! For
all those reasons, this first installment in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot;
trilogy is one fine accomplishment! <br /><br />Over two decades after the release of this sci-fi comedy, it remains
extremely popular. It&#39;s current position in the IMDb Top 250 is
obviously proof of that. No movie can please 100% of its viewers, but
clearly, the majority of people who have seen &quot;Back to the Future&quot; at
any point in the past 22 years have enjoyed it, and that&#39;s a lot of
people, so the film deserves a lot of credit! If you usually like to
see the sci-fi and comedy genres combined, and you haven&#39;t seen this
particular combination of the two for any reason, I strongly suggest
you watch it as soon as possible!
