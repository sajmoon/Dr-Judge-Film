I love Back to the Future! Not only does it beat Star Wars, it also
beats many more movies of its kind. Its so suspenseful, and yet, so
touching and sweet. Its also hilarious to think that if you went back
in time ur mother would fall in love with you! It presents a possible
way of time travel. I love the Delorean, I want to get one. I love the
scene at the clocktower in which Marty goes back to 1985. And I love
the scene at the end where marty and the doc go back to the future, and
doc says one his famous lines, &quot;where we're going we don't need roads!&quot;
If you want something that the entire family would enjoy, get Back to
the Future. I will say that you will need a curse-free DVD or vcr, for
the movie has foul language in it, but other than that, ur good to go!
