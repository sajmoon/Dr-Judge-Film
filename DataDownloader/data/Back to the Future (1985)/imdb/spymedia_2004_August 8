The minute I saw Michael J. Fox in Doc's house putting in wires here
and there connecting to the large speaker and then it blasts-I was
laughing away! I have hardly seen any movie that starts of funny! The
making of the car is brilliant and I thinks that with so little special
effects it is really the best! Many movies have this thing about
wishes, they wish for it and ta da it happens-but hello how did it
happen?! This car thing is really good for imagination and really
persuades people to enjoy and let their fantasies fly with the
characters in the movie. The best part I liked-I was snickering, when
Michael-'Marty' is hit and found by Lorraine who is actually his mother
brings him into her house and she has some feelings for him and 'wants
him'-he freaks out! That was really funny, like I never thought of such
a case when he is to see his parents in high school. It was really
cool! The imagination is so rich that you feel like you are in the
movie and enjoying the humor and the tensions that Marty has! There was
one thing that bothered me-by the end of the movie when Marty wakes up
and he walks by the dining room he stops and sees something really
weird, there are different furniture and he spots his brother in his
business suit and is unaware what it is, then he sees his parents and
then collapses&#133; how did he end up here when his parents look older and
there is new furniture which he wasn't familiar with and he ended up
having a jeep? Plus when Doc turns up he has a new way of making gas&#133;
It's confusing! But it didn't really matter because the movie was the
greatest! I wouldn't mind if they make a newer version of these series
of Back to the Future, with more visual effects and more action!
