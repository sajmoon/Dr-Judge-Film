Christopher Lloyd stars alongside Michael J. Fox in the fantastic Back
to the Future. Essentially, the plot revolves around time travel&#x97; Marty
McFly (Fox) goes back in time, messes around, and accidentally causes
his mother to fall in love with him instead of his father. He has to
fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I
couldn&#x27;t help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra&#x27;s &#x22;It&#x27;s a
Wonderful Life&#x22; (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be
thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is
simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty
discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in
general, the film proves to be enjoyable.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really
epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant
tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to
the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the
viewer even more.<br /><br />I will freely admit that the film&#x27;s outcome is evident from the very
beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of
fun, unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of
discussion for hours (although I&#x27;ve avoided it here for spoiler
purposes). A great movie.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 10/10
