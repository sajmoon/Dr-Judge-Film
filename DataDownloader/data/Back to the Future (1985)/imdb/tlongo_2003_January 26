I first saw &quot;Back to the Future part II&quot; in 1989 and it ignited my passion
for movies.  I wore out the cassettes of all three films and just about
wore
out the &quot;Secrets...&quot; video with Kirk Cameron.  They are without a doubt my
favorite movies of all time (not too crazy about Part III, but it's still
great), and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale couldn't have been more right
with
writing this film.<br /><br />Although the movies are excellent, the direction is right on, and the cast
is about as good as it gets, there is one person the movie couldn't have
succeeded without: Michael J. Fox.  In 1985, Fox was at the height of his
career, both with the Republican Alex P. Keaton of &quot;Family Ties&quot; and with
his performance in the film &quot;Teen Wolf.&quot;  I read his autobiography &quot;Lucky
Man&quot; and learned about the fact the producer of &quot;Family Ties&quot; was the one
that held the script for &quot;Future&quot; back in the first place, which is what
made Zemeckis, Gale, and Spielberg go with Eric Stolz.  Don't get me
wrong,
Stolz may be a talented guy, but there is NO WAY Marty McFly would work
with
Fox at the helm.  His portrayal is timeless, as is the rest of the film.<br /><br />From Christopher Lloyd, to Thomas F. Wilson, and even all the way to Billy
Zane (one of Biff's henchmen), the film is perfect.  To grab a cast like
this, it was &quot;density&quot;, I mean, it was DESTINY.
