This film is one of the best just like the whole trilogy. It's about a
time-travel from 85 to 55, from the lifeguard-jacket-age to the rock and
roll era. The main character Marty McFly save his father's life but the
result is that his mother fell in love into him. So the lesson is given:he
have to make his parents to fall in love into each other.
