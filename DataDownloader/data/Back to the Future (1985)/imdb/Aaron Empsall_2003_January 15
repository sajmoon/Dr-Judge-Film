This movie is incredible. I don&#x27;t really know anyone who hasn&#x27;t seen
it, but I&#x27;m sure those people exist. Really, this has Sci-Fi, Comedy,
Action, Drama, everything. This is Michael J Fox at his best! All I can
say is 10 out of 10 and Buy the DVD too. Back to the Future brings all
the 80&#x27;s kitsch and combines it with all the fantasy that you want out
of a movie that makes you a happier person after watching it. The
casting in this movie is iconic. I couldn&#x27;t imagine Eric Stoltz as
Marty McFly, because of Fox&#x27;s performance, but now I would like to see
it just to know. I truly think that BTTF can change people&#x27;s lives and
impact their outlooks. Oh yeah, did I say this was good?
