Back to the Future (1985) was the film that launched Michael J. Fox's
career into the stratosphere. This film not only made him into an
eighties superstar but it also made Back to the Future a part of
Americana and a slight fixture upon Hollywood for a few years there
after. This film was so successful that it was made into a trilogy.<br /><br />The film follows a high school student Marty Mc Fly (Michael J. Fox)
who's not pleased with the way his life has been going. He always feels
that there's more to his life than what there appears to be. When he's
not spending time with his girlfriend or his band, Marty is best
friends with an eccentric inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc
Brown is on the verge of breaking through his latest discovery. Marty
watches his family and notice's how broken down they are. But when he
see's that the family car is wrecked he loses it. There goes his date!
This dilemma isn't nothing compared to what Doc Brown has in store for
him!<br /><br />This film is the perfect example of an eighties film. The fashion and
style is in your face. Crispin Glover (who plays the Marty father)
steals the show with his neurotic style of acting. He portrays Marty
with an underlining manic presence. Michael J. Fox makes a somewhat
believable teenager and Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown
(another character who's a borderline basket case), Eighties stars Lea
Thompson, Casey Simezsko, Courtney Gaines and future star Billy Zane
appear in this one as well.<br /><br />I happen to enjoy this film. The sequel was entertaining as well. But
the final chapter was a weak effort by all. If you like Michael J. Fox
or Cripsin Glover I advise you to check this flick out.<br /><br />Recommended.
