What a wonderful this movie is! I&#39;m Korean and i live in Gwang-ju
Korea.<br /><br />Although i&#39;m Korean, I&#39;ve ever watched this movie in Television, Then I
was attracted to &#39;Back to the future&#39; BTTF is based on scientific
theory, and has lovely character, and elaborated story line.<br /><br />I watched all series of BTTF and The best one of them is BTTF 1.<br /><br />And the more series number larger, the less funny.<br /><br />I was born in 1990 and this movie was made in 1985.<br /><br />So I could think that this movie was out-dated but I did&#39;t.<br /><br />um.. I don&#39;t have anything to write..<br /><br />Because I&#39;m not good at English... so this writing has many bad
grammars..
