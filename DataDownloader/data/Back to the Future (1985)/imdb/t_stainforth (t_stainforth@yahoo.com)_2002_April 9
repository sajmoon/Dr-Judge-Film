I have liked Back to the Future since I was a kid. It has a 
fascinating story and concept, but I think that the concept might be
too much of the reason why I like it. The story is hugely
entertaining, especially the first time you watch it, but there are so
many plot holes and vaguely idiotic concepts that it can start to be
a bit annoying. I won't get into the plot holes, since they really don't
matter, as they say, you just have to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />However, the 1950s are presented in such a cliche way that I think
the movie misses a chance. So many people see the 1950s as a
perfect time, a clean, simpler time, that movies just reflect this
common misperception. The truth though is that the 50s was a
time with its problems and issues too. I don't think that the movie
should have been used as some sort of documentary, or 
educational opportunity, but I think it would have been more
interesting if the moviemakers hadn't relied so much on cliches.
For example, everything is clean, wholesome, the soda bar, etc... It
would have been fun to make more fun of Marty's perceptions of
the time.<br /><br />Also, the fact that he changes 1985 &quot;for the better&quot; is kind of stupid.
He wouldn't know any of those people, his family, or his girlfriend.
They would all be totally different. He might have been better off
staying in 1955 since the end result would have been the same,
and he wouldn't have to cope with that sort of freakshow.<br /><br />Those are only minor problems, I think it would have been a better
movie if they had taken those two points into consideration, but it
still is a really fun movie.
