One of my favourite films ever.
I remember watching it when it first came out on video and no film since
has
come near it.
It is the perfect Sci-fi/Comedy and like the other guy said no matter how
many times you see it, it still is as fresh as ever. This is probably due
to
having one of the most perfect movie formulas in history. Steven
Spielberg,
Robert Zemeckis, Michael J Fox and a DeLorean. I'm 24 years old now but
when
I went to Universal studios at Christmas and saw the actual car, it was
like
my Graceland (Is that sad?) I have owned the box set for years but
probably
need a new one as i've worn mine out. Every child (and Film Producer)
needs
to see this movie at least once because it will show them what proper kids
movies are supposed to be like. Excellent sequels too. I recommend reading
Michael J Fox's book as well, it's excellent.
