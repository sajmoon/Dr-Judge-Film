This movie. How do I begin to describe it. It&#x27;s classic, it&#x27;s
wonderful, it&#x27;s just a fun ride from start to finish. I won&#x27;t spoil it
so I&#x27;ll just say why I think it&#x27;s good. The characters are memorable
and funny. The science behind time travel isn&#x27;t complicated, it&#x27;s well
explained. It&#x27;s well detailed and if you look closely, you&#x27;ll notice
something each time you watch it that you didn&#x27;t before. If I continue
to explain why it&#x27;s good, this could be a book.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Yes I recommend this to anyone who likes a sci-fi
film. I recommend it to anyone who likes a comedy film. I recommend
this to anyone. It&#x27;s a classic I&#x27;ll never forget, and I hope it is for
those who have yet to see it.
