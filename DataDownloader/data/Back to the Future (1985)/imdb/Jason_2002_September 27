Everyone has seen this movie (if, not shame on you).  It's an 80's
classic.  It's the kind of a movie that makes you stop flipping through
channels and watch.  It's a great way to remeber the 80's ,without movies
like this we'd rather forget such a time,.  Even if you didn't know when
the
movie was made, you could take an educated guess from combination of
Michael
J Fox and Hewey Lewis.  Even if you don't appreciate the 80's I'm sure
you'll enjoy the movie.  You might even hear yourself saying things like,
&quot;Great scotts&quot;, and &quot;Hello McFly, is anybody in there?&quot;.  In a time that
we
were being attacked by a &quot;Flock of Seagulls&quot; and Boy Georges that acted
more
like girl Georges, we were able to find some good.  Thank you Back to the
Future.
