my favorite part of &quot;Back To The Future&quot; was when the professor yelled
out 1.21 gigawatt's. that part cracks me up still today and i don't get
tired of hearing that part nor tired of the movie. i loved it. This was
a great movie because the ideas seemed almost plausible. This movie and
the other ones showed you just how much of an impact any small change
in the past could affect the outcome of the future. I thought the cast
was a great fit for &quot;Back To The Future.&quot; Michael J. Fox does a great
job as Marty McFly. There were quite a few funny parts of the movie
that i just couldn't stop laughing about. i can't think of a movie that
i have watched as much and not get bored with except for &quot;The Karate
Kid.&quot;
