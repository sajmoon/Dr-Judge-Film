Back to the Future was not expected to be what it became. Shot with an
impossible schedule as Michael J Fox was committed to Family Ties, and
made into a series of three films, 20 years on they remain fresh and
entertaining (not even the nationality of the terrorists needs
updating!).<br /><br />The plot, while it is original and cheeky, is based on a classic time
travel plot, and could be expected to age fast. It is not the case, and
it remains a solid family value entertainment... the sort of films you
can expect your kids to watch over and over again. I suppose the whole
skateboard and matchmaking your mum and dad must be part of the
timeless magic of the script.<br /><br />So only one thing to do: buy a collector&#39;s three film box set and
you&#39;ll know what sound investment means when they have been watched 20
times plus and your kids ask if they can watch it AGAIN.
