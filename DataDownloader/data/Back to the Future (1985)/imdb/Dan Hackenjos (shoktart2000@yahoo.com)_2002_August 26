This is one of my Top Ten Favorite Movies of All-Time!<br /><br />I have probably seen this movie more than any other, and I will never get
sick of seeing it again. <br /><br />I grew up wanting to be like Michael J. Fox, and this movie was a big reason
why. He's a stud!<br /><br />The attention to detail in this movie, and the sequels, is one of the
reasons why it is so great. I love time-travel movies, but this is the best
one by far.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd &amp; Crispin Glover are excellent in their roles. There is so
much to like about this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to see
it again. Along with Empire Strikes Back &amp; Return of the Jedi, this is my
favorite movie made in the '80's.
