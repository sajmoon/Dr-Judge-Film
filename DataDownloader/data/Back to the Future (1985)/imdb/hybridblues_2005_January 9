2005_January 9 
I got a chance to see this movie again, being at least 12 or 13 years
since I saw it last and I think it's still great. I love it now as much
if not better than when I was young.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox &amp; Christopher Lloyd are great, Crispin Glover was superb
(as usual) as well as Lea Thompson and Thomas Wilson. There are some
great moments especially when George McFly tries to impress Lorraine at
the restaurant, that was pretty hysterical as well as Biff and his
friends chasing Marty and running into the manure truck. The cast and
supporting cast were incredible, no other actors I don't think could've
pulled it off so well. . You'll always remember Michael J. Fox as
Marty, Christopher Lloyd as Doc and Crispin Glover as George Mcfly. I
like the other 2 movies as well but I think the 2nd one would've been
better if Glover took the role as George again. In my opinion he made
the first movie.<br /><br />I was glad to see this timeless classic again and I highly recommend it
to those who haven't seen it. One of the best time travel movies ever
made. 9 out of 10
