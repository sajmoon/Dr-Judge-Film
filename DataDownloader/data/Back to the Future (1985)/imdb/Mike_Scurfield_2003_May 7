This movie will always be special for me as it's the first movie I ever
saw,
and it's still one of my favourites.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen it, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a regular
kid
living in Hill Valley, he skateboards, he's late to school, and he's
embarrassed by his parents.  He is friends with 'crazy' scientist Dr.
Emmett
Brown (wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd), whose new invention turns
Martys' life upside down.<br /><br />Marty accidentally sends himself back to 1955, where he manages to stop
his
own parents from meeting each other.  With no power for the DeLorean time
machine, and no where else to go, he hooks up with (a slightly younger)
Doc
to get his parents back together before the inevitable happens... he isn't
born!<br /><br />This movie is great in that it links a good story with even better
characters. Full of funny moments, and quotable lines, this movie also
sets
up some great running gags which continue in the sequels (Marty waking up
in
bed thinking it was all a dream, the 'borrowing' of a skateboard, Biff &amp;
manure). Plus I think that this film has the best 'race against time'
ending
I've ever seen. (Doubled by not only getting his parents back together
before he disappears, but also not missing his one single chance to get
back
to 1985).<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet then you really should, I can't recommend it
enough.  It's a great family film which can be enjoyed by anyone.  If it's
been a while since you saw it, go back and watch it again, you'll be
amazed
at how many great bits you'll have forgotten about. A very exciting movie,
a
true adventure in every sense of the word, which is held together by a
sound
moral core: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything'.
