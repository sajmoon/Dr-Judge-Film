Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop
culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such
notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day,
there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and
cash-in on its success.
This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're
guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie
that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally
difficult.  I'd know.<br /><br />The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could
almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark
nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie
like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In
some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be
serious.<br /><br />With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if
George Lucas was involved.<br /><br />Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality,
even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well
worth your time.
