We are talking CHARM-CLASSIC!<br /><br />We are talking AMERICAN-CLASSIC<br /><br />This is a very good movie, I have always loved it, even though it has got a
bit ruined since they show it at TV about 35 times a year. But I still love
it. Michael J Fox is funny, but Christopher Lloys is even better than he was
in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUUCKO'S NEST. It is a character both similar and
un-similar to each other. <br /><br />It's a charming and original film with BIFF, the guy we love to hate (I
think he's so great I can't hate him).<br /><br />Part II was a bit of a dissapointment, part III was very good, but this one
is by far the best in the trilogy.
