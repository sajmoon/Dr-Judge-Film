When I was a little kid, i lived this movie. Marty Mcfly was my idol!! now
I
look back on it, and i see the cleverness of the film at that time mixed
with that legendary feel. You know what feel I'm talking about. Though this
film may have seemed a bit corny at times. It is a classic that should be
respected for it's feel good aspect. I give it a 10 just because I grew up
with this movie and it has affected my life, thought I may not even know
it.
hehe.
