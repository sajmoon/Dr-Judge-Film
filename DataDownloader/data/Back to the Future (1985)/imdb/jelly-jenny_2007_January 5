I really loved this film. The first time I saw it was on the t.v a
while ago. The 2nd and 3rd film are excellent as well. They are all
incredibly clever and the cast is fantastic. If you want to see this
film I recommend you buy it on DVD as its only around &pound;3.99! Or if you
like all the films read the P.S bit at the end of this comment to find
out where to get it!<br /><br />It film revolves around Marty (Michael J Fox) going back to 1955 and
meeting his dad George McFly( Crispin Glover). Marty&#39;s mum ( Lea
Thompson) ends up falling in love with Marty when he saves his dad from
getting hit by a tree. Its then up to Marty to get his mum and dad back
together before its to late!<br /><br />P.S: I got the trilogy DVD box set for &pound;14.99! WOW! from HMV!
