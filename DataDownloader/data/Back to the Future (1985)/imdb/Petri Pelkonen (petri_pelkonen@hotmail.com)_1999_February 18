Back to the Future is one of the best movies I have ever
seen.
Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do a great acting
job
in it and so do all the other actors. Tom Wilson is great as Biff. All the
parts of Back to the Future trilogy are great,and
if they made BTTF4,I bet it would be great too. This movie is worth watching
many times.
