This has to be one of the funnest movies I have ever seen. Everything works
great in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. One of the best attributes about this movie
is that it has a great script, which is very smart and snappy. The story is
very exciting and keeps you absolutely riveted to the action. Once Marty
gets warped into 1955, there is just no stopping the excitement. Something
else I think is great about the script is that it does a good job of making
the characters likeable (or in the case of the bad guys, hateable). The
movie is given some good direction from Rob Zemeckis, who keeps the movie
following well, which keeps story interesting. The acting was superb,
especially from Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Fox makes for a
perfect Marty McFly and Lloyd simply chews up the scenery as the eccentric
Doc Brown. And I can't forget Crispin Glover who plays the nerdy, but
likeable George. Seeing George finally take his stand against Biff was one
of the biggest highlights of the movie. I was actually cheering at that
part!  Overall this is a must-see film. Don't miss &quot;Back to the
Future&quot;!<br /><br />Star Rating: 5 out of 5.
