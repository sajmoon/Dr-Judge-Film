We've all looked in our parents picture albums of their childhood. In
back to the future you can see what actually happened.<br /><br />Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has made a time machine out of a
DeLorean. Modern day (1985) teenager Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox)
accidentally travels back in time to the year 1955, interrupts his
parents first meeting and has to get them together without affecting
the time-line.<br /><br />Back to the Future (1985) is a sci-fi, drama, comedy but above all,
feel good movie that draws from almost every film genre, as a result
there's something there to enjoy for everyone. Watching multiple times
is preferred to pick up the subtle details (watch the name of the
mall).<br /><br />This movie along with it's two sequels is one of the few films that you
can watch over and over again and it never gets boring. The sheer joy,
the adventure, the humor and the basic themes and questions it deals
with, make this to be one of the best films ever created.<br /><br />Also a great film for kids to have fun and learn something about how
live was in the 80's and 50's at the same time.<br /><br />I can't wait for a future re-release that is re-edited so that the
entire trilogy can be watched as one six hour long film without
interruptions.<br /><br />10/10
