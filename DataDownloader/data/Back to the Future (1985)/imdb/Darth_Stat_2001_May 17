This is one of the best flicks from the 80's, it is basically just family
mind candy but it's charm is relentless and there is not another movie you
can have more fun with, it's sequels come the closest.<br /><br />So what would happen if you could travel back in time and meet your parents,
anyone seen time cop, they break the rule that they so strongly state, a
single alteration in the time would probably cause a time and space melt
down, though all scientific theory is completely hypathetical in this matter
assumptions can be made. As for causing your parents not to meet at exactly
the right time you would not exist regardless of wether they got together or
not. But stuff like that if they got serious in the movie would make this
from the No. 1 time travel movie to on a par with every other one.<br /><br />No one has ever come up with a better time machine, that delorian with the
gullwing doors is one I'd like to know even though the company went bust.
The action, setting and especially the acting in these movies had to be
perfect or they would have been a B grade mess, and since they were all
perfect no more needs to be said.<br /><br />Spielberg really proved his nouse backing Zemekis' idea with this one, and
Zemekis proved great directing skills which he was awarded for a decade
later. It's a shame neither are very present today despite Zemekis' latest
blockbuster What Lies Beneath, another pinacle-of-the-genre. Back To The
Future deserves no less than a 10.
