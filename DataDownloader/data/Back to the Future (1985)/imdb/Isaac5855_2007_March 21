BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly
established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and
officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox
replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager
whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher
Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a
time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he
meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in
order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly
mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox
is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as
Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents.
Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in
Marty&#39;s life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of
genuine warmth here and there. If you&#39;ve never seen it, treat yourself.
Follwed by two sequels.
