2008_February 17 
When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid
entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two
sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after
an absence of time, I saw it again in the late &#39;90s and was shocked to
hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and &quot;PG-rated,&quot;
to boot).<br /><br />Also, the character &quot;Biff&quot; (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he
must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could
say the same about &quot;Marty&#39;s&quot; father (Crispin Glover), who was a
disgusting wuss. <br /><br />I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and
there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd&#39;s
&quot;Emmet Brown&quot; are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an
even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.<br /><br />The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction,
etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to
include all that &quot;language&quot; is a mystery to me, except that it&#39;s the
twisted world of Hollywood.
