There are few things I remember in my life, my memory is not so good,
but one thing i will never forget is seeing Back to the Future in movie
theaters. It was an almost religious experience, even as a kid I knew I
was seeing something special. And it stuck with me, something I have
passed onto my daughter who now has a crush on Marty. Not what I was
wanting, but its a start. Plus how can you go wrong with a movie that
has given us so many classic quotes? Michael J Fox at his best,
Christopher Lloyd at his funniest since Taxi and that theme song...I
still get chills when I hear it. A great movie and a movie experience
to be shared.
