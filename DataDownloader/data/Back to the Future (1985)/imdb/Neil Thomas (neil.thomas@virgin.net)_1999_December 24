1999_December 24 

Back to the Future is an absolute classic film.  It has
just
the right amount of action / sci-fi and plenty of comedy.  George McFly is
an absolute classic character. &quot;You mean you're gonna go touch her on
her...&quot;<br /><br />The whole trilogy is great, but the first remains the best, and one of my
favourite films of all time.
