It&#x27;s time... to go back. With those 5 words I was taken back to a place
I could only dream about. The year 1955, my mother was only a year old,
I wasn&#x27;t even born yet, gasoline was only 20 cents a gallon and coffee
was a nickel. Ahh those were the good old days, when there were no cell
phones, no Google and lighting struck the clock tower at exactly 10:04
pm. I love this movie and I have to say that it is an absolute classic,
from beginning to end. The entire trilogy is fantastic and I&#x27;m so glad
that it&#x27;s coming back for a 25th anniversary celebration.<br /><br />Congratulations to Zemeckis and Spielberg, well done but there is just
one thing, could you please make Back to the Future Part 4. Look at
Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, or Star Wars, mega successful
film series, why did Back to the Future have to stop at Part 3. This
movie would not have been the same if Michael J. Fox had not been cast
as Marty McFly, so once again well done. This movie has maintained a
cult following, it&#x27;s still popular. Great Scott!
