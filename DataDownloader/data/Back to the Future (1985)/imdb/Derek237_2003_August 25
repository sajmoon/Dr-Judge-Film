All the reasons I love this movie have already been said many times
here before. Back To The Future is just a generally great movie, it's
the best of its kind. It has a great story and everything comes
together so perfectly in the end.<br /><br />I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I was sick in the
hospital. I felt so bad being sick, but the movie was so great that it
made me forget. It's always been close to my heart. I still enjoy
watching it now as much as I did then. Oddly enough, it took me almost
10 years to finally get around to watching part II.<br /><br />I picked up the DVD trilogy recently and believe me, it has everything
a fan of Back To The Future could possibly ask for.<br /><br />My rating: 10/10
