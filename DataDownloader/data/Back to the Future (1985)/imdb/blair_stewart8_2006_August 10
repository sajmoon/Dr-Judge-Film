Well i first laid eyes upon Back to the Future when i was only a small
boy. Straight away i was mesmirised. It was the first film that i
watched over and over again and then the second one came out and then a
third. Robert Zemeckis has done a great job on this picture, the script
is solid and the acting is incredible from both &quot;Marty&quot; and &quot;Doc.&quot; The
way that all the films tie into each other is perfect scripting. A
Great film for the family, the kid, the teenager or the geeky adult, it
is a good example of a Perfect film. This film is to this day the one
of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen and will continue to love it over the
years.
