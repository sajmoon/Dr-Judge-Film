What I especially liked about &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; is that the events and
time 
machine itself were original and were not too fiction.  I liked the idea
that the time 
machine was made out of a DeLorean and looked homemade, rather than a
detailed 
and &quot;perfect&quot; time machine.  The conflict for the plot was creative and the
actors 
were perfect for this film!  10/10!
