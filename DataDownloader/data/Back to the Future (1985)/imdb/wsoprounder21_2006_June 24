I recently have been collecting movies and one I constantly come back
to is Back To The Future. The nostalgic feel of the movie with its
contemporary portions set the stage for this film that you will enjoy
watching over and over again. The casting was fantastic, the scripts
well done, and the pacing excellent. Throughout our generation and
those next we will all search for that flux capacitor that will show us
what has made great movies in the past and find this title begging to
be watched and replicated.Truly this movie deserves its ranking in the
top 250 movies and possibly one higher than 125. So put on an old
t-shirt, pop some corn, get back in that comfortable recliner and put
on this classic that will surely shoot to the top of your favorites
list.
