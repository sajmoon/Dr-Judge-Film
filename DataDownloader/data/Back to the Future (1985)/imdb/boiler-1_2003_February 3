This movie is great.  The script is perfect, there are an amazing number
of
details from the 1980's which track to the 1950's which make it a delight
to
watch more than once.  Michael J. Fox does a terrific job, this role was
made for him.  His family is a riot, with Christian Glover playing an
excellent nerdy father.  It is a combination comedy and science fiction.
It
also raises some questions about how simple acts in our everyday lives
can
have determine our destiny.
