Robert Zemeckis is one of the better directors out there, and you can say
what you want to about the movies he has done, but &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was
his most memorable. This movie was done with style, and will always be the
best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox)
and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a
wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his
voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea
Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare
occurance in science fiction. There are several things that I could note
telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has
never exactly done well in the theatres before, but &quot;Back to the Future&quot;
worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it
is
today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can
imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean
seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote
Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. &quot;If you're gonna
make a time machine, why not do it with some style?&quot; And that's exactly how
Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style.
