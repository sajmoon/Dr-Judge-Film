If you're looking for a movie with speed, humor, adventure, great (and loud)
music and good actors, try out Back to the Future. It's not only got
adventure in it, it's a beautiful love story as well, and the villain gets
to pay in the end.<br /><br />When you've seen the movie, you'll wish you were driving the time-machine
yourself.
