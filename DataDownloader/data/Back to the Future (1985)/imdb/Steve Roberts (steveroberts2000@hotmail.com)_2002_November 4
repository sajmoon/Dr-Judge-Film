Back to the Future is an absolutely superb film which i would reccomend
anyone to see. It is superb in all departments the acting and the storyline
being obviously the key bits but special effect and everything about this
film is great. Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F Wilson, Crispin
Glover and Lea Thompson are all superb. If you haven't seen this film,
firstly why not? and secondly you must do it as soon as possible!! An
absolutely superb film that will have you engrossed from start to finish and
wanting more (thats where part 2 and 3 come in) and to be honest with you, I
was still wanting more Back to the Future after part 3 (it being in my
opinion the greatest trilogy ever made). This is a great film and good for
all the family - a very clever story with great acting - just generally a
great film.
