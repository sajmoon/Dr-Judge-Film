This is the first, best, and most successful of the three BACK TO THE FUTURE
films. It points out that the future is something we make. It is not fated
or destined except by our own choices.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox steals the picture as the &quot;future boy&quot; who is both an Oedipal
love object for his own mother and a Cupid to get his parents together. The
story combines very creative imagination, romance, comedy, and drama in a
charming way and without sermonizing. This is a sweet and funny
delight.
