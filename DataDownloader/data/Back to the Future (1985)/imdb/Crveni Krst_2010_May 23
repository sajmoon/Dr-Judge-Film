I saw this movie 10 or maybe 15 years a go. Naturally I liked &#x22;Back To
The Future&#x22; as every kid did. So, after a decade and a half last week
I&#x27;ve decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.<br /><br />OK, let&#x27;s be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a
fictional comedy and you can&#x27;t expect any complexity or dramatic twist.
A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join
their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for
the 12-15 generation, but that&#x27;s as far as it goes. I still find it
entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the
excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is
insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all
shouts of sponsorship and it&#x27;s placed without any effort of subtleness.
It&#x27;s like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the
sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial.
Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that&#x27;s about it.<br /><br />And another thing. This is not SF!<br /><br />Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and
time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films
dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy,
fiction... &#x22;Back To The Future&#x22; is all those things, but SF it ain&#x27;t!
