This film is a Classic time travel film for when I first saw it as a
child, i've loved it ever since. This film is without a doubt the best
'Back to the future' film ever made. What makes this film different
from the other sequels is how it maintains its sense of fun and
excitement all the way through the film. What I mean, is that although
(Part 2 and 3) were good films, they didn't maintain its on-going
thrill like the first film did. All three films had a sequence in which
Martys mother/great-great grandmother had recovered Marty in either the
McFly home, Baines home or at Biff Tannens home at the casino hotel
until he woke up some hours later. In sequels 2 and 3 these films were
good up until those scenes and then went completely down-hill after. In
part 1, this film never went down-hill from beginning to end. The only
aspect of this film that I didn't understand that I'm sure many viewers
have noticed are the contradictions this film made (ie. Why
George/Loraine McFly didn't remember Marty in 1985, from 30 years
before - even though Doc Brown remembered him) which included even more
contradictions in parts 2 and 3. Also the scene when the Doc was trying
to send Marty back to 1985(via. The Clock tower) when the Doc was up
the Clock Tower connecting cables, for that scene completely
dragged-on. Other than this, this film was perfect in every way; The
acting was good (especially by Biff Tannen/Thomas Wilson) it had an
original storyline, perfect soundtrack, had great stuntwork and had a
good dialogue. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest you do, as it
suites viewers of all ages, classes and cultures.
