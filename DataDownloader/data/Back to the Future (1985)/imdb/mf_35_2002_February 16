i thought back to the future was a great film.
it had a plot, a great cast of characters,brilliant special effects and of
course the fabulous delorian automobil.
it had that catchy music and that great song 'power of love' so this made
the film even better.
there are are only a few films that i actually really enjoy but back to the
future comes no.1.
michael j.fox was great as marty, he was so cool.
christopher lloyd was briliant as the doc, he was mint.
and of course not forgetting the georgeous lea thompson as
lorain
thomas f.wilson as big bully biff and not forgetting finally
einstein,
docs time travelling canine.its an absolute cracker of a
movie.<br /><br />
