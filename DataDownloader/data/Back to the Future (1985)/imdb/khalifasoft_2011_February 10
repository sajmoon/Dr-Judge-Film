One of the best movies ever i have many dreams to make this movie come
true i wish to have time machine to change the future maybe i can make
it better place this movie have changed me i wish this movie to be re
predeceased in new graphic and new special effects or to be new series
who can imagine that boy can turn back in time and meet his mother or
be closed to marry her this is great seen when he helped his father to
marry his mother and when hiss uncle duck helped him to get enough
power to turn the car engine every body wont to get the same
opportunity to change the past to have better future and help his
family to have better life also the seen of his car broken and his
uncle get back with his flying train to show him that he have better
life and changed his own future this was amazing and really helped to
have better understanding of my future and make me know that today that
makes tomorrow and every day create your history
