Back to the future can only be described as a 1980&#39;s culture epic. This
seems to be the first of the director and writer Robert Zemeckis&#39;
bright idea&#39;s which seem to come along once a decade, other film&#39;s he&#39;s
noted for include the 2007 3D-Beowulf and Forest Gump.<br /><br />The whole film can be seen as nothing short of spectacular family fun.
A great treat for any kid or adult looking to have a nice time. Beyond
the wonderful mask the film wears though it has themes of bullying,
class, incest, love, and justice. All the while containing a perfectly
paced film that never lets you down. It may not be the worlds greatest
film ever made, though that is up to opinion. But could be seen as a
shining example of a good film. It&#39;s plot is relatively easy to
understand, but it never treats the audience as stupid.<br /><br />The acting isn&#39;t bad, (despite my hatred for Michael J fox: See
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqUo8RaJ23Q . This is how much I dislike
Michael J. Fox) and the film shows brilliant parallels between scenes,
all the while being an adventure with lovable characters, and an
insight to a world far from our own. With great music from the 80&#39;s,
including The power of love, by (see:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-hUkO13Fy8)Huey Lewis and the news,
memorable for other scenes in film history.<br /><br />Recommendations: Back to the future II &amp; III, Works of Stephen
Spielberg and Forest Gump. The magic 8-ball gives three thumbs up.
