It's not the best movie ever made, and E.T. is a better-made sci-fi, but
no
other film has combined laughs and thrills the way &quot;Back to the Future&quot;
has.
I don't want to tell too much of the storyline, (because if you haven't
seen
it yet, you really should) but it starts off with Marty McFly, a standard
'80's teenager (the setting is 1985) with a goofy, nerdy dad, an alcoholic
mom, a fast-food working older brother, and older sister who doesn't
really
do much at all. Marty's best friend is a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown
(&quot;Doc&quot;), who calls him and invites him to the mall parking lot at 1:15 in
the morning the next day. So he goes, and Doc reveals what he has in fact
spent the last 30 years inventing: a time machine. Unlike the past
versions
of what time machines would look like (generally a little room), Doc's
time
machine is in the form of a DeLorean (&quot;the way I see it, if you're gonna
build a time machine out of a car, why not do it with some style!&quot;). It
has
to go 88 MPH to work (along with a few other details I won't reveal now).
After a series of surprises, Marty finds himself transported back in time
to
the year 1955. Right after he gets there, he accidentally runs into his
parents (30 years younger; Marty's age now), and VERY accidentally,
interferes with the event of his parents falling in love for the first
time.
Not thinking much of it at the time, he goes around town, looking for the
one man who can help him: Doc Brown, 30 years younger. After he finds him,
Doc realizes that Marty's interfering with his parents' first meeting
could
have VERY bad consequences.
As I said, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is not the best movie ever made. However,
it
provides outstanding entertainment; the likes of which we haven't seen
since!
