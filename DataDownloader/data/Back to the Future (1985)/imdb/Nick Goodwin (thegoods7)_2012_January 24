This movie is magnificent. The directing and actor are superb.
originally director Robert Zemeckis had chosen Eric Stoltz to play the
part of Marty McFly and I think we&#x27;re all glad that he then chose
Michael J. Fox to play Marty instead. This movie really makes you pay
attention to detail and takes you into the realization that Marty is
hanging out with his parents when they were kids, and they play off
that whole not fitting in with the time with his clothes and making the
film funny by talking about him, his family, and the future. This movie
shows something that everyone wants to do in their lifetime, which is
time travel and this is a great way to show it. Back to the Future is
definitely a movie that will never get old and will always be
enjoyable.
