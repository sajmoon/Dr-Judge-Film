1999_August 6 

Well I was raised with Back to the Future, and will probally die with Back
to the Future. This has got to be one of the greatest films of all time, and
it just happens to come from the land of good films :the 80's. Michael J.
Fox and Christopher Loyd ignite this film on fire with superb acting and the
rest of the cast is great also. This is one of those films that can be
watched many times over, and even if you own it on video and it's on TV, you
still keep it on the channel. Spawning 2 sequels part2 and part3, the ladder
being the worst of all three but still good in it's own way, are a land mark
in our history just like the Godfather films have their own mark on movie
history. With parts 4 and 5 already in the works, it seems this bright
francise is only geeting brighter. a sure 10 out of 10.
