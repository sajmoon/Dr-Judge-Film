This movie was great! Michael J Fox is a great actor, and made this movie
what it is! I enjoyed the good plot, the acting, and the script. This is one
of Michael's best projects and Back To The Future is enjoyable for anyone of
any age. If you haven't seen this movie(I don't know anyone who actually
hasn't) watch it! You will be pleased. Back to the Future is
great!<br /><br />This movie deserves a 10/10... and if possible, I would give it
more!
Check this movie out.
