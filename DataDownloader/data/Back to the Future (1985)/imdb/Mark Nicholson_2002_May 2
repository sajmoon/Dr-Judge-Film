Back To The Future was the very first movie I saw at the Empire in
Leicester
Square, London, and will remain in my top ten films of all time for
eternity.  A feel good film, a film that made me want to go out and buy a
skateboard and learn how to play the guitar, emulating the crazed
performance of Marty McFly at the Enchanement Under The Sea
Dance!<br /><br />I have watched this film well over 100 times and each time I watch it I
get
those old memories flooding back to me.  The story itself is essentially
something that everyone would want to do - go back in time and change
their
present.  This film links the impossible to reality and makes your dreams
come true, if only for a couple of hours.<br /><br />You can relate to each character in the film at some point and you really
do
believe that these events, no matter how bizzare, have actually
happened.<br /><br />If you haven't watched it then you are either too young or you have been
living the past 17 years in a cave!  Go buy it, borrow it or steal it!
Just
watch it because you are missing a feel-good treat!<br /><br />
