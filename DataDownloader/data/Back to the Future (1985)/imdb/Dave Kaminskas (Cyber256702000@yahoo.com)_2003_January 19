17 year old Marty finds out his friend scientist Dr. Brown created a time
machine made out of a Delorian.  The machine runs on plutonium which Dr.
Brown stole from a group of Libians and he is caught and killed.  Marty
escapes by using the last of the plutonium and going back to 1955.  He
accidently runs into his parents and ruins all chances of his parents
getting together, which could erase Marty from existance.  Marty with the
help of the Doc Brown of 1955 must get his parents to get back together and
than find a way for him to get back to the future.  What a movie!  This is
just a fun flick that the whole family can enjoy.  Likeable characters that
are ALL played with amazing performances.  Great make-up, camera-work, and
sets.  The story is full of adventure and comedy.  Just a must see flick. 
**** out of ****
