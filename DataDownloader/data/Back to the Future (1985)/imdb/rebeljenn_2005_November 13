This is the film that started it all. Back to the Future is an original
film in which time travel meets comedy. The film is told well with
plenty of jokes. One of the best things about it is that it makes
science fiction look 'cool' and introduces that genre to a wider
audience who previously thought that science fiction was all about
geeks dressed up looking like Star Trek characters. There is a good
blend of comedy and action, and the general public was able to
appreciate it for the comedy and popular culture -- and for the 1950s
jokes and characters that we can identify with. If you haven't seen it,
this is a film that should not be missed. I am glad to see that it is
still popular.
