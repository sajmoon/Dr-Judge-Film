What can you say about the first Back To The Future film that hasn't been
said before?  This movie was one of the first I ever saw as a child, and
even now, it is still one of my favourite movies of all time.  Sure it
doesn't have the polished look that recent films have, but it doesn't
detract from the first class acting, and the thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi
adventure.
