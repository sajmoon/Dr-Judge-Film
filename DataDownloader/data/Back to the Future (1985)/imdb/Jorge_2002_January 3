The Back to the Future trilogy is definitely the best trilogy of all time,
hands down.  Michael J. Fox's (Marty McFly) best acting performance of
all-time.  Christopher Lloyd is brilliant once again, Thomas Wilson plays
a
great bully, and Lea Thompson was also excellent.  I am only a teenager
and
have seen the film at least 1,000 times.  This is one of those movies that
never get boring, the movie that you drop everything your doing to see it
once again, and one that can see with family, friends, or anyone!  I like
many other fans treasure this picture and will always treasure.  No other
trilogy will be even close to match it.  Not Jurassic Park, not Austin
Powers, not even Star Wars, NONE!!!  It is hands down the best film of the
80's and of all time.
