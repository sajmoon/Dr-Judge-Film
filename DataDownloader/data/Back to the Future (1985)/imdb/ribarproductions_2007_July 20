&quot;Back To The Future&quot; is one of 3 of my favorite movies of all times. I
have the Trilogy on DVD and I&#39;ve played the movie so many times, I know
all the dialog. I also have the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; Classic 39 on DVD as
well, so I couldn&#39;t help noticing one small error in the first &quot;Back To
The Future.&quot; <br /><br />As Marty sits at the dinner table on the Saturday evening of November
5th 1955, they&#39;re watching the Honeymooners episode, &quot;The Man From
Space.&quot; However, that episode didn&#39;t air until December 31st. of that
year. The actual episode that aired on November 5th 1955, was &quot;The
Sleepwalker.&quot; An episode which I think would have worked just as well.
I know,...Who Cares, right? Right!!!
