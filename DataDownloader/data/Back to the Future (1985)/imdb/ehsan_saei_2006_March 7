I am very confused because in the &quot;cast away&quot; Zemeckis have made a film
that believes in the destiny that is programmed by god but in this
movie the doctor have been survived after he had died because of the
notes from Marty and the destiny has been changed. what do you think
because of i had seen cast away before this , i expect in the meanwhile
of watching movie that the doctor will read the message of Marty in
1955 , but any way he will die because this is the destiny and i was so
confused after seeing the doctor alive . in the cast away Tom Hanks was
a on time man and because of an accident he casted away from civil and
he had a new believe that all things are not in his hands and someone
from &quot;up&quot; is programming for his life and at the end of film , when he
was in the road he was at a four way road and he did not know to go
from which way and the sight of camera was from &quot;up&quot; that seems
Zemeckis is showing us someone in &quot;up&quot;.<br /><br />do you think that the believes of Zemeckis have been changed or
something else?
