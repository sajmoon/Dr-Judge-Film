First, sorry for my spelling; I usually speak french! :P When Marty
goes back in 1885 in back to the future part 3, he damaged the gasoline
tank. They had to push the car with a train because they were out of
gas. But there was another solution! There were 2 dolorean in 1885. The
first one was the dolorean that Marty find in 1955 at the beginning of
the movie and that he push with the train to go back in 1985 at the end
of the movie. The second one was the dolorean that Doc have hided a few
days ago near the cemetery (The car that Marty find at the beginning of
the movie). Why they don't take the gas from this car?<br /><br />There would be no problem to make a continuation to this trilogy. Even
if the car in destroyed, Doc and Marty could travel the time with the
train (at the end of the part 3) and use the car as many time as they
want! These 3 movies are so good that they leave us wanting more, and
I'm sure that a continuation, even these days in 2005, would be as
popular then the 3 first movies.
