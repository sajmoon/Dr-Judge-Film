Wow, this movie had it all! It has an excellent comedic script, an
extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense
near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical
number and a romance subplot.<br /><br />In this classic comedy, Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a
17-year-old from Hill Valley, California. He is a friend with Dr. Emmet
Brown or &quot;Doc&quot; (Christopher Lloyd), a mad scientist who invented a
time-machine out of a DeLorean. When they are testing it out for the
first time, Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955. He bumps into
his teenage parents, before they are married, and by chance, his mother
starts to like Marty and wants to go out with him. He then meets up
with a younger Doc who helps him to try and make his parents fall in
love with each other or else Marty won&#39;t be born and have him go back
to 1985, the year he was originally from.<br /><br />The characters are excellent. I loved the character development and how
Marty made everyone change for the better. It put a smile to my face
seeing the impact that he had on everyone else. Marty and Doc have
excellent chemistry and everyone in it had an excellent performance. I
preferred Crispin Glover&#39;s performance as Marty&#39;s father, George McFly.
His total nerdiness just made me crack up when he spoke.<br /><br />The script is also one of my all-time favourite screenplays. The humor
is very clever and I loved the many one-liners. The plot is absolutely
brilliant. It was truly one-of-a-kind and it made me think deeply of
the concept of time travel and it kept me at the edge of my seat
throughout the movie. <br /><br />I cannot find a single flaw in this great feel-good movie. They
couldn&#39;t have made it better. Out of the hundreds of movies I&#39;ve seen,
this is the most fun I had watching a film.<br /><br />I rarely give out perfect scores but for Back to the Future, my rating
is a 10/10, I could not recommend it more. This a great movie to watch
if you want to have fun!
