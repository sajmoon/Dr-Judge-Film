I remember watching this film in 1986 and was just totally dumbstruck
this at the time was the best film I had ever seen and it seemed like
an eternity for parts 2 + 3 to come. This movie had everything comedy,
action, imagination and best of all a great plot which carried on
throughout parts 2 + 3 I would recommend this movie to anybody and by
just watching this you will see for yourself why you must see the
sequels. This movie rates in my top ten movies of all times, whilst the
trilogy of back to the future is second only to the Star Wars
Adventures. If anyone wants my opinion this will go down as one of the
greatest movies of all time of that I am sure don't delay its well
worth a look and is great for the whole family to enjoy.
