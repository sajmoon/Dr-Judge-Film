I was born in 1975, and if you happen to be around my age you surely
understand why I have to *love* this movie. Anytime I watch it I imagine,
if
they ever build a shrine for the 1980s there would have to be a big statue
of Marty McFly on a skateboard in it. Maybe you'll never find out what's so
good about this film if you happen to be 15 or 45 years old by now (though
I
think it's great family entertainment anyway). But for me and my friends,
watching this film means celebrating our own childhood. And that's why it's
10/10 for me.
