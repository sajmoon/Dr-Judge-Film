2000_September 5 

I first saw this film only a little while ago. (In fact, I went on the ride
before I saw the movie.)  I was immediately hooked.  I absolutely ADORE
this
film and think it is the coolest movie of the 80's.  Michael J. Fox gives a
stellar performance as Marty McFly.  Tom Wilson is Truly Evil as Biff
Tannen.  But the actor who stole my heart is Christopher Lloyd as the Doc.
I think he is SO CUTE!! Cripsin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Claudia Wells are
good too as (respectively)George McFly, Lorriane Baines, and Jennifer
Parker.
In conclusion, this was a Fabulous Film.  P.S. Chris, you're really
handsome; ).
