I love this movie! I saw it for the first time in like 15 years,
thinking that I&#39;ve seen it enough and put it off for that long. Then it
came on HBO and I was forced to watch it...I never realized how
unbelievably fantastically wonderfully awesome this movie is! It&#39;s so
funny and good and...just incredible! The story is just so well-thought
and cleverly put together. The acting is great, the sets are perfect,
heck I can&#39;t think of one bad thing to say about this film! It&#39;s going
to be a classic forever, there&#39;s no doubt about it. It&#39;s *fabulous*. ;)
Anyway, yeah. It&#39;s a really good movie. Best movie ever made in the
history of movies...deserves a trillion / 10 stars. Absolutely amazing.
Love it love it love it!
