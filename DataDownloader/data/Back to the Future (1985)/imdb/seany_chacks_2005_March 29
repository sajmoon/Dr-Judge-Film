There are certain films that you grow up with. You see them on TV all
the time and feel compelled to watch. I have seen Back To The Future
more times than i care to imagine. Each and every time i watch it, it
never fails to get me hooked straightaway. What is it about this film
that makes it endlessly watchable? The main character is a kid i wanted
to be. I even tried to copy his famous skateboard trick on a number of
occasions- each time managing to hurt my shin in the process. The film
centres around Marty Mcfly played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally
transported back in time to the year 1955 where he inadvertently
prevents his parents from falling in love-hence threatening his very
existence. It may sound complicated but the genius of the film is the
simplicity of the script. In short, Marty just wants to get back home.
To assist him in his quest is the man who helped him get there in the
first place (you still with me? good). Doc Brown is as eccentric as
they come but Christopher Lloyd makes him lovable with his great
performance. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and the afore
mentioned Lloyd is the key to the entire movie. It works a treat,
making the film come to life. Watching Marty and Doc struggle to put
their well thought out plan into action at the film&#x27;s climax is as
exciting as anything seen. The scale of this movie is not huge. It&#x27;s
not a big special effects film. Yes it does involve time travel and yes
it&#x27;s a big adventure. However, it&#x27;s the characters-not a big budget-
that make this film special. The score makes the film jump out of the
screen.. The Back To The Future main theme is one of the most
recognised in cinema. Only very special films tap into popular culture
and this movie sits proudly alongside the Star Wars&#x27; and Indiana
Jones&#x27;of this world.. The phrase &#x27;Back to The Future&#x27; will be with us
forever- just as this classic movie will be. &#x27;Roads? Where we&#x27;re going
we don&#x27;t need roads&#x27;
