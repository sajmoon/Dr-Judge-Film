This is what 80's was all about. Total feel-good movie that makes you both
laugh and gasp with excitement. Although I've seen &quot;Back to the future&quot; a
million times it hasn't lost its charm and I'm pretty sure it never will.
Purely as an adventure it's irresistible. The story is so unique, script is
absolutely marvelous and the acting (Christopher Lloyd in the role of his
life as Doctor Emmet Brown) leaves you speechless. I can't help of loving
Michael J. Fox, simply because he's such an extremely sympathetic and
unbelievably amiable bloke. He has to be one of the nicest guys of Hollywood
ever. If you haven't seen this huge classic you've missed something very
special. Check it out and don't forget the sequels either. The fact that
everything about this film is so ridiculous makes it even better. &quot;Back to
the future&quot; is a brilliant beginning to something that later became one of
the most extraordinary, enchanting and entertaining movie trilogies of all
times.
