Marty McFly, a guy with a girl, best friends with a crazy scientist,
who could ask for a better life? Marty is a lucky person outside of the
house. His friend, Doc (Doctor Emmett Brown), has told Marty that he
has succeeded in his latest experiment. Marty meets him late at night
and finds out that the Doc has made an actual time machine! Marty goes
back to the past, 30 years before, and accidentally meets his mom and
dad, 30 years younger. His dad, a Peeping Tom, his mom, a girl who has
nothing in her head but love dust, and the Doc, the same old nuts and
crazy. You can watch the rest. Back to the Future is a hilarious
classic that everybody will enjoy. It&#39;s fun, funny and also very, very
romantic that will leave you backing up on your seat. See this movie.
