IMDb Top 250: 70<br /><br />There are always decade-defining films. They may not be the best films
of the decade, but they capture the feel of living in them. Back to the
Future IS the 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s funny, charming, sweet, and completely
enjoyable. Dare, I say, it&#x27;s one of the most enjoyable films ever made.<br /><br />There had to be a point during the writing process when someone said,
&#x22;This is it.&#x22; The plot is movie magic. Teenager goes back in time to
save his future by fixing the past of his parents? Brilliant! And it
works so well because of the phenomenal, tightly written script. All
the little things are important and all tie together. It&#x27;s so cool to
see the same scene happen in two time periods, but the action is
exactly the same. Like the diner with Biff/ Marty&#x27;s house with Biff.
It&#x27;s laugh out loud funny, with plenty of period gags (Reagan, who the
hell is John F. Kennedy?), and sweet, with goodbyes and relationships
that clearly inspired modern film and TV (Lost Season 5?). The pacing
is perfect, with a constant sense of movement, and Zemeckis can weave
suspense whenever he wants, be it the first 88 mph or the super-tense
climax.<br /><br />In this cartoon world are cartoon characters, and Back to the Future is
filled with gems. Marty McFly, one of the most iconic teenagers,is pure
charisma. &#x22;That&#x27;s heavy stuff!&#x22; We wish we were Marty. He&#x27;s too cool.
Doc Brown, with his great phrases and even better facial expressions,
is just so dang lovable. And the first time I saw this, I completely
overlooked George McFly. He is hilarious. Brilliantly pathetic.<br /><br />It&#x27;s impossible to not like Back to the Future. Sometimes it crosses
the line into cheesy (NOOOOO!), the CG looks fake in some places, and
personally I don&#x27;t like the role reversal of George and Biff at the end
(he became what we hated in the beginning), but those are small things.
Back to the Future is one of the best 80&#x27;s movies, and has undeniable
charm. You have to see this one. 9.3/10
