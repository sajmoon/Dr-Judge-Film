This is one of my favorite films, one of the best constructed screenplays of
all time.  You can nit-pick the logic of traveling through time and not
&quot;space,&quot; where the placement of the earth itself would not be the same as
characters re-appear on the same (though transformed) street or property
left behind.
But the spirit of the film rises above logic with lines like, &quot;Don't worry,
Marty.  As long as you hit the wire with the lightening rod at precisely
eighty-eight miles per hour the instant the lighting strikes the tower. ..everything will be fine.&quot;
    If I have one wish as a film fan it is to see the footage of one-third
of the film that was shot with Eric Stoltz as Marty before Zemeckis and
Spielberg decided to re-shoot with the less serious Michael J. Fox.   If
anyone out there can campaign for this, PLEASE, let's not bury that
material, which is what DVD should be used for.  It's not like Stoltz'
career is hurting.
It would be educational to see the &quot;dramatic&quot; spin on the
character.
