One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film
blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I
went. Many year's latter, I bought &quot;Back to the Future&quot; at Mc Donalds
for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well,
and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes
science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the
script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many
problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about
their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently
casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see
the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the
movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters.
Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that
time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds
to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for
showing all 3 films.
