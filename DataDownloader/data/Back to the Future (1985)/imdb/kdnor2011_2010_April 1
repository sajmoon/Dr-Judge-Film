This, is a great movie, it&#x27;s perfect in nearly every way possible. It&#x27;s
a comedy, a science fiction, a high school movie, and an action movie,
what more could you ask for. 80&#x27;s movies were some of the best ever,
and this is, maybe not the best, but definitely in the top 5.<br /><br />Michel J. Fox stars as Marty Mcfly, a high school student who has no
perfect life. He doesn&#x27;t get his band gig, he constantly gets
detention, his uncles in prison, his mom&#x27;s an alcholic, and his dad&#x27;s a
nerd. He&#x27;s friends with a failed scientist named Doc Brown, who invents
a time machine.<br /><br />This lead to him going back to 1955, where only younger Doc Brown can
help him get back, but he also needs to get his parents together. How
it happened, I can&#x27;t explain, I swear, just watch it, it&#x27;s one of the
best movies of the 80&#x27;s and of all time.
