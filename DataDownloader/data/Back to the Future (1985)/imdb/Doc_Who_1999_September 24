1999_September 24 

This is one of my all time sci-fi comedies.It it one of the best of the
eighties along with the star wars movies.In the movie a young man is
accidently sent to the past of his parents ,because of this he has to
repair
the past so the future can saved.This movie also had two sequels made
after
it!!You can see huey lewis(of huey lewis and the news) as a parent/teacher
in the gym where mcfly is auditioning for a dance as band with his
friends!!look for billy zane in the 50's as a friend of the bad guy!!Maybe
one day it will come out on DVD?an awesome movie that everyone can
enjoy!!!also Lee Thompson(caroline and the city) is in the movie as the
mother of marty mcfly!!a good movie anytime it justs getting better and
better!!
