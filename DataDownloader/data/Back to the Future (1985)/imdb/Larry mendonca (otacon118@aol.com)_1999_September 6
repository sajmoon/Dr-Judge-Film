&quot;Hello McFly&quot;, weirdly enough is one of my favourite sayings.  This movie
is
just simply amazing.  Its one of my favourites.  The movie is extremely
underrated by film critics just because its a sci-fi.  Michael J. Fox
plays
Marty McFly, a teenager who accidently goes thirty years into the past in
a
time machine built by Dr. Emmitt Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  If you havent
seen this movie yet, your missing out on a legacy.
