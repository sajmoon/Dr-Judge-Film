Well, at this point in time, what more is there to say? When Back To
The Future first came out in 1985 I saw it three times at the cinema.
Back then it blew my mind and it still does. Great special effects, a
brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and great costumes. You couldn&#x27;t
imagine any other actors in this. Michael J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd,
Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson are all fantastic. Some
people tell me it looks dated now because of the 1980&#x27;s costumes. My
reply is &#x22;That means the 1950&#x27;s costumes must as well&#x22;. If you excuse
the pun, this movie is timeless. I&#x27;ve seen this dozens of times and
will continue to in the future. Steve Rice.
