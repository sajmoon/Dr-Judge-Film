My favorite movie.  I have never seen another movie like it or one that
comes close to the appeal of this one.  It is simply magical.  I saw this
movie when I was a kid and this movie demonstrates the art of motion
picture
at it's best.  I saw it three times in the theater and never got bored.
Superb performances by Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover,
Lea
Thompson, and Thomas F Wilson.  Great score by Alan Silvestri. Everything
about this movie is great and timeless! I hope they release this one back
in
theaters.  And if they do, &quot;When it hit theaters at 88 mph, you're going
to
see some serious fun&quot;!<br /><br />Rating: 10 out of 10
