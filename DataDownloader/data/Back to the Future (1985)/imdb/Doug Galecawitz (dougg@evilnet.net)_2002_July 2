If Sigmund Frued saw this movie he'd be foaming and frothing at the mouth
about it's  latent theme of having your mom wanting you in a sexual way.
Cokehead theories aside this is one of those movies that sums up the 80's
quite nicely. Between Micheal J Fox and Huey Luis and the News on the
soundtrack you can't get much more 80's. It's another movie like
Ghostbusters that you watch as a kid, then see as an adult and notice alot
of adult themed jokes you didn't even notice as jokes as a kid. &quot;I don't
wanna mess with no reefer addicts&quot; That line never did make sense when I was
ten.
