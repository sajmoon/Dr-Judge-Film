If you're looking for a movie that you can watch over and over and not
get tired of it, this is it. Teenager Marty McFly comes from a weird
family. His dad, George McFly, is a huge nerd who is always getting
pushed around by his boss Biff Tannon. His mom is a controlling,
hypocritical, burned out alcoholic. His brother is an air head that
works at Burger King and his sister is doomed to the same fate as her
mother so it seems. But Marty finds release in his lovely girlfriend
Jennifer and his wacky scientist friend Dr. Emmit L. Brown. Marty
dreams of making the big time with his band but is held back by the
criticism of others, his fear of rejection, and the short comings of
his family. But one day Doc Brown calls upon Marty to assist him in the
testing of his newest invention, a DeLorean converted into a time
machine. This movie is a fabulous adventure with good acting, special
FX, and humor. The characters are very well written and very likable.
This movie is brought to you by the first class director who is
credited with Forrest Gump and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit. This is a true
American classic movie that will be remember for many generations to
come. If you haven't seen it, if you like good movies, buy it. Believe
me it's worth it.
