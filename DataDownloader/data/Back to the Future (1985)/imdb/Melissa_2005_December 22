My favourite movie of all time, no matter how many times I watch it.
Classic, funny, and interesting, full of action all the way through.
And the sequels are good as well. A great movie for all ages, whether
you are young or old, a fan of science fiction movies, old movies, or
comedies. Something that never gets old. Not only is the plot great buy
Christopher Loyd is amazing in this movie. Hilarious and eccentric, he
is not easily forgotten. Marty is a classic teenager, with embarrassing
parents and a love of rock and roll. Doc Brown is an eccentric
scientist who has finally invented something that works, and along with
the rest of the cast, they make a wonderful movie that captures our
hearts and our minds.
