Now, I haven&#39;t actually seen this movie yet, but it sounds absolutely
amazing. I mean, a boy of the eighties traveling thirty years back in
time and meeting his parents as teenagers? FANTASTIC!!! What I wouldn&#39;t
give to travel through time at will! The whole &#39;Darth Vader from planet
Vulcan&#39; joke sounds pretty funny too. And two sequels?! Wow! And I
thought this movie was cool! It still is, but, you know? I would really
like to see this movie, so I will see if I can catch it on T.V. I would
definitely recommend this movie to Sci-Fi fans of any age. It has a
great plot, and some funny quotes, sounds like. I would say it is at
least worth a look.
