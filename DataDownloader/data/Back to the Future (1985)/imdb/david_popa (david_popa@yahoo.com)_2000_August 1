 This movie is completely amazing and fantastic. It has so much cool stuff
and action and suspence and drama and much more. It's that kind of movie
that you don't want to end. The script is good and original and the
direction is nice so it's a wonderful movie. It doesn't matter that it is
old from '85, it's still good . It's an imortal movie he survive 15 years
and he will live in the FUTURE !<br /><br />
