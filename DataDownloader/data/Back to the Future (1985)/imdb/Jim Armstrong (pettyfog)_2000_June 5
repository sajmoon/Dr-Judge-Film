This is NOT one of the greatest films ever made, but it will STAND THE TEST
OF TIME as &gt;&gt;one of the GREATEST MOVIES ever&lt;&lt;!<br /><br />This film should be part of any film school study as a perfect example on
how to make a successful commercial film.<br /><br />Premise: (familiar concept but original plot that appeals to the
imagination)
Production Values: (Clean cutting and pace without distraction, no
unnecessary SFX)
Direction: Let the Actors GO!
Casting: (Totally believe the characters, including typecasting eg; Lloyd,
Fox)
Script: Settings, set design, continuity, multi-level historical references
using ESTABLISHED pop-culture icons
Music, Soundtrack: Great selection.
Return on Post production publicity.<br /><br />Little appreciated career effects:
Fox and Lloyd were already celebrities, but this movie REALLY sprang Lea
Thompson's career.  She, more than any other cast member, had the greatest
range of character in the series.  She played 3 separate characters, I
believe.  She went on to several  different film roles as a result of her
classical theatrical performances, then Caroline in the
City.
Now (Spring, '00) she has been cast as a lead in a resuscitation of
&quot;Cabaret&quot; for the stage.  I can't help but think this role helped in her
selection based on her ability to project character.<br /><br />Overall, this will rank right up there with Breakfast Club as an example of
'80s ensemble flicks.  But, unlike B.C., will never be tiring to watch over
and over.
