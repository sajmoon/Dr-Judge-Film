There isn't enough good things I can say about this film.  Robert Zemeckis
is definitely one of the best directors out there.  The film has a great
story line from start to finish and does a great job of keeping you
interested in the characters.<br /><br />Usually movies that deal with time travel don't do a very good job of
keeping it feasible (cause time travel is such a bizarre subject), but this
movie has a quite feasible story (given that time travel is
possible).<br /><br />The special effects are also great, even for today's standards, they're very
good!  Well, I guess what I'm getting at is that if you haven't seen this
movie yet then you've missed out on greatness.  Please go see this movie! 
Thank you,<br /><br />-Chris
