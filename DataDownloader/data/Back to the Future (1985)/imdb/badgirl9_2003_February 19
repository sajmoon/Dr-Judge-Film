I can't believe I waited this long to watch the trilogy. I'm so glad I did.
This movie amazes me and makes me laugh every single time. This is truly a
classic. Michael J. Fox was riding high at this point in his life with the
popularity of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, this film at #1 on the box office and his &quot;Teen
Wolf&quot; at #2.    
The acting was great, the music and score were awesome. This is a great film
that deserves recognition as one of the greatest.
