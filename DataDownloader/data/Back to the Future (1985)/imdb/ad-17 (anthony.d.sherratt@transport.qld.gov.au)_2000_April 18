A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so
spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles
you leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler
searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself
threatens to erase.<br /><br />Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are
further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from
different angles, different perspectives and different timelines
abound.<br /><br />Fun for the entire family.
