1999_April 13 

There are few movies where I can't find any negative element in. This is one
of them.<br /><br />The basic idea of time-travel is of course not new, but never has it been
shown in such a wonderful manner. The puns (&quot;Get used to the bars, Joey&quot;),
the storyline and the extremely thrilling finale make this movie very
special.<br /><br />And of course we have brilliant actors who play absolutely lovable
characters. I am certain that I was not the only boy in puberty who would
have given everything to be as cool as Marty McFly...<br /><br />Though the sequels have not been bad as well, this movie is the ultimate
Science Fiction comedy of the 80s. It's a pity films like this or
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; are no longer made.
