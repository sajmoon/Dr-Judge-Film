   I agree with thefield: &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is clearly one of the<br /><br />greatest films of all time.  One of those where not only can't you<br /><br />imagine changing a single significant actor, but you can't imagine<br /><br />changing a single scene or (almost) a line of dialogue.  It also<br /><br />provides a good lesson about what science fiction should and<br /><br />shouldn't do, a lesson that its painful sequels fail.  The original<br /><br />was about the characters and the times.  The (absurdist)<br /><br />time-travel mechanism is a great frame, and it's inventiveness<br /><br />certainly contributes to the films &quot;masterpiece&quot; status.  But the<br /><br />sci-fi takes a back seat to the things we really care about: Marty<br /><br />adjusting to 1955, George's self esteem, Marty's relationship with<br /><br />Doc.  In the sequels, we get a whole lot of junk about the<br /><br />metaphysics of time (which as a philospher I instinctively pick<br /><br />apart), but all of the new characters feel like props, and I don't<br /><br />really care what happens to anyone.  This, far more than the<br /><br />&quot;Rocky&quot; series, is an example of sequels profaning an original.
