One of the best movies ever made in the history of film making. I know that
sounds like a little much, but they're just my honest feelings towards 'Back
to the Future'. I ADORE this movie for so many reasons, but I'll narrow them
down a bit here.<br /><br />For one thing, there's the many thoughts I've had about the possibility of
time travel. The whole subject appeals to me greatly because I'm a history
freak. But there's also the complications that would come with it, as this
movie points out. What if you stopped your parents from ever getting
together? Of course, you wouldn't be born, and thus not exist. The suspense
in this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering if Marty will
ever make it back.<br /><br />I also love the overall quality of this movie. The scenes that take place in
the '50s are so brilliantly done. There was no other movie like this back in
the '80s. That's why it was such a smash, and rightfully so. 'Back to the
Future' was a big part of my growing up, and still blows my mind to this
day.
