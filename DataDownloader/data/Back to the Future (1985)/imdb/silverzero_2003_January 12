17 years on since when it was released, Back To The Future still captures
the brilliance it did back in 1985.Though, to be honest, I am disappointed
that it is not in the top 100. Giving that films such as the highly
overrated and outdated Citizen Kane is no.6.<br /><br />It has a very simple plot (if you take out. the time travelling) and brings
about an excellent sense of nostalgia. The cast works perfectly together.
The soundtrack is very effective, from Mr. Sandman to The Power of Love.
Even the special effects are good for its day.<br /><br />Back to the Future still remains one of the best films ever made. 8.5 out of
10. (Marking films the way IMDb would).
