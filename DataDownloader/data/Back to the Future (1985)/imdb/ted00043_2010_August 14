3 REVIEWS IN 1<br /><br />BACK TO THE FUTURE was a little over-hyped but still admittedly the
best out of the series and well thought out but the jokes made me laugh
especially the Darth Vader one (it always cracks me up).<br /><br />BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 was flawed with the concept of Biff having a
grandson because Biff wanted for 30 years Marty&#x27;s Mother although we
aren&#x27;t introduced to the concept.<br /><br />BACK TO THE FUTURE 3 was supposed time-travelling to the 1880&#x27;s when
they get there it does nothing except try to live up to the other 2
although I am reminded of They Call Me Trinity.
