2003_January 1 

Just got to view the great DVD 3-pack release and I am amazed (as is
mentioned on a featurette) how well all 3 movies still stand up.<br /><br />Unlike so many movies from the mid-80's, the story is timeless, there is not
too much emphasis on fads at the time, the fashions etc are all very low
key.. which in hindsight is a bit of genius considering it may have been
tempting to show the 80's characters in the wild fashions of the time to
contrast with the 50's look.. <br /><br />And the future view also still stands up as being modern! Although, ahem,
flying cars by 2015? Doesn't seem so realistic now :) <br /><br />Anyway.. love them all.. the 2nd has that great futuristic look and
re-recreates the scenes from the original movie brilliantly! And though
originally I didn't like the idea of the 3rd movie being entirely set in the
west. I must say now of the three it's probably the most beautifully shot
with the warmest story..
