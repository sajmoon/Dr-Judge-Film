1998_August 5 

This is truly one of the greatest movies of all &quot;time.&quot;
Not only was it at one time up in the top 10 U.S. box office
hits when released, it was also nominated for an academy
award for best screenplay.  How many sci-fi/fantasy/comedy
movies ever get that?  Not many.  This is a film that will
live forever and become a classic.
