Well,this movie is supposed to be the starter for all time travel
movies,and it definitely fulfills all those requirements for a
thoroughly entertaining movie.The movie basically revolves around a 17
year old kid Marty Mcfly(Michael J Fox,in one of his best
performances)who accidentally steps into a time machine made by his
friend Dr.Emmett Brown ..who is a renowned scientist,under dire
circumstances.Marty goes back 30yrs back i.e;1955 as the movie is based
on the time of 1985.So,he faces several problems when encounters none
other than his own mother and father as students at that instant of
time.It is really fun watching Marty being the reason his mother and
father get together.I loved watching that part!!The rest of the movie
is how marty comes back to his own time,and unites his mother and
father as Marty becomes the reason for their enstrangement.A must watch
movie everyone.....it is great fun watching the whole thing.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed watching back to the future....it<br /><br />remains to be my favorite movie of all time!!
