POSITION ON MY TOP 100 (2001): #99.   Everyone's favourite sci-fi comedy,
Robert Zemeckis's Back To The Future still works well today.  Easily
Zemeckis's best film, it has a great cast (Michael J Fox and Christopher
Lloyd in the roles of the careers) and is still funny and exciting on the
50th viewing.  It is the best in the series (although the sequels are fun),
and can be enjoyed by people of all ages with a sense of humour.  The
script
is great and since the special effects never go over the top, they do not
look cheesy 15 years on.  Not to say that it hasn't dated, the clothes and
music sense is quite unintentionally funny, but this actually adds a little
to the film, as it is a film about the way fashion and attitudes change
over
time.  If you have somehow managed to miss this film, stop reading and go
buy it!<br /><br />90% - ***** (out of 5)
