Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are absolutely wonderful in this movie.
 Michael J. Fox plays a teen named Marty who goes back to the future in
Christopher Lloyd, who plays Doc, DeLorean time machine.  He happens to go
back to 1955, the year where his father, played by Crispin Glover, and his
mother, played by Lea Thompson, first met.  Something goes wrong and somehow
Marty alters time and possibly destroy his future life.<br /><br />Overall the acting was very cool and very good by all of the actors and
actresses.  The plot was solid, with no real flaws.  Rating 10 out of
10.
