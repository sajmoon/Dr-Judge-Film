Anybody who hates this movie probably hates babies and laughs at people
when they&#x27;re a few dollars short at the grocery store as they&#x27;re
picking through their groceries to see what they can put back until
they get a little more money. What else could be said to sell Back to
the Future in a review? It&#x27;s an 80s movie but it&#x27;s really timeless,
winding up as a 50s period piece as much as anything else. Flux
capacitor&#x27;s owe their success to Doc, and 88 miles as hour became
forever a part of American folklore. If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie you
need to. It&#x27;s not a piece of art, or a script with many layers of
emotional discovery, but it&#x27;s a fun movie and is something that can be
re-watched time and again. Rating 30/40
