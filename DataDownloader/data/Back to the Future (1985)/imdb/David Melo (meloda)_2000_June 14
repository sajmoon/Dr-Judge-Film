<br /><br />This movie is outstanding! I love the way Michael J Fox plays Marty McFly
and makes it seem so real. Going back to his parents years, and
interrupting
them from meeting, almost makes him history, but his hard work pays off.
Now
if he can only get back to 1985 safely! Great adventure, and exciting. I
highly recommend for anyone! Grade A+, and on a scale of 1-10,
10!
