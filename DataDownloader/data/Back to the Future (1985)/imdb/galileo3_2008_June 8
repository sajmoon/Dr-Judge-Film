Back To The Future (1985)<br /><br />Top 3 - 1985<br /><br />One of the greatest sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy/comedy films of all
time. I have seen very few other films that have provided the sheer
enjoyment that Back To the Future provides so effortlessly.<br /><br />The ultimate story: Using a time-machine, visiting famous times, seeing
life when your parents were your age and causing so space-time
continuum problems.<br /><br />Michael J Fox is superb as Marty McFly with equal if not greater praise
to Christopher Lloyd for his fantastic interpretation of Dr. Emmett
Brown, the mad scientist who made the De Lorean the car who is a time
machine.<br /><br />Verdict - An instant classic, bound to be loved for many, many years to
come.<br /><br />8.5/10
