Do you think this movie will be put back into theaters? I hope they put
it back out for an anniversary.<br /><br />Great flick, great freaking flick. This is an all-time classic. Where
is the spoof? Will they get Mr. Fox for one more time travel? I love
the Delorean. I will do anything for one of those cars! Say hi to your
mom for me...... Will anyone ever be this good? I hope that there is
never a re-make. I would travel back to 1977 and see myself born. Will
you see me or will there be a paradox. I want them to come out with a
new video game for the Wii. Who is with me on this? I also want to
challenge anyone in a trivia contest. Let&#39;s throw down!
