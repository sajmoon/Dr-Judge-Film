As of this date, the 3 &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films have these IMDb
ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes.
#3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is
the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.<br /><br />I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among
the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total
entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of &quot;time
travel.&quot; BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but
the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a
comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find
myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris
Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski (&quot;flower child&quot; spelled
backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael
J. Fox as Marty McFly &quot;defines&quot; a role as few have been defined in
films.<br /><br />The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is
what really makes them &quot;believable&quot; within the context of a pure
fantasy. Plus, although all the &quot;science&quot; in the 3 films is &quot;bad
science&quot;, which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't
overlook any details. They always offer a &quot;science&quot; explanation for
what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.<br /><br />Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like
the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different
part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few
weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think,
&quot;Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France,
drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory
turned home in the country.&quot; And you look around, you're back home to a
totally different world.<br /><br />That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw
Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885,
evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland,
fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the
past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is
back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end
of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.<br /><br />The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and
Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must
enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets
his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future
relationship of his &quot;parents.&quot; The old newspaper accounts of the
lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to
get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history
and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.<br /><br />#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for
&quot;future&quot; events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain
fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc
have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to
its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.<br /><br />In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually
written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the
future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty
not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and
historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So
Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. <br /><br />To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and
third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same.
The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of
&quot;discrepancies&quot;, but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are
just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's
nothing wrong with that.
