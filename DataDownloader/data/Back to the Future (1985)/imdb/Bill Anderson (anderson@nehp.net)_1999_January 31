1999_January 31 

I think some movies are perfect. By that I simply mean that given the
chance, I wouldn't change a frame. This is one of those movies. The
structure of the film is convoluted and full of surprises, but always easy
to follow. The first quarter or so of the film is all setup for gags to come
later. The viewer must be alert, because there's a payoff for virtually
everything that's said or done. This film demonstrates better than any
history book that as the decades pass, our understanding of the world
changes in ways we don't immediately comprehend. Watch as a 1955 character
demands a time traveler tell him who is President of the United States in
1985. His reaction, upon hearing it's Ronald Reagan, is priceless.
