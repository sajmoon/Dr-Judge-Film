2007_April 8 
One things certain,this is one of the greatest science fiction comedy
films ever. a true pleasure to watch from start to finish. I&#39;ve watched
many films like this and i must say this comes out on top, there are
very little flaws and it truly stood the test of time for its amazing
special effects. The acting was very impressive from both Michael j fox
and Christopher Lloyd. they both played there parts exceptionally well
and fitted their characters perfectly. The Music is also very good and
will be very memorable in film history. finally i have to say i cant
really point out any flaws and i find it hard to imagine that people
wont enjoy this film. A true classic for sure and one to look out for
if you haven&#39;t already seen.
