This is one of those movies (with the other 2 sequels) that never gets
boring.
I love the way it is filmed, with all the extra stuff in it which you only
notice when you've watched the movie multiple times.<br /><br />Great stuff, I'm looking forward to the other 2 movies which are
forthcoming! (part 4 and 5 that is)<br /><br />
