Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking
that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character
involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I
first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that
I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.<br /><br />One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you
think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the
story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is
delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so
much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel
discrepancies that may be found in the plot. <br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than
this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the
desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see
it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III.
