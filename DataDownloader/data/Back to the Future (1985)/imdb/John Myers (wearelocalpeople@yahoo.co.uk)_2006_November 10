Michael J Fox.....what an actor.this film had been around for ages
before i got to watch it,which was only 4 years ago on a DVD box set i
got for Christmas when i was 18.as soon as i got through the first film
i felt like this was the best film trilogy&#39;s i will ever watch.so i
watched them back to back and said to myself this is going to be my all
time favourite film trilogy.I&#39;ve never got bored even though I&#39;ve
watched the films tons of times.brilliant acting by all the cast and
superb parts of the film that will always be remembered.i couldn&#39;t
think of a better childhood film for all the family to watch.you fall
in love with it instantly.Hands up to Robert Zemekis and Steven
Spielberg on this one!
