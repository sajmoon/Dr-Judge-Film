Michael J. Fox in the role that made him famous as Marty, a college
kid, who is accidentally sent back in time into the 1950s with a time
machine invented by Christopher Lloyd, in probably his most famous role
as the odd professor.<br /><br />Stranded in the past, Marty has to find a way to return Back To The
Future, and make sure that he doesn&#39;t alter history in a way that might
actually change the time and place that he originally came from.<br /><br />Very well-structured, carefully thought-out mix of comedy and adventure
which plays its premise to the full, right up to an incredibly tense
and frantic finale.<br /><br />Excellent special effects and production design make this trip back in
time totally believable; a fine cast and sure-footed direction are
other essential highlights.<br /><br />First-rate escapist fare.<br /><br />A perfect 10 stars out of 10.
