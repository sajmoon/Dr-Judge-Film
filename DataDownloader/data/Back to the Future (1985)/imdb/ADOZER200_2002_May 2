This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did
outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc.
He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are
excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very
well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the
sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved
new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be
forgotten. There wont be one like it. Im surprised the delorium wasnt sold
out at the time. were they that badly made?
