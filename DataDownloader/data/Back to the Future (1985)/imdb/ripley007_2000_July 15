This is one of the first movies I saw when I was young. I got impressed by
the car (slow thing, the top speed is just 95 mph!), I enjoyed Michael J.
Fox' outstanding performances and I remember I screamed: 'Wow, men! Cool!'
when the DeLorean drove 88 mph and disappeared. Although it is getting old,
&quot;Back to the Future&quot; will never lose its attraction. The two other films
can't beat the feeling part 1 gave me. If you feel the need to see a REAL
GOOD movie, watch this one. I swear you won't regret. If you have  already
seen it, you'll understand why I love it.
