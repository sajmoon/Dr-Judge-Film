I just buy &quot;The Complete Trilogy&quot; DVD version of Back to the Future
this week. After listen the first movie I can say nothing change about
what I think of this movie.<br /><br />Just WONDERFUL! I listen this movie long time ago and liked it a lot.
And today I like the same. Even if we are in 2004. <br /><br />I give 9/10 for this movie. It's not cause it's so original but the
story is fun. Actor/actress are good. Music is cool. Image (DVD) is
very nice. Well ALL about this movie is great.<br /><br />Also I listen Original in French and I'M SO HAPPY the DVD version IS
THE SAME and not a idiot &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version (like for Blade
Runner - The Original is a Masterpiece, the Director's Cut is a idiot
thing). Just BRAVO for people who take the decision to NOT change
NOTHING of this Classical Movie.<br /><br />It's really Classical movie. And for people who don't see it (them)
it's a really good gift to give for Christmas.<br /><br />It's fun to listen a movie and be surprised. Again a very Great movie.
