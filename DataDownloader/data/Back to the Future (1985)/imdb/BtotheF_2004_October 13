The most well thought out and put together movie, no movies, ever
created. The characters are unforgettable and the plot is filled with
'edge of your seat' entertainment. Christopher Loyd is the perfect
crazy scientist that I have ever seen and no one else can play that
part. I am extremely happy they went with Michael J. Fox because the
first guy just didn't fit Marty like he does. The &quot;Delorean&reg;&quot; fit the
time look perfect to. The effect of getting to see your parents young
was a charming experience, But no matter what Doc. Brown stayed the
same. The movie was made with real craftsmanship and it turned out
almost perfect. I gave this movie a ten. A great movie for everyone.
