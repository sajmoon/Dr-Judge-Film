This movie is simply disgusting. I must have seen it about 50 times and
each time I see it I get more and more disgusted. What is this thing?
Each actor is playing perfectly, while you just have to look for one
second at DcBrown's face to start laughing. The plot is so impressive
that I can't get bored in a single scene, and the worst thing of all is
suspense: It's chemically made(prepared with peaceful scenes to begin
in action scenes) to make you feel real suspense, being unable to
predict what is going to follow, and with a music casing that makes
things about 6 times worse.<br /><br />In addition, it contains contradictory material: It's both classic AND
innovation. How can you make an impressive, suspenseful action scene
with a skateboard run without making something completely stupid? Ask
those who wrote &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Besides that, the whole movie is
completely according to reality, with just a small add-in: The time
machine. And, finally, it's rated PG. A theme that would be expected to
be rated-R for other scriptwriters, in this film it's made in a moral,
family, let's say, way. Not a single bloody drop of bloody blood. All
wickedness and sexual abnormality belongs to the bad guy. This must be
the most disgustingly good film I have ever seen.
