The movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) and the sequals &quot;Back to the Future
II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Back to the Future III&quot; (1990) is the best trilogy ever
made. Yeah, even better than Lord of the Rings, in my opiniun. I was very
pleased to see that this movie was at the top 250. I cant wait to the DVD
Release December 17th 2002!<br /><br />RedSlicer&lt;--- -
