This is a classic! Michael J. Fox travels back in time and, by accident, the
then teenage girl who will become his Mom falls for him. This can't happen,
since it would prevent his parents from falling in love and that means he'll
never be born. There are many humorous twists in the plot. Towards the end,
Fox stands in with the band at a school dance and shows that he can play a
guitar! His music turns out to be a little too 80's for the crowd but he's
GOOD! I like this movie!
