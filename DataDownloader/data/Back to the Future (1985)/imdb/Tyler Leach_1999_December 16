This film will capture the minds of children for years to come.<br /><br />I don't think Time Travel could be portrayed any better. Watch this one
because of the actors, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, the captivity,
and
the special effects. If you like Back to the Future 1 then you will be sure
to see Back to the Future 2 and 3, featuring more time travel and special
effects.
