I own all three Back to the Future movies. I found that the first was
classic, and quite easy to follow compared to the second. The second
wasn't hard to follow, but it took a little thinking. I personally like
the casting and plot of this movie. The idea for using a DeLorean as a
time machine is brilliant. I like other films from the 80s, like Lethal
Weapon, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Return of the Jedi,
but by far, Back to the Future is superior. I recommend this movie to
anyone who enjoys a good comedy or adventure. Marty is probably my
favourite character, followed by Doc. If you are to watch the first
Back to the Future, I HIGHLY recommend watching the other two.
