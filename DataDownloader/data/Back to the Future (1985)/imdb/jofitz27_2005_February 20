2005_February 20 
Me and a friend watched this on T.V. recently for about half an hour
and didn't really think much of it, so we watched something else. I got
some reviews (and I know it was more of a landmark when it first came
out) so I watched it again. It was getting a perfect '10' everywhere I
went. <br /><br />So just yesterday I watched the whole thing again, and enjoyed it a lot
more. It was more funny, more entertaining, and plain better. Maybe I
hadn't been in the mood for it the first time. But I was now and it was
good; mixing cheeky humour with action and tension: sure it's a good
film. But nowhere near perfect. I know this may seem hard to take in,
but this is how it is: there is nothing particularly wrong with this
picture, it just isn't amazing. That is the whole truth, up front, pure
and simple. 8. <br /><br />Final Analysis: 8 out of 10
