I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which
I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The
special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and
sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty
ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes
fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time
travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a
greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever
in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis&#x27;s
direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes
are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is
really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled
him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most
memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger
Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover
are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways.
