I think I have seen this movie quite a few times and every time I like it
more and puts me in a good mood.<br /><br />It is aestethically beautiful, wonderfully directed and the plot is very
good and makes me positive.<br /><br />The thoughts about traveling in time, changin' events or seeing the world
30
years ago are fascinating and Zemeckis well knows how to render
those.<br /><br />Lastly this movie makes me think that in life there is actually a future
and
we can do something about it.<br /><br />This movie is also very much fun and has a very good rhythm... what can I
say? I think this movie is fantastic!<br /><br />Marco
