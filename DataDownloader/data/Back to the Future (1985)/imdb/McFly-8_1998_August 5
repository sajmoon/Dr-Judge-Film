I am one of the biggest Back to the Future fans in the world.  I can't say
 that I am the biggest though because there are so many out there.  This is
 why we NEED a Back to the Future 4.
Michael J. Fox has got Spin City and everything and he's wishing that the
 BTTF hype would just quiet down.  But take it from me, if it hasn't quieted
 down by now, 13 years since the original came out, it isn't ever going to
 quiet down.  Robert Zemeckis needs to get the ball rolling and make this
 movie.  Do it for the millions of fans out there that refuse to believe
 your going to end the greatest series of all time with Doc flying off in a
 train.  Michael, Lea, and Christopher may think they're getting too old for
 another sequel.  But I say that your never to old when you've got a time
 machine.
