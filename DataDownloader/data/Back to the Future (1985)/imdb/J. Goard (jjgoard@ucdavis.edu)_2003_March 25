&quot;Back to the Future&quot; is clearly one of the greatest films of all time. One
of those where not only can't you imagine changing a single significant
actor, but you can't imagine changing a single scene or (almost) a line of
dialogue. It also provides a good lesson about what science fiction should
and shouldn't do, a lesson that its painful sequels fail. The original is
about the characters and the times. The (absurdist) time-travel mechanism is
a memorable device, and its inventiveness certainly contributes to the
film's greatness. But the sci-fi takes a back seat to the things we really
care about: Marty adjusting to 1955, George's self esteem, Marty's
relationship with Doc. In the sequels, we get a whole lot of junk about the
metaphysics of time (which as a philosopher I instinctively pick apart), but
all of the new characters feel like props, and I don't really care what
happens to anyone.  This is a classic example of sequels profaning an
original.  &quot;Part I&quot;: 10/10.  II and III, 3/10.
