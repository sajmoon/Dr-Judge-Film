1999_April 3 

Yep, I have to say that this is a great movie. Watchable is the most
appropriate word I think because it is just so watchable! The plot is
handled excellently making full use of the paradoxes that time travel
normally throws up. Performances are very well done and the whole thing
moves along flawlessly. As worth watching today as it was when it first
hit
the screens. Downsides? Just the scary 80s fashions!
