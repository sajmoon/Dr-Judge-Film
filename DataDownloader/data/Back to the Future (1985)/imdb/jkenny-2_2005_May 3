I don't really see this movie as science fiction at all. Science
fantasy, maybe. How does this time machine work? Marty asks. Well it's
the good old flux capacitor, Dr. Brown &quot;explains.&quot; In the original
&quot;Time Machine&quot; movie, scientific explanations are even lamer. How does
it work? Push the lever forward you go into the future; push it back
and you go into the past! Why, thank you! It's perfectly clear now. No,
no. There is no real science in &quot;Back to the Future.&quot; The technological
premise is a mere excuse to ruminate on the vicissitudes of fate and
the possibility of doing something very difficult but crucial: changing
your history. Marty learns that, maybe--just maybe--if you go beyond
yourself and do something beyond what you think you can, beyond what
you have seemingly been set up by fate to do, then you can change
history--fate--not only for your self but for others as well, for your
progeny, your family. Thus the real hero of this morality tale is not
Marty but the old man. With Marty's help, he eventually stands up to
Biff, something he never did the first time around and everything
changes! The family is now hip and smart, classy, loving and cool! When
I first saw that last scene (and when I still see it today), a tear of
humanistic joy comes to my eye. The whole family is redeemed for at
least a generation, because George learns a Hemingway lesson: a coward
dies a thousand deaths, but a brave man only one. If Biff had killed
him in the parking lot, then, at least, it would have been &quot;The Short,
Happy Life of George McFly.&quot; Sweet, sweet, sweet redemption. I love it!
