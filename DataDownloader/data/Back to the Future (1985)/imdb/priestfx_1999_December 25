1999_December 25 

This movie is really stuffed with all kinds of adventure themes and the
usual social &quot;issues&quot; (i.e. confrontation of fear)... It still makes a
decent sci-fi adventure. The story is big and interesting, the movie is
fast-paced (it speeds even through its more meaningful dialogues).There are
some nice special effects, most of the action is original (in a movie, I
suppose), and it has one of the most interesting adaptations of the idea of
time travel. All the characters are depicted colorfully, without any
useless
or &quot;empty&quot; ones (for example - the Planet of the Apes' second astronaut,
the
one whose brain is modified, is only there to give the main hero [the first
astronaut] another reason to dislike the Apes). Christopher Lloyd gives his
best and characteristic performance here (although I haven't seen many
movies where he stars or co-stars). Michael J. Fox gives one of his best
performances here, as good as the one in &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;...
Overall &quot;Back to the Future&quot; a very good movie...
