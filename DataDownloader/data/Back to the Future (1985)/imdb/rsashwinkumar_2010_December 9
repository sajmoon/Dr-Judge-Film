2010_December 9 
After watching a horrible movie (I don&#x27;t like to mention the name of
that movie!), i saw (or enjoyed to be exact) this flick, and it
completely changed my mood. It made me laugh and sustained the laughter
throughout the film. Further, it made me watch the other two sequels,
consecutively, and i completely enjoyed all the three parts!<br /><br />The storyline is bizarre and different, and it gives enough room for
the humor quotient to fill in. Writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemicks,
have made sure that the film goes on at a brisk pace. The entire film
makes u laugh, and enjoy thoroughly. <br /><br />Speaking about the performances, Michael J. Fox, fits into the
character of Marty like a &#x27;t&#x27;. His perplexed expressions are quite
funny to watch, and tickles u. His confused looks, especially in the
scene where his mother (in 1955), is about to fall in love for him, and
the way he tries to dodge and escape her, deserve special mention.
Christopher Lloyd is the man to watch out for; it is his body-language
and performance which contribute to the humor factor mostly. His
dialog-delivery, body- language, looks and expressions are sure to make
you laugh!<br /><br />The Background score by Alen Silvestri, is pretty apt, and especially
in the climax scene, his background score maintains the pace of the
film and keeps you engaging. <br /><br />In a nut-shell, if you seek for complete enjoyment, and want to ache
your own stomach, laughing, then Back to the future, is the one to go
for!!!
