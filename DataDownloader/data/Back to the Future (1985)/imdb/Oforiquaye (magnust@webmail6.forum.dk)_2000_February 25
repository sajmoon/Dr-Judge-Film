This movie is the greatest i've ever seen. I've always loved movies about
timetravel, and this trilogy is simply the best i've seen. The movie is
very
intelligent, with an outstanding sense of details. The actors are all
brilliant. The only disappointment is that Crispin Glover refused to be in
the sequels. All three movies are great, but I like BTTF II
the
most.
