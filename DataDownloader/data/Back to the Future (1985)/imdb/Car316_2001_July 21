Back to the Future is grand entertainment from start to finish. It's full of
relentlessly clever ideas, funny, charming characters, endlessly quotable
dialogue and suspense. As fun as it is, it's the human aspect that makes the
movie so special. All the performances are great, and Christopher Lloyd is
unforgettable as Doc. The sequels are good, but they don't come close to
this movie. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. **** (out of
four)
