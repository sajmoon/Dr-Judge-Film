2000_December 8 

I have seen this film dozens of times, and I always end up watching it from
its beginning until its end without a single eye flick. This film is
absolutely marvelous, and Michael J. Fox is perfect for the role he plays.
There aren't many films which don't let you get up from your seat until the
credits are scrolling, and this is one of them. It's incredibly funny and
entertaining, so much that it creates addiction.<br /><br />My conclusion is that this film is nothing but a work of art. Although it's
in a key of comedy, it reaches the excellence necessary to be a masterpiece.
It's very difficult for a comedy to reach that point. The Odd Couple and The
Sting are another two examples.<br /><br />My rating: 10 out of 10.
