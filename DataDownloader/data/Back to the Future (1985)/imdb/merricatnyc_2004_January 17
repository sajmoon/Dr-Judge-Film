BttF is a nice enough movie if you a) fell in love with it as a pre-teen, b)
currently are a pre-teen, or c) are the parent of a pre-teen. Otherwise, it
gets a tad annoying. Marty's continual, idiotic 'slip-ups' with 1985
references in 1955 give me a headache and make me wonder if he's not
mentally defective. Pepsi Free? Was that on earth either before or after a
couple of months in 1985?<br /><br />That said, Crispin Glover should have gotten an Oscar for his performance as
Marty's dad George. He takes the generic nerd written in the script, chops
it into kindling, and uses it to set the screen on fire. With his
incomparable gift for communicating character through body attitude, CHG
transforms the one dimensional creature of the dialogue into an entirely
mesmerizing cinematic force. Well worth slogging through the rest of this
flick for his performance.
