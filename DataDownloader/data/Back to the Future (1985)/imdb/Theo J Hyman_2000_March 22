This movie could be seen a thousand times, and in fifty years, I'll still
love it as much as the first time. The best movie of the eighties and
perhaps, the most entertaining movie ever made.
What makes this movie is the incredibly funny script, an ingenious story
and
excellent performances by the entire cast. Without doubt, a classic, that
will always be remembered and looked back on, even in a hundred years
time.
This is Robert Zemeckis' best movie, with huge thanks to Spielberg as
well.
By far the best of the trilogy, although II and III are both great (100 %
for I, 85 % for II, and 90 % for III).
