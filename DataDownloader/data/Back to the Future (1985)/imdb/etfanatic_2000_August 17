Back to the future is one of my favorite movies. Michael J. Fox IS Marty
McFly. The movie has a really cool plot behind it. I wish I knew the Doc
and
was able to go with him in the DeLorean. I can watch this movie over and
over again without getting bored. It's just one of those kind of movies.
I'd
recommend it to anyone that wants to see a great show!
