BTTF is a magical film that can be watched again and again and never
tires. I first saw it when I was about 10 years old and it became an
instant personal favourite, somewhat due to the fact that the &quot;future&quot;
coincided with my own year of birth.<br /><br />Conceived by the highly talented duo of Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis
(the two Bob&#39;s), it tells the story of a 1980s teenager who is
accidentally transported back in time to the 1950s in a
plutonium-powered DeLorean created by an oddball scientist. His brief
trip back in time turns into a nightmare after he inadvertently
prevents his parents from meeting and subsequently jeopardises his own
existence. Working with the 1950s counterpart of the scientist who
created the time-machine, he must find a way to make his parents fall
in love and get back to the future.<br /><br />On the surface, the story seems rather simple and straightforward, but
if you look deeper, you will find that this film has many complex
layers, which make it an utterly brilliant piece of work.<br /><br />It is also full of coincidences. For instance, our time-travelling
hero, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955, with the
latter been exactly 30 years in the past. There are countless other
coincidences that are scattered throughout the film, many of which can
be picked up after repeat viewings. Picking up and identifying new
things can be quite fun.<br /><br />Get lost in time and enjoy the film!
