Back to the Future is probably one of the best motion pictures I&#39;ve
ever seen. I love the way time travel is somehow made real to me! The
average time travel movie is surreal but, in this case, because of the
way the story is told, I find it pretty real. One can almost start
believing in time travel and all! <br /><br />I really enjoyed Marty McFly performing one of the (in my opinion...)
best songs in human history, Johnny B. Goode. The dance is great, and
the comment afterwards: &quot;I guess you guys aren&#39;t ready for that yet.
But your kids are gonna love it.&quot; <br /><br />It is great to see Marty starting to understand his parents&#39; choices
better by knowing them as teenagers. It is always funny to see him make
mistakes though: &quot;Dad&quot; becomes &quot;Dad, dad, daddy-o&quot;, and so on.<br /><br />That&#39;s pretty much everything I have to say about Back to the Future...
