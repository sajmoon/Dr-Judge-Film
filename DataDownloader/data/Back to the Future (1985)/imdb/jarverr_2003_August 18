Marty McFly hops into his late scientist friend's time machine and
accidentally transports himself into the past 1955. In the past, he
reacquaints with a much younger Doc Brown and some other familiar people
that he never did expect to meet. But there's a catch, to get back to the
future Marty must accomplish some tasks that have something to do with the
disruption of time and space and those things are where his chances depend
on getting back. It's amazing at how tightly structured this story is, and
how there were 360 degree arcs for all the characters. All the changes
pretty much came from them without having to sacrifice any aspect of this
wonderful film's storytelling. It's perfect, flawless and highly
entertaining. I especially love the opening sequence done to THE POWER OF
LOVE. Just cool. 5 out of 5.
