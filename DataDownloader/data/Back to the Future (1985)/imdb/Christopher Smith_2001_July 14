BACK TO THE FUTURE is probably the best movie of the 1980's. It is also
probably one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. It has been one of my
favorite movie since I first saw it a few years ago on television. I have
seen it many other times on television since then, but I enjoyed it the most
the first time I saw it.
