This movie is excellent for children and adults of all ages. I would
highly recommend this film for any family that have children of any age
group.<br /><br />Michael J.(Andrew)Fox was an excellent choice for &#39;Marty&#39; and
Christopher Lloyd was excellent for &#39;Doc&#39;. Good job guys. I definitely
give this movie a 10 and put it in my top five favorite movies.<br /><br />If I could go back in time I would Like to Know how my mom and dad
really met. I would go back to the old west and trace some family
branches down. Mr.Zemickis did an outstanding job as did Mr. Gale and
Producer Neil Canton, good job guys.
