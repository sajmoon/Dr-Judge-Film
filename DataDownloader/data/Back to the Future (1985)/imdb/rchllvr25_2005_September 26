I tended to like the movies as they appeared. I was at an age with the
first one came out that I understood it well and will always believe
it's even one of my favorite movies of all time. Had a wonderful crush
on Marty, even Biff (but I won't admit it aloud), always though
Lorraine was beautiful, but a little strange and thought her attraction
to Marty was a typical plot twist, but oh so humorous. Part II was
great too, not as good as the first, but the way it seemed so
believable and the ideas they came up with, were superb. Part III, I've
probably seen about ten times, it's watchable, but halfway likable.<br /><br />What are your opinions??? Francesca &quot; Radiation suit? Of course,
