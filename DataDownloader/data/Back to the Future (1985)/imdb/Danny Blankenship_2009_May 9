Since first seeing this classic in 1985 and thru the years from premium
cable, TV network, video, DVD, and cable showings &#x22;Back to the Future&#x22;
has always been an enjoyable film. I&#x27;ve saw it enough many times and
whether it be with family or by myself I still enjoy. Clearly the film
is well liked for it&#x27;s theme even though time travel is fantasy, still
when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects &#x22;Back to
the Future&#x22; is without a doubt a memorable classic.<br /><br />Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special
effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the
most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even
though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to
all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy.
1980&#x27;s TV star Michael J. Fox(&#x22;Family Ties&#x22;)stars as teen Marty McFly a
down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who&#x27;s
only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music
and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr.
Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as
Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly
this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering
chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized
future.<br /><br />Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty&#x27;s
parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound
as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his
important past, because that is his critical future that he must
protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to
force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high
school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.<br /><br />Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and
interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you
would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be
great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing
with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and
risky. Still &#x22;Back to the Future&#x22; is now an immortalized pop culture
film classic coming along in a time the mid 80&#x27;s that showcased and
interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment
thirst. As it was such a memorable and well liked film for showing that
it would be nice and such a dream for anyone to go back and see
important things in their past while in the meantime it&#x27;s such a good
feel to be able to shape things in your past that lead to a happy
future just like Marty&#x27;s character did in the film. The adventure and
action special effects blend in well with the fantasy theme to make
&#x22;Back to the Future&#x22; a film that&#x27;s unforgettable, memorable and one
that will certainly stand the test of time!
