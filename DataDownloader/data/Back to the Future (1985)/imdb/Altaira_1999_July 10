1999_July 10 

Ohhhh...such a great film, even after so many years!  I first saw Back to
the Future as a seven-year-old, and while I enjoyed it then, I didn't
grasp
all the subtle implications.  The idea of a teenager accidentally mucking
around in his parent's first romance is mind-boggling, but enjoyable.  In
some ways, this is not only a sci-fi flick (which really it isn't) but a
character drama, a comedy (at many times) and a period piece.  The
contrast
between the 80's and the 50's is comical in a time when both decades are
part of America's colorful past.
After you've seen Back to the Future at least a dozen times, you start to
pick up on the attention to detail--and how one incident in the past can
drastically affect the future.  The name of the mall, for instance, is
changed from Twin Pine to Lone Pine in one fell swoop of an out-of-control
DeLorean.
Such comedy arises from Marty's encounters with his family-to-be.
Lorraine,
his mother, is infatuated with him, much to the dismay of her family; her
father remarks, &quot;He's an idiot.  Parents probably idiots too.  Lorraine,
if
you ever have a kid like that I'll disown you.&quot;  If he only
knew!!!<br /><br />BTTF also sets the pace for the rest of the trilogy, and you really have
to
watch the first to understand any of the movies.  Plus, if you look at the
trilogy as a whole, one big incorporate story, it's really a very
inventive,
involving joyride.  Plus, Christopher Lloyd makes a very amusing nutty
professor-type, and the soundtrack's great.  The costumes are convincing,
as
is 50's Hill Valley.  A great experience for anyone.
