British paper The Guardian published few years ago a list of the 10
best Sci-Fi movies ever according to the opinion of scientists. I do
agree with the ones who handed the prize over Blade Runner after a good
bundle of titles were cast out in quite a sensitive selection. However,
while scrolling down on the honor list I did not find Back to the
Future included (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were there
nonetheless and in my very humble opinion both films are space-epic
rather than genetically pure Sci-Fi).<br /><br />Back to the Future can be considered a typical yet serious Sci-Fi
movie: all of the main aspects regarding time traveling, such as how
the time machine&#39;s engine is put to work or how these kinds of trip
generate time-space paradoxes, are present and clearly enough
explained. This movie&#39;s progression was as well very carefully and
dynamically put into sequence. Back to the Future is a classic for
those who were teenagers (and the not so young ones of that time) when
it was first released. Emmet Brown is arguably one of the most
remarkable mad scientists ever created (by the way, mad scientists are
another main topic in Sci-Fi) and I never tire of watching its re-runs
over and over again, anytime.<br /><br />Well, perhaps it&#39;s just me, being not an important scientist but a
picky moviegoer. I hope this works as a recognition of MY own. Back to
the Future will keep rocking yet far beyond the few years to come.
