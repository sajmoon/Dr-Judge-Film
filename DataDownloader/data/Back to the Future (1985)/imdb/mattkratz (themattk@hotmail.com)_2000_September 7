Here is an excellent movie.
This benefits from a tricky subject (time travel), great characters, and
good acting. For those of us who have ever wanted to go back in time and
change something or strike back at our tormentors or who just want to WATCH
A MOVIE, this is for you.
Michael J. Fox travels back 30 years and accidentally interferes with his
parents' initial meeting. He then needs to fix it in a week or before he
disappears from existence-whichever comes first.
Christopher Lloyd is terrific as the mad scientist. Everyone else is fine
too.
