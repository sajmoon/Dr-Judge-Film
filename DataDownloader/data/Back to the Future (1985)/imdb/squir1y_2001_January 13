I have to say that a million great movies came out of the 80's. But Back to
the Future has to be within the top ten and at least in the top 20 of the
most fun movies.<br /><br />Doc Brown has invented a time machine(out of a DeLorean)and Marty McFly has
accidentally been transported to 1955. He also screws up his parents first
meeting. So he has to figure out a way to get his parents back together and
get back to the future.<br /><br />This movie has a load of memorable scenes such as the skateboard chase
through Hill Valley and an awesome scene is when Marty plays Johnny B. Goode
on stage at his parent's dance. I also liked the scene when Marty's dad
knocks out his nemesis Biff. The scene with the lightning bolt and the clock
tower was suspenseful when I first saw it.<br /><br />A very cool movie. 10/10
