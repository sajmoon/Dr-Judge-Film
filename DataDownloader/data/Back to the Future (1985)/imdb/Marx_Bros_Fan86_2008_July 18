The majority of 80&#x27;s comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all
necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80&#x27;s feel. This is not as
much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large
part of it does not take place in the 80&#x27;s! Although it does have more
of an 80&#x27;s feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be
enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a
wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works
on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to
create a perfect 1950&#x27;s atmosphere, with great sets, 50&#x27;s music, and
50&#x27;s television shows.<br /><br />Marty McFly&#x27;s (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher
Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for
its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and
accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering
his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to
repair the time machine and get his parents together before he
literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the
bully who controls George McFly&#x27;s life, interferes with Marty&#x27;s plans
at every turn.<br /><br />The relationships between these characters really elevate this film
above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always
a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the
nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes,
Marty&#x27;s mother. Marty&#x27;s scenes with his parents remind us that our
parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in
common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his
father and his mother&#x27;s rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on
Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson&#x27;s charm and Fox&#x27;s
awkwardness make it hilarious.<br /><br />I should devote some credit to the film&#x27;s special effects and action
scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness
the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux
capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean
at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting
scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri&#x27;s
score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a
significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine
going back in time is just as impressive today.<br /><br />Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt
he will top it.
