Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I
always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to
entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it
recently and couldn&#x27;t remember most of it. That being said I was right
in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.<br /><br />This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing.
Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is
a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and
hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his
boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down
poor jobs and aren&#x27;t particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to
spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an
experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and
needs Marty&#x27;s help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc&#x27;s
latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty&#x27;s shock and
amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists
barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into
the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting
thirty years into the past.<br /><br />Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally
prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually
cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on
finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way
to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.<br /><br />The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is
just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is
going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past
constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen.
Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose,
except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All
tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge
relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters
in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and
there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing,
and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.<br /><br />The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all
will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to
be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher
Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for
him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable
character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty&#x27;s parents
(Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both
portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if
they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the
same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and
made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the
bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone.
We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so
pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate
him.<br /><br />The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it,
it has got it: even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It
will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff
or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to
be missed.<br /><br />My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and
Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are
friends but they don&#x27;t spend too much screen time together in the past
and I didn&#x27;t quite believe that they were going to &#x27;miss&#x27; each other
like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a
few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is
my only negative with the film.<br /><br />I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing
to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing
I have thought about though is this: surely if you are watching the
film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line
on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn&#x27;t you
just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it
before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with
and enjoy.<br /><br />4.5 / 5 <br /><br />For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com
