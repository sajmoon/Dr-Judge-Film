Michael J. Fox portrays Marty McFly, a teenager who, with the help of crazy
scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travels back in time to 1955 and
must ensure that his then teenaged parents get together romantically. I
found this first installment of a trilogy to be so bad that I didn't even
want to see its two sequels.
