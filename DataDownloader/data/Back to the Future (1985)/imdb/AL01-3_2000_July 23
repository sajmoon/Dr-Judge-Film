This film is the first in a very tight trilogy of movies that really fit
well together. It is funny, enjoyable and just plain &quot;awesome&quot;.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is perfect in the role of Marty McFly as he inadvertently
goes back in time. The damage that he causes by his presence in the 1950s
threatens his very existence. In order to avoid completely disappearing, he
must reunite his mother with his nerdy father, George, during their teenage
years.<br /><br />Mr. Strickland, Biff, Marty and George McFly are very memorable characters
and this is a film that you will want to see multiple times. Each successive
viewing will likely reveal some detail that was missed the previous time.
This film is really well done and I would recommend it to almost any
audience. I'd give this picture *** and 1/2 out of ****. This movie was best
viewed in the 1980s, but watching it now adds another dimension to going
back in time. Definitely make seeing this stylish, slick, funny and
enjoyable film a priority.
