1999_November 14 

This is the first one of the brilliant trilogy, and in my opinion the best
movie ever made. I have seen this film more times than any other
film.
It just has a certain magic, and the strong story, the stunning acting and
all the details makes it a must-see for young as well as old.I am sure it
will become a classic that will stand the test of time!
