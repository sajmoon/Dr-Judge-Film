This film captures the essence of both childhood fascination and
scientific
nonesuch. Marty McFly's persona is a vivid memory  from my own childhood,
and one that evokes the child in everyone. Not only does this movie
include
teenagers from the nineteen-eighties, but also from the fifties, when
McFly
goes back in time! So it is kind of like a mirror of youth cultures. This
film is a great example of energetic, fun filled cinema!
