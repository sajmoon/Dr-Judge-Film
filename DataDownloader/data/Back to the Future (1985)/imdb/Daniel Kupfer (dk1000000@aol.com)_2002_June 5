Being 9 when i saw it first, this is still my all time fav. movie up to
now.
I think nearly everything has been said about this movie already in the
other user comments.<br /><br />I just can add, it combines the elements romance, comedy and
science-fiction
in a very well done fashion. Some people say its corny, but i don't think.<br /><br />I know some other movies which feature these elements, but tend towards
getting a bit corny or stupid (f.ex. Bill and Teds Excellent Adventures,
which nevertheless is very funny (if its compareable at all)). And many
more
sci-fi themed movies of the 80's...<br /><br />All in all, for me this makes up to a very sympathetic science-fiction
movie, which is enjoyable many times without getting worn
off.<br /><br />
