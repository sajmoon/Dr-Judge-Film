There are no loose plot threads in this movie; the time travel aspects are
handled consistently (I won't talk about the sequels...); the acting (from
the entire cast) is excellent; the characterisations are good; the thing is
well paced; and (congratulations America!) it's not over sentimentalised.<br /><br />Congratulations to all involved in the perfect 80s movie.
