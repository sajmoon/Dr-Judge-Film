One of the most entertaining science fiction movies of all time, since
&#x22;E.T.&#x22; and &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;. &#x22;Back to the Future&#x22; tells the story of Marty
McFly, who accidentally gets transported into a time machine, built by
a wacko-genius scientist named Dr. Emmett Brown, and accidentally gets
sent into 1955, and interacts with his parents as teenagers. Know he
must get his teen parents together before the space-time continuum can
mean the end of the world, and he must get back home to 1985 quickly.
Now, I&#x27;m a big fan of science fiction, and this movie is a gigantic
time-travel masterpiece. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both lead
an all-star cast with incredible and hilarious performances. The cast
also includes the many great performances of Lea Thompson, Thomas F.
Wilson, and Crispin Glover. Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job of
putting the movie together, and he joins Bob Gale in writing a
well-written tribute to science fiction. The sound is super and superb,
the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the
soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are
well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more,
and I&#x27;m always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and
over again. &#x22;Back to the Future&#x22; is science-fiction genius, and it&#x27;s
one of the many groundbreaking cinematic achievements in history. &#x22;Back
to the Future&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;an incredible science-fiction tale,
filled with entertainment to enjoy&#x22;.
