This movie was THE movie of the summer of 85. To this day, the film
plays very well. I love watching the film for all the fantastic
performances that are here. Fox is perfect as Marty, Lloyd is excellent
as Doc. Glover is fantastically wormy as George, Leah Thompson is equal
parts innocent and sexy as Lorain and Thomas Wilson is the epitome of
the class bully.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that will continue to play on and on with
so many generations because of the timeless themes that are excellent
combined in a wonderful ensemble set of actors. Even though I own this
movie on DVD, every time it comes on TV I stop and watch it and
remember back to the summer of 85 when I first watched it and smile the
whole time.
