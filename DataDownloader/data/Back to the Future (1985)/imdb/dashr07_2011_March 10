Back to the Future is the one the best movie I&#x27;ve seen in my entire
life! The main reason I liked it was the plot, characters, well
everything! I won&#x27;t reveal it since it&#x27;s not fair to some people that
have never seen it. For first timers: I guarantee you will not regret
watching it and will want to see it, over and over again! <br /><br />Even though it&#x27;s been 25 years since they released it, the classic
never died. Every time I watch it, the movie still feels like new! I
once heard a rumor they may do a remake and they might use Bieber as
Marty McFly (I pray to god he won&#x27;t be in it!!). I don&#x27;t want to see a
remake happening, not just Bieber, because it destroys the classic. But
that&#x27;s just my opinion.
