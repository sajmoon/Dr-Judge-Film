How do you review one of the best, most famous comedies of all time?
What is there that hasn&#39;t already been said? I suppose I could comment
on how amazingly well-written the plot is, how everything fits together
perfectly and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Or, I could mention
how hilarious it is; the subtle jokes like Lone Pine Mall, the
absurdity of some of the characters, the expression on Crispin Glover&#39;s
face. Perhaps I could say how incredible the effects are, and say how
great it is that they still hold up today. After that, I could say
something about how these are the characters that Micheal J. Fox and
Christopher Lloyd will always be remembered for. That would link in to
the fun 80&#39;s soundtrack. Then I could end the review by saying how much
I love the ending, how it almost makes you want to grab the sequel of
the shelf right away. Oh well, I guess it&#39;s all been said before...<br /><br />9/10
