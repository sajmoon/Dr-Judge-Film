After 20 years this movie is still one of the best. Once you get into
this movie you don't want to get out. I like this movie so much that I
have watched it more times than I can count!! Just the music in it
alone you'll love. With the exception of the first 15 minutes you'll
really enjoy this movie. <br /><br />I urge you to buy this movie, and the whole rest of the trilogy because
it's something the whole family will love. It's heart pounding
entertainment and it was done very well by a very good director! This
movie may now be a part of the past but, the future lies in our
hands!!!
