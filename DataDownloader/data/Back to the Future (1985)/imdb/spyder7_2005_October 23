I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year
lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has
it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, &quot;Wow, Hollywood was
once capable of putting magic on the screen.&quot; It really makes you
wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.<br /><br />To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are
superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every
scene. Today&#39;s film editors should watch this film a hundred times to
see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction
is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are
perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie.
Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of &quot;Doc&quot;,
and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.<br /><br />When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see
an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was.
I&#39;m so glad I was wrong.
