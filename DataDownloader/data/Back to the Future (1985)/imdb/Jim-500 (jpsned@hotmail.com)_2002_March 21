One of my all-time &quot;best&quot; movies.  <br /><br />If you're looking for sheer entertainment with a lot of laughs, cleverness
and zaniness, watch this gem. It has a lot of hidden gags you definitely
won't catch on the first viewing. It even has some social commentary for
those in the high-brow set.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about it was the beautiful Claudia Wells--she
looks just like my girlfriend who had just broken up with me when I saw it. 
It was hard to watch her kiss!
