This film is probably one of the best films of all time and a modern
classic. I don't really like sci-fi films but this appeals to people on
so many levels and genres that things like that don't really matter.
Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown to absolute perfection when he swans
around as if conducting an orchestra. Michael J Fox is the star of the
movie but the supporting roles are cast so well that all of the
characters are stars in their own right. I particularly like Thomas F
Wilson as Biff and the way that he gets more manic and vicious as the
trilogy unfolds. The combination of excellent special effects,
brilliant directing and the true skill of the actors means that this is
one of the few mainstream cult classics. It's a film for the whole
family without being patronising or babyish. Ace!
