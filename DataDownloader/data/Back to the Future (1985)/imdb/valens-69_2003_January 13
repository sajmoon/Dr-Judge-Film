Back To The Future is a great movie from what i feel is the best decade for
films the 80's.<br /><br />Back To The Future rates as one of my favorite films of all time. The cast
is top notch. The Directing and Screenplay are both great as
well.<br /><br />The year is 1985 Doctor Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) has created a time
travel out of a Delorean car.<br /><br />He is showing his invention off to his friend Marty McFly(Michael J.
Fox)<br /><br />Terrorist then show up and kill Dr.Brown, Marty hops in the Delorean and
takes off. Once he reaches 88mph he time travels and ends up in his town in
1955.<br /><br />While there he meets his father has a teenager George McFly(Crispin
Glover)<br /><br />His father is being bullied by Biff(Thomas Wilson)<br /><br />Marty is in shock seeing his dad as a teen and seeing what a geek his dad
is.<br /><br />Now the plot starts to take off, Marty sees his dad is about to get hit by a
car so he pushes him out of the way, and Marty gets hit by the
car.<br /><br />George runs off, and the man in the car gets out and brings Marty into his
house.<br /><br />And the house he is in is his mothers house.<br /><br />While there he meets his mother Lorraine(Lea Thompson) as a
teenager.<br /><br />Lorraine has a crush on Marty, and Marty has just changed the
future.<br /><br />When George was hit by the car that's how he met Lorriane and they fell in
love, but since Marty saved him he changed everything.<br /><br />Marty looks to find Dr. Brown he needs his help on getting home and making
sure his parents meet and fall in love.<br /><br />Marty finds Dr.Brown and is able to convince him he is from the
future.<br /><br />And from then on Marty tries to make things right with George and
Lorraine,and Marty has to find away to save Dr.Brown from his fate 30yrs
into the future.<br /><br />Dr.Brown has to try and find away to send Marty back to
1985<br /><br />Solid acting from the cast but Crispin Glover is the stand-out.<br /><br />Crispin Glover by far stole the show here with his performance.<br /><br />Produced by Steven Spielberg, and written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob
Gale.<br /><br />The script was perfect.<br /><br />And Director Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job.<br /><br />Pop musician Huey Lewis has a cameo.<br /><br />And Huey Lewis and The News have i think 2 songs on the sound-track one of
them is the very cool song The Power of Love.<br /><br />Back To The Future is a must see, It's a classic<br /><br />I give Back To The Future 10/10
