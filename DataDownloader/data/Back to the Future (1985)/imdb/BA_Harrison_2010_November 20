My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I
hit play on the remote and I&#x27;m instantly whisked back to 1985, when
hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17
years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.<br /><br />Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the
film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven
Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the
50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip
down memory lane: it&#x27;s a rollicking adventure, a charming love story,
and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael
J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the
lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd,
amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s
soundtrack.<br /><br />A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its
inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will
continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation
is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids
of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs...
