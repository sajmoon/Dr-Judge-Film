In All three Back to the Futures, there are a few things that happen
again in different ways in each movie. One thing is in BTTF part one,
After Biff has yelled at Marty's dad for destroying the car, he says
&quot;say hello to your mother for me.&quot; to Marty then in BTTF part two, old
biff says to Marty Jr. &quot;say hello to your grandma for me. Of course,
Marty's mom is Marty juniors' grandma. Another thing is that in all
three movies, Marty is knocked out and then wakes up thinking what
happened was a dream and then his mom says different things.
BTTF:You're back in good IL 1955 BTTF2: You're safe on the 27th floor
BTTF3: You're safe at IL McFly Farm<br /><br />Biff always ends up falling into manure in some way and he says
&quot;Manure, I hate manure!&quot; <br /><br />In the first two movies, Marty is chased by the bullies in a similar
way. <br /><br />In all three movies, Marty is in a restaurant or bar and Biff comes in
saying &quot;McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here.<br /><br />In all three movies, biff says (while knocking on either Marty or
Marty's dad's head), &quot;Hello, anybody home? Think McFly think!&quot;<br /><br />I think there are a few more so I'll think of them and then post them.
If you can think of any other ones please post them. Thanks!
