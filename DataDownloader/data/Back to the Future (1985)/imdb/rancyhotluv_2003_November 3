I'm a very nostalgic person and &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is also extremely
nostalgic in aspects of it's plot. It has been one of my all time favorite
movies as a kid and has stuck with me ever since. I think &quot;Back to the
Future&quot; is a perfect blend of everything mounting to a successful
satisfaction to viewers of all ages. Watching it as a kid, I got the
pleasures of knowing such things imaginatively exists as time travel and
time continuum. Its' fast pace of the movie keeps you well focused, on the
edge of your seat and always guessing the next plot. It really is a
succsess
in making it enjoyable for a wide range of age in the audience, a movie
that
can be watched with cross generations whether vertically(gernations within
family) or horizontally(being in different decades). I must have watched
it
over 30 times and I still find myself discovering something new each time,
and that's another trill of the movie, it never gets old.<br /><br />Another big success are the characters. They are so well given credit to
as
they are all very distinctive but inseparable characters. It's nice to sit
down with a movie and find the character as lovable as Marty or wacho and
unpredictable as Doc Brown. I think there's no chance for a better cast,
they are undoubtedly the best duo for this particular film.<br /><br />As for the plot and twist of the movie, I'll just say that the writers are
brilliant in everyway a brilliant creator can be. Go see for yourself, and
it's a garentee that you won't find this movie dissapointing, and is
suitable for all ages.
