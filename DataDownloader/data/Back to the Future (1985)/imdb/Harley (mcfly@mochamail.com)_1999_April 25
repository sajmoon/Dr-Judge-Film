1999_April 25 

I'll have to agree with the many other comments that said the movie is best
if you don't think about it. There are plenty of flaws in Back to the Future
that I don't think I need to mention, but none of them have anything to do
with the words untalented cast,  or low quality writing. It was obviously a
successful movie because 14 years later, there are plenty of fans remaining-
including me, who was born the day before Back to the Future's setting date
(october 26, 1985). I'll end by saying I think Crispin Glover (George McFly)
did a wonderful job  playing his part and shouldn't be neglected.
