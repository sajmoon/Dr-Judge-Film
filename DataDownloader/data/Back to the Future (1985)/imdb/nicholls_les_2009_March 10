2009_March 10 
Hard to find fault with this film in any way. This is the only film I
have watched in the Cinema where the audience broke out in spontaneous
applause at it&#39;s conclusion. Michael J Fox was perfect for the part and
all the cast and Christopher Lloyd is exceptional, creating one of
those characters that you will always remember. The 2 sequels are both
good but nothing matches this first film and the excitement it
generates. My only small criticism was the Johnny B Goode scene where a
supposed relative of Chuck Berry says to him on the phone &#39;I&#39;ve found
that new sound you were looking for&#39; .... When will black music artists
start getting credit for giving us all the great genres of music? OK I
know it was tongue in cheek humour but it just annoys me. Rant over! It
is still a 10/10 movie.
