Back to the Future isn&#x27;t just a fantastic sci-fi. It is also a funny
comedy, a high school movie, and an action movie. This film takes all
these genres, puts them together, and makes a classic. There is so many
famous lines in the movie that everyone can have their own favorites.
There isn&#x27;t one joke that falls flat, and there is multiple side
stories to it. There is the main story of Marty trying to get back to
1985, the story of him trying to get his parents together, the story of
Biff Tannen the bully, and many more. All these side-stories are either
predictions in 1955 of what 1985 will have, or they add tension. Marty
has to take care of all these problems before he can go back to 1985.
Due to the fact that he only has a certain amount of time to do these
things tension builds in the climax. It is a great movie, and one of
the best of the 1980&#x27;s.<br /><br />4 stars out of 4
