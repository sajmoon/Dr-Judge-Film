1999_January 8 

This is one I grew up with.. I've had it on tape since I was little and I
love renting all three every so often and watching it all the way through.
The characters, the funny little lines, everything contributes to this great
movie!  I could go on and on... but I won't, I'll just leave it at the fact
that I'll always love it!
