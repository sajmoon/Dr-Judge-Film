The greatest film ever made. Pitch perfect in every department, it
boasts a career-best performance from Michael J. Fox, plus faultless
support from Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and
especially Christopher Lloyd, who's just wonderful. Bobs Zemeckis and
Gale have fashioned a drum-tight screenplay that deftly balances
comedy, drama, sci-fi and romance. Matching it all the way are Alan
Silvestri's goosebumps score, the pin sharp editing, the - well, just
everything. It's as flawless as movies get. What's not often trumpeted
when it comes to this film is just how poignant it is, from Doc's
refusal to listen to Marty's warnings about the future, through the
decay of Hill Valley between the '50s and the '80s, to the teenage
dreams crumbling into adult reality.
