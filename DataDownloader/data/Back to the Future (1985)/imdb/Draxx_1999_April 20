1999_April 20 

Back to the Future does an excellent job in what it sets out to do:
entertain. However, you must adjust your brain so that you cannot think
when
watching it; otherwise, the time-travel paradoxes will fall on you like a
load of bricks. This film is a classic example of what can happen when the
time-travel theory is taken too far. I guess the filmmakers must have had
a
tough time making the story work. And it does, but it's nothing you would
want to think about too much. Acting won't win any Oscars, but I enjoy
performances of both lead actors. The sequels to this film are not as
great
as this one (mainly lacking in originality), but still very
enjoyable.
