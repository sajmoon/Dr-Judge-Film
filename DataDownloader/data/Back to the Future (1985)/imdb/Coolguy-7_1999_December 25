This has been one of my favorite movies for quite awhile.  It's just plain
funny.  One of the funniest characters on the movie was Marty's father
George.  His goofy laugh and the tone that he uses all the time makes him
hilarious.  Another interesting character was Biff Tannen, the school bully.
 He would always get sayings wrong such as &quot;Make like a tree and get outta
here!&quot;  Who could possibly forget Christopher Lloyd's performance as Dr.
Emmet Brown?  This film has it all: science fiction, comedy, romance, etc. 
It's sure to delight a number of people.
