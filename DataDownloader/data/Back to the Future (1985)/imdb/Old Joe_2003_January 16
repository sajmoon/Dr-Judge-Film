I am sure at one stage or another that your parents would have said to you
`I was young once to you know!' Yet for some reason we all find it hard to
believe that our parents were once teenagers. In the 1985 classic 'Back To
The Future', young Marty McFly gets the chance to experience what time
travel is, how different his home town is in the '50s and also what his
parents were like as teenagers.<br /><br />The year is 1985 - but not for long. Because teenager Marty McFly is about
to be blasted back to 1955 aboard the plutonium powered DeLorean created
by
eccentric genius Doctor Emmett Brown. But when Marty accidentally keeps
his
parents-to-be from falling in love, it triggers a time shattering chain
reaction that could vapourise his future - and leave him in the past! Now,
Marty's only hope is to change history - before the clock runs out on his
one-in-a-million chance to get himself Back To The Future!<br /><br />This film is incredibly clever in what it portrays. Its story is unique,
original and different to the common time travel theme. The story for BTTF
was written by Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis. Bob Gale one day
wondered if he would have been friends with his father as a teenager, when
he was a teenager. With that in mind the pair went about writing a script
that had the element within it. Their comedic touch was exceptional, yet
this story has many elements that make it very complex. The change that
had
to happen when Marty goes from 1985 back to 1955 is of major importance to
the story or the whole project would have been a failure. It is no wonder
that both men got an academy award nomination for their most intelligent
script.<br /><br />Bob Zemeckis was coming off his success of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984)
when
he took on directing BTTF. His grand vision for this project made it the
great success that it still remains today.  It was of great significance
that Bob had Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer of BTTF. I am not
surprised, as this movie would have been right up his alley. Spielberg had
a
busy time in the summer of '85 when BTTF was released, with another of his
productions being released at the same time including the classic kids
adventure,
'The Goonies'.<br /><br />The cast for this film was well chosen and acted. Michael J. Fox had a big
work load when he took on the role of Marty McFly, as he was
simultaneously
doing the TV show 'Family Ties' as well. He was working days lasting
18 -20
hours. Taking that into consideration, it is the most professional
performance from Fox. His character takes on so much, but Fox's
performance
is flawless. Fox also showed how versatile an actor he really was,
learning
how to use a skate board and showing off his guitar skills as well. Then
there was Christopher Lloyd who was perfect as the nutty professor Doc
Brown. Lloyd had a two dimensional role in BTTF which was entertaining to
say the least. Marty is warned by his nemesis school teacher Mr.
Strickland
(James Tolkin) to stay away from the good Doctor, as he is 'Dangerous, a
nutcase and will get him into big trouble'. This warning turns out to be
so
true.<br /><br />Other notable cast members include Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and
George
McFly (Crispin Glover) who play Marty's wacky parents. There roles called
for them to be transformed into older people via the use of make-up. I
like
what they did for the movie, as their performances had to be different for
each new part to the film. Marty's siblings include Dave (Superman star
Marc
McClure) and Linda (Wendie Jo Sperber), while Marty has a gorgeous
girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). I also like the bad characters in
BTTF. They include people such as Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is a
mean guy for the majority of the film, and picks on poor George McFly. It
is
fascinating to see George's son stick up for himself against a much
younger
Biff.  One of Biff's sidekicks happens to be a guy named Match (Billy
Zane).
In fact, this was Billy's first ever movie role. Bigger things were going
to
come for him in the future. Ironic?<br /><br />The idea of time travel must have been a difficult to bring to life on a
production such as this. Zemeckis toyed with the idea that a refrigerator
could be used as the transporter through time, but he was afraid that
young
children might try and hop in their own fridge and get trapped. So he
decided to use a car, which was a good choice. Having it be as unique a
car
as the DeLorean was excellent, as the car has funny doors and looks
some-what futuristic. This movie is also clever in the way that it shows
what an experience time-travel might be like. What can happen to your
transportation and the way you are transported, are captured beautifully
in
BTTF.<br /><br />This film is a lot of fun that the whole family can enjoy, whether it is
Mum, Dad or the kids. I am not sure what genre to call it, perhaps a
'teen,
family, sci-fi, coming of age, adventure story'. It is also a movie that
gives hope to its viewers. I believe it is saying 'what has happened in
the
past or right now, might not happen in the future', which is a good a
message for the many different people that watch it.  This movie has an
incredibly good soundtrack (with Huey Lewis and the News smash hit -
'Power
of love') and if you have access to DVDs, take a look at the 'Back To The
Future' trilogy DVD, as it is one impressive pack.<br /><br />CMRS gives 'Back To The Future': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant
Film)<br /><br />
