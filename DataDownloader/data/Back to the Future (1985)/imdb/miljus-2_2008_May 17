Back to the future is surely in the list of the most entertaining
movies ever made, you would not see the time pass.I Loved every minute
of it especially when Micheal J Fox goes back to 1955 and meets his
mother.Micheal j fox and Chritopher Lloyd are simply terrific in this
movie brilliantly directed by Robert Zemeckis who made some of the most
entertaining movies in film history .It stands as the best sci fi
comedy movie ever made and captures the level to be listed in every
list of top movies ever , 2 sequels followed which even captured the
same level of this one but this one remains the best,although the whole
trilogy is nothing short than hilarious.
