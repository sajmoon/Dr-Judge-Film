I grew up with this movie, it has to be my favourite film of all time.
I have seen it hundreds of times and it just doesn't get boring.
Michael J Fox became one of my favourite actors after this film and i
followed his career into other films. The cast must've worked hard with
several actors playing 2 parts and it finish's well to be open for the
sequel. A superb plot which has a fantastic storyline and superb actors
and it uses a classic Irish car in a Delorean. Robert Zemekis as
director was fantastic and choosing Michael J Fox as the main lead was
the best thing they could have done A fantastic film for all ages and i
will be showing my kids this film when i have some. Even though it is
20 years old it still is one of the best films made in my opinion
anyway
