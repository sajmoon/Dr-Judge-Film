  Next to ghosts, time travel movies are widely entertaining when they throw
fourth-dimensional reasoning out the window. Marty McFly goes back in time
and prevents his parents from meeting so he vanishes, right. Wrong! He has
already been born in a timeline that still exists in another Quantum
reality. He's just a visitor from another future timeline apart from the one
he altered.  The only reason to restore his parents' relationship would be
to create a future along that timeline to go to in the first place. &quot;Don't
forget to think fourth dimensionally.&quot; says Dr. Emmett Brown, wonderfully
played by Christopher Lloyd, but now the bane of his existence thanks to
numerous would-be impressionists. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover fit right
into the 1950 sequences, as does Thomas F. Wilson as the idiot/bully Biff.
The script as are the culture shocks between the Fifties and the Eighties
are wonderful and the cast does a wonderful job. This is a great movie for
anyone to watch over and over, but it is best seen on video rather than with
commercial interuptions.
