The title of this movie is &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. In 1985, Marty Mcfly
who is an everyday teenager went to the time travel in 1955 with a time
machine &quot;DeLorean&quot;. It is invented by Marty&#39;s friend Doctor Emmett
Brown(Doc). But the accident happenes. Marty privents his father and
mother&#39;s first meeting accidentally. Then he has to get them back
together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own
existence. In addition, there is one more accident in 1985. It happens
to Doc!! DeLorean uses plutonium as fuel so Doc steals plutonium from
Libyan fringe group then they shoot him to death. So Marty has to tell
Doc about this accident too in 1955. Will he able to solve
all...or...!? This movie is enjoyable for men and women of all ages I
think. It is thrilling and dramatic with happy ending. I recommend you
to watch it and sequels(2,3).
