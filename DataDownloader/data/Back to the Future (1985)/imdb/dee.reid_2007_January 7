Why is &quot;Back to the Future&quot; my favorite movie from 1985? Because that
was the year I was born! I&#39;ll be turning 22 this year, as will this
film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last
half-century, with other hits including &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994) and &quot;Cast
Away&quot; (2000). But his best will always be &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; at
least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time
machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces
wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the
DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before
he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and
paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to &#39;85,
before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has
inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his
then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and
falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young
Doc Brown&#39;s help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F.
Wilson), the local tough. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; remains a comedy
classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and
laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from
Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the
future with his fight against Parkinson&#39;s Disease.<br /><br />10/10
