Back to the Future was without a shadow of a doubt one of the best films of
the 1980's, everything about it is just so great, the story, the acting, the
music and the special effects. It was a huge hit in 1985 and I caught it on
video soon after, it was the most entertaining and feel good movie I had
seen up to that point. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd got the roles of
their life in this film and Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson are great too.
The whole time travel concept is brilliantly realised, the great thing about
time travel is that it gives the film-makers many oppurtunities to insert
some clever in jokes into the movie and they do that a lot in BTTF. They
promised follow up at the end of the movie arrived four years later, which
interestingly was filmed at the same time as Part III. Although they were
enjoyable enough I couldn't help but be disappointed by them, neither had
the magic of this one unfortunately. ***9/10***
