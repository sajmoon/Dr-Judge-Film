2005_March 20 
Picked up the Back to the Future Trilogy(Full Sceen) from Costco(i
guess you call it wholesale market...) for only about $20(Tag $18.99).
I let it sit on my desk for a little while, but then just had to watch
it. Then the next one, and then the next one. Now after all three I
want more! I looked up the director at this site IMDb.com and it says
he directed too many great movies like Forest Gump, Contact, way too
many to list. I guess I'll have to watch them in time. These three
movies have the sci-fi 80's feeling like Total Recall, without the
violence. These have to be the best movies in the world(In my mind).
THE END
