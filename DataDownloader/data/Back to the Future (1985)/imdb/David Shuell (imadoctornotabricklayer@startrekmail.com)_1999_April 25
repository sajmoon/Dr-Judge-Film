1999_April 25 

What better time travel movie than Back to the Future.  It seems like only
yesterday I walked out of the theater July 3rd 1985, saying to
myself...&quot;That was the best movie I've ever seen&quot;.  I still say that today,
even after seeing it over 200 times.  Even though I can repeat every word
throughout the movie...I still get goosebumps in wonderment if Marty will
make it in time...Enough said....The greatest of all movie of all time..(Now
if only they would release it in letterbox)
