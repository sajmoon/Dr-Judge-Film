1999_October 13 

I wish I would have seen this on the big screen.  When I first saw this
movie I fell in Love with it.  This is the best time travel movie of all
time..(unlike those with telephone booths).  This is also the best 80's
movie I think.  I just hope someday they come out with a part
4.
