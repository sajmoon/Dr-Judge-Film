I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie
some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely
when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't
know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners
etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years
old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this
again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated
- I completely loved it. Buying the DVD back in 2002, I watched this
movie very regular in a period, pausing a while, trying to memorize
everything. And it only raised my fascination and love for Back to the
future.<br /><br />The plot? Marty McFly (J Fox) is an ordinary teenager in 1985 who
usually meets his friend, the crazed doctor Brown (played by genial
actor Christopher Lloyd), for some scientific researchs. But one night,
he will find out what Dr Brown really is preparing - a time machine
into a car. Surprised, but anyway fascinated, McFly loves the idea. But
of an accident, McFly is going back to 30 years earlier his present
date. And it is then he has to reunite his parents before everything
goes weird - and if he doesn't replace everything as it was before, he
risks to be unborn. <br /><br />Sounds crazy? Right. It does. But it is the point. Mixed with smart
humor, well-done dialogs and fine ending, it is probably one of the
best genre movies I've been watching. It's not only a science fiction
movie. It is also a coming-of-age movie, mixed with action, comedy and
drama. And all simply, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd, in
particular his crazy Einstein-hair, make this movie great. <br /><br />Highly recommended for you who want a mix of everything a Friday night.
