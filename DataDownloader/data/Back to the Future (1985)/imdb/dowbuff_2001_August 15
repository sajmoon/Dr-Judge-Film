This is one of those movies that everyone at some point in their life has
seen. As a kid I would watch this film,(and the sequels), religiously every
Saturday. Though I don't watch it as often as I did all those years ago I
still love it. <br /><br />Michael J. Fox is terrific as the role of Marty, and with the fantastic
Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown you know that this is something very special.
With the writing and directing talents of Robert Zemeckis this movie is one
that has to be in everybodys video collection.<br /><br />Marty is an ordinary teenager living an ordinary life, until gun towing
Libians force him back in time. As I've said before I'm not one for spoiling
a good film, so if you haven't already seen this, where the hell have you
been??!! Go out and rent it, and get parts 2 and 3 while you're at
it.<br /><br />Marks out of 10 &#150; an easy 10, one of the best films ever made. And remember:
&quot;Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.&quot;
