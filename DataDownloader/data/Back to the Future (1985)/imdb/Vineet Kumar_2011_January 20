(This is my First review on IMDb. I had to write it for the sake of
humanity and space-time continuum ;)<br /><br />Theme &#x26; Genre: The first thing which strikes me in BTTF is the theme,
which is by far the most puzzled idea ever conceived by human mind -
&#x22;Time Travel&#x22;. Every true science fiction fan (or for anybody for that
matter) have always wondered, if he could change the past. What if he
could visit the past and see what was it like to meet your parents when
they were your age? Its a truly wonderful idea, and with all its
anomalies and paradoxes, still never fails to amaze the audience with
the possibilities. In Particular, BTTF cant be put into just one Genre.
Due to Time travel, its Sci-Fi, but its comedy, Romantic, as well as, a
thriller, with many hair raising experience. The beauty of BTTF is the
combination of all these genre with an awesome fusion, without
overdoing anything.<br /><br />Story: The most important thing for a movie after the theme is its
story. And it hasn&#x27;t been compromised. BTTF part 1 has an exceptional
story line, which only becomes more interesting in subsequent parts.
Because of the time travel theme, you get to again witness a plot in
part 2, that already had been happened in part1, which is why time
travel is interesting, in the first place. (Even writing about it now,
is giving me goosebumps.)<br /><br />Effects: Imagine at a time sans GUI OS (Like Windows), how can you
imagine the creation of a 3D holographic shark coming out at you, or a
flying hover board, or a flying De-Lorean in the midst of air
traffic... I could go on, but you got the point..<br /><br />Music: Don&#x27;t even get me start on this. But I want to :) The music is
nothing short of epic. The grand nature of music, just compliment the
grand nature of the plots. Romantic song, &#x22;Power of Love&#x22;, a more
superb romantic song &#x22;Earth Angel&#x22;, the groovy &#x22;Back In Time&#x22;.. and
then the BTTF score by, the Outatime Orchestra, makes me feel like I am
a part of something big, a part of the movie itself.<br /><br />Conclusion: Well, everyone have a different taste, but I am talking
about the movie, who have a fan base of more than half a million on a
Facebook page alone. (as of the time at writing this review). A movie
which has been released on Blue Ray on its 25th Anniversary, along with
re-release in select theaters, and a movie which has been selected for
preservation in the United States National Film Registry! A movie which
is timeless, which never gets old, no matter how many times you see it,
that is, you had to had a taste in Sci-Fi though.<br /><br />And to say, its just a movie which is &#x22;25&#x22; yrs old! For some, its more
than a movie, its a genre in itself.
