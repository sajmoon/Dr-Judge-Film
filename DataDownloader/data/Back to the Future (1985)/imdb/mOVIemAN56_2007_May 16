Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages. I have not come
across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages,
when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story,
the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the
Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again
and again. It is a film that doesn&#39;t need brains to figure out, just
watch and you&#39;ll enjoy it.<br /><br />Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship
with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the
secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in
time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean)
breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high
school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way
to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents
and find a way to get &#39;back to the future&#39;. <br /><br />Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager
though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of
the jokes, though they don&#39;t come from his mouth. His inability to
realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the
past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His
performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back
to the Future so often.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His
eccentricity and his random proclamation of &quot;Great Scott!&quot; makes his
character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran
actor of Lloyd&#39;s background was needed to make the film work. If a
serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked.
His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the
funniest bit of all in the film.<br /><br />The portrayal of 50&#39;s life is right on par. Marty&#39;s interaction with it
is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives
a solid performance as Marty&#39;s father back in the 50&#39;s. What I find
great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You
really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the
love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to
get back to the 80&#39;s and you want Biff to get decked the whole film.
The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.<br /><br />4/5 Stars
