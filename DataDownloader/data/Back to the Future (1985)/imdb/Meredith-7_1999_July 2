1999_July 2 

I recently watched this film again after quite a number of years and I was
surprised by how well the film has held together.  Its really
entertaining,
all the characters are likeable, the premise is just great.  This is
without
a doubt one of the best films of the 80's.  Some of the metaphysical
aspects
of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present
etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and
the
basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably
correct.  What is great about this film is how they use the science
fiction
concept as a base without straying away from contemporary mid 80s America.
This film has a well deserved place in the top 250.
