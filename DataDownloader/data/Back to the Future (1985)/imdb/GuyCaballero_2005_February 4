I was watching the series again last week, and I struck for the first
time by how brilliant Thomas F. Wilson's performance was throughout it.
This guy plays SEVEN different characters throughout the three films
(including the 'butterfly effect' variations on the same character),
spanning 60 years in age, and each character is as funny, distinct, and
memorable as the one before it.<br /><br />Chistopher Llyod was excellent, Michael J. Fox was good, and the
supporting cast all performed admirably, but without Biff and his kin,
the series falls flat on its face. He was the glue that held the entire
trilogy together.<br /><br />9 out of 10 for the first movie, 8 out of 10 for the series
