The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future
and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80&#39;s. I was a
child from the 80&#39;s, and remember these movies well, and I also
remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be
exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn&#39;t, at least
not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so
unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those
flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be
happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to
sit there and think that back in the 80&#39;s, people really thought our
world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway,
I haven&#39;t seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised
that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through
the years, and the movie doesn&#39;t look like your typical 80&#39;s film
either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing,
yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to
the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with
lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most
exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic,
and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point
to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe,
maybe not. I don&#39;t really know. I just know I love these films and
wanted to comment on how well they&#39;ve held up after all this time. A
series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I
normally only watch movies once or twice. Not in this case.
