This film will always be a classic. 
Some will call it corny, or even hokie,
but it put a new spin on an old sci-fi storyline. 
And it was even funny! Granted, the whole 
concept was beaten into the ground with 
two sequels, the original film in the series 
demonstrates the timeless nature of this 
movie. History is always set in stone, but 
to provide the fantasy of minutely changing 
your current history is always fun to think 
about. This was also one of the first movies 
I actually watched in a theater, so I tend to 
have some sentimental value placed on this 
film. But then again, it's well deserved.
