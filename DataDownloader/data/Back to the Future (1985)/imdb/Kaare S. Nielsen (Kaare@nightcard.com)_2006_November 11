I watched this movie for the first time when I was like 7 or 8 years
old, and it captured med instantly. The home-made &quot;garage-build&quot; high
tech time-machine, that is in fact build into a DeLorean - a cool
legendary sports-car of the 1980&#39;s, are simply stunningly awesome for
young people, and if you are not young any more, well then you will be
during the movie. The great story, the action-packed adventure, and
most important; the extreme caution of following rules of time-travel
and the creativity of the countless details in the three movies - along
with the great cast of sympathetic and funny actors - simply makes this
trilogy a must see adventure for people of all ages. I am now 27 years
old, and I still watch the movies at least once or twice a year, and I
still find myself observing new details that I haven&#39;t noticed before.
This really need a re-release on the big screen in my opinion! (maybe
with some remastering)
