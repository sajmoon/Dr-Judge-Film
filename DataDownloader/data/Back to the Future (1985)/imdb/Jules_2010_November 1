Back in the decade of &#x27;In space no-one can hear you scream&#x27;, Lightsaber
swashbuckling Jedi and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger cradling that
not so delicate pump-action, bad-ass necessity; it seemed only
appropriate to throw time travel in the mix of a genre that was
starting to expand more and more with some good ol&#x27; computer
technology, which back then, didn&#x27;t have to become the primary tool in
a directors box of apparatus.<br /><br />So when Back to the Future spurted the fiery paths of tire grinding,
followed by a once handsome DeLorean turned four wheeled ice block, the
questioned was: what made it so much different, better, cooler? Simply,
whereas other sci-fi&#x27;s that demonstrated so effortlessly the compulsive
need to slap audiences jaw drop levels further down to the ground,
explosion by explosion, Back to the Future arguably took a more humour
through simplicity approach.<br /><br />Example, body language. Nothing that will be spoilt of course, but the
deliberate motions of characters (especially in the diner) can tell an
audience all they&#x27;d need to know about a character, before their
identity was fully revealed through this interaction. Funny, yes. But
not till it scratches the surface more deeply do things start to get
more than standard slapstick, especially where family is concerned.<br /><br />That doesn&#x27;t mean the film lacked, an albeit Michael Bay need for some
wanted explosions and top techno talk to remind us throughout it was a
sci-fi (&#x22;1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!&#x22;), and hadn&#x27;t
took the &#x27;Humour of his mum fancying him&#x27; path too far and sloppily. If
anything, science is more of a focus than anything else.<br /><br />Not for the obvious fact it&#x27;s a science fiction (Bravo) but more that
Marty is as confused with &#x27;Docs&#x27; long winded trails of scientific
calculations with himself as we are. And ironically, he understands the
ins and outs so easily his madness seems ordinary. It&#x27;s all Marty&#x27;s
dumbfound confusion and the audiences comfort of knowing &#x27;We never need
to know what on earth a Flux Capacitor is so let&#x27;s go along with it&#x27;.
This all makes the baffling intellect more of a reassurance everything
will work, rather than a panicky and frantic turn of heads to
understand every little detail as to not get lost in its &#x27;family
friendly&#x27; plot. And that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. It never needs to go
into drawn out explanations that only scientific universities would
host, it&#x27;s a thrill ride, Marty&#x27;s ride, our ride; with two more stops
yet to go.
