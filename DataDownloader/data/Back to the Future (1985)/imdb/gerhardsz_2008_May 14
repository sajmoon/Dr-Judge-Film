My god. I saw this movie at the cinemas when i was 14 years old. And it
Completely blew my mind. I can still remember my thoughts when I came
out of the cinema, completely exhausted, and empty inside, because I
WAS Marty Mcfly in the whole movie.<br /><br />I can not recommend this movie strongly enough. If i should rate all of
the movies I have seen in my entire life (I&#x27;m 35), this would rise
above them all, as a perfect 100% score. And I have seen them all.....
I&#x27;m watching Back To The Future tonight again for the 498.time.. at
least...<br /><br />My god. The PERFECT movie.... if i could marry a movie, it would be
Back To The Future...
