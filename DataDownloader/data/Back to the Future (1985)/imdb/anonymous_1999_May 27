A highly entertaining film, paying considerable attention to detail and
supported by a brilliant cast, Back To The Future will always be one of my
favorite films of all time. Packed with great humor, fantastic action
sequences and one of the best soundtracks you'll find, there's no reason
not
to take a trip back to 1985 and watch this truly awesome sci-fi comedy.
Unless of course, your Delorean's out of Plutonium.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is that I had to wait so long for the
sequels. The now infamous 'To Be Continued' ending was incredibly
frustrating, but, despite friends and family telling me otherwise, I
always
had faith that the adventure would be extended.<br /><br />
