Back to the Future, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea
Thompson, Crispin Glover, Tom Wilson, and Claudia Wells was great. The
director (Robert Zemeckis) and actors were dynamic. The writers (Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale) cooperated really well. When this movie came out
in 1985, it was a huge blockbuster. It was the initial movie in the
series of three. It covers many genres. This film wasn&#39;t adapted from a
book. It was actually written in the writers&#39; own words. Here&#39;s how I
found out about it: I was at Universal Studios and I went on a ride
called &quot;Back to the Future.&quot; Then, after the ride, my parents told me
about this picture. So I found out about it through word of mouth. Out
of all the Universal movies that I&#39;ve seen, this is the best!
