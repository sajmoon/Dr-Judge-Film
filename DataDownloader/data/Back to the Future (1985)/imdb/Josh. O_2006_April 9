This was a really good movie! It had a very good storyline to it and I
was just amazed.<br /><br />When I was younger, I used to think this movie was boring because I
didn&#39;t quite understand it. But now that I&#39;ve seen it again, I loved
it! I saw Back to the Future parts 1 2 &amp; 3 on TV. It was so good, that
I bought the 3 Disc DVD of them. My favorite is Back to the Future Part
2 (It&#39;s on my top 5 list), but part 1 and 3 are very good as well.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed if you take the time to watch it. It&#39;s a
really good movie and I&#39;m not surprised that it made the top 250 list.<br /><br />10 stars out of 10
