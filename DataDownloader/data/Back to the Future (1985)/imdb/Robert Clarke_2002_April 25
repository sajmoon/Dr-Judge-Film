One of my all time favourite films, Back to the future is a cleverly
executed masterpiece. It centres around a `mad scientist' known as Doctor
Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in his best ever roll) who invents a time
machine out of de lorean!. High school kid Marty McFly (Michael J Fox), who
is somehow the Docs best friend, gets involved in his schemes and
accidentally finds himself test driving the time machine and ending up in
1955 &#150; and bumping into his parents - as teenagers!! All kinds of trouble
and mayhem follows as Marty &#150; desperate to shake off the attention he is
receiving from his teenage mother(!) &#150; tries all roads to get `back to the
future'. Highly recommended for children and adults. Followed by 2 excellent
sequels.
