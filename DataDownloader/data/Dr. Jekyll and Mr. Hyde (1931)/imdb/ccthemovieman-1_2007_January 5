2007_January 5 
This was a decent early effort (first &quot;talkie&quot; movie presentation) at
the famous Robert Louis Stevenson story, this time with Frederic March
in the lead role, which he plays well.<br /><br />The romance parts with March and Rose Hobardt are somewhat corny. The
ending features a tremendous action scene with a very nimble &quot;Hyde.&quot;<br /><br />It was interesting to hear Jeckyll&#39;s name pronounced Gee-kle, with the
long &quot;e.&quot; I&#39;ve never heard it pronounced that way before or since.<br /><br />I thought March was better than Spency Tracy in the 1940s film but you
couldn&#39;t beat the women (Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner) in the latter
version. The ladies here were okay but no match for Bergman and Turner.
The same can be said for the film as a whole. It was worth seeing, but
not worth owning.
