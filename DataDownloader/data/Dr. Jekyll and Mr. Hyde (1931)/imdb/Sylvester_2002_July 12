I think that this is by far the best filmed version of the story, but it
contains one goof, which irritates me every time I see
it.<br /><br />There are several shots in which Dr. Jekyll looks at himself in the
mirror.
In fact, there was no mirror - he is filmed through an empty frame.
Unfortunately, in these &quot;mirror&quot; shots, no-one thought to move his parting
over to the other side!
