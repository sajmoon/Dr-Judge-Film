It&#39;s amazing that years before Sigmund Freud was writing about stuff
like the ego and the id, Robert Louis Stevenson, a great writer, but
not a man of science, was able to grasp at what Freud later said about
human behavior. There lurks in all of us a beast capable of doing great
evil, that man&#39;s civilized self is forever trying to control.<br /><br />Henry Jekyll, London society doctor, is engaging in experiments to
prove that theory. He&#39;s a gentleman in every sense of the word, engaged
to a proper English girl played by Rose Hobart here. It&#39;s funny, but in
none of the adaptions of this story is it ever explained what could be
in the potion that Jekyll concocts and drinks. But drink it he does and
Jekyll becomes the simian like Mr. Hyde, evil incarnate itself.<br /><br />Another reviewer pointed out the film is actually based on a play
adapted from the novel and done originally on stage by Richard
Mansfield in London. In that play the character of Ivy, a girl no
better than she ought to be attracts the attention of Jekyll when he
stops a man from assaulting her. He takes her up to her flat and she
makes an effort to seduce him. He resists, but the beast within
remembers.<br /><br />This film becomes one of the first to deal with the phenomenon of
stalking. Miriam Hopkins is a comely Ivy and Ivy herself is one of the
most luckless characters ever created in fiction whether she was in the
original story or not. <br /><br />Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde made movie audiences and critics start to take
Fredric March seriously as actor. Up to then he had played a variety of
lightweight parts on screen. Even so Paramount after this still
insisted on still casting him in those roles after he won an Academy
Award for Best Actor. When he got free of that studio contract March
got the parts he was so capable of. <br /><br />When MGM wanted to remake the film for Spencer Tracy they bought not
just the rights from Paramount, but the film itself. It was not seen
for many years and the VHS version I have of it has an MGM opening
logo, but the cast at the end says Paramount. Kind of unusual to say
the least.<br /><br />I do disagree with the application of the term science fiction to this
story. Hyde is a beast. But he&#39;s not something created by nature or
man, nor is he an alien from another world. We all have a Hyde within
us, it&#39;s how well we control him in our selves, and how well as a
society we control the Hydes that would do us harm that deems whether
we survive as a society or not.<br /><br />Hyde is very human, with no superhuman powers and no created weaponry.
Takes an extraordinary actor to play Jekyll and Hyde and do it well.
Only the best take a crack at it like John Barrymore, Spencer Tracy,
Jack Palance, and Kirk Douglas. And March is one of the very best. See
for yourself.
