Rouben Mamoulian&#39;s DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is one of the truly great
horror films of all time. The story has been filmed more than any other
in the horror genre, but it is Mamoulian&#39;s approach to the material
that makes this one stand out. Mamoulian explores the west&#39;s overrated
belief in free sensuality. His version of Dr. Jekyll, (Frederic March)
is a sexless, Victorian man of reason, who wants to run wild. And so he
does, but only after he concocts a special scientific cocktail that
unleashes his lower nature. Mamoulian depicts Hyde as a semineanderthal
brute, and March delivers on that characterization.<br /><br />When one takes the time to watch March&#39;s performance (his Jekyll is
sacharine saintly, his Hyde moves like a lurching simian marionette),
it&#39;s not hard to see why it won the Academy Award that year, while
other milestones like James Whale&#39;s FRANKENSTEIN and Todd Browning&#39;s
Dracula weren&#39;t even in the running. DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is a work
set apart. It&#39;s racy in ways that film in 1930s United States rarely
got to explore, it&#39;s bold in it&#39;s portrayal of upper middle class
society, and its opening sequences are dreamlike and surreal in a way
that really suck the viewer in. The audience is asked to take in the
world the way Jekyll sees it for the first ten minutes of the film, and
the camera-work cements in place Jekyll&#39;s abstracted reference. The
scene in which Jekyll persuades a charity ward girl that she can walk
unassisted is eerie precisely because of the way the camera follows her
stilted, semi-joyous gait and restrained happiness. The angle of the
shoot tells us Jekyll is looking at the rest of us the same way an
entomologist would look at an insect.<br /><br />Mirian Hopkins as the ill-fated Ivy manages to break through every
stereotypical interpretation of the East End floozy that cinema has
been burdened with. She&#39;s a movie &quot;bad girl&quot;, but not one with a heart
of gold, rather, Ivy is opportunist and craven. She is not one of
Charles Dicken&#39;s &quot;noble poor&quot;, and that&#39;s why her character works. She
is fleshy, sensual, sweet, what Jekyll wants, and what he certainly
cannot obtain from his &quot;finished&quot; and equally alienated fianc&eacute;e Muriel
Carew, portrayed here by Rose Hobart. Being a man from the upper
classes, however, he&#39;s not allowed to explore what he really wants, but
only what is socially acceptable. Or, &quot;it simply isn&#39;t done&quot;, as his
fianc&eacute;e&#39;s father, Sir Danvers Carew (Haliwell Hobbes) would say. Hence,
the looming mayhem. The wild man and woman must be set loose,by hook or
by crook. And so it is, armed with a club and an intelligence distorted
through a funhouse mirror.<br /><br />The novella of Robert Louis Stevenson is mutated, but that&#39;s the name
of the game in film. Still, all the liberties taken by screenplay
authors Percy Heath and Samuel Hoffenstein make sense. Is it scary?
Yes, in its portrayal of the social traps we allow ourselves to be
blocked into. That&#39;s some spookshow, and Stevenson knew it, and Rouben
Mamoulian knew how to work with that observation, and that&#39;s why this
film will hold its own decades from now.
