I, like probably many children born since WWII, learned about &quot;Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; through the Looney Tunes cartoons. For example,
Sylvester was chasing Tweety, so Tweety hid in a bottle labeled &quot;Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. About a minute later, he emerged as an angry,
giant, cat-hating killer.<br /><br />So, I finally got to see this movie version of Robert Louis Stevenson's
novel. Granted, it was an old-style Hollywood movie, so many things
seem kind of outdated, namely some maudlin dialogue. But overall,
Frederic March does a good job as the eponymous scientist who
accidentally brings out his evil side while studying good and evil
tendencies in human nature. The first time that I ever saw the movie, I
thought that Mr. Hyde looked like a monkey. Oh well. I guess that if
absolutely nothing else, the movie remains a good lesson about where we
shouldn't try to venture in scientific studies.
