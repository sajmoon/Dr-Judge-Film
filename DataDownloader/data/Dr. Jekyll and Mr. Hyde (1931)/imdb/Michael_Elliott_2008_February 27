Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) <br /><br />*** (out of 4) <br /><br />Fredric March won an Oscar for his performance in this talkie version
of the classic story. I&#39;ll say this at the start but I think March is
one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema but I&#39;d also say
that I think this is the worst performance from him that I&#39;ve seen.
Even though it&#39;s his worst performance there&#39;s still some greatness
that sneaks in at certain spots. I think March is very good coming off
as a very threatening character when he is mentally abusing the Miriam
Hopkins character. In pretty much all other times March comes off way
too over the top, which leads to more laughs than scares. There are
several sequences in the film where March&#39;s performance makes me laugh
at laugh as if I were watching a comedy. This unevenness makes for a
rather strange film that never works fully. I think Hopkins is the real
standout here as she gives a wonderful performance as the tortured
woman who caught Hyde&#39;s eye. The transformation sequences still look
good but I think they made Jekyll a tad bit too ugly. Even with all the
faults this remains an interesting film but I still prefer the 1913 and
1920 Barrymore versions.
