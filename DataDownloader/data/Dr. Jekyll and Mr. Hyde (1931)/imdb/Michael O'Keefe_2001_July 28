This is probably the most notable of the hand full of versions of Robert
Louis Stevenson's classic. Dr. Henry Jekyll(Fredric March)consumes a
concoction that transforms him into the crazed and sadistic Mr. Hyde. The
difference and sameness between good and evil is blatant, creepy and
feverish. March is outstanding in his Oscar-winning dual
role.<br /><br />Also starring in this horror masterpiece are Miriam Hopkins, Holmes Herbert
and Rose Hobart.
