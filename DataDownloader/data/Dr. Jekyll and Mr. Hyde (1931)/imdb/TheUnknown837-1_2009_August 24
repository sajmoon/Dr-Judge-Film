While the titles &#x22;Frankenstein&#x22; and &#x22;Dracula&#x22; are the most popular
surefire contenders for the most revolutionary horror film of 1931, I
would strongly argue that the adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s
story &#x22;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x22; is another title to be considered. This
film is not only significant in the fact that it&#x27;s one of only two
movies for there to be a tie between two actors in receiving the
Academy Award for Best Leading Actor, but it&#x27;s revolutionary in its
visual effects and Fredric March&#x27;s portrayal of a ferocious two-sided
madman and the effect he has on the people around him as he jumps
between sides.<br /><br />It&#x27;s because of this film that many are familiar with the story of
Jekyll and Hyde. And why shouldn&#x27;t it be? The film uses the original
Stevenson story only for inspiration and foundation and instead uses
its own imagination to create something new and yet surprisingly
powerful in its entertainment. Is it scary? No. Not by today&#x27;s
standards anyway. But is it haunting? Yes. It haunts you in the same
way that Count Orlok haunted you in &#x22;Nosferatu&#x22; (1922). The vampire
didn&#x27;t scare you in that film. But the image of a tall, pale
rodent-like humanoid stalking about a castle hall after a petrified
protagonist lingers on in your memory. As does the memory of Fredric
March as she transforms from a handsome young scientist into an
ape-like monster that begins to hound and possess a helpless young
woman played with great enthusiasm and energy by Miriam Hopkins, most
of whose performance had to be cut from the film due to censorship and
therefore cost her the possibility of receiving an Academy Award
nomination. Fredric March is equally brilliant as Jekyll and Hyde. The
film also stars Rose Hobart as Jekyll&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;e, Halliwell Hobbes as
her suspicious father, Edgar Norton as the comical, stammering butler
and Holmes Herbert in the one role that I think should have been
developed a little more for the character does have impact in the last
third of the story.<br /><br />Now I saw this film after I saw the 1941 remake with Spencer Tracy and
for those not familiar with that film, let me just warn you to see this
movie first. The remake follows the same story almost as if it were by
the book and recreates a lot of scenes, but it does not deliver the
same impact even though Tracy is almost as great as March in this film.
It&#x27;s only half the movie that this truly entertaining 1931 horror opus
is.
