I recently picked up a DVD with both copies of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
one starring Frederic March from 1931 and the latter with Spencer Tracy
in 1941. What I found interesting is how great the special effects were
as Jekyll transformed into Hyde. It was amazing considering that it was
1931. Miriam Hopkins was vivacious and appealed nicely to the dark
sexual side of Hyde. This version gave a fleeting glimpse of skin that
would not be seen post code. But that is not the appeal the real
attraction is March who is stellar in his portrayal of both characters.
The pennance Jekyll does as he laments his murder makes for a neat
ending and his transformation as he dies back to the good doctor.
