This is an excellent version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring a
young and excellent Frederic March as the doomed doctor. Miriam Hopkins
is Hyde&#39;s woman, and Rose Hobart plays Jekyll&#39;s well-bred fianc&eacute;.
Interestingly, though I&#39;ve seen the Spencer Tracy version and the
Broadway show, I had never heard Jekyll pronounced &quot;Jeekill&quot; until this
film.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the famous story by Robert Louis Stevenson
about a scientist who believes in man&#39;s dual personality, that of good
and evil, and experiments with a concoction that can bring out the dark
side of humanity. Unfortunately, he learns that, once the devilish Mr.
Hyde has emerged, Jekyll can&#39;t easily keep him sublimated. In this
version, Hyde is unbelievably horrible-looking, a cross between an ape
and a human - the makeup is magnificent and actually what you would see
in a horror movie. The film, directed by Rouben Mamoulian with camera
work by Karl Struss is way ahead of its time. It&#39;s early days in
talkies, but the use of morphing, split screens, and most of all, a
moving camera. When talkies first came out, the camera was in a box in
its same position throughout a movie. Hitchcock took the camera out of
the box, and the sound man walked off the set. Here, the camera moves
quite fluidly. and at the beginning shows the audience activities from
the viewpoint of Dr. Jekyll without showing him. Positively brilliant.<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins as Ivy, the victim of Hyde&#39;s abuse, is young, lovely and
sexy. Supposedly there is a nude scene in the film, which had been cut
when I saw it, though you do almost see Hopkins&#39; entire breast. Always
an excellent actress who came to Hollywood with vast stage experience,
Hopkins became known for portrayals of strong women and eventually
moved into character roles. As a terrified prostitute, she is very
convincing.<br /><br />Frederic March gives an excellent performance in the acting style of
the day, which was a little melodramatic. With so many actors coming to
Hollywood from the stage, when this film was made, these actors&#39;
technique before a camera had not yet been perfected. March is an
ebullient, happy Dr. Jekyll and a sinister, evil Hyde. He won an Oscar
for his performance. Contrast that to Spencer Tracy, who, when Somerset
Maugham visited the set of the &#39;40s film asked, &quot;Who is he now? Jekyll
or Hyde?&quot; It really had to do with the fact that Tracy did not use much
makeup for Hyde, depending rather on a change in lighting; also, the
film itself is less stylized.<br /><br />&quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; did not capture the London atmosphere of the
1941 movie, nor the eroticism, but it has an atmosphere of its own,
with Jekyll&#39;s large house and chaotic laboratory, and an overt sexiness
that the censors ultimately would crush. A real must-see.
