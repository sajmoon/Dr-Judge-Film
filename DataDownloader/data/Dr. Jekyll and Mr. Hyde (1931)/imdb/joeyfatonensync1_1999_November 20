1999_November 20 

I had to watch this movie for a class in high school &amp; I got nightmares
which lasted about 3 weeks.  I also hate black &amp; white movies.  The movie
stinks &amp; has lots of violence on it which I don't like.  I didn't find
this
movie entertaining at all, because I didn't care for the storyline.
