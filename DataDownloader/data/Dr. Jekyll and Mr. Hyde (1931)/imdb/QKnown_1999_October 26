1999_October 26 

Coming at a time when movie monsters ruled the world, this flick seemed to
just come and go. Yet, March did win an oscar, and you can probably see why.<br /><br />Not just his performance though, Its Rouben Mamoulian's techniques that are
used too!<br /><br />The clever transformation sequences and Jekyll's point of view shots are
well made given the time this film was made.<br /><br />Also the reason why Hyde is made to look and act simian is that  Mamoulian
said that he wanted to represent the primal man as Jekyll's evil side. And
watch for Hyde's apperance as it becomes more and more ape-like as the movie
goes on! ***1/2
