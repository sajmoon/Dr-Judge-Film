Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a wonderful split personality tale from Robert
Louis Stevenson, and out of all the film versions I have seen, this is
the most stylish, exciting and somewhat erotic. For one thing the
direction is efficient, and the screenplay is intelligent and
sophisticated. Also really impressive are the stylish cinematography
and the completely convincing make up.<br /><br />But the acting was what really drove it; Fredric March, what can I say?
Absolutely outstanding, thoroughly deserving of the Oscar, he was great
as the good hearted yet ambitious physician Dr Jekyll especially in the
truly touching moment where he breaks down in front of Muriel, but he
is even more impressive as the animalistic Mr Hyde with the help of the
very impressive single take transformation scenes. Miriam Hopkins is a
smouldering Ivy, at first she is all fun and lovable, then towards the
end she is close to heart breaking. Her chemistry with March is simply
great. Rose Hobart is fine as Muriel, perhaps she could have done with
a little more screen time, but she did very well with what she had. As
Dr Lanyon and Poole, Holmes Herbert and Edgar Norton are excellent.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant film, that is stylish and exciting. Personally,
and I may be alone here, but I was disappointed in the remake, by all
means it is worth watching, but I found it inferior to this film
because I thought it wasn&#x27;t as well made and as well acted. Anyway that
is a different story. 10/10 Bethany Cox
