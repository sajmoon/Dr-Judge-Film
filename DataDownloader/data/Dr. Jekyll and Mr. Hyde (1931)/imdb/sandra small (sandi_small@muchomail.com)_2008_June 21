The 1931 film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde takes the author&#39;s fable and utilises it on the one hand as a
means to create a work of art. However, on the other hand the author&#39;s
fable is utilised as a means to take a conservative swipe at
existentialist free thinking science. As such it suggests that science
without the control of a moral code has the potential to morph into a
hideous monster. But, as Jeykll (Fredeeric March) suggests; in a
utilitarian statement; science needs to make mistakes in order to
advance for the good. By such a method science becomes a questionable
subject for conservative values, thereby forcing dilemmas (relavant
today) as to whether genetic modification and cloning are synonymous
with good or evil.<br /><br />This film adaptation of Stevenson&#39;s fable also suggests that all men
are innate misogynistic monsters who are capable of domestic abuse,
rape and murder of women. But as Ivy Pearson (intelligently portrayed
by Mirriam Hopkins who gives just the right amount of fear to an
otherwise histrionic part) suggests; women sex workers are a
legitimised target for such evil. They are (from a conservative
perspective) immoral, undeserving nonentities, and as such without
society&#39;s respect, and thus no protection. In this respect Hyde is an
ironically justified character because he rids society of women who
work in the sex industry. <br /><br />Ivy&#39;s character is juxtaposed with Muriul Carew&#39;s (Rose Hobert)
virtuous &#39;lady&#39;. Because she subscribes to man made moral values she
gains the utmost respect of Dr. Jekyll. In this respect the film
suggests that men&#39;s behaviour is subject to women&#39;s actions. Moreover,
it highlights the double standards men have regarding women.<br /><br />Another underlying theme in the film is that of drug addiction - opium
use was prevalent in Victorian society, which was according to the
author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the narcotic of choice among English
gentleman in the 19th Century, as explained via his fictional character
Sherlock Holmes. Here the film deals with the negative affects of drug
addiction. Drug addiction as the film suggests makes monsters out of
gentleman, thereby making excuses for men&#39;s negative behaviour towards
women. <br /><br />While this is a well made film its character Dr. Hyde&#39;s appearance has
a B movie like quality which is comedic, and is no doubt what
influenced comedy adaptations of Stevenson&#39;s fable, such as Abbot and
Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1953). This is not intended to
detract from the artistic direction of the film by director Rouben
Mamoulian, which is brilliant in that it makes way for experimentation
with the then new fangled cinematic technology. (Of course
&#39;experimantation&#39; is within the heart of the film) As such Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde (1931) is a blueprint if not a lesson in how to use
cinematic technology imaginatively to create a masterpiece. Kudos also
goes to actors Frederic March, (deserving of his Oscar) and scene
steelers Miriam Hopkins and Edgar Norton, the latter as Jekyll&#39;s valet
Poole.<br /><br />In sum, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) is a creative, imaginative work
of art, which is cleverly utilised to critique scientific
experimentation; drug addiction, and to examine ideas of morality,
while confronting society with its double standards towards women.
