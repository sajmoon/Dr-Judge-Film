Having read several film books that describe this movie as a masterpiece of
horror, I decided to take a look.  While it certainly is a horror movie with
a supernatural element, it is less horror story and more about the state of
humankind, especially the male of the species.  Frederic March as Hyde is so
riveting, so powerful, and so grotesque in his id driven manifestations,
that one can't help but watch his every move.  Despite his disfigurement, he
knows only the sexual and lustful drives that have been released through the
experiments.  He is vengeful, controlling, and virtually unstoppable.  I was
amazed at March's athleticism.  I felt the spectre of this creature
dominating every scene. I felt for the victims of his obsession.  Mamoulian
creates dim atmospheres and a series of claustrophobic settings that
contribute to the threat.  Jekyll has lost control and can't pull Hyde back.
 What I saw in this movie, was what I hear on the news.  &quot;She was killed by
her live in boyfriend after a turbulent relationship.&quot;  I'd swear that nine
times out of ten when I hear about a murder of a woman, it's some unstable
brutalizer who she once welcomed into her home.  Jekyll released this
through his experiments.  Stevenson knew the nature of the impulses of
humankind, and knew that buried beneath many of those charming men is
submerged the Hyde of this movie.  I love the Barrymore film, but I think
this is the best of all the versions of this story.
