Terribly dated and really only notable for Fredric March&#39;s
Oscar-winning part in the titled roles and admittedly amazing makeup
effects. Author Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s scientist believes there is a
natural good and bad side to every man and thus a whacked experiment
ensues. Something goes awry though and horrendous crimes take place as
March unwittingly creates a dangerous alter ego. Basically a poor man&#39;s
&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (the 1925 version) or &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (the 1931
version) that would almost work as well as a solo act as March gobbles
up the scenery with dual over-the-top roles that carry the production
as far as it can go and rescues the whole thing from 1930s obscurity.
On a side-note, March actually tied with Wallace Beery (&quot;The Champ&quot;)
for the 1932 Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5.
