The three great classics of horror literature were released as films in
1931, Dracula, which came out as dull and deathlike, Frankenstein,
which came off as well done, and Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, which came
off as perhaps the best of the three.<br /><br />The story is known in popular culture. A scientist named Dr. Henry
Jeckyll who is living in Victorian London, creates a formula that
allows the evil side of his soul to take control of his body. This
alternative self whom Jeckyll dubs &#39;Hyde&#39; causes massive chaos before
being killed.<br /><br />Since this movie was pre code, it features scenes that just a few years
later would have been condemned as obscene. Particularly Hyde&#39;s brutal
treatment of a girl, and his violently beating a man to death. It is
quite shocking by the standards of the day! The script, acting, and
direction are genius. In particular Frederick March&#39;s portrayal of
Jeckyll/Hyde. Hyde is portrayed as a reversion back on the evolutionary
scale, with an Ape like appearance. His behavior is not portrayed as
evil, but rather, an embodiment of all the instincts and negative
impulses lurking within us, really quite genius for the time, and
March&#39;s portrayal brings that to life with a menacing, but natural
performance when Hyde.<br /><br />His portrayal of the Jeckyll half, is also impressive. He brings the
tortured, tragic man to life perfectly, but this is far overshadowed by
the Hyde part.<br /><br />The direction is brilliant. Under a different director, the film could
have turned out as just another horror like Dracula, but this director
chooses to take a philosophical take on the story.<br /><br />The sets, particularly Jeckyll&#39;s laboratory set, are very well dome, as
are the costumes, they do well in taking you back to the era. This may
also be the first usage in horror movies of the famous organ piece
often associated with Phantom of the Opera and horror stuff in
general(most people probably know what I mean). it appears in the
opening credits. The rest of the film doesn&#39;t have a soundtrack, which
was the rule of the time rather than the exception, though there are
several times in which Jeckyll plays a piano.<br /><br />However, I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve praised March as Hyde enough. He enjoys the
suffering of others which brings us to the instinct to dominate others.
His violent behavior can also be tied to that. March is just so great
in portraying the negative impulses that I had to mention him again.<br /><br />So if you want a great movie from the era, check this out. It is much
better than the others that year!
