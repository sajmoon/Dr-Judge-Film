A neglected masterpiece. When I picked up the two sided DVD I was
excited because the Fleming/Tracy version is on the order of a guilty
pleasure. But I soon realized that I had never seen the 1931 version.
This is a film that lingers in the memories of many film goers as still
photographs of Frederic March in his makeup. Watching it was a
revelation. The same changes to original content - Jekyl's bride-to-be
and her family - continue to wear wearily on the production, but
nothing could prepare me for March's work. As often as we've seen
&quot;transformations&quot; - this one is the BEST. Then young lion director
Rouben Mamouilan pulls out some dandy tricks. And the sexually charged
atmosphere before the Hayes code - was well - sexy as hell. Do yourself
a favor and watch it.
