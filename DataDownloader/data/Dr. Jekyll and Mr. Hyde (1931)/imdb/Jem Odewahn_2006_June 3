This is viewed by many to be the best cinematic re-telling of
Stevenson&#39;s original work, which is a tad odd as very little of the
novella remains. The concept of the duality of human nature is still
present in March&#39;s Dr Jekyll/Hyde, but a whole lot of sex and daring
visual effects have been added to Stevenson&#39;s controversial Victorian
work. The result? An excellent and entertaining film that will stay in
the mind for quite some time.<br /><br />Fredric March, one of the best actors of all time, won the Academy
Award for playing the dual roles. It&#39;s not hard to see why- March is
excellent in this one, and plays both Jekyll and Hyde with enthusiasm
and vigour. It&#39;s a very theatrical performance by today&#39;s standards.
but what a fun performance it is! March shows his incredible acting
range here.<br /><br />March&#39;s Jekyll is a repressed Victorian doctor who is interested in
both separating the two sides of human nature- &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39;- from
each other, and quickly marrying his rich fianc&eacute; Muriel Carew (Rose
Hobart). A slight hitch in his plans- Muriel&#39;s father insists that the
two lovers must wait eight months before they are married, so they can
wed on the anniversary of his own wedding. It&#39;s a rather laughable
concept actually, but it serves it&#39;s purpose as the pre-cursor to
March&#39;s wild rampage as Hyde. It seems the primary reason Jekyll wants
to marry Muriel is to bed her, and when he can&#39;t do that, he takes a
concoction of drugs and turns into the simian, sexually uninhibited
Hyde.<br /><br />March&#39;s make-up almost destroyed his wonderful looks forever, so it
deserves a mention here. Looking at through today&#39;s CGI-trained eyes,
March&#39;s Hyde is ridiculously overdone and more comical than scary.
Tracy&#39;s 1941 Hyde is a much subtler figure, which suits the narrative
better in some ways. However, Mamoulian effectively conveys to the
audience in his version that Hyde is having a lot of fun, is liberated
in his personal and sexual freedom, hence the &#39;comical&#39; aspects. March,
amazing in both comedy and drama, plays him at first like a
free-wheeling puppy, eager for discovery, than as a real monster as he
degenerates both in appearance and behaviour. The simian make-up suits
the notion of Hyde being &#39;semi-evolved&#39; in nature, so it all works out
in the end.<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins is the Cockney slut Ivy who Jekyll good-naturedly
attends to at first, then brutalizes her as Hyde. March&#39;s first
encounter as Jekyll with Hopkin&#39;s Hyde is a erotically-charged,
provocative affair. Jekyll&#39;s primal instincts and his need to unleash
them, quickly, are displayed in his overt sexual interest in Ivy. She&#39;s
a girl who knows the value of sex, too, as she sexily strips for him
after he makes a suggestive comment that her garter is perhaps too
tight. For those interested in film history, take note of these
powerful scenes between March and Hopkins- they would help bring on the
Production Code in a couple of years. A sexually aroused Jekyll is
grabbed and kissed by an explicit Ivy while she lies visibly naked in
bed, something that would be absolutely banished from films in just a
few years.<br /><br />Hopkins turns in an excellent performance in this one, very convincing
as the &#39;Tart With A Heart&#39; Ivy. She&#39;s a brazen, sexual creature,
complete with brassy blonde hair and cleavage, yet she&#39;s also
sympathetic . Her situation with Hyde (where she is &#39;kept&#39; by him) is
borne as much out of economic necessity as it is out of total fear. And
total fear is what Hopkins does best here- her scenes with March
ravishing her as Hyde are among the best in film history. She&#39;s a
cheap, tragic figure and provides an interesting contrast to the &#39;other
side&#39; of Victorian society reflected in Jekyll&#39;s fianc&eacute; Muriel.<br /><br />Hobart is rather weak in a role that is, admittedly, poorly written.
She has a one-dimensional role, and Hopkins is given much more
opportunity to shine. Interesting to see March and Hopkins battle it
out, acting-wise. <br /><br />Mamoulian builds an amazing atmosphere here with some studio-bound, yet
very Expressionistic sets. Lighting is used to great effect, and the
camera work was revolutionary for it&#39;s time. The subjective camera-work
at the beginning where we see the action through Jekyll&#39;s eyes was
innovative (a little shaky, but innovative all the same)as were the
wipes used constantly to juxtapose Ivy and Muriel. The garden party
scene with March and Hobart has some oddly fascinating shots, with
Mamoulian focusing on the lover&#39;s eyes and foreheads when they are
professing their love. Symbolism is used nicely throughout, with a
number of prominent statues and paintings depicting naked women. The
fire-and-brimstone hell imagery of Jekyll&#39;s lab is also a clever visual
effect- Jekyll is truly a man about to &#39;boil over&#39;.<br /><br />The transformation sequences are amazing for their time, and March acts
them so well. Much of the dialogue spoken is melodramatic and rather
hokey, yet we have some great lines. There&#39;s some rather fascinating
religious overtones to March&#39;s Jekyll who is looked upon as a God-like
figure by a number of characters. The crippled girl&#39;s cry, with hands
out, to Jekyll &#39;I can walk sir!&#39; is one of religious ecstasy, and Ivy
looks upon him as a saint who can save her from Hyde. Alas, that cannot
be. Hyde is a sinner as Jekyll is a saint, and we know exactly what he
does with Ivy when the scenes fade to black.<br /><br />I consider this better than &#39;Dracula&#39; or &#39;Frankenstein&#39; (both 1931
films) for Mamoulian&#39;s stylish direction, the presence of viable female
characters, the brilliant camera-work, and the acting of March and
Hopkins.<br /><br />Not the original source material, but a darn good film that uses the
female characters and the addition of sex to underline the dual side of
man.
