In December 1931 two classic films were released, each based on a
classic story about a man who makes a monster. One was Universal&#x27;s
Frankenstein, and the other was Paramount&#x27;s Dr. Jekyll &#x26; Mr. Hyde.
Earlier in the year Universal had released Dracula, the third monster
of 19th century literature. It should be noted that all three films
were based on stage plays rather than the books, which is why they were
so different.<br /><br />Everyone knows Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 story. Jekyll is a kind,
respectable doctor who invents a potion that turns him into someone
else. As Hyde, he is free to do all the naughty things he could never
do as Jekyll. But Hyde is not merely naughty; he is pure evil. When
Jekyll realizes this, he stops taking the potion, but finds himself
turning into Hyde without it. The twist is that we do not learn that
Jekyll and Hyde are one and the same until the end of the book. The
movies skip this aspect, since everyone in the real world already
knows. While the potion can be dismissed as a silly plot device, it
could also be a metaphor for alcohol or drug addiction.<br /><br />The story was quite popular and was immediately made into a play and
numerous silent films, the most famous one being the 1920 version with
John Barrymore. This 1931-32 version with Fredric March was the first
with sound, and is widely considered the best. Like the play, the film
adds a romantic element to the tale. Jekyll (March) is sexually
frustrated because his fianc&#xE9;e Muriel (Rose Hobart) insists on waiting
until they are married. After treating a prostitute named Ivy (Miriam
Hopkins), Jekyll is tempted to cheat on Muriel with her. That is when
he decides to become Hyde. Although tame by today&#x27;s standards, it is
surprising what these pre-Code films got away with.<br /><br />In the book, Hyde is described as short, ugly, and not exceptionally
strong. After he assaults a girl, another man is able to restrain him
until the police arrive. Some people complain that this film&#x27;s Hyde
looks like a caveman, but that is what he was: a Victorian gentleman
degenerated into a savage. His somewhat simian nature makes him strong
and agile, and he retains all of Jekyll&#x27;s knowledge. Besides, they
wanted to do a make up job as impressive as the one in Frankenstein,
and they did, transforming the handsome Jekyll into the hideous Hyde.
The two look nothing alike and no one would think they were the same
person. This Hyde was also a precursor to Universal&#x27;s werewolves.<br /><br />March&#x27;s performance was on a par with Karloff&#x27;s Frankenstein. For
example, his Hyde tastes raindrops like the Monster&#x27;s fascination with
a sunbeam. March won an Oscar for his performance, although it was
close, beating Wallace Beery of The Champ by one vote. Jekyll &#x26; Hyde
was the only horror film to win the Best Actor award until Silence of
the Lambs sixty years later. Notice that the butler Poole (Edgar
Norton) would play a butler again in Son of Frankenstein. Director
Rouben Mamoulian used camera tricks that were innovative for the time.
These include the POV shots at the beginning, Ivy&#x27;s leg lingering in
Jekyll&#x27;s memory, and the camera looking Jekyll in the face as he
changed into Hyde without any cut. The secret of this transformation
was kept for many years.<br /><br />In 1941 MGM remade the film with an all-star cast including Spencer
Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, and Lana Turner, and director Victor Fleming.
They also bought the original from Paramount and withdrew it from
public viewing for decades. Obviously, MGM wanted their version to be
the definitive one, and it is a good film. But when the 1931 film was
finally made available again, people realized that the remake was a
shadow of the original. For example, they could not duplicate the
transformation and used a simple dissolve instead. Even while it was
out of circulation, the 1931 Jekyll &#x26; Hyde was made into a
&#x22;photo-book&#x22;. In the days before home video, these books would use
stills from the film to tell the story like a comic-book. Frankenstein
was also made into one.
