     Since my predecessors on this board have already analyzed the film I
have this interesting little anecdote to add.  When Rouben Mamoulian was
casting the film the greatest challenge was to find someone for the title
role(s).  Someone suggested Irving Pichel who had just been in the Paramount
thriller MURDER BY THE CLOCK (try finding someone who has seen THAT one!). 
Rouben is alleged to have replied: &quot;Good God no!  I need someone who can
play Jekyll and Hyde and Pichel could only play Hyde!&quot;
    Of course Irving did go on to do many other things, including a
supporting role in DeMille's CLEOPATRA (1934) and directing DESTINATION MOON
(1951).  Film critic Alexander Woolcott once quipped &quot;Irving is rolling in
dough making motion Pichels.&quot;
