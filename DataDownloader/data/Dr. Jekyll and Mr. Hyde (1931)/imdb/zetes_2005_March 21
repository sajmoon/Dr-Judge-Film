I haven't read Stevenson's famous novel, but this film is adapted from
a play which is supposedly a lot different anyway. The story is really
not especially great. A scientist makes a potion that turns him into a
total spazz. The spazz version ruins Dr. Jekyll's romance with Rose
Hobart and tortures a loose woman, played by Miriam Hopkins. The film
turns out to be completely amazing, however, thanks to the lead
performance, by Fredric March, and the elegant direction by Rouben
Mamoulian. Every time I see March in a film, I become more impressed by
his range. Of course, this is a perfect vehicle to demonstrate one's
range, and he excels as both Jekyll and Hyde, though his Hyde is what
most will remember. Looking at his filmography, Mamoulian directed
relatively few films for a director of his era (not to mention talent).
I need to see more, most notably Love Me Tonight, but he will always be
a genius in my book for Queen Christina. His direction of Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde is beautiful and nearly flawless. A lot of the film is
made from the direct point-of-view of Jekyll, and he uses a
first-person technique that works brilliantly. Between March and
Mamoulian, the general silliness of the story is completely made up
for. March's female co-stars, Hopkins and Hobart, are quite good, as
well.
