The early 1930s were truly the golden age of the horror movie. The
scream flicks of this period were not the scariest or the biggest
budgeted, but the era was unique and special in that the monster, the
object of terror was almost always the star. The box office pull and
familiarity of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff was far more significant
than that of Vincent Price or Christopher Lee a few decades later, and
they never had to cede top billing to some dashing male lead or
beautiful heroine. Frederic March was not a horror star, but as Jekyll
and Hyde landed the first Academy Award for a performance in a horror,
in the kind of role that it would later become unthinkable to honour in
this way.<br /><br />This was a very transitional time for acting, particularly with regard
to male leads. The couple of Best Actor winners before this (George
Arliss and Lionel Barrymore) had been of the room-filling theatrical
style that dominated the early talkies, beating the more reserved and
naturalistic style that was slowly evolving. The fifth Academy Awards
were the turning point, when Wallace Beery&#x27;s warmly human turn in The
Champ tied with Fredric March&#x27;s gleeful scenery-chomping in this
picture. Although I prefer Beery, I can see why March was equally
lauded. While his Jekyll is nothing special, competent but still a
little too hammy for a straight role, his Hyde is utterly engaging and
watchable. He differs from the John Barrymore (1920) and Spencer Tracy
(1941) interpretations in that he is not only animalistic but slightly
childlike in his manner. Importantly, he is transformed enough not just
through the make-up but in voice and mannerisms to make him genuinely
appear as a completely different person. March as Hyde also adds the
one genuine note of creepiness to a production that is short on
atmosphere.<br /><br />This adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novella makes several
sweeping changes. The twin love interests of Ivy and Muriel were an
invention for this version, but a more significant difference is in how
the story is revealed. In the book, the tale is told through the eyes
of the lawyer Utterson, who sees his friend Jekyll apparently harassed
and blackmailed by the villainous Hyde, and we do not discover that
they are one and the same until the final chapter. Perhaps because the
concept of Jekyll&#x27;s transformation was fairly well known by this point,
the film relegates Utterson to a minor character, and instead follows
Jekyll on his journey of scientific discovery and his struggle to
control his alter-ego. Hence we lose the sense of mystery that was a
great asset to the novella, but we gain a deep and disturbing insight
into the process.<br /><br />Producer-director Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s aim seems to be to totally immerse
us in the experience of Jekyll and Hyde, and thus employs some of the
most extended and elaborate point-of-view shots ever committed to
celluloid. This is a somewhat hit-and-miss tactic. It makes the first
transformation scene truly exhilarating, but other times it just looks
odd, particularly in the opening scenes, where it quickly turns into a
distracting gimmick. This is the young Mamoulian all over. He paid
absolutely no attention to the established rules of film grammar, had
no sense of subtlety, and seems to have assumed that the more obvious
and complex the technique, the more effective it must be. He sometimes
has good ideas &#x96; for example drawing our attention to the skeleton
shortly before Jekyll downs the potion for the first time, but he has
to do so heavy-handedly with a whip-pan. Perhaps worst of all are those
annoying split-screen moments, one of which actually distracts from one
of the nicest touches in March&#x27;s performance &#x96; his breaking in and out
a run after his transformation in the park.<br /><br />Also, in spite of March&#x27;s success, Mamoulian was generally a poor
director of actors, one of the few coaches who appears to have
encouraged excessive hamming. Miriam Cooper is mediocre, which was
about the most she ever was, and everyone else is bad to the point of
cringeworthy. However Mamoulian did hire the best when it came to
technical crew. The cinematography of Karl Struss brings out the
dinginess of the slums, while we can thank renowned production designer
Hans Dreier for the bright idea of making Jekyll&#x27;s lab a careful blend
of scientific paraphernalia and Gothic architecture.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with this version of Jekyll and Hyde is
that, unlike the classics being produced at Universal, it simply
doesn&#x27;t have the horror genre running through its veins. Prestigious,
highbrow Paramount just didn&#x27;t seem to get the camp creepiness of its
smaller rival. And yet, it is true to the 30s horror form, for ugly and
despicable as Hyde is, he (not Jekyll) is unquestionably the hero.
