1999_April 1 

Slow moving, and the acting of Fredric March, who won an Oscar for best
actor (in a tie with Wallace Beery's performance in &quot;The Champ&quot;) was not
as
impressive as Karloff in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; or Lugosi in &quot;Dracula,&quot;
performances
that were more squarely in the &quot;horror&quot; genre and, therefore, not even
considered by the Academy.  As Hyde, March resembles a monkey in
appearance
and a gorilla or ape in personality.  As Jekyll, he resembles a dozen or
so
other actors from the early days of &quot;talking pictures&quot;:  a little stiff at
times, and wearing too much mascara.  All in all, he's believable enough,
but the only truly exciting moments occur toward the end.  The beast
within is
finally visible without a swig of his little old potion.
