Fredric March was superb and thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar
for this, by far the most exciting and cinematic version of the famous
story. Miriam Hopkins should have been nominated a well for her
excellent portrayal of Ivy Pearson, a London prostitute. Her accent was
so good I wouldn&#39;t have guessed she was born in Georgia. Rose Hobart
was also very good as Jekyll&#39;s fianc&eacute; and Edgar Norten is outstanding
as his butler Poole. There is absolutely nothing at all racist about
March&#39;s transformation into Mr Hyde, as he was supposed to represent
the Neathanderal man. The pace, the brilliant gas lit settings and the
transformation scenes are still extremely impressive. This masterpiece
shows how much better movies would have been without the Hay&#39;s Code.
Unfortunately it was followed by a much inferior, long drawn out 1941
remake with a too old Spencer Tracy, a Swedish Cockney played by Ingrid
Bergman and a typically bland Lana Turner. Stick with this version.<br /><br />10/10.
