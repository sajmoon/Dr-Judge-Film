Of the many movies made of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde based on the novel by
Robert Louis Stevenson, this 1931 version is the best I have ever seen. It
is sometimes referred to as being made in 1932 but actually opened on New
Years Eve 1931. You know you have the right one if it stars Fredric March,
Miriam Hopkins, and Rose Hobart. This horror classic should rank as an equal
to the better known Frankenstein and Dracula movies also made in 1931. The
special effects are great, as are other innovative photographic techniques
that were used. They are impressive even today.  Symbolism is used a lot
throughout the movie both in word and photography. The acting is excellent
and the characters they portray extremely interesting. For it's time this
must have been considered cutting edge. I was lucky enough to get a DVD
which included a special feature of commentary by film historian Greg Mank,
a looney tunes cartoon, Hyde and Hare, and the 1941 version on the other
side. It was one of my better movie purchases. The 1931 version is
exceptional, a must see for any lover of classic horror films. This is a
true classic, don't miss it. <br /><br />
