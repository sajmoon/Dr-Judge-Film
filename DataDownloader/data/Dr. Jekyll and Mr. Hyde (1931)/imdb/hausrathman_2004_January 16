Over seventy years have passed since the initial release of this film, but
the Fredric Marsh version remains the best depiction of this oft-told tale. 
Academy Awards are rarely given to actors for performances in horror films. 
Fredric Marsh won an Oscar for his performance in this film, and deservedly
so.  However, Oscar probably found itself in March's hands more easily than
expected because, unlike the other classic horror films of period, this film
is less a monster movie than a universal examination of the human
heart.<br /><br />The average movie-goer doesn't have to worry too much about tampering in
God's domain by bringing a corpse back to life or have to worry about
someone trying to drive a stake into their heart, but who hasn't found
themselves trying to conform their lusts or desires to socially- accepted
norms.  This film is blatantly sexual for a film of its time in its
motivations.  Jekyll is engaged to be married to a proper young woman played
by Rose Hubert.  His fervent but healthy sexual desire is thwarted by the
woman's father who demands requires a long engagement.  Too much of a
gentlemen to compromise his fiancee, Jekyll is pushed over the edge when he
meets a seductive prostitute named Ivy, Miriam Hopkins.  He then decides to
test his drug which will split him into two individuals, one good enough for
his fiancee, one bold enough to indulge his unbridled lusts.  Unfortunately,
his dark personality, Mr. Hyde, isn't easy put away once
released.<br /><br />Director Rouben Mamoulian deserves considerable credit for the film's
success.  His direction, while not quite as showy as James Whale's direction
on the Frankenstein films, is both effective and inventive.  His use of
subjective camera foreshadowed John Carpenter's steadicam killer in
&quot;Halloween&quot; by forty-seven years.  His use of filters to create the first
transformation is nothing short of amazing.  Too bad he didn't work more in
the genre.<br /><br />A must see in the horror genre.
