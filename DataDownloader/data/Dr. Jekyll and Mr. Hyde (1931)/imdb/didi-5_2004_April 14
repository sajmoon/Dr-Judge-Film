This early talkie takes Stevenson's novella and turns it into a study of the
destruction which comes from animal tendencies taking over human ones -
Jekyll is disturbed by the constant delay of his marriage to Muriel (Rose
Hobart) so he draws out his 'bad' side, Mr Hyde, and goes in destructive
pursuit of good time girl Ivy (Miriam Hopkins).<br /><br />As Jekyll and Hyde, Fredric March is superb, whether as the malevolent and
intense doctor, or the repulsive and debauched reptile he makes himself
become through his dangerous experiments.  It is sexual tension which causes
many of the problems in this pre-Code fantasy; filmed largely in the shadows
of a make-believe London where our hero/anti-hero wanders at will.  The
cinematography is largely beautifully done, especially when shots swoop down
into dark places and focus on the most difficult scenes (for example, those
involving Hopkins).<br /><br />This is an excellent version of the oft-told tale, and Rouben Mamoulian's
direction is spot-on (as it was in his slightly later Queen Christina). 
March deserved his best actor gong for this classic performance/
