Everyone knows the basics of the story (who doesn&#39;t know the story of
Jekyll and Hyde) so any movie adaptation has to do more than tell the
story - it has to draw the viewer in with a fresh or unexpected
approach and it has to have good performances. This classic version of
the story (the first &quot;talkie&quot; version of it) is a marvellous piece of
work on both counts. The story here is crisp and moves along at a good
pace, and director George Mamoulian uses a number of techniques (some
more successful than others - I like the use of shadows, but thought
the closeups of the actors&#39; eyes did little) to keep the story moving.
The story itself was generally exciting and full of very overt sexual
innuendo - surprisingly so for 1931, but wholly appropriate - including
a very brief (split second, in fact) almost topless look at Miriam
Hopkins from the side.<br /><br />The performances here were to me highlighted by Hopkins&#39; outstanding
turn as Ivy Pearson as the unfortunate object of Hyde&#39;s lust. Frederic
March won an Oscar for his performance as Jekyll/Hyde although I
thought his performance quite mixed. As Hyde he was brilliant; as
Jekyll I thought he came across as forced and artificial (although he
does manage to capture Jekyll&#39;s angst over his loss of control over
Hyde). Rose Hobart&#39;s take on Muriel - Jekyll&#39;s love interest - was, I
thought, quite passionless and therefore lacking and together March and
Hobart didn&#39;t create too much of a spark. March&#39;s Hyde make-up was also
a bit over the top. Hyde came across as basically sub-human, looking a
bit like a neanderthal or even a werewolf, with fangs and hairy hands
included (and I thought a bit of a racist statement was being made when
Jekyll&#39;s skin noticeably darkened whenever he transformed into Hyde.)
To me, these aspects of Hyde detracted a bit from the movie.<br /><br />Still, though, even with some of those criticisms I have to say that
this is probably the most enjoyable version of Jekyll &amp; Hyde that I&#39;ve
seen. It&#39;s well worth 8/10.
