FREDRIC MARCH won his first Oscar for DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE and it is
the kind of showy role that usually results in at least an Oscar
nomination. Although he&#39;s a fine actor, this was 1931 and even the best
screen actors had not yet toned down their performances from either the
stage or the silent screen. There are moments when he&#39;s clearly over
the top, by today&#39;s standards, and of course the exaggerated make-up by
Wally Westmore (with the aid of special lighting filters) gives March a
Simian countenance more suitable for a &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; type of
thing.<br /><br />Still, the actor has to be credited with giving a strong performance,
full of athletic leaps as he attempts to get away safely from those
trying to trap him. And it certainly helps that he gets strong support
from MIRIAM HOPKINS as the cabaret singer who is frightened by his Mr.
Hyde personality as well as his gruesome disguise.<br /><br />ROSE HOBART is a strange choice to play the society girl that March is
romantically involved with. She&#39;s even more bland than Lana Turner was
in the MGM version of the &#39;40s, if that is possible. She offers no real
passion to the part or charm and his infatuation with her never seems
plausible. She would go on to play character roles for the bulk of her
career.<br /><br />The mostly British cast does well by the script and the vintage B&amp;W
photography simulating London interiors and exteriors is fine.<br /><br />In the Spencer Tracy/Ingrid Bergman/Lana Turner version, Tracy&#39;s
make-up was never concealing enough--you could always see him beneath
the bushy brows and the jagged teeth. It made you wonder why others
around him didn&#39;t see through to Dr. Jekyll. March has gone to the
opposite extreme, and therein lies the weakness in my opinion. He&#39;s too
much in the other direction.<br /><br />However, having said that, it&#39;s a good enough version of the Stevenson
story in view of the fact that it&#39;s strictly a film of the &#39;30s in
style and performance.
