The creativity of this production is amazing.  The film includes an
extended
first person POV shot at the beginning that would have been almost
impossible at the time.  The creature's make up and the transformation
scenes are really stunning.  I'm still not sure how the transformation was
done.  Crossfades, wipes, and montage (all new techniques at the time) are
used artfully to help tell the story and to give psychological
insights.<br /><br />Technical matters aside, this is an elegant film.  Mamoulian uses parallel
images of several of the actors to create new and interesting connections
between the characters.  Pay special attention to his use of mirrors.  The
hints of spouse abuse and the Freudian theme of the battle of the id and
ego
also make this film a psychologically complex one.  This is one film
adaptation that, at least in some ways, transcends the text upon which it
was based.
