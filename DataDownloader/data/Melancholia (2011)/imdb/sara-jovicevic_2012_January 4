2012_January 4 
At first, I must admit that I was concerned about first chapter, and it
reminded me a little on &#x22;The tree of life&#x22;, so I started to worry that
it will be at the end very disappointing. But, I had given a chance to
Justine and she has blown me away! Btw,I hated her at the begin, and
I&#x27;ve felt sorry for her poor sister. Her mother is also very funny,
almost like that she had known as well what will be at the end! This
film can&#x27;t leave you speechless! I almost started to cry when I&#x27;d seen
her future/ex husband leaving the wedding! And...what more can I say,
You must see this film and after it start to think what you should do
in 2012.
