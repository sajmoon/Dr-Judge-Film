2012_March 19 
I was utterly disappointed when I bought this movie. It is the kind of
movies that survive only because it carries the name Lars von Trier. If
it was directed by someone unknown no one would give it a second
glimpse. I put aside the fact that it is boring. The introduction is so
long as the music (which is wonderful but the credit does not go to von
Trier for this). The story is nonexistent. No insight is given into the
people&#x27;s relationships nor their personalities are elucidated at any
point. I am not a puritan but I see no sense in watching for two
minutes the bride relieving herself on the grass in the yard. Not to
mention the technique. The camera moves and shakes all the time. There
is a reason why all cameras nowadays have image stabilizers, why do we
have to get sick when we are watching people arguing? Indeed there are
some excellent pictures once in a while. But these are rare and
unconnected. Cutting them out and putting them in an album would be
great. Everything in between is just a waste of precious 135 minutes.
