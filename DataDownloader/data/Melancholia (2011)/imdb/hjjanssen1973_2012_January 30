A few years back, I saw Dogville, and I didn&#x27;t particularly like that
movie of Lars von Trier. But if you like his movies, you will love
Melancholia.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie we are present at a wedding, and the
scene feels a bit strange. Justine suffers from a depression, and the
wedding is influenced by her state of mind.<br /><br />A planet called Melancholia is nearing planet earth, and it is feared
it might hit the earth, or it might just fly by. In this back-line
story the family tensions unfold between Justine, her sister (and
husband) and her mother.<br /><br />The movie was carefully made, and I would have to qualify it as a great
movie within its category. But, that is Lars von Trier&#x27;s category, and
that is not really my cup of tea.<br /><br />So, with respect for its quality, I rate it a 7.
