With only the barest of plots and no concept of continuity this is
worse than most high school films with little brothers for extras.
Obviously the directory has no concept of a story board or any device
to maintain any form of continuity. Many cuts look as though they are
mistakes. I truly feel sorry for the actors as they tried to make a
good film but their efforts were completely destroyed during post
production. At $10 for pay-per-view, at least I saved $4 off of theater
prices. Which explains why this was previewed as PPV. It&#x27;s going to
bomb at the theater.<br /><br />Save your money and see something, anything else. This is as complete a
waste of time as I&#x27;ve ever had to endure.
