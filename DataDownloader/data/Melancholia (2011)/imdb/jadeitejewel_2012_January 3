2012_January 3 
Well, I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t intrigued by Melancholia, and I can&#x27;t say
it&#x27;s the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen, but it&#x27;s very much not a
masterpiece. If I had to describe the film&#x27;s methodology, I&#x27;d say that
it was made by a film student who had a great idea and way too much
money to throw at it, with no editorial control. It&#x27;s visually
wonderful, with a prologue that runs like a music video, full of
striking and portentous images, including CGI of the Earth being
smashed into by a smaller planet, so it&#x27;s no spoiler to say you know
this movie is going to end badly. There&#x27;s a rather big clue to this
movie&#x27;s biggest problem - the overblown ego of its writer and director
- in that the movie is titled &#x27;Lars Von Trier&#x27;s Melancholia&#x27;. <br /><br />The movie begins with Part 1, Justine. It all starts well - a little
humour, interesting and realistic family and interpersonal
relationships, the threads of various plot lines - but the humour is
shortlived, the family relationships never clarified or expanded upon,
and many interesting hints are never explored or resolved. Characters
are introduced to be abandoned. We spend hours at Justine&#x27;s wedding and
at the end I couldn&#x27;t say why we&#x27;d bothered. Everything of importance
could have been much more effectively dealt with in a shorter
timeframe. Part 2, Claire, is more gripping and actually has a plot,
but it&#x27;s not enough to redeem the waste of time that is Part 1. Add to
this Von Trier&#x27;s abuse of the viewer with torture by shaky-cam, a
soundtrack that veered wildly from capturing every breath, snort or
scratch to full-blown blasting of Wagner, and some scenes that were
apparently meant to signify something but which don&#x27;t ever clarify
themselves, and you have a terribly frustrating two hours. I&#x27;d also
like to note here that I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews and posts by
people who loved this movie, and as far as I can see they didn&#x27;t
actually even follow the basic narrative - some are saying the tension
at the wedding is because everyone knows Melancholia is on its way to
smash them, but at this point no-one knows this yet. Justine doesn&#x27;t,
contrary to some claims, spot Melancholia as she goes into the
reception - she spots Antares. Later, she notes it&#x27;s gone - which is
because Melancholia has moved in front of it. Frankly, I think if those
who think it&#x27;s so great can&#x27;t even get the narrative correct, then I&#x27;m
justified in disagreeing with their assessment of this film&#x27;s quality.<br /><br />If this were a film by a film student, you&#x27;d say &#x27;Well, these are great
ideas, and you&#x27;ve certainly got a lot to explore here, but you need to
refine your focus, tighten your editing and think more clearly about
what you&#x27;re trying to tell us - and for God&#x27;s sake quit with the shaky
camera stuff&#x27;, but coming from a director with this many films under
his belt, it&#x27;s a terrible mess of egotistic bombast - full of sound and
fury, signifying nothing. <br /><br />The acting is competent, although I&#x27;m not sure why everyone thinks
Dunst is great in this. Her performance is solid but not exemplary; she
plays everything out very heavy-handedly, with no nuance or subtlety at
all. Kiefer Sutherland and Charlotte Gainsbourg do very well,
particularly Sutherland,who I think is the best performance in the
movie. John Hurt makes his brief role look easy, Skarsgard Junior does
a lovely puppy-dog husband, but the fact that Von Trier gets so much
out of his actors doesn&#x27;t redeem the rest of the movie. <br /><br />I was disappointed by this film. It had so much potential. Dogville,
while hardly anyone&#x27;s idea of an enjoyable film, was a truly great work
in terms of execution and effect - trim, sharp, cruel and deeply
disturbing. By comparison Melancholia is a flabby, overblown thing. I
am by no means averse to good art-house, but this is not good anything
- it&#x27;s a great idea ruined by the unlimited self-indulgence of its
director. Watch it if you are interested in puzzling out Von Trier&#x27;s
meanings, or if you just generally like movies that leave you asking
questions, but don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re missing out if you don&#x27;t get to
see it.
