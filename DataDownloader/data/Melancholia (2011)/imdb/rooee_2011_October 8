The Danish auteur&#x27;s latest is a study of depression, and more
specifically suicide. Subtle suicide imagery abounds: a jar of beans
doubles resembles a pot of pills; a child hacks at the wrist of a tree
branch with a knife; a bridge doubles as a gateway of doom. But aside
from metaphor he also faces mental illness head-on, in the relationship
between the catastrophically depressed Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her
caring, resourceful sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg, back in the
ring for another round).<br /><br />The early wedding scenes, in which beaming Justine slowly
self-destructs on her wedding day, are reminiscent of the masterful
Festen (directed by Dogma 95 brother-in-arms Thomas Vinterberg). But
the agenda here is quite different: a prelude to a desperately solemn
second act, where it is never quite clear who is aware that the world
is going to end, who is unaware, and who is in denial. We never move
outside the manor grounds &#x96; does &#x22;the village&#x22; really exist? How much
of this world belongs to Justine&#x27;s dreamworld (brought to life in a
seductive Wagner-scored opening sequence)? Or is the planet Melancholia
some kind of sister to Solaris? Indeed, Von Trier, who dedicated his
previous film to Andrei Tarkovsky, directly references Solaris with his
use of the painting &#x22;Hunters in the Snow&#x22; by Pieter Bruegel. It&#x27;s worth
remembering, also, that Tarkovsky&#x27;s final film, The Sacrifice, focused
on a remote country house, whose wealthy occupants were caring for a
disturbed, melancholic loved one, who may or may not be seeking psychic
consolation by imagining the end of the world. Von Trier doesn&#x27;t quite
match that film&#x27;s bleak humour, but the comparison is valid.<br /><br />Regardless of Lars Von Trier&#x27;s off-screen japery, there&#x27;s no denying he
creates serious, memorable, deeply textured film worlds, each time
squaring the wheels on another Hollywood genre. I think Melancholia
could have done with a more static camera, and a slightly fuller script
(Von Trier&#x27;s skills as a writer shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated). But there
aren&#x27;t many filmmakers who would be willing to make a disaster movie
which is both vaster and more focused and singular than any that have
gone before. With all the dollars and extra dimensions in the universe,
Roland Emmerich could never make us feel such a sense of sadness and
loss.
