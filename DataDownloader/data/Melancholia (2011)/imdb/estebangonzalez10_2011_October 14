&#xA8;Life is only on Earth. And not for long. &#xA8; Melancholia as its name
suggests is a very depressing movie starring Kirsten Dunst and
Charlotte Gainsbourg as two troubled sisters. Danish director Lars von
Trier (Antichrist and Dogville) suffered from depression himself and
decided to use his personal experience and share his emotions with the
viewer in this melancholic film. The story is interesting at some
points and the visuals are really stylish, but I am not a big fan of
these dark, depressing movies so I didn&#x27;t have a pleasant experience.
Lars von Trier wrote the screenplay himself as he usually does with his
work and filmed the movie in Sweden so the scenery is actually quite
beautiful, but the story and characters are too dark for my personal
taste. The film is really slow and consists of two parts, one focusing
on each sister. The long opening scene set the mood for the entire
movie with music from Wagner&#x27;s &#xA8;Tristan and Isolde.&#xA8; You can fall
asleep with how slow the pace is. This is definitely not a movie for
everyone, but those of you who enjoy these depressing movies might have
a good time it thanks to the great visual style and the psychological
study of the characters. I understood the message that the director was
trying to get across, and I actually enjoyed his work in Dogville, but
I just wasn&#x27;t entertained with Melancholia and found time moving so
slowly that the film seemed like it was never going to end. A much
better film dealing with depression that I recommend and also came out
this year is The Beaver starring Mel Gibson. His performance is much
more deserving of recognition than Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s work in this film
for which she won the best actress award in the Cannes Festival.<br /><br />The movie opens with a long eight minute scene where we are introduced
to some of the scenes that occur during the movie in a very artistic
style, like if we were viewing a live painting. We also see how a
planet (which we later learn is called Melancholia) is headed towards
Earth and collides with it. Then the movie begins with the first part
called Justine and it focuses on her (Kirsten Dunst) wedding reception.
She seems happy at first as she kisses her new husband Michael
(Alexander Skarsgard), but we can tell there is something off about
her. She is trying to hide her depression with fake smiles, but she
can&#x27;t take it for long. Her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and
her brother-in-law, John (Kiefer Sutherland), have spent a lot of money
on the wedding reception and are a bit disappointed with the way things
are turning out. Their parents, Dexter (John Hurt) and Gaby (Charlotte
Rampling), who are divorced have a discussion in front of everyone, so
that doesn&#x27;t help either. Justine can&#x27;t keep on pretending to be happy
and all of a sudden tells her boss, Jack (Stellan Skarsgard) that he is
a selfish person, she ignores Michael, and ends up having sex with
Jack&#x27;s nephew, Tim (Brady Corbet). The second part of the story is
titled Claire and it takes place at their residence a couple of months
after the disastrous wedding. Everyone is aware now that a planet seems
to be heading towards Earth, although John (as the scientist he is)
assures them that it will just pass by. Justine&#x27;s depression is getting
worse and worse, but she seems to not care much about the possible
collision. It&#x27;s Claire&#x27;s turn now to suffer anxiety and panic attacks
as she fears for the worst.<br /><br />It&#x27;s interesting to see how von Trier plays out this film, making us
see how unbalanced Justine is at her wedding. Kirsten Dunst captures
her depression really well (although I don&#x27;t think it is Oscar worthy
if you ask me). Then in the second part of the film we see how all of a
sudden the table turns and Justine seems to be the stronger of the two.
Justine goes from needing to being taken care of to caring for her
sister Claire when she can&#x27;t deal with the issue. Even John who seemed
to be always in control ends up taking the easy way out. Lars von Trier
knew exactly what he was doing because suffering from depression
himself he knew that melancholic people tend to deal better under
pressure. Kirsten Dunst really transmits this idea through her
character, but I still think there have been better and more deserving
works this year. I really wasn&#x27;t entertained with this movie, and I
don&#x27;t plan on ever seeing it again. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it, although I
understand all the buzz it is receiving with the critics. The movie was
melancholic, it did its job, but I am just not the kind of guy who is
interested in these movies. I was plain and simply bored with
Melancholia.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/
