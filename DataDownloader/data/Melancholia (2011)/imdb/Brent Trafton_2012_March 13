The difference between a good movie and &#x22;art&#x22; is that you can watch a
good movie and know that it&#x27;s good but &#x22;art&#x22; needs to be explained to
be understood. With that explanation, the film &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; qualifies
as &#x22;art.&#x22;<br /><br />The first 8 minutes are very beautiful and I had hopes that it would be
along the lines of &#x22;Tree of Life.&#x22; But after that, Lars von Trier
resorts to his shaky hand-held camera and clunky dialog that goes
nowhere slowly. The film is hard to look at without getting motion
sick.<br /><br />&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is very frustrating because it uses such good actors and
it looks like it had some good ideas. It is so painful to sit through
that I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is similar to a film called &#x22;Another Earth&#x22; which is a
much better film. Go see that one instead.
