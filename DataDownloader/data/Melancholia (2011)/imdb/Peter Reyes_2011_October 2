This is one of those movies that goes nowhere very slowly. It is very
artsy and has hidden meanings that nobody can uncover. There really is
no true plot. Rather, you can interpret its many isolated scenes to
mean whatever you want. The first hour seems so unconnected to the rest
of the movie. The last half is even more frustrating because it just
doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. There really isn&#x27;t much character development.
Everything you need to know about the characters could have been summed
up within a 5 minute scene. No depth. No explanations.<br /><br />Basically, its a confusing movie that nobody seems to want to say they
had no idea what was going on after watching it so they just say, &#x22;That
was a nice movie,&#x22; so that they don&#x27;t look stupid.
