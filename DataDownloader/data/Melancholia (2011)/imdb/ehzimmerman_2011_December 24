Well, it is true I was mesmerized throughout this film, and its impact
on me, both profoundly disturbing and lovely, still lingers. The cast
is fabulous; I always enjoy when the Charlottes (Rampling and
Gainsbourg) act in anything. I don&#x27;t know what to compare with this
one- of-a-kind film. The journey of the planet &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; and the
characters&#x27; reactions to it, is shown in beautiful, frightening and
unforgettable ways. Now that I&#x27;ve praised &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; I&#x27;ll say I
can&#x27;t honestly recommend it. For one thing, the overall message is
depressing. It&#x27;s scary, nihilistic and cynical, and unsuitable viewing
for sensitive souls prone to nightmares. Who needs to suffer through
two+ hours of an overwhelming dose of reality filtered through such a
dark lens? If director Lars Von Trier&#x27;s goal was to share his personal
world view, then I feel sorry for him. Following the opening montage of
images, my boyfriend Joe said out loud, in a hopeful tone of voice,
&#x22;The End!&#x22; In fact, you can pretty much glean the main gist of the film
from its non-verbal prologue. Still, despite all my caveats and
complaints, I understand why some folks gave this film ten stars and
rave reviews.
