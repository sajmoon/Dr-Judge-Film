First of all, let me start out with a question: Are the conversations
in the real day-to-day life of director Lars von Trier always boring,
unnatural and filled with painful silences? If not, why are the
dialogues in Melancholia always boring, strangely unnatural and filled
with painful silences??? I am puzzled.<br /><br />Secondly, I must say that the acting in Melancholia is very good.
Despite the lack of convincing dialogues. Kirsten Dunst is stunning.<br /><br />The setting and photographie are also outstanding. Despite the lack of
a probable story.<br /><br />The music is well chosen.<br /><br />The wobbling of the camera is also unequaled, as is the improbability
of the script.<br /><br />Adds all this up to a good movie? Not at all! Melancholia is the kind
of art-house movie that agonizes you all the way through it. Despite an
original opening scene, and a very original subject, being the vicinity
of a blue planet about to hit Earth (why doesn&#x27;t anybody mention this
&#x27;detail&#x27; in part 1, the wedding??? (I wreck my brain))<br /><br />In short, it is not the kind of movie you&#x27;d watch if you knew the end
of the world was coming.
