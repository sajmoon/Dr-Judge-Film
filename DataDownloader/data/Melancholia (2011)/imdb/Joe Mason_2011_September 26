I do like Lar&#x27;s von Trier&#x27;s unique take on film and life in general,
however, I also understand why others might not. But this is a film
where he invites everyone to the party. Albeit an ostentatious wedding
party that is undermined by a bipolar bride who infects her loved ones
and the viewer but sucks us in all the same and then flips us on our
heads by validating depression in the most beautiful way. What this is
is a great apocalyptic film which explores humanity like no other &#x27;end
of the world&#x27; film has ever actually done which is surprising
considering the amount of those films out there. Say what you want
about this guy, he has his finger on YOUR pulse. <br /><br />His film&#x27;s know us. You can&#x27;t hide.
