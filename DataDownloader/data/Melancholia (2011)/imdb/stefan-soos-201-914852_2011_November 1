Saw the movie yesterday and still feel a bit wishy-washy about it. Now
Van Trier creates some incredible images, a unique mood and a couple of
really funny scenes but in the end it feels like the work of well...a
melancholic man who didn&#x27;t have the power to finish his job properly.
Especially the 2nd part feels kind of empty, now some might argue thats
the melancholia and the intention of the director but too me it felt
just uninspired. But most of all i disagree with many reviewers about
the acting performances. Dunst is in no way bad in this but in the end
she is a bit too Hollywood and doesn&#x27;t carry the movie in the way
Kidman did or Emily Watson or even the non-acting Bjork.
Dunst-Gainsbourg-Sutherland rarely create that natural
dogme-documentary feeling you get/got at other Van Trier movies. Kind
of lame were the Tarkovsky references, its obviously some kind of joke
by LvT but after 40 years of vT doing it doesn&#x27;t even work as a joke
for me anymore. But in the end its still a movie i would recommend,
simply because if its aesthetics and the unique feeling it transports.
