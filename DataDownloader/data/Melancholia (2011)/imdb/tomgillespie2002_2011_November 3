I wrote a review for Lars Von Triers previous film, Antichrist (2009),
so I won&#x27;t reiterate his &#x27;agent-provocateur&#x27; profile outside of his
films. I also have to confess that I&#x27;ve never really been much of a fan
of his work. The aforementioned, I found intriguing, The Idiots (1998)
was OK. Other than Breaking the Waves (1996 - which whilst utterly
depressing, was a fine film), I can&#x27;t say that his films have
enlightened me in any way. His approach has always been interesting
though. Now to his most recent effort. Melancholia, whilst forming
around the concept that a planet (Melancholia) is heading towards
Earth, the film is largely focused upon the relationship between
siblings Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who
are, emotional, polar opposites. The film is split into two chapters,
each with the sister&#x27;s names as titles.<br /><br />The first half focuses on Justine, and specifically her wedding
reception. This part of the film plays much like another of the Dogma
&#x27;95 films, Thomas Vintererg&#x27;s excellent Festen (1998). We are
introduced to Dunst&#x27;s character as someone fleeting. She constantly
leaves the party, sporadically moving around outside of family and
friends. We know from this that she is without conscience when
considering people around us. We see in this section that Justine is a
person attracted to chaos; she despises order. This is perfectly
illustrated in a scene in the bridal suit, where coitus is about to
take place. Her new husband, Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), begins
taking his clothes of, folding each element of garment and carefully
laying them down. This show of order seems to frighten Justine, as she
leaves.<br /><br />In chapter two, the main focus is on the sister, Justine. She has a
seemingly austere life, married to John (Kiefer Sutherland) with a
young son. They stay in what seems to be a manor house. Justine, who is
now staying with them in the throws of deep depression. Claire, unlike
Justine, is petrified with any form of disorder. All things have to be
in the right place. From the start of the film the presence of the
approaching planet is referred to. As it gets ever closer Claire&#x27;s
husband constantly reminders her that it will most certainly not impact
with Earth. The film progresses as each character comes to terms with
their existence in the face of utter destruction.<br /><br />A drama which alludes to science fiction, it is an interesting film on
two very different people living with the idea of total destruction. It
is without question an utterly beautiful piece of cinema, with some
exceptionally great performances, particularly from Dunst, in what must
be her finest role.<br /><br />www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
