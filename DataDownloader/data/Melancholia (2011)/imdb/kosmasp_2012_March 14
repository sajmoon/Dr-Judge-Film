There is a reason the movie is called &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;. There is also a
reason why Kirsten Dunst mood changes. If you are paying attention
there won&#x27;t really be a surprise towards the end. Only surprise being
that the characters themselves didn&#x27;t think of it. And don&#x27;t watch it,
just for the &#x22;flesh&#x22;.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst delivers a power house performance. And the other actors
are good too. I was still missing something. I liked the movie (and I
can tell you there weren&#x27;t that many in the cinema I watched it, who
actually liked it) and I could see the allegories and everything Lars
v. Trier was trying to convey. Still thought the break (it&#x27;s kind of
like watching two different movies back to back) didn&#x27;t really work
that well in my opinion. Some of course will just like it, because it&#x27;s
different. That&#x27;s OK too, just be sure to know what you let yourself
into.
