Just saw one of the worst movies ever. Or part of it, anyway...
Melancholia with Kirsten Dunst. I left the theater after the first
fifteen minutes because the shaky hand-held video closeups in every
shot were making me nauseous and head achy and my eyes are now achy
from fatigue. My husband also left feeling nauseous. Yecch... don&#x27;t
waste your money! Fortunately, I was able to get a free pass to return
to the Pickford Film Center in the future to see a different film at no
cost to me. Even if the film hadn&#x27;t been so visually obnoxious and
disturbing, the depressing plot wasn&#x27;t worth my time or money, either.
Never again will I see a movie by this writer, director.
