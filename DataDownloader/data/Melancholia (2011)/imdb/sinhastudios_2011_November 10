Everyone is white.<br /><br />That&#x27;s my only complaint. Otherwise, pretty solid stuff. Kirsten Dunst
plays a weak character with much resolve. She plays off of Charlotte
Gainsbourg in the first half, and the roles switch in the second. I
found the beginning of the film to be lengthy, but necessary. The third
act will leave you feeling trapped with the characters, and it is
harrowing. The set location is stunning, and I believe it is where
parts of X-Men First Class was filmed? There is nudity so don&#x27;t bring
your kids. In its entirety this film somewhat reminds me of Tarsem
Singh&#x27;s The Fall since it looks like the director wishes he was a
painter. You will leave the theater feeling sadder and more fatalistic
than usual.
