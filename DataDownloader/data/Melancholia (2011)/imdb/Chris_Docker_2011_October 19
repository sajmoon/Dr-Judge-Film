What is the one thing of which you are most certain?. . . certain
beyond your wildest dreams? your worst nightmares? Justine is getting
married. A wonderful wedding. Best wedding planner. And as she lifts
her head to enjoy the kisses of her groom we sense the sparkle of love
entering what almost might be a world of darkness. Kirsten Dunst comes
of age as an actress in this finely sculptured character as a
successful career woman, enjoying a magnificent day in all its finery,
where no expense has been spared. Yet somehow we can sense, in this
beautifully interiorised performance, that the tinsel of the outer
world means little to Justine. It is not that she is some new-age
unmaterialistic hippy: on the contrary, her powerful mind commands a
high salary as a tagline creator for a powerful advertising concern.<br /><br />The truth is that Justine suffers from clinical depression. A disease
with which our director, Lars von Trier, is also afflicted. Yet does
the film tell us how depressing the world is and ask us to feel sorry
for its leading protagonist? Not at all. While von Trier has used his
own experience to create a vivid reconstruction that goes beyond
sympathy or melodrama, the film is ultimately a celebration of
Justine&#x27;s strength and inner clarity. Her non-attachment to the
trappings of happiness &#x96; things in which most people would seem to find
such joy &#x96; is almost Zen-like in its conviction. Why do we go to such
lengths to find meaning in transitory and superficial
sense-gratification? Love, the deep and wonderful communication of one
person with another, can&#x27;t be bought or bartered. Yet we spend our
lives building castles of sand &#x96; even as expressions of &#x27;love&#x27; &#x96; and if
Justine can&#x27;t have the real thing in each touch, she certainly doesn&#x27;t
want to settle for lust dressed up in lace.<br /><br />Von Trier is becoming increasingly operatic in his films. The theme
music from Wagner&#x27;s Tristan and Isolde, both as a soundtrack and, by
implication, the doomed love it&#x27;s saga represents, is a perfect setting
for this grand vision of life and meaning. The leitmotif reminds us
that, beneath everything, there is a more serious theme at work. If
death is the only real certainty of life, this is symbolically
illustrated in the second half of Melancholia. For someone who is
deeply depressed, death is a mere detail. But for others, it is the
worst of all possible eventualities. To get the point across in the
most vivid way, and also show how Justine&#x27;s illness gives her a
strength denied ordinary mortals, von Trier turns his film into an
end-of-the-world movie. A rogue planet (aptly named Melancholia)
hurtles through space and, having narrowly missed some of the other
planets, is on a collision course for Earth. As the actual collision
has been previewed in the film&#x27;s opening scenes, we already know that
last minute intervention (for instance, to save the earth
Hollywood-style) is not likely.<br /><br />As supporting characters struggle, and eventually lose the battle to
convince themselves that everything is OK, Justine warmly embraces the
development. There are two nude scenes &#x96; when one might say that our
heroine is not only naked but that her soul is stripped bare. One is
when her sister, trying to care for a &#x27;mentally unbalanced&#x27; Justine, is
trying to persuade her to have a bath. The wretchedness of her sorrow
is profound: having endured the symbolic show of an overblown wedding
reception, she has lost the one thing that meant something to her. It
is stark contrast to her self-assured second half of the film, where
her calmness is like something I have occasionally witnessed in gently
smiling hospice patients (who know they are about to die). The second
instance is more beautiful, although completely unglamorised. As other
characters swither between denial, fear and bravado (&#x22;Let&#x27;s have a
glass of wine outside&#x22;), Justine calmly enjoys the epiphany.
Identifying with the earth about to meet its nemesis, she bares herself
to the onslaught of the coming planet in a gesture that finds her
sprawled in adoration on a hillside.<br /><br />Von Trier&#x27;s controversial furore at the film&#x27;s Cannes premiere ensured
wider distribution than might otherwise be expected for an art-house
offering as dark as Bunuel. This maybe misleads some people into seeing
a film with the false expectation of something more mainstream. As one
teenager exclaimed, walking out of the multiplex screening I went to,
&#x22;I&#x27;ve never sat through such gash in my whole life.&#x22; But to cinephiles
more attuned to von Trier&#x27;s style of filmmaking, it probably represents
his greatest triumph since Dogville. One could even imagine allusions
to Justine&#x27;s name with the eponymous novel of de Sade, an abused
protagonist who accepts approaching death. Raw, original and
uncompromising, yet also a work of uplifting beauty, Melancholia is an
end-of-the-world movie the likes of which you have never seen before.
