Lars Von Trier&#x27;s latest film MELANCHOLIA got the media attention it
needed when Von Trier, in Cannes doing a press conference, stated that
he sympathized with Hitler. Now sure, one can look at this as a smart
way of marketing one&#x27;s own film, or one can start wondering what kind
of guy Von Trier has become. As a filmmaker he&#x27;s certainly interesting,
and certainly self-indulging, and as a child of the late Bergman, he
loves dwelling upon women in a somewhat sad state of mind. MELANCHOLIA
is a dark film that doesn&#x27;t have the explicitness of his controversial
ANTICHRIST, but brings in just the same dark undercurrents of human
beings who&#x27;s lost their touch with love, compassion, faith and hope,
and so we find them in the land of Trier where things will become
increasingly intense and frightful. The story is told in two parts; in
the first we find the deeply depressed Kirsten Dunst on her wedding
day, which shot and felt much like Vinterberg&#x27;s Dogme-film &#x27;Festen&#x27;,
and part two interests Dunst&#x27;s sister Charlotte Gainsbourg more into
the story along with her husband and son, as staying at a beautiful
mansion in the countryside sees the enormous planet Melancholia headed
for Earth, fearing for all of humanity to end. One can certainly see
this film with two different kind of goggles; Melancholia IS a planet
that&#x27;s headed for Earth, and it&#x27;s doomsday - or, one can see the heavy
symbolism of Melancholia as a state of mind, swallowing the family with
its meaninglessness. Director Von Trier keeps most questions open, and
by using some absolutely mesmerizing camera-work the film beholds a
interesting quality and sensibility. Few if any other popular directors
anno 2011 creates stuff the way Von Trier does, and the immense climax
accompanied by Wagner music is sole alone worth the watch. I guess Von
Trier makes personal films, and he claims himself to be the best living
director in the world, and he wants a green card into everyone&#x27;s lives
and with MELANCHOLIA he again sows some disturbing and heavy-handed
seeds - and if anything, he makes your mind wobble. Must see.
