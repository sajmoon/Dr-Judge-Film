Lars Von Trier is a film-maker whose work goes without definition; he&#x27;s
the kind of artist that defies what the mainstream may consider to be
the proper and appropriate way to present a narrative, yet somehow
still manages to find himself at the talking end of press and internet
blogs the world over. The explanation is simple; Trier makes films that
take the basic premises of modern cinema and tip them on their head,
exposing secrets we never quite saw before, and in turn capturing the
attention of movie-goers either through disgust, ambivalence or
enlightenment. So whether you find the man&#x27;s work to be refreshing or
just downright indulgent, there&#x27;s probably a part of your argument
that&#x27;s completely correct; and that, I guess, is what makes his films
so often the talking points of any film-festival or internet forum.<br /><br />Melancholia (which is coming to theatres now in amongst the dark dreary
shadow of perhaps Von Trier&#x27;s most publicized work to date, Antichrist)
has big boots to fill but will once again no doubt have audiences who
manage to sit through the undeniably stark and barren film at odds with
how they feel towards it. Part requiem for planet Earth, part
character- study and analysis on chronic depression and the acceptance
of our mortality, Melancholia is very much just as dismaying as the
bleak and horrifying Antichrist was, but in a much more subtle manner.
And while the overarching plot revolves around a flyby planet that is
destined to destroy the Earth and everyone on it, Von Trier never once
divulges in the fantastic&#x97;instead he subjects the viewer to the
mundane; the crawling, agonising, polarising, sometimes exhilarating
viewpoint of his central character Justine who is played by an
astoundingly muted Kristen Dunst.<br /><br />What results is a film that is understatedly emotive, in a manner which
is overwhelmingly bleak. Conceived during a severe bout of depression
that Trier experienced prior to the production, one can easily digest
where the darkness of Melacholia comes from and how instead of coming
across as a bloated, indulgent essay on the condition, the film-maker
acknowledges the sometimes serene, and calm qualities that can be
distilled in a depressed mind during times of crisis. Justine, who
begins the film getting married, cheats on her new husband on a golf
course, quits her job soon after and then laments her loneliness all in
the one night, might not be the most understandable or empathetic of
characters, but we&#x27;re never meant to feel sorry for her&#x97;on the contrary
we see her as she is, as troubled, hard to deal with but yet still with
a sense of integrity and intelligence. Which is why, when the movie
comes to its strikingly bombastic halt, we&#x27;re surprised to find that
it&#x27;s probably Justine that we would hope to be, should the curtain come
crashing down on us.<br /><br />How Von Trier achieves this is part of what makes Melancholia a treat;
despite its tendencies to overdo and prolong the mundane. It&#x27;s a
complex and often very sharp, precise and punctuating discourse on the
ever- looming prospect of death that awaits each and every one of us.
What Melancholia does is explore how different characters react or deal
with the realisation that, yes, death is coming, so how are you going
to deal with it? What kind of person are you? The result is startling,
and for a movie that depicts the end of the world with no quarrel; no
reservations; the final bullet point is a refreshingly conclusive one,
which in this day and age is hard to come by. So if at all you find
anything to appreciate about Melancholia, it will probably be just
that&#x97; that it has something to say, and it does so without compromise.
It may be depressing, and it may be a tad dull and dreary, but when
you&#x27;re dealing with manic depression and the end of the world, what do
you really expect? Independence Day? If so; give it a miss. If not,
then you might just be surprised at what you find within yourself as
you join Justine and company as they stare into the fading light of
their mortality.
