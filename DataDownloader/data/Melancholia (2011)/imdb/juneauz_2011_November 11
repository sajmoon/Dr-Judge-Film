Loved every second of it. Intense, visually stunning, true in its
complexity, with an amazing, rewarding final. I don&#x27;t think I can
praise it enough. The first sequence is a passionate tribute to
Tarkovskij, but not without a meaning: it displays immediately where
the movie is heading to, a pact with the audience that amplifies so
much the climax throughout the movie. You know what&#x27;s coming... you
just can&#x27;t stop it, like pessimism itself. The acting from both Dunst
and Gainsbourg deserves applause, maybe even awarding, but in a movie
like this you can&#x27;t separate the actors from the master behind it: with
his photography and his timing, the director amplifies every small
sentence with new meaning, adding more levels to the naked script.
Mystery, love, anger are hidden behind whispered words just like a
small planet is hidden behind the sun. There&#x27;s so much you can learn
from this movie, and learning has never been so beautiful. Thank you
Lars Von Trier.
