I finally watched LvT&#x27;s Melancholia. After the disaster that was
Antichrist (and not bc of the nudity or gore but it being a bad movie
overall) I was scared. Glad to hear he&#x27;s not lost it (by it, I don&#x27;t
mean his mind, which remains firmly lost, but his ability to do his
thing).<br /><br />Melancholia is good. It moves like molasses in the first half and it
will irritate some people bc of that. I had little interest in Justine
after I got her character in the first half hour. The second half was
much better for me. You have to suspend disbelief about pretty much
everything - don&#x27;t seek logic. I mean a star hiding behind the sun,
bigger than the moon is approaching earth and there are no tsunamis and
somehow all the world&#x27;s scientists were wrong about it etc. It&#x27;s not a
tightly scripted sci-fi movie. It&#x27;s more a meditation. This may delight
or annoy, depending on your perspective.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot in depressing grey northern European
light. The opening sequence (very pretty a la Antichrist) is set to
Wagner, very fittingly. The &#x22;happy&#x22; ending is the best part and is
worth the wait.<br /><br />As for the acting, I was not impressed, unlike most reviews here. You
have to suspend disbelief again that these people are related. The
sisters just did not have sister chemistry at all. And of course don&#x27;t
ask why one sister is a garden variety American and the other a
foreigner with an accent. Gainsbourg is pretty much the same woman she
plays in all her movies. It&#x27;s OK. I might be in the minority in not
liking Dunst in this. All she did was remain expressionless most of the
time and show off her new breasts occasionally. Acting chops not
needed. I was thinking with someone who could bring some zing into the
existential pain of the Justine character (Naomi Watts?) it would&#x27;ve
been better. But sounds like the brain-dead zombie Dunst was working
for others.<br /><br />The movie was heavy handed in quite a few places. When done well, it&#x27;s
easy to forgive. But some of it just was weak (all the scenes with the
little boy for example were neither touching nor well done - and is
that a self-indugent alter ego for the poor mother-needy Lars?). <br /><br />Melancholia does not nearly approach some of LvT&#x27;s earlier and
innovative work but it is promising in comparison to Antichrist. The
movie could have been a lot better by better editing and better acting.
It was quite uneven, with moments of greatness mixed in with stretches
of mediocrity.<br /><br />LvT has always been a &#x22;different&#x22; individual and is apparently dealing
with additional mental health issues on top of his usual neuroticism.
While I am relieved that his just-post-midlife-crisis doesn&#x27;t mean more
junk like Antichrist, I hope he can harness the angst and anger a bit
more deftly in the future.
