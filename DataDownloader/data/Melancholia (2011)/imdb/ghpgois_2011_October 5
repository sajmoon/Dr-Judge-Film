In all philosophical perspective I&#x27;d like to write a few words about
this movie.<br /><br />It guides us into some kind of inversion. It&#x27;s a process in which comes
in and then comes out and vice-versa &#x96; an IMpression versus DEpression.
I mean that the real point is &#x96; despite the obvious macrocosmos and
microcosmos perspective &#x96; the complete equivalence of &#x22;forms&#x22; running
side-by-side and in unison. What we realize, going straight to the
point, is a vertiginous gazing, a one of a kind vision that we don&#x27;t
want to face or we&#x27;re too afraid to do so. Von Trier&#x27;s magnificent work
is perfect into what he wants to express and It certainly forces us
into this deep anguish and anxiety. It takes us nervous because it&#x27;s
the point he wants to hit &#x96; we can see it through the camera movements.
&#x22;Vertigo&#x22; is the word for this &#x22;Sartrean&#x22; nauseating reality: the
freedom amid the nothingness, the insignificance of life in contrast
with a whole infinite universe and the anguish before an inescapable
fate. All of this may pass through the viewer&#x27;s heart and I&#x27;m sure It
is the core of this beautiful piece of Von Trier&#x27;s work.
