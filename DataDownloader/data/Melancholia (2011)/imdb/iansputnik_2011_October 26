Was everyone who gave this a 7+ rating watching another film? If I ever
meet the director I&#x27;m going to ask for the 2 1/4 hours of my life that
he stole. After watching this I was hoping that his house gets hit by a
falling planet. The lead character is a poor little rich girl who you
want to slap to get her to buck up. Not sure how they got so many stars
to appear in this drab, depressing, boring drama. It revolved around a
wedding day reception full of well to do people. The bride obviously
isn&#x27;t that keen about getting married. There&#x27;s a planet that is
hurtling towards earth, but the experts say that it&#x27;ll miss. That&#x27;s
about it. How can anyone make a film with a planet heading towards
earth as boring as this is a real mystery to me. Maybe I&#x27;ll try
watching it stoned to see if that changes my perception of it. Then
again, maybe I won&#x27;t.
