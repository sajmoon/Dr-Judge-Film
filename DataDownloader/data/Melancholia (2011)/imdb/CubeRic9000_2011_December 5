As Melancholia&#x27;s closing credits begin to roll, nobody moves. You all
wait for the customary credit music to start up, which it eventually
does after a lengthy silence, and then breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe
because making noise and exiting is now a real possibility, but
honestly, it&#x27;s more in response to having just taken in an intense and
highly cinematic closing shot.<br /><br />Melancholia is an emotionally engaging and profound experience. Since
those closing credits rolled, I have gone from just liking this film,
to appreciating the true scope of it, and as a result, have a strong
desire to see it again very soon. It&#x27;s an appreciation that has come
about through reflection, considering the challenging theme it chooses
to tackle, and the unique story with which it uses as a platform.
Having never seen a Lars Von Trier film before, I had no preconceived
expectation on style or substance. But after reading a short synopsis
that sounded intriguing, and even more so, being drawn in by such an
ethereal yet beautifully surreal poster, it became a must see.<br /><br />The film opens with a stunning sequence that is set in the story&#x27;s near
future, and could be seen as somewhat of a spoiler for the film&#x27;s main
drama, that being the threat that a planet may collide with Earth. But
as this is far from your average end of the world movie, it works to
enhance the narrative that follows. The sequence is a few shots, slowed
right down to almost frozen moments in time, letting one&#x27;s eyes drift
through each image, much like a painting. These shots draw similarities
to other film&#x27;s this year which have shown nature at its most dynamic.
But with this there is purpose, you feel the engagement, as you realise
the event, and watch the tragedy at its peak, whilst being in awe of
the spectacle and the enchanting way it has been composed.<br /><br />From here the film is presented in two parts, each titled after the two
sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).
Part one of the film focuses on Justine, and her wedding day, before
the threat of a planet hitting Earth has been discovered. Claire and
her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) have put a tremendous amount of
effort and money into Justine&#x27;s wedding day, yet at the reception the
bride struggles to remain happy and interested in the formalities. What
is not immediately noticeable but becomes evident, is that Justine
suffers from depression, and Kirsten Dunst plays it out perfectly.
Putting on a fake smile, and pretending like nothing&#x27;s wrong, even
though it can&#x27;t really be hidden. She is a soul lost in the illness.
Cleverly the film presents depression without it becoming the focal
point. It almost has an affective presence on the narrative, like it
does a person, draining the story of its ability to be happy with all
things perfect.<br /><br />For the second part of the film, the imminent threat of a planet
hitting and destroying Earth, becomes the centerpiece of the story, and
is played out on a such a personal level, that it is very affecting.
Claire becomes the focus, as she lives with John, her son, and a sick
Justine, in a cottage on its own golf course, some distance from the
local town. The isolation that is created by the location, means the
outside world is somewhat non-existent. It is just four people, all
with their own fears and emotional instabilities, reacting in entirely
contrasting ways, to what could be the end of their life. It becomes a
character study of sorts, as the human reaction is amplified, by the
isolated circumstances. It uniquely made the threat so much more real,
as the clich&#xE9; of doom and gloom news reports, and shots of worldwide
panic, were omitted, or probably never considered. It was so refreshing
and added so much to the reality of the situation.<br /><br />Melancholia is a highly ambitious film. It portrays the quiet suffering
that is mental illness in a very real and damaging way, accompanying it
with an end of the world scenario that can&#x27;t help but be taken very
seriously. Somehow, Lars Von Trier has been able to juxtapose two
completely different topics together, so it is a seamless cohesion. It
is a sad film no doubt, but it seems to simply represent a type of life
that really exists. A life where things may be achievable, but a mental
illness such as depression holds one back. The end of the world
scenario facing a character suffering depression, brought to the fore
the very real fact, that for no apparent reason, some people live far
from enjoyable lives, that cruelly so it seems, are cut short before
having any chance of improving. It&#x27;s a subject that may be tough to
watch, but is worth recognising, and in this film, feels so real. Best
of all, it will have you thinking on numerous levels come the close.
