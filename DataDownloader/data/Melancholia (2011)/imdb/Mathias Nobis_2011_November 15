Okay, you know after 2 min it&#x27;s LvT. I have nothing bad to say about
this first minutes, they are beautiful pictures. About the acting:
Dunst is good but I don&#x27;t believe her. It&#x27;s seems she&#x27;s using that
natural dull face of hers during the whole movie....so not impressed
(but who am I). Like Gainsbourg in Antichrist, liked her in this movie,
that&#x27;s all I have to say. The Story: Okay, I&#x27;m student. The English
translation of my study would be something like &#x22;the science of
theater, film and media&#x22;. After I saw the film I felt stupid! Because I
didn&#x27;t get it! Not a clue what that so called genius LvT wanted to tell
us. So that&#x27;s the reason I give this movie 2 stars. I just can&#x27;t
recommend a movie that makes absolutely no sense to me. If you get the
movie, I&#x27;m open to answers.
