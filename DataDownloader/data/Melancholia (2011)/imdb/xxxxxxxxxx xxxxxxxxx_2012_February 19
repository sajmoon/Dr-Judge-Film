Is is a bird? Is it a plane? Is it the superman? No, it&#x27;s the super
shaky Yellow Melancholia!<br /><br />Cinema is, more than anything else, image. On that, oh God, what an
atrocious, dreadful, abominable, shockingly bad,execrable, heinous
camera-work in &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;.<br /><br />I did try but I couldn&#x27;t watch the whole film. I am no stranger to von
Triers films and I liked some of his films, like &#x22;Dogville, for
example. But, despite of my interest in the film, I just couldn&#x27;t get
past the heinous camera-work. I am not an expert but I read that they
filmed &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; with one of those small cameras that are also used
to film weddings and birthday parties. They are completely automatic
and any 15 years old teenager experienced with a mobile phone could
have filmed &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;.<br /><br />Of course, you can do a good film with that kind of wedding video
camera and the excellent &#x22;Kreuzer Sonata&#x22; is an example of that. You
can also be able to follow a story where the camera makes sharp, fast
movements and the seminal NYPD Blue is an example of that. But the
camera-work of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is just lousy, nothing else.<br /><br />What I saw in &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; were jerky, wobbly, shaky camera movements.
Many times images were blurred, out of focus and many times you see
images of people&#x27;s backs or the like because the camera is constantly
going from point A to B for no good reason but the sake of movement. To
add insult to injury, the images are yellow! It is not that they
treated the images to look like that. They are yellow when it is bright
and brown when it is dark, what makes easy to see that they didn&#x27;t use
special effects to make the image to look that yellow. It was just
lousy, lazy camera-work.<br /><br />I fast forwarded most of the film, thinking that maybe things would
change but the jerky, shaky, wobbly camera work was always there. The
images were yellow or brown...<br /><br />Imagine that the director is an unknown person, someone whose ordinary
life doesn&#x27;t make headlines of tabloids . Would people really take so
much notice and be so enthusiastic about &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;?<br /><br />Lars von Triers has become a brand, like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.
They can do no wrong, no matter what utter rubbish they do. If any of
them spits on the floor there will be critics surrounding the area and
taking pictures of the genial idea of spitting on the floor and its
multiple layered meanings, its intensity and depth that so contribute
to modern art and world peace.<br /><br />Many people who are &#x22;in&#x22; will look down to the ones who &#x22;didn&#x27;t get the
film&#x22;. It is pathetic because they criticise mass audiences but behave
no different from a herd of cattle and can&#x27;t see the farce of
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; because they are blinded by Lars von Triers shining name.
On the other hand, it makes sense that many people will be sincerely
enthusiasticabout &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; because they are part of the dumbing
down culture of youtube videos and mediocre singers like Madonna, who
was praised by Lars von Triers in an interview...<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t expecting a linear story or a completely static camera. I
watched many good films that had none of that. But the cinematography
of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; with its yellow images, shaky movements and out of
focus images is so shabby that it ruins the film.<br /><br />I think that there are two main reasons for the acceptance of the lousy
cinematography of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;: 1. Most people have a mobile phone
with video camera. The abundance of bad images on youtube is probably
making people more and more comfortable with bad images, as they are
all &#x22;filmmakers&#x22; doing really bad images that they think are wonderful.
2.Internet and other new technologies (such as video games) are making
many people, especially young people, to suffer from short span of
attention.<br /><br />One third and minor reason would be that most enthusiastic reviewers
watched this film in the cinema, instead of watching it on bluray disc
as I did. A cinema screen is far more forgivable than a TV screen and
it is possible that the shabby camera-work of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; didn&#x27;t look
so unbearably shaky on the big cinema screen. Besides, when people
watch a film in the cinema they experiment a &#x22;magic&#x22; that just doesn&#x27;t
exist when they watch the film at home.<br /><br />The farce of this film starts with the prelude to Tristan and Isolde.
Just about any images in slow motion will seem to be fantastic whilst
you are listening to the sheer beauty of Wagner&#x27;s music. Actually, the
only genuine and modern art in this film is Wagner&#x27;s music. Music that
premiered about 150 years ago, before internet, mobile phones and Lars
von Triers.<br /><br />PS I browsed through some of the five stars reviews and the word
&#x22;stunning&#x22; was used more than once to describe the cinematography. I
think there are two ways to explain why reviewers considered visually
stunning a film where the camera movements are so wholly, where so many
images are out of focus and where the images are either yellow or
brown: 1. They watched the film in the cinema, where the super shaky
camera is not so distracting and the images were, I guess, not yellow.
2. They did watch the film on disc or the images are also yellow in the
cinema. In this case, they probably found this film visually stunning
because they are so used to the visual garbage they watch in youtube
that they really lost, if they ever had, any reference of what a really
stunning cinematography is.
