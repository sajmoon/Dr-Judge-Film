All the pros and cons everybody here bitches about this movie are
pretty much worthless when you understand the film and the ultimate
fate of everything. I&#x27;m not even criticizing anybody for doing that;
this is, after all, a forum to discuss movies, so complaining about
that would be stupid. This is a recommendation to those who have not
seen it: Go and watch it, but do it with the expectation of watching a
piece of art, not an enjoyable movie experience. Don&#x27;t try to analyze
what the causes the characters to behave like they do; don&#x27;t expect
plot twists; don&#x27;t wait for bright revelations about secrets or other
intrigues; don&#x27;t expect a story cut down and served for fast
consumption, life is not like that, and this movie is more like life.
Most of all, don&#x27;t expect a happy ending. Enjoy the film like you would
enjoy your favourite painting, or classical music. Enjoy the ride and
don&#x27;t hope for its ending. It is a long movie, but every minute adds to
the mood and the tragedy that you know is coming. You&#x27;ll find yourself
asking for an extra 5 minutes at least just to delay the final scene
from breaking your heart. Watch it and understand the fragility where
we all stand.
