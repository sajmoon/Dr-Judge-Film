2011_September 27 
I&#x27;ve never written a review on here before, but I felt compelled to
warn everyone else who reads the good reviews on here ... don&#x27;t waste
your time with this garbage.<br /><br />I read a bunch of reviews on here before seeing this film and wondered
why so many people gave ten star reviews while others gave one star
reviews. Well ... now I understand. The people who rated this movie as
ten stars think it&#x27;s funny to tell people to watch a piece of crap
movie to make themselves feel better after wasting two hours of their
own lives.<br /><br />This movie is complete garbage. <br /><br />It opens with a bunch of scenes from space and showing Dunst in her
wedding dress with music playing the whole time. None of this makes any
sense and I sat there watching it wondering what was going on. Even
after I watched the entire movie, I still don&#x27;t know what the opener
was about.<br /><br />When the movie actually starts with some kind of story, you&#x27;re thrown
into a wedding scene with a bunch of characters that you don&#x27;t know
anything about. I just sat there wondering, &#x22;Who are these people ...
and why is Dunst so boring and depressed.&#x22; This drags on and on and on.
I honestly think the first half of the movie had no point at all.
Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />Then the second half starts and you finally get to the part about the
colliding planets. Not really interesting. This half of the movie
deserves one star while the first half deserves less than one star.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to spoil the ending, but I&#x27;ll just say you will be really
disappointed. <br /><br />Do not see this film!
