Melancholia (2011)<br /><br />*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />-A Story of Hope, subtle, as it should be <br /><br />A belated review by Ken Ashe Published: February 5, 2012<br /><br />Steven King&#x27;s, &#x22;The Mist&#x22;, is a tale of horror but ending with a small,
all important, moment of hope. As the main character, his newly
acquired wife, and his son travel out of their macabre nightmare they
listen to the static on the car&#x27;s radio hoping against hope for any
sign of life beyond their own. And for a brief moment, they think they
hear something audible, a voice. This is the single moment of hope
standing out like a light house, driving them forward.<br /><br />I saw &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; last night. It reminded me of that subtle moment of
hope in King&#x27;s short story. This is probably the best movie I have ever
seen. Stanley Kubrick lives, but multiplied by the genius of Lars von
Trier to new levels. <br /><br />It would be hard to write a &#x22;spoiler&#x22; in any review about a film which
begins with a spectacularly orchestrated, musically as well as
visually, end of the movie where the worlds collide. This sets aside
any thought of a super hero swooping in like a comic book movie to save
the day. You are now ready to see the characters and the message
without false expectations for the end. That said, this review has some
spoilers. Even though this movie has been out for some time, if you
have not seen it you may wish to before reading more of this review. <br /><br />The film is a novel on screen, full of types, metaphors, and references
just like any great work of literature. The odd star seen too grow in
the East announces the coming of something new, ultimately revealing it
is a planet on a collision course with Earth. Under this star the wise
men bearing gifts are attending a wedding instead of a birth. Like
Shakespeare, there is no lack of biblical connection in this film. <br /><br />This is a complex story of mankind, of our hopes and fears. It is told
from the view of the atheist, Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a seer of doom
able to know that we are alone, the only life in the cosmos, and soon
to be extinguished. &#x22;We are alone&#x22; she says, and like the soon coming
planet named Melancholia she personifies the depression that logically
follows. <br /><br />She is struggling with all that is supposed to give our lives meaning;
marriage, family, work all wrapped up in one night. All the while her
mother&#x27;s voice in her head proclaims with one hundred percent certainty
the meaninglessness of it all. Her sister begs her not to listen to
that voice but to hold steady. <br /><br />The sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), is the voice of reason, and
meaning. She has the strength to push forward, to bath her severely
depressed sister, to force her to ride their horses even if to nowhere,
and to put one foot in front of the other even when it is a struggle.<br /><br />The strong patriarch, John (Kiefer Sutherland), the provider of safety
for the family, seeing his role doomed, lies down in a manger and gives
up his life. The matriarch, Justine, covers him with hey, and even the
animals are still and silenced by this scene. <br /><br />The child, Leo (Cameron Spurr), devises a simple little twisted wire
contraption which reveals more truth than all the scientists of the
world, doom is coming, and it is assured. This leads to one of the most
beautiful moments in the film. Justine, the utterly depressive hopeless
disconnected atheist, reaches out and embraces the child. She makes a
willful conscious decision to pass on the answer she has so long
rejected. In this beautiful moment of sacrifice, sacrifice of her
intellect, sacrifice of all her knowledge, she gives the child the
comfort of Myth. <br /><br />She tells him that his father, the patriarch, forgot something. He
forgot about the magic cave. And through the ritual of whittling and
fashioning sticks from the earth, they lose their cares and concerns as
they create one last spire pointing to heaven. <br /><br />As Justine, Claire, and Leo crawl into the magic cave, a retreat into
Plato&#x27;s cave, the second and most touching scene of the film occurs. As
doom approaches Justine finally realizes something. They each reach
out, hold hands, and connect. We may be the only life in the cosmos,
but we are not alone, we have each other.<br /><br />It is then, in the chapel built and fashioned by their own hands, they
go to the fear and hope of glory together. <br /><br />&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
