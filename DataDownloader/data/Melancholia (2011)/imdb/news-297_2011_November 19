It upsets me when a film that has such wondrous cinematography and
production value is undermined by a sadistic premise, shoddy
improvisation and utter disregard for the audience. It upsets me
further when it appears no one cares. <br /><br />&#x22;Dancer In The Dark&#x22; is a phenomenal film. The improvisation with
dialog is believable and incisive. The dialog here (as well as the
situations) is melodramatic and just inane. It&#x27;s only saving grace is
the acting and visuals. The pacing is so slow that I had to fast
forward through it (saw it on iTunes).<br /><br />The idea of manifesting depression as an audience experience is an
interesting one, but ultimately unrewarding.
