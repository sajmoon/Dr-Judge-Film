I saw last night in cinema this movie, it is a joke of how stupid it
is, and people not in right mind call it art, and call the director
artist !! After one hour, I felt nausea because of the shitty camera
moving up and down, and the subject makes you more than bored, but
nervous about the stupidity of the idea ...<br /><br />Awful movie, wasted some good hours of my life and a nice Saturday
night ! I don&#x27;t recall at the moment a worse movie I&#x27;ve seen in Cinema,
I made a special account on IMDb to warn you about this.<br /><br />To the ones voting this film, because IMDb is supposed to set some
standards for grading, 7.7 for this ?!?!??!? Are you crazy ?!?!?! Stop
deceiving people !!! Too bad I couldn&#x27;t ask for my money back !!
