2012_January 4 
Being my first experience with a Lars Von Trier film I was hoping that
it&#x27;s quality would live up to the standard I&#x27;ve heard him boasting
about in various interviews throughout the years. However the primary
impression I was left with was just how little I cared for the
characters and how unstirred I was by the themes on display.<br /><br />The opening montage is quite an amazing piece of film making but I
found the good will from it begin to wane as throughout the film
interesting characters and possible conflicts (Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s mother
and father, her job at the ad agency) were either forgotten about or
given fairly unsatisfactory conclusions.<br /><br />I would have been able to look past the vapid drama if some more
compelling themes had arisen through the presence of Melancholia, but
all the film seemed to be interested in was asserting that Earth is an
evil place and it deserves to be destroyed. And although I would
usually be quite invested in such motifs, it seems a bit short sighted
considering the many other possible themes arising from LIFE ON EARTH
BEING DESTROYED BY ANOTHER PLANET.<br /><br />Considering similar subject matter had been tackled so well in two
other films this year (The Tree of Life and Another Earth) I may be
short changing the originality on display, but the dull wedding drama
and weight of runtime devoted to it overshadow the brilliant visuals
and music on display during the Earth&#x27;s destruction. And for me this is
what ultimately holds Melancholia back from being something truly
memorable
