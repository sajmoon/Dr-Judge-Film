Sometimes at the end of a film one cannot do anything but just try to
absorb it. I am one of those people that at the end of a film I always
try to write a review as soon as possible. After watching Melancholia,
I said to myself- &#x22;Why do I need to let others in on this? Why do I
have to write my feelings toward this film for others?&#x22; I have felt
this way after watching a film only a few times, mostly really personal
films. <br /><br />I want to start off talking about the prologue. Amazingly photographed
and edited, with great music. When people compared it to Antichrist I
was skeptical. Yeah sure, I think Antichrist was powerful, but to me
one of its biggest flaws was its prologue besides the 3rd act. I just
thought that while the music was great and there were some great shots,
many of the shots were just so self-indulgent even for Von Trier. A lot
of its prologue seemed too stylized, too pretentious, even for me
(whose favorite films usually consist of terms like that that would be
used by people). However, I thought the prologue for Melancholia was
all around much better. It felt better constructed, more realized, more
meaningful (especially because he didn&#x27;t have too many shots of other
unrelated things), not to mention its last shot was absolutely
incredible. <br /><br />We are then taken to the film&#x27;s first part titled JUSTINE. I thought
that it was a great start. Kirsten Dunst starts off the film like a
seemingly ordinary happy bride. However, as the first part progresses
we see her deep feelings of pointlessness and darkness. I am happy to
say that I have not met many people who are depressed, but even then
one can see the incredible subtle work Dunst did. In fact, this is one
of those performances that hits deeper the more it sinks in. She makes
it quite clear how much of an illness it is. Part Two, titled CLAIRE,
focuses more on Justine&#x27;s older sister. Unlike Justine, Claire seems to
live a more ordinary life. This is where the science-fiction aspect of
the story comes to play. Funny that I wouldn&#x27;t really want to label the
film as sci-fi, or maybe I should label it as such as a new form of
sci-fi. Personally, I have never been depressed, so I could understand
Claire&#x27;s feelings of fear much better than Justine&#x27;s. It doesn&#x27;t mean I
like Claire better, it just means that I could definitely sense a sort
of shared fear and sadness with Claire. Yet because we know how the
film will end, one cannot truly ride this journey along with the
characters. It isn&#x27;t a flaw, not at all, it&#x27;s just Von Trier&#x27;s purpose.
He wants us to be able to know who the characters are and then, while
not truly sharing their same feelings and experiencing this with them,
be able to distinguish by how different their fears and states-of-mind
are. <br /><br />In the film&#x27;s central theme I think it is similar to Antichrist. It may
not be as controversial or disturbing, but it definitely belongs in the
same trilogy. That ending is Von Trier&#x27;s most powerful to date, and the
film is a near-masterpiece behind Dogville and in the same ranks as
Breaking the Waves. I am glad that he decided to tell a story more
patiently, more soothingly and more gentler than Antichrist, and it
turned out to be better. I thought Gainsbourg would never top off her
work in Antichrist, but here it makes me wonder. A stand-out.
