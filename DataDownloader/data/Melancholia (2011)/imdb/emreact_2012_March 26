If you don&#x27;t have a story to tell or an idea worth sharing with your
fellow homo-sapiens&#x27; OR if you think it would be enough for creating a
movie to polish something or anything with some above average acting
and posh cinematography you might want to become Trier doing the
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22;. If you want to get inspired about thinking between
scales of perception and blues of human psyche in a calm, different way
of representation of reality, go see The Tree of Life or Another Earth.
It is not the question whether those latter two are masterpieces or not
but at least their creators honestly try to deal with their issues
(yes, they have issues -unlike Trier- worthy of being transformed into
the form of a movie ) and try to share them.
