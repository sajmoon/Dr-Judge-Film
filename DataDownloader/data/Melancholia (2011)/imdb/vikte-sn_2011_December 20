There were 2 reasons why I watched this movie - firstly, I&#x27;ve read good
reviews about it, secondly, there was one of my favorite actors
starring in it. But I didn&#x27;t enjoyed it at all. First challenge for my
patience was that long slow-motion beginning. In fact, all the movie
was slow. The characters were unlovable. They acted in the ways I
couldn&#x27;t understand. Most of the movie I was wandering &#x27;&#x27;what a f... is
going on???&#x27;&#x27;. I know, they were all depressed and melancholic, facing
the possibility of the end of the world, but even in that context they
sucked badly. For that reason, their suffering didn&#x27;t move me at all,
and, as nothing more was happening in the movie, I found it very
boring. As I wasn&#x27;t engaged in emotional aspects of the movie, I
started to analyze the possibility of such a big unknown planet passing
by and finally colliding with the Earth - and that didn&#x27;t make any
sense. The very collision was also nothing like I would imagine. I&#x27;m
surprised that many people have found something familiar in this movie.
I&#x27;m melancholic and I feel depressed almost all the time, but I
couldn&#x27;t find anything familiar in &#x27;&#x27;Melancholia&#x27;&#x27;. I found this movie
not as depressing as irritating.
