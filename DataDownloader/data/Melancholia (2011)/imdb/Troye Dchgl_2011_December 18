Okay this should be a brief review, mostly because I cannot find much
to say. The thing is that this new &#x22;Armageddon&#x22; is definitely different
and one of its kind.<br /><br />First, the good: The story of a possible collision between Earth and
the planet of Melancholia is presented simply enough, and in a somewhat
artistic way. The collision is not unheard of; it is known by the
characters. Making use of that, the plot covers the reactions focusing
on the lives of a few characters. The acting performed by the cast is
amazingly done, and I quite like the way the ambient music and the
cinematography reinforces the message of the approaching Melancholia
throughout.<br /><br />And the bad: Some scenes are found to be quite long and boring, and
sometimes the lack of conversation is also a problem. With the film
divided into the two chapters, the first part is relatively more rich
in contents or interactions and less sentimental, while the latter part
is quite the exact opposite. In spite of the problem of the boredom I
mentioned, I still find the second chapter much more intriguing while
the first falls flat.<br /><br />The conclusion: Melancholia is one of the one-of-a-kind films out there
and it describes a doomsday scenario relying on a more artistic
approach instead of the totally &#x22;commercial feeling&#x22; of Armageddon.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I enjoyed Armageddon, but I am not going to make
too much comparison, as they are in two completely different categories
though the plot is somewhat similar.
