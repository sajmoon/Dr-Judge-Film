Lars von Trier certainly is a great promoter and what he said about
Hitler in Cannes, will obviously make people curious about this film.<br /><br />It&#x27;s about the nature of depression. Kirsten Dunst goes through a
hellish wedding dinner, while this planet, Melancholia approaches
Earth. As it comes nearer, Dunst accepts it and she also accepts her
own melancholia on the contrary to her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg,
who has no contact with her feelings, until it&#x27;s inevitable.<br /><br />Nobody makes pictures like von Trier. And nobody uses such beautiful
photo. In the end, this is a film for viewing, more than thinking or
feeling about. von Trier has the tools for that too. Impressive.
