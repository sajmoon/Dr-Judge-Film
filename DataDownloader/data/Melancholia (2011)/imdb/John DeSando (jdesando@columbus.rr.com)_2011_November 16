&#x22;Enjoy it while it lasts.&#x22; Justine&#x27;s mother, Gaby (Charlotte Rampling),
on the day of Justine&#x27;s wedding.<br /><br />Lars von Trier&#x27;s Melancholia, a dramatic science fiction film in which
the titular planet moves toward and away from earth, is like the second
half of Mike Cahill&#x27;s recent Another Earth, in which a planet also
appears in the sky as close as the moon. Metaphors abound, of course,
as our other selves and our darkest fears become manifest in the
foreign intrusions.<br /><br />Besides the obvious melancholic nature of living embodied in the
encroaching body, Melancholia tells of two worlds in two sections: the
human comedy in Justine&#x27;s (Kirstin Dunst) wedding party in the first
part, and her sister Claire&#x27;s (Charlotte Gainsbourg) growing fear in
the second part about the visiting planet while Justine grows more
mature and sure of herself. In effect both represent the human
awareness of a Bergman-like deathly presence as in the Seventh Seal.
(In fact, the banquet and the ensuing muted chaos remind me of his Wild
Strawberries.) No scene in the film can match the exotic forest scene
where Justine, nude and perfect in form, bathes in the light of the new
planet, offering herself it would seem to a force both romantic and
unknown. Perhaps the scene crystallizes the film&#x27;s duality: sensual
life versus impending death. While von Trier has an affinity for the
abstract and symbolic (among others see Dogville and Dancer in the
Dark), in Melancholia he is what he is: representing flawed humanity in
a spare allegory with little hope those disasters, be they family or
cosmic, are unavoidable in the larger context of an indifferent
universe and a mentally-challenged humanity.<br /><br />On that last point, von Trier is no stranger to aberrations (witness
his recent comments about Hitler) and it would seem to mental
instability (most of the characters in Melancholia are in stages of
melancholy if not downright suicidal mentality). For most of the
audience, writer/director von Trier may be too abstract, formalistic,
and downright fuzzy.<br /><br />For me, he has attacked our inclination to optimism and hope and traded
them for a magic realism that moves like the new planet into
resignation to the human condition and acceptance of death that can
bring serenity if you look at it not through the telescope of narrow
vision but straight on as it inevitably consumes the earth.
