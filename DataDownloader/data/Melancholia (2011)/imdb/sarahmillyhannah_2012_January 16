Wow. That&#x27;s really all i can say about this movie. Obviously IMDb
require more for a title review. But I watched this movie late last
night. I had tears in my eyes at the final scene and this morning it
was one of the first things that came into my mind. Everything about it
was beautiful. I watched this with my husband. I say watch, he didn&#x27;t
watch it at all really, rattled around on his iPad then expected me to
explain the whole film to him and then proceeding to give it a 3 out of
10. Yeah, typical male, no blood, guts, gore or Bruce Willis dangling
from a light fitting with a ripped, bloodied shirt hanging off his
back. Apologies to the males who do like a film with a bit more to it
than that but my husband doesn&#x27;t seem to be too fussed with a film
thats more dramatic and thought provoking. Which indeed this is. At
first I wasn&#x27;t too struck with the opening, felt long and drawn out and
the music went on, but later on in the film when it was more explained
what this was about it made sense. Huge sense. In fact it was at this
point in the movie I felt that everything that had gone on previously
all boiled down to how the characters were going to deal with this
moment. I don&#x27;t want to give anything away but all i will say is my
whole heart was with Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s character, which just goes
to show how well she played her part, her strength but vulnerability
also at this moment in the movie. It just goes to show that sometimes a
magic cave is just not enough..
