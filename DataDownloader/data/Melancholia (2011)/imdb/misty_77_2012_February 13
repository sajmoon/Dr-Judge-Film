There&#x27;s a serious polarity in the reviews for this film,and I&#x27;m not
surprised. If you&#x27;ve ever suffered depression this bleak movie will hit
hard, and you&#x27;ll pick up on all of the subtle messages it sends out.
It&#x27;s done so well it can&#x27;t be anything other than achingly familiar.
The despondency, and the frustration the sufferer feels at their own
despondency, in particular, is well conveyed. <br /><br />Unfortunately I think a large chunk of the people who&#x27;ve seen this film
(and there aren&#x27;t many who have, sadly) went to it expecting a slightly
arty apocalypse movie. It&#x27;s not a smarter Deep Impact. The (blue)
planet Melancholia is just a metaphor for depression. Unrelenting and
irresistible, Melancholia has the main character in its thrall.<br /><br />For those who don&#x27;t &#x22;get&#x22; this movie, no it&#x27;s not a pretentious, pseudo
intellectual flick. Rather it&#x27;s a well crafted take on the fine detail
of a subject matter that you have been fortunate enough to not have had
to understand. Long may that be the case.
