Thanks to &#x22;24,&#x22; we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to watching Kiefer Sutherland
save the world/country pretty much annually. So when he ceases his
self-assured running around and swallows a bottle of pills in the
horses&#x27; stables instead, you know something is wrong.<br /><br />In this case, it&#x27;s the eponymous planet in the latest Lars Von Trier
film, &#x22;Melancholia,&#x22; that is about to collide with Earth and kill all
living things. He decided to get out a few hours early.<br /><br />While director Lars Von Trier may have surprised his character with
this collision, he does not surprise us. The opening of the film is
several minutes of footage of the event itself&#x97;or, more accurately, the
moments just before. It is highly stylized and extraordinarily
gorgeous. And it lets you know right off the bat: everyone dies.<br /><br />But the first casualty is a wedding.<br /><br />Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a young woman with a history of depression, is
the beautiful bride getting married to her earnest, lanky groom,
Michael (Alexander Skarsgaard). He loves her very much and has just
bought them some property&#x97;an orchard. Justine&#x27;s sister Claire
(Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her wealthy husband John (Sutherland) are
hosting the ceremony and reception at their lakeside mansion. In
attendance are Justine&#x27;s smarmy boss, the girls&#x27; father and his two
mistresses named Betty, the girls&#x27; mother (Charlotte Rampling) and her
spectacular omni-hatred, the butlers, the henchmen, and the rest of the
friends and family. As Justine self-destructs, teetering on the edge of
another bout of depression, the wedding unfolds disaster by disaster.
Sometimes it&#x27;s comical, sometimes it&#x27;s devastating.<br /><br />The audience&#x27;s feelings toward the groom become parallel to our
feelings toward everyone else: sympathy for impending doom. We know
about it, and they don&#x27;t. We see the bride&#x27;s disengagement, her
efforts&#x97;and ultimate failure&#x97;to act how she knows she&#x27;s supposed to
act, and we know that the groom is in for some heartbreak just as we
know that everyone in the film is in for some fiery death. Ms. Dunst
pulls off an amazing performance (never thought I&#x27;d write
that)&#x97;expressing a very yucky thing lying just beneath the surface of a
very pretty thing.<br /><br />After the wedding, Justine plummets into a deep depression and goes to
live with her sister. It is here that we get to see the vast
differences between the two girls. Claire is your typical, practical,
responsible woman. She helps her sister bathe, cooks her favorite meals
for her, and tucks her into bed, all while managing her own son, Leo.
She is somewhat worried about what they&#x27;re saying on TV about
Melancholia&#x27;s slight chance of collision with Earth. Justine, on the
other hand, can barely feed herself, has lost her job, and has checked
out of life completely. She has no worries about Melancholia or the
destruction of Earth, which seems to know as imminent. &#x22;Life on Earth
is horrible,&#x22; she says. &#x22;No one will miss it.&#x22; Toward the end, though,
as disaster approaches, it is Claire who is made to look helpless.
Justine&#x27;s resigned calm is a far more practical response in this
context, and she is the one who leads the remaining three (after John&#x27;s
suicide) through their last few minutes.<br /><br />This movie is great for getting you to think about death. We don&#x27;t
really think about it often, especially in our youth. The approaching
planet, they say, has been &#x22;hidden behind the sun&#x22; until just recently,
and now it is looming as large as the moon in our sky. This, if you
think about it, is essentially the same path death, as a concept, takes
on the consciousness in the course of a human life: invisible at first,
then more and more visible as time passes. Von Trier uses the
characters in his film to illustrate the different ways people deal
with it. Some, like John, can&#x27;t handle it and cut out early. Some, like
Claire, struggle absurdly to avoid it or delay it, and some, like
Justine, accept it as they would a parking citation and then go lie
naked on the edge of a riverbank. Some, like the horses, neigh.<br /><br />What if we could see death in this way, Von Trier asks, as a physical
presence on the horizon? Would we act the same, if we just had to turn
our heads to see our own personal apocalypse up there in the sky,
getting bigger and bigger? His elbow to the ribs with this film is that
the only real differences between the horror that transpires in the
movie and what happens in all of our lives are the mode and the scale.<br /><br />I think the message, then, is that the most appropriate reaction to
Melancholia, the planet, is Melancholia, the condition. While Von Trier
may have gone cosmic with this film, no one could ever call him
&#x22;sunny.&#x22;
