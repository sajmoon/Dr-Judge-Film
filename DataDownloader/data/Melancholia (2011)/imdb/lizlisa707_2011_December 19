i find myself speechless at the film but more so to many unjustified,
unsupported comments out there <br /><br />i who consider myself mostly the &#x22;normal&#x22; kind of person am starting to
understand more and more why there are people who are so depressed
about this world and existence <br /><br />i feel regret and sorry for those who was bored during the movie, for
those never gifted with true sadness and capacity to relate but also at
the same time jealous at these people and however bored they are,
should take away the fact that this is the evidence that they are
incredibly lucky to be just so &#x22;normal&#x22;
