Really? 7.4 out of 10 and 80 on the meta score? Nothing happens for 2
hours and when something looks kind of exciting it&#x27;s over in 1 minute.
The only good thing about this film is Kiefer Sutherland (The reason
why I watched this crap) and John Hurt. If you think you&#x27;re going to
get a strong and powerful film,think again.And the title bit feels like
it lasts forever. They could&#x27;ve cut out about 40 minutes of this film
so I wouldn&#x27;t need to try and sit still for that long. Please don&#x27;t
watch this! You will be doing yourself a massive favor. So to sum up
it&#x27;s utter crap nothing happens and I can&#x27;t stress this enough. PLEASE
PLEASE DON&#x27;T WATCH THIS!
