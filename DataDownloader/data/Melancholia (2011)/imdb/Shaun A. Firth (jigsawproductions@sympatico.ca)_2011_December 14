OK, I have to start by being honest. I am NOT a Lars Von Trier fan. My
first experience with him was in 1996 when I saw &#x22;Breaking the Waves&#x22;
at the Toronto International Film Festival. When it was over I found
I&#x27;d been both bored and depressed. I was very impressed by Emily Watson
and Stellan Skarsgard, but beyond that, I&#x27;ve never understood why
critics were so impressed by it. I feel pretty much the same way about
Melancholia. First, it&#x27;s the perfect name for this film. And the blue
planet is just the right colour. The film left me feeling blue. Which
would have been fine, if it hadn&#x27;t also left me feeling like that was
two hours of my life I&#x27;m never going to get back. And I even fast-
forwarded over a few parts. The film is absolutely oppressive. From the
despair of the main character, who is borderline suicidal on what
should be the happiest day of her life, to the anger expressed by her
brother-in-law, played by Kiefer Sutherland, because he paid so much
money for a wedding that is starting to feel more like a funeral.
That&#x27;s not to say the film is without any merit. Once again the acting
is first rate. While I don&#x27;t like Von Trier as a writer or a creator,
he does have a talent for getting the best from his actors. Kirsten
Dunst is so depressing she made me want to slit my wrists. The rest of
the cast of primarily A-List European actors also turn in fine
performances. However, while I thought they did a great job with the
material, part of my problem is also the attitude that most of them
take with regard to the possibility of impending doom. There are
momentous events taking place in the world around them, but the
characters seem totally uninterested, even disconnected.<br /><br />So I guess I came away from this Von Triers nightmare feeling pretty
much the same as I did after seeing Dancer in the Dark and Dogville.
Not Idiots though, I just plain hated that experimental disaster. Once
again Von Trier has treated us to a film that is visually striking, and
very well acted. But the stories that these actors present are for the
most part confusing and tiresome. There is certainly a lot of
originality in his work. Of that there is no arguing. But for me, once
you get past the performances, the icing if you will, there&#x27;s no cake.
So the whole experience leaves you empty, and dying for a cup of coffee
to wake you up! If you want to see a movie about the sudden appearance
of a companion planet, I would instead suggest &#x22;Another Earth&#x22; by Mike
Cahill and starring the terrific William Mapother and the fresh new
Brit Marling. This movie has a few of the same problems, like the lack
of surprise that seems to accompany the news of an identical Earth
suddenly appearing in our sky. But the plot is so much more compelling
that the flaws are much easier to forgive.
