&#x27;MELANCHOLIA&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />A dramatic science fiction disaster film with the end of the world seen
through the eyes of two sisters. This is a disaster film like no other,
from the mind of writer / director Lars von Trier (who also helmed such
other past critical darlings as &#x27;DANCER IN THE DARK&#x27; and &#x27;DOGVILLE&#x27;).
In this film life is threatened by a mysterious planet known as
&#x27;Melancholia&#x27;, which is on a collision course with Earth. The title of
the film has a double meaning as it also describes the state of Kirsten
Dunst&#x27;s lead character, who is in extreme depression for the majority
of the film. The movie is definitely not without it&#x27;s flaws but it&#x27;s
still a very unique and memorable film going experience.<br /><br />The film begins with a series of visions of the end of the world as the
planet Melancholia strikes Earth (all played out in slow motion to
opera music by Richard Wagner). It is unclear who&#x27;s visions they are or
what they all mean. We then meet Justine (Dunst) and her fianc&#xE9; Michael
(Alexander Skarsgard) on their wedding night as well as Justine&#x27;s
sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer
Sutherland), who are hosting the wedding reception. We also meet much
of Justine&#x27;s family and friends as we experience a very odd and
emotional wedding and learn that Justine suffers from severe depression
(which sort of puts a damper on her wedding). We later learn that the
planet Melancholia is in fact on a course towards Earth, in which many
believe it will collide as others believe it will fly by. We stay with
the core characters as they struggle with what could be all of
mankind&#x27;s impending doom.<br /><br />The movie kind of plays out in two distinct halves, the first centering
on the wedding and the second on Justine&#x27;s further depression and her
sister&#x27;s fear of the end of the world. We learn more about the two main
characters as the film goes on but the film stays solely with them, as
well as John and he and Claire&#x27;s son Leo (Cameron Spurr), at their
isolated mansion away from the city. Unlike other disaster films the
end of the world in this movie only revolves around these four
characters. The main point of the movie is to explore depression and
how it effects people as well as show how well depressed people
function in highly stressed situations, due to the fact that their not
afraid of disaster striking as they usually already expect it. In that
way the film is effective and fascinating. I also really liked the
unique new take on the &#x27;end of the world&#x27; film. Dunst and all of the
actors in the film are spectacular and it&#x27;s a grade A production all
around. It&#x27;s very slow moving at times though and it isn&#x27;t quite as
grand a movie as it thinks it is. Many are annoyed that it was snubbed
by the Oscars but it doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that this and other
dark and edgy films like &#x27;DRIVE&#x27; almost never get the Academy&#x27;s
attention (that&#x27;s to be expected). It is better than a lot of what was
nominated, that&#x27;s for sure.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
