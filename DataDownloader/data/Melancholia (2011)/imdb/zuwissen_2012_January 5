It&#x27;s an Armageddon like we&#x27;ve never seen, and the looming planet of
Melancholia is the most beautiful way the world could end. There is no
anarchy. No one runs down the street attempting to escape a flood,
blizzard, or the Empire State Building that is about to come down on
their head. Instead it is an account of a family facing the end of the
world; some are left only with dread, others have faith they will
survive unscathed. Dunst does a great job, although there are a few
exposing scenes that I could&#x27;ve done without. (Alright already, we
understand she&#x27;s paralyzed by depression, but we don&#x27;t need to see her
sister bathe her.) Bottom line: The premise amazing, and although the
movie is painted beautifully, Von Trier does a poor job telling what
could have been an amazing story.
