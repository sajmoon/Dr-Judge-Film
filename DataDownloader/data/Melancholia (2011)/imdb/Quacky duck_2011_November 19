Well, the movie is exactly as It&#x27;s title suggests.<br /><br />I have suffered from depression for so long that I can not even
remember when it first began.<br /><br />So it was easy for me to identify with the film. <br /><br />Lars has definitely created a visually stunning film.<br /><br />I also felt that Kirsten&#x27;s performance demonstrated depth of talent. <br /><br />Keifer offered a poor performance as per usual. <br /><br />I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone pays him to act.<br /><br />A well put together film, most of the performances were extraordinary,
Lars put in a solid effort and of course I love to watch Alex.<br /><br />The film is a perfect dramatization of a persons internal suffering and
the effect that is has on those around them. <br /><br />People with depression become alienated, no one wants to deal with them
and their pain is so intolerable that they can not bear it alone, yet
they lack the capability to function adequately in any kind of long
term relationship. <br /><br />Possibly worth watching depending on what you are looking for.
