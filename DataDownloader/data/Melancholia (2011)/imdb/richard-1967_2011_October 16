This is not an easy movie to watch. It&#x27;s tough from the very beginning
- a prologue prequel with music by Wagner and an apocalyptic
perspective. Any movie in which dead birds fall from the sky in the
first three minutes is not going to be light and fluffy.<br /><br />But this movie, about deep melancholia experienced by Justine (Kirstin
Dunst), the principal character, and the melancholia of the potential
end of life itself, is an artistic triumph. Great acting, great
cinematography, great music. Even the sometimes puzzling plot - the
post-prologue movie comes in two halves - is engrossing and pregnant
with underlying meaning. The three principal characters all represent a
point on the compass of human feelings: Depression, anxiety, and
something resembling nice normalcy. How each deals with the apocalypse
is a well-threaded effort.<br /><br />While the movie is dark, it is by no means humorless. The wedding that
occupies the first half of the movie has a great deal of fun alongside
the depression.<br /><br />Not a movie for everyone, and a bit too long, but if you watch it,
stick with it. You may not want to see it twice but you could be glad
you saw it once.
