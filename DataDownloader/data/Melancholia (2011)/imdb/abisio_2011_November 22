I am a fan of Von Trier however this is his worse movie up today. As
always, the movie is divided in acts; this time based on the names of
the two sisters, Justine and Claire who basically from the tale. The
first act is Justine&#x27;s wedding which Trier tries to distanciate from
Vinterberg&#x27;s Celebration, ending in something that does not make any
sense and it is not even funny or emotive. The second act Claire,
starts after the wedding with her taking care of a very depressed
Justine. Everything is about depression; but it is not difficult to
feel that way when world about to collide with another planet ( which
happens in the first scene of the movie ) so I have no idea where was
he intended to go with that premise.<br /><br />In fact, I believe Trier run out of ideas, so he basically barely edit
the movie (there are scenes and characters that does not make any
sense(like Udo Kier character) or framing and continuity errors.
Probably 30 minutes less (the movie is over two hours) could help at
least to make it more bearable.<br /><br />Trier is obviously well recognized and admired; the movie has Kristen
Dunst and Charlotte Gainsburg in an interpretative duel worth seeing by
itself; but also a list of very good actors doing little more than
cameos.<br /><br />Really a pity
