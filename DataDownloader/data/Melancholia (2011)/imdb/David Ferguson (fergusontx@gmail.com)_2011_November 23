Greetings again from the darkness. Anyone who walks into this film
having not seen the trailer or being unfamiliar with the previous works
of writer/director Lars von Trier has my sincere sympathy. He is a
unique and ambitious filmmaker with a touch of expressionism and a
unique visual style. His movies are seen by a small audience and
appreciated by even fewer. And on top of that, he may be the least
politically correct celeb working today.<br /><br />The film begins with a most unusual prologue backed by Wagner&#x27;s ominous
composition and numerous visuals that play like slow moving paintings.
Clearly, the end of the world is at hand. After that, we get two parts:
Part 1 Justine, and Part 2 Claire. Justine (Kristen Dunst) is first
seen in her wedding gown heading towards the reception with her new
husband (Alexander Skarsgard). Normally, this is one of the happiest
times of anyone&#x27;s life, but here something is just not quite right.
Once inside, we begin to understand. Justine&#x27;s family and friends are
all a bit off-center, and she is the worst of all.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t go into the details because what really matters is that
Melancholia, a large blue planet, is headed directly towards earth.
Kiefer Sutherland plays Justine&#x27;s brother-in-law and he assures
everyone that the pass by will be a special moment and no need to fear
a collision. His wife Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) believes her
husband and tries to comfort her sister Justine.<br /><br />The supporting cast is outstanding and includes Alexander Skarsgard as
the groom, Stellan Skarsgard as Justine&#x27;s over-bearing employer,
Charlotte Rampling as Justine&#x27;s mother, John Hurt as the father, Jesper
Christensen as the caretaker and creepy Udo Kier as the wedding
planner. It&#x27;s quite a cast and the only real point of their existence
seems to be having Justine and the viewer question if this existence is
better than no existence ... which could happen in 5 days.<br /><br />This year has provided quite a metaphysical buffet at the theater. We
have had &#x22;The Tree of Life&#x22;, &#x22;Another Earth&#x22;, &#x22;Take Shelter&#x22; and now
this entry from von Trier. This group will have you questioning many
things in life, and beyond. The other similarity between the three is
the artistic craftsmanship with which each is made. Clearly two famous
paintings play a key role for von Trier, and is final shot is done with
such a deft touch that only guys like Tony Scott and Michael Bay will
feel let down.<br /><br />I certainly can&#x27;t recommend this one to all. It is somewhat slow moving
and filled with symbolism and characters bordering on depression. It is
beautiful to look at, but tough to watch. My guess is you already know
if this is one for you.
