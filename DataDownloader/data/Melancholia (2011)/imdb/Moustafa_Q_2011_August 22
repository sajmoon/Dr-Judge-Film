A beautiful film about art, life, sacrifice. Very European, refined,
splendid image, subtle acting, atmosphere of a historical period
recreated in magnificent way. But the principal error is the beauty of
a movie in which food, costumes, colors, words, art in every form
transforms the story in ordinary pretext.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst is a brilliant Justine and her impressive talent, her
artistic force are reflected in acting. But Justine was not a victim of
hypocrite nobles, of time and of his social origins. The last gesture
was not only result of duty conscience. And Von Trier was not a great
artist in a fragile domain.<br /><br />Her ennui was her life. The parties, the food, the organization of a
entire show was essence of an touching existence and reflection of the
time&#x27;s glory. This sophisticated art to be crux of a world was secret
ingredient of a special moral victory. So, Justine was more than a
small character, builder of little extravagant shows, toy of
aristocracy. Her life, her death was ineffable form of sacrifice for a
special gift: art to be yourself, part and builder of dream, heart of
miracle and desire.
