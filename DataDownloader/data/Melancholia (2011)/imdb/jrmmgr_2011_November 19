If you love parsing out metaphors in films, you&#x27;ll love this one.
Current cultural phenomena are reduced to the interactions of just a
few people on an isolated estate, and the metaphors are interwoven,
interconnected, apt and rich, which is why I enjoyed &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;.<br /><br />I also loved the 1951 film &#x22;When Worlds Collide&#x22;. Compare that to
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; and you&#x27;ll wonder at how the world has changed.<br /><br />Compare it also to &#x22;The Road&#x22; which attempted a realistic vision of
humanity faced with the end times but left room for hope. <br /><br />Von Trier has no hope, but the audience craves it, which is why
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; will not be a popular success.
