Where to begin.. As anyone that&#x27;s reading the comments probably knows,
this is a movie about a planet, Melancholia, about twice the diameter
of Earth, that has been hiding behind the sun (?) and is now on a
collision course with Earth. How that is possible is beyond me, as the
movie is set in present time I wonder how the Hubble space telescope
managed to miss that. OK, all this could easily be forgiven if the
movie was good. Sadly it isn&#x27;t.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that it&#x27;s just so unbelievably
boring. After a long and slow series of extreme slow motion shots of
Kirsten Dunst looking half dead with birds falling out of the sky and a
horse dropping to it&#x27;s knees, along with a shot of the planets actually
colliding, we get to a scene where Dunst and her fianc&#xE9; (Alexander
Skarsg&#xE5;rd) arrive at their wedding. From there we get to witness the
wedding for a full hour (!).<br /><br />After an hour of watching a wedding of people we care or know nothing
about, we get to part II. Now I can&#x27;t recall exactly how part II begins
(as I was probably half asleep), but we quickly (in relative terms) get
to the next day, where Dunst is beginning to act sick and weird. We
never learn why exactly but it appears she has some phsychic abilities.
It isn&#x27;t until about 90 minutes or so into the movie that Melancholia
starts playing some role. I won&#x27;t spoil anything from here on although
there really isn&#x27;t anything to spoil anyways.<br /><br />The only compliment I can give this film is that the cinematography is
at times very beautiful, but this doesn&#x27;t matter much when everything
else is bad.<br /><br />I can only recommend this movie to people that like watching paint dry,
rest should stay clear! 1/10.
