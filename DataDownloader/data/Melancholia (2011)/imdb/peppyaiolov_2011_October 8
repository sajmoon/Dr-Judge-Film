I actually didn&#x27;t watch Melancholia, because for a films like this i
use one special player with 10sec.jump option.So I was jumping across
Melancholia.One can&#x27;t really speak about this movie.I understand people
who liked it, probably they experienced the mood of the film,the actual
melancholia.But that&#x27;s all in the movie, only a mood.No story ,no real
feelings ,no thoughts, no real conversations. LvT said that :&#x22;In
Melancholia it&#x27;s interesting to see how the characters we follow react
as the planet approaches Earth.&#x22; If I can comment this, first I will
say there is no WE in &#x22;we follow&#x22; ,Lars von Trier is not with us he is
not WE,he is from another planet,may be Melancholia.Secondly, who cares
how the characters will react at the end of the world, this really
egocentric.If the end of the world is coming which twisted mind is
thinking only about himself closed in a medieval castle.Who cares about
the characters if it is the end of the world.It is the end of
everything.THIS IS THE END!The end should be the main event,the
character not the two non interesting sisters.<br /><br />At the end I can say that now I really like Antihrist, because the
movie has great theme -The revenge of the women, but here I can&#x27;t find
theme ,only a mood-melancholia.<br /><br />This time there is not afterwords for Tarkovski,but the film is using
the basic idea of &#x22;The Sacrifice&#x22;(Offret)1986.Melancholia is not in a
same league with Offret.Tarkovski is an author with clear ideas and
goals in his art.Lars von Tries is just mad ,he is not genius...Still I
will expect his next movie!
