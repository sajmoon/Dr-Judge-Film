i regret the time and money i spent on this movie. me and my wife hated
it so much. i don&#x27;t believe that i could hate a movie so much but yes i
hated this one.<br /><br />we didn&#x27;t get most of the story other than wasting time. many things
didn&#x27;t make sense. no connection between some scenes. i feel mad for
the time i wasted. i want to say to everyone, if you didn&#x27;t like the
first 15 min. don&#x27;t watch the whole movie. i hate to spend time writing
review but IMDb force to write 19 lines and i don&#x27;t have much things to
say other than i didn&#x27;t like this movie. this is the last line and you
should accept my review to be considered as not biased. thank you for
reading.
