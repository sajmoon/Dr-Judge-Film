I&#x27;ve read several reviews complaining that this film was complicated or
didn&#x27;t make sense. It was neither complicated &#x26; made perfect sense.
Question :- If you knew for certain that in a few weeks &#x26; months that
the world would come to a violent &#x26; terrible end &#x26; there was nothing
you could do about it, how would it affect you? Several reviewers on
here are obviously much more appreciative of the &#x27;TRANSFORMERS&#x27; eye
candy type of sci-fi movie where plot comes way down the list &#x26; CGI is
paramount. Trust me, if you liked &#x27;Donnie Darko&#x27;, &#x27;The Nines&#x27; &#x26; &#x27;Moon&#x27;
&#x26; have a brain watch this movie. If you liked &#x27;Armagoddon&#x27;,
&#x27;Transformers&#x27; &#x26; &#x27;G.I. Joe&#x27; &#x26; have half a brain, then best stay home.
