That&#x27;s probably the best thing I can say about Trier&#x27;s latest. And that
the acting was good.<br /><br />I am a big fan of his previous work. I have come to expect some sort of
meaning, some social commentary, something more than superb
cinematographic scenes. I suppose, as with chronic anxiety and
depression, the film &#x22;doesn&#x27;t make sense&#x22; and I guess that&#x27;s fair
enough. It&#x27;s not clear why we are being shown what we are watching.
What is the purpose, if any? Towards the end, there is an inkling that
perhaps, due to the circumstances, a deeply depressed, therefore
utterly self-centered and self-involved Dunst makes a real human
connection, but it is too vague to really enjoy this fleeting moment in
the film.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate was that there weren&#x27;t scenes of hordes of
panicked people trampling each other on the streets (or in the village,
in this case,) which, I learned from the book I was reading at the time
(Nerve by Taylor Clark,) is really not how masses respond to impending
disaster.<br /><br />All in all, another disturbing and depressing film from Trier, but the
golden heart trilogy and The Kingdom remain my favorites of his works.
