Sitting through this boring amateur-art film in an exercise in
futility.<br /><br />It starts with a wedding that has no meaning other than to show you
everyone in there is on drugs or just plain mental. The pride has
unexplained mood changes and actions. The groom has no role. The boss,
the parents, the guests.. all seems to be unaware of the story or the
reason they&#x27;re there!<br /><br />Then the story goes to childish view of how would people react if they
knew doomsday is on the horizon(pun intended).<br /><br />You come out of the film thinking it wasn&#x27;t rocket science they were
explaining in the movie that no one understood. And it wasn&#x27;t a complex
piece of art that that might need a second or a third look to
appreciate it more. None of that, it was the imagination of a dull and
boring storyteller(i.e director).<br /><br />Art critics have agendas, this much have been proved.
