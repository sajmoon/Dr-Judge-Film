A poem. Without words or rules.Sea of fears and obsessions. Amazing
travel. A chain of feelings. Slices of mystic atmosphere and
naturalism.Rich in subtle nuances, strong and delicate picture about
the end of world. A form of Tarkovski and a strange fly. Twoo sisters,
a wedding and a planet. Wagner and delicate nuances. Few drops of
Ingmar Bergman and waves of silence. A film like a punch in stomach.
That is all. The cast, the acting, the scenes are crumbs of a strange
dinner in which definitions, expectations and conclusions are nothing.
It is, in same time,a beautiful movie and a subtle memento mori,
exploration of deep crisis and new Gattoparde of Visconti, a
masterpiece and a confuse sentiment. In fact, only another von Trier.
Same mark but new high. An occasion for Dunst to be amazing primadonna.
A masterpiece, indeed. And for director to give answer to his searches
in skin of impressive question. Melancholia is an special experience.
The rest is silence.
