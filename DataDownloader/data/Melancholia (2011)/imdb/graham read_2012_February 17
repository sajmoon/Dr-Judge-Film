Some lovely music and cinematography for about 6 minutes.<br /><br />Beyond that we have unbelievable characters for whom I felt zero
empathy, being appallingly acted. <br /><br />The scenes were nonsense piled upon itself (e.g. let&#x27;s put some straw
on a dead body of a man who&#x27;s been inexplicably killed by a horse).<br /><br />The scientist in you will real at the ridculous portrayals of telescope
usage, coat hanger misusage and &#x27;you&#x27;re not online again&#x27; commentary.<br /><br />Nice sex scene in a sandpit.<br /><br />Turgid, art-house bullsh*t nonsense - and not in a good way.<br /><br />10 line rule sucks.
