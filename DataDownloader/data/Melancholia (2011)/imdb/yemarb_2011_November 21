This movie was completely horrible. It was predictable and depressing.
Dunst ran around the whole movie acting rude and obnoxious to everyone
she met,frowning all the time and acting like a crazy person, or like
my ex-wife for example. It seems the whole premise of the movie is that
a big planet is going to crash into the Earth, which you can kind of
figure out from the trailer for the movie, and the first minute of the
movie. Seems to me if I thought the world was going to end, I wouldn&#x27;t
go around being obnoxious and rude to everyone I met. Maybe that is how
Dunst is in real life. I even saw the movie for free, and I still feel
like I got robbed.
