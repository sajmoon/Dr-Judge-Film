The movie is painfully slow to watch. It is visually annoying in that
it seems a 10 year old is holding the camera. Constant wiggling, fast
panning and zooming. Even when two people are just sitting, talking,
the camera is bobbing up and down. I have no idea what the filmmaker
was trying to do with this technique - other than to annoy. The dialog
at times is barely audible. I had to keep the volume turned up to
maximum, but still hold a remote in my hand for when a sudden scene
change occurs and the volume shoots through the roof. This movie is one
big pain to sit through. I can&#x27;t help but wonder why such big name
actors signed on.
