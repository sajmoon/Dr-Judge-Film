It is so bad that i was forced to write my first ever review on IMDb. A
complete waste of time, this movie was such a big letdown by Lars Von
Trier, especially after the magnificent Antichrist.<br /><br />I kept waiting for something good to happen, but could only find myself
disappointed after some time. The story only revolves around a planet
approaching earth, and a family&#x27;s reaction towards this fact.
Everything is woven around it. Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s character is pathetic.
Only good actor was Kiefer Sutherland(that too because i like his
voice), but that too in a skewed character.<br /><br />Please don&#x27;t waste your time by watching this.
