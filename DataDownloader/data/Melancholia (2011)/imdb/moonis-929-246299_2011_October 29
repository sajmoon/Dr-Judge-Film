Life is only on earth &#x26; not for long. That quote by Kristen Dunst - the
lead actress of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; hit me hard. It is a powerful film with
an easy &#x26; slow pace. I have never seen a movie with so painful
beautiful emotions. It is a milestone visionary film with breathtaking
photography.<br /><br />Story is simple. In first part, we see Justine getting married and she
is very happy. However, her family does not support her much. They live
in their own world of materialism &#x26; caring only about expenses. Her
divorced mother hates her, as she does not believe marital bliss
anymore. During her wedding, Justine notices a bright star in the sky.
In second part, we found that bright star is actually an another
celestial body called Melancholia which is going to hit earth.
Consequently, we see how people find the importance of life when one
actually loosing it. Instead of focusing on end of the world, the
complicated human emotions have shown with dash of realism.<br /><br />Kristen Dunst has given performance of her lifetime. She will
definitely win an Oscar for that. The direction Lars Von Trier is
simply masterpiece. He is one of the best European filmmakers. Overall,
one of the best films of the year so far.
