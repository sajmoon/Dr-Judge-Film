I went to see &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; without reading anything about it and got
flushed into this weird yet realistic scenario. I want to applaud the
creators for this beautiful, honest and epic piece. The pictures,
settings and actors are just amazing.<br /><br />With &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; you will find a story that didn&#x27;t fit into a special
effects filled Roland Emmerich movie anymore. I would not describe the
movie as boring at all, because on an intellectual level it is filled
with subtle details about people and their relationships to each other,
which we all can relate to. These moments need their time, because
that&#x27;s exactly mirroring reality. All in all a great social study that
makes you think about our happiness.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Just like the movie &#x22;I am Love&#x22; with Tilda Swinton, &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is
able to show, how privileges in life are not worth a penny, if all that
is around, is self-interest, gaucherie and lack of understanding.
Kirsten Dunst understandably got awarded with a golden Palm in Cannes.
She was brave enough to trust the director and certainly convinced in
her difficult role. Just as all other actors did.<br /><br />Embedded into a science fiction event the movie has a strong visual and
emotional impact and should not be missed out by real movie lovers.
