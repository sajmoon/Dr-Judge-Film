This movie is very depressing. Actings are great and the scenery is
beautiful. I found this movie to be painful and annoying to watch, but
I couldn&#x27;t stop watching since I wanted to find out what will happen
next. I am still confused about Chapter 1: Justine&#x27;s behaviour was very
odd and was never explained. I preferred Chapter 2 over Chapter 1.
However I was very disappointed by the ending since many of my
questions were left unanswered. On the more positive note, I think this
movie does a great job depicting pain, fear, powerlessness, acceptance
of death, confusion,and not knowing what will happen. This movie is the
exact definition of its name: melancholy: deep, and long lasting
sadness.
