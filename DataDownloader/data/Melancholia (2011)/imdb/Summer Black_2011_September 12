I&#x27;ve never seen anything so painfully familiar. Every move of Justine,
her every word echoes with the heartache of a melancholiac. And the
inability of the others to understand this pain, their inability to
feel it and understand - it only makes it more familiar to the ones
drowning in this mute slow-motion everyday despair. After watching this
movie I went home without saying a word, I sat down on my chair and sat
there silently for about an hour. I like Lars von Trier, I liked his
movies before, but this one was a headshot. In this one film Lars von
Trier succeeded to show all the ultimate emptiness of the everyday
rituals, the endless longing of a melancholiac and the unbearable
helplessness of this condition - like a bulletproof glass cocoon around
you, muting the sounds and making the colors dim. I vote &#x22;excellent&#x22;,
&#x27;cause this film is closer to my heart than any other I&#x27;ve seen before.
