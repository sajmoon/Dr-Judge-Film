Yes, it was visually impressive but of the 7+ billion people on the
planet, why did Lars von Trier choose to follow this particular nutty
woman? Surely others could have offered something more insightful, and
maybe even meaningful. I found the characters&#x27; behavior...unlikely,
even given the circumstances that we later come to appreciate. Many,
many books and movies (both fictional and not) have covered the topic
of people facing impending doom. Personally, I prefer a combination of
the Hemingway hero and Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s main character in Cat&#x27;s Cradle:
fight with dignity to the end, but then thumb your nose at the world.
Like Breaker Morant: &#x22;Shoot straight, you bastards! Don&#x27;t make a mess
of it!&#x22; OK, the subject deserves a variety of treatments, but I found
this one less than compelling.
