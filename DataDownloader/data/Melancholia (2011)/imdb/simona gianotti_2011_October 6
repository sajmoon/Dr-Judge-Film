The incipit of the movie, offering wonderful tableaux vivants arranged
on a dreamlike progression, on the notes of a ravishing classical
music, made me soon realize I was going to see something aesthetically
refined and artfully conceived. And indeed, it was. The first part is
set mainly inside a wonderful mansion in the countryside, but the
beauty of nature outside is strongly opposed to the ugliness of human
relationships inside, human sympathy is absent, although a wedding
party is being held. The second part is dominated by Nature, beautiful
and threatening at the same time, and it is marked by a crescendo of
emotional anxiety until the final impressive ending.<br /><br />No flaws in the execution: perfect location, stunning photography,
intelligent screenplay, sharp shooting, not to mention the chiaroscuro
play in the nighttime scenes... And the cast is simply superb: I found
Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s performance as bewitching, and mesmerizing, probably
the best and more mature of her career up date, and the pairing with
Charlotte Gainsbourg proves intense and strongly felt.<br /><br />There&#x27;s certainly a contrast between the pessimism of the whole
picture, where the world, humanity, seems to deserve dissolution, as
the natural consequence to the lack of any real sense, and the formal
perfection of the work of art representing this apocalyptic vision, as
if art were the only value in life, the only means to transcend this
existential emptiness. Whether you agree or not with the pessimistic
and apocalyptic vision, but from this director you cannot expect a
positive one, what is undeniable is the high visual quality and the
perfect execution of a great piece of cinema.
