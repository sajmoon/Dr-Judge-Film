''Melancholia'' - Lars von Trier's best work to date. The movie is 
about the nature of depression and how 2 sisters go through it. Kirsten 
Dunst (Justine) accepts her melancholia by the time a planet that was 
hiding behind the sun threatens to collide the Earth, while other 
sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg - Clair) is afraid to face the reality and 
her own personal emotions.

If you have any little doubt whether you want to watch this movie or 
not, you better don't, because this is not for everyone, and if you 
still want to see this then prepare yourself for what you're going to 
face. The movie is all about how Lars Von Trier sees the world, the 
people and the dearness between them. It's beautiful, it's real, it's 
disgusting, it's terrifying - it all depends on how you want to 
perceive this film. The opening and the ending scenes are mesmerizing! 
The music used in the film is taken from Wagner's ''Tristan and 
Isolde'' opera which fits the movie perfectly. Cinematography - amazes. 
Special effects, not for 3D, but are very realistic and breathtaking.

Kirsten Dunst gives us her best performance to date, forget the girl in 
Spider-man, this is a new level for her. She finally proves us how good 
she can be with the right movie choice. An Oscar nomination is on its 
way...

I'm not a fan of Lars and his movies, but this one had me at the edge 
of my seat to the last minute. 10/10
