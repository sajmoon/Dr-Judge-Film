This is very good movie, technically speaking. The picture is
outstanding, games of light and dark, sound design, its all there.
Acting is more then great, Kirstin is doing heck of a job, shes naked
with her huge tits, and all this happened to be done in
non-pornographic way. But, please.. This movie is no more then weird
apocalyptic drama with no turnovers.. What lacks in it is attempt to
save the world, but this movie is not at all some kind of metaphor; its
very straightforward, leaving little to debate about, and in the end
little to review and talk. I have no idea how it happened for this
movie to gain such a huge hype and praise, come on people...
