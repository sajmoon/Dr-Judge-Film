I saw this during the weekend and it is seriously very overrated. With
the exception perhaps of the opening and closing scenes it failed to
stir any emotion in me or provide any grounds for discussion/arguments.<br /><br />I am really amazed with the excited reviews here. It&#x27;s evident that
people are looking for things to like about it (beyond the opening and
closing which everyone more or less agrees were great). I have watched
many movies that were puzzling, confusing, surrealistic and the reviews
here often gave me some additional insight or things to think about. In
this case everyone is discussing technicalities due to the lack of
substance. We are reduced to marvel at the visuals, the superior acting
(which I also failed to see) or try to defend it by saying it was not
meant for the general public. One reviewer even goes on to say that it
was &#x22;Truly Trier-esque&#x22; &#x85; really?<br /><br />So what is the movie about you may ask. Before going to see it I
thought it would be about the reactions and feelings of people to their
impeding doom, but if it was about that I failed to see how. First of
all the risk to earth does not appear until half-way into the movie and
it remains just a risk (not a certainty) for most of it. I also doubt
that the movie was about the two sisters and their relationship with
each other. Mind you that these are the only two characters that are
explored - even the husband and son are little more than extras. So at
the end of the movie we know that Claire is an ordinary woman that
cares for her family (sister, husband and child) and is afraid of the
planet that is closing in on earth. No more no less, probably the
definition of ordinary. For Justine we know that she is moody then
depressed then psychic and finally calm(?). They don&#x27;t interact much,
in fact I would say that we know more about how Claire&#x27;s husband feels
about Justine than about how Justine feels about her sister.<br /><br />The way I see it, the movie is probably about the melancholia of LvT. I
guess he feels that people and their relationships are messed up, that
the world is being destroyed or should be at least and that no one
should miss it. Perhaps his therapist told him to express his feelings
and he went and made a movie about it. It would also explain why he
felt better when making it. In general I am a nice guy, but I don&#x27;t see
why I should care about any of it.<br /><br />This review may sound harsh, but this movie really annoyed me mainly
because the way I see it, it was and is a huge missed opportunity.
