Unrealistic. <br /><br />This planet in the movie is huge, it is the earth should worry about
changing orbit, not this planet.<br /><br />Long before the impact all things and people would fly into the space
because the gravity of this planet would overpower the gravity on
earth. <br /><br />In fact the earth would break into pieces before the actual impact.<br /><br />Long before the impact the cataclysmic events would happen, like high
winds, tsunamis, earthquakes, etc..<br /><br />If Earth would manage to stay put upon the impact, the least it could
do is to cast a shadow on the planet when it was that close.<br /><br />And what is with the 19th hole on the golf course, other than some
obscure snobby reference to the constantly reminded fact about the
number of holes on that golf course .<br /><br />Plus, watch out the number of the spoons in the father&#x27;s of the bride
pocket.<br /><br />Great movie idea, not new though, kind of reminds the Canadian &#x22;Last
Day on Earth&#x22;, and dozen of other movies, but all b-actors cast doesn&#x27;t
deliver beyond that.<br /><br />To my like, only Charlotte Gainsbourg managed to develop a character
with more than 2 dimensions. <br /><br />First 15-20 minutes look pretty.<br /><br />Good news - no chance of sequel.
