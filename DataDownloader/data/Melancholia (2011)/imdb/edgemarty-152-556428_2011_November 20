The first ten minutes were awesome. The last ten minutes were great!
But, that long period in between was tedious.<br /><br />The film had a great cast but the accents differed wildly. Are we to
believe these diverse looking and sounding people are all closely
related? Things could have been better. The director has talent. I
loved Breaking the Waves. I have not given up on Von Trier despite his
Canne interview. It will be interesting to see if this film wins any
awards. The story takes place at a golf course with a hotel on it. The
dysfunctional family and friends are mostly a loathsome bunch. Self
obsessed and quarrelsome, why did these people ever gather together is
a mystery.
