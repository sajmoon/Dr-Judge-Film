2011_September 27 
I saw the rating, and then I saw the movie. I really couldn&#x27;t
understand the rating. So I read most of the reviews. Wow, I must admit
that I&#x27;m very confused. How can anyone call this movie artistic? First
of all, I wanted to see the movie because of the actors/actresses. And
I also love artistic movies, and that&#x27;s what I was expecting to see.
But GOD, how could these actors, especially Kiefer Sutherland or John
Hurt, agree to play in this movie. Here&#x27;s my understanding of this
film: All the characters are either unstable/crazy, or they make no
sense at all. You can&#x27;t in any way sympathize with any of these
characters. Too much of the movie is filled by these characters staring
at whatever.<br /><br />Shaky camera for too long and for most parts of the film, too much that
makes you feel dizzy and sick, that you need to NOT to look at the
screen for awhile.<br /><br />Too many scenes of craziness and at the same time they are so slow that
you just want to forward them as fast as you can.<br /><br />The storyline is about the end of the world, which should make you sad
when it happens. It&#x27;s amazing that after more than 2 hours watching,
the last 2 minutes, when Melancholia collides into earth, you&#x27;re going
to be very happy. Because the movie actually ends.<br /><br />DO NOT watch this movie, DO NOT waist your time. The only thing you&#x27;ll
see is hours of boringness, meaningless and dizziness pictures.<br /><br />OR just watch the last 2 minutes...
