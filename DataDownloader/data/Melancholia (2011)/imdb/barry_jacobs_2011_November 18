It&#x27;s beyond belief how anyone can give this film a good rating. I
watched this film due to the high rating on this site and having never
left a film review before, feel obliged too, to save as much of the
rest of humanity as possible.<br /><br />The film starts off with an excruciating five minutes of art house
drivel, swiftly followed by a film with atrocious camera work, poor
acting and a tedious plot, only enlightened by a swift cheer as the
film, the planet and hopefully Mr Von Trier&#x27;s ambition to create any
more films are delightfully terminated. <br /><br />A masterpiece from the Uwe Boll school of film making.
