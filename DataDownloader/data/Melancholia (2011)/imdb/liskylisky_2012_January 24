If you&#x27;re thinking of seeing this movie, my advice would be - don&#x27;t
bother. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a total waste of time and money. I was
expecting so much more, especially with such a promising cast, but I
was very disappointed. Hard to imagine how it could win any awards -
competition must have been poor. The fine talent of good actors cannot
compensate for this poor effort by writer/director Lars Von Trier. A
few people walked out half way through, some muttering comments of
frustration and dissatisfaction. I felt ripped off also as I struggled
to stay awake because of such a drawn-out and boring story- line. A bad
investment.
