&#x200E;&#x27;Melancholia&#x27; starts with one of the most beautifully captured
prologue scenes in cinema. It&#x27;s apocalyptic, melancholic and yet
beautiful, yes, beautiful. The movie tries to explore relationships
between two sisters as one of them has got just married and earth is
about to get shattered by a collision with a planet called,
&#x27;Melancholy&#x27;. It&#x27;s pretty obvious here why Von Trier chooses this name
for this planet, isn&#x27;t it?<br /><br />The movie isn&#x27;t your typical sci-fi adventure, those who are familiar
with Lars Von Trier&#x27;s works would know that already. It, most
importantly, tries to explore psychological and behavioral study of the
people who are attending the wedding, at a grandeur palace, I might
add. When your planet is about to be doomed, how much importance would
one give to things like social nicety or hiding your honest emotions?
No, Lars Von Trier makes his characters emotionally naked. There is a
sense of desperation but with honesty in each unpredictable actions of
the characters. And also, yes, melancholy.<br /><br />Melancholia is definitely a work of art. And like all the genuine artsy
creations, it might just connect with you or not.
