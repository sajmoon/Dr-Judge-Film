Not an easy task. In fact, to even attempt to do this would not only be
risky for ones career, but in the case of Lars Von Trier, laying
oneself bare for the world to tease apart piece by piece. However, Mr.
Von Trier has not only seamlessly coerced us into the inner workings of
a clinically depressed mind, he has already done the teasing apart for
us.<br /><br />Every single piece is there for us to see, laid out in plain sight,
within every frame. Not obviously, not cheaply and not in any crude
manner. No, he has placed every detail with such creativity and
cleverness it is easy to see how this Art house-esque masterpiece will
be thrown aside by many who do not realise what is in front of them as
&#x22;Too slow, too pointless&#x22;.<br /><br />Drawing from the depths of his own experiences with depression, this
film is rich with detail and poignancy. After watching and indeed
absorbing the film, I still find it fascinatingly intriguing how Von
Trier has managed to condense all the aspects of a fractured mind into
two hours and two parts of cinematography. I cannot help but think a
large part of himself is within each scene with Justine.<br /><br />As the story unfolds over the course of several days we see a stark
contrast not only between sisters, but between the various facets of
Justines character. This itself will leave the thinking viewer with
questions that test our own sense of acceptance, of right and wrong.<br /><br />Cinematically, the film is beautifully shot. Again simplicity and
careful use of intimate dialogue builds an atmosphere so heavy and
intense yet joyously easy on the senses. Everything is there for use to
absorb, but in such a delicate way you may not even realise what you
have taken in.<br /><br />Is this film a mass, cross-the-board hit? No. There will be many who
unfortunately let the meanings and thoughts float by them without
reaching out a hand and taking hold of the key themes. But for those
who see the beauty in the darkness of depression, this film will leave
you lulling over questions for days after.<br /><br />Lars Von Trier has not only triumphed, once again, in the cinematic
arena, he has given all the gift of witnessing a journey so dark that
the destination will be be nothing short of a blessing in disguise.
