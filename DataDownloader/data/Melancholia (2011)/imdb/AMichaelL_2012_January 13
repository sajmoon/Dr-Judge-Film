It is with this principle Von Trier made this film (look it up, he has
been quoted as saying this). This is a movie about accepting fate in a
system of disbelief. It has a stark and, at times deeply depressing,
message, but it is so profoundly laid out on film. This, like Tree of
Life, is highly divisive visual poetry, although I would argue their is
less agnosticism here, and more pure nihilism. This is a film that
asks, &#x22;what if THIS life is all we have?&#x22; very directly and
beautifully. Dunst deserves an Oscar for her role as the depressed
central character, but I would be surprised if she even got a
nomination given this film&#x27;s super indie nature and Cannes success.<br /><br />If you know anything about German romanticism - this is probably the
best use of it in film, in America - ever, and in general - in many
years.<br /><br />See this movie, it will likely conjure up feelings in you much like a
great Chopin composition, and very few movies get that kind of
comparison from me.
