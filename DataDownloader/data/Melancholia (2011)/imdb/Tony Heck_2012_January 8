&#x22;The Earth is evil, we don&#x27;t need to grieve for it. Nobody will miss
it.&#x22; Today is Justine&#x27;s (Dunst) wedding day and it&#x27;s time to see her
family again. Her sister and brother-in-law paid for it and while it
was a huge wedding no one seems happy. To make matters worse there are
news reports of a huge planet that is heading toward Earth. This is one
of the hardest movies I have ever had to review. There are some movies
that you put in and they are mindless entertainment. There are some
that make you think. Then there are movies like this. This movie is
very very deep and full of symbolism, and as much as I&#x27;d like to I
don&#x27;t understand a lot of it. Much like &#x22;Tree Of Life&#x22; there was much
more going on in this then just the surface stuff. The acting by Dunst
blew me away and this is a good movie, but very hard to grasp (for me
at least). Overall, a good movie but one that you must open your mind
for in order to grasp all of it. I have to say that this is not my kind
of movie though in the way that it seemed to try to hard to be smarter
then everyone. I give it a B-.
