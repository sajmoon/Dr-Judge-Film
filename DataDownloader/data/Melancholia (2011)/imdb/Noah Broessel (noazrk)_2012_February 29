I just saw a trailer for this. Before I saw the title I said &#x22;Oh, this
is that movie ANOTHER EARTH&#x22; that I heard about but forgot to watch.<br /><br />NOPE! This is a DIFFERENT movie that just happens to be 1. A foreign
movie 2. Made in 2011 &#x26; 3. the plot is an emotional drama tied into the
history shattering event of another planet being discovered that is
just like Earth (a blue planet).<br /><br />As they teach us in High School, history tends to repeat itself as
quite often these types of movies come out in pairs in the same year.<br /><br />Off my head I remember Armaggedon/Deep Impact, Dante&#x27;s Peak/Volcano and
now Melancholia/Earth 2.<br /><br />I still want to watch both but I often laugh at how the same plot goes
through different movie studios within a similar timeframe.
