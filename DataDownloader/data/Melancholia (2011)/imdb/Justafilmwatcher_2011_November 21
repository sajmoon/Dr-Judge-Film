All I can say is that &#x27;Melancholia&#x27; is on a par with &#x27;2001&#x27;.<br /><br />Simply, you&#x27;ll either be captivated or you won&#x27;t. Some viewers of
&#x27;2001&#x27; react with hostility upon the conclusion of that film. You can
explain it to them over and over and they just see garbage.<br /><br />&#x27;Melancholia&#x27; is to emotion as &#x27;2001&#x27; was to intellect. It forces one
into the most emotional extreme there is the same way &#x27;2001&#x27; forces one
to grasp a greater intellectual construct.<br /><br />Those who call films like these &#x22;garbage&#x22; simply don&#x27;t get it. But it&#x27;s
simple, really: the two films posit there may be something out there
bigger than we are.<br /><br />98/100
