This is a film that has undeniably split both audiences and critics
and, upon reading reviews, I became very excited as I knew this could
be a film I could potentially adore. And, thankfully, it was.<br /><br />This is by no means a film for everyone and I can well understand why.
What Lars attempts to convey - in my opinion - is pure emotion and, at
times, complete nothingness. The downside of this (for some) is that he
may lose track of a number of the fundamental principles of
storytelling, namely character development and insight. So, if you want
to see this film and ask &#x22;why?&#x22; throughout then go ahead, but such
questions will most likely yield no answer.<br /><br />Instead, I encourage one to not necessarily engage this film on a
realist level, because I don&#x27;t believe this is what was intended.
Indeed, the end of the world is a readily attainable idea, but it is
something we as a society have never faced; and it is thus an
inexplicable reality. What do we know of the end of the world? We know
there is death and we know there is emotion. Further, we know there is
soon nothingness and thus futility.<br /><br />You may think I have gone off on an unnecessary rant but I don&#x27;t think
I have. I think these are concepts Lars actively utilises and in such
an artful and commendable manner.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen this film then please do, because you might just
love it as much as I and others do. It&#x27;s a rare pleasure to find a film
like this, and I almost gave it a 10.
