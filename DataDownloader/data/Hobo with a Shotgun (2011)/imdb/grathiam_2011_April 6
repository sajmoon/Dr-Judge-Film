I&#x27;m being overly generous providing a 2 rating, having been lulled into
watching Hobo based on the early pedantic and high marks some reviewers
provided. Comparing Hobo to Machete is laughable. Machete was an
excellent spoof of grind house/exploitation films and it was well done,
with a decent script, camera-work and passable acting. Hobo is just
another very low budget flick, with talentless actors that is surely
oriented towards prurient and misguided interests.<br /><br />Hobo is so bad it makes the worst of John Water&#x27;s Pink Flamingos film
seem like they should have been Oscar award contender! <br /><br />While Rutger Hauer has never been a major star, I wonder if he feels
embarrassed seeing the final production of this B- file?<br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste your money and time...avoid seeing Hobo!!
