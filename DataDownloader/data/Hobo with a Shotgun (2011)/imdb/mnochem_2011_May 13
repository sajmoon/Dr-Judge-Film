Is this a good movie? <br /><br />Well, if this movie intends to be a B-, or rather a C- (well, D- etc.)
-movie, than it succeeds at being that. And I love B-movies (or C-, see
above). I&#x27;ve seen the likes of Castle Freak, The Room and Ricky-Oh. And
yes, they are awful on many levels. But one thing all B-movies share is
some sort of passion, a true belief from the makers that they intend to
make something which is better than what they (probabably) actually
produced. &#x27;Hobo&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have that, not even in a post-modern kind of
way. Unlike, for instance, Planet Terror, which is a bad idea done very
well (and therefor in my opinion a good movie), this is a bad film done
very badly. But just not bad enough to give it the kind of satisfaction
you expect from an extended Grindhouse trailer. <br /><br />The acting is horrifying (even Hauer looks like he&#x27;s only ever acted in
the Westborough rendition of &#x27;Our Town&#x27;, and he&#x27;s the best thing about
this movie!), the script is appalling (characters disappearing, really
cheesy but unfunny one-liners, metaphors thought up by two-year-olds),
the music (just bad), the lighting, the set-design, everything is
awful. And you get the feeling that the makers try to get away with it,
because &#x27;it was intended like that&#x27;. Wow, how smart! So you have to
like it or else you don&#x27;t get it. <br /><br />Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work that way. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to care
for characters that are so flatly written and so badly portrayed. Why
should I care if they live or die or get maimed? (some actors are so
atrociously bad that you want them to disappear as soon as possible,
and that&#x27;s not just the bad guys!) The story veers off in all kinds of
directions which makes it difficult to keep up with the story and the
main characters, and the most interesting character(s), the Plague,
don&#x27;t get nearly enough screen time. Meanwhile you constantly get the
feeling that this movie tries to &#x27;really say something&#x27; about the state
of our society, (digs at &#x27;Bum Fight&#x27;, television and homelessness for
instance fall flat because it&#x27;s all delivered in such a wooden manner). <br /><br />I do get it: this movie tries to be a celebration of bad filmmaking.
And there are some chuckles to be had at how bad this is. But
unfortunately a bad idea done badly still equals a bad movie. This is
plain awful, but just not awful enough to make it smart, funny or good.
