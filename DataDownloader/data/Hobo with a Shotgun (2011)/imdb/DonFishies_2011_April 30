Writing a review for a film like Hobo with a Shotgun is an incredibly
uneasy task. While it would be far too easy to pick the film apart for
how truly awful it is, there is more than enough to admire about it as
well. For one, it has such a brilliantly succinct title that sums up
exactly what you will see when watching: a nameless Hobo (Rutger Hauer)
dispatching criminals with a shotgun. The plot, or what little
semblance of one that exists, throws in corrupt businessmen, rampant
drug use in a rapidly decaying small town, the stereotypical hooker
with the heart of gold, a subplot involving getting enough money to
start a lawn mowing business; the list is nearly endless.<br /><br />But I digress, for it is obvious after seeing the trailers for this
film, and the faux trailer that inspired it four years ago (which I
sadly was never able to see on the big screen), that the only reason
anyone would see Jason Eisner&#x27;s ridiculously twisted vision is so they
can watch the Hobo deliver justice the only way he knows how.<br /><br />And for the better part of the film, that is precisely what Eisner
whips at the camera in the most grisly ways possible. This is quite
likely the most graphically bloody and gory film I have seen in months,
and the film revels in every moment it spills. While the shotgun is the
primary way most of the people in the film meet their end, Eisner does
not stop there. Toasters, flamethrowers, harpoon guns, and even an ice
skate help round out some of the other messy death scenes that occur
during the movie. Even with the film being a Canadian production, I was
rather impressed at the attention to detail in these scenes. Adding in
the effects to ruin the picture quality (ala Tarantino and Rodriguez)
was also a very nice touch.<br /><br />I also must point out how gutsy Eisner is. For such a ferociously
violent and utterly disgusting film, he still manages to push the
envelope far beyond the realm of bad taste in more than a few scenes.
In one specific instance, I was completely shocked at what was taking
place on screen. Not just because it was one of the darkest things ever
committed to celluloid, and not just because it was twistedly
hilarious, but because Eisner had actually thought of this idea in the
first place. While the torture porn genre has led to some rather
peculiar imagery in the past decade, none of them really stuck with me
weeks after seeing the film. Some of the things that happen in this
movie, including the previously referenced scene, made me literally
sick to my stomach and they have stuck with me since. <br /><br />But for all I enjoyed about Hobo with a Shotgun, the weeks since
watching it have given me some time to reflect on it &#x96; which is never a
good thing for this kind of film. The perverse and absurdly hilarious
nature of the film is truly meant for a certain kind of audience. But
even taking that into account, it still falls short of a few
expectations.<br /><br />I will not attempt to decipher and dissect the script, as it would be a
waste of time. It exists specifically to allow the hobo to enter the
town, decide it needs to get cleaned up, and then gives him the time to
take it upon himself to do it. But even for such a cut and dry film
(running a swift 86 minutes), it feels like Eisner had to pad it out
with nonsensical drivel to flesh it out to feature-length. While the
first two acts juggle between the simplistic plot and superfluous
scenes (some work, many do not), the third act is just a mess. The
section involving &#x22;The Plague&#x22; is simply ludicrous, and does not belong
in the film at all. While I laughed at them fighting off a squid (yes,
you read that right), I have no idea what point it served the rest of
the film. It throws off the pacing, and when the abrupt and
horrifically disappointing ending finally takes place soon afterwards,
it makes it feel more like Eisner had no idea where to go after he set
up all the scenes from the trailer<br /><br />Acting wise, I am still unsure how to react to the performances. While
it looks like the majority of actors are having a great time making the
film, there are no real standout performers outside of Hauer (although
I will give credit to Molly Dunsworth for taking the kind of beating
Bruce Campbell made look easy in the Evil Dead films). But then, Hauer
is a bit of an enigma as well. He carries the film brilliantly, and
never cops out once to the joke the film really is. He is stern, and
deadly serious. He plays the Hobo exactly to how you would have
imagined it. But there are more than a few instances where he looks
genuinely disappointing and appalled to have ever considered being
involved in a movie like this. We only catch fleeting glimpses of this
disgusted look, but it is more than apparent that he is not truly
satisfied at all times.<br /><br />While there is a lot to really like about Hobo with a Shotgun, there is
a lot to dislike. As preposterously fun as it was to watch, the film is
ridiculously uneven, even by grindhouse standards. It will likely
please fans of the genre, or anyone who loves seeing absurdly played
out moments of violence and carnage, but there will be some who will be
just as disappointed as I was. The wait from faux trailer to legit film
was lengthy, but I think they should have still put in a bit more
effort to make it a cohesive final project. <br /><br />7/10.<br /><br />(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).
