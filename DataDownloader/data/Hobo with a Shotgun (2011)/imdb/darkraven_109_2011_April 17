HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN... with a title like that it&#x27;s obvious that no one
should take the movie seriously and just have a fun time watching it.
If you were able to see the fake trailer that was featured with the
Tarantino/Rodriguez team-up GRINDHOUSE then you know what to expect.
For those who haven&#x27;t, all you&#x27;re waiting for is a no holds barred
action packed gore fest.<br /><br />While movies like MACHETE successfully bring back the grindhouse days,
they fall to trying to look more serious than they have to (MACHETE had
an out of place immigration message). Thankfully HOBO avoids this with
ease. I don&#x27;t know if the director had some underlying message about
the homeless here but it isn&#x27;t the focus of the film and that&#x27;s a good
thing; the main focus of the film is the gore, action and the overall
70&#x27;s vibe.<br /><br />HOBO doesn&#x27;t bow down to the censors, unleashing as much bloody mayhem
as possible in its short running time (roughly one hour and twenty
minutes) and that&#x27;s what makes it so memorable (at least for me). In a
time when every single film has to be family friendly, stuff like HOBO
WITH A SHOTGUN stand out and deliver the goods to the starving R-rated
movie loving audience.<br /><br />The characters are all great, the psychopaths of Scum City are all
properly unhinged and bloodthirsty and Rutger Hauer&#x27;s rendition of HOBO
is a lot more effective than Dave Brunt&#x27;s already awesome Hobo in the
original fake trailer. The story is very simple (vigilante vs a crime
lord) but that&#x27;s not a problem here as it only helps invoke the proper
vigilante film feel.<br /><br />Overall this movie knows how to have fun... R-rated fun at that but
still entertaining. Though it&#x27;s kind of sad to know that this film will
end up more as a cult classic instead of a high-grossing R-rated film
like most of Tarantino&#x27;s works (and HOBO deserves the income), it&#x27;s not
only worth checking out but it&#x27;s a definite must watch especially if
you&#x27;re part of the aforementioned R-rated loving audience.
