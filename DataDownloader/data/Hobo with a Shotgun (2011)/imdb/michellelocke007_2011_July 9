2011_July 9 
saw the trailer for this and decided that i was going to get my hands
on this film once it hit the home DVD market. soon enough it was
released in a two-disc special edition complete with a set of hobo
postcards. i didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this film and was
pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed watching it. this film was
shot on a budget of 3 million dollars and i loved what was produced and
show on screen.<br /><br />the only actor that i was remotely familiar with was that of rutger
hauer of blade runner fame. i thought he suited the role very well of
the nameless hobo who enforces his own version of street justice when
he grows tired of the crime, lawlessness and rampant destruction of the
town he is now a part of. his weather-beaten features tells a story of
a life lived hard and ruined by a series of unfortunate events that led
him to becoming a hobo.<br /><br />the film is loaded with gory death scenes which includes but not
limited to a decapitation, a foot being smashed with a sledgehammer and
of all things someone getting their penis blown off with a shotgun. the
effects were realistic enough to make me cringe, so kudos to the people
responsible for the special effects.<br /><br />i have seen a lot of exploitation flicks in my time most recently,
machete and planet terror but this one was hands down the best. the
title alone won me over. it kept me entertained from start to finish
and that&#x27;s all i was looking for. a film that didn&#x27;t take itself too
seriously, the actors were giving over the top performances and having
fun with it and it had enough gore, violence and nudity to keep me
glued to my chair.
