very surprised to se rutger hauer star in such poor movie even though
he likes to try odd b projects even this is far below him.<br /><br />the movie is pretty low budget. acting is really cheesy and poor. it is
basically about a hobo in a town where everyone is a sadist psycho.
buckets and buckets of blood and poorly made over the top violence
where you can apparently break and arm in two with one hand etc.<br /><br />weird effects like red light and smoke inside a hospital is just one of
the weird stuff that don&#x27;t make any sense.<br /><br />i think it actually dragged some pretty good actors below their own
level.<br /><br />brian downey did really good in lexx but here its just kinda painful to
watch him act.<br /><br />rutger and molly really struggels to keep the movie floating despite
what it is but they are overpowered by how bad the entire production
is.<br /><br />basically you can tell the actors cant themselves really take it
serious or believe in the mess of story it is.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve seen a lot of b movies and ultragore but this is probably the
worst one so far.<br /><br />save your money rent something else.<br /><br />this is just junk.
