Its over-the-top gore is intentional, and its cheese factor is
exponential. It succeeds because it declares what it wants to be right
from the start and doesn&#x27;t stray from its main goal, to hearken back to
those low-budget exploitation films of the 1970s.<br /><br />You probably know that the movie&#x27;s genesis was the Grindhouse duo of
movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez; fake
trailers separated the two showings. The trailers were so successful
that plans were launched to make full-length movies of them, and Hobo
with a Shotgun is the second, following Rodriguez&#x27;s own Machete.<br /><br />The title is self explanatory, and the plot is simple. A nameless hobo,
played with grit and glee by Rutger Hauer, arrives in a new town,
anxious to start a new life for himself. But it&#x27;s a town run by a
merciless boss and his Ray-Ban-wearing sons; crime isn&#x27;t just in
fashion, it&#x27;s the law. There&#x27;s a child-molesting Santa Claus. Every cop
is corrupt. It&#x27;s like walking through Detroit at night. I kid, I&#x27;ve
never had to do that. But it&#x27;s bad.<br /><br />And soon our antihero is embroiled in do-gooding on the behalf of a
put-upon prostitute (Molly Dunsworth), saving her from the inevitable
rape by one of the sons. And then he gets his hand on the titular gun,
and there&#x27;s nary a scene that&#x27;s not absolutely soaked in crimson from
thence on.<br /><br />Look, don&#x27;t look for logic and realism here. It&#x27;s not supposed to be
real, it&#x27;s supposed to be visceral violence. It&#x27;s supposed to gross you
out. There are decapitations. There are children murdered in cold
blood. There are ice skates to the back. There are large, knight-like
warriors &#x96; a pair known as The Plague &#x96; who look like a cross between
Monty Python&#x27;s The Black Knight and a barbecue grill. There are
entrails and sundry organs. It is not a movie for kids, is what I&#x27;m
getting at here. Heck, it&#x27;s not even rated.<br /><br />So, obviously, most people out there aren&#x27;t going to like this movie,
full stop. It&#x27;s not only not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, it&#x27;s really the cup
of tea of only a small percentage of us. But those who do like this
will really get into it. It captures the spirit of the time it&#x27;s trying
to encapsulate. It&#x27;s horrific, slimy, disturbing, degenerate fun.
