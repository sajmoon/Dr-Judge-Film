There are all types of films I love, from Sergio Leone classics to the
Lloyd Kaufmann Troma flicks of years past and present. Hell, as an
indie filmmaker myself it is always nice to turn to indie genre cinema
to see what the low budget guys are churning out because in the
plethora of these films a few gems stick out from time to time... HOBO
is one of those gems.<br /><br />Hollywood as watered us down year after year with sequels, remakes, and
just plain garbage, and the true visceral hardcore cinema us
Generations X-er&#x27;s grew up on has been long gone, unless you&#x27;re a gen
x-er who dabbles in independent filmmaking.<br /><br />HOBO, the new feature film based upon the Canadian Faux Grindhouse
trailer attached to the Canadian prints of Grindhouse is now making
waves left and right around the world.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer, in top form, is a homeless man who strolls on into to
Hope Town, a crime ridden haven that would most likely be compared to
Hell on Earth.<br /><br />HOBO, goes completely over the top, and I mean completely over. It
crosses plenty of boundaries that have made people stand-up and cheer,
or jeer depending on your particular stance on the subject matter at
hand.<br /><br />Is HOBO a social commentary on today&#x27;s world... Maybe. I didn&#x27;t go into
HOBO expecting some type of commentary, I went into it hoping for some
entertainment and it delivered. Now I will say that HOBO might not been
as good without RUTGER... the film does meander at times and some of
the other performances, while cringe worthy, do help this cheesy
exploitation flick, but it is RUTGER who really makes the film become
remember-able.<br /><br />The film does have some moments that most people would immediately
criticize as shoddy filmmaking, but they in fact add to the indie
nature of the film. A couple of times I did see some fundamental
filmmaking rules broken, but my response to that is... who decided
these rules are in fact &#x22;The Rules&#x22; I myself break a lot of the rules,
180, CU, MCU, establishing shots etc... why do I break&#x27;em... because I
don&#x27;t care, and neither should anyone else.<br /><br />Genre film audiences I think will truly enjoy HOBO... however, the more
mainstream crowd is going to immediately switch this off because of the
violence/exploitative nature of the material... which is a shame
because HOBO is probably one of the best VIGILANTE films ever made. I
kid you not. For any person who has been fed up with the day to day
life of crime and other issues in their world, HOBO helps you feel like
you got the revenge you have so wanted but are unable to act upon
because in reality... jail may not be your singular goal in life.<br /><br />HOBO is definitely not for the faint of heart. So those with weak
stomach&#x27;s should seriously avoid this film... but it will be a sad loss
because if you enjoy over the top action, you get your fill here frame
after frame after frame.<br /><br />So from one indie filmmaker to another... thumbs up cast &#x26; crew of
HOBO. JOB WELL DONE <br /><br />Gary Ugarek 8 stars out of 10.
