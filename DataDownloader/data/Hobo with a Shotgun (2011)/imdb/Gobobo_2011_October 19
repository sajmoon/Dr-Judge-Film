This film is quite original, in how awful it is. It&#x27;s ridiculously bad
but not in a good way. I thought the start was humorous, and had a real
old-feel to it. I was expecting an old-fashioned style of update on a
spaghetti western (if that makes sense). <br /><br />What happened during the film, though, was that I just got more and
more disappointed. It was cringe-making in just about every sense you
could imagine. The dialogue was terrible, the acting (apart from Hauer)
was abysmal, the effects were awful, the story was a joke, the
characterization was pathetic, the soundtrack was useless and the
continuity was the worst I&#x27;ve seen on screen. I felt bad for Hauer
after his wonderful parts in previous movies, and I don&#x27;t understand
why he was cast for this part? Did he do something to someone&#x27;s wife in
Hollywood? How could his agent have let him appear in this trash?
