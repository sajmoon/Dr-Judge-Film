A+<br /><br />Over-the-top gore, a retro-style score, colorful cinematography, and
Rutager Hayer fuel this cult movie into the deep chasms of my heart.
It&#x27;s a tribute to the grind house cinema of old, and it&#x27;s a
blood-stained thrill ride. It&#x27;s a rather simple story at a glance, but
its visuals speak for themselves. Any action junkie will be drawn to
the brutal violence, but I find other qualities to admire in it. Like
its depiction of a world gone completely mad, the careful use of the
camera and set design to allude to the notion that religion can&#x27;t
prevent this. Note how the main antagonists sit at a replica of the
Last Supper while performing heinous acts of animalistic malice.<br /><br />The performances aren&#x27;t too shabby and Rutager, whom many will
recognize from Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22;, is just BAD ASS. I like
Molly Dunsworth and the duo of Nick Bateman and Gregory Smith are
rather enjoyable. And boy do I love the Plague. What they lack in
dialogue they make up for in pure presence. And the score by Alexander
Rosborough is awesome. I&#x27;m just hoping there&#x27;s going to be a release of
some kind.<br /><br />The use of color is vibrant and to die for, and all together is just a
memorable and silly movie. General audiences may be put off by what
they see but I highly recommend it for fans of cult cinema.
