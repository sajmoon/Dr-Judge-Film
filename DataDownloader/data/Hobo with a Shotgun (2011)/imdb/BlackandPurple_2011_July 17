I remember 2007, I turned 21, was finally able to buy beer, and the
exploitation tapped into movie audiences all over again like it was the
1970s on 42nd Street in New York. It was due in large part to Quentin
Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez&#x27; movie Grindhouse. Part of the gimmick
for that movie was to have fake trailers in between the two films. QT &#x26;
RR also had a contest for best fake movie trailer. The winner was a
Canadian filmmaker, Jason Eisener, who made Hobo with a Shotgun. When I
heard that it would be made into a real movie with Rutger Hauer, I was
most excited.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays a nameless hobo who wonders into the town of &#x22;Hope
Town.&#x22; And because it is overrun by crime lords and corrupt peace
officers, the town&#x27;s new name is &#x22;Scum Town.&#x22; Either way it&#x27;s worse
than Camden, New Jersey and Detroit combined. This hobo finds that the
town is overrun by vicious criminals such as bumfight filmmakers,
sadistic punk rockers, pedophile Santas, dirty pimps who prostitute
teenage girls, bank robbers, and motorcycle gangs. At the center of
this is the Drake (Brian Downey), a white suit-wearing crimelord who
owns the city with his two degenerate letterman-wearing sons, Slick
(Gregory Smith) and Ivan (Nick Bateman). Overnight, this hobo gets the
support of scared parents, as well as a sympathetic hooker, Abby (Molly
Dunsworth). However, the cunning and fearful Drake starts a riot,
encouraging citizens to lynch mob homeless people to kill the hobos, so
that this evil Drake can regain his power. Can this hobo with a Dixie
Cup of change, change the town? <br /><br />Wow, this film was a real carnival of carnage. Some of the scenes in
this movie were some of the most demented that I have ever seen in my
entire life. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it. Come on, there is no way that
one can go wrong with a title like Hobo with a Shotgun. Overall, it is
a great send up of the 70s and 80s exploitation vigilante heroes. Some
of the lines here are just too ridiculous for words, but you should
listen for yourself. I watched this film with a group of friends, and
we had a blast watching it and laughing and drinking beer.<br /><br />With the exception of Rutger Hauer, the acting was pretty terrible. The
Drake&#x27;s two sons, their acting, almost brought back nightmares of Tommy
Wiseau in The Room. That was the only negative part about this movie,
at least in my opinion, which on this blog DOES matter. If you&#x27;re a
complete prude who hates cussing, drinking, violence, nudity,
flamethrowers, prostitutes, vigilante bums, dark humor, etc., you&#x27;re
gonna hate this film. I&#x27;d recommend putting it back and going home to
watch &#x22;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&#x22; with your family. But
I hate political correctness, so, I&#x27;m buying the blu Ray for this.<br /><br />If you really want to have a great movie watching party, I strongly
recommend Hobo with a Shotgun. It&#x27;s good, unclean fun for the whole
family.
