Everyone who is about to watch this film, will know EXACTLY what is
going to happen, <br /><br />there will be a hobo, and he will be lonely, and you will feel sorry
for him, and for the other (very few) honest people in the film. That
hobo will one day have enough, and get a shotgun (try not to remember
shotguns need bullets, and to shoot 100 people, you&#x27;ll need 100
cartridges), and get revenge.<br /><br />So knowing this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed... because that&#x27;s what
happens. <br /><br />Watched this the other day, 08/08/11, and living in London, the town in
this film looked like what was happening outside, gave me a few
ideas...
