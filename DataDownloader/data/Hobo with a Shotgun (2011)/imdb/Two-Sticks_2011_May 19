Hobo with a Shotgun is by far the WORST piece of filmmaking I have ever
seen, and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of really bad student films. This piece of
crap is so bad it is not even fun to watch to see how bad it is. I kept
thinking it had to have some deeper meaning that I&#x27;m just not getting.
The special effects are horrible. The acting is bad. Rutger Hauer is
wasted. The violence is way over the top and very offensive. I cringed
numerous times watching this garbage. The only good thing I can say
about it is that it had some interesting lighting through out it.
Otherwise I want the 90 minutes back that it took me to watch this
&#x22;film&#x22;. It is awful.
