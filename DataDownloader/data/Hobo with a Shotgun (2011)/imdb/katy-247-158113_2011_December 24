I watched this movie today. I was hoping for something more. Rutger
Hauer is a very well liked actor to me, and his acting was still good
but the story was set be be totally unbelievable, and I think that was
intensionally done that way. Extremely far fetched to say the least.
Where as this had the makings to be at least a 7 rating for me it fell
way short of what I was hoping for. It reminds me of movies based on
video games, and I was never a fan of those. Of the four of us that
watched it together, one of us said it stunk terribly while 3 of us
said it was barely worth watching at best, So if you like a lot of
blood flying with lots of action with a very weak story then you might
think its OK, but for the 4 of us that watched it today it get 4 thumbs
down.
