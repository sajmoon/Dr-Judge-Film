That&#x27;s right, I watched it.<br /><br />Like Machete, this is another fake trailer from Grindhouse that was
turned into a full-length film. Unlike Machete however, it&#x27;s not very
good.<br /><br />This movie is really just an excuse for some gratuitous violence for no
reason. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love a good horror flick and I don&#x27;t mind
the occasional violent action film but, a movie needs to have more to
it than just violence.<br /><br />The plot, what there is of it, revolves around Hobo (Rutger Hauer) who
rides the rails into an unnamed city that is a modern day Sodom.
Depravity rules here, and the entire city is run by a gangster named
Drake and his two psychopathic sons; Ivan, and Slick. Hobo is just
trying to mind his own business but eventually he gets dragged into the
action when he stops a hooker from being raped by Slick. Hobo takes
Slick to the police station but soon discovers that Police are just as
corrupt as the criminals. Hobo is beaten by Slick and the police and
left for dead. He survives however, and decides that it&#x27;s time to take
some revenge. Cue the shotgun.<br /><br />The thing that made Machete entertaining was that it never took itself
seriously. It was pure camp and filled with humorous one liners and
enjoyable, over the top, action sequences. Hobo with a Shotgun is just
a humorless gore fest. Genitals explodes, hands are cut off with lawn
mowers, it goes on and on.<br /><br />Bottom line? This movie sucks. Don&#x27;t waste your time.
