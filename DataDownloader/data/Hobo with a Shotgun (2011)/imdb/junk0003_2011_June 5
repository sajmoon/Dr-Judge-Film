I have seen all of Tarantino&#x27;s and Rodriguez movies, and thought this
would be a fun movie in the same spirit as Grindhouse or Machete. This
is is AWFUL. How can anyone say its a great movie. I can&#x27;t see how this
movie gets above 6 on IMDb rating (rated higher than Hall Pass?). It
should be 4 or less. <br /><br />Honestly the acting is OK, some lines are funny, but the idea is badly
executed, the violence and gore is so low budget, its sad (using 2
bumper cars to smash a guys head like a ripe tomatoe. really??? bumper
cars go like 3 mph!!!). This could have been a much better movie, but
the really dropped the ball. I really tried to like this movie, but it
misses on so many levels, its sad. They should have mad it an outright
parody.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this movie. Or watch it and post your
honest review on here (you&#x27;ll see how bad of a movie it is).
