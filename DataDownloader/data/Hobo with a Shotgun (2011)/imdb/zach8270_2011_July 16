I&#x27;m not going to tell you about the plot because there isn&#x27;t one.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to describe the acting because it&#x27;s putrid.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to comment on the filming because it&#x27;s crummy.<br /><br />It looks like a high budget Troma movie, but nowhere near as
entertaining. It&#x27;s an hour and a half of my life that I&#x27;ll never get
back. The movie industry really is in dire straits if things like this
are getting produced.<br /><br />It&#x27;s trying to be something it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s trying to be a throwback to
the 1970&#x27;s true Grindhouse movies, but it&#x27;s nowhere even close.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t bother. Poor Rutger Hauer.
