This seemed just like a Troma film to me--over the top nonsensical
wackiness combined with over the top cruelty and violence. The only
real difference here is the presence of Rutger Hauer. Hauer has such a
command of the screen that he seems to be spliced in from an entirely
different movie than the rest of the actors. He only has a couple of
scenes with any real dialog, but they are clear standouts--mini nutjob
soliloquies that wouldn&#x27;t have been out of place in an art-house film.
But Rutger aside this is pretty much just a dumb, gross-out fest for
drunken college kids to hoot an holler to, like The Toxic Avenger was a
generation ago. In other words: I&#x27;m too old for this sh**.
