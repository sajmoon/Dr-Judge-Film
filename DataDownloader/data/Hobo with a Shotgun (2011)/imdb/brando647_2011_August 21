I have never been so overwhelmed with confusion as I was when I first
watched the grindhouse gore-fest HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN. It embraces its
ultra-violent campy roots in one of the most bizarre movies I&#x27;ve ever
seen. Aspiring filmmaker Jason Eisener and his team won a competition
in 2007 to have their faux trailer run before certain prints of the
Tarantino/Rodriguez collaboration GRINDHOUSE. It must&#x27;ve attracted all
the right attention because Eisener was given the chance to turn his
trailer into a full-length film. A hobo rides into Hope Town by train
in his continuing effort to find a new life. His dream: saving enough
money for a lawnmower and starting his own lawn care business. His
arrival in Hope Town shifts his priorities as he witnesses evil at
every turn...corruption, murder, drugs, prostitution, etc. The town is
kept in a constant state of fear by the Drake, a psychopath who loves
his theatrics, and his two sons Slick and Ivan. With the police force
under the Drake&#x27;s control, the hobo snaps, grabs himself a shotgun, and
with the help of prostitute Abby, he vows to rid the city of its filth.<br /><br />The movie starts off normal enough, with the hobo hitching a ride in a
boxcar for his arrival into Hope Town with a vintage saturated color
style and retro credits. Within minutes, we witness just how messed up
this town is as the Drake publicly and proudly decapitates his brother.
From there, it only gets worse with scene after scene of obscenely
hilarious violence. There&#x27;s graphic bullet hits and dismemberment
galore as you see how most of the budget must&#x27;ve gone into gore effects
and gallons of blood. And this leads to one of the best parts of the
movie: thanks to it&#x27;s low budget and new filmmakers, the effects in the
film are practical with little to no CG at all. And it looks great.
Eisener and his team have done an awesome job capturing all the classic
aspects of grindhouse: the gritty style, colorful lighting, horrendous
dialogue, abundant topless women, and lots and lots of graphic
violence. This sort of film is what I&#x27;d hoped for when I first heard
Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s MACHETE was getting the full length treatment.<br /><br />The big question with this film: how did it manage to score Rutger
Hauer as the titular hobo? I never would&#x27;ve imagined him taking a role
in an ultra-violent grindhouse flick. Hauer treats the role with
complete seriousness, never sinking to camp. He growls his lines in
anger as he treats his role legitimately, and it helps keep the film
from devolving into total shlock. On the opposite end of that spectrum
are Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, and and Nick Bateman as the Drake and
his sons. These villains are part cartoon, spastic and mentally
unstable. This isn&#x27;t a complaint; the film isn&#x27;t meant to be taken
serious and these three keep it fun as they ham it up for the camera.
The movie needs the goofiness to help offset how disturbing it can
actually be at times. Even though it&#x27;s all in good fun, I was fine with
the brutal violence until a particular scene about halfway through when
Slick and Ivan address a bus full of school children. Doesn&#x27;t matter
how stupid it&#x27;s played off, it&#x27;s still a bit much to see.<br /><br />Finally, I want to make sure I give mention about the film&#x27;s biggest
WTF element: the Plague. As the film enters the third act and you start
to believe they can&#x27;t possibly concoct anything stranger than what
you&#x27;ve already seen, we meet the Plague...a couple of seemingly
supernatural bounty hunters encased in armor who attack a hospital with
an awesome M.O. consisting of a crossbow/noose combination to hang
their victims on the run. Their lair contains photos of their victims
over the years, including Jesus and some sort of dinosaur, and we catch
glimpses of their pet monstrosity as one of them battles it&#x27;s raging
tentacles. Completely out of place, completely out of the blue, and
probably the coolest part of the whole movie.
