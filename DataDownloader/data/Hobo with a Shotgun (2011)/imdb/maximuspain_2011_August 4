This movie is freaking awesome. I loved every minute of it. It&#x27;s
completely over the top, packed with gore and hilarious bad jokes but
yet it&#x27;s deeply ethical. The city depicted in this film is a (slightly)
distorting mirror to our modern society. If you look close enough, you
will see that &#x22;the plague&#x22; is already here, and that it is only a
matter of time before we all go down the toilet like the protagonists
of &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22;. The movie is part of the grindhouse revival
kicked off by Rodriguez and Tarantino, but it reminded me more of
&#x22;Tokyo Gore Police&#x22; than of classic exploitation flicks from the 60s
and 70s. The only thing about this movie which was really 60s/70s style
was the loud colors and the beautiful vintage music. All in all, this
movie deserves the attribute &#x22;EPIC&#x22; and I would recommend it to anyone
who can appreciate a good exploitation flick with a moral subtext -
only if their stomach can take a bit of (I mean LOTS OF) gore, of
course.
