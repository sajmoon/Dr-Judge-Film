The cover of the DVD said this movie was like &#x27;Machete&#x27;. Well, it is
not! It does not even come close. Where &#x27;Machete&#x27; is very cool and has
a lot of laughs. &#x27;Hobo with a shotgun&#x27; misses all that. It has a very
minimal plot, like &#x27;Machete&#x27;. Both movies are about justice and
revenge. In order for that to work, however, you need to feel a strong
sense of injustice toward the main character&#x27;s opponents. In &#x27;Machete&#x27;
you feel that and that is part of what makes that movie work. In
&#x27;Hobo&#x27;, however, I did not care a bit whether the bad guys got what
they deserved or not. They are two dimensional characters that do
violent things just for the sake of doing violent things. They don&#x27;t
hurt people for a particular reason. It is just what they do. Totally
implausible and uninteresting. The acting is very, very bad. It was
very amateuristic. It was just watching violent act after violent act.
It numbed my mind and became very, very bored. Until, that is, people
started pointing guns at babies and burning a bus full of 7 year old
kids with a flame thrower. That sickened me. It is so stupid and
unnecessary. Tarantino and Rodriguez know how to make an
over-the-top-violent movie that is still entertaining. This movie is
not like that at all.
