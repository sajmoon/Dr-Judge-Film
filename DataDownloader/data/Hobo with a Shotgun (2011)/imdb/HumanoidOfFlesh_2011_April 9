everywhere.The city is overrun with prostitutes,drug dealers,murderers
and paedophiles.Hobo befriends a young hooker named Abby and quickly
after he is chased by The Drake and his two psychotic sons.When he gets
shotgun all hell breaks loose.Insanely bloody and fun to watch &#x22;Hobo
with a Shotgun&#x22; is an explosive blast due to sincere performance of
Rutger Hauer.The film is loaded with extreme gore and corny violence,so

Rambo&#x22;,&#x22;The Expendables&#x22;,&#x22;Machete&#x22; or countless 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s
grindhouse flicks you will enjoy this bloody show.9 hobos with a
shotgun out of 10.
