What better tagline for a movie than: A homeless vigilante blows away
crooked cops, pedophile Santas, and other scumbags with his trusty
pump-action shotgun. I couldn&#x27;t wait to see an action packed,
politically incorrect gory but comic cult-film to be. What a
disappointment that turned out to be. <br /><br />Every movie that sets out an alternative reality should still contain
logical coherency. And in a town where violence is so rampant as in
Hobo, people would simply walk away. But there it is, and one Hobo with
a shotgun is going to change it. Yeah right. Fill it up with cardboard
characters, over the top violence and some &#x27;cool&#x27; lines, and you
created a classic for the gore fans. But it simply doesn&#x27;t work that
way.<br /><br />No, if you are into this kind of movies, your time is better spend on
films like The Toxic Avenger, Sin City, Crank, or Death Wish, to name a
few.
