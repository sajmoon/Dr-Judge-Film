If you are into homemade exploitation torture porn then this is your
pick - otherwise walk away. Only really good thing about this was
Rutger Hauer and some inventive killing scenes. Quality of film brought
in mind early 90&#x27;s low budget films shot in video. Acting and dramatic
style owns much to classic splatter films like Peter Jackson&#x27;s Bad
Taste. What Bad taste did with style - Hobo with a shotgun only tries. <br /><br />Magic is broken with the dumb dialogue and violence that goes a little
bit far. Violence in Bad Taste is visual and funny - so that the actual
event feels less grim. It&#x27;s a fine line between terrifying and
imaginative.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer could have had a great role in this, but the director or
the script gave him only one hooky monologue where he could show his
talent of delivering inspiring speeches. Such a waste of talent. :(
