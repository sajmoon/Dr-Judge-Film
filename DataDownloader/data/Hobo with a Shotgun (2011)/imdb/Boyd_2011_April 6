I could see what the director thought he was doing... Its just that he
has the intelligence of an immature 15 year old and it really shows ...
RH is great as the Hobo ... I hope he doesn&#x27;t feel too upset having to
work on this ... It probably sounded like a possible winner on paper
... But the director is just a simpleton and there is no depth here at
all ... We used to laugh at the old grindhouse crappy movies you
dullard ... But sitting through this all you can laugh at is how people
put up money for this simpleton to make this load of rubbish ... Mind
you then you think about Hollywood and all that crap and its not
surprising The fact is America is nearly incapable of making decent
films anymore ... Now anything decent that comes out of there is a
shock Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t
