Hobo with a Shotgun is directed by Jason Eisener and written by John
Davies. It stars Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Molly
Dunsworth, Robb Wells and Nick Bateman. Music is by Alexander
Rosborough and cinematography by Karim Hussain.<br /><br />A homeless hobo (Hauer) hitches a freight train lift into Hope Town and
finds a city imploding with corruption, violence, drugs and sexual
deviance. Initially trying to keep out of the way and get on with his
meagre existence, the hobo finally cracks and decides he can no longer
sit back and watch such lawlessness. Helping himself to a shotgun from
the local pawn shop, hobo goes on a one man killing crusade.<br /><br />Born out of a trailer that accompanied the original full release of
Rodriguez/Tarrantino&#x27;s Grindhouse venture, Hobo with a Shotgun is
horror exploitation made with abundant glee. Blending Death Wish like
vigilantism with 70s and 80s styled schlock, Jason Eisener has crafted
an utterly tasteless, yet wonderfully entertaining, piece of cinema.
Violence is broad and completely bloody, as heads are exploded, bodies
punctured and characters slotted in a series of increasingly strange
ways, while the characters that inhabit Hope Town are downright nasty
and equally as weird. From bully boy Tom Cruise homage brother bastards
Ivan &#x26; Slick, to a paedophile Santa Claus, and on to The Plague-two
metal suited fetish killers sent to take out the hobo-it&#x27;s bizarreville
for sure.<br /><br />It&#x27;s all driven by a great turn from Hauer, who manages to play it with
raw and subtle emotion, even as the rage takes control of him and he
deals death as surely as he delivers a memorable line. Around him are a
bunch of no mark actors, but this works in the films favour, the
material doesn&#x27;t need star wattage to drive its motor, besides which,
you will undoubtedly come out of the film remembering the characters
these actors have played. Shot in suitably lurid Technicolor by Hussain
and featuring an on the money score by Rosborough, all the elements for
a Grindhouse feature fall into place. It basically does what the title
suggests it will, yes it may at times veer towards crassness, and what
social comment depth intended gets lost as Eisener gets carried away
with the carnage, but this is a whole bunch of fun for adults who
remember the past movies this homages and parodies with aplomb. 8/10
