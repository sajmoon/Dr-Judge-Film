This is an amazing movie.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a melt pot of a lot of Dario Argento&#x27;s movies combined with
Tarentino.<br /><br />It has got the closest you can get to Goblin (Dario Argento&#x27;s movies)
music.With the same colors saturated all over. The atmosphere is
between Tarentino and Dario, with the color of Dario and the
confronting scenes of Tarentino.<br /><br />It tries to be cult, which it is for sure. But it can only become cult
after some period of time. Still I think it will be cult too in the
future.<br /><br />If you like horror from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.... watch it.
