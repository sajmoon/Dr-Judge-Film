First, a word of warning for those intent on seeing this film: this
movie may be far from what you expect.<br /><br />Do you like violence? Lots of blood? Gallons of gore? Horrendous,
unreasonable acts of atrociousness inflicted on innocent civilians?
Well, prepare for Hobo with a Shotgun! <br /><br />I watched Hobo with a Shotgun with my friends expecting a humorous,
Machete-style shoot-&#x27;em-up pastiche. Not unreasonable, considering both
these movies were originally fake trailers for 2007&#x27;s Grindhouse. What
I got was the most sickening, cruel, depressing, wretched and violent
movie I have ever seen. In terms of gore, this movie is right up there
with Peter Jackson&#x27;s classic splatter-fest Braindead (Dead/Alive in the
US).<br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun (further referred to as HWAS) tells the story of an
unnamed homeless man (played by Rutger Hauer) who arrives at a decrepit
city hoping to start a lawn mowing business. Too bad the city is ruled
by a psychopathic crime boss and his two sons who keep the population
under control by striking fear into them through hideous acts of
violence in front of crowds in broad daylight. After a violent run-in
with the criminals and seeing how in ruins the city is the hobo takes
up a shotgun and starts a rampage of violent justice, delivered &#x22;one
shell at a time&#x22;.<br /><br />My main problem with the movie is that it simply goes too far. We see
school kids getting roasted in a bus. We see a helpless woman screaming
in agony and for help as she is being decapitated with a saw. We see
hospital staff getting slashed and hung for no other reason than being
in the wrong place at the wrong time. All these could be enjoyable
scenarios if executed right, but almost every time the context and
setup of the situations is such that we feel bad for the victims and
are afraid of those doing all the violence. This is where the film
falls apart. The depiction of the city and its people is depressing,
even horrifying rather than cartoonishly humorous. The violence goes to
such unprecedented levels that it is simply not entertaining, as it
makes you feel sick. For a movie that doesn&#x27;t have much else going for
it this is far from good.<br /><br />Purely as a film rather than an experience HWAS holds up quite well.
Rutger Hauer gives a stern and solid performance as a man pushed to the
brink, and Molly Dunsworth brings some much-needed warmth to the film
as the female lead who is simply trying to live through another day.
The highly colorful, exaggerated visuals and the sometimes flailing
camera-work give the movie a look of its own. Also I have to respect
the movie for going this far, for even a sickened reaction is better
than no reaction and all. This is HWAS&#x27;s strongpoint: no one can see
this film and merely shrug and say &#x22;Meh&#x22;.
