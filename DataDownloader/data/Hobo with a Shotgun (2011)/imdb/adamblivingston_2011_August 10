This film was the second of the Grindhouse trailers that appeared
between Planet Terror and Tarantino&#x27;s Death Proof that has been made
into a feature film, the first being last year&#x27;s Machete. Well after
seeing Machete, when I heard Hobo With a Shotgun was being made, I knew
it would be hilarious and just as fun as it&#x27;s counterpart.<br /><br />This movie is beyond funny. The one liners that come out of the Drake
family&#x27;s mouths are genius, whether they&#x27;re killing somebody or trying
to purchase sex. The Drake family is made up of the films primary
antagonists. They begin to take over neighborhoods made up of lower
class citizens, and of course, hobos. After too many violent events,
the Hobo, played convincingly by Rutger Hauer, takes a shotgun and goes
on a nasty revenge trip against the rich.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer&#x27;s performance was surprisingly good. It wasn&#x27;t even much
as a performance, more of an embodiment. Easily the best hobo American
cinema has ever seen. <br /><br />I can&#x27;t help but relate this film to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s urban
masterpiece, Taxi Driver. There are a lot of similarities. 1. Main
characters of both films see scum on the streets and want to violently
lash out. 2. Main characters of both films befriend prostitutes.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give too much out, so you&#x27;ll have to check this one out
yourself. It runs at 86 minutes, and it flies by. Take some time off
and have some fun with Hobo With A Shotgun, a great homage to 1970&#x27;s
violent exploitation films.
