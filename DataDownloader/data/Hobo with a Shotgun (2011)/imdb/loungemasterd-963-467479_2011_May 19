There is no dancing around it, this movie blows.<br /><br />I went in thinking this would be a send-up of the fantastic
Exploitation/Grindhouse/midnight movies of the early 70s, and I was
wrong.<br /><br />Imagine a group of frat buddies sitting around hammered and coming up
with a turn f phrase about hobos that is mildly amusing, and then
getting their phones out and filming a movie based on said phrase. A
&#x22;headline&#x22; printed on a newspaper telegraphs this.<br /><br />The acting is terrible. And by that, I don&#x27;t mean, it is terrible and
enjoyable (like Battlefield Earth, I mean it is inept to the point of
being unwatchable. river&#x27;s Ed movies have better exposition and dialog,
and less pornographic gore.<br /><br />This movie isn&#x27;t funny, isn&#x27;t spoofing anything, and yet doesn&#x27;t take
itself seriously enough to be so bad its good. <br /><br />The attempts at gore in this movie are horrific, and not because they
are so over-the-top or extreme; rather, because whomever was behind
this movie doesn&#x27;t understand how to do it. I cringed while watching
this, and I had a blast seeing GG Allin LIVE in SF just before he OD&#x27;d
and I celebrate John Waters. <br /><br />I understand that this won&#x27;t dissuade anyone who has to see every bad
movie ever made (I am on that quest) but for casual bad movie fans save
the two hours of your life and don&#x27;t watch this. &#x22;Death Bed - The Bed
That Eats&#x22; is more entertaining than this dreck. &#x22;Grease 2&#x22; is more
entertaining than this. Any Roger Corman or SyFy/Asylum release is
better than this.<br /><br />Since I have actually seen this movie, I can only imagine that the
positive reviews are written by the filmmakers themselves, friends of
theirs, or people who have seen exactly two movies in their lives--&#x22;The
Room&#x22; and this.<br /><br />And &#x22;The Room&#x22; is a better movie than this is. <br /><br />I give it three stars because you can actually hear the dialogue and I
love Rutger Hauer (watch &#x22;Fatherland&#x22;!).
