Hobo with a Shotgun is a great piece of neo-exploitation, drawn from a
fake trailer in the film Grindhouse. It features an epic performance by
Rutger Hauer, a great flamboyant villain, an outrageous script, and a
director who has the sense not to take any of this seriously. It
follows the exploits of a hobo, played by Hauer, who purchases a pawn
shop shotgun and demands change, one shell at a time.<br /><br />Hobo is essentially a parody of 1970s drive-in exploitation movies,
with a great balance of action and silliness. It takes an already
outsize genre and sends it into the stratosphere, with over the top
villains ranging from pedophilic Santas to The Plague, an ancient
mercenary force with victims including Jesus!<br /><br />The performances take this film to the level of a cult masterpiece.
Hauer is excellent as the Hobo, particularly in the scene where he
gives a speech to a maternity ward full of infants, making them cry by
sheer force of his grizzledness. Brian Downey is even better as Drake,
the crime lord who dominates the city even as it falls to pieces from
his scenery chewing. Molly Dunsworth is also good as the Hobo&#x27;s
sidekick, a streetwalker.
