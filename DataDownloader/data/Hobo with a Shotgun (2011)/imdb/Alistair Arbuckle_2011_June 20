I love horror movies and I love indie flicks. This movie was
laugh-out-loud funny and it kicked my ass. Bravo! The best thing about
this movie was Rutger Hauer and a close second was the song Run With Us
at the end credits. Also, this movie is smarter than people give it
credit for. This is a story of man who rises up against a corrupt
government and he doesn&#x27;t want to hurt anybody. He just has no choice.
All &#x27;The Hobo&#x27; wanted to do was start up his lawn-mowing business, but
he wasn&#x27;t going to just stand by and let this city tear itself apart.
So he decided it was time to deliver justice, one shell at a time! And
it was one shell of a movie too!
