A word of basic advice to all future action-geeks i.e. Tarantino
wannabes who wish to make tribute films to trashploitation cinema: in
order to get the viewer&#x27;s undivided attention you need to first
establish real characters in a real setting &#x96; or at least make a
semblance of an effort to do so. Only once you have created a world
that is half-way real can you proceed with the plot and actually expect
viewers to care about what happens. <br /><br />What you don&#x27;t want to do, as was done with HWASG, is to completely
lose your viewer&#x27;s interest by destroying every little ounce of
credibility and realism right from the get-go. As a result, there isn&#x27;t
a second of tension, excitement or thrills to be found here, for the
simple reason that HWASG has approximately ZERO to do with either
planet Earth or humans, in any way, shape or form. Imagine a primary
school-play version of &#x22;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#x22;. That&#x27;s how tense
this is.<br /><br />But then again, I keep forgetting that this dull piece of crap was made
solely for imbeciles. And judging from the IMDb average, there are
enough of those to go round for several dozen talentless directors to
make a living out of, so who am I to say this movie is a waste of time
and space?<br /><br />HWASG has the cheerful cretinism of a John Waters bomb, the
brain-deadness and pseudo-hipness of a Rob Zombie turkey, and the
self-indulgent anti-intelligence of a Quentin Tarantino production. It
is an indescribably bad crap-for-the-sake-of-it filmic fart, desperate
for attention and B-movie &#x22;glory&#x22;. Its &#x22;humour&#x22; &#x96; pitifully unfunny
3rd-grader level - is based on shock value only, but I truly don&#x27;t see
what there is to shock anyone here. After all, it&#x27;s the year 2011, not
1963, when this movie would have been truly unique and perhaps
effective (though still just as dumb). We&#x27;ve seen it all before, the
gore and the violence and the ultra-cheap gags, and we&#x27;ve seen it in
movies based on actual scripts, with real characters, and dialogue that
doesn&#x27;t sound like it was flatly rejected by Marvel Comics.<br /><br />From &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; to this. Rutger Hauer must be desperate for money.
Dunno, perhaps he really does collect lawnmowers, like the hobo he
plays here. Perhaps that&#x27;s the only aspect of HWASG that has any
connection with the real world. Perhaps he&#x27;d been spending millions on
them but needs more. Whatever his reasons, he must have felt awfully
stupid actually trying to act and keep a straight face in a movie
surrounded by wide-eyed raring-to-go overact-my-socks-off rank
amateurs, not to mention having had to read this &#x22;script&#x22; over and
over, having to actually memorize these abysmal lines. Planting these
lines in one&#x27;s head cannot possibly end well for anyone&#x27;s mental
health.<br /><br />Naturally, I don&#x27;t doubt for a second that I am playing into the
director&#x27;s hands by adding yet another one-star rating. His only goal
in life is to be an infamous director of garbage, he takes pride in
that, hence the need for as many negative reviews as possible because
that too is part of &#x22;creating the legend&#x22;. Though something tells me he
will have limited success in his pitiful undertaking: after all, as I
said earlier, this is 2011, not 1935. Fans of &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; movies are
well-known for their short attention-spans. They will soon move on to
worship the next bloody mess of a movie - or discover the latest
computer game with even more torn limbs speeding through the air - and
totally forget this little desperate-for-attention fiasco.<br /><br />HWASG is the dullest movie I&#x27;ve seen in years, hence one of the worst.
I&#x27;ve completely lost interest in this empty-headed drivel just 20
minutes into it, and am now writing this comment while the rest of the
movie jabbers away in the background. <br /><br />Just a sec, I need to take a look at the screen again, perhaps it&#x27;s
over. What&#x27;s happening right now?... A skinny bad actor with
sun-glasses is dying in a school-bus. There&#x27;s still half an hour left.
Should I stick it out? Nah. I think I&#x27;ll press the &#x22;stop&#x22; button, and
then post this comment on the site whose zombie users gave it a 6.3
average. <br /><br />Luckily for the producers, many viewers simply don&#x27;t know the
difference between &#x22;cheesy&#x22; and &#x22;just plain awful&#x22;.
