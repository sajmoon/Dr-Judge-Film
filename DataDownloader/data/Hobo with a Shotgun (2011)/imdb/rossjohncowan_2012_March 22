This film does exactly what it says on the tin. I had very little
expectation and was entertained throughout. Everything is loud and in
your face, every emotion revved up to cheddar level which i found
thoroughly entertaining and kept me smiling tongue in cheek every
minute.<br /><br />The film doesn&#x27;t take itself seriously so anyone who does when watching
will be disgusted. Again going back to the title no-one should expect
more than what is delivered, a homeless man cleaning up the streets
with a shotgun. Everything is overkill, the bad guys are very bad shown
through several gory incidents which they choose to do infront of
crowds like some sort of sadistic game show of course showing no
remorse but plenty of shameless pleasure.<br /><br />The acting i have seen criticised but again i personally felt
entertained throughout the film and thought the vibe of light hearted
tongue in cheek violence was executed perfectly with all the actors
contributing. Any award worthy serious acting would just be ridiculous
in this picture as this film is not to be taken seriously. Switch off
brain turn on Hobo and enjoy
