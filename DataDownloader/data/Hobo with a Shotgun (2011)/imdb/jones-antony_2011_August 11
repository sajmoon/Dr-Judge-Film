How can this abomination possibly garner a 6.4 rating? I actually enjoy
B-movies (my friends cannot understand my penchant for Troma films) but
this crap even goes beyond anything you will see on the horror channel.
It&#x27;s impossible to even be analytical when reviewing this shite.
Honestly, it&#x27;s so crap that I&#x27;m having a hard time even deciding where
to start when criticising this &#x27;film&#x27;..but I&#x27;ll give it a shot. There
is effectively no plot. The acting could have been bettered by trained
chimps. The camera-work is appalling. The special effects involve men
off camera throwing strawberry jam at each other... Need I go on? I
have spent years watching the trashiest movies that late night TV has
to offer but this goes beyond the pale. Things that would be more
enjoyable than watching this film might include; being stabbed,
contracting AIDS or drowning. It really is that bad!
