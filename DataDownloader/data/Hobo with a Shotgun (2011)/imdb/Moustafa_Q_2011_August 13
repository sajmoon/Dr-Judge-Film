A gorgeous movie about memory and hope. A trip and a form of catharsis.
It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, about
a marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is a
mirror. The same crisis is the &#x22;gift&#x22; of everybody. The same silence,
fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American or
Irakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past like
only reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye.
It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books,
some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of our
hours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smile
are the trees of their presence. Rutger Howard is the image of a age.
Our age who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only
way to be yourself. The way to this urban landscape , the relation with
Abby , the empty attitude, the projection in urban chaos, the words are
the symbols of a clock who is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only
reality of our life.
