Just by the title, I could always tell that Hobo with a Shotgun was
going to be a fun bloody action movie, and I was completely right. Hobo
is a tribute to the old exploitation movies of the 70&#x27;s, based on a
fake trailer from the Grindhouse double feature. Another film based on
a fake trailer from that was last year&#x27;s Machete. But Hobo is so much
better. The movie is insanely graphic, so much that it begins to be a
source of comedy. I can&#x27;t see this film getting anything but NC-17 if
it does get submitted for a rating.<br /><br />The movie begins with a happy, overly bright view of the hobo getting
off of a train and entering an unnamed city, looking for a new life.
Immediately after, however, the city turns out to be full of crime and
violence. The hobo soon buys a shotgun and goes out, cleaning the
streets of drug dealers, pimps, and pedophile Santas. The major crime
boss of the city doesn&#x27;t like this, and fearing for his reputation, he
wages war on the hobo and his &#x22;sidekick&#x22; Abby.<br /><br />This was definitely one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. This
film&#x27;s ability to throw in a hilarious line in the middle of a heavily
intense scene amazes me. There was not a single member of the cast who
wasn&#x27;t insanely good. Two of the best performances came from Gregory
Smith and Nick Bateman as Slick and Ivan, the hilarious and scary sons
of the major crime boss. But Rutger Hauer completely steals the show as
the nameless hobo. If this film was more popular, I would say Hauer
would be up for a Best Actor nomination. His lines are always either
comedic or sad. Another thing I loved about this film was how in some
moments of extreme violence, the camera will tend to linger on small,
innocent things, making the violence very tragic. And the ending, it is
amazing and you will never see it coming. One of the most powerful
endings of a film I have seen in a while.<br /><br />Hobo probably won&#x27;t be playing at a theater near you unless you live in
California or New York City, but it is currently available on iTunes
for an exclusive rental. I strongly suggest renting it, it is worth the
$10 you would spend.
