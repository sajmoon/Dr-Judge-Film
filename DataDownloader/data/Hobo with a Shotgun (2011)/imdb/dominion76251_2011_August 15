Just when you thought that grindhouse/exploitation was a dead genre,
think again! Tarantino has paid homage to it with flicks like Planet
Terror and Deathproof, but they lack the true feel of the originals;
they tend to come off a bit hokey (almost like they are making fun of
the originals). Hobo, however, nails is dead on! <br /><br />Welcome to Scumtown! The only thing worse than the tyrants that run it
is the citizen&#x27;s lost sense of hope. The filth is everywhere. The cops
have been bought. What can turn the tide? Surely not one hobo. But this
hobo is different&#x85; he has a shotgun!! And he is going to dispense
justice; one shell at a time! <br /><br />Rutger Hauer shines as the hobo. All he wanted to do was buy a
lawnmower and start a new business. Instead he invests in a pump 12
gauge to great effect. Molly Dunsworth was adorable as the wayward
prostitute/damsel is distress. All the essential exploitation elements
are here: extreme gore, violence, nudity, profanity&#x85; all the things
that make for a great family movie night (kidding). The scene where the
chick gleefully baths in the blood spray from a decapitated body has to
be seen to be believed. The tone is absolutely awesome; if you didn&#x27;t
know better, you would think that this is something Troma made in 1984.
The pace is unrelenting; you will not be bored for one second. By the
end you will be jumping out of your seat and cheering &#x22;Shoot him
again!&#x22; The special effects were spot on- no hokey CGI blood sprays
here. These guys kicked it old school and made a true masterpiece. That
is something that is simply lost on the movie makers of today. (If I
have to watch one more SCI FI channel horror movie with a crappy CGI
flying monster, I&#x27;m gonna puke.) I gave Hobo a 9 out of 10 simply
because I thought the ending could have been better , but it was still
excellent overall.<br /><br />I honestly thought that movies like this would never be made again.
Boy, am I glad I was wrong. Bravo gents, bravo.
