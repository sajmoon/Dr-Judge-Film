This film actually exceeded my expectations as it captured the essence
of exploitation films in every way, such as the Technicolor. The
grittiness, the violence, and some of the dialogue all fit in this film
very well. Since this type of film is not to be taken seriously, it&#x27;s
hard to actually pinpoint some of it&#x27;s problems. There was some over
the top silliness in the film (look at the board to see why) that made
me shake my head a little. Kind of a &#x27;what&#x27;s the point of this&#x27;? Other
than that, this film is perfect for people who don&#x27;t take movies
seriously, which is more than I can say for some people on this board
complaining that this movie shouldn&#x27;t be bad for bad sakes. What else
would you expect from a movie called &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22;? The
filmmakers of this movie in my opinion have created their own genre,
kind of like Metallica did with Thrash Metal (Thrashploitation,
maybe?). Hopefully we can see a trend going on with this genre because
with constant CGI and Hollywood formula, it&#x27;s nice to see a movie that
is really &#x22;different&#x22;.<br /><br />I thought the crew could have made this movie a bit better, but it&#x27;s
their first feature. I hope the filmmakers go on the comment section of
this movie and read what they could do to improve their filmmaking, as
they should progress their talents further. I have no clue how they are
going to do the same without Rutger Hauer or the Grindhouse backing,
but I am looking forward to seeing their next film.
