This movie is shot to resemble some B 70s movie filled with lots of
violence. It&#x27;s similar to Tarrentino/Rodrigous collaborations, except
this one is no where near as good. The story is not good. It&#x27;s about a
hobo that gets a shotgun and goes out for revenge. He kills those that
humiliate the homeless and specifically goes after 2 brothers and their
dad, whom love violence and killing people in sadistic ways. When they
burn a school bus full of children and laugh about it, that was just
disturbing. No one wants to see that.<br /><br />The hobo teems up with a prostitute and they talk about bears and
leaving town, but soon she&#x27;s got the shotgun also. Just silly.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Don&#x27;t give yourself nightmares, skip it.
