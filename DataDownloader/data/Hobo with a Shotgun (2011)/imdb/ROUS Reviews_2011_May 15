Reviews Of Unusual Size!<br /><br />Re: An idealistic hobo arrives in a town ruled by some guy that should
have had an Irish accent judging by his dialogue. He and his sons rule
the town with sadistic violence and drugs. The hobo hoped to buy a
lawnmower. He ends up with a shotgun instead.<br /><br />Outstanding: An homage to 70&#x27;s grindhouse splatter, HWAS revels in
gallons of bright red blood and over the top violence. Rutger Hauer is
immensely watchable the entire film and the music is spot on.<br /><br />Unacceptable: Everyone else, however operates at a high school drama
club level of overacting and the director makes a shambling mess of
black lights and dodgy effects.<br /><br />Summary: I wanted to love this movie, and at times I was overjoyed, but
most of the time, I was bored out of my mind with the nonsensical
attempts to one up the previous scene in the violence department. Hauer
is great, there&#x27;s a few good lines, inexplicable giant tentacles and a
sadly underused Sawed-Off Shotgun/Axe, but that can&#x27;t save this mess of
a film. <br /><br />2/5
