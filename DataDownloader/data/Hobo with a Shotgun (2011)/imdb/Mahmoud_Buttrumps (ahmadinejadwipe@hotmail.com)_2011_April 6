It is beyond my imagination how anyone with the slightest idea what a
good movie is can enjoy this.<br /><br />Rutger returns to the Canadian branch of Hollywood to rescue his long
lost wife and son. If you want to see nonstop action (extremely bad
action that is) then you might enjoy this actioneer movie. Scene after
scene, Rutger continues to kill, kill, kill, and not in a good way like
in the Rambo movies, or other good action movies like Die Hard.<br /><br />I also got to point out Rutger&#x27;s acting, he doesn&#x27;t even shed a tear!
Totally zombie. The actors were retarded, people you would see acting
in a childs movie. It even lacked the laughs this piece of garbage
could have provided.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs! 1/10
