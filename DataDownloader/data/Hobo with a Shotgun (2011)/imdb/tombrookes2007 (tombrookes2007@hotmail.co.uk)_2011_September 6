This 1980&#x27;s styled horror genre cult attempt is a mighty fine effort
and a great film for 2011. Yes HWAS is a silly, sick, gore-fest
vigilante romp, but what it does it does excellently for fans of this
type of horror. Some of Hobo is Tarantino-esque and thus a worthy
watch.<br /><br />Rutger Haur is brilliant as a tired, angry and infuriated hobo tramp.
In the chaotic city of Hope Land, Hobo Haur has had enough, saving then
befriending a young prostitute, amidst riotous robbers and thugs. All
he wanted to do was save up for a lawnmower to go legit, but a robbery
brings him into a violent rampage to clean up the streets. The city is
being run by coke fiend villains The Duke and his moronic teen sons.
This battle thus concludes a great tongue in cheek horror film, with a
retro fun feel, in the manner it all begins.
