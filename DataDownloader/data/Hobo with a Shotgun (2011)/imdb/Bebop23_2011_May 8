Lame. Totally lame. You could have made a movie where a couple of guys
pulled boxes out of bigger boxes for two hours and it would&#x27;ve been
better than this. Rutger Hauer is alright as the Hobo, I&#x27;ll give him
that, but really everything about this movie is wrong - a terrible
script acted out badly, and the over-the-top death scenes that are
meant to be selling this movie were done with more imagination and
skill 30 years ago.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re looking to see this movie for a bit of a laugh or because
you&#x27;re into gore-fests then do it, but you&#x27;ll still be disappointed.
The only way I&#x27;d recommend this film to anyone is if they were on the
run from mafia hit men and they ran into a cinema for cover and didn&#x27;t
care which theater they ended up in.<br /><br />It woulda been alright if it had been funny.
