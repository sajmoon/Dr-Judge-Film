Remember the days when grindhouse was king? Well, I don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m only
30 so my earliest memories of horror are from the 80&#x27;s. However, thanks
to Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and to an extent Eli Roth the
grindhouse genre is coming back to us in full force. With the release
of the double feature &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; in 2007 audiences were given a
chance to experience the style of film-making that made movie going in
the 70&#x27;s such a rush. These grainy, low brow, violent exploitation
films are the type of love it or hate it fare that we haven&#x27;t seen in a
long time. &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; was a double feature (&#x22;Planet Terror&#x22; and
&#x22;Death Proof&#x22;) which included faux film trailers during the break
between the feature films. Two of those fake trailers have now become
full feature films, &#x22;Machete&#x22; and &#x22;Hobo With A Shotgun&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;Hobo With A Shotgun&#x22; starring Rutger Hauer and directed by Jason
Eisener is the latest entry to the &#x22;new grindhouse&#x22; category of films.
Backpacking off of the mildly successful &#x22;Machete&#x22;, director Jason
Eisener pulled off a whirlwind of gore, excellent one liners and brutal
action. Rutger Hauer was excellent as the Hobo with a heart of gold,
quick wit and balls of steel. Hobo, since the character is nameless in
the film, arrives via train to this desolate town looking for a fresh
start. He wanders the city contemplating his next move when he
witnesses a few thugs murder a man in the middle of the street during
the day. Confused about the lawlessness he eventually fights back
against one of the villains and takes him to jail, however, the
response from the police is not what he expected. Eventually, Hobo
decides to take the law into his own hands, along with a Shotgun.<br /><br />&#x22;Hobo With A Shotgun&#x22; doesn&#x27;t pretend to be anything it is not and that
is what is so appealing to people. We know that this type of movie is
meant to entertain, not frighten. This isn&#x27;t a John Carpenter or Wes
Craven type film. The mix of violent, over the top situations along
with an intensely satisfying soundtrack and corny jokes are just what
horror fans need right now. Finally, an original script on a classic
genre has made movie going interesting again. &#x22;Hobo&#x22; is certainly a
welcome change from the &#x22;torture&#x22; genre that has been so prevalent
recently. This isn&#x27;t some re-hash of a classic horror or stolen from
across the pond, this is pure exploitation entertainment that a new
generation will get to experience. I&#x27;m excited that this trend is
coming back. Maybe we will get to see some new blaxploitation films
soon since the grindhouse and blaxploitation films were often billed
together in the 70&#x27;s.
