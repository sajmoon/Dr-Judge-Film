I only ended up watching this movie because the husband of a friend I
was visiting selected this. I just don&#x27;t understand all the positive
reviews. Am I missing something? Is there something wrong with me
because I can&#x27;t appreciate disturbing gratuitous violence? I watched
the first half hour of this movie and had to walk away. The level of
gore, violence, and sadism was so disturbing. How can doing horrible
unspeakable acts to other humans be considered art? What is the point
of this movie? If you enjoy non-ending pointless violence, blood, and
gore, I guess you won&#x27;t be disappointed.<br /><br />I found this movie so disturbing that I couldn&#x27;t shake the images from
my head for several days afterwards. I appreciate movies that are
disturbing in their social commentary and make me think, but in what
world does the setting of this movie even exist?! I may get slammed by
those who loved the movie for being old-fashion and prudish but this
movie goes way beyond any acceptable level of violence. It&#x27;s disturbing
that this movie gets any positive reviews.
