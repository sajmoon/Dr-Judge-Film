I should probably start off by pointing out that if you&#x27;re one of those
who considers a movie like Taxi Driver to be &#x22;violent&#x22;, &#x22;gruesome&#x22;, or
&#x22;out of hand&#x22; in any way, you may want to skip Hobo With A Shotgun. In
fact, you may want to forget you ever heard of this ferocious new
school masterpiece. But for the rest of you. Those whose appreciate
Exploitation from decades past, will no doubt fall in love.<br /><br />So, Rutget Hauer plays a hobo/drifter, who&#x27;s unknowingly hitched a ride
on a train straight to Hell. Or at least a similar place. I&#x27;d imagine
Hell having more rules. This awful town is run by a bloodthirsty
killer/crime boss, who basically owns the police department to the
point that this man can just take anyone out in the street and brutally
murder them, in front of anyone, and no consequences! This town is full
of hookers, junkies, killers, and just about any kind of lowlife you
could think of. meanwhile Rutger is getting pretty steamed, just
sitting there, observing this awful place, while begging for change. He
was going to use the money to buy a lawn mower, but perhaps a shotgun
would be more useful, considering the man is just seconds away from
snapping. And let me tell ya, when some people snap, they really really
snap. It ain&#x27;t gonna be purdy! In My opinion, this movie is as good as
it gets! Hobo With A Shotgun is some beautiful, modern exploitation.
Which is rare, these days. I can&#x27;t think of anything I didn&#x27;t love
about this one. I can usually rewatch a lot of my favorites, over &#x26;
over again. But sometimes, I come across one that I feel should only be
saved for the rarest of occasions. Hobo With A Shotgun is most
definitely one of them. Undisputed proof that Exploitation is alive and
well. What a tasteless gorefest! What a masterpiece! 10/10
