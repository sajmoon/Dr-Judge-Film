&#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; is a fairly impressive debut film considering it
sprang from a two-minute &#x22;fake trailer,&#x22; but there are a number of
issues which may keep it from reaching true &#x22;cult&#x22; status (for which it
was clearly intended)...and a number of notes it hits perfectly.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer is a perfect fit for his role and as charismatic as
always; anyone into schlocky cult films will feel right at home seeing
him play the title character. This film also wins on atmosphere--I
really felt as if I was watching something straight out of the 80s. The
music is right, the vaguely post-apocalyptic feel is right, the
lighting and production design are also just right. There are some
great gore scenes here and some wonderfully indulgent bloody action
sequences (if somewhat small-scale). It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that some of
the most gruesome moments are treated with a devilish sense of humor.<br /><br />What hampers &#x22;Hobo&#x22; is its narrative--confused editing and confused
scripting result in a jumbled plot, leaving one to wonder if something
was left on the &#x22;cutting room floor.&#x22; The writers seem to have rushed
through their story simply to reach an unsatisfying climax; I felt much
more could have been made of the title character&#x27;s transformation from
&#x22;Hobo&#x22; to &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun.&#x22; This crucial epiphany is cheaply
handled and consequently the mythic persona at the center of the film
feels shallow. <br /><br />(as an aside, it seemed the character should have led some sort of
heroic uprising, which I can&#x27;t really hold against the film as this is
simply what I would have liked to see. My point is, it seems there are
a lot of missed chances here)<br /><br />While the end also feels rushed, abrupt and incomplete, I would have to
say this film is worth checking out...for fans of this kind of thing,
which I certainly am. I was just expecting a little more. In any event,
I&#x27;m glad it was made!<br /><br />(P.S. There&#x27;s a nice use of the Canadian pop song &#x22;Run with Us,&#x22; from
an obscure--obscure in the U.S., anyway--animated show called &#x22;The
Raccoons&#x22; over the end credits. It adds to the 80s atmosphere
beautifully. Bonus points!)
