Catchy title, eh? I&#x27;ve been following the progress of HOBO WITH A
SHOTGUN for about a year now. We all know the story about how
writer-director Jason Eisener won a trailer contest around the time
Tarantino and Rodriquez&#x27;s GRINDHOUSE came out and then how fans
everywhere demanded to see a feature length feature of HOBO. We&#x27;ve been
through all over this before. But I can&#x27;t remember another genre film
that&#x27;s gotten such attention and positive buzz based solely on it&#x27;s
title. I mean come on; who doesn&#x27;t wanna see a hobo, who carries around
a shotgun, clean up a crime-ridden town? And when that hobo just
happens to be Rutger Hauer, all the better. So does HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN
live up to the hype?<br /><br />You can all let out that sigh of relief ... HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN doesn&#x27;t
just live up to all the hype and buzz, it goes way beyond it. This is a
hugely entertaining film that&#x27;s without a doubt my favorite film of
2011 so far. Rutger Hauer puts in a fantastic performance as the hobo
who comes to a new city, a city which makes Tromaville look like
Beverley Hills, to start over. He plans on saving up enough money to
buy a used lawnmower at the local pawn shop and start up a lawn cutting
service. But from the second he gets to town he&#x27;s treated poorly,
beaten up, spit on, and witnesses such out in the open horrors like a
pedophile Santa, a night club that tortures hobos, pimps pimping out
underage girls, and a &#x22;filmmaker&#x22; who pays hobos to fight each other to
the death. The police are all corrupt and are owned by the local crime
boss Drake (Brian Downey) and his two violent sons Slick (Gregory
Smith) and Ivan (Nick Bateman). The people living in the town are in
constant fear and all feel powerless to do anything about the horrible
atrocities going on around them.<br /><br />But Hauer meets someone who puts the faith of humanity back into him.
He meets and saves the life of Abby (Molly Dunsworth), a hooker with a
heart of gold. Hauer&#x27;s Hobo finally snaps when he goes to buy the
lawnmower and the pawn shop is held up by three thugs who&#x27;re going to
kill a mother and her infant baby. He sees a shotgun on the shelf and
the rest is history. He goes on a murderous vigilante spree to clean up
the city and help Abby find a better life for herself.<br /><br />Now just know what you&#x27;re getting into with HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN people.
This isn&#x27;t a serious film that tries to stay within the realm of
reality. This is a grindhouse/exploitation film like the ones that used
to play around the clock on 42nd Street in New York City. HOBO is full
of dark humor and a lot of very disturbing images that will really
shock and make you turn to your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife and
say, &#x22;Did they really just do that?&#x22; Don&#x27;t believe me? Just wait for
the scene with the school bus full of children and the guy with the
flamethrower. Oh yeah; writer-director Eisener goes there. This is an
over-the-top, gonzo film that&#x27;s not afraid to tread into some truly
disturbing territory and definitely not afraid to heap on the gore.
Seriously; there&#x27;s a LOT of gore here to satisfy even the biggest gore
hound.<br /><br />HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN, though, isn&#x27;t just a gimmicky film that relies on
gore and over-the- top set pieces. Eisener proves that he can really
make a great film. The color pallet Eisener and cinematographer Karim
Hussain (himself a brilliant experimental horror filmmaker) use is
stunning. If Dario Argento made a grindhouse film, it&#x27;d be HOBO WITH A
SHOTGUN!! Vibrant yellows, greens, and reds dominate giving every scene
a kind of hyper-reality. Plus we get cool little tricks like accenting
the blueness of Hauer&#x27;s eyes. Whenever we see Hauer, no matter how
filthy he is and no matter what kind of violent action he&#x27;s doing, his
blue eyes are always so prevalent that it reminds you that deep down
inside he&#x27;s a good man trying to do the right thing. He knows he&#x27;s not
gonna get any help from the corrupt police so he&#x27;s cleaning up the town
the only way he can ... with violence.<br /><br />And the gore? Just wait until you see what Eisener puts on film!! He
pushes the envelop in every way and uses only practical effects and
uses them well. We get decapitations, compound fractures, a hobo hung
upside down and beaten with a bat studded with razor blades (&#x22;When life
gives you razor blades you make a baseball bat covered in razor
blades&#x22;), children getting killed, a hand being torn apart by a
lawnmower blade, and tons of shotgun blasts blowing off body parts and
blown away abdomens. And this is just the tip of the iceberg ... or
Eisenerberg (sorry, couldn&#x27;t help myself). Just like in LAID TO REST
there&#x27;s some digital f/x in HOBO but they are only there to supplement
and enhance the practical f/x.<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN. The
story is over-the- top but effective; the acting is strong across the
board; the gore is extremely well done; and Eisener captures the feel
for the old grindhouse flick perfectly (he in fact does a better job
here than both Rodriquez and Tarantino did in GRINDHOUSE). And just
wait until you meet The Plague!! HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is one of those
films that&#x27;s really easy to review. If you get the chance you
definitely wanna see this one on the big screen. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN is
a hugely entertaining film that I can&#x27;t recommend enough.
