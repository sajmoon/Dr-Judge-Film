Rutger Hauer makes a fine return to the screen with this grind-house
flick about a homeless man who finds himself in a world full of sleaze
and unpunished criminal activity. Its only when he himself is pushed
too far that he finally snaps and decides to &#x22;Deliver justice one shell
at a time&#x22;. Personally I loved it, but then I was able to watch it with
the right frame of mind and admire the simplistic nature of this film.
If you can take your brain out and get in the mood for an over-the-top,
ultra violence film then you&#x27;ll have no problem sitting through this
future grind-house classic.<br /><br />However, it amazes me that there are a few people who seem to think
that a film entitled &#x22;Hobo with a shotgun&#x22; was going to be anything
more than it was. I mean read the title back to yourself, look at the
extreme artwork on the DVD cover and tell me you thought it would be
anything other than a low-budget action film with lots of gore, a
ridiculous plot and plenty of over-acting (save for Hauer, who was
excellent). Of course its stupid, but then its supposed to be. The guys
who made this knew what they were making here, and their intention was
to make a homage to the classic 80s B-movies, nothing more.
