I deeply LOVE Rutger Hauer, and I understand the motivation for the
movie, he&#x27;s drawn to it, the story is good, great gore and trash, the
meaning was there but needed more, more truth and exposure of actual
facts and injustices, but the execution is in fact dreadful ! God
story, bad execution for me. Still love Rutger... he did right.<br /><br />I simply hope that won&#x27;t stigmatize he&#x27;s carrier for the future...
because god only knows he can act (Blind Fury, Sin City, Batman Begins,
The Rite... and of course my all times favourite: Blade Runner) Take
Care Rutger...<br /><br />Regards, Xaris
