2011_April 17 
First off, I&#x27;m not squeamish about blood and gore. Not that I&#x27;m really
a fan of horror and grindhouse movies, but every now and then I enjoy a
gory flick along the lines of Saw or Hostel, provided that it has a bit
of a plot.<br /><br />This... movie didn&#x27;t have one. It didn&#x27;t really have anything other
than extreme violence and over-the-top gore. Almost every single scene
was filled with blood, guts, and brain mass, set to a cacophony of
screams of pain and terror mixed with the most obscene language
imaginable.<br /><br />After half an hour, my mind went numb. 45 minutes into the movie, I was
literally sick and tired of the gore, depravity and obscenity. After
one hour, I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and skipped through the
rest of this sickening orgy of violence in fast forward.<br /><br />It was not just the non-stop violence and gore that got to me. It was
the way in which it was mixed with sex and complete moral corruption,
as well as the fact that a lot of the violence was directed against
women and children (and not just the violence). A pedophile Santa
masturbated while watching small children on a schoolyard, armed
robbers threatened to shoot an infant, screaming children were abducted
in broad daylight, and all these disturbing scenes alternated with
hacked or shot off body parts and bloody intestines spilling over the
pavement.<br /><br />It is almost as if the director tried to depict the very worst of
humanity, a previously unimaginable level of moral corruption and
outright evil. But instead of decrying it, this movie celebrates it in
one shocking scene after the other, in unnaturally bright and cheerful
colors, without giving the appalled audience a break. It&#x27;s simply too
much for a halfway sane human mind.<br /><br />Aside from that, the movie has nothing whatsoever to offer. Rutger
Hauer&#x27;s and Molly Dunsworth&#x27;s acting is actually not that bad,
considering the meager dialogs and the bizarre, utterly unbelievable
movie setting that don&#x27;t really give them anything to work with. But
Rutger Hauer fans have come to expect much better performances from
him. I will never understand why he took this role.<br /><br />As for the supposed point or message of this movie that was mentioned
in some other reviews: I haven&#x27;t seen any such thing. The &#x22;hero&#x22; of
this flick is as much of a deranged psychopath as the countless
villains that he butchers without remorse.<br /><br />Yes, there is one short scene where the main character babbles hollow
moral platitudes in the baby ward of a hospital, but it is quickly
followed by mind-numbing gore as two thugs wrapped in grotesque
futuristic battle armor (as I said, the story is utterly bizarre and
unbelievable) slaughter the terrified hospital staff.<br /><br />Even if there was some kind of moral lesson towards the end that I
missed out on, it can&#x27;t make up for the sickening non-stop celebration
of inhuman atrocities that precluded it. Bottom line: Unless you&#x27;re a
hardcore fan of the grindhouse genre, who can never get enough blood
and gore and thinks of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a comedy, you
really don&#x27;t want to do this to yourself.
