Look, I get it. Its a grind house, bad B movie, troma film. Thats why i
wanted to watch it. I love horror movies and the genre itself and give
them a good review relative to the genre. Many times i enjoy goofy
buckets of blood, bad special effects, funny horror film (Evil Dead 2
or Army of Darkness anyone?) <br /><br />However, when its horror and violence are depicted against a child (gun
pointing at a helpless infant, burning children to death with a
flamethrower), it isn&#x27;t funny, cool, artistic, pushing-the-envelop,
campy, cultish, amazing, or silly. Its stupid, morally repulsive, and
WRONG.<br /><br />Keep the blood, violence, and gore on adults, but NEVER against a
child.<br /><br />This is probably the only horror film I&#x27;ve ever turned off and gave up
on without finishing.<br /><br />1 star people. (Id go negative if i could)
