Worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen!!!! It&#x27;s the Depeche Mode gone wild, without
any fond memories, and adding an excess of gore, with such extremely
predictable dialog and scenes I found this movie to be the hardest to
finish watching as I have ever seen, and I never stop a movie i have
started. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like gore and extravagant violence as
much as anyone, and was not turned away by any of that, but at least to
me, the attempt to pull at any attachment to the characters, good or
bad, was so god awfully done i am pretty sure i would be able to
accomplish so much more in my alley with an ancient camcorder. Do not
bother!
