This is the worst movie i&#x27;ve seen in years. I can&#x27;t believe some
reviews i read here - how can even people claim to enjoy this? I&#x27;m sure
a lot of people will want to watch it seeing only its title, thinking
it&#x27;s a movie like Zombieland where a ridiculous plot is executed as a
funny comedy.. I was expecting a comedy too with this title for a movie
(what else could it be??), but in fact to my surprise it isn&#x27;t even
meant to be a comedy.. to be honest I don&#x27;t think this movie was meant
for sane people.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is about &#x22;evil&#x22; people beating up the
&#x22;innocent&#x22; in the most violent and sick ways (the first 40 minutes is
made of this and nothing else.. how is this enjoyable??..); and then
for the movie what you get is:<br /><br />gore terribly executed, cries of victims (it gets annoying after the
first minute), awful image quality (as if watching an 1990 movie),
amateur camera movement, absolutely no plot but a lot of meaningless
blabla, 100% stupidity, poor acting and the worst of all is that it&#x27;s
filled only with sick, distorted &#x26; psycho fetish ideas of how to kill
or humiliate or beat up another being &#x26; in my opinion anyone who enjoys
it has got some serious mental issues to resolve.<br /><br />In conclusion, it saddens me to see that today&#x27;s mentality likes the
concepts that this movie is made of. It&#x27;s totally inhuman and
unnatural, devoid of any real human values. It&#x27;s themes are made
entirely of sick gratuitous violence, humiliation and revenge. If it
was a comedy, I could discard these points, but it&#x27;s not.
