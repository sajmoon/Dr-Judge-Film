Some years ago, directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez made a
contest between amateur filmmakers in order to select a trailer which
would be included as part of the Grindhouse project. The winning
trailer ended up being Hobo with a Shotgun, which was unfortunately
only exhibited in the Canadian version of Grindhouse, even though it&#x27;s
obviously available on the Internet in order to delight the fans of
exploitation cinema with its ridiculous premise and blood images. More
recently, and following the steps of Machete, a film inspired on that
fleeting film joke was made...and I&#x27;m glad to say that Hobo with a
Shotgun didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all, because it intelligently expands
the story and doesn&#x27;t spare even a single drop of blood, nor a pinch of
morbidity in order to make a tribute to the &#x22;grindhouse&#x22; cinema. And
the best thing of all is that it offers wide doses of black humor
without laughing at that kind of cinema, and keeping an absolute
respect for its tragic main character.<br /><br />On some way, Hobo with a Shotgun looks like a Troma Films movie from
the &#x27;80s, because it has an amateur &#x22;taste&#x22; which looks deceptively
real. However, there&#x27;s professional talent in its saturated
cinematography (&#x22;Color by Technicolor&#x22;), good performances and solid
direction, well balanced between dramatic moments and scenes of a
grotesque gore which ignore any notion of &#x22;good taste&#x22; in order to
delight itself in such an extreme cruelty that it borders the black
humor. In other words, there isn&#x27;t any &#x22;tabu&#x22; in Hobo with a Shotgun,
at least regarding the violence; but it&#x27;s so ridiculously over the top
that it looks like a insane caricature which is impossible to take it
seriously. I&#x27;m saying all that as a warning to the spectators who
aren&#x27;t accustomed by the satisfactorily perverse elements of
exploitation cinema. After all, that has always been the purpose of
this kind of cinema, and I have to appreciate Hobo with a Shotgun for
having fulfilled with that.<br /><br />Having said that, it would be unfair to classify Hobo with a Shotgun as
another simple &#x22;straight to DVD&#x22; film which only offers gore (in fact,
this film had a limited release in North American and Canadian cinemas,
but I won&#x27;t get into details). Thanks to Rutger Hauer&#x27;s excellent
performance, Hobo with a Shotgun takes a different dimension, more
sever and realistic, making us feel the pain and disappointment the
main character experiences. On the other side of the coin, I have to
mention that Hobo with a Shotgun has a few fails, which come from some
clich&#xE9;s and forced details from the screenplay.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked Hobo with a Shotgun pretty much, and I can
definitely recommend it...only to the people who know exactly what they
can find in here.
