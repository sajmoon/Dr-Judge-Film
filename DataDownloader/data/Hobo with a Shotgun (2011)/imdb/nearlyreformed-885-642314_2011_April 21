The story of a homeless man who arrives in a new town overran with
crime and batman like super villains. All he wanted was a lawn mower!
He intercepts an armed robbery and suddenly decides to become a
homeless vigilante- a hobo with a shotgun! Terrible acting from
everyone but the legendary Hauer and some insanely over the top blood,
guts and gore make this a fantastically silly but fun film to watch.
Very much a B movie in every way which does not take itself too
seriously. Great fun- but not for the easily offended. Our hero is
never even given a name in true video nasty style. I am a huge fan of
what in the UK we call the video nasty generation and I am delighted
that these films I grew up with are being homaged and remade etc now.
This isn&#x27;t as classy or intelligent as the Rodriguez/Tarantino team up
Grindhouse (Planet Terror and Death Proof) but still in the same vein
and if you enjoyed those you will love this.
