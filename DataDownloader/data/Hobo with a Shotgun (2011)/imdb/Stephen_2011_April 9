First of all, I have to put a disclaimer: My low rating was not because
this movie had no plot, or bad acting. I can see how people give it
high ratings, but it was far too over-the-top for my liking. A bit of
gore here and there is alright, but this movie was a nonstop orgy of
gore thrown at the viewers for shock value.<br /><br />Having said that, I think that this movie had a very good point, and
depicted humanity fairly well, though not to that extreme. As a
metaphor for human existence, I believe it got its point across, and
should be commended for doing so. However, the presentation had much to
be desired.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a movie with a lot of horrendously gross scenes,
tons of gore, some action, and leaves you with a thoughtful, nauseated
feeling, this is the movie for you.
