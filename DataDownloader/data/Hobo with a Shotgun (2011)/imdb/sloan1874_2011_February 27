Poorly executed Paul Verhoeven 80&#x27;s pastiche with little very little to
recommend for it - the film establishes its meagre premise pretty early
on and then just sets about finding out how many ways it can kill and
maim its cardboard-thin characters. I&#x27;m sure there will be those who
argue that fans of this sort of thing will love it and that it is an
intentionally funny homage to the grindhouse genre, but it doesn&#x27;t
excuse such a tedious film. Producing something that is so obviously
lacking in the inventiveness and humour of the films it seeks to ape,
and then claiming &#x27;that&#x27;s what we intended&#x27;, is a poor excuse. As the
old tautological truism goes: a bad film is a bad film. Just shows that
a great film title alone is not enough.
