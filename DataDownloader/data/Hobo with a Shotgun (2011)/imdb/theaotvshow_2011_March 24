This movie is dreadful. It is just as un-sophisticated as the title
suggests. Yes, I do realize someone looking for a deep piece of cinema
wouldn&#x27;t have this movie at the top of their list - but that isn&#x27;t the
point. This film is insulting to the intelligence of an eight year old.<br /><br />Plot holes galore, poor storytelling, horrible direction. The acting
was a passable aspect, and the film did have some decent production
value. Fact of the matter is, from the first Act through to the end of
the film, I was constantly thinking &#x22;Sundance selected this?&#x22; &#x22;This
actually got distribution?&#x22;. <br /><br />Somehow, this grindhouse style picture manages to be pretentious. Do
yourself a favour, save your money. This film makes Transformers 2 look
like a Kubrick masterpiece.
