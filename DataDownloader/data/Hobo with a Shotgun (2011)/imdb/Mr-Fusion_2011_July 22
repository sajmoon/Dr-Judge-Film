Jason Eisener&#x27;s &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; is a study in excess. It&#x27;s an ode
to the style and grittiness of &#x27;70s grindhouse cinema brimming with the
bloodshed, over-the-top violence and bad taste of the Troma films in
their heyday. <br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays, for lack of a character name, The Hobo, a homeless
drifter who wanders into a lawless town that doesn&#x27;t take kindly to the
downtrodden. The city is a cesspool of violence and anarchy. The police
give way to the criminal antics of The Drake, a man who&#x27;s part kingpin,
part homicidal game show host. His two degenerate sons spend their time
loansharking, dealing and setting buses of schoolkids ablaze. With no
one else coming forth to bring law and order to this hellhole, The Hobo
gets his hands on a Remington pump-action and takes to cleaning up the
streets himself.<br /><br />Somewhere beneath the brutally excessive carnage and human
dismemberment is a moral message (though clumsily delivered) on the
killing of innocent people. But this is not a &#x22;message&#x22; film - it&#x27;s all
about the gritty, bloody throwback. And were it not for Hauer, this
film would feature rather poor acting. But Hauer makes the character
interesting, playing the role with a surprisingly warm sincerity and
truly elevating the film in the process. This is not a movie with high
replay value, for me. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever watch it again. But Hauer&#x27;s
presence kept me glued to the very end.<br /><br />5/10
