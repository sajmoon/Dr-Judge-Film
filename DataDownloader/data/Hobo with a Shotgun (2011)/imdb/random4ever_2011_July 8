its not the worst thing i seen, yet, this movie looks like it was
filmed in Canada and has a lot of senseless violence from start to
finish, so after i saw the video i looked it up and found it was made
with a budget of 3 million bucks, i thought its budget was a lot less,
if your into old school 80s blood and gore this might be what your
looking for. i really don&#x27;t know how to say how bad this movie is. you
can film way better stuff with a camcorder or your cell phone camera.
they might of used a old 70s low end camera for some sorta film effect?
i never seen or herd of anyone in the film and i hope i never see them
again, the entire movie blows unless your into bad films then you might
like it. this movie is best to watch when you have nothing else to see
and you have no expectations of any kind from a movie and your bored of
watching infomercials.
