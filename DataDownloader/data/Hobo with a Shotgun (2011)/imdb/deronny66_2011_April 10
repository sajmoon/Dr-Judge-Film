2011_April 10 
There have been a string of &#x27;outrageous&#x27; and silly films lately,
including Planet Terror and Machete. I seem to quite enjoy the genre so
I was looking forward to seeing this film. Sadly, it missed the mark so
badly I thought I&#x27;d had to write this review.<br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun is an extremely violent film. And that&#x27;s about it.
It is really, really violent and at times shockingly sadistic. This
could be fine if the violence was justified with big dollop of humour,
but for the vast majority of the film it&#x27;s not. The best way to
describe this film is if you left a bunch of 14 year olds with a
camcorder to make the most &#x27;shocking&#x27; thing they could. Have you ever
seen that episode of South Park where the children write the book &#x27;The
Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs&#x27;? It&#x27;s just like that.<br /><br />The result is a film that tries so hard to be gory and sick that all
other elements of the film are almost forgotten, most notably the
elements that you probably wanted to watch the film for in the first
place - fun and humour. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are some amusing
parts of the film, but these are relatively few and far between. Have
you ever seen the film &#x27;Brain Dead&#x27;? There is a very violent and very
funny scene in that film whereby the lead attacks some zombies with a
lawnmower. It&#x27;s funny because of the music, the comic expressions of
the actors and subtle silliness throughout. &#x27;Hobo&#x27; has almost NONE of
the funny part.<br /><br />What really doesn&#x27;t help matters is the pacing of the film. It starts
of fairly slow, then you get a massive dose of violence to the point
where it almost becomes boring. Then bizarrely, the film slows down in
a hospital scene that seems to take its mood and music directly from
&#x27;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&#x27;. This film really dragged for me and my
friends - we were not impressed.<br /><br />I honestly don&#x27;t understand how they messed this film up. The premise
sounds amazing - one hobo with a shotgun. It&#x27;s not trying to be the
Shawshank Redemption, there are few ingredients needed for this pot.
How did they get it wrong? By trying to be violent and sick first, then
funny and entertaining second.<br /><br />If you are the type to be easily amused by gratuitous violence then
this may float your boat, but for everyone else it remains a really
disappointing film. &#x27;More is less&#x27; has never been more apt.<br /><br />See the 2010 film Machete instead, it&#x27;s vastly superior.
