Really nothing for weak nerves. Children and juveniles stay away.
Reminds me of the senseless raw brute violence movies from the 80&#x27;s.<br /><br />For my taste Rutger Hauer is back after &#x22;The Hitcher, 1986&#x22;. Finally!<br /><br />Not to be taken serious, just entertaining for 90 min. Also the movie
has a touch of &#x22;Clockwork Orange&#x22;. The bad guys get confronted with
their deeds from the beginning. <br /><br />The actors are B-Movie actors, all of them, including Rutger, but they
do a good job. There is no boring time, or almost none. <br /><br />If you like continuous action, this is it. There is also a message and
sense in it, like in every movie, despite of the constant voices of the
&#x22;independent intellectual boring to death&#x22; movie fans. The message is:
It can get really nasty in a world of full anarchy. Some decency and
respect is the best way to go through life.
