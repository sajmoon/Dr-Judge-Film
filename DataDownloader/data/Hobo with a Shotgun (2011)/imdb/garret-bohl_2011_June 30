Ah, I had so much fun with this movie; it was a great throwback to a
genre I really love, the Grind House genre, and it seemed to almost go
even further with the blood and violence. Sometimes I just really enjoy
a movie like this, when I&#x27;m craving a good action movie, and this
definitely filled that craving.<br /><br />Now there are a great many people I would not recommend this movie to,
like my parents for instance, as it has some of the most graphic scenes
I have seen in a movie in quite a while, and I watch a lot of these
types of movies. So it&#x27;s probably not a great choice if you don&#x27;t like
that stuff. However if you do, I believe this movie is definitely a
must see and it is a really great and exciting indie film.<br /><br />I really liked the setting and style of this movie. It is set in a
decrepit city where everything good has given way to violence and
torture, and everywhere you look there are just bad things happening.
It reminded me greatly of a post-apocalyptic setting with violent
gangs, but it&#x27;s just this town that has given way to madness. They were
also very creative when they made this movie, especially in coming up
with creative and disgusting ways of killing people, and it is a very
eerie film to watch which definitely has plenty of thriller moments.<br /><br />I also liked the story of this movie overall, and it seems to say
something about where our world maybe could end up heading, as
corruption takes over their city. The old homeless man and a young
woman he meets develop a great relationship, and they learn a great
amount from each other by the end of the movie, having no one else at
all to turn to. I felt like I really came to connect and care for them
both and I definitely felt sad for them, which is a plus for me when I
care about the characters at the end.<br /><br />Overall I think this was a great action/grind house flick and if you
like those or similar genres, I would definitely recommend you go see
it. It&#x27;s one I will definitely continue to watch again in the future
and it will probably be one of my first choices when I just want to
watch a crazy-ass movie again.
