If you want a cheesy Troma-esque action/comedy/horror romp, look no
further than Hobo With a Shotgun. I saw this movie this afternoon and
it BLEW ME AWAY! It was funny, the music was good, the acting fit the
movie perfectly (meaning that no Oscars will be awarded, but the actors
knew what they were doing), and it had a bunch of memorable scenes.<br /><br />The guy who plays the hobo did a great job, IMO. He looked like a hobo,
talked like a hobo, and had the ambition of a mega-hobo. The main
female actor was great too. She added a tiny bit of depth to the movie
and had good hobo-chemistry. The bad guys were all stellar,
over-the-top crazy evil dudes. They were all outstanding.<br /><br />My one caveat is for squeamish viewers, because although the gore in
this movie is cartoonish and unbelievable, there is a lot of it and
some of the scenes are graphic. If you have a weak stomach, steer clear
of this movie. If you like crazy gore-fest/comedy action b-movies with
good one-liners and outrageous villains, you have to see this amazing
piece of Canadian cinema!
