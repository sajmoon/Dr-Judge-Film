First and foremost this movie is called &#x27;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x27; - and
that is EXACTLY what you are going to get! If you are considering a
movie called &#x27;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x27; but are turned off by violence, then
this is NOT the movie for you. Move along.<br /><br />The movie starts off with our title character riding into a crime
ridden town during the mid 80&#x27;s that is run by an excessively brutal
crime lord and his two psychopath sons. After witnessing first hand how
morally decayed this town is, our hobo delivers his own brand of
justice - shotgun style! I&#x27;m a fan of the revival of the grindhouse
genre and was thoroughly pleased by this addition. This movie showed
some crazy violent stuff that - being a fan of horror movies and the
grindhouse types - I hadn&#x27;t seen before. The whole film was delivered
in a very self-aware and somewhat campy fashion which adds to the
delight of watching it. This film was well made and a lot of fun to
watch. Some pizza and a couple of beers just added to the enjoyment.
Guys rent it, watch it with a couple of buddies, but keep the girls
far, far away.
