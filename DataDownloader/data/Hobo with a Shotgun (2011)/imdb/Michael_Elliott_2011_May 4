Hobo With a Shotgun (2011) <br /><br />*** (out of 4)<br /><br />Based on a trailer that appeared in the Canadian version of GRINDHOUSE,
this feature-length version is certainly a throwback to 70s cinema as
we get just about every type of sleaze imaginable. In the film Rutger
Hauer plays the hobo who comes into a crooked town that is full of just
about every type of scumbag that you can imagine. The homeless man just
wants enough money to buy a lawn mower so that he can start a job but
instead the injustice nearly kills him so he grabs a shotgun and goes
after all the scum. HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN isn&#x27;t a masterpiece and at
times it&#x27;s not even a good movie but in the end there&#x27;s no question
that it delivers what genre fans will want and that&#x27;s sleaze and gore.
I think the best thing going for the movie is the performance by Hauer
who has no trouble fitting into the part. The actor does a very good
job at actually building up a character who we can cheer for as well as
feel for. Hauer has always played tough guys so he&#x27;s also easy to
believe in the part of a kick ass vigilante who can wipe out the
crooked cops and dirty gangsters in the streets. The film really does
love its title because we get all sorts of gory violence wrapped around
this shotgun. The film really seems to enjoy decapitations because
there are quite a few heads that get ripped and blown off. One of the
highlights includes a scene where a man has a pothole cover wrapped
around his neck and then he&#x27;s place into the hole, which of course only
leaves his head in the street. A certain item is then wrapped around
his neck when a car takes off and the blood really starts to flow but
the scene doesn&#x27;t stop there because a hot stripper then jumps in a
takes a shower in the blood. There are all sorts of outrageous and
over-the-top scenes like this and we even get some taboo stuff like a
Santa Claus who likes to kidnap kids and we even get a scene where he&#x27;s
sitting outside their school and masturbating. You can tell that the
film&#x27;s humor is all over the place as it really doesn&#x27;t shy away from
any type of violence including plenty towards some children. One scene
has are bad guys burning some children alive on their school bus. Hauer
is very good in his role but he gets some nice support from Molly
Dunsworth who plays a hooker who befriends the hobo. Again, HOBO WITH A
SHOTGUN isn&#x27;t a great movie and its appeal is going to be extremely
limited but for the most part I had a good time watching it. I think
the actual &#x22;story&#x22; is quite weak and it takes about thirty-minutes for
it to really get going but the lead actor is so good and the gore so
strong that I think its target audience will enjoy.
