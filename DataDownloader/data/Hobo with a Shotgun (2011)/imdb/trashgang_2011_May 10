Rutger Hauer is back. And let me say that he IS back. Man, did I
enjoyed this exploitation. Be honest, the score is back to the
grindhouse era, the sun into the lens of the camera giving all those
flair faults like in the heydays, the yellow credits and the way they
were shown. And then of course the way they exploit the gore and red
stuff. I thought Machete was a way to go but Hobo goes much further.
Jason Eisener, the director made contact to put his fake trailer in
between the grindhouse flicks of Rodriguez and Tarantino. They did and
immediately it became a fav of the geeks together with Machete and
Werewolf Women Of The SS. Jason had a wet dream about putting Rutger as
a main lead, and by stupid circumstances he was able to contact him and
Rutger agreed. I know that some people will have difficulties with the
last 20 minutes when the squid appears as did The Plague but that&#x27;s
what exploitation and grindhouse is all about. But the gore is extreme
here, when someone is shot the red stuff do flies in gallons and the
decapitation in the beginning is so well done. Knowing that Robert
Rodriguez helped Ethan Maniquis to direct Machete and that this is
Jason&#x27;s first attempt I go for Hobo, much gorier and without the big
names. So now it&#x27;s up to Werewolf Women Of The SS. Way to go, back
memory lane to exploitation field.
