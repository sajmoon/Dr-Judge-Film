Although I get what this movie was trying to do, this film lacked
humor, an interesting plot, a minutia of tension, a compelling cast of
characters in spite of having a talented lead, and even a level of
energy that compels viewers to go back for a second round.<br /><br />It tried to be edgy, especially with a scene where the bad guys are
roasting children alive (bravo), but ultimately the film just falls
flat on it&#x27;s empty face.<br /><br />I&#x27;d even say the films it tries to parody/satirize or even pay homage
to, were way more successful. Which is sad, because the movie looked
like it should have been more fun than it ultimately was.<br /><br />The movie is very much like the Hobo With a Shotgun iphone video game,
which IGN described as &#x22;...an amateur production that provides no
giggles and no fun&#x22;. I couldn&#x27;t have said it better.<br /><br />This should have remained a spoof trailer.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
