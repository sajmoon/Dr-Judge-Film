&#x22;Crime in this city has become an embarrassment.&#x22; After getting off a
train in &#x22;Hope Town&#x22;, the Hobo (Hauer) thinks he has found a new start.
What he found is a city bathed in crime and trash the likes of which
the world has never seen. After finally hitting his breaking point he
decides to clean up the town, with a shotgun. The next movie in the
&#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; series. If you have seen the others or are familiar with
the old style &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; movies you will know what to expect. If you
are are unaware of what this is you will be shocked beyond repair. This
is not a movie for everyone, if you are at all queasy or easily
offended then you should avoid this movie at all costs. For those that
know what this type of movie is you still may be shocked. A lot of the
way you feel about movies has to do with your expectations going in. If
you have low expectations even a bad movie can seem good. That is what
this was to me. After watching &#x22;Machete&#x22; my theory was that this will
suck. This is by no means an Oscar type movie, or even a good movie for
that matter, but it was much better then I expected. Like the other
&#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; movies this one is very, very over the top in terms of
gore and violence. The one thing this had that the other three didn&#x27;t
is that this one tried to be more serious. While there is definite
cheese in this, it didn&#x27;t try to be something it&#x27;s not. Overall, the
only thing I can really say about this is that this movie is exactly
what you would expect from a movie called &#x22;Hobo with a shotgun&#x22;. I give
it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don&#x27;t think I will *Also try - Machete &#x26; Death
Proof
