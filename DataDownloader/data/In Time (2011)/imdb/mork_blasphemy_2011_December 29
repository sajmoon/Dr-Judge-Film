this one surprised me as i don&#x27;t think that actor is particularly good
but he was very well in this one though!!This movie had a bit of
everything that my generation likes[30-38 years old] It was sci-fi
enough without exaggerating,the plot was super original,we never seen
anything like this on any other movie so thats always a plus as long as
it is a compelling thing, doesn&#x27;t need to be believable but it can&#x27;t be
ridiculous,and this movie balanced it very well!!I can say i was
entretained throughout the entire movie,but there was a major fault of
absolute stupidity and I bet everyone was thinking the same (SPOILER
ALERT) When they stole 1 Million years,and then a little bit after they
were running for their lives,why not take even if it was 1 year so they
could do what they had to do????Isn&#x27;t that stupid,one of them almost
dying cause they weren&#x27;t smart enough to think 1 hour ahead in a world
where 1 hour could mean life or death???? With this I finish my review
with the almost only detail that could have ruined the entire movie as
it was a part of the ending!!
