This is the worst movie I have ever watched. It seemed like a good
idea, and possibly a good action flick. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I was actually very mad while watching it. I felt like the movie wasted
2 hours of my life. I cannot believe they allowed to be released. I
cannot believe other people enjoyed it. Do not spend a dime on this
movie. I found myself finishing it just to see how bad Justin
Timberlake has ruined his career.<br /><br />Terrible dialog, cheesy lines that don&#x27;t make sense, horrific
directing, and Justin Timberlake cannot act to save his life. Could
have been a decent movie with better writers, better leading actor, and
a good director.
