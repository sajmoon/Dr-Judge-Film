I had the privilege of watching this movie earlier than most people in
the world because its released early in Malaysia, to profit from
Deepavali public holiday crowd on 26 Oct.<br /><br />The story is simple. Time is the commodity in the future. But the best
part is how the filmmaker show the audience how to use this commodity
in normal everyday life. How much time you pay for certain things,
where to get extra time, etc. Simply brilliant.<br /><br />I never cared too much about Timberlake before, but his performance in
Social Network caught my attention, and In Time further proves that he
can act. The pace can be quite a drag here and there, but its full of
suspense all the way, many chase scenes and all.<br /><br />For those of you who are tired of prequels, sequels, three-quels,
superheros, robots, aliens, etc, give In Time a shot, its definitely
worth your time. The most original movie this year. 109 minutes is a
commodity well-spent.
