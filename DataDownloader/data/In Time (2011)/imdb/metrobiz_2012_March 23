Usually I don&#x27;t like, don&#x27;t watch sci-fi. But the reviews here &#x26;
elsewhere were intriguing, transcending the genre. And Amanda Seyfried
usually is watchable no matter what. Dropping a dollar in the red
vending machine turned-out to be rewarding cinematically.<br /><br />This film has been called an &#x22;action movie,&#x22; a &#x22;sci-fi&#x22; flick. What it
is is an ingenious &#x22;morality play.&#x22; Congratulations to the
writer/director and Fox for greenlighting it, no pun intended relative
to the embedded arm timer(s).<br /><br />We&#x27;ve all heard, ad nauseum, that &#x22;time is money.&#x22; And that&#x27;s the
poetry of this production, to take that which is ordinary, known,
obvious maybe, oft stated, and overlooked, and restate it in a way that
captures and captivates. In this film time IS money, and therein also
is its genius of concept and revelation.<br /><br />Is the plot perfect in every regard about which some reviewers are
nitpicking? Not sure; probably not. It&#x27;s not important though. It&#x27;s
close enough to be sufficiently provoking. And it&#x27;s original,
creatively so.<br /><br />TIME also is LIFE itself, stating the obvious. Without it, money does
not matter, the old &#x22;you can&#x27;t take it with you.&#x22; And by flipping the
time-is-money thing used mostly by bosses of the world as a people-prod
- those who have plenty of money that others often are making for them
- it hits close enough to human nature to make one think sitting there
in the cinema seat, on the couch, commenting on how we value what we
have, or don&#x27;t have - and those who are greedy hoarders. Those who have
TIME have LIFE. And since time is currency in the film&#x27;s world, it
shows us ourselves in an original, clever, and even poetic way - in
today&#x27;s cinema vernacular of guns, action, and violence.<br /><br />The one-day-at-a-time sub-theme was interesting &#x26; stimulating.<br /><br />This film is an intelligent concept staffed with actors good enough to
make it really interesting. Timberlake was fine, even well cast;
Seyfriend is nearly always totally watchable, and is here, too. Her
make-up and hair was effective, almost subduing the Seyfriend look,
while emphasizing it for a futuro effect. Good job.<br /><br />The &#x27;70&#x27;s retro-techno-non-piston (I think) cars were a warpish
concept, interesting for some kind of future world &#x26; alternate universe
environment. (&#x27;70&#x27;s Detroit product was America&#x27;s ugly automotive
nadir, opening the door for the Japanese.) However, as other reviewers
have noted, the Jag car crash early in the film looks like &#x27;50&#x27;s model
not-so-special effects. It&#x27;s so bad it seems out-of-place in a film
that otherwise is slick. The money must&#x27;ve run out here in the real
world ...<br /><br />Filmed with the ARRI Alexa, the digital capture uses a lot of the ugly
fluorescent green and sodium orange available practicals of our real
world. But it&#x27;s effective, especially for the grittier parts of the
action. To see how digital and available light can look superb, see
Soderbergh&#x27;s &#x22;Contagion.&#x22;<br /><br />As for &#x22;In Time,&#x22; it&#x27;s that rare original concept where the Hollywoodie
stars &#x26; production make it work effectively &#x26; provocatively. Bravo.
