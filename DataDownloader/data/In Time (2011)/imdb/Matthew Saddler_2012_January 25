The concept of the underlying idea is excellent. I am not very picky,
there may be some minor flaws in the execution. Like woman running very
fast with high heel shoes, or people swimming in deep water without
never touching the ocean in their life. I can cope with these little
issues with no problem. As long as there is no major absurdity that
contradict the main theme.<br /><br />What I find as a flaw, and this is just my personal opinion, is that
the concept is too simplistic. I find unrealistic that the &#x22;poor&#x22;
people in such a society could be that law abiding. These &#x22;poor&#x22; people
are more civilized than most of the richest men on Earth today! With
real human behaviour, a country like that will actually turn into chaos
in no time.
