I should have learned that when it comes to thoughtful, original,
creative &#x22;speculative fiction&#x22; films, that many of the brain dead
reviewers would dismiss IN TIME.<br /><br />BIG mistake. Epic fail.<br /><br />IN TIME is one of the best concepts of any movie I&#x27;ve ever seen, and I
have a chunk of decades behind me. If it were not for the relatively
bland handling of the love story elements, I would give this film a 10.
The dystopian &#x22;feel&#x22; of IN TIME is similar to that of GATTACA, also an
Andrew Niccol film.<br /><br />That IN TIME is an effective metaphor on the current world state of
capitalism and class structure, and other deeper issues should not
preclude going for the sheer action/drama thrills of popcorn moviedom.<br /><br />Open your mind, get a large popcorn and enjoy IN TIME. Your brain and
heart will appreciate it.
