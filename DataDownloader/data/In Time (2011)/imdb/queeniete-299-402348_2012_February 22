A very excellent movie, In Time is just as good as other popular sci-fi
movies like Inception, Star Trek, Star Wars and a lot more. Not only
did this movie make the watchers tingle on their seats but also teach
them some life lessons. I personally recommend this movie to those who
love the world of technology. I really liked this movie and it has
blown me off from the very beginning of the story.<br /><br />I could prove that this is an excellent movie for three reasons. First,
it has very captivating effects. Every sci-fi movie needs to have good
effects, or else they wouldn&#x27;t be called sci-fi. This movie has
succeeded in capturing the eyes of many watchers. Second, the concept
of the movie is unique. Whoever thought of the plot has a very creative
mind. True, it may seem unrealistic but still, the plot was very
appealing and definitely worth watching. Lastly, the morals watchers
could get from this movie. It shows us that discrimination between the
rich and poor still exists, even in the future. Watchers can relate to
this since that discrimination is still evident in the present. It also
implies that not all the wealthy succeed in the end.<br /><br />I hope that the movie industry would make movies like this one. It will
surely bring success to the entertainment industry and perhaps, change
the world of technology.
