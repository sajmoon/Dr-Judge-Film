As others have said, the idea of this movie was excellent. You could
call it a skeptical analogy of what is happening in some parts of the
world &#x96; the richest people of the planet abusing poor.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie, especially in the early stages, was how
much the movie made me think. It was also bizarre to think of what
things would be like if nobody looked older than 25. The movie played
upon the possibility of multiple generations would look the same age &#x96;
at least for those rich enough to afford to purchase the additional
years. The story was also well thought out in relation to how people
would act within the differing classes of society: the rich would take
their time and take few risks. The poor would treasure their time,
moving quickly, and, with less to lose, would be less risk adverse.<br /><br />Great premise, great start to the movie, decent follow-through.
Although I wish the strong start was able to be carried throughout the
movie, I found this movie quite enjoyable to watch.
