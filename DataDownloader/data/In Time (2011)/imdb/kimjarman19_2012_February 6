Well this film was surprisingly better than I was expecting it to be..
Justin Timberlake isn&#x27;t a very strong actor in my opinion, but he took
the spotlight in this one. Amanda Seyfried looked beautiful as ever
with her little bob, and the acting really wasn&#x27;t too bad.<br /><br />There&#x27;s sad and happy moments all with that little bit of constant
tension as you&#x27;ll find if you watch it.<br /><br />It was a really good concept and an enjoyable film, I gave it an 8/10
as I think they could&#x27;ve thought of a better lead actor but it was
enjoyable none the less. I would recommend it to anyone, it doesn&#x27;t
really ever become boring and the tension keeps you focused at all
times.
