had moderate expectations for the film and have proceeded to watch it
over and over. The production style is stunning...taking some of the
more gritty areas of LA and hitting them with the right lights, angles,
colors and filters and making this movie mesmerizing. Master directing,
editing, design.<br /><br />And then to add to the visual intrigue....the topic reflecting how we
plan our days. Since watching the movie I&#x27;ve caught myself several
times commenting on &#x27;if we have time today&#x27; &#x27;what time is it&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t
want to waste time...&#x27; and disturbed on how I&#x27;m spending my own time.<br /><br />Do we ever really know how much time we have left on any given day?
