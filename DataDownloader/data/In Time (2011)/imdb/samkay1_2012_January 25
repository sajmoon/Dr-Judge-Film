2012_January 25 
In a society where time is money (yes literally, time is the new
currency), and the average citizen is programmed to live twenty-five
years, a poor kid from the slums finds himself on the run when he is
accused of illegally holding a hundred and ten years on his life clock.<br /><br />I see a great idea behind In Time, but it never aspires to anything
more than a chase scene movie. Andrew Nichol&#x27;s third feature works on a
superficially as an action film that doesn&#x27;t rely on bullets and
explosions, but the experience feels a bit too much like a video game.
(especially when the characters are constantly rushing to refuel their
time clock). Characterization is fairly wooden, and the whole movie is
cut together in a manner that makes you feel like it&#x27;s all taking place
within a few city blocks. I would have liked to have seen a bit more
helicopter mounted camera work myself.<br /><br />Although he&#x27;s far from being a good actor, Justin Timberlake is good at
making a boring character feel less boring, by bringing some energy.
Here, that&#x27;s definitely a positive. Part of Timberlake&#x27;s strength of
course is that he has wit. The same cannot be said about Amanda
Seyfried, who is once again adorably boring. That said, perhaps she
shows a little improvement over her last couple performances.<br /><br />What bothers me most about In Time however, is the credibility of the
setting. Of all the Orwellian societies I&#x27;ve seen in the movies, this
is the one that struck me as the one that would never function. Nichol
has taken a potent concept and put it forward in a kind of B- grade
fashion. It&#x27;s not impossible to watch, but it&#x27;s not really worth
watching.
