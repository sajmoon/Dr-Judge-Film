Andrew Niccol obviously plays with Marxist ideas. What a nice example
of how the profit-hungry Hollywood machinery ones more proves its
dynamic flexibility by fulfilling the current demand for critical
thoughts on our capitalist system.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that In Time is a sci-fi, one should not be
overcritical with small discrepancies, such as Amanda Seyfried always
running with high heels. Comparing time with money, however, is not
only a creative approach, in combination with surprisingly good (or at
least acceptable good) actors and nice pictures this movie is
definitely worth watching it.
