In the world of &#x22;In Time&#x22;, time is money. Literally. Set in a future
where everybody ages until 25, then they have one year left to live,
except that one year is currency. The rich can live at age 25 eternally
and the poor don&#x27;t always have a chance to live. Time zones are classes
of wealth and you can&#x27;t cross over without upsetting the order of the
world. It&#x27;s quite possible that they have taken this time is money
equation too far.<br /><br />But I enjoyed this twist on the same old action movie. It even starts
with some thoughts on philosophy. A rich boy finds himself in a poor
man&#x27;s bar where everybody wants a piece of him, so much so that his
considerable wealth and time line are in danger. While the poor are in
constant need of money, it turns out that the rich don&#x27;t have the same
drives for life. This rich guy is impressed by Will&#x27;s (Justin
Timberlake) honesty and earnest desire to find out how the other side
lives. Will is then faced with the possibility of an infinite life time
of money.<br /><br />From there, we get a Robin Hood action movie. Will pairs up with a
daddy&#x27;s girl vixen, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and they are on the run
from the time keepers (Cillian Murphy). I have enjoyed Timberlake&#x27;s
recent foray into the world of movie stars, but I like him more as a
comedic straight man than as an action hero. Seyfried, on the other
hand, proves that she can play pretty much anything. A mysteriously
innocent, sharp-shooting, sexy action girl suits her well.<br /><br />The logic that this new world presents is pretty easy to figure out,
but as you are doing that at least you are distracted from the usual
action movie set-up. Hollywood has ventured again into the science
fiction romance genre, and has again come out with an intelligent,
action-packed film with something for everyone.
