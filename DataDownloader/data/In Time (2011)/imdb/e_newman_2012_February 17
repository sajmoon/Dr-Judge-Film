I found this movie to not only be engaging, but refreshing in its
originality. In an era where remakes and comic book story lines have
been exhausted, it&#x27;s nice to sit and watch something original. I was
surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie. I feel as
though everything this movie attempted to address, it nailed. From the
lack of balance and equality among the haves and have-nots, to the
credible depiction of an age-old comparison of time and money- they do
a fantastic job of taking something we&#x27;ve all thought about, and making
into an entertaining, action packed, thought provoking movie.<br /><br />I also think Timberlake brought the intensity that the role deserved
and required, and I can&#x27;t think of any actor that would have served the
role better. He left nothing to be desired when it comes to bringing
his character to life. The notion that for a few to be immortal, many
must die is the crux of the film, and it subtly addresses that reality
in our society using an imaginative story line. Great movie, and kudos
for originality.
