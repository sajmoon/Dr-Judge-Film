This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the
commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to
live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all
depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more.
Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically
remains looking twenty five.<br /><br />On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his
misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing
Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is
definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such
chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The
Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for
Friends with Benefits (2011). <br /><br />The script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too
familiar words, &#x22;We don&#x27;t have time...we don&#x27;t have time...&#x22; Think if
today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or
cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs
two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don&#x27;t run
out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you
treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may
be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see
it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of
cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite
the wealthy in today&#x27;s world sometimes being able to cheat a few years
with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average
years.<br /><br />While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and
his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages
of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People
who have time, like the mega &#x22;eonaire&#x22; Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and
his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle
to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the
chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just
decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to &#x22;time out.&#x22; He
leaves Will the prophetic warning &#x22;Don&#x27;t waste my time.&#x22; How Will
chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is
now the story.<br /><br />I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not
futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970&#x27;s models with
updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget
rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or
so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.<br /><br />As an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought
provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this
film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is
ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down
clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your
time is about up.<br /><br />This film...it&#x27;s worth your time.
