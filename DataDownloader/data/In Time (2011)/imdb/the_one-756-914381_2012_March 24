This is a movie surprisingly refreshing. Not only the idea (some
reviewers pointed out that that&#x27;s not quite new; regardless, it&#x27;s
certainly new in a movie, and here works superbly), but the movie
itself. Without aiming too high (still much more than average though),
this movie really works - at all levels.<br /><br />The last one to make you think (as to new ideas into play) in the last
15 years or so (Inception) failed - was too full of itself (see my
review on that one). This one on the other hand, works differently
(more than average on everything: acting, camera work, music etc. and
especially the story), and guess what? It works. You won&#x27;t see any cool
FX here, but what you&#x27;ll see is far from cheap too.<br /><br />On the other hand, it&#x27;s also low on violence, swearing, and sexual
content (without which, apparently, you can&#x27;t make a movie nowadays) -
which means your entire family can enjoy it - as long as they had
already jump-started their brains.<br /><br />So don&#x27;t expect the cool FX from Matrix, but not the diluted and full
of holes story from Equilibrium either. Rounded, surprising little gem,
worth seeing more than twice. I had already planned to buy the DVD -
and haven&#x27;t bought one in several years, which should tell you
something. These are not the days you build up a collection.
Unfortunately, these are the days you rent your 2 hrs. entertainment,
then immediately forget it (the dose to make you run another day - how
cheap we have become).<br /><br />Its real value is at a solid 8, but I give it a full 9 only for the
(courage and) novelty of being novel.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
