Where to begin? Every aspect of this movie was so bad I don&#x27;t even know
how to. I sincerely despair of the world after finding out this has a
6.6 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. This is way worse than global
warming, overpopulation, rising garbage mountains, ozone holes or any
other reasons one might despair for the human race. This means the
great majority of people, assuming the average moviegoers are a good
representative of people in general, are utterly and plainly stupid and
with no means whatsoever to distinguish quality from pure trash.<br /><br />Now I always try to be as just as possible when reviewing a movie and I
can definitely see a movie for what it is and see its qualities even
though I don&#x27;t necessarily belong to its target audience. Here however
I can&#x27;t see how any adult could possibly find this anything other than
offensively bad, save for it being a total moron. The directing and
editing is awful, the shift between scenes is awkward and seems more
amateurish than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen in this budget scale. The plot
is really stupid and has more holes than I can count. I would have
given a few examples but then I&#x27;d have to mark this review as
containing spoilers which would shun people who haven&#x27;t seen it from
reading the review and spoil the opportunity to deter them from doing
so. The dialogue is absolutely laughable as well but the worst part of
it all is the horrible acting. It&#x27;s really like watching amateur
theatre. Especially bad is the portrayal of the wealthy Mr. Weis, a
powerful and incredibly wealthy old man, albeit inside a 25 year old
body, who still comes across as insecure and awkward as a timid
teenager. Surely this has got to be the worst casting mistake ever?<br /><br />And what&#x27;s up with the whole Bonnie and Clyde bit in the last half
hour? Seriously it was one of the lamest things I&#x27;ve ever seen. I can&#x27;t
fathom how this piece of trash was even allowed to be made or how
people in general seem to appreciate it. Seriously, I despair of
Hollywood, I despair of the future of film making in general and I
despair of this idiot generation of ours.
