In a future society, people are genetically modified to stop aging at
twenty five and after that a clock is activated with one more year for
each citizen. Time is a currency and the wealthy that live in the New
Greenwich are immortals while the poor live in ghettos in Time Zones
are exploited and forced to live with a few hours or days, and need to
work, borrow, beg or steal to stay alive. Thieves steal time and the
timekeepers control the society.<br /><br />When the worker Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) saves the rich Henry
Hamilton (Matt Bomer) from a dangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells
that he is 105 years old and is tired of living, since there is no need
for the deaths. When Will sleeps, Henry gives more than one hundred
years to him and commits suicide. Will runs to meet his mother Rachel
Salas (Olivia Wilde) to credit time to her but she dies before the
transference.<br /><br />Will heads to New Greenwich but the timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian
Murphy) believes that he killed Henry to steal his time. Will flirts
with Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), who is the spoiled daughter of the
millionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), in a party and when
Raymond arrests him, Will Salas kidnaps Sylvia and brings her to the
ghetto where he lives. Sylvia feels how despicable her father is and
together with Will, they steal a large quantity of time to fight
against the system.<br /><br />&#x22;In Time&#x22; is a film that presents a fight of classes based in time. The
story is a combination of &#x22;Logan&#x27;s Run&#x22;, &#x22;Equilibrium&#x22;, &#x22;Bonnie and
Clyde&#x22; and &#x22;Robin Hood&#x22; and entertains. However the screenplay and the
execution do not work well and the film is a little disappointing,
wasting a good concept. My vote is six.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;O Pre&#xE7;o do Amanh&#xE3;&#x22; (&#x22;The Price of Tomorrow&#x22;)
