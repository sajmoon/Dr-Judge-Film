All I&#x27;ve read here is people critiquing the movie&#x27;s flaws, while no one
seems to understand the message behind this movie.<br /><br />The whole movie is a metaphor for the real world capitalism. So what if
the SFX is a bit weak, some actors could have been better, maybe there
are a few plot holes, but the story being told is so true to our
everyday lives.<br /><br />My brother recommended me this movie, so we watched it together, and
when it came to an end, I turned over and said &#x22;This is the best movie
of 2011, At least&#x22;.<br /><br />It is complex, and at the same time it&#x27;s simple.<br /><br />Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a movie to get you thinking, this is it!
