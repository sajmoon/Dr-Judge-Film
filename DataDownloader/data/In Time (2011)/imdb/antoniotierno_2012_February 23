A science-fiction movie set in a future where people could live
forever, if they didn&#x27;t have a time limit on their lives. It shows a
very good plot and continues having a lot to say. Justin Timberlake and
Amanda Seyfried are the futuristic Bonnie and Clyde, whose destinies
are crossed with Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving it to
the poor. The movie is decent, acting-wise, and soon turns into a chase
film examining all the possible moral quandaries. Cillian Murphy as
well, playing a Timekeeper &#x97; cop charged with making sure people stay
where their place in society &#x97; is an interesting character. In Time has
its rhythm in the right place, it&#x27;s not a masterpiece but certainly
clever and original.
