Seyfried is very good, her character is credible; Timberlake&#x27;s not so
much, he is too detached. I would give her 9/10 and him 6/10. Murphy&#x27;s
cop is pretty good, too. I cannot decide on the banker, I keep seeing
him as his character in Mad Men. The local bad guy and his gang need an
upgrade to be more believable. The movie plot is good but some of the
technological advances are far-fetched when compared to other aspects
of the world these people live in. There are other minor &#x22;glitches&#x22;,
such as the girl who shoots so well from a distance the first time but
then apparently needs to learn how to fire a gun. Anyway, I think this
movie is a message to politicians -- not that I expect any of them to
watch it.
