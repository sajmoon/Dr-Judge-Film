I had In Time on in the background as my in-flight movie while I was
doing &#x22;stuff&#x22; on my laptop, as I felt it was the right level of
attention for a film which hadn&#x27;t really received enough hype or
recommendation to be really worthy of my attention.<br /><br />And that&#x27;s about right. The film has an interesting concept, and the
production spend is good, but it feels like an interesting concept that
has been &#x27;dumbed down&#x27; and not properly explored, in order to fit into
a big-budget action flick.<br /><br />However, the day later, the more I thought about it, the more the
concept grew on me. I realised that while the movie didn&#x27;t really
explore the concept of time as a currency as much as, say, an
independent movie might, it did at least present them.... And with
them, the underlying social inequalities present in today&#x27;s society.<br /><br />If you read the film in this way - as a metaphor for current social and
political challenges, such as the fact that billions of people in
poverty do live day-to-day, with a bad day meaning death from
malnutrition - then it&#x27;s a powerful film. There are also lots of time-
money set piece situations that range from fun to thought-provoking.
It&#x27;s just that this potential underlying message is lost in the
screenplay and production style.<br /><br />On balance - yes, this film is worth watching for those reasons, while
the big budget production makes it easy enough to watch, whatever you
take away from it.
