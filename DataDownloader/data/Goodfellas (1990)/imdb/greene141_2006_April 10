I absolutely love this film. I saw it a few years back for the first
time and remember loving it immediately but it has taken several recent
viewings for me to truly realise how much class the film actually
contains. Be it Scorcesses stunning direction that really places the
audience into this audacious lifestyle or the casts consistently note
perfect performances. Although both Deniro and Liotta are brilliant it
is Pesci that is the real don in this mafioso pic. It is a true
testament to his abilities that you begin to laugh with this brutal
murderer, a man who in one of the films most powerful moments murders
an innocent man for the fear of losing some of the macho image that a
lot of this lifestyle is built on. A hilarious, powerful and ultimately
fascinating modern classic.
