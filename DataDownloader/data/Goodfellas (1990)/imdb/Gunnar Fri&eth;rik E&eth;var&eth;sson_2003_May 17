Goodfellas is one of my favourite films. I am not a big fan of these
gangster film and often find them to be boring. But it is not the case with
Goodfellas which is masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese who has not made
a movie that follows this one. <br /><br />This film has it all drama, extreme violent, huge amount of drug use and
humor. I also like the character building in this flick which is indeed the
main key in its greatness. How Henry (Liotta) tells the story. It is also
fun to watch and unlike many other gangster or mafia films it is not boring
and every scene is good. A Wonderful film that everyone should own.
9/10.
