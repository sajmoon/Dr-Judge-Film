First off, the Academy Awards have been wrong before like with Raging
Bull in 1980 or with Gangs of New York in 2002 but the Academy really
screwed over Goodfellas in 1990. It received 6 nominations including
Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay but it only walked away with Joe
Pesci&#x27;s astounding supporting actor roll. The movie starts with the
narration which sort of guides you in the right direction if you don&#x27;t
know what the hell is going on but it is pretty hard to loose track.
Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career as mobster Henry Hill
who was arrested in 1980 and went into Witness Protection to save his
ass from his &#x22;pals&#x22;. Scorsese takes the gangster genre to another level
with this film, he uses Thelma Schoonmaker to give the movie amazing
editing which it also deserved an Oscar for. But...Robert DeNiro steals
the show as Hill&#x27;s close friend and mentor Jimmy Conway who is a
veteran at being a thief, gunman, and hijacker. DeNiro steals the show
as playing a wise guy/nice guy and a ruthless killer and lets not
forget about Pesci who just plays a freakin&#x27; psycho who doesn&#x27;t give a
crap about human life. You screw with him, you&#x27;re dead. You&#x27;re nice to
him, watch out cause he doesn&#x27;t care. He kills for fun but he;s even
crazier when insulted. Scorsese deserved a Best Director Oscar because
in my life of watching many films and studying them, there is not quite
a film like Goodfellas. It is the modern version of The Godfather.
Excellent film and worth the 145 minutes to watch.
