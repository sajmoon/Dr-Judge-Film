Goodfellas to me is not only the best film of 1990 and a milestone of
90s&#39; cinema, but also a fine learning experience of the ins-and-outs of
mob life from it&#39;s own words: Henry Hills personification of real life
former gangster Henry Hill is every bit as down to the book as Robert
Deniros&#39; relentless portrayal of boxer Jake Lamotta in the preceding(by
10 years!)classic Raging Bull. But Hill is not alone on this one along
with the returning Scorsese vets Deniro as mobster anarchist Jimmy
Conway and Joe Pesci as Jimmy&#39;s colorful, psychotic left hand man Tommy
Devito-whom of which Pesci deservedly won an Oscar for best supporting
actor. Add to that stunning performances by Paul Sorvino and Laurine
Bracko(plus a surprising small appearance of Pulp
Fiction-star-but-then-new-guy Samual L Jackson)and you have a cast for
the ages.<br /><br />Performances aside, this film probably gets closer to the mob world
then long winded epics like the Godfather or any other on screen
depiction of the sort. It&#39;s more like a documentary then an actual
movie. And I urge fans and first-time viewers to pick up the special
edition DVD which features audio commentary from the real Henry Hill
and one of the witness protection officers(whom also makes a cameo in
the film), among a hole lot of other extras.<br /><br />What Scorsese has created here is simply put: visual mob literature. A
true masterpiece among the Scorsese catalog.
