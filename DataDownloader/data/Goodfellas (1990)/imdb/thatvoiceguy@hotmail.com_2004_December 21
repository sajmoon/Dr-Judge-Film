This is one of THE definitive &quot;mobster&quot; films of all time. It's one of
Scorsese's best works, yet he ALWAYS ends up losing to someone less
deserving I mean Dances with Wolves was OK, i'm not going to say it
sucked at all, but come ON... I mean, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; losing to &quot;Rocky&quot;
is by FAR, one of the greatest upsets of all time I mean does the
Academy have a grudge against Scorsese? They never give him a directing
award or film...yet they'll give it to a movie about a boxer making his
way to the top living out the old &quot;American dream&quot; fantasy tale instead
of a dark look at the decay of human compassion, the deeper and darker
films And telling him to come to the 2003 Oscars just to watch all of
his 12 nominations win nothing, it's like an on going joke they are
playing on Scorsese Will somebody give this man an Oscar!!!
