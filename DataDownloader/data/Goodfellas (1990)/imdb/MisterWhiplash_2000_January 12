Martin Scorsese's &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is a sheer masterpiece if I've ever seen one.
 He has put together an excellent portrait of life in the gangster universe
not looked as well or in depth in &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  <br /><br />And of course the acting is what adds to the masterpiece like manner.  How
can you loose with Robert De Niro playing the cool head Jimmy Conway, Ray
Liotta playing the gangster want-to-be turned gangster Henry Hill, Joe Pesci
(in his definitely best and Oscar winning role) as the hot-head, joke
telling Tommy DeVito, Lorraine Bracco (in a Oscar nominated role) as Henry's
suspicious wife Karen Hill, and Paul Sorvino as the monarch Paul Cicero. 
And when you add a better than perfect script in the mix, you got some great
film making in the works.<br /><br />And the topping, Martin Scorsese.  A great film maker who got his second
Oscar nomination with his direction.  He makes the characters so bad that it
doesn't matter who is the most bad, because they are all truthfully equal in
badness.  But it is more than that, it is his passion for New York and the
way to make films that brings out the best in it (and don't forget the great
sound track and jokes by Joe Pesci).<br /><br />GoodFellas has it all- Violence, Comedy, Drama, and Romance.  Add a little
funny Pesci, a touch of great script, and top notch directing and acting and
you got a great film.  Nothing like this ever came around before 1990, it
astounded audiences in 1990, and nothing like it will ever come around
again.
