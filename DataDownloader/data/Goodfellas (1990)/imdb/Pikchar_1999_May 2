1999_May 2 

This Movie is one of my favorites. I'm not a big fan of Movies about
killing
and of violence, but this Movie definitely has something special in it.
The
acting is excellent- specially Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert de Niro.
The
script is also very good. I would give this Movie 8 1/2 on 10.
