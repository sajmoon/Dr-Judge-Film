This film is considered the definitive mob film, probably more because
Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the best living American director. If
Francis Ford Coppola (director of &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy) were still
alive,
he may disagree with this assessment -- and if he did, I would have to
agree
with him.<br /><br />Granted, the direction is brilliant, especially on the opening credits, the
beginning of Liotta's flashback, the psychedelic feel of the end, and the
stunning tracking shot that introduces Liotta and Bracco's first date, but
there are so many postmodern innovations that the viewer is veritably
jarred. With repeated viewings (which have made this film a classic) this
alienation is felt less so, but there is nothing here to challenge
Coppola's
christening scene.<br /><br />Nonetheless, not enough can be said, especially about this movie's acting.
Pesci's star-turn is celebrated, but kudos must also go to the always
underrated Liotta whose subtley suits his role perfectly. De Niro is wasted
but good playing the role he always plays (could he be anything less than
good?) and Paul Sorvino is perfectly understated in a supporting role. The
real praise must go to Lorraine Bracco, the only character to experience a
full spate of emotions. She is the most convincing female character ever in
a gangster film and doesn't have enough scenes, to my taste.<br /><br />The plot - what little there is - weakens the film. The main character's
ambiguous goal is to become a gangster, but this does not drive the film.
Events happen to him, rather than grow out of his own actions making him
difficult to sympathize with. The unsatisfying ending is too quick (as if
Scorsese knew his movie was getting a tab bit overlong) and also
unsatisfying, though he did the latter on purpose as a point of
theme.<br /><br />Overall, a must-see film, though I prefer the better-directed and more
engaging plot of &quot;Casino,&quot; which, unfortunately is often-panned as a
rip-off
of this film. Both film's are ridiculously and violent unlike the early
Hollywood gangster flicks which were juist as - if not more - thematically
effective.
