The Godfather is a pedestrian,slow moving sometimes downright boring
film that doesn&#39;t get anywhere near the level of Goodfellas.This is
Martin Scorcese firing on all cylinders and it is a powerhouse of a
film that gets better with age.The film is translated from a book
called Wiseguys and it really works. The narration by Ray Liotta is
fascinating and keeps things moving constantly.The performances are
also stellar , particularly by Joe Pesci who also won an Oscar for his
turn.Ther are moments of true cinematic magic as De Niro,Liotta and
Pesci act off the screen some of the most compelling performances seen
in the history of the movies. The music is brilliant too and really
adds to proceedings and we hear the 60&#39;s,70&#39;s and 80&#39;s brought to life
by the sounds of the eras.I would say Goodfellas is the finest gangster
film ever made by a long way.It has everything.The Godfather may be
number 1 on IMDb but i &#39;ll take the Pepsi challenge with the two films
any day of the week and twice on Sundays.
