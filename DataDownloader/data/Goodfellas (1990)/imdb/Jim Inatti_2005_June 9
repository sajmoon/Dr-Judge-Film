&quot;as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;The best mob movie ever&quot; that's what Saskel and Ebert say, and i
couldn't be more agree, this is a real masterpiece, and after pulp
fiction my favorite film ever.<br /><br />It's better than the Godfather because the Godfather only show us one
aspect of the mafia, the power of the boss, Goodfellas in the other
hand show us another part of the Mafia, the world in which mafia
members live, their friendships, the betrayals, the way they think and
act.<br /><br />This is the story of Henry Hill, a young man half Irish and half
Italian who always wanted to be a gangster, for him being a gangster is
just the life for him, he always act with his friends Jimmy (Robert De
Niro), and Tommy De Vito Joe Pesci, but he can't be a higher member of
the mafia because he's not completely Italian.<br /><br />This is definitely not only the best Scorsese film, but also a
masterpiece of films of all times, Liotta as Henry Hill did it well,
and of course De Niro was excellent as Jimmy Conway, but the best
performance was Joe Pesci as Tommy De Vito, he definitely deserved the
Oscar he won as best supporting actor. 10/10.
