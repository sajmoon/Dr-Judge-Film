If I was asked to pick the all time best gangster movie this would
definitely be my answer. Martin Scorsesse is the man. Robert DeNiro, Joe
Pesci, Ray Liota do a great job as Italian gangsters. Every moment of this
movie is complete unrealness.<br /><br />Drugs, Guns, all the violence you want in a top quality flick, and a whole
lot of the F word.
