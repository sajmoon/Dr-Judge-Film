Nothing is comparable to the epic of Martin Scorcese. This movie was a
landmark for true crime flicks. Of course The Godfather is a masterpiece
but
it's not a mob movie like Goodfellas. The direction, the music, the
actors... everything is just perfect. The freeze frame sequence are
stunning
just like the raw violence and dialogue played by De Niro and Pesci.
