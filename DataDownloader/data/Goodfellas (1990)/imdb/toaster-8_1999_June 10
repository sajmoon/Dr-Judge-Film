1999_June 10 

This is one of my favourite films, I've seen it dozens of times but I
still
find it hard to watch.  It's so unpleasant, the heroes are ruthless
murderers, Joe Pesci is particularly horrible as the psychopathic Tommy.
Everything about this film is impeccably made, the cinematography is
perfect, the soundtrack is brilliant, the acting superb but I still find
myself hiding during some of the more gruesome moments.  A classic film,
but
not a pleasant one.
