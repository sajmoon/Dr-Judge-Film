My girlfriend (well, ex-girlfriend) told me to be adventurous and rent
this
movie instead of something I knew I would like, like Armageddon.  Boy oh
boy
was she over the rocking chair!  I HATED this movie.  Everybody in this
movie pretends like they're part of a big happy family, but some of these
guys are just plain mean!  They're really just a bunch of jerks-- not
really
'good fellas' at all!<br /><br />I give this a thumbs down.  Way down to Chinatown.  Maybe Scorsese should
just stick to driving taxis!  Ha ha on you!
