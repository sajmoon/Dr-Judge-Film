This is no Godfather. I thought it could have done better if the bonds
between the three main characters were explored more. It has a quite
predictable plot (i feared for everyone's but the main characters' lives
everytime someone raised his voice and argued). I guess i should've watched
this before casino and heat since they work in similar ways, but i didn't so
it was quite repetitive to me. I love Deniro, yet there isn't much of him in
the film. That's too bad.
