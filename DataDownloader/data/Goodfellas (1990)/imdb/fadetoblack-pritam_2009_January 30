Seriously speaking i am very biased towards &#39;Goodfellas&#39; mainly due to
three reasons.Firstly,Robert De Niro is my best actor.Secondly,Martin
Scorceese is my best director and thirdly,according to me this is the
best work of Martin Scorceese till date. Great story,Great acting by
all the three lead actors-De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci,Great
approach towards portraying the characters,Great camera work,Great
Scripting,Great editing and above all Great direction.I have seen this
movie for around 20 times,yet,i don&#39;t feel bored for a single moment
during the movie.I have shown this movie to all my friends and in each
time i have seen it again along with them.It seems that the purpose of
my life is to show this movie to each and every person under the sun.I
simply love this movie. Pity on those who have&#39;nt seen it yet!!!!
