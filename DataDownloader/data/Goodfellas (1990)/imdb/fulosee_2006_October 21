In the movie, to me the people who carried Henry&#39;s mother&#39;s grocery all
the way is not out of respect, but fear. In gang movies such as
Godfather and Goodfellas, they always messed up the concept of respect
and fear. Is that because how the writer wrote the story or the Italian
gangsters are too stupid to identify the difference between respect and
fear? I hardly believe anybody will really &#39;respect&#39; gangster. Did
anyone envy the life of gangster after they watched the movie?
Hopefully somebody can be able to answer my question, and please do not
give me dumb answers such as:&#39;That is how the ways are back to the
days. People did respect the mobs and that&#39;s why they do it. It is
difficult to explain such abstract concept. You might know if you
become one of their members.&#39;
