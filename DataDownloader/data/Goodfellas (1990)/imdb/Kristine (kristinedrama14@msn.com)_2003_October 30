This is one of my top favorite films of all time. Everything about this
movie was excellent. It's hard to choose who gave the best performance in
this movie, because they were all too good. <br /><br />Based on the actual life of Henry Hill, they go through what his life was
like before he ratted out his mob buddies. It's a movie you have to watch to
understand. <br /><br />Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill. A kid who wants nothing more than to become a
member of the mofia. As he does work for one of the bosses, he becomes one
of them. He meets many people along the way. Including his wife, Karen. He
knows when he goes too far, but does what he's told.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro plays Jim Conaway. A respected mobster whose seen it all and
done it all. At first he appears to be a regular &quot;wise guy&quot;, but eventually
ends up loosing it and turns against his friend, Henry.<br /><br />Joe Pecsi plays Tommy DeVito. A big &quot;wise guy&quot; who does things without
thinking. He thinks since he is part of the mofia and %100 Italian that he
can do whatever he wants. He's good to his friends and family. But ends up
paying the price in the end when he messes with a boss.<br /><br />Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill. Henry's wife. She's a woman who doesn't
take any B.S. from anyone. But puts up with Henry's. After all he does to
her, she sticks by his side to the end.<br /><br />And Paul Sorvino plays Paulie. The big boss who controls everything. And
when something goes wrong, he's the one that takes care of
it.<br /><br />Over all, I can't say anymore. Just watch it. It's an excellent
movie.<br /><br />10/10
