I was shocked to see that Goodfellas lost to Dances with the Wolves for best
picture. I am not saying that that movie was bad but i am saying Goodfellas
is a thousand times better than that movie.  All actors are in top form,
Liotta quite possibly gives the best performance of his life, Deniro is just
Deniro and Joe Pesci yea well he got an oscar for it so i can't say anything
else.  The movie revolves around 3 best friends (Liotta, Deniro and Pesci)
who work their way up in the mafia crime organization, thats not just it, it
has liotta's (Henry Hill) personal life involved too, we see steady
character changes and developments as the movie goes on.  The movie is
flawless. I give it 10/10.
