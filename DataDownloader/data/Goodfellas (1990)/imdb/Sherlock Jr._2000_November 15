This movie is what cinema should be. Great story telling, with a perfect
cast. If you've never seen &quot;Goodfellas&quot; prepare to be shot into a reality
not very well known. Like &quot;The Godfather&quot; violence is treated like normal
behavior here. Beating the c**p out of some guy with a gun, isn't really
that out of wack here. Blowing a unarmed kid away for making a smart remark,
although frowned upon, no one really seems to care too much. I'm yet to see
&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (Only 18 yrs old) I must say I liked this film more
than the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; pictures. Watching this shows more of it's
all about if you ask me. Why people want to be a part of this. &quot;The
Godfather&quot; films are about one family. It's about the family biz. This seems
to show why outsiders of &quot;the family&quot; would want to be in it. The power, the
safety, the fear you strike into any single person's heart. For a guy, you
get all the money you can dream of. All the girls you want. And everyone
outside of gangsters, fear you. But it also shows the down side. How fast
everyone will turn on you. All it takes is one mistake and you're a dead
man, and you'll never see it coming. But our lead character, Henry Hill,
unlike most of these guys, uses his brain. I won't really get deep into what
this film gets into. All I know, is that Ray Liotta, had the makings of a
star.  Lorraine Bracco, is beyond perfect as Karen Hill. And the rest of the
cast is right on the mark. Scorsese is as always, so perfect. Even the most
violent of scenes, in his hands looks like poetry. How &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;
won best picture &amp; director (It was a good film, but not that good) I will
never understand. But I think one thing drives people to do this kind of
stuff, &quot;One day kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries
home. You know why? It was outta respect.&quot; Henry was wrong. It was outta
fear. 10 out of 10
