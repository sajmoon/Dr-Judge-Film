Is an excellent film, based on the life of a New York gangster.
Joe pesci (FORGET ABOUT the comic relief he did for a cuppla Lethal Weapon
films), is brilliant and frightening in the role of a wisecracking
psychopath. The subdued performances of Ray liota and De Niro balance
Pescis` role perfectly: It`s almost like they`re scared of
him!
Anyway, even though this review is just a test to see if I can get one in
here, I chose Goodfellas because it`s such a memorable
movie.
