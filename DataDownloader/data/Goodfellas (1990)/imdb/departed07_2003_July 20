&#x22;As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.&#x22;<br /><br />I remember reading Roger Ebert&#x27;s review of &#x22;Gangs of New York&#x22; and
though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how GoodFellas
was a classic in point of direction and of characters. As I recall,
people have mention that &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; is the best crime film ever
made, but I disagree; &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; was a film that showed the
consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not
GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia,
where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those
who were inferior to them.<br /><br />GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by
Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters
hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their
cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all
night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul
Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure
people have heard of him, but he doesn&#x27;t like people watching him and
yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul
and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his
father doesn&#x27;t approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times. But does
that stop him? No.<br /><br />Years later, Henry grows up (Ray Liotta now) and is enjoying what he is
actually doing. He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in
order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid
paychecks.<br /><br />During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not
only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy
&#x22;The Gent&#x22; Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad
guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing.
In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy &#x22;enjoys&#x22; stealing and throughout
the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face,
show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito
(Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but
actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at
a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the
restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell
out of the waiter proving that you can&#x27;t mess with a crew of the mafia,
no matter what the rank is.<br /><br />There&#x27;s another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the
character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with
Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his
dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go
after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the
streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn&#x27;t
what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he&#x27;s in the mob
and fears that she will lose him.<br /><br />A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry
cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of
Jimmy&#x27;s mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.<br /><br />With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that
cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all.
