This movie is the kind you can watch again and again.  The true story of
Henry Hill Italian/Irish gangster.  This movie shows the rise of Henry Hill
in the mob.  From young errand boy to an associate.  The acting is superb,
with the likes of Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci playing the main
three characters.  This movie had a lot of promise and lives up to the hype.
 From the very first live in the movie to the last.  This story grabs you
and doesn't let go. This movie has it all from comedy, Joe Pesci's &quot;whadda
ya mean I'm funny&quot; is classic, to drama.  Watch this movie and there is no
reason it won't be in your top 10.
