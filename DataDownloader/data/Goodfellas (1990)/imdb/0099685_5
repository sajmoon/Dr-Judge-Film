Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always
thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set
a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas
last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just
couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just
simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert
DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and
almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The
camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job
by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high
credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever
made and the song &quot;Layla,&quot; put chills down my spine of how great this
song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my
opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script
that made this, the greatest mob film still today.<br /><br />Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+
