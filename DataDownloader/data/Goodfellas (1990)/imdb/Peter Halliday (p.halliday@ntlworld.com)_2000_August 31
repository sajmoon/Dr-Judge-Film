I've just re-watched Goodfellas for about the 100th time and it was as
fresh
as the first time I saw it.
The characters are so well drawn and the actors so well suited that it
really feels like you know these people.
This is helped by the camera work which is exceptional especially the
steadicam shot into the club, which I have not seen surpassed
since.
Coming from rural England, as I do, I don't know whether this film is a
true
picture of life in the mob but if it isn't, it should be.
