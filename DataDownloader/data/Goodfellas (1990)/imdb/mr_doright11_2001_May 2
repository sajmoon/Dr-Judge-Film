<br /><br />        Wow! This was an excellent flick! It's in my top 5 movies! Everyone
is perfect in this film. Joe Pecsi steals the show, and is at his best in
this movie, in his absolutely off the wall performance as Tommy! As usual,
De Niro is also superb, as the cool gangster Jimmy Conway. Ray Liotta has
never been better. The best gangster film of both the 80's and
90's!<br /><br />         Martin Scorsese has made the best films over the past three
decades, and this is one of them. My only complaint is that it only got one
Oscar, when it should have gotten more (although De Niro did a better job in
Awakenings which was made in the same year, which he should have gotten best
actor), but other wise, this film is a masterpiece!
