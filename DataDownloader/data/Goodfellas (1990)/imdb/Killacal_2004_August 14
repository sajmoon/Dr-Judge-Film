 From the very first scene I was hooked. From start to finish this movie
is a masterpiece.<br /><br />It is the quintessential &quot;modern&quot; gangster movie, but it's much more
than a gangster movie and to call it such doesn't quite do it justice.
It's a movie about friendship and loyalty and how outside elements and
excess can ruin both. It also gives an insight on the life of and inner
workings of the wiseguy network.<br /><br />Lorraine Bracco, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Oscar winner Joe Pesci
all turn in masterful performances and Martin Scorsese is at his best
directing.<br /><br />There isn't a bad performance in the entire movie as a matter of fact.
Each character is developed well and the dialogue is entertaining, yet
authentic.<br /><br />In short this is a movie that lives up to the hype. It is essential for
film buffs, pop culture gurus, and casual movie watchers.<br /><br />10/10
