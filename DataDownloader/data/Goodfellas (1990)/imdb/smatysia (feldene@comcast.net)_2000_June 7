One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous.
Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine
Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came
from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in
the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word,
look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different
from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods,
rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of
the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.<br /><br />NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good. The voiceovers and
music are very loud, and the regular dialogue much too soft. It had me
adjusting the volume throughout. C'mon, guys, for what DVD's cost, you can
do better than that.
