&quot;Goodfellas&quot; in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever made, not
just another mob classic but just an excellent piece of work. Martin
Scorsese really did a great job guiding these already talented actors
to do their best and produce such a great film. The actors did Oscar
worthy performances, each playing the parts of a mob story based on
real events. With Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, Jimmy Conway played
by Robert De Niro, Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, Paul Cicero played
by Paul Sorvino and Karen Hill played by Lorraine Bracco under the
direction of Martin Scorsese, what more can you expect? The story of a
young Italian/Irish American working his way through the levels of La
Costa Nostra (the mob) is brought to life in this spectacular film. If
you never seen this you should, whether your a mob movie fan, action,
comedy, drama or especially a mixture of these, this is the film for
you. 10/10 stars, 5/5 stars.
