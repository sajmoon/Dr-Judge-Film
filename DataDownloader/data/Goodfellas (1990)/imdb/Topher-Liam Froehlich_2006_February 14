Goodfellas <br /><br />Good film? Sorry I paraphrased. I meant to say what an awesomely
terrific film, boasting sharp acting, directing, writing, and all
around one of Scorcese's best, and of of THE BEST films(ever).<br /><br />The film is a great insight into mob life (it was based on a book by a
mobster). From Ray Liotta's note-perfect narration, to the detail
accounts of how things run, whether its correct or not, the film is
brilliantly orchestrated. Does it really have a plot? No, it more or
less follows three gangsters for several decades, charting their rise
and fall. Does that matter? Absolutely not.<br /><br />WPacked with a jazzy soundtrack, nicely done costumes and sets, the
atmosphere for the film is set.<br /><br />The actors are all absolutely correct. Robert Deniro, though his role
be brief, is great as Jimmy Conway. He is completely convincing, as
always. Joe Pesci is hate-ably awesome, as slightly insane Tommy.
Sometimes he's funny, sometimes he's crazy, angry, or sometimes he's
all of them. And he can even move from one to the other smoothly, and
believably. The work of a great actor. Lorraine Braco is also great
support as Henry Hill's wife, frustrated with her husband and the life
he has, but also kind of enjoying it. Ray Liotta is underrated, giving
a perfect performance as Henry Hill. From his great narration to
charming innocence (seemingly) to the guy filled with a rage within.<br /><br />Marty's direction is fantastic. He doesn't glorify the mob in telling
their story, rather he shows how they can fall apart as they succumb to
the greed of money and drugs. The long shots are cool, and despite no
plot and three hours, the movie keeps moving without boring. And there
are intense images delivered powerfully too; the opening with a man
being brutally stabbed in the trunk, to a sixteen year-old Henry
blowing up cars and then proclaiming as the camera freezes &quot;One day the
kids in the neighborhood helped my mother carry her groceries home. You
know why? It was outta respect&quot; <br /><br />The film is great, beginning to end. And it even manages to be darkly
funny at points. 10/10.<br /><br />&quot;If another letter goes to that kids house, you going in the oven
headfirst&quot;-Goodfellas
