yes its true the godfather is #1, but I feel that goodfellas is
completely over looked in this aspect. I mean if you actually sit down
and watch this film; shot by shot, frame by frame, you can clearly see
that goodfellas is the perfect rival for the #1 spot. From the
beginning of the film you see henry hill trying to get in, and at the
same time you as the viewer want in as well to this comfy, looked after
environment, where you know you are loved and welcomed always. . . as
long as you bust your butt. The film keeps you there for so long, until
a certain point where you see the drugs and random hits take over the
mafia world, bosses taking on bosses, wars. As the film comes to its
close, like henry is trying to get out you want out of this world as
well, because it is'nt what it once was. You see the godfather never
made you feel like you wanted out, the family unit aspect was so tight,
Mario puza could'nt have written that story any better, and coppola
just knew what to do. The question is in goodfellas was the highest
high worth the lowest low, and did it make you feel more comfortable
than the family environment in the godfather, well thats up to you as
the viewer to decide. I still think that goodfellas is the definitive
rival for the #1 contenders spot.
