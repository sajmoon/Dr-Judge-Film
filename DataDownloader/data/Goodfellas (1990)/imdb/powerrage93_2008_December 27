Goodfellas is the definition of a great film. I bought Goodfellas a few
weeks ago and I was blown away. The Plot: the plot was just amazing. It
was interesting and it keeps you on the edge your seat every second.
The Acting: Now this was really the main point of the movie. Robert De
Niro gives his best performance and Jimmy Conway. De Niro keeps the
film fresh and exciting. Joe Pesci was a real shocker too. Pesci&#39;s role
as the crazy little gangster was so amazing. He may be the bad guy but
you just end up liking him. Ray Liotta was the main man. His acting was
perfect in every way. He really made Henry Hill come to life. The
Director: Martin Scorsese Scorsese was directing it. Scorsese = classic
Overall Goodfellas is really a film to have.
