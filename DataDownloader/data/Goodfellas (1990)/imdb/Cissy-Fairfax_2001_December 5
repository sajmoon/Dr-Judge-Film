2001_December 5 

If I had my way, this is the film that all gangster &amp; violence films should
be measured up against. It sets all the standards which some films have
since lived up to but most have failed miserably.<br /><br />Dare I say it, it's better than Godfather 1 &amp; probably even part 2, and that
takes some doing.<br /><br />The main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount
of characters. Even Godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably
has just one or two extra Italians to confuse you slightly.<br /><br />This is gangster films &amp; even films generally, at it's
best.<br /><br />Sure there's some gruesome &amp; heartless scenes, and I felt for the innocent
postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create
exactly the mood.<br /><br />Of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can
easily believe. If only others in the film industry would try to do
likewise.<br /><br />9.5/10 if such a vote existed, it doesn't so 10/10. <br /><br />Alongside only Star Wars, Great Escape, Shawshank Redemption &amp; the
Magnificent 7 out of 300 films. That's pretty good company.
