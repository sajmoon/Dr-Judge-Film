20 years ago Marty Scorsese put out a movie that was so entertaining,
so full of great dialogue that we&#x27;ve(at least I have) been quoting it
ever since.<br /><br />The fact that your probably never get another Deniro, Pesci, Scorsese
collaboration again is enough of a reason to worship this work. The
rapid cuts, the great crazy camera movement and the fact that soooo
many actors were in this movie for small parts(i.e. see Tobin Bell and
Samuel L. Motherf*****ing Jackson in the credits.)makes for, you
guessed it, awesomeness.<br /><br />Goodfellas is one of the only films I can watch repeatedly without
getting bored. Maybe I&#x27;m a fanatic. And maybe I&#x27;m just obsessed. And
just maybe your taste sucks if you don&#x27;t love Goodfellas. Frankly there
hasn&#x27;t been a piece of cinema that compares in my book. That&#x27;s right, I
said it. If you got a problem you can go talk to Tommy about it.
