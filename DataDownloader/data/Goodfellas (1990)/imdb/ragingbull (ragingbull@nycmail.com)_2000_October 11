This is a great movie. Perfect writing, directing, acting and
cinematography. It appeals to all types of film viewers, the serious scholar
or the 15 year-old kid. Every scene is just right, the movie is perfect just
the way it is. There are many memorable scenes and dialogue too. Any great
cinematic examples a movie should follow, GoodFellas contains all the best.
A truly different sort of epic. Won an Academy Award for Joe Pesci in his
Best Supporting Actor role. Film was also nominated for Best Picture (which
I feel should of won over Dances With Wolves), Directing, Editing,
Screenplay and Supporting Actress (Lorraine Bracco). 4/4
