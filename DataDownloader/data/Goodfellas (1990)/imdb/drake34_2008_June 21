&#39;Goodfellas&#39; blazes a path for other films to follow. This 1990 crime
drama directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the book &#39;Wiseguy&#39; by
Nicholas Pileggi, tells the true story of Henry Hill. The film follows
the rise and fall of three gangsters, spanning three decades. In my
opinion, I believe Martin Scorsese&#39;s finest work to date. When I am at
home, flipping through the channels, there are only a few select
repeats that I could not pass up. &#39;Goodfellas&#39; is one of them. There is
simply no other movie that covers the gangster underworld in a more fun
and interesting way. When there is a young director working very hard
on a film, deep down they are aspiring to accomplish what this film
brings to the table. &#39;Goodfellas&#39; elicits every human aspect of life:
there is laughter, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness, and violence.
Although these guys were not the nicest of people, Scorsese somehow or
another&#133;gets the viewer to not only identify with the characters, but
understand them, and ultimately to like them. The score,
cinematography, editing, and performances will never be duplicated.
&#39;Goodfellas&#39; will remain as one of the finest films ever made. Martin
Scorsese is a living legend whose attention to detail sets the bar so
high for young filmmakers, it may seem impossible and simply
unattainable. This film is a brilliant classic that will be ranked in
everyone&#39;s top ten for decades to come. Drake Dietrick
