There&#x27;s no doubt that The Godfather is one of the greatest movies ever
made, but while The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,
Goodfellas is fantastic and extraordinary! In my honest to goodness
point of view, Goodfellas is the best movie ever made about modern
crime! I mean that despite the f-word being used countless times, this
movie is an extremely spectacular marvelous marvel of a film! In my
opinion, this movie is one of the best movies of the decade of
1990-1999, and not only that, but it is also one of the best movies of
the year of 1990! This movie was not what I was expecting it to be, I
knew that it was going to be a great movie, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to
be as great as it turned out to be! I mean that I was totally and
completely shocked at how fabulous this film was, and that is not a
joke at all, this movie was totally and completely fabulous from start
to finish! In the end, I decided that this would be another one of the
greatest movies that I have ever seen in my life, and that is saying a
lot, because I have seen a lot of great movies in my life!<br /><br />Along with the overall fabulous results, this movie has also got some
very fabulous acting from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who won an extremely
well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and especially
from Robert De Niro! Robert De Niro in my opinion was the best part of
the movie, he was a scene stealer, or even better, he pretty much owned
the entire movie! Whenever he character was on screen, I had my eyes
fixed on him, not anybody else. This film is not as good as The
Godfather, well what is? Well though The Godfather is a better movie,
Goodfellas is still an extraordinary movie that is timeless!<br /><br />Well let me say one last thing here, if you haven&#x27;t seen this movie
yet, then you should see it! Why? Because you are going to be thrilled
with this movie! I don&#x27;t care what you say, you are going to be totally
and completely thrilled with the fabulous results! While The Godfather
is the best gangster film ever made, this movie is honestly the best
movie about modern day crime ever made. So all in all, Goodfellas is a
simply delightful and remarkable movie, the results are something to
see!<br /><br />10/10
