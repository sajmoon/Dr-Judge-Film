I had not seen this movie until my son bought it for Christmas 2001. I
don't
know why I missed it in the theater but I sure am glad I have my own copy
now. This movie is one of the best mobster movies I have ever seen. The
acting in this movie is superb. Ray Liotta's portrayal of mobster Henry
Hill
is dead on perfect as are the performances of Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro,
Paul
Sorvino and others.<br /><br />The use of voice overs in this movie ties the scenes together just right.
And the soundtrack does what its supposed to do, get your emotions
involved.
Especially in the case of the helicopter chase scenes. Anyone who has
studied film and film music knows this.<br /><br />The scene in which the character of Tony played by Joe Pesci gets
&quot;made&quot;
is one of the most startling that I have ever seen.<br /><br />As for a rating for this film I give it Five stars out of
five.
