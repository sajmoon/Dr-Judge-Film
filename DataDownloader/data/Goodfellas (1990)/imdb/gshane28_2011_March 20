its is a great movie with such an insight in to the mob life.it is by
far Scorsese masterpiece of his career and probably the best mob movie
ever. it is only 2hrs and 20 minutes long and it follows henry hill and
his rise up the mob hierarchy.the acting in the movie is great it stars
Ray Liotta,Robert De Niro and,Joe Pesci.they all play there part in the
film to prefection.but Joe pesci absolutely steals the show as tommy DE
Vito.he fully deserved the recognition he got and totally deserved the
Oscar.it was the highlight of his career. i would totally recommend
everyone check this film out you will not be disappointed at all<br /><br />10/10 Greatest mob movie ever along with the godfather of course
