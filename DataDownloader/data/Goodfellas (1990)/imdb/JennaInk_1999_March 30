1999_March 30 

This movie is undoubtably one of my three favorite movies of all time. It
is
the best crime story to ever hit the silver screen. Maybe it's just an
Italian thing DeNiro, Liotta, Pesci, Sorvino, and Bracco, perfect casting
but no ones ever seemed to grasp the truth of the mafia like Scorsese. A
must see for anyone! Simply a TEN.
