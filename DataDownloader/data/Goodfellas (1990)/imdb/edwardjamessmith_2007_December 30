Martin Scorsese is just quite simply one of the influenced film-makers
in the business. All his films are done with style and character.
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990) is a film which felt so realistic (it&#39;s based on a
true story) and the way it was put together just looked impossible
(with the editing,the dialog voice-overs, the angles, the setting,
etc...) but that&#39;s what film-making is all about: making the impossible
possible on the big screen and Scorsese did that and he succeeded. I
can now see where Quentin Tarantino came from with his influences which
I find fascinating. Goodfellas, in my opinion is better than the
Godfather films and any other rip-offs. I just don&#39;t understand why
this film didn&#39;t win best film of 1990 (&quot;Dances with wolves&quot;, what were
they thinking!). It was because of the violence and the ironic thing is
that&#39;s what the film&#39;s about: a life of violence in the mafia and all
the film is doing is trying to show how violence is in reality (which
is very important). Goodfellas is by far the greatest gangster film
ever made in a long time and it&#39;s martin scorsese&#39;s best film along
with 1976&#39;s Taxi Driver (the film that showed how an individual can be
just be a complete nutter). Another great film which has won its place
in my 100 greatest films of all time. 10/10
