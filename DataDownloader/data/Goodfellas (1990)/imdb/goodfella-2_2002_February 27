Now that the '90s have passed it can be said.  This is the best movie of
the
decade.  Also, now that the 1900's are &quot;gone&quot; (and there was nothing we
could do about it), it can be said - top 5 of all time! The way the movie
captures the lifestyle is perfect. This movie has 2 of the most memorable
scenes (Shinebox, Funny How)ever.
