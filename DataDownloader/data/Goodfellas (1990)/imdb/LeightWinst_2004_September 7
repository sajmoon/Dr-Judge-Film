2004_September 7 

I purchased what I consider to be my first choice as THE best film of
all time on DVD recently and it got me thinking about a thought I had
years ago. This is the most technically perfect film you will see.Okay,
the editing has no consistency in parts,but that highlights the almost
documentary feel to it. It is perfectly cast, brilliantly scripted,
sublimly edited(by the genius Thelma Schoonmaker)and has a soundtrack
most people can only dream of thinking of.<br /><br />I seriously think, and have done for years before seeing the extras on
the new DVD, that if your a new filmmaker, or at least want to make a
film, there is a blueprint here to follow.Close ups,freeze frame, LONG
tracking shots,spitfire editing,all in all, complete. Hell Frank
Darabont says he watched this film every Sunday he made &quot;The Shawshank
Redemption&quot;. And that's from the director of one of the most well
thought of movies on this database.<br /><br />This one day will be recognised as THE definitive gangster movie,it is
certainly the equal of The Godfather,perhaps not as sumptuos,but none
the less it's equal and peer.It set a benchmark, but Marty improved it.<br /><br />Holy s*** did he.<br /><br />Be nice to yourself,perhaps one day you'll want to grow up to be a
gangster..........
