1999_April 30 

Goodfellas is by far the best movie ever made! Every performance is
perfect,
the story is complex enough to where you can watch it a few times before
you
get the whole picture, but not so labyrinthine that you can't follow the
movie the first time.  The soundtrack is an excellent selection of music
representing different time periods.  It brings you into Henry Hill's
infatuation with Karen, as well as his infatuation with drugs.  I LOOOOOVE
this movie.
