What this film did was bring into the mainstream a life that was always
rumoured about. The Godfather probably accurately depicted &quot;the old
firm&quot;, while Goodfellas showed us the life in a more contemporary
light.<br /><br />It is a great film. A life&#39;s tale of not only one man, but the Mafia as
we may or may not know it today. It was Sopranos before that show ever
got conceived. Plus the Sopranos just borrowed all their actors! <br /><br />This film has everything, depicting a time that our grandparents
discuss with a tear of happiness. It is a great example of what makes
us love the anti-hero, something mafia films always make us do. The
characters are funny, ruthless, intimidating and I feel
non-stereotypical...
