Casino and this tie for second best Scorsese movies. I overeacted in saying
that casino is better than goodfellas but they are equally great films.
Casino does have similarities too goodfellas and that is Casino's only
weakness. But a reason for the similarities are  cause there adapted
screenplays from books by the same author so there will be some similarities
between them.<br /><br />Goodfellas is filled with great performances in it. Robert De Niro is solid
in his role. Joe Pesci was excellent, he scares me. Lorraine Braccos
performance was overrated. Ray Liotta was kind of weak compared to De Niro
and Pesci.<br /><br />Scorsese should have won for Best director and the movie should have won
Best Picture. 10 out of 10.
