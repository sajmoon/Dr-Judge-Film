I must have seen this film more than ten times. I always enjoy it.
However after watching Goodfellas tonight, I don&#x27;t really consider it
the &#x22;great film&#x22; I always believed it to be.<br /><br />It&#x27;s still an enjoyable film, the dialogue is excellent (some of which
I quote daily), it&#x27;s photographed beautifully, all the actors do their
jobs wonderfully (Joe Pesci is crazy lol), but when all is said and
done, I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve really learnt very much. There is no real
character development, nothing to really sink your teeth into, just
about enough to show you the lifestyles of the gangsters.<br /><br />Goodfellas is an entertaining way to spend 150 minutes if you want to
laugh at the things gangsters get up to in New York, but if you want a
character study on members of organised crime, watch The Sopranos.
