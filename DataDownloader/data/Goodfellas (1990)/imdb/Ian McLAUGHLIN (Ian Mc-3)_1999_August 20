The Godfather may have told an interesting story of one family's hold on the
mafia but nothing can touch the brilliance of Goodfellas. De Niro brought a
surreal acceptance to his role that made him &quot;a made man!&quot; and Joe Peschi
just stole every scene with his motor mouth, (and people thought Eddie
Murphy used the &quot;F&quot; word alot!) which cracked me up throughout!<br /><br />I don't know what it is about him but PESCHI's tough guy talk makes me laugh
and I have looked forward to his performances in everything since this
classic introduced him to me.<br /><br />10/10.
