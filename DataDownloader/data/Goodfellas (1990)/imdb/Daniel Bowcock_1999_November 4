Joe Pesci's incredibly terrifying psychopath.Tommy De Vitos relentless
intimidation elevated pub quotation games to new heights.Scorsese's
Goodfellas is possibly the finest gangster movie ever made. Liotta puts
across just enough charm to make him the anti-hero for the early 90's. De
Niro gives one of the most menacing performances of his career, and Lorraine
Bracco wonderfully contradicts the downtrodden, housebound view of the
gangsters moll that we have come to accept, her vendetta against her
husbands girlfriend a joy. The steadicam shot is often regarded as the high
point of the movie, but for its entire two-and-a-half-hour running time,
moments like that come along all the time, the whole film a visual feast.
The trick with Goodfellas is its searing honesty, Scorsese shys away from
nothing, showing graphic violence in all of its beautiful brutality, and
switching the upbeat, often lighthearted first half of the movie with the
coke-induced paranoia of the second act is masterfully done. The dialogue is
superb, supplying film buffs with line after line to quote to unenlightened
friends and relatives, and,just in case you wanted to know-the &quot;F&quot; word is
used 246 times.
