One of the best films ever made. I think Scorsese&#39;s famous rule
breaking really payed of. The fluidness of the camera, the lighting,
the swish pans up, the zoomed in, the double zoom. It&#39;s all very good
and it just shows us how talented Scorsese really is. The cast is
superb, De Niro, Peci, Liotta and Bracco. The film brings a vibrant
feel to it and the soundtrack is very good for the films era. Sperb
editing from Thelma Schoonmaker who is a big supporter for Marty. I
think all of Scorsese&#39;s films are fantastic and his camera work is
unusual and different. We should have more Scorsese like directors
about, the film itself is priceless, a masterpiece.
