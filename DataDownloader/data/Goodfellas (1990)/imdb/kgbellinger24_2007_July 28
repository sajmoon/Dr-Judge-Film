After seeing all the Godfathers, knock off mob movies on TV, the
departed etc. I turned to Goodfellas. This movie had phenomenal acting
and i loved how it connected to actual people rather than fictional
ones. However, the direction and pacing is what detracted this movie&#39;s
overall appeal. It was too slow in some parts and it seemed the movie
had no sense of direction in some parts, which made me uninterested. <br /><br />Joe Pesci, got under my thick skin, which proves how well he lived this
character. He wasn&#39;t acting. Some of his scenes I will never forget.
Liotta also proved to me he is an actor of high caliber. It was also
interesting to see De Niro in a supporting role than the lead. <br /><br />I think this movie is tad-bit overrated, especially for its direction.
Scorcesse has yet to really impress me, though i enjoyed departed. Good
portrayal of the mobs underbelly but it seemed like i ve seen this
movie before. It was seemed like deja vu almost.
