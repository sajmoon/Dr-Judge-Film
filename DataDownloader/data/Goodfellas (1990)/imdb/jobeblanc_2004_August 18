Telling a great story means telling it vividly but without excess.  In a
film this means the development of characters appropriate to importance,
including the important details and not omitting the important details.  It
means vibrant energy, without distraction caused by egotistical digression
of writer, director or actor.<br /><br />Goodfellas doesn't tell a story of epic merit, but it does tell a damned
good story - and it tells it so appropriately well, that the audience is
absorbed into a world that is surreal but engrossing and
credible.<br /><br />This film is a classic because it is doesn't fail any of the rules of fine
movie construction - it exceeds them all.  The viewer is carried, even swept
away with the poignant but tranquil first-person narration (similar to &quot;The
Drug Store Cowboy&quot;) in the sea of action, great moments, and big
characters.<br /><br />Certainly this is a a must-see for serious film lovers.<br /><br />
