I do believe the title says it all. This film mixes gritty reality with
every guy&#39;s fantasy of wealth, women, and power. And just when it looks
like life can&#39;t get any better for these rich powerful men, Scorsese
reminds us that this is the real world and there&#39;s a price to be paid
for excess and criminality.<br /><br />I have watched this movie more than I have any other (I average about
two viewings per month) and I will never grow tired of it.<br /><br />And anyone who wants to argue that &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a better mob
movie, let me point out to you that movie is about a family and the
American Dream which uses mob life as a backdrop. The mob story is not
the spine of the film. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a straight up mob movie.
