Absorbing, pumped-up tale&#x97;based on real life incidents&#x97;of an ambitious
young man who grows up in the mafia-ridden neighborhood of Brooklyn,
New York. His parents have high expectations for him, but unfortunately
for them his only goal in life is to become a member of the mob. From
the moment the film starts it grabs and holds you with its riveting
story, dark humor, memorable characters, colorful dialogue,
over-the-top performances, and potent violence. Every member of the
cast is superb, and Pesci is a real scene stealer. Runs around in the
later half and loses some of its impact, but overall a gripping,
authentic, and startling look at life among mobsters. Unforgettable and
really a must-see. ****
