I absolutely loved this film, the stunning troika of De niro, Pesci and
Liotta was amazing and I class this film as one of the best I have ever
seen. I found this film to be by far the best &quot;Mob&quot; film made in the
history of films, (Godfather /II) both come a close second but this
film is superb. The direction of Scorsese is excellent and shows an
intamate knowledge of the terrain that he is filming, and the amazing
soundtrack!!! I am only 20 years old and the soundtrack, used in this
context is brilliant!! If you have never seen this film watch it, you
will be watching an absolute classic!! <br /><br />&quot;Look, you brought her here, and that means that you're giving her the
shot. The day that I bring an OD-ing bitch over to your house, then
I'll give her the shot. Giver her the shot!&quot;
