This speed, fluency, and general style of this film make it seem to last one
hour rather than three. The one shot scene when Henry enters the club with
his date via the kitchen is quite simply breathtaking. Another thing, has
anyone noticed the amount of scenes that involve food? It is unwise to watch
this film while hungry.
