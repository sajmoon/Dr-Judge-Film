Maybe I was so disappointed in this movie because I&#39;d already seen the
Godfathers and the Sopranos, but this movie couldn&#39;t have disappointed
me more.<br /><br />I don&#39;t even know where to begin. The plot was dull and predictable. I
realize it is based on a true story, but it was still boring.<br /><br />For the caliber of actors in it, I wasn&#39;t moved by any of the
performances.<br /><br />The pace was choppy. The final half hour felt like an entirely
different film.<br /><br />Very disappointing mob saga and one of the most overrated film of all
time.
