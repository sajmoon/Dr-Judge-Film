As always Scorcese manages to make a very &quot;artistic&quot; movie unlike all
other
directors. Like in the later movie &quot;Casino&quot; he let the leading actors tell
the story while the pictures roll on and it is first in the later part of
the movie he revolves and take up the &quot;normal&quot; movie-style with dialogue.
I
think that this is a perfect way of making a movie interesting but perhaps
it is getting a little too used by Scorcece, because all of the movies I
have
seen of him, not so many, is made this way. De Niro and Pesci shows how
perfect they are at acting together in a &quot;Mafia-movie&quot; and this is one of
the better they made together - Casino is still my favorite. I especially
like the way Pesci is acting, he is just perfect at being a crazy killer
that don't take no for an answer. So I hope to see more Scorcece movies
starring De Niro and Pesci, but lets make it in an other - but still
unusual
way Scorcese.
