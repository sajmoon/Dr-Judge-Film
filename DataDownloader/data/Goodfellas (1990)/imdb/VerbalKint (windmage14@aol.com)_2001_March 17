I'm going to cut to the chase:  If you like movies, if you really like
crime
movies, and if you want an awesome movie... See this.  I mostly rent, but
this is one of the few movies I went out of my way to purchase.  Watching
this is amazing.  You root for the bad guys, since the main characters are
&quot;bad guys&quot;.  You see the difficulties they encounter, and the decisions
they
make.  This is perfect.  Thank you for this movie...
