1998_November 6 

Based on a true story.  I drove a truck (younger years) daily through
Idelwild Airport before it was renamed JFK Airport.  Rest assured - the mob
ruled.  Forget the goofs, this was real life in the late 50's, early 60's.
I also had conversation with Henry Hill in a cocktail lounge in Manhattan
(New York City) in the 80's.  This flick works!
