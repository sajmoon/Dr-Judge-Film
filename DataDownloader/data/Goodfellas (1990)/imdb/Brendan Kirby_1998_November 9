1998_November 9 

As Howard Stern says, &quot;There's not a thing wrong with this
film.&quot;
One scene melts into the next, obscuring its length. It blows by, and
before you know it, it's over. The acting, directing and cinematography are
all superior.
In measure of the acting quality, DeNiro doesn't even give the most
memorable performance.
The film is wonderfully constructed. I love the middle-is-beginning
motif.
The movie has some of the funniest, most powerful, most memorable scenes in
film history.
In short, this film blows you away.
