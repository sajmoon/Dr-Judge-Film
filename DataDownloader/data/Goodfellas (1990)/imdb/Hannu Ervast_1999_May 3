1999_May 3 

Great movie, what can I say. Got 9/10 from me.
Smooth directing and plot. Joe Pesci Is great, somebody could have
nightmares from him, he sure can act quite menacing. Liottas best Role
(ever
?) De Niro great as usual, other actors way over average. These kind of
movies come only 10 in a Century !
