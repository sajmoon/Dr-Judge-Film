When I was little I watched Goodfeathers. Little did I realize that it
was based on Goodfellas.Bobby was Robert Di Niro. Squit was Ray Liotta,
the narrator. Pesto was Joe Pesci.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the movie was when Ray Liotta told Joe Pesci he
was funny. I love when Pesci asks, &#x22;You think I&#x27;m funny like a clown?
Do I amuse you?&#x22;, pretending to confront him and laughing when he
becomes increasingly nervous.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Robert Di Niro&#x27;s performances as Liotta&#x27;s mob boss.
There are a lot of violent scenes, and always the threat of violence in
everyone&#x27;s words, but it isn&#x27;t gratuitous. I love when they cook food
in prison, having even their incarceration found ways to maintain their
brotherhood and lifestyle. I don&#x27;t like the scene when Liotta and his
wife were followed by a an FBI helicopter, indicating the end of their
freedom. As criminal and self destructive as their lifestyle was, it
was difficult not to feel for them. &#x27;Guess we always love the bad guys.
