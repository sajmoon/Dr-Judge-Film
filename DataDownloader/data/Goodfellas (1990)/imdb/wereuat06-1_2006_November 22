This is Martin Scorsese&#39;s greatest movie ever played on screen. Of
course it is often compared to Raging Bull which is also another great
cinematic masterpiece but no where close to Good Fellas which is the
definitive mobster movie of the 90s and all time. Robert DeNiro gives
off his greatest performance but we shouldn&#39;t put all our eyes on
DeNiro as Ray Liotta is the king of this movie showing what its like to
become a mobster and go through changes and how you don&#39;t just turn to
a man but inside you change. It is perfect in story wise. But lets not
forget about Pesci where could it be without Pesci the hard headed
mobster who never wants to be punked around. All around this was a
great achievement and in my books is one of the greatest movies ever
told on screen.10 out 10.
