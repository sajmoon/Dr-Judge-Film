1999_April 19 

Hey all-<br /><br />I find that most times that I see a film, I always want to tweak some
part of it to make it &quot;just right&quot;. There isn't one thing that I'd like to
change about this film.
I am disappointed that Ray Liotta's career has completely disintegrated
after his amazing performance in this film. I never gave him a second
thought until I rented this film about 9 months ago.
Don't miss it!!!
