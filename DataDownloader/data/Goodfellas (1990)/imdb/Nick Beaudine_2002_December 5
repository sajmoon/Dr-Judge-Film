After I watched this the first time, I just had to see it again. So I
did.
And then I did again.This is one of director Martin Scorsese's  right
here.  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull&quot; are right at the top of my, too.
Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Paul
Sorvino, and the rest of the cast are all in top form.  It is told in an
excellent style of storytelling.  It also has a great soundtrack, even
though I am a big fan of rock music.  Check out &quot;Casino&quot; when you
are done watching this movie.  It's the same style, but it's way
longer.
