Goodfellas, one of the best movies of the 90s (Which deserves its title) has
what every good gangster picture should have. It is not as good as the  
Godfather, but damn it's close.<br /><br />It has violence. I really don't think I need to point out when the movie is
violent. Watch the whole movie.<br /><br />It has comedy. It's not really funny, but Joe Pesci (At his very best) gives
a sense of sharp humor. A very well deserved Best Supporting
Actor.<br /><br />Drama. It's really the main subject of the movie (I'm talking about Comedy,
Drama, Action, Thriller, etc.) so like violence there's no need to  point it
out.<br /><br />Not only do we have all that, we have an incredibly believeable gangster
story. Robert De Niro, who is great as usual, Ray Liotta (Why wasn't he
nominated for Best Actor? He was outstanding), Paul Sorvino (An underrated
actor, who also does great), Joe Pesci (Best performance in the movie. ..who I thought was great to watch), and Lorraine Bracco (From the Sopranos,
this is somewhat similar to what she does on TV, and she still is great).
This is probably Martin Scorsese's best directed movie next to Taxi Driver.
And every single minute of this movie is completely believable. Dances with
Wolves was great, but this movie really did deserve to win Best Picture.
10/10
