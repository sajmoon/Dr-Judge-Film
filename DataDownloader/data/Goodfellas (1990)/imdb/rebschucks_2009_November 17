I think this is actually an amazing film, and I&#x27;m surprised &#x22;Dances
With Wolves&#x22; beat it out in the Academy Awards. It&#x27;s raw, it&#x27;s dark,
and it stays with you long after you&#x27;ve seen it. I can certainly
appreciate the movie for being quite possibly the most accurate mob
movie in movie history. Nothing here is romanticized. They may have had
a lot of perks, made a lot of money, but at what cost? That is
ultimately the theme that is explored in &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;<br /><br />However it is most definitely NOT for everyone. There is no justice, no
happy ending, sometimes no rhyme of reason for the crimes that are
committed, except that it&#x27;s just the way of life. The people in the
movie are not sympathetic, you won&#x27;t like them. You won&#x27;t like their
friends. You won&#x27;t like their enemies. For some people that can be
frustrating, myself included. It&#x27;s disturbing; some of the murders in
this movie made me downright angry. It took me about 3 viewings before
I could watch the film in it&#x27;s entirety. <br /><br />So my advice would be to definitely go see this movie if you think you
can stomach it. But be warned: You might be pushed to your limit.
