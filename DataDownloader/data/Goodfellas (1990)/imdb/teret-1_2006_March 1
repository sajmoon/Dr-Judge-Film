I can't stop watching this film!My Grandson and I started it in
November,and we've been &quot;On A Run&quot;,ever since!Scorsese at his best!The
music alone is worth it!What a Great Movie!I've got 3 Tapes of this
,just to make sure I always have it!Bought another(commercial
version)the other day!Also was on TV last night.watched it again!That's
twice in two days!This Flicks' ,for Me!I first saw it on TV years ago
too!My other favorites,right up there with this movie are &quot;Bronx Tale&quot;
,Mad Dog and Glory,Sopranos.Ray Liotta has become a favorite actor for
me,even in &quot;Non-&quot;Mobster&quot; roles!Of course Robert Deniro is a &quot;Gimmee&quot;
in parlance,of the &quot;Mobster aficionado's!
