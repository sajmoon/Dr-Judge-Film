Goodfellas is one of those films that gets better every time you watch it. 
The story has been well documented, but what works for me is the superb
soundtrack that accompanies most scenes, the incredible and intense acting,
the amazing script, the clothes and the fact that the story is fast moving -
there are no long drawn out scenes.  Robert De Niro must go down as one of
the all time greats - he can steal a scene without actually saying a word. 
I could go on for years about this film - as it has been a big part of my
life.  For all of you that have yet to watch Goodfellas - go and buy it
now.
