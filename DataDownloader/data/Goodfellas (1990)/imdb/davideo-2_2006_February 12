STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little
Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of
Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s Italy,
who is in awe of the wiseguys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the
respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive
father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and
we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the
crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before
going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone
wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts
taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify
against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they
put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.<br /><br />Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you
wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles
in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form
but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals
the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.<br /><br />Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of
the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still
shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are
usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with
some real lingering melodies from that era.<br /><br />The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how
the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very
similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to
families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just
why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most
forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll
have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly
as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it
all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed,
as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though
we've known these characters for years.<br /><br />Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of
all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will
rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if
you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****
