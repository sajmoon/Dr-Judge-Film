One of the best films ever made revolving around a bunch of mobsters
(aka -wise-guys). A film of this calibre is hard to sum up in such few
words. Where to even begin? It&#x27;s a fantastic story-line (based on a
true story), has amazing acting, De Niro and Pesci give awesome
performances and really work fantastically well together. It has one of
the best directors of all time in Scorcese, who is the master in this
genre. Put these all together and you have yourself an awesome flick.
It&#x27;s fast paced, incredibly smart, funny yet gritty. If you enjoy hard
hitting gangster films you&#x27;ll be glued to the screen and are sure to
relish it! I&#x27;ve watched it several times and never tire of it!<br /><br />&#x22;I go from Rags To Riches&#x22;
