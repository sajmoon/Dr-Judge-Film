looks like everyone has had their say, but let me add the scene where
they are all eating, the itallian sasauges and meats being passed
around, god that always makes me so hungry<br /><br />one problem is the movie makes you want to be a mobster, in the end you
die a quick death or you get rich or protected for doing no real work.
Most of the time your enjoying life and upper society.<br /><br />the victims of what these gangs have done, especially the pollution of
drugs into our country, will be what is and has lead to our downfall.
With most of the taliban&#x27;s money coming from opium trade and while they
deal with coke in this movie the guys they speak of have their hands in
any drug that will make money. <br /><br />Heroin takes a person and makes them have to have herion to even try to
be a good person. There guys are made into idols and hero&#x27;s while our
forefathers idolized the men who captured these men.
