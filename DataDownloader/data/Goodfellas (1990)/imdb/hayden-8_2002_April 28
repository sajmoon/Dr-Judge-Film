The true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster working his way up the
mob hierarchy, this is a sensational, brilliantly acted film, which, I
suspect, presents a more realistic picture of the mafia than &quot;The
Godfather&quot;, and that is in no way a criticism of that film.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese peoples his films with some of the most fascinating
and repellent characters you never want to meet. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is no
exception. It has just about everything going for it, including a terrific
soundtrack (catch Sid Vicious' manic &quot;My way&quot; at the end of the film).
Perhaps most importantly, at a time when most films seem to be suffering
from overlength, there is not a wasted or boring moment in the film's two
and a half hour running time.<br /><br />My only question is: when is Scorsese ever going to win the
Oscar?
