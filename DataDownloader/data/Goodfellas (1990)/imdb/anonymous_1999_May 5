1999_May 5 

I have seen this movie over a million times.  Every time that I watch it,
I
try to find something wrong with it and I find myself unable to do so.
This
incredibly brilliantly directed film stands out from the rest.  The camera
shots as well as the music choices where very well chosen and executed.
The
acting, well, I would not necessarily call it acting because it seemed so
natural that you forgot that they were even acting at all.  I am amazed
that
every single actor pulled it off.  The fact that it was based on a true
story made it even better.  I do not understand why the Academy did not
give
this film best picture.  The language is a little harsh at times, but it
is
said in a way that fits the film.  The violence is there but I did not
find
it as bad as the ending in Casino.  The almost follow up to this film.
