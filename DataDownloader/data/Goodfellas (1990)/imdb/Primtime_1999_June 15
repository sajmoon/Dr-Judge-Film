1999_June 15 

If there was a film that could come close to being better than my
favourite
film of all time, it would be GoodFellas. This film is so well done, it
left
me thinking about it for days. Martin Scorsese took a credible true story
(based on the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;), a superb cast (Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta,
Joe
Peschi, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino) and did his usual magic creating
interesting shots and a film that flows very smoothly.<br /><br />Some might say that GoodFellas has nothing on either of the first two
Godfather films, however, I have to disagree. The Godfather films were
based
on a family and the happenings throughout the years, while GoodFellas
takes
a much simpler story about a local group of Mafioso and the problems they
have with themselves. Where the Godfather films trace the wars between the
mafioso, GoodFellas traces the wars within a single group of
mafioso.<br /><br />I don't think there has ever been a more abrupt and to the point opening
sequence than the one in this film. It prepares you for the violence and
vulgarity to come, although there was less of it than I thought there
would
be. Contrary to what others say about this being a showcase for the ugly
side of the mob, there are more great dramatic scenes than violent
ones.<br /><br />Perhaps this was the best film of the 90's, but who really cares.
GoodFellas
will remain in my mind as one of the greatest of all time, and as such I
fully recommend this film to all. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small
bit
role (I believe he even says a word or two).<br /><br />9/10 stars.
