I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is
becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder,
action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own
category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at
GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.<br /><br />The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named
&quot;Wise Guy&quot; written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this
boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family
who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him
freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy
DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts
by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once
arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues
to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with
new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane
Bracco) &#150; he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and
gives in most of his gangster friends &#150; good fellows! The movie is
directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his
reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He
directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample
social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.<br /><br />All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci
who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction
that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of
characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is
okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into
mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his
brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters &#150; he loves to
play.<br /><br />The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those
eras with much ease and details.<br /><br />Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of
these mafia movies &#150; I do not feel that much excited. It has become
routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying
killings, blood everywhere &#150; showing crazy characters who pull out gun
at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and
the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.<br /><br />Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and
fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.<br /><br />(Stars 7 out of 10)
