Do not miss this movie.Do not miss any Marty's movie.A wonderful saga
about a mobster is a classic.Ray Liotta paints Henry Hills portrait and
makes his ''lifetime'' role.Bobby De Niro is also great as Jimmy Mcway
but the man that carry's the energy of the film is certainly Joe
Pesci.His role of Tommy,an aggressive gangster won him a ''oscar'' for
the best men supporting role.You almost want to take a picture of every
scene and putt it on the wall.If you love Mafia based movies,you will
love it.If you love Robert De Niro ,you will love it.Heck,if you love
violence you will enjoy.Just watch and enjoy.A beautiful movie,that
only Marty can make.
