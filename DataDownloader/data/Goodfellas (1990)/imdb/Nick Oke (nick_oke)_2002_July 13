Pesci gives one of the finest cinema performances of recent years. He
encapsulates the mood of the film - funny, disturbed, violent and with a
total disregard for other people's lives. Yet we still love
him!<br /><br />The 'funny how?' monologue in the restaurant is one of the great movie
speeches, right up there with 'you talkin to me?' and 'tears in the rain'.
It is there that we discover just who we are going to spend the next
couple
of hours with - a borderline psycho with a sense of humour! A man who
recreates the western 'dancing' scene with real bullets, a man who
cold-bloodedly assassinates Sam Jackson's doped up musician then asks his
dim-witted sidekick to make the coffee 'to go'.<br /><br />If I ever meet Mr Pesci I'd like to think I had the bottle to thank him
for
one of my favourite movie turns. Or maybe I'll just ask him to go get his
shine box...
