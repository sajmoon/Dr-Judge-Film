If it were not for The Godfather, this would be the best mob movie ever
made. Ray Liotta as Henry Hill was fantastic. Joe Pesci plays the
sickest SOB on the planet. I sometimes wonder if maybe he IS the
sickest SOB on the planet. And DeNiro? He plays DeNiro. And NOBODY can
play DeNiro the way he does. Paul Sorvino is the classic mob boss. And
I know. I've represented these guys. And if you ever had second
thoughts about Lorraine Bracco being a very hot looking woman and a
great actress, look no further than this movie.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to see it soon. If you
have seen it, make it a point to see it again.
