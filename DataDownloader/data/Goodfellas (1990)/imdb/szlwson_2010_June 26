I found this movie quite annoying, mainly due to the Tommy DeVito
character acting so stupid. <br /><br />I couldn&#x27;t believe a criminal organisation wouldn&#x27;t have been caught
before they did, with such a moron in it who would shoot a bar boy in
the foot just for not being quick enough with the coffee. If that
character hadn&#x27;t been in it, I&#x27;m sure I would have been a lot more
believable.<br /><br />I know that there are people like that in the world, but there&#x27;s no way
they would get away with much if people acted that stupid and obvious.<br /><br />It had a good message about how it&#x27;s better to not get involved with
those types and didn&#x27;t glamorise it as with the Godfather films. Maybe
it wasn&#x27;t such a bad idea to show them as a bunch of clowns, but I
still found it a little annoying at times as to how stupid they acted.
