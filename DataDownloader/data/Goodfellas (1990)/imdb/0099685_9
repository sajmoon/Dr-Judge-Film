Scorcese &amp; Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a
Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy. <br /><br />As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been
dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this
film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the
characters and lifestyle of mobsters.<br /><br />The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect &amp;
principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit
criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over
others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature
that comes with being a &quot;wiseguy&quot;, breeding with it paranoia that
others are not giving them the respect they deserve.<br /><br />An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona
is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid
killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates
for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships
are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy
through the forced smiles. <br /><br />Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and
would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of
anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes
of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have
actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be
surprised.
