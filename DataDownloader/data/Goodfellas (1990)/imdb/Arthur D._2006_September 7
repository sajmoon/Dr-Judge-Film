A lot of people think that scarface and the Godfather are the best
mafia-movies ever, but to me the best mob-movie would definitely be
Goodfellas...by far! Just as in the earlier &quot;Once upon a time in
America&quot; and the later &quot;Casino&quot;, Joe Pesci and Robert deNiro play
splendidly. Although it is a very long movie it never seems to bore and
the director took enough time to describe the characters. Great acting,
great story line, great characters, a lot of action, based on a true
story...these are just some of the ingredients that make Goodfellas the
best mafia movie ever in my opinion. It shows some similarities to
&quot;Once upon a time in America&quot; (not only because of Pesci &amp; deNiro), but
where &quot;once upon a time in America&quot; was rather slow Goodfellas is
filled with more action and there are more characters that are
interconnected. People who love &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot; will
definitely love this movie! It describes the rituals and macho culture
of the mob superbly
