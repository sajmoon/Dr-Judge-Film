1999_May 9 

I love this film for a # of reasons. It's script is unbelievable. Scorcese
is not afraid to say f!@# all the time. The acting is so believable and
superb. This is definitely Joe Pesci's best performance, and DeNiro's
second
best. (Next to Vito Corleone in Godfather Part 2) Also great performances
by
Paul Sorvino, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco. This film stayed with me
for
days. I couldn't stop thinking about Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy. I started
feeling like I could get away with things. I even started thinking cops
were
the bad guys! This feelings eventually went away, but still this was a
very
good film, and it was robbed of The Best Picture Academy Award. I guess it
is just another example of the Academy screwing Martin
Scorcese.
