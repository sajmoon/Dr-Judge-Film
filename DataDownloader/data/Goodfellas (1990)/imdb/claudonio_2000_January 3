Behind &quot;Terminator 2:Judgement Day&quot; &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is the best film of the
1990's. This film shows us the nitty gritty about life in the mafia, It also
features great performances from the entire cast, particularly Ray liotta
who gives the movie's best performance. Then there's Joe Pesci, Lorraine
Bracco, and Robert Deniro who all turn in great performances. This film is a
masterpiece. Much, Much better than &quot;The Godfather&quot;.
