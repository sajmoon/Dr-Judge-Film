Most of the time when i see a good movie I come to IMDb, and read some
user comments. I like to read the negative ones, to see how STUPID
people are. Well today after i saw this movie (i&#39;m 20 years old, but
never saw this movie before - shame) i wanted to see what do other
people say about it. This movie deserves 11/10 stars. I really REALLY
don&#39;t know why didn&#39;t it got an Oscar, but it&#39;s pity. Now 1 IDIOT user
wrote &quot;why do people rate movies like this so high?&quot; The only thing i
can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at
the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a
superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all.
Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for
yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back
then, sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my
heart: he ordered spaghetti and sauce, and he got ketchup with cheap
noodles - NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling
apart, we eat junk food, have to &quot;wait in line&quot;, quality of products
drop, no good music... (just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E
class.. cobra&#39;s simply wouldn&#39;t break down - Mercedes almost got
bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get
back to the movie. Another user wrote &quot;WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE
MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER..&quot; well i don&#39;t know what to
say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie,
but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story,
betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would
read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that
it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60&#39;s. real
life, true friends. Watch this movie, and feel it. I just love the old
mafia. So brutal, yet so catching. always together.. in good and bad..
