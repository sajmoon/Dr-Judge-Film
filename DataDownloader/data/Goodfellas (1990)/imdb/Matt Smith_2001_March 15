It is strange but I don't own my two favourite films ever on video or DVD
(the other is Shawshank) because it is always a pleasure to see them on the
TV and enjoy them all over again.  Goodfellas has it all; top notch acting,
novel screenplay, masterful direction (from the master himself) and
unobtrusive narrative.  I love everything about this film -
period.<br /><br />I'm sure I am preaching to the converted but if you haven't seen Goodfellas
then you are either insane or from Jupiter.<br /><br />
