This has become such a great movie to me I faithfully watch it once a
year. I wish it hadn&#39;t competed with &#39;Dances With Wolves&#39; in 1990
because, well, how can you argue with that decision. But if it had won,
I certainly would have been happy.<br /><br />Such an epic film; such great acting from everyone involved. Quite
frankly, I think it missed a lot of academy awards because, really, you
could have given it to everyone. How many supporting actors can you
give it to.<br /><br />But really, come on, Jeremy Irons over Ray Liotta?<br /><br />Anyway, I assume most have seen it and if you haven&#39;t then you have an
incredible movie to watch, if you wish.<br /><br />Every single scene was masterly directed by Scorsese. I saw this 15
years ago and was riveted to the screen.
