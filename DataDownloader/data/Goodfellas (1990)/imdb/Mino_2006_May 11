An absolute point of reference in Scorsese&#39;s work, one of the most
plastic, colorful and violent gangster-saga ever told. Some of the best
character-study of Scorsese&#39;s career, alongside Taxi Driver, Raging
Bull or Casino(clearly an annotation on Goodfellas, but nonetheless
brilliant, too), to name but a few. Teaming up once again with long
time friend De Niro and Pesci, and versatile Liotta(his first person
narrative, a Scorsese trademark, is one of the best i&#39;ve ever seen) he
delivers THE gangster movie of the 90&#39;s. The story of a kid who just
wants to become a gangster, teams up with the meanest fellas in the
neighborhood, and goes on to lead a life of crime and excess, and
ultimately pays the price.<br /><br />Joe Pesci is truly on top of his game in this one, almost stealing the
show, and creating the best almost likable ruthless and funny bad-guy
ever seen on screen(&quot;What the f**k is so funny about me ???&quot;-bit is
priceless).<br /><br />As long as the likes of Spielberg, Lucas and Clint Eastwood will
continue to be awarded Oscars, I hope that Scorsese will never be a
part of that charade and just continue to not compromise, because he&#39;s
clearly in a league of his own.
