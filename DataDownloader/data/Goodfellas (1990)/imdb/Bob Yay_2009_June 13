Goodfellas is a stylish, well executed film, and probably Martin
Scorcese&#x27;s best film. Based on the real life story of notorious
gangster Henry Hill, Goodfellas is up there with other Crime classics
such as; The Godfather (1 and 2) and Scarface. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci
and Robert De Niro give spectacular performances and Henry, Jimmy and
Tommy who regularly get involved with drugs, murders, heists and
thefts. From what I&#x27;ve heard it sticks very well to the book it was
based on (Wiseguy), and if it&#x27;s half as good as the film it will be
definitely worth the read. Goodfellas gets into my personal top 10
list, ranking as my personal favourite crime movie. See it.
