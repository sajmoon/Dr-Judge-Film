&quot;As Far Back as I can Remember, I Always wanted to be a Gangster&quot; With those
words, Martin Scorsese introduces us into the violent world of New York in
three decades of life in the Mafia.<br /><br />First of all, Martin Scorseses direction is top-notch, the editing frantic
and the acting magnificent. There is not one bit of music in this film, that
is not original, which makes the film unique.<br /><br />The voice-overs in the film are superb, and do a really good job of telling
the story.<br /><br />What is there not to like in this film???
I love this film 10/10<br /><br />
