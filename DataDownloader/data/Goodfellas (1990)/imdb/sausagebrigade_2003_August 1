Martin Scorsese is America's greatest director and this is his greatest
movie. It's detractors claim that it glamourises violence, it's cold
hearted, and that it's cartoonish, all of which are baseless. The ending
is
far from a glamorous outcome for Ray Liotta's Henry Hill, while there is
real warmth in many scenes, particularly the one in which Joe Pesci visits
his mother (played by Catherine Scorsese, Marty's mother). And if it is
cartoonish, at least it's more enjoyable than the comparitively sombre
Casino. Liotta is the centre of this movie and his performance is justly
towering. Joe Pesci is also memorable as Tommy, the most psychotic
gangster
ever. De Niro isn't as good here as in his other Scorsese collaborations
but
he's still silently menacing. Technically, tracking shots, cutting, freeze
frames and a rock/pop score are brilliantly used to create a vibrant
depiction of the gangster lifestyle. Goodfellas never looses it's grip,
not
even on repeat viewings. Deserves to be made compulsory
viewing.
