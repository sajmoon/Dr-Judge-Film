In his usual slick cinematic style, Scorcese brings to the screen this
blistering account of the inner workings of the gangster underworld.
Featuring memorable performances by de Niro as well as Pesci, the highlight
for any movie freak must be the two and a half minutes (+) steadicam shot
that will blow your mind away; it is sensationally smooth and a pure joy to
watch.
Highly Recommended!
