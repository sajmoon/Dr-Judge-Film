1999_October 21 

I've seen this film many times over and it never fails to amaze me how
people can criticize Ray Liotta's performance. Liotta's character is
pivotal
to the overall plot. Because he does not live up to a stereotype of a
gangster, people deem his performance as flat and uninteresting. Remember,
Liotta's character says &quot;I always wanted to be a gangster&quot; not &quot;I was born
to be a gangster&quot;. Over the course of the film, you can see Liotta's
character slowly dislike the life he wanted to be so much apart of. The
fact
that Liotta's character is only half Italian only highlights this point.
Other scenes like when Henry sees Jimmy and Tommy after the death of Stacks
and when all three are at Tommy's Mother's House further show Henry's
remorse for his life decisions. And at the very end of the film when he's
commenting on how he missed the old times, he seems to be happy. As the Sid
Vicious music starts and we see Henry going back into his house, he does so
with a smile, even when he slams the door and we here the slam of the &quot;cell
doors&quot;. Henry is content with the life he has, even if it means he has to
remain anonymous for the rest of his life. Liotta's performance as Henry
Hill is one of the most subtle and restrained performances I've seen in
recent memory. Its a pity that people have to listen to the comments of
critics to form their own opinions. People should see the movie and form
their own opinions first before running to the newspaper stand and reading
the what the critics say. Let's be a little bit more independent in our
thought and less dogmatic.
