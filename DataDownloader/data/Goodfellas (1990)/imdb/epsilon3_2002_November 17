Movies like Goodellas need no introduction. Almost everyone's seen it and
everyone (in their right mind) highly rates it. It's inspired countless
imitators and parodies - De Niro has made a living out of playing
Jimmy...I'm beginning to wonder if in future he'll see it as a weight
around
his neck as he must get offered every gangster role in
Hollywood.<br /><br />I rewatched it a couple of weeks ago and it still stands up as a
fantastic
piece of cinema. The acting is top notch and the script fantastic - the
oft
quoted Pesci scene 'you think I'm funny? Funny How?' is still very
effective. The soundtrack is great, blah blah blah...<br /><br />Yup - it's very good. If you haven't seen it (call yourself a movie
buff?)
then do so. If you have - see it again. My one negative comment is the
crappy quality of the DVD - will somebody get their act together and
release
an anamorphic widescreen version with some decent extras? Like I'm not
breaking your balls, but this is one of the greatest movies of the
twentieth
century and deserves some respect...<br /><br />
