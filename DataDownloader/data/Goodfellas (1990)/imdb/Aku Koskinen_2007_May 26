&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is Martin Scorsese&#39;s highest ranked movie over at IMDb. I
had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn&#39;t what I
expected it to be. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie,
but like Scorsese&#39;s movies usually it&#39;s over-hyped. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is
based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows
up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other
wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how
organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry
Hill from the beginning till the end.<br /><br />The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who&#39;s
played by Ray Liotta. The narration&#39;s excellent and keeps the movie
going in a good flow with it&#39;s precise use of words and witty sarcasm.
I&#39;ve never been so impressed of Liotta&#39;s performance than I was after
this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it
by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and
doing the whole progress of the character&#39;s corruption in a so
believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has
always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence
which can&#39;t be compared to any actor. I&#39;ve never seen Joe Pesci in such
a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also
does his best role performance yet to date. Then there&#39;s the mighty
Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can&#39;t go
wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be
honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right
actor/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.<br /><br />The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat
for you and that&#39;s one of the reasons why you can&#39;t miss this movie.
Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It&#39;s too long
and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn&#39;t deserve a 10.
The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the
time, you don&#39;t get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I
wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s downhill after that but I&#39;d say it just stops the
whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get
slightly too boring, hence why I said it&#39;s too long. I feel so bad
because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being
too long. The second hour just isn&#39;t nearly as interesting as the
first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it&#39;s Scorsese
and to me it&#39;s pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to
admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness
should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese
stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really
groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole
progress of the movie.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather
disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be
amazing, shouldn&#39;t it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of
the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a
slight disappointment for me it&#39;s still a definite recommendation for
all of you who love great movies. You don&#39;t have to like mob movies in
general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it,
giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It&#39;s not phenomenal,
but it&#39;s definitely a great movie.
