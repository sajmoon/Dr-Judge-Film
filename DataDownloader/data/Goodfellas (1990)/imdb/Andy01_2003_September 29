This movie is truly class.<br /><br />Right from the start you are introduced to the violence of the film, and
like all good gangster movies, the violence continues right the way
through.<br /><br />The 3 main characters play excellent roles, Pesci being a particularly
vicious one. Some of his actions are downright scary, from winding Ray
Liotta up early on in the film, to some of his actions later on. He really
is disturbed.<br /><br />The plot takes us through the life of Henry Hill (Liotta) from how he got
involved as a youngster, to how he ends up later on in
life.<br /><br />Some of the dialog is fantastic, Pesci joking with Liotta in the
restaurant
is memorable, and I find myself using lines from the film in daily life.
Picture the scene in a pub, someone bumps my friends drink over and
nothing
is said... Until I ask him &quot;Are you gonna let him away with
that...?&quot;<br /><br />I love true stories and violent gangster movies and this film has it all.
Easily my favourite film, I have watched it over and over several times,
and
its still brilliant.<br /><br />10 out of 10
