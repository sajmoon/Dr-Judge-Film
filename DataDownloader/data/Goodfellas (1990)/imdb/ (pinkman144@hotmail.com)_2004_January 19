Well, this review is probably very very late but I thought to my self why
not.
This movie is great I know, I'll be stupid to say anything else. The actors,
and I mean all of them did their job in a tremendous way, they were all
great, the directing, the story and the script are all a state of the
art.
But I was surprised to see that some people think that this movie is better
in all ways than the Godfather series, how can anyone say that, The
Godfather is the godfather of all gangsters movies, it's like a manual you
read before making a gangster movie in order to make the movie you are
making a hit movie. I watched Goodfellas years before I watched The
Godfather series but when I watched The Godfather part one, I was amazed by
how well this movie was made. I mean for anyone who thinks that Goodfellas
is better than The Godfather, if you watch the two movies carefully, you'll
find a scene in The Godfather part one when James Cann(Sonny) gets a call
from his sister Talia Shire(Connie) and finds out that her husband hit her
badly again, so he goes to her but he get whacked in the way over, the same
scene repeats itself in Goddfellas when Lorraine Bracco (Karen) calls Ray
Liotta(Henry) and the same thing happens again except that this time Ray
doesn't get whacked in his way over to beat the sh*t out of Karen's neighbor
friend.
It is wrong comparing any movie with the Godfather and vice versa but still
it is good that Martin Scorsese was able to make a movie that was and still
a movie that I like to watch from time to time and keep in mind that no one
is able to make movies like this anymore, not even Martin Scorsese
himself.
