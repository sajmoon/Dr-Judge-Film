The ultimate gangster film tells of the rise of a young man into the<br /><br />mafia (Ray Liotta's character.)  The movie starts off with them<br /><br />driving to dump a body;  what better way to start a narrative then to<br /><br />throw the audience into the confusing midst of it and having them<br /><br />try to figure everything out.  If anything bad ever came out of<br /><br />Scorsese, I want to see it.
