Goodfellas is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese based on a true story
about Henry Hill who&#x27;s a former gangster turned informant. The movie
stars Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul
Sorvino.<br /><br />Hilarious interaction between all of the characters especially with Joe
Pesci&#x27;s character with the whole &#x22;am I some kind of a comedian, here to
entertain you&#x22; scene. The movie covers a crew of mobsters who pulled
off some of the biggest heists in history ripping off the Idelewild
airport among other things.<br /><br />The movie begins in 1955 when Henry was just a kid and originally
started to make connections with the crime family run by Paul Sorvino&#x27;s
character and ended in 1980 when Hill was busted with Cocaine.
