I just finished watching &quot;Goodfellas&quot; again, and while of course
agreeing with most of the comments about the movie being a masterpiece,
there's something else I want to point out...the music. Especially the
use of &quot;Layla&quot; in the whacking scenes of pretty much everyone connected
with the Luftansa heist. That has got to be one of the best uses of
music in a film, bar none.<br /><br />That being said, I also want to give kudos to the performance of Paul
Sorvino-the understated menace of his portrayal of Paul Cicero is
something you only start to appreciate after multiple viewings. I've
seen this film at least 20 times, and only after my last viewing have I
truly come to appreciate his performance.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci were extremely brilliant of course, but Ray
Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill, IMO, is one of the best ever to grace
the screen. One note of brilliance is the last scene in the courtroom,
where he gets up off the witness stand and talks directly to the
audience, while the other characters remain in the background. Martin
Scorcese is a genius, and this scene is one of the best in all of
cinema. It's hard for me to single out one thing, because it's rare
that a movie contains excellence in so many areas. I can't say enough
about this movie, it may be the best film ever made. I can't recommend
it enough.
