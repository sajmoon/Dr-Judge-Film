GoodFellas shows us the side of the New York Italian mafia that The
Godfather never allowed us to see.  In GoodFellas, we see the small-time
hoods, the killings, the smaller mob crews; the brutal underbelly of the
mob.  In The Godfather, we see the romantic and luxurious side of the mob.
This movie is great, also, because it is a true story, based on real life
events as told by the man played by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).
Fantastic direction, plot, characters, drama, and action.  This movie is a
definite 10.
