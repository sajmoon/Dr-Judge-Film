By one of the most overrated directors ever. Mindless, incoherent,
unceasing violence. Narration is almost always a bad idea in a movie
and this movie is no exception. A little narration can be okay but when
it is such a dominant part of a movie, it subtracts and doesn't add.
But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all
the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and
basically &quot;skimmed&quot; (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30
seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable
that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this
piece of crap.<br /><br />The shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that
include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver,
Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember
and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of
Christ or Goodfellas.
