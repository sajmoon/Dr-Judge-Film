&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the best film of the 90's, no doubt. Among mob movies it
is topped only by the king of them, &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The film is about the
real-life story of Henry Hill, a young half-Sicilian gangster who
eventually
gave evidence to the FBI about his friends' organized crime activities, and
then disapperead into the Federal Witness Protection Program. The movie
takes place over a period of about 25 years. We see Henry become more and
more powerful in &quot;the organization&quot;, and then we watch his rapid decline.
Along the way, Henry meets wonderful (well, not really) characters such as
Tommy (Joe Pesci), and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Both do an excellent
job, especially Pesci, who copped a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting
Actor. It also stars Lorraine Bracco from &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as Henry's wife,
Karen. The best, however, is Ray Liotta as Henry Hill himself. It is a
wonder why he did not recieve an Oscar for Best Actor for this. Martin
Scorcese directed and co-wrote the film, and this is just another way of
confirming my belief that he just can't make a bad picture. 10/10, ****,
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
