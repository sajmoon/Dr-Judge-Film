This movie throws originality and creativity at you, and it&#x27;s
impossible for you to not be captivated. This movie is the entertaining
itself, and because of its excellent direction, editing, and
performances, this movie is a masterpiece, and one of the best.<br /><br />This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960&#x27;s
and 70&#x27;s New York. Henry Hill (Liotta) is a local boy turned gangster
in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito
(Pesci) is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry&#x27;s best
friend. Jimmy Conway (De Niro) puts the two of them together, and runs
some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen.
After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of
the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Sorvino), to live the life of luxury
he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a
jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.<br /><br />Scorsese, who is one of the best directors of all time (If not the
best), probably made his best work with this one (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s
better than &#x22;Casino&#x22;, but it probably is), his camera angles are
amazing, and the narrative never let the movie get boring. And with the
incredible editing, that is as good as the direction With a cast of Ray
Liotta, De Niro, and Joe Pesci, I don&#x27;t even need to say how
mesmerizing the acting is, specially by Pesci, who make his character
so hot head that you don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s going to kiss the guy, or kill
him. Ray Liotta surprised me in this one, and he was awesome, and of
course, with the help of his charismatic character. De Niro is... Do I
really have to say? <br /><br />Verdict: Scorsese&#x27;s masterpiece, and one of the best movies of all
time, with amazing performances by all it&#x27;s cast, specially by Pesci,
you&#x27;ll notice that this film is beyond good.
