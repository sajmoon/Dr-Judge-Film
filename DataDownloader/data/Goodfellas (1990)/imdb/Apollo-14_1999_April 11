What a great movie!  Immediately engaging, this movie grabs you from the
throat right from the start and never lets go. Through the eyes of Ray
Liotta's character, we are introduced into a dizzying world full of
memorable characters.<br /><br />The mafia world is at once glamourized, as the young Liotta grows up to
become a prominent figure in the family.  Then his dream starts to fall
apart as that world of glamour and easy money collapses on him.  Similar in
its theme to Scarface, this movie is a level above Stone's masterpiece, more
stylish, very nineties and comes with a killer soundtrack.<br /><br />Although you should watch this movie for many reasons, Joe Pesci and Robert
DeNiro alone are worth the rental price.  Their characters are simply
unforgettable.
