Quite possibly the best mob movie ever, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; delivers to the mind
the most permanent and lasting impressions than any movie I've ever seen.
Martin Scorsese, unbelieveably, outdoes himself again, with the help of
some of the industry's best actors.  Although Ray Liotta is the figure-point
of the film, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro steal the show.  Now, don't get me
wrong...Liotta puts out a solid performance.  But the acting of Pesci and De
Niro is what keeps this movie in your VCR.  The mix of Scorsese and De Niro
once again proves to the people that &quot;practice makes perfect.&quot;  If you want
to know what I'm talking about, check out the scene in the bar where the
camera zooms in on De Niro, with &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; in the background.
Wow.
