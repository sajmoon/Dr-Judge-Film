GOODFELLAS (1990) **** Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine
Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Mike
Starr,  Michael Imperioli, Kevin Corrigan.  Martin Scorsese's blockbuster
masterpiece look at the world of organized crime based on the true-life
account of Henry Hill (excellently portrayed by Liotta) and his life lessons
in the Mob.  Chilling and unflinchingly violent and funny (both thanks to a
disturbing Pesci, Best Supporting Actor, as an out-of-control wiseguy). 
Brilliant direction and strong performances, as well as its nostalgic
production values.  Memorable Steadicam shot of The Copacabana in New York
and Pesci's &quot;I'm funny&quot; uneasy scene.
