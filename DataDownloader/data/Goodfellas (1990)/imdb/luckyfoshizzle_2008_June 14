As a teenager Henry Hill&#39;s (Ray Liotta) dream begins to come true when
he lands a spot during jobs for a local mob. To him, things can only go
up from this point and they do. For awhile anyway.<br /><br />Eventually he is turned into a certified member of the mob family. He
gets married and starts a family all while working for the mob. He
hangs out with many different characters from his mob family, including
mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvina), Jimmy (Robert De Niro), and Tommy (Joe
Pesci). As time goes on, Henry comes across a few rough patches.<br /><br />This movie is just an amazing movie. I&#39;ve never been really into mob
movies, but this one is just too good to pass up. Everything is great,
the acting, the writing, just everything.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast of characters, all with dramatically
different personalities brought together by the mob. Henry is the type
that can act both innocent and deadly at the same time. Tommy is a true
off the wall psychopath with a crazy sense of humor. Jimmy is you&#39;re
typical gangster who can go from your best friend to your worst enemy
in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is by far one of the most talented directors of our
time and this is one of his finest pieces of work. It&#39;s worth watching
even if you&#39;re not much into mobster movies. Although, if you just have
a problem with violence or mobsters in general, pass this one up.
