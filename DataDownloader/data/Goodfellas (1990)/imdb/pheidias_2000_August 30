I found this movie too cute.  The characters are brightly colored but not
especially complex.  It's nothing more than nihilistic comedy, albeit done
with amazing skill.  The movies that deserve ratings of 9 and 10 engage
more
of the range of our emotions than this does.  This shortcoming probably
has
to do with the somewhat eager camera and lighting that put every scene at
the same emotional distance from the viewer.<br /><br />Frequent violence and cursing do not have to be objectionable in a film,
but
here they often seem wanton or voyeuristic.<br /><br />Perhaps rather than &quot;cute&quot; I should say &quot;deft&quot; or &quot;neat&quot; or &quot;pat&quot;.  At any
rate, this is not on a par with The Godfather, and I gave it a
7.
