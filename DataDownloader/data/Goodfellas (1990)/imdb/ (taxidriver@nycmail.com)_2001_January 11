Absolutely terrific from the beginning to the end. Martin Scorsese directs
my personal favorite of all of his films. The acting is perfect on every
cast members part, the script is a fantastic adaption, the direction is
genius, and despite not having an original score, the great oldies sound
track works just as well. Ray Liotta does a truly good job as the lead, Joe
Pesci won an Oscar for his supporting actor performance, and Robert De Niro
is perfect as always. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also fantastic
additions to the supporting cast. No film has ever shown the brutal
realities of the underworld quite like GoodFellas. A completely amazing film
that can not be overlooked, underrated, or missed. See it if you haven't
already.<br /><br />*****/5
