Working from a smart script based on Henry Hill's actual life story (as
told
to Nicholas Pileggi), Scorsese directs the best movie ever made about life
in the mean, violent world of the gangster.  The combination of a tight,
interesting plot and vividly realized characters always makes for a good
film, but the realism imbued by Hills story makes this a truly superior
gangster flick.<br /><br />The screenplay (Co-written by Scorsese and Pillegi) and the cinematography
capture the sudden violence of the street in a way you don't see in most
over produced set pieces (think Die Hard).  What most impresses me is how
penetrating and accurate Ray Liotta's voiceovers are. The freeze frames
and
quick cuts between characters vividly convey the way a player figures
things
out when working the streets; showing how they compute the angles and
figure
out what lurks beneath the surface, is masterful, conveying a realism I've
never seen in film, especially not in some stylized crime films like the
Godfather.
