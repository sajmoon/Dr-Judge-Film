Take one of the best directors cinema has ever produced, add arguably the
greatest actor, mix in with a carear defining lead performance, season
heavily with a comedy/violent mix previously unheralded with a Pesci sauce,
garnish with a sexy clump of Bracco.  For full flavour sprinkle in a
supporting cast with strong flavour- particularly vital is the Sorvino berry
and serve up a mouth watering feast of family, friends, crime, violence,
comedy, pathos and a pinch of being pinched.  N.B. Flavour is heightened
significantly garnished by a soundtrack which brings out the rich flavour of
all the ingredients.
