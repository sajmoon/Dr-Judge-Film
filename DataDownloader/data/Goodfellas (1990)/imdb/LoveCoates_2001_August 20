2001_August 20 

I saw this movie again a few days ago. I think I enjoyed it more...their are
a lot of nuances I didn't catch the first time. I think the layering makes
it exceptional, though the plot itself is still excessively episodic, jumpy
and alienating.<br /><br />By the way, in my previous review of &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; I said that Francis Ford
Coppola is dead. I should have put it in quotations. It was a joke in
reference to the fact that Scorsese is still making good movies and Coppola
hasn't really done anything worthwhile since...god, since before I was born.
Feels dead to me.
