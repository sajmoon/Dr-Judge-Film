If there is one comment that could truly do justice to a film as great as
Goodfellas it is this: If you are tired of the mindless subordinant trash
that Hollywood releases year after year then by all means see Goodfellas.
Now I know what everyone is thinking Ray Liotta is in it and he hasn't
exactly had the best film career to date but trust me when I say that he
gives a performance like none you will ever see in a film. The way he
portrays the flawed nature of Henry Hill is simply brilliant. Robert De
Niro
accompanies Liotta's presence with something only De Niro can accomplish
when he steps out in front of that camera. It is amazing that in De Niro's
over 30 years in the business he has made only one, yes one, error ( Rocky
and Bullwinkle.) This man never ceases to amaze me. The way De Niro is
able
to portray each and every character of his is uncanny and evident in this
picture. Throw in the Academy Award winning performance of Joe Pesci and
the
once again ingenius directing of the man who can not fail, Martin
Scorsese,
and you have what is known as one of the greatest films in the history of
film. A must see. If you go your entire life without having seen
Goodfellas
then you truly have not lived.<br /><br />Rating: 10 out of 10 (If a higher rating existed I would surely affix it t
o
this film.)
