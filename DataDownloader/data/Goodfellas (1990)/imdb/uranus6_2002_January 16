This one is absolute one of my favourite. The acting performances of
De Niro and Pesci are excellent as well as the description of the real
mob live during 1950-1980. The murder scenes are put very well
together.They
are brutal as hell.If you like
Scarface, Casino, Godfather or Resevoir Dogs the this one is for you.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10
