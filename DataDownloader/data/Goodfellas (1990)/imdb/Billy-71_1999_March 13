GoodFellas is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was a
great movie because it had every type of movie in it. There was action,
comedy, drama, and suspense. Not only was the movie great but the actors
were great also. Some of today's best known actors were in it like Robert De
Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Paul Sorvino. This movie was also nominated
for six Academy Awards in 1990, including Best Picture, and Best Director.
Joe Pesci did win the award for the Best Supporting Actor. The movie is
about how the mob really was. How they worked, how they lived, why they
killed, and why there really was a mob in the first place. The only thing I
didn't like about it, was that every other word was a cuss word. Otherwise,
it is a great movie. The whole movie was based on the best selling book,
&quot;WiseGuy,&quot; written by Nicholas Pileggi. So if you want to see a great movie
watch Goodfellas. It is very entertaining and a little surprise at the end.
