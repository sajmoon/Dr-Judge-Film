The words &quot;best of all time&quot; and &quot;greatest ever&quot; get lobbied about far too
frequently, but in the case of Goodfellas, it is no exaggeration.
Goodfellas
is the best gangster movie ever, surpassing other gems such as Mean
Streets
and Casino (mediocre compared to Goodfellas). No need to say anything
more,
you've all seen it. And if by chance you haven't, what are you waiting
for?
