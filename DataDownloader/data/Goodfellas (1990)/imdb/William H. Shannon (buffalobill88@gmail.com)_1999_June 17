1999_June 17 

It happened again.  Just as America's greatest living (greatest ever?)
director created the best film of the decade in 1980 -- &quot;Raging Bull&quot; --
and
lost the Oscar to Robert Redford's &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (an outrage by all
accounts), yet another thespian's pretentious film -- Kevin Costner's
&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; -- beats out one of the best acted, best directed,
most
kinetically charged and most entertaining/horrifying films ever created...
&quot;GoodFellas&quot;<br /><br />This is one hell of a ride.  Everything in the film is perfect.  The
soundtrack perfectly mirrors the time period (musically and lyrically,
from
&quot;Rags to Riches&quot; to &quot;My Way&quot;).  Joe Pesci is a revelation.  Of course he
could be a thug, but they way his Tommy DeVito enters every shot as an
unknown factor -- &quot;Is he going to snap?&quot; is the only thing we can think of
-- gives the film an edge that would not have been the same with another
actor.  Robert DeNiro is, of course, terrific, and Ray Liotta inhabits the
character unlike he's done since.<br /><br />But the real star is Martin Scorsese.  Just when it seems that &quot;Raging
Bull&quot;
would be his apex, I think &quot;GoodFellas&quot; may top it, on the basis of scope
and technique.  It's not just a man as in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot;
his other legendary works.  It's a whole lifestyle, a way of being.  And
it
follows three decades of a &quot;family's&quot; rise and fall.  And there is never a
slow or tedious moment.  The movie is raw action.  Whether it's the
hellish
tracking shots or the point of view shots or the way the trunk lets off an
evil red glow, everything is for a reason.  And the double voice-over
technique is brilliant, because it gives two different perspectives of
mafia
life.<br /><br />&quot;GoodFellas&quot; does not try to glorify the mob life... it just presents it
as
it is, blood and all.  And 20 years from now tell me if &quot;Ordinary People&quot;
and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; are that great...
