this movie is unbelievable. Scorsese is an unbelievable director he
makes every shot is unique and the performances by Joe pesci, ray
liotta and Robert De Niro are all amazing. especially Joe pesci.
Scorsese is great, i mean it was amazing how in some scenes he can use
the music to show what people are thinking. this is the greatest film
of all time and i have a hard time finding people who've even heard of
it. it's so under-appreciated that i want to just force everyone in the
world to watch it. this movie is so over-whelming. the first time i saw
it i couldn't take it all in and i didn't think much of it. but the
second time i was like holy ****.
