1999_March 22 

All gangster movies will inevitably be compared to &quot;The Godfather&quot; series,
but this one shines because it takes a daring, and hugely successful risk
in
not playing it for serious drama the whole way. It actually almost
succeeds
in making you &quot;like&quot; Henry Hill and his crew of Wiseguys. With the witty
narration and comedic style, it's almost a fun comedy...and then,
suddenly,
savagely, it wrenches you back to reality as the plot takes a sinister,
nasty turn.<br /><br />The classic scene in this picture has to be how Tommy (Joe Pesci)
establishes the true maniacal menace of his character, without any
*doubt*,
and without any bloodshed. A lesser film would have shown you a few bloody
examples of what Tommy is capable of as a sensational copout. The
brinksmanship of the &quot;You think I'm funny?&quot; scene sells his character well
before the trouble starts.
