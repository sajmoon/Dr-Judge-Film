I've watched Goodfellas at least 15 times and each time I'm entertained
and
this is why.  The performances by all actors are superb.  Even if you're
not
an organized crime genre fanatic, but like stories with struggle, success
and corruption, then check it out.<br /><br />The narrative style of story telling gives you the feeling you're a voyeur
watching (as all film audiences do) with a sense that you're getting away
with something.  The first half is a story of young Henry's development
from
boy to young man and it's quite a fun trip.  As a young man, he achieves a
level of success within the organization he is a `member' of and has a lot
o
fun in the process.  Then things get out of hand and there is a price for
all the wrong doings of the past.<br /><br />The last section's pace of the movie is awesome.  You get the feeling your
spinning out of control with Henry and Karen during a Sunday where there
is
a lot of `errands' to get done while the Feds watch.  Paranoia is
validated.<br /><br />Scorsese's films do that to you.  They make you feel what's going on with
the characters in the story.
