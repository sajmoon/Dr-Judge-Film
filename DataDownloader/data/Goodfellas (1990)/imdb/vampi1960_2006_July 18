Before the sopranos conquered the cable TV airwaves there was
good-fellas,aka;the saga of henry hill,as an Italian from new jersey i
enjoy these films.only if they are done as well as good-fellas.with an
awesome cast,check it out;Robert DE niro,Joe pesci,ray liotta,Paul
sorvino,Lorraine(Dr melfi)bracco,and frank Vincent(from the sopranos)
this is based on a true story about mob snitch henry hill,it documents
all the mob activity.since henry hill was half Irish he could&#39;nt be
made,rules you know,it is what it is.this is the greatest mob movie
since the godfather,the other being a Bronx tale.Joe pesci has a field
day,with his memorable scene;what do you mean I&#39;m funny.heres some
trivia,Micheal imperioli(Christopher from the sopranos)plays spider.
Robert DE niro and ray liotta went on to be in;Copland with sly
Stallone.if you enjoy mob movies like i do,you will enjoy good-fellas.
its a mob movie with heart.recently they released a special edition
DVD, with all the extras.10 out of 10.and like tony soprano says;it is
what it is!
