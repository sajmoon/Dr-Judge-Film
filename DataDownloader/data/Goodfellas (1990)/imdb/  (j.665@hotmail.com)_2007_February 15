In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over
the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2
are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies
are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things
that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour
this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather&#39;s can be much too serious
at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers&#39;s no
room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite
nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at
times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten
minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and
performances....i guess i&#39;ll call that one a draw. If you like this one
check out Casino. It&#39;s not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather&#39;s but
still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are
Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar
Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that.
