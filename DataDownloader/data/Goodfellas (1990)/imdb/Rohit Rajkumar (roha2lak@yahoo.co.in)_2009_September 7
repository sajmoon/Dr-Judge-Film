Another mob film and this too delivers.Goodfellas definitely comes
close to The Godfather series in terms of mob violence and acting.And
that too is a big achievement.<br /><br />The pace of the film is what you&#x27;ve got to watch out for.It is
definitely fast as compared to The Godfather but in terms of acting it
definitely lacks a bit to The Godfather stalwarts.<br /><br />Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro all deliver knock out
performances in this gangster drama.Goodfellas is one of the greatest
movies ever made and would definitely haunt you for days to come.In one
word,Amazing.
