I watched this again recently and was amazed at much better it is when not
compared to the Godfather. Joe Pesci creates an unforgettable character in
Tommy - both horrifying and funny. Ray Liotta does his best work since
&quot;Something Wild&quot; and more than holds his own against Robert DeNiro. Look for
some excellent supporting work from Lorraine Bracco, Debi Mazar and Paul
Sorvino. The running narration (normally overused and worthless i.e.
&quot;Bladerunner&quot;) works here because it feels like Henry is talking to us
casually, like we're sitting at the same bar and he's unfolding this story.
The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint is the length. I felt that
the whole ending could have been shortened by 20 minutes or so. There is a
long sequence of events regarding Henry that are totally
uneccessary.
Watch this with some red wine and a Hot Italian hoagie dripping with sauce.
Bravissimo!
