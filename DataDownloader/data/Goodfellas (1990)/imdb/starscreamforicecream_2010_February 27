So is anyone else sick and tired of over-the-top &#x22;Cool Gangster&#x22;
movies? I am completely burnt out on hearing about what a great movie
this is. I watched it for the first time recently and was blown away by
the ridiculous pervasive language and big ego-ed tough guy mobsters.
Yeah, Joe Pesci is the epidomy of intimidation! This movie ranks right
up there, floating around at the top of the toilet bowel with Scarface,
and this mornings used breakfast burrito. I can&#x27;t believe I hear people
talk about how great this and some of those other gangster movies are.
I doubt any real gangsters get to behave in any fashion remotely close
to this without being arrested. My favorite part was when stupid little
Joe Pesci gets murdered, as the end was undoubtedly near. Untouchables
was better. So was Space Jam. Whatever goodfellas people. Your favorite
movie of time belongs in the garbage.
