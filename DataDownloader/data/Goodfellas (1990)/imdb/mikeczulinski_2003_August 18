&quot;From as far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster&quot;
are Henry Hill's words in the opening sequence, which makes for a good
introduction. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the story of real-time mobster Henry Hill
and
his mafia career, which in the end, doesn't turn out as he suspected it
would. As a young teenager, Henry begins working for Paul Cicero who is
the
&quot;head&quot; man in charge of the operations. As you watch this film, you will
notice that Paulie has one of those serious, funny sides to him. It is
almost like a serious paranoia case, similar to Tony Soprano, which I find
somewhat humourous.<br /><br />This film is also based on real-time mobster Jimmy Burke, who is portrayed
in the film as Jimmy Conway.(But whole plot mainly focuses on Hill)
Working
alongside Henry and Jimmy, there is also Tommy Devito, who Joe Pesci
played
brilliantly, and was well deserving of the Oscar that he won for best
supporting role. I found Pesci to be hilarious in the movie, especially
with
the two restaurant scenes. His character simply stole the show, and is
portrayed as a classic hot-headed bad guy.(loved him impersonating the
Oklahoma Kid)<br /><br />And then you have De Niro who is his usual self, as one of the greatest
actors of our time. De Niro shows great emotion in the dramatic telephone
scene outside of the restaurant, which is Oscar worthy. I found Conway to
be
the most responsible out of the three, due to more experience in the
business, and a great natural instinct of leadership, which is clearly
shown
and told, as he was doing hits for mob bosses at the age of
16.<br /><br />I found that Liotta was excellent as well, playing a crazy and violent
Henry
Hill, with those cold and icy eyes that can look right through you. The
immediate thing that I picked up on, and found funny about Liotta's part,
was his psychotic laugh. My favourite Liotta laugh moments are in the
restaurant scene with Tommy, and when Jimmy is choking Morrie with the
telephone cord, and Morrie's wig falls off. A great supporting actress in
the film, who I found rather charismatic, was Lorraine Bracco, who played
Henry's wife Karen. I found that Lorraine's character took a huge
transformation in the film when she first married Henry, most likely due
to
the mob which is commonly portrayed as destroying marriages.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great all-star cast with excellent appeal to the
audience, and to the genre of gangster films. The film was great, but the
ending leaves somewhat of an empty feeling, with no exciting conclusion.
But
after all it was realistic, and it was based on a true story, which leaves
me satisfied. Also loved the choice of music for the scenes, and the Eric
Clapton theme. 8.5/10. Best mob movie since the Godfather
II.<br /><br />
