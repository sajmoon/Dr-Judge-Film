Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:R(should be 18A)<br /><br />I saw Goodfellas one night on showcase action.I have been hearing great
things about this film and Goodfellas definitely lives up to its
hype.The film has an all star cast consisting of Ray Liotta,Joe
Pesci,Robert DeNiro and a small part from Samuel L Jackson.This film
also has four characters from The Sopranos acting in the film.The four
characters from the sopranos in this film are Tony&#39;s
Psychayatrist,Christopher,Paulie and Big P***y.Goodfellas is a nice
long film with excellent acting,storyline and lots of entertainment
value.The film shows the life of a mobster named Henry Hill and all the
things he must do in the mafia life.Goodfellas is an entertaining mafia
movie and fans of such mafia films will definitely want to buy
goodfellas.<br /><br />Runtime:145min <br /><br />10/10
