&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a masterpiece of moviemaking, combining a taut script,
outstanding direction and a perfect cast to pull the viewer into the life of
the mob. Based on the true story of Henry Hill (the excellent Ray Liotta),
the movie exudes realism, often unsettling, never boring. Nothing is glossed
over. The violence, language, criminal behavior and fear is presented
without any protective coating.<br /><br />There are no heroes in this film. We aren't asked to accept the characters,
only see them for what they are. Joe Pesci, in a well-deserved Oscar-winning
role, is equaled by Robert DeNiro, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and
Liotta.<br /><br />No doubt one of the best movies ever made.
