This is one of the greatest movies of all time never mind the best mob
movie. It has an amazing and realistic plot with outstanding
performances from Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco
and all of the other actors and actress&#39;s in the film. When watching in
it didn&#39;t want to blink in case i missed something. Martin Scorsese is
an amazing director all of his films i have seen i have loved. If you
enjoyed the departed you would love this. It is mainly considered a
film for men seen as women normally enjoy soppy romantic movies and men
like the hard gritty stuff, well i&#39;m a fan of both and i think anyone
with any taste in film will love this. It will stay on my Favorites
list forever.
