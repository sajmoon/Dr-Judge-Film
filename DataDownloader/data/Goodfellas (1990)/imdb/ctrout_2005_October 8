Goodfellas is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) an ambitious young
Irish-Italian American who becomes surrounded by a gritty world of
crime and violence, set in '60s and '70s New York, while trying to
climb the ladder of success in the Mafia. His two best friends are
Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). The latter
is one of the most vile and disgusting characters ever captured on
film. His wife is Karen (Lorraine Braaco) and she seems to be the only
one who sees where Henry is truly going if he continues to stay in this
brutal life of crime.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of the life of Henry Hill and what
a life that must have been. A life of prisons, robberies, drugs, and
hijacks is no way to live, but the main characters does all of them to
keep his reputation and his fortune. He doesn't count on betrayal and
death to turn him against that life of luxury, but he finds out that he
must choose between the life of crime that's spiraling downward or a
life of a rat that might have a chance to live in peace.<br /><br />That gritty world of crime ended up being too gritty for my tastes. And
all of the characters were much too grotesque to be likable. Even our
main character is a scumbag that doesn't know what he's gotten himself
into until it might be too late. Since there wasn't one character in my
eyes that I could relate to or that redeemed himself, I had to rate
this movie like any other Scorsese film that failed to give me what I
wanted. Therefore, I didn't like this film and am not surprised since
all of the Scorsese films that I've seen up to this point were made in
the same fashion.<br /><br />Somehow, the film went on to win an Academy Award for Joe Pesci as Best
Supporting Actor at the 1990 Oscars. It was nominated for five other
Oscars that year including Picture, Director, Supporting Actress
(Braaco), Adapted Screenplay, and Editing.
