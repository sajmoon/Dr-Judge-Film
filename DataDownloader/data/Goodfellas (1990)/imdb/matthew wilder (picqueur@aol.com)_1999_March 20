1999_March 20 

The most joyous explosion of sheer cinema energy since CITIZEN KANE. Some
may prefer the visceral emotions of RAGING BULL or the trance state of
TAXI
DRIVER, but this is the one where Scorsese took his place as the
uncontested
champion of American filmmakers. Scorsese uses his virtuosity playfully,
gigglingly, like Mozart or Michael Jordan; you can practically hear him
cackling, &quot;Can you believe what I can do?&quot; He doesn't use his talents to
bully the audience into admiration, as Spielberg sometimes does; it's like
he's telling a fabulous joke he's cracking up over almost too much to
complete. Of all American movies of recent decades, this is the one that
stales the least with repeat viewings; you could watch it a hundred times
and still feel the shiver of delight it produced on a first viewing. The
perfectness of it in all regards produces a strange thrill in the audience
when seeing it projected--you feel the crowd wanting to stand up and
dance.
With Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, Joe Pesci and Lorraine
Bracco;
every performance is flawless, down to the tiniest bit players.
Cinematography by Michael Ballhaus. Edited by Thelma
Schoonmaker.
