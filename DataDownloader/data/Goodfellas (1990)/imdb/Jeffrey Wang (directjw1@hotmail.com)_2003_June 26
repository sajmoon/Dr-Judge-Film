Martin Scorsese is the greatest living American director, and Goodfellas is
clearly his masterpiece.  The reason why is because it is essentially a
culmination of all the themes and filmic styles he was working with prior to
Goodfellas.  What makes Goodfellas stands out is the passion which Scorsese
displays in every scene.  Unlike Casino and Gangs of New York, which were
also great movies, Goodfellas has a sense of enjoyment and liveliness amidst
all the carnage.<br /><br />After Goodfellas, Scorsese made plenty of great movies, but nothing he has
done since, and prior to Goodfellas, reaches the pinnacle of this miraculous
piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Long live Scorsese!
