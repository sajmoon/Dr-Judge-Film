Upon the first viewing of Goodfellas, one has to be struck by its
fast-paced
and entertaining nature.  This is a rare kind of movie that makes you feel
as though you are part of the action, and it doesn't do this through
incredible special effects.  Rather, Goodfellas wraps you in because of
superb acting and filming, a captivating screenplay, and an engaging
soundtrack- all the elements of a great movie.<br /><br />There is no denying this is one of the best films of this decade.
However,
I do not think  this movie is flawless, as many on this website believe.
While the first hour of the movie is entertaining, the second half gets
bogged down with overly extended scenes- in particular the one where Henry
Hill thinks he is being followed.  The movie loses the punch that it had
in
the beginning.  It's as though Scorsese got sick and tired of making the
movie and he decided to speed up the process a bit,
and this results in the last hour of the movie being a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Goodfellas is a fine move that is worth seeing for anyone
interested in entertaining films.
