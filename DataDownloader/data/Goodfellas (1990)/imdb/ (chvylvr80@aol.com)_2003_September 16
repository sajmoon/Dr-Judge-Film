Goodfellas blows The Godfather away. You read that right. The Godfather is a
bloated, wheezing blob compared to this tight masterpiece. The real jewel of
this film is the incredible cast, everyone turning in Oscar caliber
performances. Goodfellas is one of those movies that you can watch hundreds
of times and never get sick of it. Ray Liotta's narration gives you the lay
of the land on the story and never grates on your nerves. Martin Scorcese's
direction is a thing of beauty and Joe Pesci's performance is the best of
his career, even considering he played basically the same character in
Casino. A great soundtrack and dazzling cinematography make this film a
national treasure. Bottom Line: The power of this film cannot be
underestimated and I wouldn't be out of line by saying this is Scorcese's
best film. Truly a masterpiece.
