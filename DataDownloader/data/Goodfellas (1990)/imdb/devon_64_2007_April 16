Everyone in their right mind knows that Martin Scorsese is one of the
greatest directors of all time and that his depiction of &#39;gangster&#39;
movies is second to none. This comes from his upbringing which he so
brilliantly translates onto the screen. No one can translate the
passion and emotion like Scorsese can from his past experiences onto
the screen. Although Scorsese leaves his footprints in every movie he
makes, his most pertinent footprints are left in the films Mean
Streets(1973) and Goodfellas(1990). Scorsese grew up in ItalianAmerican
New York. That being said, he is a master at conveying the lies,
deception, and greed which occurs in regular &#39;gangster&#39; life.
Goodfellas mainly focuses in on the life of Henry Hill portrayed by Ray
Liotta. It follows him from a young boy, through his dealings with the
mob, his drug addiction and jail time, and to his eventual court case
and permanent stay in the witness protection program. Goodfellas is
full of sheer drama, a taste of guns knives, and a whole lot of raw
gangster lifestyle beautifully portrayed by Liotta, Joe Pesci, and
Robert De Niro. These three, combined with Scorsese seemingly give the
movie its color. In terms of gangster films, nothing can compare with
the realistic atmosphere which Scorsese continues to create time and
time again.
