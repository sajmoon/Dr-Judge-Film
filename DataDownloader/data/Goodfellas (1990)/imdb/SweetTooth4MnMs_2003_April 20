&quot;Goodfellas&quot; was a really good movie and Joe Pesci deserved that Oscar for
his role, but I still don't like gangster movies. I can't handle all that
gratuitous violence and profanity. I don't like seeing people do drugs and
everything in this movie disturbed me. But it was good, don't get me wrong.
I'm not badmouthing this movie or anything. I just hate gangster movies. I
don't think there is any need for us to see blood spraying out of someone's
head. And do we really need to hear the &quot;F&quot; word a hundred times? What's the
point of that? I think there should be a limit on how many times it can be
said in a movie. But I enjoyed all three of the lead actors' performances
and this was acting at its best. I thought this movie was good but I don't
think it's one I would want to own. But thanks for reading my review and
good night!
