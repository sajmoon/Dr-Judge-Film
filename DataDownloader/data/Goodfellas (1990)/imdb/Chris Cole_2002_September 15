Some films you hear about. Others, you hear about a lot. Then there are
those which you can't stop hearing about until you have to see it. So I saw
Goodfellas. I am now happy.<br /><br />To say Goodfellas is a good film is like saying the sky is &quot;a color&quot;. The
life of Henry Hill is truly fascinating. Ray Liotta pulls it off so well,
even the real Henry Hill said he deserved the Oscar! Robert De Nero's Jimmy
&quot;The Gent&quot; Conway/Burke is simply excellent, and Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito
is something we all can remember.<br /><br />As oppose to &quot;that other mafia movie&quot; The Godfather, Goodfellas focuses on
the lives of gangsters on the lowest part of the mafia chain. The guys who
aren't even made (and in the case of Hill and Conway/Burke, can never been
made because they aren't Italian). It shows their lives as they extort money
from people, &quot;whack&quot; folks, commit one of the biggest acts of crime in
history, and have fun doing it.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for any mafia movie fan. And when you're done, turn
on HBO to get the same satisfaction from The Sopranos!
