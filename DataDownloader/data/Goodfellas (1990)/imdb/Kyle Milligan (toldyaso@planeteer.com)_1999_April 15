Like most of Martin Scorsese's films, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is an example of superior
film-making. The fact that this film is on the American Film Institute's top
100 films of all time is no surprise to me. It's low ranking of 94 is a bit
disturbing. It sits as close to the bottom as it should to the top of that
list. This film gives you a hard, long, candid look of the life of a
gangster spanning three decades, without pulling any punches.<br /><br />It is violent to be sure, but not gratuitous, unnecessary violence. How can
you tell a convincing tale of life in the mob without getting violent? The
narration by Ray Liotta and the style in which the film is presented gives
it a very realistic feel that is not easily achieved on the fantastic
subject matter. Based on the novel by Nicholas Pileggi, this is a harrowing
true story, and despite its incredible turns, we know in our hearts it's
all too real. Many scenes from this film are burned into my mind, and that
can be attributed partially to the story, but mostly to the convincing
performances by all involved.<br /><br />Joe Pesci received an Oscar for best supporting actor, but I feel Martin was
overlooked unjustly. I'm sure he doesn't make films for the sake of awards,
that appears to be the case anyway, but I'm sure the recognition wouldn't
have embarrassed him either, and it's a shame. I respect the man and his
work, and I feel that this film is his greatest so far.
