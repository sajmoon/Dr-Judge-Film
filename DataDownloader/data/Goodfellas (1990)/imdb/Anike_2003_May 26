Scorcese's Goodfellas is a well-crafted device into the very core of a
gangster.  OK putting the fact that it's based on a true story aside,
we're
also allowed into and become involved in every twist, turn, hope and
desire
in the life of Henry Hill.  Liotta is fantastic as the guy who just
'slipped' into the life of an out and out gangster.  My only gripe about
the
portrayal of this character is that we may have been led to feel a bit
more
sympathetically towards him then perhaps we should have.<br /><br />I think this is probably Pesci's monumental role.  That scene where he
pulls
Liotta's leg is at one moment sickeningly scary and at the next
screamingly
funny.<br /><br />I think what strikes me most about this film is the fragility of any real
friendship/relationship structure in this portrayal of the mob.  Everyone
seems to be a 'goodfella' but when the chips are down and something goes
wrong, who can you trust?<br /><br />
