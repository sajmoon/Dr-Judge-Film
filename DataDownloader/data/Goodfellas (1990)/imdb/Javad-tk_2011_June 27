1. The acting and the technical direction of this movie is good, but
the art is not technique only. <br /><br />2. Prate, discourtesy, mischief and villainy of Characters in this
movie are repulsive.<br /><br />3. I think this movie is mostly shallow fun and it isn&#x27;t a beautiful
and thoughtful film. <br /><br />4. I really don&#x27;t understand which fellows of this movie are good? Can
you help me?!<br /><br />5. I title this movie &#x22;Badfellas&#x22; and I think &#x22;Badfellas&#x22; is clearly
overrated and worthless.
