2001_November 28 

I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was
immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then
Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both
uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to
rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was
monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These
guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to
get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV
screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or
Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and
unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I
ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a
Scorsese flick since.
