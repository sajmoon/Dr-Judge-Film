Good Fellas! Boy was that movie a dramatic movie. It was a great Mafia
type movie, and it had an excellent movie plot to it. It was sad,
intense but also kick ass! I loved it it was just so real and made you
think deep. This movie was about coke dealers, and it really showed and
taught the meaning of a coke dealer. It showed what the men had to go
throguh, and how they dealth with their personal life. It was serouilsy
pretty sweet. If you love the classic, mafia type, with a twist, then
you will love Good Fellas. The acting wasn't too bad either. They
prtrayed the characters really good and taught me all about the life of
a smugler.
