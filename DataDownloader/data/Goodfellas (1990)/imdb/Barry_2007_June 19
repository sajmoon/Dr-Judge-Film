I absolutely ****ing love it! I watched it a couple of weeks ago for
the first time and i was captivated. Scorsese worked his magic on the
story of Henry Hill, as being a 16 year old by i have become fascinated
with. He&#39;s an Itlaian-Irish gangster and he produced in my opinion one
of the best films ever made. De Niro, Liotta and Pesci shine in the
film but i think its Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen who absolutely
steals the show, playing the Jewish girl from a quiet neighbourhood,
thrown into the world of Cocaine dealing, murders and violence. Its
undoubtedly one of my favourite films and I&#39;m sure it will be for a
long time. How the film is mainly narration is what i really love about
it, and along with the soundtrack by artists such as the Crystals and
Shangri-las, make this film amazing and brilliant to watch!
