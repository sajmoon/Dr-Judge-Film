GoodFellas is the best movie of the nineties, the best gangster movie off
all time, and my favorite move.  All the actors are so great like Robert
De
Niro and Joe Pesci.  It's full of great scenes and is so entertaining.  I
can watch it over and over again.  It's definitely Scorsese's best, with
Taxi Driver and Raging Bull really close behind.
