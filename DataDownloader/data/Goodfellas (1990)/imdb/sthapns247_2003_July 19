This is truly on of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It shows in
beautiful detail how the criminal underground works.  The story being true
only helped its accuracy.  The lead performances where perfect, especially
Liota's, he really made the movie what it is.  The transformation he goes
through is really amazing.<br /><br />The perfect balance of violence, crime, and comedy make this movie what it
is.  There are enough jokes to balance off the dead bodies and the drug
content.  And the cinematography is mind boggling.  The story is flawless
and the ending made the whole thing worth it.  It scary to think Conway will
be out of prison next year (2004)... I wonder if there will be a sequel in
like 50 years about what Conway did after he got out.<br /><br />All and all a brilliant movie that comes so close to perfection it's scary. 
It's a shame it didn't win best movie, it really was worthy in ever
light.<br /><br />9/10, easily.
