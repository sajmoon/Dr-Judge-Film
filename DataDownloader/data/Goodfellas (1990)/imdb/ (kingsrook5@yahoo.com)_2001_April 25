`Goodfellas' is a story about the glamour and allure of the mafia, told
with
the voice of nostalgic regret by Henry Hill (Ray Liota), a self proclaimed
nobody, living a safe and dreary existence in the witness protection
program.  Scorsese draws brilliant performances out of each and every one
of
his actors, scoring an Oscar nomination for Loraine Bracco (The Sopranos)
and a win for Joe Pesci.  Pesci shows us a glimpse into true evil as Tommy
DeVito, a man so caught up in power and greed that he's lost any semblance
of humanity.  Liota's performance hits the mark as well.  Each time a
murder
is committed in his presence, he has a brief moment with the camera in
which
he agonizes over the realization that it is just another part of the job.
His understated performance somehow allows the viewer to actually
sympathize
with his situation.  `Goodfellas' is about a family.  Liotta's kids know
their Don as `Uncle Pauly' and literally jump up and down with enthusiasm
at
the prospect of going to his place for dinner.  They cook together, laugh
together, and dig graves together.  Don't miss it!
