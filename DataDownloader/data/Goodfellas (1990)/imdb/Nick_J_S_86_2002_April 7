The best thing about the movie: Joe Pesci was simply amazing.  I thought it
was a good movie, but the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied.  I would put
it in my top 5 gangster movies, but I don't think it even comes close to
&quot;The Godfather&quot; or even &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; as far as mafia movies are
concerned.
