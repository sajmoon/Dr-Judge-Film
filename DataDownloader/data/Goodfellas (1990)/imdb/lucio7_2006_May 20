funny? what do you mean I&#39;m funny??<br /><br />the joyful spirit of the Italians mafia&#39;s gangsters is touchable in
this movie more than in anything movie else and.... I have to say,it&#39;s
very contagious: who,viewing this film hasn&#39;t thought for a while at
least:&quot;nothing is better than being a gangster&quot;?<br /><br />Joe Pesci gives here its best interpretation: my favorite character in
the whole cinema&#39;s history; Ray Liotta is great and De Niro is... De
Niro!<br /><br />i prefere this fithis movie really represents the airiness of the
gangsters,the joy to... you know... &quot;being part of something&quot; ;)
