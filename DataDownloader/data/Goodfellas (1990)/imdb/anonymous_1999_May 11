This movie though very good, as well as being an endless supply of
one-liners would have done well to follow the book more closely. If it
had,
people would understand that &quot;Tommy&quot;
was a COMPOSITE of many people Henry knew, and that Henry's first &quot;pinch&quot;
was for passing counterfeit 20's, not selling cigarettes.  I won't give
away
everything, but, READ the BOOK!
Also, Henry had a brief stint in the armed forces.
(Morrie WAS real, 'so forget money; Morrie's wigs don't come off!)  And...
Thank you, spider!!
