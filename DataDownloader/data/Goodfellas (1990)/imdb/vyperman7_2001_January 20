I can never get tired of watching this film. Robert Dinero, and Joe Pesci
are great.  What I do not understand is why Ray Liota's career did not take
off better.  He does a great job as Henry Hill, and he has not been in
anything exciting in a long time.  The way that this movie shows the mob and
how it works is great.  A must see!
