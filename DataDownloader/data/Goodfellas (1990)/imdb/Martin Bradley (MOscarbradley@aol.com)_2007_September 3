Some people favour &quot;Raging Bull&quot; but the biggest buzz you are likely to
get from a Scorcese movie will come from &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and because of it
his name will be indelibly linked with &#39;gangster&#39; films for evermore.
If &quot;The Godfather&quot; films, (well, parts 1 and 2 anyway), represent the
greatest single achievement in the genre taken as a whole, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
is still probably the pinnacle of the old-fashioned gangster movie per
se. It&#39;s based on fact, and by all accounts very accurately, but its
genesis lies in the Warner Brothers films of the 1930&#39;s, (which, of
course, were &#39;torn from the headlines&#39;, so to speak).<br /><br />It is the story of a life, that of Henry Hill, lived in the pursuit of
crime, seen first as a boy, (Christopher Serrone), and then as a man,
(Ray Liotta). He&#39;s one of the narrators, (the other is his wife, who
throws her own jaundiced eye on the events in her husband&#39;s life), and
it is through him we get to know a host of Runyonesque-named wise-guys
and goodfellas, (gangsters all). The difference, of course, is that
Runyon made them cuddly whereas Scorcese and his co-writer Nicholas
Pileggi, on whose book the film is based, makes them vicious. To most
of these guys killing is second nature; they don&#39;t give a moment&#39;s
thought to kicking a man to death or shooting a barhop dead for giving
back-chat. And perhaps it is that impulsiveness that is their downfall.
They can plan one of the biggest heists in US history but they can&#39;t
control their tempers.<br /><br />It is, then, a very violent, (and foul-mouthed), movie and I can see
why it won&#39;t be everybody&#39;s bucket of blood but if you love movies at
all you can&#39;t help but love &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Scorcese brings to bear on
the film a true film-maker&#39;s virtuosity; he loves the process of making
movies and it shows in every frame, in every shot. Coupled with his
innate understanding of the community in which &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is set, he
has made a masterpiece. Everyone is working at a peak here; the editor,
Thelma Schoonmaker; the cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus; the cast, as
well as Liotta, never better, De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino,
Lorraine Bracco. It could be argued that without movies like
&quot;Scarface&quot;, (the Hawks version), and &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;,
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; might not have existed. Likewise, without &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
would we ever have had &quot;The Sopranos&quot;?
