Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen
this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say &quot;sad&quot; because
it&#39;s a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in
a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I&#39;m embarrassed to say
this movie is part of my collection. That&#39;s simply because it&#39;s a
fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.<br /><br />This is a rough film, to say the least. It&#39;s not just the language;
there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci&#39;s &quot;Tommy DeVito&quot;
seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence
Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this
is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia
life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who
doesn&#39;t? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the
music; it&#39;s a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul
Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters. <br /><br />With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord&#39;s
name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising
considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a
little too rough-edged at times. I&#39;ve watched thousands of crime
movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of
the above offends you, you&#39;re in for a treat with an intense crime
story that is very watchable.
