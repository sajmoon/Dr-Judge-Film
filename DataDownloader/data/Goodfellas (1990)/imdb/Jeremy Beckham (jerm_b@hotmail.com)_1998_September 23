Goodfellas is the best Mafia/gangster movie of all time, and one of the
greatest movies ever.
One of the greatest things about Goodfellas is the very wide range of
emotions, moods, expressions, and atmosphere along with the very quick
change between them. In a way the ending leaves you with a sort strange
feeling, wondering 'should I be happy or sad?'
In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing,
happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them
killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like
that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel
especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that
every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes
the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts. I've heard
many different ways people interpreted the movie's expressions and moods,
but I always here one thing that's always the same; Goodfellas is one of the
greatest movie's of all time.
