Goodfellas has to be the greatest mob movie.from it&#39;s memorable
characters to the excellent plot that is called a classic.he&#39;re is why
it is called a classic.<br /><br />The movie is focused on Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who when he was young he
wanted to become a gangster and he becomes one from the mob by doing
thing like selling cigarettes,Blowing up cars,delivering
packages,etc.soon enough he meets Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro).who
becomes friends with Henry helps him when he&#39;s on one of his jobs.soon
enough Tommy Devito(Joe Pesci)comes into Henry&#39;s life and become friend
but unlike Henry.Tommy was more violent than Jimmy and Henry put
together.Henry even though at first he enjoys the mob life but
evenutally Henry&#39;s mob life goes upside down and bad things start to
happened to him.<br /><br />This movie has a good plot with memorable character at the same time
Great performances.Robert De Niro who plays Jimmy &quot;the Gent&quot; Conway
give a great performance he really watches out for Tommy and Henry and
proves he can still be dangerous.Joe Pesci gives the best performance
he plays the violent Tommy Devito.who loves hurting people and gets a
laugh a hurting other for example the scene where the guys are playing
poker Tommy gets into a fight with a bartender and shoots him in the
foot.then the next time they play poker again he starts to insult him
but the bartender defense himself and Jimmy gives the bartender gives
him props from insulting Tommy he asks Tommy what&#39;s he&#39;s going to do
Tommy pulls his gun and shoots and kills the bartender.In some way you
got to hate Tommy but at time you got to love him.Ray Liotta who Henry
Hill even though he&#39;s the main character and gives a solid performance
but nothing really memorable maybe it was that at the time Ray Liotta
wasn&#39;t an experience actor but he does a good job playing Henry
Hill.Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen Hill Henry tormented Wife is more
memorable than Henry with her paranoia of her husband cheating at her
but the best scene where she really shines is when she loads a gun at
threatens to Kill Henry but can&#39;t because she still loves Henry and she
pulls it off well and making her role believable.as for the rest of the
characters even though there not defiled like the main characters they
still give a good job with what there given.<br /><br />Still if you haven&#39;t seen this movie go get it it&#39;s a special movie.
