Martin Scorsese has made some of the most enduring American films of
the last 30 years, and Goodfellas still stands one of his very best.
Arguably the best film of the 90's,Goodfellas delivers laughs, thrills,
shocks, and a great soundtrack of pop music ranging three decades. As
with any Scorsese film, the acting is top-notch, especially from Liotta
and Academy Award winner Pesci. And as with any Scorsese film, there's
brutal violence abound. Goodfellas is definitely one of the best
gangster films ever, and it's also a vivid look into an era that once
was. On top of all that, it's my all-time favorite film. You can't ask
for anything else from a movie than what Scorsese's masterpiece
delivers. 10/10
