 When Martin Scorsese reunited with two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro for
the sixth time, it turned out to be one of the most powerful films of all
time. There were superb performances in this excellent film. Mostly the one
who did good was from Joe Pesci here as Tommy DeVito. He was very funny even
in the &quot;You Think I'm Funny&quot; scene. He truly deserved that Academy Award.
The first time that I saw this film was back a few years ago and I thought
it was a good film. In fact, my dad saw it and he like it so much that he
bought it on DVD. The best song in this film was the piano version of
&quot;Layla&quot;. Any body who saw this film either sang to the lyrics or dance to
the beat. I think that Bobby De Niro and Marty Scorsese once again worked
beautifully well in this film. They have been friends for a long time. They
collaborated in 8 films. And the results were outstanding. Do me a favor. If
you haven't seen this film then SEE IT!
