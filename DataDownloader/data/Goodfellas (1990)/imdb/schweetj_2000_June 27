This is one of my favorite films of all time! Yes, it's up there with
Godfather II and Usual Suspects. DeNiro is superb (as always) Liotta is
great, too. The story is awesome (well, I'm a sucker for crime movies, what
can I say). The Mafia is just very interesting to me. If you haven't yet
seen this film, do yourself a favor and go rent this bad boy
tonite!
