The Godfather series never rang completely true, with its glamorized
portrayal of noblesse oblige within the criminal underworld. GoodFella's
does with its portrayal of petty criminals and psychopaths who's noblesse
is completely self serving and without compassion in dealing with anything
that comes in their way. Deniro and Pesci are brilliant in their roles as
wise guys (sociopath and psychopath respectively). Ray Liotta is good as a
small time hood with a bit of heart who deals drugs and turns informer. His
role is probably more sympathetic than is the real Henry Hill on whom the
character is based, but it does provide an emotional bridge for the audience
into a world of brutality, retribution, greed and treachery. A very well
constructed movie.
