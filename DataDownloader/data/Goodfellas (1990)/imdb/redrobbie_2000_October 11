Scorcese's film is a true classic. It's blend of superb acting and
directorial flair manages to make the story highly realistic. In the
beginning we like Henry are seduced by the gangster but by the end of the
movie our opinion on gangster life changes dramatically. A gritty hard
hitting movie that eclipses all others.
