I really suspect that I didn't properly understand this film. I'm a fan
of
gangster movies, and ironically Casino is one of my favourite films, but
I
really thought this was trash.<br /><br />It has one simple problem: the main characters, with the possible
exception
of De Niro's, just aren't intimidating. Joe Pesci's in particular is a
squeaky-voiced midget, and all are hopelessly incompetent morons. Are we
really supposed to believe that these idiots, alternately irritating and
clueless, work their way up through ranks of brutal, remorseless killers
and
thieves? Pah.<br /><br />I give the actors credit for trying hard, but they're wrestling with
two-dimensional scenarios and a one-dimensional script throughout. In one
memorable scene, three foot tall, mickey-mouse voiced &quot;unpedictable
maniac&quot;
Tommy De Vito (Pesci) rants, &quot;But, I'm funny how? Funny like a clown? I
amuse you? I make you laugh? I'm here to fuckin' amuse you?&quot;. Luckily,
Henry
Hill, the pimply faced runty butt of his joke is the sort of &quot;hardened
gangster&quot; who throws up at the sight of a dead body, and so Tommy doesn't
get the punch in the face he so richly deserves. Ooooh what gritty
realism.<br /><br />Garbage. Nothing out of ten.
