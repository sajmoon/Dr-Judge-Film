this is easily martin Scorsese&#x27;s best mafia movie. i don&#x27;t care if
no-one agrees with me on this one. also the soundtrack is stunning,
apart from scarface i think the best gangster soundtrack ever. the
scene where sunshine of your love by cream is playing is just one of
the top 10 DE niro moments(with 1 being taxi driver mirror
monologue!!). and the other scene with Eric Clapton&#x27;s Layla part 2 is
brilliant. it just makes it so authentic!!!. exaclty what Scorsese is
the master of.<br /><br />&#x22;never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut!&#x22;. Jimmy
