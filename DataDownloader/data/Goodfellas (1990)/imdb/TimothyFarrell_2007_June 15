&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the defining movies of the 90s and with good
reason. While many of the films from this decade that were hailed as
classics are incredibly overrated, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; completely deserves its
status. Believe what you&#39;ve heard, it really is a masterpiece and
essential viewing for film buffs. I wouldn&#39;t call it Scorcese&#39;s best
(that&#39;d be &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; or &quot;Raging Bull&quot;), but he really is an expert
craftsman working at his best here. No other director could make this
epic mob tale work so well. Hes tried to replicate this success many
times, occasionally with interesting results (&quot;The Departed&quot;), but he&#39;s
yet to top what hes achieved here. In fact, I actually prefer this
slightly to &quot;The Godfather&quot;. That&#39;s a masterpiece as well, but the
character development here is a bit stronger and there&#39;s more of a
sweeping and strongly emotional feel.<br /><br />As great as Scorcese&#39;s direction is, you need great performances to
make this kind of film work. Fortunately, he had an incredibly skilled
cast to work with to create some memorable characters. Ray Liotta, a
performer I find usually to be rather wooden, is really good. Even
better however are Robert DeNiro, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci. Pesci
in particular creates a psychotic and seemingly unlikable character and
manages to make the audience care for him. The screenplay doesn&#39;t have
good or bad guys, as each character are presented as fully developed
human beings.<br /><br />All this talent comes together to produce a film on a level few have
reached. Ultimately, the story is what matters the most here, and
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the most compelling screen stories of all time.
It may possibly be the greatest mob movie of all time. It was highly
influential, and even though many came close (&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; in
particular), nothing has yet to top it for this style of epic. (10/10)
