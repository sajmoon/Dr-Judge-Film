I have been watching this movie since it was first released and I don't
think I'll ever tire of it. The characters,storylines and acting is
completely amazing and, like The Godfather,it won't date. Ray Liotta has
never been the same since and he showed a would be promising acting career
but now wallows in 'Supporting Actor' category.Lorraine Bracco and Paul
Sorvino are amazing as the supporting actors but it's really Deniro,Pesci
and Liottas movie. Sometimes it's brutal,sometimes it's funny but it never
looses the bite for the whole duration of the movie. This is my favourite
movie and it has been for 10 years.It would take some beating for me to
change my mind.If you haven't seen it,turn your computer off and get it
out!!!!
