1998_October 29 

Martin Scorsese was gifted with talent from above.  Just thinking about
certain scenes in this masterpiece gives me goose-bumps.  Best scene is when
Karen and Henry enter the Copa from the basement..a long, LONG shot with a
cut...just perfect.
I hope I live long enough to see Scorsese win an Oscar.
