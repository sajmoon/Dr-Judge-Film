The best mobster film in my opinion. I love the Godfather but this is
just so much more fun to watch. When I mean fun I mean I can&#x27;t take my
eyes off this fn thing every time it comes on or someone&#x27;s watching it.
If there is one movie that never ever ever ever gets boring i would
have to say that it&#x27;s these guys the Goodfellas you know. There&#x27;s
nothing to really say about this film i mean you just have to see it,
I&#x27;m just writing &#x27;cause I want the score to show up on MY MOVIES over
here. It&#x27;s entertainment at it&#x27;s very best. You want a true story
Goodfellas, you want crime Goodfellas, you want clever jokes still
Goodfellas. The only downside is, after watching this film, you really
get this urge to join the mafia and live a life of crime, you know, be
a Goodfella.
