Machavelli would have been proud of GoodFellas. No characters are
glorified or given unreal motives for their actions. This movie is not
driven by fantasy or great one-liners, yet it is totally engrossing. The
violence is sickening but motivated. These men are ruthless, they are not
characters in a movie jockeying for attention. They are pure Machavelli,
what is expedient is necessarily right. In this life, if it is more
convenient to have you dead... watch your back and never trust your friends
especially if they are smiling.<br /><br />This is the real Mafia; life at its most dangerous. A complex game where
everything is for sale and anyone is expendable. Whatever works is right.
Machavelli himself couldn't have a better movie demonstrating his
theories.
