After renting the first three seasons of The Sopranos, I decided to
rent Goodfellas, a film I had heard and read so many good things about.
After watching the movie, I was a bit disappointed. The beginning of
the film worked well for me - one could really get in the head of young
Henry and understand what turned him on to the wise guy life. I loved
the detail in the first third of the film. The storytelling took a bad
turn for me, though. Everything after his marriage seemed to spiral out
of a personal reality and into a &quot;this happened, and then that
happened, and then that...&quot; form of storytelling. The last third just
moved too fast for me; I lost my connection to the characters and by
the time the end credits rolled around I wasn't connected to the
gravity of what was going on. All in all, Goodfellas is a good film,
but it is not the mob classic I was expecting it to be.
