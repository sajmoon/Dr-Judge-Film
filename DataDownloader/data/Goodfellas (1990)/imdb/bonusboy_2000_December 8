Martin Scorsese's master craftmanship his is exquisite in every scene.
What
Marti does here is take 5 actors, weave them into the backdrop of
true-life
mob-rat Henry Hill, and produce each actors finest ever performace in one
film.
Liotta, Pesci, Vincent, De Niro, Sorvino are terrific here, as are the
rest
of the 'fellas.
I once heard that every scene in a Scorsese film is included for a reason
and in this film every scene can be watched on its own as a masterpiece.
I
love the bit where Henry takes his Karen to have dinner and the camera
follows them through the kitchens, the bouncers and until they are finally
seated.  However, my favourite scene is where the 'fellas decide to whack
Maurice, and you see de niro smoking his cigar at the bar.
This film also shows the best cocaine-fuelled narcosis ever in cinema, and
perhaps the best meal ever-prepared (in Jail, and at Henry's
house).
Finally, its good to see the de niro, Pesci, Vincent, Scorcese
partnership,
continuing mouth-watering films such as Raging Bull and Casino.  All in
all,
Scorsese's, De Niro's and Pesci's best.<br /><br />10/10
