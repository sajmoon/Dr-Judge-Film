Martin Scorsese&#39;s name under a movie is far beyond enough to watch it
without asking further questions.But imagine a kind-of-modern gangster
movie starring world&#39;s pioneer actors &quot;Robert de niro&quot; and &quot;Joe pesci&quot;
and others such as &quot;ray liotta&quot; and &quot;paul sorvino&quot; gathering all
together with martin Scorsese who is undoubtedly master of gangster
genre and dialogs (one of the reasons why Joe pesci won an Oscar for
his performance)to make- in my opinion -the best gangster movie ever
produced in the history of Hollywood. Apart from performances which are
excessively good! it has a very powerful and smooth story and screen
play ,easy to follow (unlike miller&#39;s crossing or once upon a time in
America) that keep you glued to your seat all the way to the end. i&#39;d
like to recommend this masterpiece to every one who is not only in
favor of gangster genre but also mesmerized by the world of movies and
movie making
