This movie was so incredibly well made and even though it did not win best
picture there are GoodFellas Fanatics (like myself) while Dances With the
Wolves has faded from out memories.
The movie goes through the life of Henry Hill (Liotta). It starts off with
Hill as a child who &quot;would rather be a gangster than the president of the
United States&quot; We meet Tommy (Pesci) Jimmy Conway (Robert Deniro) who would
root for the bad guys in the movies. We meey Pauly (Sorvino), and the whole
gangster family: &quot;Jimmy 'Two Times' who got his name because he said
everything twice. 'I'm gonna go get the papers, get the
papers.&quot;
This movie is funny at times but not haha funny. The movie has Romance,
Drama, and oh yes the genre Scorcessi perfected, &quot;Crime&quot;
