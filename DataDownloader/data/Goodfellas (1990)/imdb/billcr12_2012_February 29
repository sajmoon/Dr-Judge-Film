Goodfellas is an adaptation of a true life book by Nicholas Pileggi
detailing the life of Henry Hill. Ray Liotta as Hill is a good choice.
Beginning in Brooklyn in the 1950s, we follow this high school drop out
from his start as a petty criminal involved in hijackings to the Air
France robbery in the 1960s. <br /><br />Henry gets deeper and deeper intoned mob life, including moving a dead
body to avoid discovery by the police. After a stint in prison, Hill
becomes a drug dealer and subsequently starts using large amounts of
cocaine. Narcotics agents catch him and after ending up back in prison,
he has to make tough choices given to him by the F.B.I. Th e supporting
cast, especially Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro are terrific. The film is
a bit long at almost 2 1/2 hours but worth your time.
