Well - here it goes..
In my area everyone &quot;loves&quot; the mob way of life.. Everyone loves &quot;The
Sopranos&quot; and I also find it enjoyable to watch a great mob movie and then
imagine for a minute that Im a part of it..
For most of my life there has been only one movie to even speak of when it
came to this subject - The Godfather Epic. For those of you not familiar
with
it it was the Godfather Parts I and II edited in chronological order..
I've
seen it several times and to this day my Dad still thinks that this is the
best mob story ever told..<br /><br />But With all due respect..<br /><br />I just watched Goodfellas for the 12th time and - There is no doubt in my
mind that Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever made..<br /><br />The story starts off during the Golden Age of Organizied Crime 1955
Brooklyn
NY. A young Henry Hill is intrigued by the mob way of life - and let's be
honest - why not !?.. They have it all - respect, wealth, and
power..
Everything about the movie at this point is made to &quot;romance&quot; you about
the
era.. The music, the cinematography, work so well together..its quite rare
that a film can make you actually &quot;feel&quot; a part of it.. Goodfellas
succeeds
at this..
We meet all sorts of characters who add to the environment. Henry as he
learns the ropes also decribes to the viewer how it works.. And just about
the time your ready to stand-up and declare you wanna be a &quot;wiseguy&quot; When
things are going so good -<br /><br />Goodfellas smacks you right in the face and says - Whaddasamatta with
you..<br /><br />The deceit, the lying, the overall evil that consumes these people is
staggering.. The movie shows that in the mob there is no love, no
loyality,
no care - even amonst themselves.. The biggest mistake the mob made was to
include drugs into its &quot;business&quot;.<br /><br />Goodfellas exceeds the Godfather because of the feeling of inclusion you
feel when watching it, it surrounds you and makes you feel like a part of
the film.. I felt it's direction, and cinematography, and editing style
are
second to none.. This is Scorese and DeNiro's best film together..Raging
Bull was great too but Casino was pale over this one -  Liotta was
wonderful
although he hasnt done much since.. and Pesci's best is My Cousin Vinny
but
his &quot;Tommy&quot; is very good - deserving of the Oscar that year - even though
you wouldnt want to know him.<br /><br />If your a fan of mob storys in general see if you can spot two Sopranos
guys
in the movie ! Also look for Samuel L Jackson in a bit part..
