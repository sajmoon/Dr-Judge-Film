Another great mafia film classic. If you have read my review of The
Godfather I said it is the greatest mafia film, well this is the
second. It is based on the book Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi which is the
true story of gangster Henry Hill and his friends James Burke and
Thomas DeSimone from 1955-1980. It is directed by Martin Scorsese(Taxi
Driver,The Departed,Shutter Island) and stars Ray
Liotta(Hannibal,Identity,Smokin&#x27; Aces) Robert De Niro(The Godfather
Part II,Raging Bull,Casino) Joe Pesci(Raging Bull,Home Alone,Casino)
Lorraine Bracco(Radio Flyer,The Basketball Diaries,The Sopranos) and
Paul Sorvino(Law &#x26; Order,Romeo + Juliet,The Cooler). The direction is
great so is the acting especially from De Niro and Pesci
