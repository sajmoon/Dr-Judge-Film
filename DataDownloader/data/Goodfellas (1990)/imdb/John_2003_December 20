Nothing compares to the perplexing feelings you get as you find yourself
feeling &quot;good&quot; as this group of narcissistic scummy psychotic social
deviates rampage across the screen committing every vile act
imaginable.<br /><br />But still, it's a good feeling, good flowing, goodfella
movie!<br /><br />I watch this frequently because I never tire of the phenomenal acting, the
wonderful narration, and the fantastic music!
