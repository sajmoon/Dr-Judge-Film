First and foremost, much as many so-called film conosieurs would like to
think, Martin Scorsese is not an underground name anymore - and Goodfellas
marked his departure from exclusive to mainstream alternative.<br /><br />Try to forget the urban chique that now surrounds Goodfellas and watch with
a mind to experience the visceral nature of this brilliant film.  Don't
think of it on terms of whats 'cool' or what 'happens'; but why and how
these events are occuring.<br /><br />Just try to experience Goodfellas from the perpective it was intended -of
Henry Hill, not of a comfortable arm chair perspective where what is, in
fact sickening violence and abuse, can appear as glorified and entertaining.
 Imagine it was you who were at risk and apply this to Scorsese's
in-your-face-approach.<br /><br />Joe Pesci is amazing in this film, and once again DeNiro commands each and
every moment he does not share with Pesci, with total charisma and
power.<br /><br />The benchmark to which many Scorsese and other gangster films will be
measured, for years to come, and a certified part of popular
culture.<br /><br />Stunning.
