Where do I begin with &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;? How do I start off my review for a
movie that is absolutely mind-blowing.A movie that is gritty and dirty,
yet beyond entertaining at the same time.Can a movie possibly be this
good? When it comes to this movie, it is possible.I was left astonished
when the end credits were over.I was left thinking &#x22;Wow! What a great
film!&#x22;. I am not over-reacting here folks.I am not trying to compete
with another movie.I am telling you the truth.If you have not seen this
film, then there is no point in talking to you.This Martin Scorsese
film is an exhilarating piece of American filmaking that&#x27;s well
directed, well acted, and well constructed.The only other film that
I&#x27;ve seen from Martin is &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22;, which was another great
movie, despite what some critics said.I feel that I must warn you: This
is an extremely gritty and dirty mafia movie.Swearing and violence run
rampant in this film, so viewers who can&#x27;t stand brutal beatings and
four-letter words being uttered out every 5 seconds are going to be in
for a depressing experience.But that&#x27;s not the point.How much do you
think the real life Mafia swear and murder? That&#x27;s what I thought.As
explicit this movie is, It&#x27;s also an Oscar worthy sensation.Joe Pesci
really steals the show here.De Nero and Liotta are good, but Pesci
brings the thunder here.Do not miss this movie.If you see it on the
shelf, but it.Steal it if you have to.Just be sure to witness what may
be one of the greatest crime-dramas of all time! No joke.
