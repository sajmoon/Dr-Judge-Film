I'm not a big fan of picking out &quot;best&quot; films, but I've got to say that
this
is possibly my best film of all time.<br /><br />There are superb performances from Pesci, De Niro, and Liotta, and it's
one
of the few films I can watch again and again, as there's always something
new.<br /><br />I strongly recommend watching this.
