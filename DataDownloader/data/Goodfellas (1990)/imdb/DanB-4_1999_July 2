1999_July 2 

Well, it's between Goodfellas, Schindler's List and Fargo for the best of
the 90's, but IMHO, this is it. This movie stays with you and effects you
in
ways that few if any films do. Every scene is perfect, every shot works -
it
is brilliantly written and is another master work of editing by Thelma
Schoonmaker. Its loss of the Best Picture Oscar to Dances with Wolves (of
all movies) is the 2nd greatest scandal in Oscar History (next to the
shutout of The Color Purple).<br /><br />It is its attention to detail and Scorsese's ability to pick the exact,
singularly perfect song for each shot that makes this film so great. Take
the scene for example, of Robert DeNiro, sitting at the bar, silent,
smoking
a cigarette, essentially contemplating who to kill. As the shot slowly
zooms
in on him, I defy anyone to find better music than &quot;Sunshine of Your Love'
to complete that gripping scene. Or even more so, the playing of Sid
Vicious' slaughtering of &quot;My Way&quot; over the closing credits.<br /><br />Pesci, Liotta, Deniro, Bracco and Sorvino (in the best role of his career)
are stunning, but this is Martin Scorsese's triumph. He will be viewed
upon
one day (likely after his death) as the greatest ever American Director.
He
has four absolute masterpieces to his name, and not a single bad film.
This,
however, is the apex of his career.<br /><br />Goodfellas is not about anything other than life in a crew - being on the
inside. The guilt, the pride, the easy life, the paranoia, the forced
laughter, the constant fear and the struggle to lie correctly when asked a
tough question. In the famous scene with Paulie (Sorvino) asking Henry
(Liotta) about the killing of a made guy from another crew, I have always
believed that Paulie knows the truth and wants Henry to lie, but has to
ask
the question because it is expected of him. Not a direct question, just
&quot;Whaddya know about that thing?&quot;.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a gift to moviegoers - one that should be enjoyed over and
over again. It is violent and it does have more f-shots than any movie I
can
recall. It is edgy and uneasy and it will get right under your skin and
make
it crawl. But it is also infectious and addictive at the same time. The
Canadian Cable Channel Bravo often plays this uncut and commercial free
late
at night and I find myself awake at 4 am watching it, even though I own
the
video.<br /><br />The closing scene of this movie is probably the greatest sustained piece
of
filmmaking I have ever scene - Henry must sell some guns, close a drug
deal,
cook some pasta sauce, juggle his wife and girlfriend and outrun some
pesky
helicopters all in a fit of increasing paranoia. As the world closes in on
Henry, it closes in on you and you want to squirm out. You know why Henry
made his final decision.<br /><br />Absolutely perfect. **** out of ****.
