If there's one thing Goodfellas it criticsed for, its the lack of definite
storyline, since it follows more of a documentary style of gangster life
than it does a plot. Yet each scene is so engaging, so beautifully acted and
includes such top-knotch script writing that you will forget that aspect and
become drawn into individually sections. Because, after all, this film aimed
to depict the mafia lifestyle, it was never an action or thriller-based
story. The random violence that occurs and brilliant narration throughout
only serve to further enhance the entire image the film gets across. The
character relationships are also cleverly forged together, and the
unpredictable nature of the film allows you to hinge nicely throughout and
keeps you in suspense. 
Perhaps this film is not for everyone, if you like a proper storyline you
may be disappointed, but this film is pure genius since it followed- and
achieved what it set out to do- shock and exploit the very innards of
gangster life. 
Now become the don and watch it :D
