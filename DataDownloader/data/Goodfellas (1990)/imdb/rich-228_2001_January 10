This film is undoubtedly the best gangster movie I've seen.  All the
principals - Scorcese as director, De Niro, Liotta, Pesci are at their best
here.  The movie is also unfortunately full of 4 letter words and
unbelievably violent scenes, but that's part of the reality of the Mafia
underworld the film portrays.  Full of fine little touches - my favorites
are the characters Frankie Two Times and Johnny Roast Beef.
