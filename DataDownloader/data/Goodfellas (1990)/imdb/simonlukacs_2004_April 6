Brutal, bombastic, balletic, brilliant. Lots of things beginning with B.
More fun than Raging Bull, funnier than Taxi Driver and more stylish than
Mean Streets. Music, acting, cinematography, script - all present and top
notch. Liotta is a revelation, Joe Pesci never better and De Niro is...
well, he's De Niro. Scorsese's account of the life of mobster turned
informant Henry Hill (Liotta) has class seeping from every frame. In a
world
populated by beautiful observed minor characters, with a pace that rarely
slows and never stops and set piece after glorious set piece, not a moment
of the camera's attention is wasted. Words cannot sum up it's greatness.
Scorsese's legacy will be this film. Pure genius!
