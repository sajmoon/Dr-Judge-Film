*WARNING* REVIEW CONTAINS ONE CASE OF BAD LANGUAGE *WARNING*<br /><br />'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster,'
says Henry Hill, who opens his true story of 30 years in the mob in
Scorsese's epic <br /><br />There has never been an adequate explanation as to why this superb
gangster epic didn't win 1990's Best Picture Academy Award. And why a
film featuring 20 minutes of buffaloes stampeding and Kevin Costner
with a 'tache (Dances With Wolves) was considered more worthy than one
that featured Pesci's memorable 'How the f**k am I funny?' tirade is
anyone's guess.<br /><br />Glaring goofs by the Academy aside, GoodFellas is one of the best
gangster movies ever. The tale of 30 years of life in the Mob, as seen
through the eyes of real-life gangster Henry Hill (Liotta), was based
on Nicolas Pileggi's gripping book (which he and Martin Scorsese
adapted for the screen) and directed with skill by Scorsese. <br /><br />There are so many things about this movie that are great - the casting
of De Niro as Hill's mentor and Pesci (who won an Oscar) as the
psychotic Tommy, that infamous tracking shot as Henry and his date
(Bracco) walk into the Copacabana restaurant, the soundtrack featuring
everything from Tony Bennett to The Who - it's no real surprise that
the movie regularly appears on critics' Top Ten lists. Gripping,
beautifully written, brilliantly directed, funny and tragic all in one
- it certainly deserves to be right up there.
