Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry
Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand
boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life
when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By
this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his
whole social life &#150; from his friends, his wife, his job to his values &#150;
he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and
given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels
strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on
the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: &quot;I remember seeing
it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look
like.&quot; <br /><br />To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry
around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant
diversions, as is Scorsese&#39;s style. It invests the whole film in a
behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a
long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of
steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and
Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where
they are pampered by Henry&#39;s connections. It&#39;s raw and unflinching and
truly absorbs you in Henry&#39;s life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia
hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time
whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine
Bracco) &#150; the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta
fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient
voice-over narrative flow. <br /><br />This flow is the film&#39;s fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely
enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his
wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of
whom are equally charismatic characters &#150; the latter with rapid-fire
dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his
colourful performance. It&#39;s all compelling at first BUT as is the usual
mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It&#39;s like he got so taken
with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own
self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose
than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run.
It is true that some of them are important for establishing the
atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from
patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and
diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.<br /><br />I cannot figure out whether this &#39;diluting the film&#39; approach is
Scorsese&#39;s style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every
film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without
any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time.
Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes
a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that
snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek
heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular
music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert
skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed
in the characters&#39; lives of crime that you know of nothing else. <br /><br />As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and
not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with
Lorraine Bracco&#39;s performance as Henry&#39;s Jewish wife &#150; whose kickass
attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The
greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the
big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of
the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the
whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that
they aren&#39;t acting like their characters; they are behaving like them.
Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could
be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin
Scorsese&#39;s long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.<br /><br />8 out of 10
