I&#x27;ve watched Godfellas six times, and every time I watch it I find out
something new. You know, this is the movie of the 90&#x27;s, by far the best
Gangster movie after GodFather.<br /><br />The cast is great, De Niro is at his best, Lliota does his job pretty
well, but the greatest actor of this movie is Joe Pesci. You like his
character (Tommy De Vito) even thought you want him to die. Scorsese is
a great director, everyone knows, but in GodFellas he is AT HIS BEST.<br /><br />The history is very well crafted, and there is no &#x22;useless&#x22; scenes,
every scene has it own paper. The soundtrack is pretty good too, the
most memorable is on Billy Batts scene! If you have never watched
Godfellas, GO WATCH IT NOW! For me, it deserves a 10/10
