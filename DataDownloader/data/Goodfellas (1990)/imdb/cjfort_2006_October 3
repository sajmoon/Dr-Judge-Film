An incredible movie by none other than Martin Scorsese is, as you would
have to have guessed, this one. Though, not as good as the first two
parts of the Godfather, still in that are. With amazing cast, story
(based on true events), and direction makes a wonderful viewing
experience.<br /><br />Though I do have a little bit of a thing for the string violence and
intense situations, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean this isn&#39;t enjoyable
for everyone else. By the contrary! No, this can be enjoyed by anyone
who doesn&#39;t mind:<br /><br />A). Violence (against wife, and others, resulting half the time in
death). B). Drugs (in the last hour, but still...). C). language (and
LOTS of it; the Trivia says the &#39;F&#39; word is used 246 times).<br /><br />Other than THAT, it&#39;s not too bad. One of the best movies I&#39;ve ever
seen.<br /><br />Rating: **** (of 4)<br /><br />Entertainment: ***** (of 5)
