     Goodfellas is one of the few films that is just made for narration.
Liotta's commentary makes the film exciting, moving and is told well. The
film is made from a contrast from 'The Godfather', where the leadership of
the mafia is examined. In 'Goodfellas' we see the world through a hood at
the bottom of the ladder, and how he relates to life in general over 20
years. Liotta is excellent, as is De Niro, but for me the standout
performance was from Joe Pesci, who is just scary as the pscychopathic
'Tommy'. This film deserves a top 20 place on imdb.9/10
