Herny Hill (Christopher Serrone) grows up during the 1950&#39;s, who grows
up in the neighborhood of New York City in the tough and roughest
areas. But Herny becomes fascinated, when he&#39;s hired to do small time
jobs for the local mob. Which Herny is certainly loyal and these
Wiseguys do treat him with respect as well. When Herny becomes a man
(Now Played by Ray Liotta), he becomes a small time gangster by doing
various of jobs for them during the 1960&#39;s to the early 1980&#39;s. Herny
becomes close with two friends, who are also in the mob. Well Respected
Gangster James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Conway (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Robert DeNiro) and
ambitious slightly crazy Wiseguy Tom DeVito (Oscar-Winner:Joe Pesci)
are pulling off various successful jobs until the things aren&#39;t not
what they used to be. Especially when the law are trying to find a way
to put these mobsters in jail. Especially when these men are slowly
falling apart.<br /><br />Directed by Oscar-Winner:Martin Scorsese (The Aviator, The Departed,
Taxi Driver) made an entertaining Gangster film that is fast-paced,
filled with vivid rich characters, often funny and violent movie. This
is actually based on the life of the real Herny Hill. The real-life
Hill once lived that dangerous life as it is shown in the film. Liotta
gives an terrific performance here, which it is one of his best roles.
Scorsese&#39;s scores a terrific supporting cast like DeNiro, Pesci,
Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and more. Pesci won an Oscar for his
brilliant violent comedic supporting role. Bracco also received an
Oscar nomination for her strong supporting performance as well. It also
received nomination for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Director and
Best Adapated Screenplay. This is one these pictures that becomes an
Instant Classic like most of Scorsese&#39;s interesting movies and it also
an rich soundtrack. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts and
cameos, especially the director&#39;s mother. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a extremely
well directed movie that gets better and better with each viewing.
Don&#39;t miss it. Based on a novel by Nicolas Pileggi (Casino). Screenplay
by Pileggi and Scorsese. (**** &frac12;/*****).
