I don't care what movie Ray Liotta ever acts in again. To me, he will
ALWAYS be Henry Hill (or as the character Tommy DeVito says in the
movie &quot;Hendry&quot;).<br /><br />I can never get past his performance in this movie, his best in my
opinion. I love his narration over much of the movie. The screenplay is
amazing. Also enjoyed the wonderful acting by De Niro, who is amazing
as Jimmy Conway (who &quot;roots for the bad guys in movies&quot;) and Pesci, the
loose cannon Tommy DeVito, among many others. The dialogue is awesome,
with so many great lines that I know by heart, especially by the
somewhat domesticated, somewhat wild Karen Hill, played by Lorraine
Bracco (&quot;You got some nerve standing me up. Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?&quot;). I loved her approach to
convince her husband she needs more money to go shopping. Loved, loved,
loved the soundtrack, too. You can feel the different decades covered
in this movie, between the clothes, the music, the hair. Obviously
wonderful direction under Scorsese, Goodfellas is one of the greatest
movies ever made!
