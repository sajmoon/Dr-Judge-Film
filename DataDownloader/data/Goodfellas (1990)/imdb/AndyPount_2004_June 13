Goodfellas is the best gangster film ever made and that is quite a statement
with other class gangster films such as The Godfather 1 and 2 not 3 as it is
terrible, Casino, Once upon a time in America etc but it is true the film
isn't just about gangsters killing other people because they didnt get there
money, it has it all, Love, Life etc. <br /><br />What makes the film all that even better is Ray Liotta i think he is a
underated actor and is in this film also because people expect Robert Deniro
and Joe Pesci to be the main characters but Liotta turns out to be the main
character and the best actor in the film as he fits the part of a gangster
he even sounds like one i mean his narrating throughout the film keeps you
listening and watching the film. The way in which the film goes through the
years also is good as you see the different clothes worn at the time and the
music played at the particular time <br /><br />9.9999999/10 superb movie   
See also City of God, Donnie Brasco
