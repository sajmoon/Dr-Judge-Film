2003_February 1 

Without going into too much detail here, I'd just like to say that this
movie is as much about the life in the mafia as our own lives.  This movie
goes into great detail to exemplify just how little and irrelevant most of
us are in this corrupt world.<br /><br />Overall a great movie that goes through a lot of stages, packed with
action,
suspense, emotions as well as some good old laughs.  Lots of very solid
characters in there, all of them played very well, by the very best and
directed by the best, could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />This movie is so good, it demands the viewer to watch it in a suit. Highly
recommended, 10 out of 10 .
