2009_June 3 
There are several good plot synopses up already, so I&#x27;ll avoid that and
just say what I liked and didn&#x27;t about it. Maybe the few people who
haven&#x27;t seen it will appreciate this.<br /><br />So apparently this is the one that re-started fascination with the mob.
I like how different it was from Godfather. They say it influenced the
Sopranos. I can see a little of that, but to me is just not quite as
satisfying.<br /><br />Liotta, Brocco, Pesci and the rest of the gang are all great in this
movie. It&#x27;s cool because of Henry--Liotta--&#x27;s outside perspective. I
dig how it&#x27;s not exactly easy being a mobster either. It&#x27;s never quite
as glamorous as it seems, and on top of that, the crazy fellas who are
in that business are crazy enough to turn on you at any time. Pesci&#x27;s
famous &#x22;Funny how?...Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?&#x22; is classic for good
reason.<br /><br />Still, Scorsese has this weird obsession with making at least the last
45 minutes seem like a video for 70s AM radio greatest hits. It really
gets in the way of the movie for me...big time. (I&#x27;m a musician by
trade, so I love music. It&#x27;s not a prejudice. The songs chosen here are
all cool songs too, just way too loud and pervasive.) The big lessons
aren&#x27;t quite so big in this one either. That&#x27;s fine, but you expect a
little more from this crew. On the other hand, maybe that should be
seen as refreshing. And in a lot of ways it is.<br /><br />I would recommend it for anyone who wants a lighter mob movie, and one
that seems oddly more realistic because of the domestic issues. Also,
the time frame helps it stand out in a cool way. It&#x27;s very good, no
doubt.
