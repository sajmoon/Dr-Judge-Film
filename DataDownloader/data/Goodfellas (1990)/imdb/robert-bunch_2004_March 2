Of all the mob movies ever made I would have to say that Goodfellas
surpasses them all. Besides having an all star cast, it also marked some
outstanding performances. Robert Deniro who shares the title of mob movie
king with Al Pacino was no less than perfect. And Ray Liotta played a part
which I don't believe anybody else could have played. Not to mention Joe
Pesci playing the crazy yet funny S.O.B. Where as a lot of mob movies are
long and can sometimes be a little boring, Goodfellas keeps you interested
the whole time. This was truly a Martin Scorsese masterpiece and believe
me
when I say that if i ever met him I would say that to him. and I must say
that Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite flicks.
