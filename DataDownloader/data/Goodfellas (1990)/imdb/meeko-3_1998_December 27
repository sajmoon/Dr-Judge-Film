This has definitely got to be the
definitive gangster movie of our time.
Although the Godfather gave us
gangster films as a genre, Goodfellas
elevates them to masterpiece level.<br /><br />For me personally, Joe Pesci became my
favorite actor with his Oscar winning
performance in this film.  A must see,
Scorsese at his best.  I don't always
like his work because he tends to get
too graphic with the violence, but if
you can stand it, a must see!
