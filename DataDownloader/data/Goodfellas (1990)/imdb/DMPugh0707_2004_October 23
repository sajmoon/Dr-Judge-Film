From the opening script &quot;From as far back as I can remember, I have
always wanted to be a gangster&quot; to the ending script &quot;I now live like
an average nobody, a schnook&quot;...the film culminates the real-life story
of Henry Hill, an Irish-Italian hoodlum growing up in New York in the
1950s and 1960s with aspirations of becoming a mobster. <br /><br />For any person who finds distaste with this film due to the violence,
language and content, I ask you to consider this... The reason this
film is so superb is that it takes us into the intimate life of a
person who was not &quot;an average nobody&quot; to quote the movie. Most people
find this interesting, enthralling and profoundly entertaining because
it is unique to the lives 90% of us lead. A film is supposed to be all
of these things. <br /><br />For any person who found this film magnificently scripted, acted and
directed - I would heartily agree. It is the BEST gangster film ever
made. Ever.<br /><br />Why is this film so darn good? I think for several reasons:<br /><br />1. The acting. The actors casted are believable. They are not typical
&quot;Hollywoodized&quot; actors and actresses. Not cosmetically enhanced,
wafer-thin or highly buffed, plastic. They are excellent at their craft
and you think to yourself &quot;I really could have know a person like
this&quot;. It adds realism to the film. Too many films are made that are
simply unreal (whether it be the plot, special effects or actors), and
that is not entertaining...it is a bore. <br /><br />2. The directing. The film direction, mixed with voice overs and unique
camera shots, captures the audience from the start of the film to the
end in a wonderful, compelling storytelling event.<br /><br />3. The musical score. Henry Hill's story begins in the 1950s when he
was a boy and ends in the 1980s when he is arrested for narcotics
dealing and enters the Witness Protection Program as the only option of
salvation. The music parallels Henry's life and brings back the
nostalgia of that time.<br /><br />4. A darn good story. Henry Hill's story, based on the book by Nicholas
Pileggi, is just a fascinating tale.<br /><br />I choose not to discuss details of the film as the film speaks for
itself. I highly recommend it.
