Goodfellas is without a doubt the best mob movie ever, far superior to
any of the Godfather movies. *gasp* No, the Godfather is not the holy
grail of movies that some people seem so intent to think that it is.
Goodfellas tells a better story and does so with infinitely more style.
Martin Scorsese is the best director in American history and Goodfellas
is the greatest of his works. It uses music as well as any other movie.
The performances are very solid - Pesci and Liotta are as good as they
have ever been and De Niro is unspectacularly perfect, as we all have
come to expect. Bracco is good enough and Sorvino is flawless.
Goodfellas, likewise, is flawless. It does everything that it does as
well as it possibly could. The Godfather is considered a greater work
only by stubborn old timers who have been saying &quot;the greatest movie
ever made&quot; in a Brando accent for 30 years. An average rating of 8.6
just doesn't make sense. If you've seen this movie and didn't give it
at least a 9, you're either intentionally messing up the rankings,
biased, or maybe incapable of understanding the messages sent by
Goodfellas.
