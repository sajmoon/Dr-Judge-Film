The worst thing that could happen when you are watching a movie is that
you don't care, you couldn't care less. That is what happened when I
saw it and mind you this is no lousy production or a B-movie, I mean
the main actors are people like Deniro, Sorvino, Pesci... It doesn't
work.<br /><br />There is nothing intriguing, there is nothing ironical. Ray Liotta
starts jazzing right away taking himself oh! so seriously and I
couldn't care less. All characters are unpleasant. This movie is
completely off balance.<br /><br />The inside scenes are too dark. The light is terrible. And I am sick
and tired of these Scorsese movies with the background music so loud!
Hasn't anybody noticed that the voices of the actors are barely
audible?
