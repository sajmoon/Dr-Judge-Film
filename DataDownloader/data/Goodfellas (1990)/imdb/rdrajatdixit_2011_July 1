Goodfellas is one of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s best works. Based on a true
story, it is about the rise and fall of Henry Hill( Ray Liotta), Jimmy
Conway( Robert Deniro) and Tommy DeVito( Joe Pesci). It is fast paced,
stylish and full of memorable scenes.<br /><br />Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Loraine Bracco give excellent performances.
Pesci steals the show as the violent gangster. Robert Deniro also plays
his part well. <br /><br />Direction is superb and so is the writing.<br /><br />This is definitely the best gangster movie after THe Godfather and The
Godfather part 2. <br /><br />Watch it. Strongly recommended (9/10)
