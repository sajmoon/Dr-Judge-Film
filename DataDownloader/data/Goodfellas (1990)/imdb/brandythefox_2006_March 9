I come back to watching this film every few years and each time I watch
it, it gets better and better. This was Martin Scorsese at his best. <br /><br />You can debate all you want about his early films, Raging Bull, Taxi
Driver, Mean Streets... they don't hold up to this one. It's as if
Scorsese's got everything rolling on this one - seamless editing
transitions, intelligent use of soundtrack, clever camera work, sharp
script, nuanced acting ... this film had everything he had to give.<br /><br />In many ways, it makes me kinda sad to see how the quality of so many
of Scorsese's films have tanked since. Oh, the critics will love the
movie he churns out every now and then but really they usually stink.<br /><br />(I mean, films like Kundun - big yawner, Gangs of New York - a
documentary disguised as a fiction film, Age of Innocence - enervating
drama of manners) Casino is probably the only exception - it's a decent
film. <br /><br />It's frightening how a director can slide downhill so fast.<br /><br />So, enjoy this film if you can. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Re-watch it.
You'll not see a better Scorsese film.
