Goodfellas is one of my favourite films and is my second favourite
Martin Scorsese film (Raging Bull is my first). This is one of the
first modern gangster films that look at the working class/file and
rank members of the Mafia, compared to films like the Godfather which
looked at the upper ranks.<br /><br />Goodfellas is based on the book Wise Guys, an autobiographical account
by Henry Hill, a former member of the Mafia. The film looks at rise in
the ranks from a 14-year-old boy to becoming a successful member,
making money and becoming happily married to spells in prison and
leaving the Mafia. The film looks at the working of the crime
organisation, but also looks at Hill&#39;s (Ray Liotta (easily his best
film)) personal life, such as his courting of Karen (Lorraine Bracco),
from an unsuccessful double date to marriage. It looks at his
relationships with other Mafia members and how they work together and
act like a family themselves. It does not show the Mafia as either good
or evil, even thought they do bad things, and makes the character
human. Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), is well played as a psychopath and
this film got Pesci an Oscar for best supporting actor. The casting is
brilliant, as already mentioned this is Liotta&#39;s best performance,
Robert De Niro is always good, so Joe Pesci and Bracco is good and she
ends up in the Soparnos.<br /><br />This film is excellent and should have won more Oscars, especially best
director. It has also been very influential in the gangster genre, from
the Soparnos, to films like Donnie Brasco to Scorese own film Casino,
and has been parodied in programs like the Simpsons and Futurama.
Goodfellas is a must see movie.
