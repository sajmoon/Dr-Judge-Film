I have never seen a film better or greater than Goodfellas. The
performances
are virtuoso, and this is Scorsese at is possible greatest. I own this film
because it is absolutely brilliant. It was a close run between it and my
number 2 movie, The Godfather. I believe, though, that Goodfellas is
arguably the greatest gangster film ever made, and the fact that Dances
With
Wolves won the Academy Awards for Best Picture is unforgivable. Goodfellas
is my number 1 movie.
