While the title of mob masterpiece most often goes to &#x22;The Godfather&#x22;
for its stunning drama and dark beauty, something must be said for
honesty. Those two points belong to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &#x22;Goodfellas,&#x22;
which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth,
without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only
honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction.<br /><br />Some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in
crazy and memorable ways, but in &#x22;Goodfellas,&#x22; when the only nutty
character, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it
feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. It&#x27;s because
to Scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a
hit because that&#x27;s how they do things -- there&#x27;s not a production to be
made out of it. <br /><br />The film, based on true events with much consultation from the real
life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster
Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him
everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty
low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the Witness
Protection Program in the &#x27;80s. <br /><br />Scorsese isn&#x27;t brilliant in this film. It&#x27;s not visionary. Leave that
for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good
storytelling. &#x22;As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a
gangster&#x22; is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film&#x27;s
beginning because it was inspired writing -- it&#x27;s Scorsese
understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way
possible. The only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera
shots and compelling angles. He finds the script&#x27;s best moments and
adds something to them. Otherwise, he is telling this story, he is
making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by
Nicholas Pileggi.<br /><br />Of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch.
Following him from &#x22;Raging Bull&#x22; among other films were Robert DeNiro
and Pesci as Jimmy and Tommy. Both characters are easily provoked,
sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right
place despite actions to the contrary. Pesci is particularly memorable
between the &#x22;in what way am I funny?&#x22; and &#x22;deer paw&#x22; scenes, a deserved
Oscar for great character work. As for Liotta, his great strength is
swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities
yet natural charms -- it&#x27;s a role that had Scorsese cast 15 years later
would have gone to the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, so let that stand as
some acclaim for Liotta. It is also this dichotomy of warm support and
foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we
watch the entire film. It doesn&#x27;t elicit pity for the mafia, but it
certainly complicates the &#x22;wiseguy&#x22; stereotype, which I think is much
of Scorsese&#x27;s goal.<br /><br />&#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull. Many times
you wonder why this story is being told, but then you realize how
incredibly well it&#x27;s told and you acknowledge that it&#x27;s some of the
finest film-making out there, regardless how it makes you feel.
