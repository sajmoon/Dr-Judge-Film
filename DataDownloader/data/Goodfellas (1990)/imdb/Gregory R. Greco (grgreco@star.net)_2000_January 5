Martin Scorcese has been one of the most important film makers of all time,
and while he has made more thoughtful and introspective films than
Goodfellas, he has never made a better or more enjoyable one.  Goodfellas is
a wonderfully full and well acted film about life in the mob.  Unlike the
Godfather, it doesn't romanticize the mob, but gives us insight into the
details of its life.  It also shows us one man's decent into drug addiction
and violence.  The film is long, but uses every second to give us a fuller
picture of Henry Hill's life.  Ray Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, a man
who only slowly realizes he has gotten way over his head.  Joe Pesci's
performance is rightfully considered a classic, and DeNiro gives us what he
always gives us-  this time in a supporting role.  Goodfellas knows the
rhythm and beat about living in the mob, and while The Godfather gives us
the melody, Goodfellas gives us its equally important counterpart.
