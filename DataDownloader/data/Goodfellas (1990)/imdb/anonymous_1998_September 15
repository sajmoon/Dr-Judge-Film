     Goodfellas isn't just some movie that portrays the mob in a typical city.
They have a purpose, they have reasons, they have fun for crying out loud. I
will say right now I've been sitting here for half an hour trying to figure how
to explain the movie and I think I realized I can't. If you've never seen the
movie then I seriously suggest you rent it, it's definitely worth the few
dollars' charge. If you liked Casino or Reservoir Dogs then you'll love this
movie.
