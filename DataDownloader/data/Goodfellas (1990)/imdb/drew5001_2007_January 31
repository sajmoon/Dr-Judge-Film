Can&#39;t add much that has not already been said. Scorcese was robbed in
&#39;91 when he didn&#39;t win the Oscar. Dances With Wolves for best pic and
Kevin Costner for best director. I&#39;m not taking anything away from the
pic or the director, but come on! Goodfellas and Scorcese all the way! <br /><br />If you have not seen this movie then get it today! Definitely worth a
viewing. You will not be disappointed. Keep in mind this is not to be
watched with children. Loaded with violence and foul language. This is
not a comedy, but it is full of hilarious scenes. The now famous
&quot;What&#39;s so funny about me?!?&quot; One of my personal favourites is the &quot;I
didn&#39;t mean to get blood on your floor Henry.&quot; or, after a brief speech
from Paulie: &quot;Hey Karen, I got the most expensive tree they had.&quot; I
could go on forever. As I am writing this I keep thinking of other
unforgettable moments that I could mention. Why do you need me telling
you about this movie? Go rent, or better yet, buy the special edition 2
disc DVD. I&#39;ll leave you with a quote from a notable critic when
speaking about another Scorcese movie I can&#39;t wait to see, &quot;The
Departed.&quot; He said, &quot;The Departed is probably the second best mid level
mob movie I have ever seen. The only reason I say this is the second
best is because of Goodfellas.&quot;<br /><br />I think I&#39;ll pop Goodfellas in the DVD player and watch it for the 50th
time. Happy viewing.
