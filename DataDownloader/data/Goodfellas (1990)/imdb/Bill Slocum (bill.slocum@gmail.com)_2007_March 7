The more time passes, the better &quot;GoodFellas&quot; looks.<br /><br />A decades-long examination of the Mafia lifestyle as seen through the
eyes of minor Brooklyn hoodlum Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), whose secret to
survival involves keeping quiet, &quot;GoodFellas&quot; puts you in the back seat
watching with Henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other
off. One thing about living the good life is that it&#39;s never good
enough. As Henry and wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) partake more in the
money, they also become more exposed to the danger.<br /><br />That&#39;s really the core of the story, though it&#39;s probable if you
haven&#39;t seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; you think more of it as the one where Henry&#39;s
temperamental friend Tommy (Joe Pesci) wants to know why you find him
so amusing.<br /><br />&quot;GoodFellas&quot; is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with
Tommy there&#39;s always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for
a deeper overall experience. Director Martin Scorsese and
co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the source book &quot;Wiseguy,&quot;
capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and
enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like
when Karen meets the other Mob wives and discovers their penchant for
double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles.<br /><br />Other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a
relativistic way (&quot;Godfather&quot;) or pump up the volume to an absurd
degree (1983&#39;s &quot;Scarface&quot;) in order to sensationalize and glamorize the
experience. &quot;GoodFellas,&quot; despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on
the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of Mafia living,
people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over
nickles and dimes. It&#39;s hard to see Scorsese&#39;s claims of detesting
violence in some of his other films, like &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; and
&quot;Casino,&quot; because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the
people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of
their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for
cheap effect.<br /><br />That and it&#39;s so damn entertaining. Scorsese puts on a clinic, one that
is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and
slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear Karen crying from one
scene while Henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next.
Even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there&#39;s
so much to take in) you aren&#39;t bored because there&#39;s always some new
thing to attract your attention.<br /><br />The character of Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro) is a little confusing
in the film, especially when he helps crazy Tommy whack a guy he should
know better about. The book explains this better, but &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is
one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the
most important person on screen when he is on screen. He&#39;s good, but
Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in
fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he
inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers &quot;GoodFellas&quot; message of how
the good life isn&#39;t all that good, that there&#39;s always something rotten
beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time.
