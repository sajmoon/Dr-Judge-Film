 Henry Hill (ray Liotta) reflects on his expirences, good bad and terrible,
while connected with the mafia throughout the 70's and 80's. we follow Hill
as he is sucked deeper and deeper into the evil business that had people
across the country in fear for their lives.
 Compelling, sharp, and dramatic at every minute, Goodfellas defines what
the mafia was really all about. The great Robert De Niro stars along side
Liotta, with Joe Pecshi in his over the top oscar winning portrayal of
psycotic gangster Tommy DeVito. the supporting cast couldn't be better. A
great film; could very well have gotten the Best picture
Oscar.
As great as this film is, it is sometimes unbearibly intencse at moments and
sometimes drags. but aside, this is amoung the best mob movies ever made.
8.8/10
