1999_July 8 

When it comes to this movie, Joe Pesci summarizes it all up pretty well:
&quot;What, you think I'm funny? How am I supposed to know? You said it and I'm
supposed to know! What am I, am I a clown? Do I amuse you? Is that what I
am? A f*@!#%' clown here to amuse you??????!!!!!&quot;<br /><br />God, he's good. His character, Tommy DeVito was just so screwed up, you
never knew what he'd do next, whether it'd be shooting somebody in the
foot
or killing a man because he called him a &quot;shoeshiner&quot;. AAAAHHHH!!!! I got
to
go watch it.<br /><br />9/10
