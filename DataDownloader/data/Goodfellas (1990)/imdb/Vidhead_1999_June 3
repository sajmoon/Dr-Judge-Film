1999_June 3 

Goodfellas is without a doubt my favorite American film in the last 20
years......hell I'm pushed to think of a better one ever. Scorcese hit all
the
right notes with this film. The use of music was spot on....the camera
work
was dazzling....who can forget the tracking shot as they walk into the
restaurant via the back door and take their seats front and centre. The
performances were uniformly wonderful....yeah, like Scorcese makes films
without great central performances...I think not. I pity Ray
Liotta....where
could he go after the performance he gave in Goodfellas?....Turbulence!!
It
reminds me of Ken Wahl after his role in The Wanderers. The guy shoulda
been
a star but it was never to be. Well there's nothing more for me to say
that
hasn't been said many times before about this amazing film. I just wish
films of this quality were the rule and not the exception.
