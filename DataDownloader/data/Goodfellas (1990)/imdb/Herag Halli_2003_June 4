Narration by Ray Liota and Lorraine Bracco. The background music that
fits every scene like a glove. The incredible acting by the cast. The
incisive screenplay and dialog with the best Sicilian accent and humor.
The brilliant direction by the Four Best directors in North America
(the others being-Coppola, Wise and Wyler) The casting is the key to
the marvel of these evergreen classics. Gangster movies or any movie
that brings the sinister side of the human psyche, have a certain edge
over the goody goody sugar coated flicks, since they donot give the
opportunity to bring the best of the talent in the cast. This is one of
the movies where every scene is etched in my memory, because of the
sheer directorial brilliance in story telling and editing. This is a
milestone in movie-making.
