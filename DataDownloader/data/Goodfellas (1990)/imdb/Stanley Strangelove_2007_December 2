The book, &quot;Wise Guys&quot;, is better than the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, still,
this is a very good movie. Told from the viewpoint of Ray Liotta who
plays Henry Hill. Liotta rises from a boy doing errands for the mob to
a high post, although, because he is not 100% Italian, he can never
become a &quot;made man.&quot; He marries Lorraine Bracco, a naive girl who gets
entrapped into being the wife of a mobster and grows to actually like
it. She aids her husband at every turn.<br /><br />The real star of this film though, is Joe Pesci. He plays mobster Tommy
DeVito. I&#39;d have to say that Pesci&#39;s character is probably one of the
scariest ever portrayed in film, a true Jekyll and Hyde personality who
can laugh with you one minute and brutally murder you the next. Very
creepy.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro plays James &#39;Jimmy&#39; Conway, another mobster.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a film that cashes in on The Godfather idea. The
Godfather is truly one of the all-time great films. Goodfellas is a
terrific film but doesn&#39;t match The Godfather. Still, it&#39;s well worth
seeing. Be warned. The F word is used liberally in the film and you
will not like the violence.<br /><br />A-
