Goodfellas begins with the childhood and the life of Henry,an all out kid
who as a child,dropped out of school to work and gain respect from the local
mob who terrorise his community.As Henry progress's through the stages of
the mafia,he meets local and ruthless mobster Jimmy and Tommy.As they grow
older through their years together,they form a brutal and ruthless business
of crime with their efforts in pursuing robberies,drugs and murder,but soon
things start to go downhill for them all and eveything turns sour when Henry
finds that him and his family are in danger.Goodfellas in opinion is the
greatest gangster film to date and it will be remembered as a pure genuine
classic for many years to come.Goodfellas is modern,visual and rather brutal
version of event which began in the fifties and ended in the eighties.It is
based on the lives of all of the people involved.The film includes moments
of pure brutality which some viewers might find domestic and hard to
stomach,but beyond all of this lies a deeply immersive and brilliant film
which has been made from a respected director.If you happen to be a fan of
any of these elements in movies,Goodfellas will not dissapoint you.
