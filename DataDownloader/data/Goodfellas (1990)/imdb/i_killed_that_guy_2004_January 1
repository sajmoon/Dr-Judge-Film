I cant say anything bad about this film. I've tried, I've watched it so
many
times, but still I want to see it again and again. To me there is nothing
better than this film, its an incredible acheievment. Joe Pesci, Robert
De
Niro, Paul Sorvino, Ray Liotta, everyones at a career best. Scorsces
direction is amazing. The soundtrack is wonderful. The script is the best
ever written. Nothing will ever be better than Goodfellas.
