2004_June 30 

I had to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. I never used to
watch gangster films but this one is certainly the greatest as far as i'm
concerned along with Godfather I and II and Scarface following very closely
behind. The performances, writing, directing are all outstnading. No actor
is slightly better or worse and they are all matched by each other. Liotta,
De Niro and Pesci are a fantastic team and they really do make you feel what
its like in the world of the mafia. Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorese's
script is outstanding is certainly Oscar worthy. But the acadamey disagreed.
At least they didn't look down on Pesci's brilliant supporting performance.
De Niro could also have won it and should have been nominated. But in my
opinion Liotta desreved Best Actor. He is basically taking us on a guide of
his 30 years of his life in the mafia and you just cannot take your eyes or
ears for that matter of it for one second. The narration is done so
brilliantly that you'd think Liotta was actually a member of the mafia!
Anyway this a fantastic film about the ups and down these three guys
(goodfellas) have throughout their time in the mafia and it has to be seen
by everyone at some point in there life!<br /><br />A certain 10/10
