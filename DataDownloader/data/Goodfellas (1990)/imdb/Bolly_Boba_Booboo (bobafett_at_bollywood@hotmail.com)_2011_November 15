The richness of the movie is unparalleled and is the best in American
cinema so far. The computer graphics in the end of the movie is top-
notch and is easily on par with top Bollywood movies. Hats off to
Director scorsese for his courage in successfully directing such a
niche subject to Tamil audiences by spending a whooping 165 crores of
Rupees. Enjoyable, entertaining and action-packed. I have to agree
though with another review who commented on the profanity. We watch all
our movies with a DVD player that filters out all profanity and more,
but it was obvious by how much was cut out there was too much (any
profanity is too much). That and the fact that a lot of the females in
the cast dressed like ho&#x27;s - to a ridiculous extreme. Get past that and
it wasn&#x27;t great, but good.<br /><br />Goodfellas is for everyone who have been praying to see the American
film industry rise to the level of Bollywood in technical finesse. This
movie is for everyone who love US movies for their entertainment value,
and not just for Joe Pesce fans. So, grab your popcorn, lean back in
your seat, whistle a few dozen times when the superstar performs his
stunts and have a wonderful time at the cinemas. This movie is the
reason why people watch mainstream movies!
