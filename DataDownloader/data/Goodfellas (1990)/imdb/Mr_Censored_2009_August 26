As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a
gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he
ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life
descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society
altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas
Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story
about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn&#x27;t feel
authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci
(who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in,
no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so
naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any
way. In fact, it&#x27;s almost as if the trio personally knew the people
they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film.
For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated,
and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid
supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank
Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through
the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the
shocking reality she must adapt to. <br /><br />The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch
of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone
is a testament to his status as one of America&#x27;s finest film-makers.
Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first
viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and
brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in
the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant
soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a
stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you
remember one thing about &#x22;Goodfellas,&#x22; it may very well be Eric
Clapton&#x27;s &#x22;Layla&#x22; and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.<br /><br />Without a doubt, &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is one of the finest mob films ever made
and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese&#x27;s best. From the
cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and
sensational perfection. View it, and you&#x27;ll see why it was such a
smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20
years later.
