One of the main points of Goodfellas is the fact that Henry and Jimmy
were not members of any family.Henry really wanted to be a made man but
knew he couldn't be.I feel this is why Scorsese made the film so un
moralistic. If the film was about made men then all the sentimentality
would have appeared, all the fake loyalty and what goes with it. In the
long run Henry Hill was a fool who found out the hard way that there is
no real loyalty within a mafia family and its associates. I've heard
that these days he could well have become a made man. Is this true. In
oen part of the film he explains that to become a made member you must
be able to trace both parents back to the homeland(Italy)but I read
somewhere that now you only have to trace one.
