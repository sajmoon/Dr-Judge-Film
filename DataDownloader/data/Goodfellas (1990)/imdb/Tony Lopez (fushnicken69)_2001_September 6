This is a flawless movie. Not a damn thing wrong with it. It's awfully hard
for me to pick a favorite movie but if I had to, this one would be up there
battling for the top spot. Martin Scorsese again proves to all doubters that
he is the master. When it comes to making an urban saga, you can't top
Scorsese. It's futile to even try. From the first frame of the movie, you're
sucked in and vacum sealed until the credits are over. Everything is top
notch. Joe Pesci gives one of the most memorable performances in screen
history. He takes what could have been a cliched, one dimensional character
and gives him life. Underneath all his boasts and jokes you can see a truly
insane man waiting for something to set him off. It's scary just to watch
him on the screen. You think he's gonna step out and smack you around. It's
a damn shame that he hasn't made a movie since Leathal Weapon 4. This movie
was so good that Scorsese practically remade it with Casino. To watch a
master at work and see the best film of the 90's, watch
Goodfellas.
