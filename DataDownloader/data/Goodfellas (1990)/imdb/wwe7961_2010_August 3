This movie is great. I just have such a good time watching it. It is at
the very top in the genre of crime dramas. The characters are very,
very memorable. The film has a nice sense of humor, and conversations
are very well written. I am very entertained while watching it. A very
big part of that is due to the actors having a lot of charisma in their
roles. Joe Peshi is the best example of this. He is very violent and
easily tempered, and does a good job at adding more to the character
with his great acting. It is a very big part of of crime drama history.
It is a very good film that I highly recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t
enjoyed it.<br /><br />4 stars out of 4
