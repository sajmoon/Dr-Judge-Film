&quot;GoodFellas&quot; is one of my favorite films, I have seen this movie countless
times and it gets better each time. Martin Scorsese is arguably the best
director working in films today and yet he has been ignored by the Oscars
countless times. Scorsese was at the top of his craft when he made this
film, and it shows. The cast in this movie is amazing. Robert DeNiro, Joe
Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all turn in top notch performances. Movies don't
get much better than this. Don't miss it.
