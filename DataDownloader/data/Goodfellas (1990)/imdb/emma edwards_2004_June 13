As I sit and watch 'goodfellas' I realize that this film embodies the
hopes and aspirations of a generation who had nowhere else to turn. As
Henry describes his upbringing, you can't help but feel for the plight
of his neighbourhood...(as he says he makes more than most of the
adults as a teenager). This film doesn't glorify the mob, but it does
identify the characters as human beings, especially Henry Hill. Plus it
has the added benefits of many actors that have since made great cast
members of sopranos Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, Frank Vincent, but to
name a few(another classic mob drama, roll on season 6!!) I'm not going
to make a lengthy summary of this particular Scorsese classic,but I
will say this, if ever there was a film to be seen based purely on
recommendations, Goodfellas would be it. Plain and simple.
