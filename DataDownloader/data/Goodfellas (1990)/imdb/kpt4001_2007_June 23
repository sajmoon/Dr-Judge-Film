By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of
voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a
movie as a visual medium. &quot;The actors should convey emotion through
their acting, not through voice-over,&quot; these critics might say. I argue
that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction,
masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer
soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could
we really understand Henry Hill&#39;s incredible story of prosperity and
joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking
soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero&#39;s crew of Brooklyn
wise guys. It&#39;s also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy
Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen
(Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to
some poor decision making on everyone&#39;s part, the good times don&#39;t last
long.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the
more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters,
Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her
innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband&#39;s actions in her v/o,
as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.<br /><br />Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind
in v/o because as &quot;Sopranos&quot; creator David Chase said, these guys
usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.<br /><br />The one thing I haven&#39;t mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole
cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast.
(Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many
other people, but he was much better in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; as was De Niro*.
That&#39;s saying something about &quot;Raging Bull&quot; because Pesci won an Oscar
for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.<br /><br />Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It&#39;s my
favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around
these people, so who better to tell their story? <br /><br />*Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did
research on the CIA and the florist industry for &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;.
