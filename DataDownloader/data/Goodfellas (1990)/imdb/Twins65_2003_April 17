How this movie lost the 1990 Best Picture Award to &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;
is one of Hollywood's great injustices. To put it another way, if you
had three hours to burn right now and had to pick between &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
and &quot;DWW&quot;, which movie would you rather watch?<br /><br />The story is awesome, the acting superb, the laughs and shocks come at
you throughout, the body count is high, and the it never drags once in
the almost 2 and 1/2 hour running time. <br /><br />Look for at least five future Sopranos stars (you know the
actors'names, so I'll give you their HBO alter egos---Dr. Melfi,
Christopher, Big Pussy, Paulie Walnuts, &amp; Phil Leotardo) <br /><br />It's an all time TOP 10 treat.
