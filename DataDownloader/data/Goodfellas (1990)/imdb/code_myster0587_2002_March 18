This is one of the best mob flicks I've ever seen, Deniro, Pesci, and Liotta
are the ultimate mob actors, this film was an excellent view of the true
story of Henry Hill, The suspense in this flick was great. You never can
trust anyone because &quot;Your murderers come with smiles.&quot; Even though the
ending is kind of known you still don't know whether to fear for this kid's
life or what! &quot;You think this is funny?&quot;
