Liotta rules this movie.
Big acts by Deniro, Pesci, Bracco... but Ray Liotta it's the essence of
this
movie. I just can't understand how can people say this is a great movie,
and, at the same time, saying that Liotta is lousy, must see this movie
sober (or drunk!).<br /><br />One of the movies of my life!<br /><br />
