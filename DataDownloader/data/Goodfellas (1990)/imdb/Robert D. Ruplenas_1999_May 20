Here's a contrarian opinion: GOODFELLAS is to be avoided unless you have a
strong stomach and a proclivity towards sadism. A basically tawdry and
sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a
garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly
revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible.
It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but
it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film.
