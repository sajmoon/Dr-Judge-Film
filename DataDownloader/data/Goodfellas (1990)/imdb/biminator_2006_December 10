This movie was far from perfect. Rather slow-moving, and on occasion,
simply boring. However, it was largely enjoyable.<br /><br />Now, webifi is trying to make this movie into &quot;Birth of a Nation 2.0&quot;,
ranting about its apparent racism. However, this simply isn&#39;t the case.
The use of the &quot;n-word&quot; is merely for illustrating the racism inherent
in society at the time the film is set. I personally don&#39;t like the
word, and I find its use generally unappealing. However, let&#39;s not kid
ourselves. People back in the Fifties, Sixties, and even Seventies used
the word all the time. Just because we find it unpleasant doesn&#39;t mean
we can ignore it.<br /><br />Furthermore, I find webifi&#39;s hypocrisy disturbing. He/she accuses
Caucasians as a whole of racism, which is inherently racist. I&#39;m quite
possibly as white as they come (hooray, stereotypes), and I have no ill
feelings towards people with a different skin color. Yet webifi clumps
&quot;us&quot; all together as one group with one set of beliefs. Despicable.<br /><br />The fact that the main characters meet no black people before going to
jail simply illustrates their own racism, rather than any Scorsese
harbors. They refuse to associate with African Americans unless they
have to, making them racists.<br /><br />On a more humorous note, &quot;This little director had a ball&quot;? Come on.
It&#39;s not Scorsese&#39;s fault he&#39;s 5&#39; 4&#39;&#39;. Leave the poor guy alone. I&#39;m
sure he got picked on enough as a child.<br /><br />Besides, he/she says this phrase twice, and seems to be fascinated by
the word &quot;lovely&quot;. Honestly, if you&#39;re going to go on a ridiculous rant
like this, get a damn thesaurus.<br /><br />Lastly, webifi insists on using the expression &quot;you people&quot; not once,
but twice. Seriously. As if this rant hadn&#39;t already been racist
enough. I, as a &quot;goofy white guy&quot; am practically forbidden from using
this term in front of anyone whose hide is a different shade than my
own, and yet, webifi, as a &quot;person of color&quot;, gets to use it all the
damn time. I&#39;m all for it, just let everybody say it, because who&#39;s to
say whether someone&#39;s referring to a specific ethnic group, or just a
non-specific group of people? Overall, I think webifi needs to examine
his/her own racism before coming here and calling &quot;white people&quot; a
bunch of racists.
