1999_July 1 

Goodfellas is the first and last word in gangster films, and except for
Casino - also, fittingly enough, a Martin Scorcese film starring Robert
DeNiro and Joe Pesci - it's hard to imagine another crime movie ever
having
quite the same impact. When it comes to films of this type, Scorcese is
one
of the most brilliant directors ever, and it's largely due to the fact
that
he very obviously allows his actors simply to act, and to &quot;become&quot; the
role
that they are trying to portray. His convincing, no-nonsense, honest
presentation of life in and around the mob has been imitated but never
duplicated, and reflects a clear awareness on his part of the unwritten
rules and principles of day-to-day urban interaction that go along with
the
business of crime.<br /><br />Joe Pesci won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of an unpredictable,
out-of-control, and psychopathic mobster, a performance in which he quite
literally scared the s**t out of movie audiences around the country. And
if
the award didn't go to him, it should have gone to Paul Sorvino, for his
equally convincing performance as the impassive, experienced capo who was
a
master of the street life, and had the upper hand on nearly everyone and
everything around him. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and (for a single but
unforgettable scene) Frank Vincent also did outstanding work.<br /><br />De Niro was in great form as well, although his performance becomes a
little
disappointing if you read Nicholas Pileggi's &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, where you learn
that
the character he portrayed was in real life a much scarier guy - even
tougher than the Pesci character. I wonder at times if Beau Starr, who
played Henry Hill's hot-tempered and violent father, would have been more
effective in that role.<br /><br />The film doesn't really tell a story. Instead, like Raging Bull and
Casino,
it essentially has the effect of a documentary. It's not a perfect movie -
it starts to drag at certain points about 3/4ths of the way through - but
this can be overlooked. It's heavy use of foul language is par for the
course - does anyone out there actually think gangsters use proper English
or speak without swearing?<br /><br />One other aspect of this film that I've never heard anyone mention is that
it makes a very strong case for the &quot;Crime Doesn't Pay&quot; argument, without
ever coming close to preaching. The message is loud and clear: Choose a
life
of crime, and eventually you'll wind up either murdered, in prison, or
hiding for the rest of your life in the witness protection program, and
this
holds no matter how tough, how powerful, how well-connected, or how smart
you think you are. Maybe it should be shown to youthful offenders headed
down the wrong path, who after seeing it, could be asked to explain
exactly
why they may still want to become criminals - I'd love to hear their
answers.
