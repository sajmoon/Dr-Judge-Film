&quot;GoodFellas&quot; may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that
its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. 
Films like &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;,
&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; would have likely
never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's
&quot;GoodFellas&quot;.  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year
stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn
whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the
heart of &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling
card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is
quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the
best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved
Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the &quot;dirty
work&quot;.  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many
film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.
