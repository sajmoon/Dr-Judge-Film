I love this movie. I think this is the ultimate gangster movie. The acting
is absolutely fantastic. Pesci, Liotta, and DeNiro all pull in great
performances. I think this movie will live to be one of the classic movies
of all time. Pesci won Best Supporting Actor for this movie, and it's very
well-deserved. He stole the show with his crazy, cowboy-like character,
Tommy. His cussing and killing is so convincing, it makes Pesci look like
the type of guy that would really blow a guy's head off in real life. Liotta
showed that he has the talent to lead a movie, and do it sucessfully. DeNiro
shows once again why he is considered to be one of the greatest actors of
all time. Lorraine Bracco is very good as Karen Hill. I think the camerawork
is spectacular providing great shots from all angles. This movie shows
everyone what gangster movies are supposed to be like. I give it an
A++++++++++++
