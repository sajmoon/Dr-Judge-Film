It's hard to choose a favorite Martin Scorsese film, but GoodFellas is mine.
Tough competition between Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, but GoodFellas just
really impresses me and fascinates me every time I watch it. A wonderfully
made, different sort of epic about the life of Henry Hill in the mob. Ray
Liotta gives, an outstanding, and probably the only amazing performance, of
his life; snubbed at Oscar time is the way I think of it. Joe Pesci had
probably the funniest lines in the film, and won a well deserved Oscar for
his fantastic performance. Robert De Niro gives nothing shy of one of his
best acts. Lorraine Bracco does a great job as Liotta's wife,
Karen.<br /><br />GoodFellas is great film making. Martin Scorsese made a true masterpiece as
director and screenwriter, along with Nicholas Pileggi. A terrible shame
that Dances With Wolves won most of the Oscars that GoodFellas was nominated
for. This used to be my favorite film until I saw Casablanca.<br /><br />Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director,
won for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />As one of the greatest films ever made, there is no way that you should miss
this!<br /><br />*****
