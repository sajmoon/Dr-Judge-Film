Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an
engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with
some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA (&quot;I always wanted to be
a gangster&quot;), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL
SORVINO.<br /><br />The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY
LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian
Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and
life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens
to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.<br /><br />It&#39;s a film very similar in theme to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but not quite up
to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit
for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI
as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning
supporting role.<br /><br />If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the
scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the
violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory &quot;crime does
not pay&quot; conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there&#39;s
seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop
songs of the period.
