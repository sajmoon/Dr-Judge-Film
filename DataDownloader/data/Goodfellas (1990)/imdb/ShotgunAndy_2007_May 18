If you have not seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; yet, then my question for you is
this: Why? &quot;GoodFellas,&quot; in addition to being the most accurate movie
about life in the mafia, is also one of the greatest films of all time!
The film is the story of the rise and fall of real-life gangster Henry
Hill (played very well by Ray Liotta), his marriage to Karen Hill
(Lorraine Bracco), and his friendship to fellow mobsters Jimmy Conaway
(Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, in his Oscar-winning
role), as well as friendship to mob boss Paulie Sicero (Paul Sorvino).
The film is full of great performances, all lead by the one, the only,
Martin Scorsese, who is at the tip top of his game in this film. It&#39;s
entertaining, brilliant, and, above all, a masterpiece. If you have yet
to see it, see it NOW! You won&#39;t be disappointed.
