In many ways the quintessential Scorsese picture, tying together all
the director&#x27;s favourite hobbyhorses and actors (The Mob, De Niro, the
Rolling Stones), GoodFellas was the first great crime thriller of the
1990s - and a classic as soon as it opened.<br /><br />Based on the memoir by stool pigeon Henry Hill, it has lost none of its
chilly, seductive power with the passing of time, owing to
career-defining turns from Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci - the latter so
good he&#x27;d virtually reprise the role for Goodfellas&#x27; spiritual twin,
Casino, along with a soundtrack to literally die for, bravura
camera-work and some authentic, blackly funny dialogue. Funny, how?
