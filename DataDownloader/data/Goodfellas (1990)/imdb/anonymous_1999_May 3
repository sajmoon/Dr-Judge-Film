1999_May 3 

This movie, unlike any others before it  shows the true side of the
italian underworld.It brings the powerful bosses and low level henchmen
alive like no other film.We see that life in the mafia is not all
glamorous
and thrilling.
Goodfellas has become the most quotable movie that I can remember.This
movie has become a part of mine and my friends every day conversation.We
work goodfellas lines into conversations about everything from baseball to
our wives and girlfriends.
