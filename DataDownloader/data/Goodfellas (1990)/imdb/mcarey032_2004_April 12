One of the best mob movies ever made. Scorsese has been robbed. He is one
of
the best directors. Not only did he combine original scoring with some of
the great music in the 20th century. It is an all time classic and it is a
movie that mob buffs should own. It's realism is captured on the screen
brilliantly by Ray Liota, Joe Pesci, and of course one of the best actors
ever Robert DeNiro. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino give great
performances
as well. The depth of how the mob actually operates is shown with such
truth. You will have a new found understanding on how the mafia can be
glamorous and treacherous in the same movie. So rent it, buy it, or at the
very least see it! The best!
