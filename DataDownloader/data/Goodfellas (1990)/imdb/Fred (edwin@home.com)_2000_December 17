There's nothing I could say that completely show how much I love this
movie.
The acting is absolutely perfect, the message is subtle but powerful, and,
most importantly, it's a fun ride the entire time. Like the gangsters in
this film, you may too feel guilty for enjoying the dark life. The oldies
soundtrack is, and this is severely understating, fantastic. Everything has
basically formed together in an almost perfect culmination that equals
undeniably &quot;the best mob movie ever&quot;, as is often quoted. The 'real' best
picture of 1990.
