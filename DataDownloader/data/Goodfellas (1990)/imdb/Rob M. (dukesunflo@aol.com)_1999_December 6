1999_December 6 

Most critics seem to think Scorsese will be remembered for Raging Bull.   I
disagree.   THis is pure cinema.  Scorsese works the entire movie like a
master, using freeze frames, slow motion, stunning steadicam work, and
other
techniques in a way that adds meaning to the work.   From start to finish,
this film is the opposite side of an equally wonderful film, The Godfather.
It shows us the unvarnished reality of the mob, the petty arguments, the
likable psychos, and general absurdities of a life of crime.   The movie
never stops moving and is one of the few movies I've ever seen that left me
in awe at the end.    This one was robbed of an Oscar.
Time will show that this is the one people remember from the 1990s.   My
3rd favorite film of all time behind Godfather I &amp; II.
