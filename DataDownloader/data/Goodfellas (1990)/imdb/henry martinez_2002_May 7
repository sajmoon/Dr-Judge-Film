I realize it is unfair to narrow down the &quot;Greatest film ever&quot; category.
However, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is movie perfection. Every minute of Martin
Scorsese's
masterpiece is skillfully directed. Film student's should be required to
watch this film at least twice. (The first time to get the story, the
second
time to catch all the little things). Scorsese is the only director that I
can think of that can actually film a metaphore. Example: when Karen Hill
is
given a gun to hide, where does she hide it? In a milk holder. What color
is
milk? White. For those of us who read and analyzed &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; we
know that white represents innocence. And  a bloodied gun into a milk
holder
represents her tainted innocence. That was one example of a metaphore
caught
on film. This film is also jam packed with what is called dark comedy. Why
are Henry Hill and Jimmy Conway worried about getting blood on their shoes
than the person they just killed? Another thing to watch out for are the
camera angles. Perfect. (I recommend the use of the handheld camera when
Henry and Karen are on their second date. Can you believe that was all in
one shot?). all of this while developing great realistic characters whose
humor is so subtle you may even question if it is really funny.  Most of us
movie lovers have seen &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but I ask all who is reading this
review one question: Have you really SEEN &quot;Goodfellas&quot;? **** out of
****
