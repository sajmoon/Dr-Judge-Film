Goodfellas is probably the greatest achievement in film history,with perfect
casting and acting,fantastic directing,editing,scripting,dialogue and period
setting.<br /><br />What really makes Goodfellas work is the flawless acting and intricate
dialogue.It is also a brilliant character study,fully allowing the viewer
into the minds of these guys.The film is also very funny at times,but at no
time do you feel the movie has resorted to cheap comedy.<br /><br />For me,this will always be the greatest picture of all time,no matter how
many movies come out in the future.
