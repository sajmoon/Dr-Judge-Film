One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are
movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This
movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is
the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He
than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of
the gangster ways and how they really did things.<br /><br />Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid
always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It
shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster
himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is
all about.<br /><br />Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie. Really makes me want to be a
wiseguy.
