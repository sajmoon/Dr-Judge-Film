Goodfellas is seriously one of the best movies ever made. Whenever I read
that I think the person liked that film a little too much and it probably
wasn't nearly as good as he thought it was. Let me say this: I can't
imagine
anyone who would not like this film. Everything is perfect. The story, the
characters, the environment, the dialogue. It is filled with details and
creative scenes and even some superb directing by Martin Scorcese. Even
the
soundtrack is terrific. Everything is excellent in Goodfellas and that's
why
it's one of the best movies ever made. It's bloody and filled with curses,
but those are not flaws and if you agree with that, then you will love it.
If for no other reason one should see it because it is Scorcese's
best.
