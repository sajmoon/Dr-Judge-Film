Goodfellas was both a critical and commercial comeback for Scorsese after
such risky, artistic ventures as The King of Comedy, After Hours and The
Last Temptation of Christ. This was Scorsese back in from. Echoing the old
Who's That Knocking At My Door and Mean Streets era yet a giant leap into
the future as well. All of the Scorsese trademarks are here and they click.
Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career as Henry Hill who becomes
involved with the local mob in his neighbor in Brooklyn from the time he was
a teen in the late fifties to his selling out to the FBI in the early
eighties in his attempt to escape organized crime. His metamorphosis from
wide eye youth to burnt out, coke addict is remarkable and harrowing. A
tribute to the talents of Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi and Liotta's acting
ability. Good supporting work from Robert Deniro, Lorriane Brocco, Paul
Sorvino and especially Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning turn. Kudos to all
involved.
