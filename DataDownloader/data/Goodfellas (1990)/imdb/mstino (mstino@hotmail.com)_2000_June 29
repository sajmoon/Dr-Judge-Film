Watching this movie for the umpteenth time I realized that Martin Scorsese
made a flawless movie.  I could not, and my friends could not find one
film
flub, one boring scene, one improbable line of dialogue or
action.<br /><br />On top of all this, look at the camera work.  Notice the scene in The
Copacabana where Henry Hill introduces us to his mob buddies.  Notice how
the camera doesn't cut away and how we are able to get a glimpse of each
character and have an understanding of who they are and what their
importance is.  Also, look at the famous shot in which the camera follows
Henry and Karen from their car all the way to their table.  It is almost
four minutes long!!!<br /><br />The camera work again comes into play in a more subtle manner in certain
scenes of the movie.  Notice how the camera is sped up during the events
of
May 11, 1980.  Every single scene, including the kitchen scene, are given
a
sense of urgency due to this camera work.<br /><br />Finally, I am proud to have noticed that Bobby Vinton's &quot;Roses are Red&quot;
plays four times during Henry and Karen's romancing including one &quot;live&quot;
performance.<br /><br />This is the perfect movie.  A captivating story, an energetic soundtrack,
fancy camera work.<br /><br />
