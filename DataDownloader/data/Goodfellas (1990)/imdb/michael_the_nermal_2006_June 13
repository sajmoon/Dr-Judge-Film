I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling
and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of
the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one
another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota,
lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al
Pacino&#39;s gangsters had. Liota&#39;s Henry Hill has very little that would
make him seem like somebody to care about, because he&#39;s always willing
to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his
comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no
reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De
Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities
about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random
murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this
movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the
life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome
venture.<br /><br />This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes,
as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything
relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes
betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not
something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay
very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot
actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of
blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature
prominent ultra-violence, like &quot;Robocop&quot; and &quot;Sin City,&quot; but those
movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie
does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don&#39;t expect this to be the
classic everyone seems to think it is.<br /><br />PS: Listen for the phrase &quot;you&#39;re busting my balls.&quot; Virtually all the
main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie
for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired
a scene in the TV series &quot;South Park,&quot; where Cartman says this phrase
to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times.
