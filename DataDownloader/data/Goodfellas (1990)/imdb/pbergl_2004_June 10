2004_June 10 

First of all, I own this movie on DVD, which says a lot, since I'm not
very inclined to spend $15 to buy but would rather spend $4 to rent.<br /><br />This movie is truly impressive. The story is strong; the characters are
memorable. The acting is superb -- Pesci steals the show, but DeNiro
and &quot;protaginist&quot; Liotta are subtly outstanding. <br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; keeps a strong pace and will not leave you bored. If you
are at all intrigued by organized crime, this glamorous view of mafia
life will keep you all the more entertained. The violence is not too
intentionally gory (see &quot;Scarface&quot; or &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; if you are
looking for senseless death). Instead, it is tasteful and powerful.<br /><br />I will point out the movie's only real shortcoming: a bit too much
narration. Obviously, the narration is important for those of us that
understand mob life, but it can be tedious at times. <br /><br />Overall, an essential drama about organized crime that has interesting
themes and tones. I say a MUST SEE, 8.5/10
