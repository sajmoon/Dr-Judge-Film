Martin Scorsese is hailed by many as the greatest living American
filmmaker, but with the passing of Swedish master auteur Ingmar Bergman
in 2007, I would argue that Scorsese is the greatest living filmmaker
in the world. &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is a perfect example of the brilliance of
Scorsese, as he takes his audience inside a world that is often
misunderstood by the general population.<br /><br />The film feels unbelievably authentic, not just because it&#x27;s based on
actual events, but because Scorsese understands this world as well as
any filmmaker ever could. Growing up on the streets of Manhattan&#x27;s
Lower East Side, Scorsese had plenty of exposure to the violent world
of the &#x22;Mafia.&#x22; Scorsese understands better than anyone the destructive
nature of the &#x22;mafia&#x22; lifestyle, but he also understands how appealing
it can be. That is what makes &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; such an incredibly powerful
film, the fact that the characters are not portrayed as one-dimensional
villains, but are presented as ordinary men who have been seduced by
the lifestyle from an early age.<br /><br />Scorsese does a masterful job of creating a world where death seems
like an inevitability. The famous &#x22;Funny Guy&#x22; scene is one of the most
powerful scenes in movie history because it so effectively captures the
volatility of the mafia lifestyle. The truth is, your best friend one
day, can become your worst enemy the next. Nothing gets in the way of
business, and as a result, friendships are of secondary importance. No
filmmaker is better at probing the psyches of violent men than
Scorsese. He burrows into the world of the mafia and doesn&#x27;t attempt to
sugarcoat it, which results in a film that is incredibly violent and
profane, but never gratuitous.<br /><br />&#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is not only a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of
the 1990s, but it is further proof that Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker
of incomparable talent.
