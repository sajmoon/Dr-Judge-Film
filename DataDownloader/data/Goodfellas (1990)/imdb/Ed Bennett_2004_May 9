I am a big Gangster film fan and this is one of favorites along with 'The
Godfather series', 'Scarface' and 'Casino'. It stars Robert De Niro (Jimmy
Conway), Joe Pesci (Tommy DeVito), Ray Liotta (Henry Hill), Paul Sorvino
(Paul Cicero) and Lorriane Bracco (Karen Hill). Goodfellas has got some of
the top Gangsters on screen in it. Jimmy Conway is the smartly dressed kind
of leader. Tommy DeVito is kind of like Nicky Santoro from Casino. He is
again one hell of a ruthless gangster. Henry Hill had always dreamed of
being a gangster and he is a brilliant one, despite being a rat and Paul
Cicero is a boss and is one of my favorite mob bosses on screen. I think
Goodfellas deserved more oscars than it won because it is a top class film.
If your a gangster fan, this is the film for you!!!!<br /><br />Rating - (10/10) *****
