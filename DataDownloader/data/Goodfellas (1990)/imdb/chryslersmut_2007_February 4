This movie started off very good, but scene that opens at Idlewater
Airport 1963 as denoted on screen and Henry HILL&#39;S character is leaning
on a 1965 Chevrolet Impala with a 1965 Buick wagon next to it just
wrecked the &quot;authenticity &quot;...All that money spent and such a blatant
screwup...Unforgivable..Perhaps change it to 1964 at the very least,
that is when new models were released usually around labor day.
Otherwise the potential was there for a truly good movie, mind you not
as wonderful as that wonderful classic Godfather or Godfather 2. I will
not even dare to mention that awful mess called Godfather 3 on these
hallowed grounds.
