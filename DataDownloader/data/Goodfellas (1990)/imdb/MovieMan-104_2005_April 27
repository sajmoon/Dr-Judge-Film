This a great movie, i love it. its very entertaining and is a great
movie. Its without question of of the best mob movies ever. Its my fav
mob movie.It has a lot of very good performances but i think the best
one is pescis. He played the best character in this movie. He without
question deserved his Oscar for his performance. This movie really
should won best picture n director though. i think think dances with
wolves is a very good movie but this one is better. Its hard to believe
it didn't win. If you haven't seen good fellas then u defiantly should.
its worth watching a whole bunch of times. I thinks its a classic it is
by far the best film of 1990 n is most likely martins best work.
