It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as
Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin
Scorsese&#x27;s best film and is a textbook example of a great director at
the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and
enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is
nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable
quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock
soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and
the ensemble cast is one of film&#x27;s finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for
his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by
Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an
instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany
