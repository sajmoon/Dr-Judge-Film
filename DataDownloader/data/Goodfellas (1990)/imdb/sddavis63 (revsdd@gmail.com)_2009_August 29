The obvious comparison for this movie is, of course, &#x22;The Godfather.&#x22;
Looked at in that way, I thought &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; was the superior movie -
actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in &#x22;The
Godfather&#x22; (especially Brando&#x27;s Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish
aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were
no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated
to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down
to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through
the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid,
glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then
lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main
actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did
well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie
thinking that you have a feel for what it&#x27;s like to live this life. As
the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying
against some of his former &#x22;buddies,&#x22; you also get a dose of reality.
These guys don&#x27;t go to the cops out of any real change of heart or
because they&#x27;re suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to
go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way
to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over
narration the point is well made that, even as he&#x27;s testifying against
these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it
for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to
pay for safety.<br /><br />Certainly, a better move than &#x22;The Godfather.&#x22; In all honesty, I think
they&#x27;re both over-rated on this site as the 2nd-best (&#x22;Godfather&#x22;) and
15-th best (&#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;) movies of all time at the time of writing.
Having said that, I did enjoy watching &#x22;Goodfellas.&#x22; 8/10
