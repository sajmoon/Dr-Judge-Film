A great film from a screenplay and entertainment point of view. Samuel L.
Jackson who plays a minor role in the film, hardly says a word and gets shot
in the head by Joe Pesci gets compensation in 'Jackie Brown' when Quentin
Tarantino allows him to shoot Robert De Niro in the head. What goes around,
comes around.
