In my opinion, this is the finest gangster/mafia film ever made. De Niro
is
truly fantastic, and Pesci is at his finest. it is funny, tragic, and
horrifying, and you walk away from it feeling as though you have come off
a
rolercoaster ride.<br /><br />This is far better than any other gangster movie because it has such a
wide
range of emotions. The godfather is like war and peace, an  epic in terms
of
length and gravity. Goodfellas is like a diary written by napoleons aide
de
campe, showing the humour behind the campaign, detailing the backstage
scenes, and tells you that Napoleon hates milk in his morning
coffee.
