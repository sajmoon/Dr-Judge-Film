This is the best gangster movie that i have ever seen. It deserves its
place in front of The Godfather. In fact this is much better then The
Godfather.<br /><br />The reason this rises above the other gangster movies is that it is
superior in every way. Its acting is superb and so believable that it
looks like it is really happening to the actors.<br /><br />Based on a true story, it shows the rise and fall of gangster Henry
Hill. It starts with Henry as a teenager and works it way up all the
way to the end.<br /><br />The detail that has been put into this is amazing. It feels like you
are taking a trip from the 50&#39;s all the way through to the late 80&#39;s.<br /><br />There is humor in there. Mainly the humor comes from Joe Pesci.<br /><br />Every actor did a great job. Robert De Niro is a very convincing
gangster. Joe Pesci is hilarious as always. But the one that stole the
show was Ray Liotta. He made me laugh, he made me angry. It was his
best performance.<br /><br />There are some great tunes in there. After the movie i was singing a
few of them.<br /><br />Goodfellas is not one for the kids. It has brutal violence and there
are lots of scenes of drug use and there is lots of swearing. It really
depends on how mature the child is. I recommend a minimum age of 12.<br /><br />I highly recommend this. This is a must see movie.<br /><br />My #1 gangster movie.<br /><br />10/10
