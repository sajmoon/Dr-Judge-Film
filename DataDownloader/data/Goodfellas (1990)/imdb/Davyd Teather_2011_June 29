Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies released in years. The
acting was top notch, it is well paced, the cinematography is well done
and it has a good story. This films chronicles the life of Henry Hill
from when he was a teenager, when he first became a gangster and his
life in the mob. Ray Liotta did a great job portraying the main
character Henry Hill. Robert De Niro was amazing as Jimmy Conway. Joe
Pesci did a fantastic job playing Tommy DeVito. Joe Pesci is one of
Hollywood&#x27;s best actors around. He can play the most violent and
foul-mouthed meanies to the guy you would want to be friends with. I
thought Casino was slightly better than this film but this is still an
awesome movie. This would be my second favourite Scorsese film. If you
like Martin Scorsese, I would definitely recommend this movie alongside
with Casino. This movie is a true masterpiece. Martin Scorsese&#x27;s second
best film.
