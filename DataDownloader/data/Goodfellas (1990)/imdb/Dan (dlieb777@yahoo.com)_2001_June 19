After years of pondering the question, I have concluded that this is my
favorite film of all time.  It has an extremely compelling narrative,
strong
acting performances, and wonderful cinematography.  The film depicts years
in the lives of Italian Americans in the mafia, and like a delicious
Italian
meal, the film is rich with variety and depth of the characters that appear
on the screen.  You'll find yourself moved to a wide range of emotions
while
watching this film.  Ray Liotta is very convincing as Henry Hill.  Pesci's
somewhat over-the-top performance brilliantly fits within the story
Scorcese
is telling.
