I love the brutality and profanity of this movie, I don&#39;t think it
deserves to be one of the greatest movies ever made, but right until
the end is enjoyable to watch. The end should have used some editing to
make it more tight. <br /><br />I hate Joe Pesci with all my life, he is a terrible actor and he always
does the same schtick in all his movies....he is annoying and dirty, i
clapped when he was shot dead!! <br /><br />I also could not believe how many visible mistakes are in this film!!
for example they show a shot of 1963 pre-JFK airport showing a 747
jumbo jet!!!!! the plane did not make its public debut until 1969!!!
little mistakes like this bother me and destroys the &quot;look&quot; of the
film......also Robert Deniro&#39;s first appearance on the film..he is
supposed to be 28 years old...yet he looks 40!! WTC ? <br /><br />Overall i love the sex, violence and profanity but needs a good
editing!
