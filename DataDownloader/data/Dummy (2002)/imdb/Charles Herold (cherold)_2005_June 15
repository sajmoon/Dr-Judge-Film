Ventriloquism turns up in movies and TV most often as the occupation of
murderous psychopaths, but Dummy has a somewhat more realistic and
creative idea; a shy wannabe ventriloquist who lets his witty, caustic
side come out through his dummy. Adrien Brody is extremely likable as
the ventriloquist and Milla Jovovich is quite funny and appealing as a
low-brow but well-meaning punk rocker whose attempt to become a wedding
singer is perhaps slightly more interesting than the main plot. The
movie has a gosh-gee-whiz charm to it and a Sweet follow-your-dream
sensibility, but it has a light humorous touch that keeps it from
becoming cloying.<br /><br />While enjoyable, the movie feels like the work of a director who still
has some things to learn. The movie tries too hard at times to be
quirky, and there are places where the story could have been filmed
more simply and moments that ring false in their quirkiness. And the
script can at times feel a little too pat. It's nothing terrible, it
just feels slightly off. But on the whole, an excellent movie.
