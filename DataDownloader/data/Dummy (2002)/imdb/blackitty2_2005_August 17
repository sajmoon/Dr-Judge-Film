It's a pity that Brody's award winning acting in &quot;The Pianist&quot;
overshadowed what I think was the best performance of his career so
far, as the romantically clueless and vocationally strange Steven in
&quot;Dummy&quot;. The film is just as captivating as &quot;The Pianist&quot;, but in
totally different ways. Brody completely inhabits of the body, mind,
and soul of Steven -- and his dummy -- surrounded by an amazing cast
that seems tailor made for each part. The film also includes some of
the most subtle and hilarious comedic situations ever. (If you enjoy
Wes Anderson or Coen Brothers style humor, then this will be a treat).
Brody's Steven is sweet, disturbing, funny, shy and sometimes brave
with amazing skill and believability. You feel yourself rooting for him
despite all odds. He's a lovable loser that you want to win the girl at
last, and I promise he'll be your favorite ventriloquist by the end of
the film. If you have an appetite for a unique, well-made movie to
restore your faith in movies (and actors) rent &quot;Dummy&quot; tonight.
