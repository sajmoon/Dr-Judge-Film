2003_August 22 

Saw this at an advanced screening in New York, so my hopes were not that
high, but this turned out to be extremely good.  Adrian Brody is
annoyingly
talented, and not just as a pianist!  That's really him throwing his
voice,
and he plays a very convincing nebish.  But Milla steals the show with
one
of the all-time great punk-klezmer performances (and how many of those
have
there been?).  There are all sorts of nifty little character things going
on
in the background, so I may have to see this movie again to take it all
in.
A great date movie, and a little pick-me-up for the loser in all of us.
