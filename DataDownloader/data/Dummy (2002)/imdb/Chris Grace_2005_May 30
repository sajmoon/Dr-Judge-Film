Dummy is a comedy. I know this because I laughed, and it felt like I
was supposed to.<br /><br />But I think I was supposed to feel something for at least one of these
characters as well, but I didn't.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is this really nerdy guy who has always wanted to be a
ventriloquist, but didn't get the courage to buy a dummy and try until
he saw an old movie one day. He also has a friend (Milla Jovovitch)
that's really weird and steals things a lot, and is basically there to
be some sort of comic relief and serve no other purpose, despite her
character providing a majority of the jokes that don't work.<br /><br />The movie is nothing to do jumping-jacks over, and will offer you
nothing more than a couple of good dummy jokes and a really hot Milla
Jovovitch singing really badly. The movie tries to do quite a few
things but achieves none of them to an extent to which I would call
affective.
