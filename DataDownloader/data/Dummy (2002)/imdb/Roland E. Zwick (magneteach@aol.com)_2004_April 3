Is there anything in this world creepier than a ventriloquist's dummy?  Rod
Serling apparently didn't think so when he turned one into a raving
psychopath in a memorable episode of `The Twilight Zone.'  In `Dummy,' the
delightfully quirky comedy by writer/director Greg Pritikin, the dummy turns
out to be just about the least creepy character in the film &#150; and I mean
that in the nicest way possible.<br /><br />Adrien Brody, in a film made prior to (but released after) his Oscar-winning
triumph in `The Pianist,' stars as Steven Schoichet, a mild-mannered,
socially backward man in his late 20's who still lives at home with his
parents and his equally dysfunctional sister.  One day, Steven decides to
purchase a ventriloquist's dummy, a move that finally gives him the courage
to break out of his shell and pursue the woman of his dreams.<br /><br />Pritikin has come up with an extraordinary ensemble cast that includes, in
addition to Brody, Illeana Douglas, as Steven's lovelorn, perpetually
frustrated sister; Milla Jovovich, as Steven's foulmouthed wannabe punk rock
star friend and companion; Jessica Walter as Steven's off-the-wall mother
who figures she can keep her son happy if she perpetually feeds him
sandwiches; and Ron Leibman as Steven's father who just wants to spend his
time putting together model ships and who can't understand how he's ended up
with two children so obviously devoid of purpose and direction in life. 
Vera Farmiga is charming and winning as the unemployment counselor - perhaps
the one `uncertifiable' character in the film - who opens her heart to both
Steven and his dummy companion.<br /><br />Pritikin has taken some very simple material and woven it into a
many-splendored tapestry, hitting just the right tone all the way through. 
The film is wickedly funny one moment and touchingly romantic the next. 
Yet, Pritikin never violates the uniquely quirky spirit of the premise he's
established.  It is particularly fun watching Steven engage in long-running
conversations with himself, using the dummy as a sounding board for working
out his own insecurities and fears. <br /><br />Beautifully written, directed and acted, `Dummy' is one of the genuine,
certified sleepers of the past several years. <br /><br />
