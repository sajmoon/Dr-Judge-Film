Adrien Brody is a twenty something man who lives at home with his
parents and his sister. He's got a dysfunctional family (sister's a
master of emotional outbursts), mother just wants to feed him, and
father's too caught up in his model ships), a girlfriend whose singing
career has gone down the tubes, and a job that's going nowhere. What to
do? Quit his job and become a ventriloquist, that's what! The movie
depicts Brody's events to break away from his family and make something
of himself. The movie's gentle, sweet and quirky (reminded me of a
Woody Allen comedy to be honest), and features characters you care
about. Check this one out-you won't be disappointed.
