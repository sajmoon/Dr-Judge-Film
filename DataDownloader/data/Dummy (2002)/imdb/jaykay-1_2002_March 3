<br /><br />I had a premonition I was about to see a comedy with a lot of heart even
before the main titles played out at a screening of &quot;Dummy&quot; at the
American
Film Market 2000 recently.<br /><br />In the opening scene, Steven, who lives with his eccentric parents and
sister, sits enthralled watching the flickering tv image of ventriloquist
Edgar Bergan and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy. As the camera moves in on
the
young man, we see in his eyes the depth of his dreams and aspirations to
at
last make something of his humdrum life.
The next day, he gives up his 9-to-5 job and announces to his
dysfunctional
family that he wants to be a ventriloquist. His ever-busy mother(Jessica
Walter), making yet another tuna sandwich, remarks that his career choice
is&quot; nice but not very realistic&quot; while his sister observes that with the
dummy on his lap, Steven looks like a child molester.<br /><br />Casting is right on the mark. Adrien Brody brings a sympathetic and
likable
quality to the role of Steven as he manipulates his dummy to express his
own
private fears and feelings to the people around him. Vera Farmiga, the
love
interest,  is extremely engaging as his employment counselor and Illeana
Douglas, the very unmarried sister, is constantly funny. Outstanding too
is
Milla Javovich as Steven's best friend, a punk rocker with layers of
attitude. Writer and director Greg Pritikin skillfully holds down the
pathos
and gives his film just the right touch of humor. An entertaining movie
that
is worth a look.
