This film is about a talented ventriloquist and his loser life. He
finds solace in his dummy and a girl of his dreams.<br /><br />&#x22;Dummy&#x22; is interestingly fun and dark at the same time. Adrien Brody is
great as a socially inept individual, he portrays timidness so well.
Milla Jovovich plays an emotionally unstable rocker, and she also
shines. The dysfunctional family interaction is eye catching. I feel so
sorry for Illeana Douglas&#x27; character as she sacrificed her dreams to
please others. Somehow, these wildly different individuals&#x27;
interactions form a journey of self fulfillment and happiness.<br /><br />I find &#x22;Dummy&#x22; an intelligent and multi-layered comedy, I think it
deserves a wider audience.
