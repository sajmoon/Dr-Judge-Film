Dummy felt just that, dumb. It disappointed on several levels, but at
the core it never really explored its premise. The central character
played by Adrian Brody is an idiot, as displayed by his trust in his
one dimensional crazy friend Milla Jovovich. The conceit is that he
finds his voice through a ventriloquist dummy he buys. The dummy is the
most believable character in the whole movie. I suppose the dummy
expresses innate talent and thoughtfulness that Brody always had
inside, but I thought Brody's character was so stupid before and after
the dummy that I couldn't believe that he was anything but a village
idiot. I am left with questions, not the good pondering kind, but the
what the hell kind. Most of the characters are one note and one
dimensional and have no connection to how people act. It seems as if
the director was looking for a Wes Anderson kind of feel, with a bit of
David Sedaris acid thrown in. But both Anderson and Sedaris have an
emotional intelligence and character believability no matter how
&quot;wacky&quot; the situations they contrive are. In this film I never felt
like there was any real growth with the characters. <br /><br />Please, save yourself some time and a couple bucks, don't rent this.
