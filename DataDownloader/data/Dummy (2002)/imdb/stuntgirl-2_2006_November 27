Adrien Brody , Milla Jovovich, and Illeana Douglas are all hilarious in
this great little comedy... Beautiful Milla shows her unique talent for
being simultaneously really sexy and really funny, as she did 5 yrs
earlier, in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;... What I like most is that the humour
is mainly subtle. The funniest bits are more understated than they are
in the bigger-budget comedies with the in-your-face &#150; appeal to the
broadest possible audience stuff... &quot;Dummy&quot; is a fine example of not
compromising, in order to harvest the biggest-possible box-office
receipts. I give this side-splitting indie 8 big-ones and
whole-heartedly recommend it.
