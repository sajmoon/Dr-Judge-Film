I went into DUMMY with thoughts of a black comedy littered with satire
and
sorrow. Instead I got an amusing, poetic and gentle story that leaves you
feeling good all over.Overall the film reminded me of John Water's
PECKER.
(Which IMO is a good thing).<br /><br />The film is not without wit and quirk with a dark edge. Thanks to a tight
script that fully realizes charecters and allows us to laugh at the
unique
subtleties in all of them.<br /><br />The cinematography is controlled and often merly observing. Then letting
us
know the camera is there at key intervals with a bold move or gradual
dolly
shot. The soundtrack is a mix of genres with all of them assisting the
narrative or evoking a mood for a scene.<br /><br />Well rounded and Individual performances by all involved. Adrien Brody
(Stephen) is superb as the maladjusted, socially inept and gentle soul
that
we empathise with. With help from a domineering &quot;Dummy&quot; and a deliciously
eccentric Milla Jovovich, Stephen finds himself and hopefully scores the
woman of his dreams. His family are all riddled with quirks and dont see
what we the audience knows. It's as if we are the only ones who care what
happens to him.<br /><br />So any of you fans of off centre comedies that are intelligent,
insightful
and entertaining check this one out..<br /><br />
