Before anything else I must say that I really like Milla Jovovich as a
actress. She is not just beautiful, but a very competent actress. Prove
of that is her work on &quot;You Stupid Man&quot;, &quot;The House on Turk Street&quot;,
&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan
of Arc&quot;. But on Dummy, she tried to be a punk girl... It was fake, rude
and ugly.<br /><br />The performance of the rest of the cast was very convincing, specially
Adrien Brody (Steve) and Illeana Douglas (Heidi).<br /><br />The script it's kind of slow and boring. You wait to something happen
to shake things up, but the changes are very slow and inexpressive.<br /><br />If you are a patient person in a patient day, it's a nice movie.
Otherwise, stay away!
