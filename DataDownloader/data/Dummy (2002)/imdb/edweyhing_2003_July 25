This is a wonderful movie, a strong presence at the 2003 Newport Film
Festival.  If the presence of Adrien Brody gives it more cache, the movie
deserves it.  The young man Steven is in a hopeless unemployed life when
he
decides to adopt a Dummy and become a ventriloquist.  The movie shows the
Dummy becoming his alter ego, changing his life dramatically, as well as
that of his sister, his former best girl-friend, and his employment social
worker, with whom he falls in love.  By the end of the movie we too
believe
that the Dummy is the human force he seems to be.  Director Pritikin uses
his sense of humor - but also asks us to suspend our disbelief just enough
to make the whole experience fantastic.
