Not just another `Dumb &amp; Dumber' film, but there is more than one dummy
involved.  An inveterate schlemozel takes up ventriloquism and finds his
alter-ego through the puppet.  He's Jewish, of course, aren't they all?  He
lives at home with his folks and has no life.  His sister is as neurotic as
he is, his retired dad plays with plastic models, and his mom thinks the
answer to every problem is that you should eat something.  His best (and
only) friend is a totally wacked out shiksa with a heavy-metal band that
can't get a gig, and is even less sophisticated than the schlemozel (were
that possible).  He loses his job and ends up falling in love with another
shiksa who works at the unemployment office, and who has a child out of
wedlock.  All burned out on losers she is of course ripe for an adult child
with an emotionally arrested development.  The best lines are said by the
`real' dummy, who isn't even given a name.  Amusing, but perhaps more so for
those who are conventionally Jewish and don't mind laughing at the Woody
Allen version of Jewish culture.
