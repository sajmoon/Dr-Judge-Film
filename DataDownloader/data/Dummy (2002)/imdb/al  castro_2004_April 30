As a former fan of the Chuckie movies as high camp, i enjoyed the Pianist
very much and will be showing this film to my girlfriend Saturday.  After
being the subdued and reflective polish piano player , this was actually a
movie that displays similar acting but was executed very
differently.<br /><br />He's something of a cross between Woody Allen and Phillip Roth, inhibited
but a social critic by the work he does.  Woody Allen used to say that he
wanted to use his shrink fees as a business deduction.<br /><br />Brody was delightfully himself without commenting on his nutty friend or
the
goofy parents and the interaction and pleasant relationships with his
sister
her flaky ex-fiance and others were a reflection of his life.  His
phenomenological response to a bizarre life shows us we can live with our
circumstances and become a fulfilled and complete person by following our
heart without self-commiting to a head hospital.  From victim to
victor.<br /><br />May consider buying this one.
