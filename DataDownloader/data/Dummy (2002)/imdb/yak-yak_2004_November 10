It may well be that nobody ever reads this, but here goes. Dummy is a
mosaic of interesting characters, and only one flop, that was Fangora
(Milla Jovovich). B grade acting school performance from that one.
Anyway, all the other characters were intentionally overdone, and
Stephen (Adrian Brody) was fascinating in his interaction with the
dummy, not to mention funny. The movie doesn't take itself too
seriously, which is good, because you shouldn't either.<br /><br />As for plot, well, a directionless not-so-young man takes up
ventriloquism, and that's not a very socially expansive thing to do.
Works for me.<br /><br />So I liked the movie, it was entertaining, apart from Fangora, and it's
worth a look.<br /><br />7/10
