Dummy takes a simple premise - a man pushing 30 still living with his
parents and unable to assert himself professionally, romantically or
socially. After being fired he decides to go for his dream - to become
a ventriloquist. The most amazing side effect of working with a dummy
is Steven develops an edge to his otherwise bland character and life
takes on a whole new direction.<br /><br />Egged on by his best friend the punk, Fangora, a foul-mouthed, strident
loser in her own right played with zero charm by Milla Jovovich, Steven
takes risks that sound like bad ideas to him - and prove to be just
that.<br /><br />Steven's not the only loser at home, his older sister - a hilariously
deadpan Ileana Douglas - gave up her own dream of becoming a singer.
It's easy to see where the this pair of siblings lack of self esteem
comes from once we meet Mom and Dad. The entire family could easily
fall into the realm of stereotype or caricature, but Jessica Walter and
Ron Liebman make this material fresh and hilarious. When Steven invites
his potential paramour, a single mother, to a family dinner, the
results are, predictably, outrageously funny.<br /><br />There is a love story woven into Dummy, but ultimately it's Steven's
journey of self-awareness and acceptance that is the heart of this
story and that impresses the most. A fun, fun ride.
