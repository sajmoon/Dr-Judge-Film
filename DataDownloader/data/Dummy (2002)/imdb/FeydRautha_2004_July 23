2004_July 23 

I originally rented this (it's only available straight-to-video/DVD
Down Under) on the recommendation of a friend...and I wasn't
disappointed.<br /><br />Steven's a forelorn pencil-pusher who longs to be a ventriloquist; his
sister (Douglas) is a brow-beaten (by their mother, wonderfully
portrayed by Jessica Walter) wannabe singer, who's trying her hand at
wedding planning; his best friend, &quot;Fangora&quot; (played by Milla Jovovich,
who all but steals the show) is a foul-mouthed, determined punk
singer/anti-societal. Steven breaks free from his work bounds and
purchases The Dummy...and therein lies the tale. Who's controlling
whom?<br /><br />Greg Pritikin plays a master stroke by combining sharp, dark comedy
with Steven's (and others') emotional angst, but never lets the
audience go astray once. The Dummy takes on a character of its own
(greatly helped by Adrien Brody's work here), to the point of giving
Steven advice on how to capture the potential love of his life.<br /><br />The score aptly frames each scene, and the dialogue is rippingly funny
in places. I'd spoil it for you if I gave any examples. The principal
cast carry this film to great comedic heights, without letting you
forget that the story's just about one under-appreciated man, his
Dummy, and the universal search for love and acceptance.<br /><br />I've since shown my copy to several friends, and would recommend this
film to anyone. A good night in with the (wooden) companion of choice.
