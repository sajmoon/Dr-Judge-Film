2004_April 7 

Let's face it: even Woody Allen has gotten stale setting up laughs using
the
stereotypical Jewish dysfunctional family (is there an oxymoron in that
description?).  It's been done so many times.  The welcome surprise is
that
director and writer Greg Pritikin takes this old kreplach (in place of
chestnut) and makes it work with a novel theme brought to life by a
terrific
cast.<br /><br />Adrien Brody made this movie before his Oscar-winning portrayal of a
gifted
Jewish musician in &quot;The Pianist.&quot;  Here he is a young man, Steve, whose
lifelong ambition (he's bordering on thirty) is to become a ventriloquist.
He buys a dummy and takes lessons (Brody, who passed fairly well as a
concert pianist in his better known film, actually did all the dummy
tricks
and ventriloquism here).<br /><br />Steve lives at home with his mom (Jessica Walter) who is forever shoving
food at everyone.  His dad (Ron Leibman) is retired and he pursues a
common
hobby of men no longer gainfully employed: making scale model warships
while
watching hard core porn.  Sister Heidi (Ileana Douglas) dreamed of
becoming
a singer.  Her ambition crushed, largely by her scatterbrain mother, she
is
now a wedding planner, her first big job creating agita in the first
degree.
She's pursued by a clearly insane former fiance to her
distress.<br /><br />Steve's closest friend from high school days is rock singer Fangera (Milla
Jovovich) who has a cum laude Master's in Public Crudity.  Their
relationship is platonic and Fangera is very albeit crazily devoted to her
longtime buddy. Desperate for work for herself and her band, she passes
herself off to Heidi as a klezmer specialist, exactly what the despairing
wedding planner needs for her first big event.  Of course she knows
nothing
about klezmer music and her immersion in studying that genre is a riot by
itself.  So is the payoff at the wedding.<br /><br />Steve, fired from his job, meets employment counselor Lorena (Vera
Farmiga)
and sparks of all kind begin to fly.  Lorena is a single mother with an
adorable little girl and she's both attracted to Steve and shy about a
commitment.  Their relationship, which begins with a weird approach
concocted by the barely sane Fangera, rolls back and forth and is kind of
touching.<br /><br />No need to say more about the plot.  This fast-paced romantic comedy works
with all the principal cast members playing off each other in an often
funny
and occasionally serious and meaningful way.  Surprises are few but when
has
a ventriloquist's dummy been central to story development in any recent
film?<br /><br />The special features on the DVD are fun.  Included is an interactive test
in
which the viewer answers a series of questions and then finds out what
kind
of dummy he or she is.  I was ranked a ...hey, that's my personal
business.<br /><br />There's also a storyboard history of ventriloquism which points out that
this entertainment form allowed, decades ago, a performer to &quot;say&quot; things
through his dummy that would have been unacceptable directly from his
mouth
(including negative comments about politicians).<br /><br />As usual, reading the credits closely paid off.  The technical adviser was
Paul Winchell and the assistant technical adviser...Jerry Mahoney.  I
think
you have to be from my generation to appreciate that.<br /><br />8/10
