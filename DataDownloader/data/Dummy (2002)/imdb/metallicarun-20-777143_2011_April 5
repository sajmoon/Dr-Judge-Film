Dummy is a wonderful colorful movie that I just picked up because i
really like Adrian Brody and Vera Farmiga. But surprise,
surprise....the real star of the show is neither of the two. Milla
Jovovich as the incessantly cursing punk rock star steals the show. The
movie is essentially about a shy person(Brody) who wants to be a
ventriloquist and his tumultuous life. Milla is his only friend who is
brash and loud. She tries to help him out when Brody is interested in
his employment counselor(Farmiga). <br /><br />A brilliantly scripted movie with a lot of funny scenes (mostly
involving Milla&#x27;s antics) is the second movie by Greg Pritkin and his
best. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies
of the Wes Anderson genre, i.e, either of The Darjeeling Limited or The
royal Tenenbaums.....
