This movie is terrific. It's very funny and very powerful. Everything
that happens is a necessary plot point to tell the story. Nothing is
extraneous. Each character is uniquely entertaining and real, they each
remind us of someone we know. We root for Stephen, we dislike Heidi,
and we can't help but love Fanny. The characters are developed
wonderfully. The performances are all terrific. I've never seen any of
Adrien Brody's work before, but if it's all as great as this then he's
destined for super stardom. Illeana Douglas is hilarious and perfect as
usual. I was most blown away by Milla Jovovich. She's amazingly fun to
watch on screen and her New Jersey accent is dead-on. Great dialog and
flawless directing. Simply put it's a wonderful film with a unique
theme, which is unique in itself.
