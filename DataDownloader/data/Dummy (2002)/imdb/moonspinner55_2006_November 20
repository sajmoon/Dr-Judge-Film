Adrien Brody is quietly wonderful as an unemployed nebbish in his late
twenties who stills lives with his parents and has a fascination with
ventriloquism; he finally buys a dummy of his own and practices the
craft he&#x27;s dreamed about, yet also realizes (via his new wooden
companion) that it may be time to start growing up. Greg Pritikin wrote
and directed this low-budget satire of suburban craziness, and seems to
harbor an affection for bughouse characters all living on the edge. It
isn&#x27;t an original vision (Hal Hartley was mining this dryly eccentric
territory 10 years ago), but it&#x27;s still surprising how successfully
Pritikin manages to pull this intentionally bumpy story together. Milla
Jovovich is initially off-putting playing Brody&#x27;s friend, a
foul-mouthed garage rocker, but when she gets her band a job playing
klesmer songs at a wedding--and immerses herself in the Jewish
language--she reveals an appealing, sassy side that totally fits into
Pritikin&#x27;s offbeat universe. Illeana Douglas and Vera Farmiga are also
very fine, and though the construction of the script is
caricature-oriented, most of these actors overcome the slight material,
revealing something unexpected in the process: a sunny story about
weirdos that ultimately celebrates humanity. **1/2 from ****
