Milla Jovovitch is so incredibly sexy in this movie it is incredible.
Her character (Fangora) is a bit foul mouthed but she seems to grow as
a person, and when she gets her first booking for her band it seems to
change her. She wants to be some kind of Grunge Rock singer, but her
friend gets her band a job playing Klezzmer music at a Jewish wedding.
The amazing thing is that Milla and her band work hard to learn the
music, listen to old records, rehearse, and when she is finally at the
wedding she and her band do a great job. I wonder if she and her band
were the actual performers? She sounds fabulous, and she has beautiful
eyes. The eyes are the windows of the soul, are they not? Adrien Brody
is the star, and in the role of Steven he does a very solid turn as a
shy man who wants to break away and set his own course in life. Brody
is trying to learn to be a ventriloquist, and his efforts just show how
difficult it can be for anyone to start over in life. Brody does a
wonderfully positive and warm portrayal of a person who is searching
for an answer.<br /><br />Ileana Douglas injects her special charisma into her role as Heidi, a
friend of Brody/Steven. Ron Liebman and Jessica Walter play Brody's
parents and they help to provide a credible reason to understand why
Brody wants to find a new direction in his life.<br /><br />If you enjoy a warm and positive movie which slowly builds up towards a
positive resolution of most of the issues, then Dummy is a great film.
If you enjoy watching sincere and good-hearted performances, then you
will also enjoy Dummy.
