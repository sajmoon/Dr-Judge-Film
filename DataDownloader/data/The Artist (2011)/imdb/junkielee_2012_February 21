2012_February 21 
Having watched this soon-to-be Oscar winner in the local cinema (after
repeatedly brainwashed by its trailer in the multiplexes), indeed it&#x27;s
my third encounter with silent films behind SUNRISE (1927), and
FINANCES OF THE GRAND DUKE (1924). The film is masterfully presented
from the very beginning until the NEAR-end. THE ARTIST is among the
laureates of 2011&#x27;s film territory without any doubt.<br /><br />But, in my very own opinion, the much-anticipated Oscar sweep is simply
a victory of nostalgia. If it had been made decades before, say 60
years ago, it would be boosted as a silent version of A STAR IS BORN
with an excellent cast and splendid score, smooth and melodic, and be
ascertained as a major contender but with little likeness to procure
the sure-fire ultimate winner kudos which it has now in 2012, when
audience has been accustomed to talkies for ages. THE ARTIST is defying
all the regular habits to remind cineastes that a silent B&#x26;W film could
be so potently entertaining and watchable. My point is that I don&#x27;t
think the film itself should take all the credit, though the team
behind does have a genius concoction to evoke the retro fixation to its
core targets, film-related mass which are the pillar of the film
industry (academy included for sure). I doubt who in the field will not
love the film? It&#x27;s a crowd-pleaser for filmmakers, especially the
elderly rank. (Actually THE ARTIST and HUGO are holding the same slant
here, but Martin Scorsese utilizes tons of money to invest a monolithic
fantasy while a foreign no-name Michel Hazanavicius and his troupe
achieves the same effect through a more lightweight and unconventional
approach, so if the ballots are leaning towards THE ARTIST, no one
should scratch their heads.)<br /><br />Also another edge of THE ARTIST is that despite of the pungent
situation of both film&#x27;s languid box office income is embarrassing no
matter who will win the game eventually, there is an essential
difference between them, that is THE ARTIST has no difficulty to
retrieve its meager budget ($15,000,000), meanwhile HUGO seems to be on
the right track of becoming another commercial flunk like THE GOLDEN
COMPASS (if not more) even though it&#x27;s a Scorsese vehicle, which is not
an encouraging exemplar for Hollywood tycoons to bankroll their future
projects. <br /><br />Digressing back from the film itself, Jean Dujardin is my current
winning for BEST ACTOR, whose protean flair of balancing between comedy
and drama is admirable and compelling; Ms. Bejo&#x27;s ambiguous
leading/supporting status maybe hamper her ballots but she is
impeccable in the film. <br /><br />The said &#x22;NEAR-end&#x22; incident concerns my thought of the final scene of
the talkie moment, which is a regretful anticlimax for me (although
sound and words are plied flawlessly during the middle session to
underline the conversion to the talkie era), but Mr. Dujardin&#x27;s French
accent last word is not attuned with his character at all, which
downgrades the film as well.<br /><br />Anyway, I could have rated the film higher, but my heart goes with
HUGO, but who cares?
