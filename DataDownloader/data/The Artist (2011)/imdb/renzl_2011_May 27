Jean Dujardin deserved his Palme D&#x27;or for his captivating and wonderful
performance. Where to start...this film is so clever, so beautifully
crafted, so mesmerising. The lost art of the silent film is once again
brought to life and that era is impressively recreated, whether it be
the acting style, the sets, the locations (shot in Hollywood), the
shimmering black and white photography. It is obvious to see that the
people behind L&#x27;artiste respected that era of film making and wanted to
recreate the magic with some modern touches ( I won&#x27;t spoil them) and
totally succeeded. I saw this in Cannes at an 8.30 am press screening
and was totally entranced. I cannot wait to see it again!
