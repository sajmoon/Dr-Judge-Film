2011_December 27 
This was a very well done movie visually, but the story was simplistic
and predictable, and if you&#x27;re going to try and pull off a silent,
black &#x26; white movie in 2011, then it had better different from all the
other b/w movies that have been made before it. What makes this movie
special was that it was made in today&#x27;s age of in-your-face big special
effects and CGI bells and whistles, but in the end, it doesn&#x27;t stand
out as one of the great silent movies ever made. If you haven&#x27;t seen a
silent b/w movie before then don&#x27;t waste your time on this, see the
master -- see Chaplin. Chaplin is much more clever -- he offers
multiple story lines and brilliant, original comedy; amazingly fresh
after all this time.
