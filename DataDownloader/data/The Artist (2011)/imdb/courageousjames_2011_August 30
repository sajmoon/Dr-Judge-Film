I managed to catch a screening of this at Cannes, and if you&#x27;re
thinking about skipping this film because it&#x27;s silent and black and
white, you&#x27;re going to be missing out on a very special experience.<br /><br />Everything about this film is exceptional. The acting is top-notch, the
story is intriguing, and despite being black and white, the film is
visually appealing. The filmmakers really make great use of the medium,
and even though there are no voices or color, my interest was never
lost.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin gives a great performance. You like him instantly and,
without giving too much away, you want him to succeed. This movie is
really chock full of great actors and actresses. You&#x27;ll see some
familiar faces, but they all blend in well with the world of the film.<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t know a whole lot about the director Michel Hazanavicius,
but after seeing this film I&#x27;m definitely interested in seeing what he
does next.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
