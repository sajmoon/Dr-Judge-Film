There are a lot of good things about this film. The acting is good, and
the cinematography is good. And the dog is terrific. <br /><br />But something is missing: an interesting story. I saw this film in a
theater with less than 30 people watching. It&#x27;s not making a lot of
money. People are not very interested because there&#x27;s very little to
relate to here. <br /><br />The story is about a silent film star who refuses to make &#x22;talkies&#x22; and
whose career hits the skids as a result. Um, duh? Get a job? Make an
adjustment? Apparently the worst possible fate in the world is to not
be able to work as a movie star. <br /><br />It&#x27;s a shame because the main characters are likable. But there&#x27;s
almost no story here. The story that they do have is ridden with
mawkish over- simplicity.
