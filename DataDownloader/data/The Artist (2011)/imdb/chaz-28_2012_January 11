George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) has a dream halfway through The Artist
with real sound. He sets a glass down on the table and it makes a
noise. The phone rings, the dog barks, and it all sounds so harsh and
shrill. Both George and the audience wait for George to wake up and end
these horrible noises. Please, take us back to the wonderful world of
silent film in black and white whose only sound is the soothing
cinematic orchestral score. <br /><br />Yes, The Artist is silent. The actors are moving their mouths but only
every now and then does a dialogue screen pop up for the audience to
read. The effect of this throwback is a mesmerizing masterpiece. Just
as Hugo was homage to the earliest films and George Melies, The Artist
celebrates the late 1920s silent film era and appears so accurate it
most likely could have been released in 1927. The giveaway is that
everybody in the movie theater on screen is smoking. Nobody in Hugo&#x27;s
Parisian train station was smoking which is good for the kiddies, but
kills authenticity.<br /><br />George is the silver screen&#x27;s golden boy. His motion pictures make a
ton of money, the audience loves his swashbuckling heroes, and his
incredibly well-trained Jack Russell Terrier usually stars right along
side of him. Through a series of unlikely events, an aspiring actress,
a perfectly named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), appears on his studio
lot as an extra and they develop a noticeable level of chemistry
together, though there is no sign of adultery because this is 1927.
George is a married man and while he may be distant from his wife,
there will be no vow breaking here.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Singin&#x27; in the Rain, then you know what is
coming &#x96; the talkies. George takes one look at an early prototype of an
actress speaking on screen and laughs at is as a gimmick. Nothing could
replace silent film and besides, the audience, &#x22;his audience&#x22;, would
never stand for it. How wrong he is. Soon enough, studio boss Al Zimmer
(John Goodman) fires George choosing to begin the era of sound in film
with fresh faces, such as Peppy Miller.<br /><br />The depression strikes, George blows through his savings on one last
ditch attempt to save silent film, and he is done for. He is not alone
though, his reliable dog is with him as well as his now unpaid
chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell). Peppy is never far either. She
remembers who was responsible for her meteoric rise and is perhaps
playing some Fairy Godmother role in George&#x27;s life even though she is
much younger. <br /><br />The plot seems a bit thin and silly as I write this, but it comes
across as much deeper than it sounds. George and Peppy are wonderful on
screen together and The Artist is just so much fun to sit back and
watch. The doubters will naturally stay away from it no matter what
anybody writes; the combination of black and white and silence is just
too scary to think about sitting through even though this is leagues
above the common denominator.
