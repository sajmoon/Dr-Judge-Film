The Artist is a well-made if not particularly involving homage to the
silent films of the 1920s. The film itself looks beautiful, and makes
interesting use of its lack of sound. However, the story lacks
interest, and is as clich&#xE9;d as the silent films it pays tribute to.<br /><br />The artist of the title is George Valentin, a silent film star caught
in a loveless marriage to a petulant starlet. He gives a jump start to
the career of actress Peppy Miller after kissing her at a premiere.
However, he soon finds his stardom dwarfed by hers after the debut of
talkies and losing his fortune in the stock market collapse.<br /><br />The film is at its best when it plays with the whole concept of silent
movies. The most impressive example is a dream sequence conveying the
transition from silent to sound movies. Valentin dreams that his word,
previously filled with a silent movie soundtrack, now consumed by
overly loud background sounds. This may be the first time in cinematic
history in which a dog&#x27;s bark has conveyed the shift of an entire
world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of
silent films in general. Because of the lack of dialogue, The Artist
ultimately has a simplistic story with largely one dimensional
characters. To a large extent, the plot mimics that of A Star Is Born,
focusing on a famous performer ultimately surpassed by his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;. As
a result, the film is boring and predictable.<br /><br />Furthermore, the film emulates the least interesting of the silent
movies. Rather than focusing on the more experimental films that
characterized the early years of silent movies, such as The Cabinet of
Dr. Caligari and D. W. Griffith&#x27;s work, it looks at the making of genre
films. Given that The Artist, by its very nature, is aimed at film
buffs with an extensive set of references, one would think they would
give attention to more interesting films.<br /><br />Still, the film&#x27;s cast does a lot, particularly given the lack of
dialogue. Penelope Ann Miller gives Valentin&#x27;s harpy wife as much
dimension as one can to such a one note character. John Goodman is also
good as a dictatorial producer.
