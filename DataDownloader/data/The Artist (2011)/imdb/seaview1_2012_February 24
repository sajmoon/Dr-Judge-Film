The Artist is a little gem of a silent film that was shot in black and
white. This clever throwback to old Hollywood was the work of a French
production team with American support and headed by director Michel
Hazanavicius. Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make
his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale.
Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his
previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no
less. The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on
telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern
audiences.<br /><br />In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matin&#xE9;e idol
whose films are popular with the masses. At one Hollywood premier, he
shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a
fan, Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in
movies. George&#x27;s home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife
(Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile,
Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance
meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings
of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman). During a dance club
scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even
as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the
studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the
times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while
Peppy is a fast rising star. When the stock market crashes, Valentin is
ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly
lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.<br /><br />This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its
deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos. If that
sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don&#x27;t make
anymore, it&#x27;s because they haven&#x27;t for over eighty years! People who
respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic
silent films like Chaplin&#x27;s City Lights and The General by Buster
Keaton. The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other
masterworks.<br /><br />The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right
out of A Star Is Born. When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with
his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at
the dinner table in Citizen Kane. The scenes where the studio is
switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in
Singin in the Rain. The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic
relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master
from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone? <br /><br />Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly
in the playful main theme,it uses several minutes of a love theme from
Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Vertigo for a climactic sequence. It works just
fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s haunting score may
find it a tad annoying. There are also a couple brief instances when
actual sound is employed to great effect.<br /><br />There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James
Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline. There is a
sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands
wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on
display. And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the
bird in a silent film! <br /><br />Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clich&#xE9;s,
but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm
that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless
film wears off. And consider this-an engaging silent film with no
nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the
way to the Oscars.
