There&#x27;s a problem with the rating system, I&#x27;m not saying I can offer a
better one, but still. Here is a film with a script that&#x27;s not worthy
of all its other merits. I don&#x27;t mind the lack of originality too much,
but I find some holes in the plot annoying, mainly because this such a
great film it deserved better. There&#x27;s no need to excuse the black and
white, or the lack of speech in the film, not only because it makes
cinematic sense, it practically works for the film and improves it. The
cinematography is super, the acting is superb, with the two leads
excelling beyond everyone else, mostly because they do have great
characters written for them, but obviously also because they&#x27;re up for
the task.<br /><br />Go see this film, and try not to dwell too much on what&#x27;s missing in
the story, what we do get to see is so well done it makes up for it.
