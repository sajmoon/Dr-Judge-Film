You have heard it before! This movie draws comparisons to &#x22;A Star is
Born&#x22;, &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;, &#x22;City Lights&#x22; and in my opinion every
&#x22;Thin Man&#x22; movie that Asta was in. And speaking of &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the
Rain&#x22; did anyone notice the eerie resemblance to Jean Hagen in this
movie? Well, back to the dog! My wife is an animal lover and hates to
see movies where animals get hurt. Refueses to ever see &#x22;The Wizard of
Oz&#x22; and any &#x22;Lassie&#x22; movie. No need to worry about this movie. Uggie
the dog steals every scene he is in and plays an integral part in the
outcome of the movie. (Spoiler!) The &#x22;Bang&#x22; scene with the dog is quite
moving.<br /><br />Any awards given to this movie are much deserved. You will be
entertained and leave with a smile on your face. Oh, there are few
spoken words and just for you trivia people, Marcel Marceau does not
appear in the movie.
