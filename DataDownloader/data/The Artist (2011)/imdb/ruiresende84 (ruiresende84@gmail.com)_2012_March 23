We&#x27;ve seen things like this before, haven&#x27;t we? Films that are not
about films, but instead a love letter to other films. <br /><br />I&#x27;m not nearly as fascinated about such incursions as i am for anything
really new that comes out. As far as i know, the most fascinating
referenced cinema is the one that captures the lessons of great
previous films, and extends its notions a little bit. Or break them.
You have people, like the Coens or de Palma, who made a career twisting
the ideas of people before them. If we talk about silent films, than
Guy Maddin is someone who really picked up what we stopped caring about
with The Jazz singer, and twisted every notion to create something new.
That&#x27;s the kind of reference that i&#x27;m looking at with passion.<br /><br />This one enters the Cinema Paradiso drawer: expansive genuine passion
for a certain type or moment of cinema history, poured into a vessel of
nostalgia. You will understand these films if you understand that
nostalgia, not necessarily the films that it addresses. Unashamed
sweetness tops these attitude. You decide to play in that world or not.
I&#x27;ve entered it several times. But i don&#x27;t stay there more than a few
moments without feeling that i&#x27;m bypassing something really important,
in other films being made.<br /><br />That said, this one is a pretty good homage, in that flat sense. Some
elements work amazingly well here, and one is even interesting from a
cinematic point of view:<br /><br />the one thing that works incredibly well is the main male actor:
Whoever chose him understood his potential, he understood what it took
for a silent actor to live on screen, and the director definitely
understood his face, every angle of it. He smiles in a way that i&#x27;ve
seen very few times. That smile carries the film, when he doesn&#x27;t
smile, we easily enter the depressive mood of the character represented
by the absence of its actor&#x27;s smile. Actors representing actors is
something always interesting. To do it pretty much with a smile alone,
makes him worthy of the Oscar. By the way, he is always an actor on the
film. When he is acting for the silent films in the film, he has a
similarly camera aware attitude as when he is in the real world of the
film.<br /><br />The narrative unfolds around and is finished with films, of course.
That&#x27;s why our on screen lovers get together making a film, and his
love for her is reaffirmed by the scenes of another film they made
together. It&#x27;s the necessary self-reference, required for films like
this to work.<br /><br />And there is one remarkable scene. The &#x22;sound&#x22; dream. Our silent
character dreams the world gains sound, objects, everything starts to
produce sounds, except his own voice. This is remarkable because
nothing is explained, everything is in the eye. The mere editing of
simple sounds in an other than that silent scene makes us understand
the drama of this character on verge of extinction. That was a
cinematic moment.<br /><br />My opinion: 4/5
