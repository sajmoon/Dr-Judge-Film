This movie is an interesting art piece with a nice look at old
Hollywood. The silent aspect makes one watch carefully the emotions and
facial expressions. The story is simple and pleasantly predictable
about one star on the rise and one on the decline at the era when
silent films gave way to talkies.<br /><br />The plot of the first half is a bit frustratingly thin but the second
half the story picks up. The infamous use of music from Hitchcock&#x27;s
Vertigo is good - actually makes me want to see Vertigo again.<br /><br />Dujardin as Valentin the screen idol of the silent screen looks the
part. Berenice has a harder role acting wise. Both are good and dance
well. Nice use of John Goodman and Penelope Anne Miller.<br /><br />Compared to the other good movies that came out this year eg War Horse,
Midnight in Paris etc, the Artist isn&#x27;t quite as good. It&#x27;s only the
timing of the release and the continental background that have people
praising it beyond it&#x27;s worth. I don&#x27;t think it is best picture.
