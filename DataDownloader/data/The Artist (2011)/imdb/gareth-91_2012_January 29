2012_January 29 
I just saw this in Jan 2012 as I really didn&#x27;t want to miss is as it
has been portrayed as something &#x27;amazing&#x27;, as in extraordinary. I was
waiting to be blown away, and wasn&#x27;t.<br /><br />Lead George appears charming &#x26; deeply content with his life, but his
wife hates him &#x26; sits at home miserably with a face like a bag of
smashed tatties. If he is such a happy and satisfied guy, why haven&#x27;t
they sorted that out, they&#x27;re like a couple in their 70s waiting to
die.<br /><br />The dog is gorgeous, most grounded character in the movie. There&#x27;s a
very loyal chauffeur, who works free of charge for a year. Studio boss
is very quick to let George the silent movie star go, he just
disappears overnight after being mega-famous. Is Peppy very fond of
George and remembers how kind he was to her and is determined to return
the favour, or does she fancy him, as her behaviour could be seen as
that of a stalker. Then at the end they dance, the tap was OK, but was
that a waltz, OK, a 200 mile an hour spin round the room. It just left
me flat and bemused, no light bulb moments.
