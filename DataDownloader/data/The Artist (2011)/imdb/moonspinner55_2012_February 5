Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius&#x27; valentine to silent-era
Hollywoodland, circa 1927, wherein bright young women who were
fast-on-their-feet could find movie-work as extras, perhaps even meet a
genuine film star along the way. Filmed in flat black-and-white at the
&#x22;Academy ratio&#x22; of 1.33:1--with a modicum of sound and vocal effects,
but with a smashing score--&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a genuine oddity for modern
audiences, and may put some viewers off before the simple-but-sweet
plot unfolds. Hazanavicius himself is a bit hesitant in getting things
started, and an early scene with movie mogul John Goodman ordering
aspiring starlet B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo off the lot is just a series of cuts
back and forth without a grip on the narrative. Ludovic Bource&#x27;s score
(with an enormous tip of the hat to Bernard Herrmann) and Guillaume
Schiffman&#x27;s cinematography come to the rescue on several occasions, yet
it is the performances of the dashing Jean Dujardin as George Valentin
and the delightful Bejo as Peppy Miller who take the picture from
anomaly to a must-see (most especially for film-buffs). Embodying the
never-say-die qualities of early Hollywood before the stock market
crash, Dujardin pops off the screen like a cross between Fredric March
and John Gilbert (with the voice of Charles Boyer!). It is nearly
inconceivable that heretofore-unknowns, regardless of their talent,
could pull off an honest-to-God silent movie (presented in the correct
time and place) in the year 2011 and come up with results this lovely.
&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a black-and-white rose; it blossoms slowly, and in
virtual silence, but the bloom is unique and beautiful to behold.
