Somewhere in this unreasonable facsimile of and on silent filmmaking a
clip of Doug Fairbanks as Zorro appears for under 30 seconds. For the
the rest of the film I lamented the fact I wasn&#x27;t watching it instead
of this pale imitation of an homage to a mix and match variety of
silent fact and folklore. This corny clunker proves beyond doubt there
ain&#x27;t nothing like the real thing.<br /><br />George Valintin is one of silent films great leading men (Fairbanks)
that mocks the advent of sound before soon coming victim (Novarro,
Gilbert) to it. As his star falls ( Norman Maine) a dancer (Vickie
Lester) he once befriended and met in comical fashion riding a shooting
one takes him in. His pride gets the best of him however and he begins
to self destruct. Throughout it all his noble dog sticks to his side. <br /><br />The Artist is to be commended for its attempt to give later generations
a look at what it was like to see silents the way they were meant to
be. But after two visually impressive opening scenes the compositions
become mundane, the montage slow the prosaic storyline banal scraps of
classics including sound work from Welles, Lean, Chaplin and Berkeley.
When the film itself stubbornly hangs on to its&#x27; silent stance even
after the advent of sound it literally stalls and stunts itself, and
the idea becomes self defeating. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll do the cast a favor and mention no one beyond a charming Jean
Dujardin for no one merits it save the adorable dog who doesn&#x27;t need
much to steal scenes from these ensemble dullard humans who offer
little more than waxen posturing. They broadly parody the &#x22;ancient&#x22;
style of film acting but lack the faces and the nuance of the
originals. Director Michel Havavicius simply turns off the sound shoots
his film in black and white and shoots a clich&#xE9; ridden Singin&#x27; in the
Rain / A Star is Born hybrid and from the looks of it wondered if he&#x27;d
researched any silents at all.<br /><br />For the uninitiated to the silent era and the masterpieces from it The
Artist might be an exotic sea change from the impersonal computer
generated 3 D world of cinema today but if one truly wants to see it
done in all its antiquated magnificence then seek out theatre
screenings of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Gish, Lon Chaney, Vidor and
Griffith. The Artist is simply a slick repro with nothing under the
hood.
