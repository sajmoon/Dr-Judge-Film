Another movie that leaves me torn and divided. I will say right off
that I very much liked this film. Loved the performers and the
characters they played (Uggie the dog&#x85;if there isn&#x27;t an Academy Award
for him, there certainly should be!) However, in having said that, I
will say there was nothing original here. At all. There were echoes and
pieces of various and sundry old movies, many of them silent. You could
easily see Gene Kelley, who was handsome and could dance, but couldn&#x27;t
act his way out of a paper bag&#x85;and yet you loved him. I did. The lead
character, George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin was that character.
There is no way you could not like him - immensely. Berenice Bejo as
Peppy Miller, the ing&#xE9;nue with a heart of gold who makes it big, was
perfect and John Goodman&#x27;s Al Zimmer was one of Goodmans&#x27;s best. You
actually like him in this role. But movie of the year? Not likely. The
novelty of making a mostly silent film was different for this day and
age, but certainly nothing new. The plot was old and well-used,
predictable, even while it was being enjoyed. And again, I will say I
liked this movie, in spite of it all, probably will see it again. Do
see this, by all means. if for no other reason than to see what old,
silent movies were like. Because this is nothing more than a
compilation of a great many of them only with better actors and better
film.
