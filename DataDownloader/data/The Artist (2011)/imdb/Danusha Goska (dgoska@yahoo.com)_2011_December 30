&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a must-see for film fans. General audiences looking for
a charming, unconventional film with a charismatic star, deeply
romantic moments, and perhaps the cutest movie dog ever will enjoy it
as well. <br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a black-and-white, silent film about George Valentin, a
star whose career sinks when talking pictures arrive. It&#x27;s an homage to
Hollywood movies, but it&#x27;s also a good movie in its own right. Film
fans will pick up references to other films: plot points from &#x22;Singing
in the Rain&#x22; and &#x22;A Star is Born,&#x22; snips of music from &#x22;Vertigo,&#x22; a
reference or two to &#x22;Citizen Kane.&#x22; <br /><br />Jean Dujardin gives one of the most charismatic film performances ever
as Valentin. He is accompanied by Uggie, an utterly adorable Jack
Russell terrier. Fans are now campaigning for Uggie to receive a
special Academy Award. <br /><br />The love story between Valentin and up-and-coming starlet Peppy Miller
(Berenice Bejo) is told without words or sound, and yet the silent
telling is masterful, poignant, and articulate. &#x22;The coat scene&#x22; will
become a classic. The scene where Valentin and Peppy must dance with
each other on the set of a film called &#x22;A German Affair&#x22; tells the
viewer everything you need to know about this love story without
speaking a single word. Bejo is a beautifully quiet counterpart to
Dujardin&#x27;s more showy performance. <br /><br />The movie has fun with signs. When Miller does something kind for
Valentin, there is a movie poster in the background. The name of the
film: &#x22;Guardian Angel.&#x22; Ludovic Bource&#x27;s score is lush and diverse. He
quotes from classic film scores and is inspired by a variety of early
twentieth century popular music. <br /><br />The plot is a bit thin. The film hammers home how low Valentin sinks
after talking pictures push him out of the spotlight. At least one of
these many scenes could have been edited out (I vote for the scene
where Valentin fights with a miniature version of himself.) More
backstory could have been introduced for other characters. What on
earth happened to Valentin&#x27;s marriage? How did he and his wife ever end
up together? How did the introduction of sound affect John Goodman and
Malcolm McDowell, who are woefully underused? Otherwise, though, this
film is delightful, and it will be much loved.
