*A new era with old taste and new flavor* <br /><br />No wonder,why this movie bagged so many Oscars... This is the one of
the Academy&#x27;s best decisions.<br /><br />Wake up call to all the directors. We always don&#x27;t need too much of Hi
technology influenced movies all the times.<br /><br />Thanks to academy for not throwing such a great movie in &#x22;Foreign
Movie&#x22; category.<br /><br />Superbly performed by &#x22; Jean Dujardin as George Valentin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
Bejo as Peppy miller&#x22; Congratulations to Michel Hazanavicius &#x26; Team.
The dog should have received best animal performance :) <br /><br />Highly recommended to watch this movie with bucket full of pop corns -
but i hope you will not have time to eat or taste it once you have
started to see this storytelling movie.
