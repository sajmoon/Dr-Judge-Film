Having dabbled in the 1920s with &#x22;Midnight In Paris&#x22;, this movie will
immerse you in this classic decade. The cars, the clothes, the hair...
Director Michel Hazanavicius doesn&#x27;t miss a single beat. Even the
extras - every pedestrian and stagehand - has the classic familiarity
of your grandparents&#x27; yearbook. Even the top name character actors
filling in the cast as featured extras (Malcolm McDowell, Beth Grant,
Ed Lauter). Stars Jean Dujardin (looking more, at times, like Gene
Kelly) and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo fit perfectly into this era. All in all, it&#x27;s
like a lost reel straight from 1927.<br /><br />I grew up going to the local Silent Film Festival every spring, so my
hopes were high for &#x22;The Artist&#x22;; I can tell you, I was not
disappointed. It wasn&#x27;t a stylized homage (like, say, &#x22;Down With Love&#x22;)
or a technical exercise (Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &#x22;Psycho&#x22;), this was a 20s
period film all around. Like the indulgent &#x22;reality&#x22; of &#x22;Mad Men&#x22;, &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; is clouded with cigarette smoke, charmed with male chauvinism,
and shamefully lacking real roles for minorities; and at the same time,
full of G-rated romance and compelling melodrama.<br /><br />Michel Hazanavicius takes full advantage to his film&#x27;s lack of sound
and dialog, using title cards only when absolutely necessary. In fact,
one slightly jarring moment comes when we hear Rose Murphy singing
&#x22;Pennies from Heaven&#x22; over a montage. Slapstick and truly expressive
acting are illuminated instead. This, frankly, has been sadly absent in
movies lately. The most expressive performances coming from animated
characters like Wall-E and Caesar (&#x22;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&#x22;).<br /><br />One of the compelling (and melancholy) aspects of the plot is the shift
during the Great Depression from silent films to talkies. Though it is
the undertow of the lead&#x27;s story, it simultaneously self-conscious,
reminding us what a rare treat this movie really is.<br /><br />Like I said, Go see &#x22;The Artist&#x22;! Take someone who truly loves cinema
with you. Take your grandparents. This movie will transport you and
remind you why we love movies so much.
