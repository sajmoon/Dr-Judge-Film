for me its not the best film of the year but definitely refreshing. i
didn&#x27;t find anything extraordinary in the film as there is nothing that
hasn&#x27;t been done before but yes what i did enjoy the most is the last
15mins made up for the previous 1.5hrs, awesome ending, for me it ended
with climax. as for the music 10/10. acting 9/10. costumes 9/10. now
why i particularly enjoyed the movie was while i was seeing it i was
remembering all the great silent, black and white films i have seen
before...oh bringing back those memories is why i called it
refreshing.the reason behind my mixed review is, yes it is a good film
but is it what we call a classic, where for another 10years i will
repeatedly keep watching it? i didn&#x27;t think so.
