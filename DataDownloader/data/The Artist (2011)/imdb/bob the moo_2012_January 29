2012_January 29 
From a viewer&#x27;s point of view this time of the year is a blessing and a
curse. It is a blessing because so many good or worthy films are out in
the cinemas because the awards season is just arriving &#x96; so it sort of
works as the opposite end of the spectrum to the summer season where
all the &#x22;special effects&#x22; movies gather, December/January is where all
the potential award winners clump up. The downside of this is that some
of them can be overly worthy button pushers looking for awards in a
shameless way but also that genuinely good films can be over-hyped.
This unfortunately happened with The Artist &#x96; the praise was all at an
extreme so of course the backlash is equally extreme as people go
expecting the film to be the most perfect thing ever, only to find that
it is only a really good little film.<br /><br />And this is what The Artist is &#x96; a really good little film that tells a
simple story in an effective and charming way, using the device of
being a silent film to very good effect. I&#x27;m not sure what some of
those criticising it expected to see, but I guess it is hard to not be
disappointed whenever every poster on every bus and every review in
every newspaper seems to be suggesting it is the most brilliant thing
ever &#x96; which it isn&#x27;t. I really enjoyed it though and thought it was as
clever as it was simple, producing funny bits but also moments that I
was surprised they were as touching as they were. The plot sees a
Hollywood actor in the silent pictures at the top of his game who falls
on hard times when talkies see his fans deserting him &#x96; all as a young
starlet who he gave a break to rises in popularity thanks to her part
in the talkies. It is a simple story but it plays out very well and the
lack of dialogue really doesn&#x27;t hurt the film at all &#x96; it just helps
create the era for the viewer.<br /><br />It is never hilarious but it is consistently amusing but of more
surprise to me was how moving and sensitive it was - the story is
simple but yet it engages and charms. The cast are a big part of this
because they give performances that match the &#x22;big expression&#x22; nature
of silent film acting but they also deliver in the smaller moments so
that it is not just the words they are saying that they show, but also
their feelings and thoughts. Dujardin in particular does so much
without a single word and I very much enjoyed how he led the film.
Likewise Bejo is very OTT in her expression but manages to make it work
while also being charming and natural at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure
why faces like Goodman, Cromwell, Pyle, McDowell and others were all in
here but they were nice finds in supporting roles. As director and
writer Hazanavicius has done a great job and he deserves his Oscar
nominations for this.<br /><br />Overall The Artist is a lovely little film with a simple story that is
told with invention, wit and charm. No matter how many awards it wins
it will not cure you of your diseases or change how you approach life &#x96;
so if you walk in with that expectation because of the hype then you
will be disappointed, but come to it for what it is and you will find
that it easily charms and entertains you.
