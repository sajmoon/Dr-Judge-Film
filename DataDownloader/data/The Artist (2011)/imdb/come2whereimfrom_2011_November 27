I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t enjoyed a film as much as I did &#x27;The
Artist&#x27; in a long time; from start to finish this movie is absolutely
superb. From the attention to detail in recreating the era of silent
movies (it&#x27;s black and white and even presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
to the mesmerising acting, it is a loving homage that can&#x27;t fail to
entertain and charm. Dujardin, in a surely Oscar winning performance,
is George Valentin a silent movie actor, who along with his dog
(another scene stealing performance) is a big star, so what could
possibly go wrong? Well the invention of the talkies and its rising
starlet Peppy Miller (Bejo). Not only does George have a hand in the
discovery of Peppy but he also falls madly in love with her. As her
ascension continues Georges fame wanes and after a failed attempt to
hold onto the old ways he admits defeat and becomes washed up, an
outdated relic in a medium that&#x27;s embracing the future. With amazing
cinematography from Guillaume Schiffman it&#x27;s a joy to watch as it
recreates perfectly the films and feel of the time and while cleverly
presenting a traditional love story it is both gripping and fascinating
to watch. The music also goes a long way to help give it the desired
effect as, apart from two scenes with sound, that is all you hear. In
an age where we talk about the death of cinema and gimmicks like 3D are
trying to woo audiences it&#x27;s just so refreshing to see something that
not only has a story but lacks the CGI that Hollywood so readily relies
on. It was apparently the directors dream project and it shows but it
was also clearly a labour of love for everyone involved making &#x27;The
Artist&#x27; simply one of the best films you&#x27;ll see all year.
