Take &#x27;A Star is Born&#x27;, throw in a bit of &#x27;Singin in the Rain&#x27; and a
touch too of &#x27;Sunset Boulevard&#x27;. Keep all the clich&#xE9;s and throw out any
real plot development, and you have this fairly flat souffl&#xE9; which just
refuses to rise. It&#x27;s supposed to be an homage to silent movies but is
way short of the best of that genre. It could have been worthwhile if
the script had contained either more wit or more real emotion .. in
this one, everyone seems just to be going through the motions, though I
must confess that the star, Jean Dujardin, does his best with the lame
material. An Oscar chance? It shows how far cinema has regressed almost
85 years after the introduction of the talkies!
