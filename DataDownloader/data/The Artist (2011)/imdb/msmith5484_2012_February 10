The Artist is a wonderful movie. I can&#x27;t say too many good things about
it. It is funny, sweet, endearing, sad and lovely. I&#x27;m surprised at how
moved I was. The leads (Jean Dujardin &#x26; Berenice Bejo) radiate charm,
you can&#x27;t help but root for them even when his pride get the best of
him and she gets a little big-headed. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but Jean
Dujardin reminded me a little of Gene Kelly. Uggie (the dog) is
marvelous - I don&#x27;t know why he hasn&#x27;t been nominated. I would call it
a &#x27;movie lovers movie&#x27;, it has nods (or maybe winks) to &#x27;Sunset
Boulevard&#x27;, &#x27;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x27; and &#x27;The Mark of Zorro&#x27;. Although
this is a silent movie, there are moments of sound playfully executed.
The story is relatively simple - how does an established star cope when
trends and technology change faster then he wishes they would? There
are a couple of nits I could pick, but why? Please do yourself a favor
and see it.
