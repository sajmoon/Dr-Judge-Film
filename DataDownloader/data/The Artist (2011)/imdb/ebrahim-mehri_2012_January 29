&#x22;The Emperor Has no Clothes&#x22;. Don&#x27;t be charmed of positive critics.
They admire it only because they want to prove that they can see what
others can not, unaware of the fact that there is nothing to see here.
Being different does not mean being best. The plot is very simple and
boring. This film was intended to be romance, comedy, drama. But it is
none. Believe me, people&#x27;s flavor is changed in this 80 years. People
like color visual effects, entertaining plots, thrill, or at least
getting good feeling from them. They like films like &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22; or
&#x22;Shawshank Redemption&#x22;; not old-fashioned archaistic works. Do yourself
a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money and precious time, unless you want
to fall asleep!
