2012_February 26 
In a time where millions are spent developing stupid &#x22;3d&#x22; televisions
and equipment to films in &#x22;3d&#x22; these guys come around and steal the
show with a black and white and mute film. <br /><br />Some people are in for a cultural shock, others simply won&#x27;t get it.
Isn&#x27;t the message clear? Technology should be to the service of
brilliant scenarios, directing and music. <br /><br />Overall this movie gave me hope that serious art will eventually reach
the mass and we will leave behind our current era of superficiality. <br /><br />From a certain point of view, this movie brings post-modern art to the
movie-watching masses. Being in black and white and the
re-contextualization of the thematic elements makes it more than a
simple homage. I am unsure if it&#x27;s been done this successfully before;
while Postmodernism has proliferated in contemporary music and art for
a good 30-40 years now, in cinema it has largely been avoided,for
commercial reasons. It is simple and charming, far from pretentious,
slightly contemporary in its presentation, and certainly deserve its
awards.<br /><br />Brilliant acting too by the way. I don&#x27;t need to say more, just go see
for yourself.
