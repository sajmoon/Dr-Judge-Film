This is an example of &#x22;The Emperors New Clothes&#x22;. Everyone is secretly
thinking &#x22;Why does everyone else like this?&#x22;, but is afraid to say it
aloud. Yes, it is a an OK film. But it is not the movie that everyone
proclaims it to be, certainly not worthy of the Oscar nominations it
has garnered. This is the same pretentiousness that catapulted Roberto
Benigni and his ridiculous &#x22;Life Is Beautiful&#x22; into unwarranted
success. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a movie that screams &#x22;Look at me. I am so
quirky&#x22; while all the while obfuscating the fact that the film is
devoid of substance. David Lynch was a master at this. Don&#x27;t waste your
time on a film that was reformatted to black &#x26; white because it was
irrelevant in color. It is still irrelevant!
