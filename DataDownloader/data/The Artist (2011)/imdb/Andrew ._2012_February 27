Finally the Oscar goes to a good movie. Kind of Ironic it is French and
silent. But it is very touching. First of all, it has something that
the recent movies of Hollywood lack: a good story that is well told.
Not only did they have a good plot, excellent cast, a &#x22;four legged
actor&#x22;, but they also manage to tell the story in a comprehensive way
with the right amount of details to depict the life ( from glory to
downfall and then back to an emerging career again ) of the main
character. It has also brought fun back to the big screen, a romantic
story without being too dramatic and yet able to capture the atmosphere
of that changing time. It is a truly remarkable production, something
we did not see for a long time in the big screen. I just can thank all
of those who got involved in this project and truly believe that the
seventh art is beyond mere special effects ( which are important, of
course, but should not be considered as the sole reason of making a
movie, as it has been lately ) &#x96; Thank God it is NOT in 3D !! - I know
the movie industry is going through changes nowadays. Perhaps the
answer is in the past, as it concerns which direction it should take..
Anyways, it&#x27;s a great movie and the art is back to the Theaters !!!
