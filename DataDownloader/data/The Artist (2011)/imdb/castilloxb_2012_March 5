i should have know better, there was maybe 3 other couples in there
60&#x27;s watching this show i wanted to leave in the first 20 mins of the
movie but only stayed because one of my friends liked it. I don;t care
what the Oscars and everyone else have to say. For me this was the
worst movie i have ever seen. a complete waste of time and money. The
best part of the movies was the ending so i could get out of there AND
COMPLAIN TO MY FRIEND HOW I WOULD NEVER TRUST HER TO PICK OUT A MOVIE
AGAIN. SO YEAH i hated it dumbs down and i have nothing else to say but
the stupid review makes me write 10 lines just wanted to put my little
input in it. sorry
