After watching &#x22;The Artist&#x22; for 1 hour I walked out of the theater. I
was so bored and irritated that I preferred to stretch my legs in fresh
air. Here are the reasons I have given this movie a rating of 3 out of
10: <br /><br />(1) Visually, the movie is grainy and blurry. There was no need to
subject the audience to such awful cinematography. The fact that the
movie is in black &#x26; white is not an excuse to avoid employing modern
techniques. Since the movie is without color, I had expected the
director to compensate by making the movie visually striking. After
all, black &#x26; white can be used to tremendous effect. Unfortunately,
this is not the case here. Scenes, lighting, props, etc. are visually
uninteresting.<br /><br />(2) The movie insults the intelligence of a modern audience. It&#x27;s
insulting because it beats us over the head with one single message --
that the silent film actor is on his way out. We are presented with
scene after scene that re-reminds us of this fact. I left the theater
after the scene in which people are walking on top of photos of the
main actor&#x27;s face (on a flyer for his failed movie). OK, we got that
message 30 minutes earlier. Isn&#x27;t there anything else?<br /><br />(3) The movie has minimal plot. Yes, the silent film actor is on his
way out. We get that, but that is all that this movie presents to us in
the first hour. <br /><br />(4) When compared to the good silent films of the 1920s, this film
comes up sorely lacking. It has none of the thrilling scenes, dramatic
acting, comedy, etc. of those films (at least for the first hour)<br /><br />(5) It is ironic that the movie is (in a very shallow way) about how
talkies replaced silent films and here we are, stuck watching a boring
silent film! It is also ironic that the only interesting scene is the
one in which some sound is introduced.<br /><br />(6) The music sound track is also very boring and unimaginative. <br /><br />(7) I think it is fine to have grainy, blurry visuals, and bad acting
when the movie is depicting scenes that are being filmed by the film
company of that era. But when a scene shifts to something happening to
the main character off-stage, then we should not be treated to the same
blurry cinematography and bad acting.<br /><br />Once I realized that I was horribly bored and that my intelligence was
being insulted, and that I didn&#x27;t care what happened to any of the
characters (and, except for the main character, the others are all
one-dimensional) then I knew I had to leave the theater. <br /><br />What amazes me is that this movie is getting such high ratings.
