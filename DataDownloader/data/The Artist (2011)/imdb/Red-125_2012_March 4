The Artist (2011) was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius. <br /><br />It&#x27;s awkward to give a lukewarm review to a film that&#x27;s received
multiple Oscars, and carries a impressive IMDb rating of 8.4.
Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie.<br /><br />It was a stroke of genius to conceive of making a silent film in the
21st Century. All credit to director Hazanavicius for that. However,
the manner in which the concept was carried out left me somewhat bored
and disappointed.<br /><br />The Artist touches on a situation that we&#x27;ve seen before--the
trajectories of a young woman and an older man cross as she is going up
and he is going down. (Think of &#x22;A Star is Born.&#x22;) So, that&#x27;s a
somewhat tired concept. Hiding it behind the &#x22;great silent star, but
couldn&#x27;t make the transition to talkies&#x22; doesn&#x27;t cover up the fact that
the plot is an old one.<br /><br />Also, the director has chosen to make the film not just silent, but in
the less-than-subtle style of many silent films. It&#x27;s purposely obvious
and melodramatic. I respect the thinking behind the decision, but I
don&#x27;t enjoy watching obvious, melodramatic movies--silent or with
spoken dialog.<br /><br />Finally, the film is 10 or 15 minutes too long in my opinion. Some
judicious editing might have improved it.<br /><br />The two stars, Jean Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo are very good. Ms. Bejo
is very beautiful by 21st Century standards, but manages to also look
beautiful in a way that would have worked 80 years earlier. It&#x27;s
difficult to comment on the acting, because the actors are in a new
movie where they have to act like actors in an old movie. That&#x27;s hard
to manage, and hard to evaluate. <br /><br />All in all, this is a movie worth seeing because it&#x27;s unique. Just
don&#x27;t go to it expecting more than the film can provide. We saw it on a
large screen, in the restored Star Theatre in Dansville, NY. The Star
was built in 1921, and did, indeed screen silent movies. The theater
ambiance helped me enjoy the film. However, The Artist will work well
in a cineplex or on the small screen.
