I have never written a review of a current film, but if there ever was
one that deserved the time it takes to input this, THE ARTIST is it!
It&#x27;s outrageously terrific and the film-makers deserve 10/10 for their
audacity. Jean Dujardin is wonderful in the role of a silent screen
star and the sets, costumes and ambiance are very true to the period.
There are many memorable - in fact, unforgettable - moments in this
gem. At a screening in Los Angeles, John Goodman said that, like in
silent films, the actors were improvising dialog as they went but
because Dujardin and Bejo were speaking in French and Goodman in
English, it was very difficult to concentrate. Bejo added that director
Hazanvicius had music playing during filming. Hazanavicius has shown
from his homage to the O.S.S. spy films of the 60&#x27;s, that he can
recreate filmic styles. THE ARTIST was a much more difficult venture.
To even attempt a silent black and white film is completely
counter-intuitive in today&#x27;s marketplace, but trust the French to pull
it off! The bottom line is - it REALLY WORKS.
