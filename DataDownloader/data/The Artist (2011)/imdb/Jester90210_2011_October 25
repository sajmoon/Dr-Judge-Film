I go to a lot of screenings and it is rare that once the credits roll I
feel satisfied. One or more of the elements of most films just don&#x27;t
work together to create a feeling that you have been thoroughly
entertained.<br /><br />I am happy to say that this film DELIVERS! The acting is superb, the
chemistry between all of the actors is sizzling, the comedy is
absolutely hilarious, the storyline grips you and never lets go, the
music is superb, and you feel emotionally connected with the characters
and story.<br /><br />If you check my previous reviews, you will see that I am most often
moved to write a review when a film was really bad, but this film
caught me completely off guard and I just had to express my
overwhelming satisfaction with this filmmaking experience.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult it must have been to try and finance a
period film with two stars who were not well known outside of their own
country. I am just overjoyed that it all came together. This is how
film should make you feel when you leave the theater - entertained! To
the entire production team - BRAVO!!
