Yikes! I was expecting something more to the plot from such an Oscar
winning movie. Sure, they nailed the look of old B&#x26;W movies of that era
but that novelty soon wears thin with the simplistic story line I had
to endure with four others in my small town local theater. I mean the
&#x22;Munsters&#x22; TV series nailed &#x27;30&#x27;s era B&#x26;W with better plots told in 30
minutes.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; only ran one short week in my small town Texas theater
ONLY AFTER it won the Oscar for Best Picture before it was quickly
replaced by newer releases. <br /><br />The long wait and heavy media buzz may have unrealistically raised my
expectations but I don&#x27;t think so even if it is considered an homage to
the history of cinema which is sort of ironic since silent movie&#x27;s had
to rely heavily on a well written story with intricate and compelling
relationships and plot lines to keep audience&#x27;s attention for over an
hour. <br /><br />Just read some IMDb story lines to a number of Lon Chaney flicks they
could&#x27;ve borrowed from like &#x22;The Unknown&#x22;, &#x22;Unholy Three&#x22;, and &#x22;The
Penalty&#x22;. They&#x27;re more involved and complex than what&#x27;s shown at most
Sundance Festivals. <br /><br />&#x22;The Unknown&#x22; left me dropped jawed throughout most of the movie
because I couldn&#x27;t believe the level of intelligence written into and
acted out in the story line. There were some really smart folks writing
and producing silent movies back in the &#x27;20&#x27;s and &#x27;30&#x27;s. &#x22;The Artist&#x22;
makes them out to be innocent dolts.<br /><br />You want to award an Oscar to a movie that pays homage to cinema? Give
it to Scorcese&#x27;s &#x22;Hugo&#x22; which was a much better and more entertaining
movie in my opinion.
