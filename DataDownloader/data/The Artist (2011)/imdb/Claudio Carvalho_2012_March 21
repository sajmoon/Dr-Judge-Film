In 1927, in Hollywood, the star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the
pride and joy of the president of the Kinograph Studios Al Zimmer (John
Goodman) and worshiped by a legion of fans. Among them is Peppy Miller
(B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo), who stumbles into George Valentin after the premiere
of a silent film. Peppy kisses George on his face and the photographers
take pictures of them.<br /><br />On the next morning, the headlines of the newspapers are &#x22;Who is that
girl?&#x22; and Peppy is selected in a dancing audition to be an extra in a
film. Along the next years, Peppy climbs positions in the Kinograph
Studios until the event of the talking pictures. The proud George
Valentin does not believe on the talkie, breaks off with the studio and
decides to produce and direct a silent film. The film is a complete
failure and with the Great Depression, George Valentin falls and is
bankrupted. Meanwhile Peppy Miller rises as new star of Kinograph
Studios. But she never forgets her idol George Valentin.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is an irresistible and heartbreaking tribute to the end of
the era of the silent films. This masterpiece was awarded with five
Oscars (best film, direction and actor in a lead role, costume design
and music score) and another 102 wins and 70 nominations and really
deserves all the hype surrounding it. <br /><br />The unknown Jean Dujardin is fantastic in the role of a man without
humility and vision to accept the new. The charm of the also unknown
B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo is irresistible and her lovable character is wonderful.
But the dog Uggie really steals the film. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;O Artista&#x22; (&#x22;The Artist&#x22;)<br /><br />Note: On 26 March 2012, I saw this extraordinary film again.
