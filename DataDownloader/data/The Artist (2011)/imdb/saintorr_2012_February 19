I haven&#x27;t posted a review on IMDb for a long while but I feel I need to
post a comment on this movie.<br /><br />All the reviews I have read suggest this is a certainty for a big Oscar
haul and it almost swept the board at the Baftas.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t get it. The film had nothing new to say and for long spells I
was bored.<br /><br />Dujardin looks good and he can dance, Bejo looks great and can really
dance but these performances can&#x27;t justify all the enthusiasm
surrounding this movie.<br /><br />If you have seen &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22; and &#x22;Sunset Boulevard&#x22; (and I&#x27;m
certain you have), don&#x27;t waste your time on The Artist. It tries to
tell the same story as these classics without the charm.
