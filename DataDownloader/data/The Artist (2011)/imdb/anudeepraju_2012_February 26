The Artist takes you decades back to only make you realize why you love
movies.The charismatic Jean Dujardin and the effervescent Berenice Bujo
are surely the best elements of the movie.The chemistry between Jean
and Bujo is another facet which surely adds on to the beauty of the
movie. A very mesmerizing screenplay and direction by Michael
Hazanavicius only keeps the viewers asking for more.The music and the
cinematography has also been effectively brilliant.In short the movie
is simple and has that element of humbleness that makes it so very
fascinating.The Artist is surely a tribute to that golden era of cinema
where movies made in the heart of the filmmaker.
