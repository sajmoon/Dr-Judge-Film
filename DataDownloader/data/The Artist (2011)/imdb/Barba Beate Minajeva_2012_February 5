The Oscar nominations are out. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a nominee for Best Film
besides 7 other movies. When I watched the trailer I got really
intrigued and decided to see it as soon as possible.<br /><br />Although, I expected it too be a mega-hit movie from the start, it
didn&#x27;t quite satisfy my so called hypothesis before watching the movie.
I must say, it was a pleasant change to see a black and white, silent
movie and the music was superb. But the plot was one of the most common
and I feel as if I have seen something similar before. Maybe it&#x27;s just
looking from my point of view but I expected some tragedy, unexpected
events, mystery. Something I didn&#x27;t expect to see when I watched &#x22;Black
Swan&#x22; last year.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the actors were great. Especially, I liked the leading
actress because I believe she has a so called actors face - with a lot
of appealing facial expressions.<br /><br />Taking the fact that this movie is nominee of 10 Oscars I believe that
the big guys really love it. And even if I don&#x27;t admire it so much, I
would still recommend you to see it, just for comparing of opinions.
And the end seen was terrific!
