It should be made clear: many consider this film to be the best of the
year. Masterfully made, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; soars in just about every
redeeming quality thinkable: character development, exceptional acting,
etc. It&#x27;s difficult to talk about such a masterpiece without including
a string of compliments. Actors in the film mostly use gestures and
expressions rather than words, but it is still clear how they feel
about something. It&#x27;s full of surprises and is primarily a romance
story, although it contains just as much comedy and drama. In one
instance, music from the score of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &#x22;Vertigo&#x22; is
used, but it ends up still fitting well with the scene it accompanies.
There&#x27;s really no reason to not see this, and there&#x27;s a perfect reason
it received an avalanche of prestigious awards.
