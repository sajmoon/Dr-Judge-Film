The movie is a mix between The Call of Cthulhu (2005), Ed Wood (1994),
Chaplin (1992) and Sunset Blvd. (1950). It takes place around 1930 and
tells the story of silent movie star that has to deal with the
introduction of film sound and talking movies. The movie itself is made
like a silent movie from that period and the technical side is great
(although they didn&#x27;t go so far as The Call of Cthulhu did in &#x22;aging&#x22;
the film; also, notice that only the early scenes are sped-up a bit
like the old movies).<br /><br />The entire production value is excellent (scenery, clothing, makeup,
cars, houses), making the movie feel very authentic right from the
start. Solid direction, good cast and excellent score (totally deserves
the Golden Globe it got). My only complaint is that movie didn&#x27;t
maintain the amount of interest I felt in its beginning; I don&#x27;t know
if I should blame the script or the director, but more than once I felt
that I&#x27;m losing my interest. Perhaps some scenes were just too long.<br /><br />IMHO this movie doesn&#x27;t come close to the level of Ed Wood, but all in
all it&#x27;s a good film and I recommend it.<br /><br />5.5/10 Recommended
