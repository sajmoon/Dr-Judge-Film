I am a big fan of The Thin Man series, and connected instantly with
Valentin&#x27;s pencil thin mustache, cocky little smirk (in the first half
of the movie), and the dog! Of course, the story line is very
different. It is a simple story really. Boy at the pinnacle of his
career meets struggling girl and gives her a helping hand. Then boy
meets girl once again, this time as he is going downhill and she is
climbing up. This midpoint is captured rather literally although still
prettily on the screen with a set of staircases with Valentin coming
down after a disappointing business meet and an upbeat Peppy bouncing
up the steps. I won&#x27;t go on with the rest of the story so as not to
play a spoiler. It is an old fashioned love story - you will come out
with a broad smile. <br /><br />A note on B&#x26;W silent cinema - no sound, little animation or special FX
- with so little to work with, the best directors of the time wove
magic on the screen. And this retro gem of a movie does the same.
Comedy, drama, and romance all come together in a clever mix. The
acting was top notch - the two main actors were superb. The movie swept
me up and took me back in time into the 1920s and 1930s Hollywood as
old superstars of the silent era gave way to the new talking stars.<br /><br />Catch it in the movie halls if you can.
