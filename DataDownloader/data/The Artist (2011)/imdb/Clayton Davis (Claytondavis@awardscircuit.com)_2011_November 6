When witnessing the evolution of film, it&#x27;s hard to grasp how it went
from a seemingly simple concept of silent imagery into a loud,
uproarious third dimension experience. Michel Hazanavicius&#x27; silent film
The Artist plays homage to the origins of our cinema in a general
manner while attaining a massive respect that can&#x27;t be denied. The film
tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film actor
megastar who withers away into obscurity when the introduction of
&#x22;talkies&#x22; meets monumental popularity. Movie extra Peppy Miller
(B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo) is a star on the rise who&#x27;s admiration for George&#x27;s
work runs much deeper than the film&#x27;s they share. Writer/Director
Michel Hazanavicius explores the deepest parts of his soul which he
calls &#x22;a love letter.&#x22; What a beautiful letter it was. He makes
conscious choices to illustrate the medium in the most toxic and potent
fashion. A Q &#x26; A with Hazanavicius&#x27; at the end of the picture placed
much into perspective. His funny, mild-tempered personality will carry
him extremely far in this year&#x27;s Oscar race. He could easily be the new
director that everyone roots for. His stamp on the film is evident and
his adoration and tribute to the genre is clear and ostentatious.<br /><br />Dujardin and Bejo showing Oscar all they got... The obvious question is
how does the silence work and is it done well? Tying in with the
prominent theme of silence, the presentation is an absolute marvel.
Hazanavicius&#x27; respect for film bleeds out the screen into the audience
and with so little words, we are transported into a world of unspoken
expressions and explosive representation. The narrative is so uniquely
relevant and intricately precise, that every scene is as equally
important as the one before it. There&#x27;s no fluff just brilliance.
Production design by Laurence Bennett alters the viewer&#x27;s perception of
reality and engages a time travel experience to Hollywood 1927. The
sets are so imaginative and exquisite, the film runs like a hybrid of
classic films like Rebecca (1940) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).
Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman shoots the film with a modern
camera but attacks each scene with finesse and diligence like an old
pro. He captures some of the best shots seen this year on film.
Hazanavicius not only writes and directs this triumphant piece of
cinema, he dips his hand into the editing process with Anne-Sophie
Bion. The duo know their pace and they know when to give more and pull
back. At 100 minutes of pure cinematic magic, it&#x27;s one of the rare
instances in film where it begins and ends perfectly. Bringing to light
the gorgeous production design, the gray whirlwind images shoots the
costume design by Mark Bridges to the forefront. Bridges captures
sharply the essence of time especially with Peppy&#x27;s wardrobe. An awards
magnet indeed. The star of the technical show is Ludovic Bource, a
composer that just catapulted himself into the big leagues as composers
John Williams and Alexandre Desplat. In a silent film, the music is
important and needs to be on queue every second. Bource knows when to
play it rough and especially when to retreat and let the film speak for
itself. It&#x27;s not overkill in the slightest. The supporting players,
which American audiences will know more than our two polarizing leads,
are effective in their respective roles. John Goodman proves to be the
strongest of the players, ripping through scenes of comedic brilliance
and showing that he still has everything in his armor. Penelope Ann
Miller, an underused and undervalued actress during her prime returns
to form as the beautiful Doris, a brokenhearted housewife looking for
some attention. James Cromwell plays Clifton, the &#x22;Alfred-type&#x22; driver
to Dujardin&#x27;s &#x22;Bruce Wayne,&#x22; a tantalizing and endearing performer that
shakes the hearts of the viewers. Malcolm McDowell shows brief but
subtle showmanship. The Artist is the year&#x27;s finest and most wonderful
film. The Academy Awards can stop looking, this is their winner for
Best Picture 2011. A fine piece of cinema that will hopefully be
clutched by moviegoers for years to come.
