Well, in all likelihood The Artist is going to win the Best Picture
Oscar in a few hours time. Does it deserve to win it?<br /><br />For anyone that doesn&#x27;t know The Artist is a silent film that follows
the progress of two stars George Valentin and Peppy Miller as talkies
are introduced to the movie world. George was a big star of the silent
era and Peppy becomes a big star of the new talking pictures. George
finds it difficult to make the transition though and his career hits
the doldrums.<br /><br />The film is fairly entertaining, but I must confess to loving dialogue
in movies. All of my favourite films contain great dialogue, so I found
it a bit frustrating that the film didn&#x27;t contain any words. It is
undoubtedly very well done though. Even though the film wasn&#x27;t really
my cup of tea I must confess that it probably does deserve the Oscar
for it&#x27;s originality and execution.
