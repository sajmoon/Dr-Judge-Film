Amazing - There&#x27;s really no reason to go beyond that, but IMDb asks for
a minimum of 10 lines, so I&#x27;ll fill the rest in with gushing hyperbole.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin is just fantastic as a cross between Gene Kelly and
Douglas Fairbanks Sr. The dog? What can you say about that dog? Or
those dogs (there were three of them)? They are the canine equivalent
of Jackie Coogan. Bejo, Goodman, Cromwell and Miller were so
expressive. I haven&#x27;t stopped smiling since I saw it - and that&#x27;s what
films were supposed to do in the silent era. OK, that&#x27;s about 10 lines.
So let&#x27;s get back to basics - the film is an amazing display of
filmmaking and a total joy.<br /><br />How cool will it be to have a silent b&#x26;w film win the Oscar for Best
Pic?
