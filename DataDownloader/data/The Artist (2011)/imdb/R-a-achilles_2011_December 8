If you really fancy silent movies from long long ago en do not mind the
lack of sounds in general en lack of voices from people talking to each
other and you like the thin story&#x27;s from 80 years back you must see
this film. If not you will probably find this movie terribly slow and
non dramatic. Drama is normally (among others) built around or grounded
in sounds and voices. That&#x27;s why the introduction of movies with voices
was such a huge step forward! The Artist is really an almost complete
silent movie with storyboards (!) tot tell the story. For reasons
unexplained, the spectator is brought back in history, between
1927-1935. Not by the story which is situated about 80 years ago, but
by the philmographic techniques. No zoom, no sound (except some music,
which is OK), black and white, storyboard, etc. Thus it is very
difficult, if not impossible to connect with the characters. Characters
are also cardboard and the story is very simple and flat, as in more
movies about 80 years old. With a running time of 100 minutes the movie
is too long or at least feels far too long. I found the movie very
boring. It is certainly not the best movie from this year&#x85;&#x85;
