2012_February 25 
Out of the 10 nominated films this year, i think this is my least
favourite. i don&#x27;t understand all the praise that has been heaped upon
it, except to say that maybe movie lovers might love it, but this one
did not care for it. This film has a simple, very simple plot. The
silent era of film is at a close and the talkies are taking over. Thank
God! Without talking there is not much for writers to write. The actors
were good at expressing the actions, especially the little dog, but i
prefer dialog in my films. i want to hear how people resolve the
conflicts in their lives. The Artist feels like a mash-up between
Singing in the Rain and silent films from the 20&#x27;s. As for The Oscar,
please give it to The Help or Moneyball or War Horse. And for actor,
Brad Pitt, an actor that used words and expressions.
