In Hollywood&#x27;s silent movie era of the 1920s, a movie star realizes
that pictures where the actors can talk will destroy his career. Then
he meets a dancer and the plot thickens!<br /><br />Writer and director: Michel Hazanavicius creates an absolutely
entertaining, and early era romantic atmosphere with The Artist. The
movie&#x27;s lead actor, Jean Dujardin, is not only sympathetic to watch (no
easy task without the benefit of a speaking role), but also gives a
very fine performance. I loved the music in this movie. I&#x27;m not sure if
I will have the same experience, but the music kind of makes me want to
see other silent movies that actually came from that era!<br /><br />Prior to the Academy awards, I had seen about three interviews with
Harvey Weinstein. It seems that, if not for his actions, The Artist
would never have been so widely released and would never have made it
to the awards show. I feel that there should have been more shout outs
to him, each time The Artist received an award.<br /><br />But, having said that, I still enjoyed the movie very much.
