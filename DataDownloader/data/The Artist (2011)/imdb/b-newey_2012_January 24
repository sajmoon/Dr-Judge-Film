The words in the title of this review are just some of the ones that
you might find yourself using after watching this film.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to describe how oddly simple and oddly amazing this
film is. I was excited to go and see it 1. because it was nominated for
so many Oscars and 2. that it was playing in 2 theaters in the City of
Toronto right now. I can&#x27;t believe how lucky I was to be able to see
this at the Cineplex Varsity Cinema. I won&#x27;t go into too much detail
about the theatre but let&#x27;s just say that the auditoriums themselves
are very..intimate. There&#x27;s maybe 100 seats in the theatre! Very tiny
auditoriums. This is all relevant to the review though because, even
though I was excited to go and see The Artist, walking into the
auditorium was a bit of a let down.<br /><br />This feeling was short lived though. As soon as the lights went down
and the movie began I instantly realized that this type of auditorium
was probably the best way to watch this film in. Just everything about
it. The movie really gives off that old school silent film vibe
(obviously) and being in a very intimate setting made me forget about
2012 and made me pretend to be in the early 1900&#x27;s.<br /><br />And that is another thing. This film forces you to
insert-your-emotion-here many times. It knows exactly what it wants
from the audience. This is obviously due to the fact that it is a
silent film but the point I am trying to make is that it sucks you into
it&#x27;s story and everything with immense grace. I and many around me when
I looked the odd time had a smile on our faces for nearly the entire
film. You don&#x27;t quite get this pleasure as much anymore in this modern
day so I was pleasantly surprised and knew from the start that I would
likely be smiling like a fool for the whole film!<br /><br />I walked into the theatre with high hopes and expectations on this cold
Tuesday in Toronto and I left delighted. <br /><br />Simply blown-away by this masterpiece. <br /><br />If you have a chance to go and see this film before the Oscars I WOULD
HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING SO. But be warned: you are going to leave
feeling invigorated with amazement!<br /><br />10/10, 5/5, however you want to rate it: this film is near perfection.<br /><br />Cheers!
