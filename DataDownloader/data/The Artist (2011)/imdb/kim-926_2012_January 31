The first 20 minutes was entertaining. The rest of the film you spend
waiting for something, anything to happen. People started chatting in
our full cinema to keep themselves entertained. There is a cute
extremely well-trained animal in the film but there is also a serious
absence of plot and just relying on 1920s style visuals with no story
to follow for most of the film does not produce an evening&#x27;s
entertainment. <br /><br />Having read the first few reviews here, I can only assume that someone
has paid a team to boost the reviews for this film. For the marketing
of this film, 10 stars, for its entertainment value 3 and that is
pushing it. IMDb will have to think of something else besides a ten
line limit to stop film ratings from being manipulated like this.
