The Artist: I hear of people who see Charlie Chaplin movies and Laurel
Hardy movies but i don&#x27;t recollect watching full movies of them , a
little glimpse here and there when i was a kid. The artist is really an
exemplary experiment. A charming dashing silent hero whose smile warms
the cockles of ones heart is slowly rendered obsolete by the talking
movies. Who knew so much can be conveyed with not ...one word being
said.The charm of silent movies where a live orchestra was played while
the film rolled and theaters had these charming glamorous round
balconies with people dressed to the nines is brought out really well.
Will the pride of the dwindling star send him to oblivion or will he
reinvent himself and change with the times with the helping hand of a
guardian angel Peppy Miller the new star of talking movies. Watch to
find out. I thought that &#x22;The Artist&#x22; was an original thought but it
seems to by super-heavily inspired from the movie &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;
a 1952 musical.It has the cheerfull-ness of the 1920&#x27;s in Gene Kelly&#x27;s
smile and easy nature and in the high pitch of the actress&#x27;s voice.
SITR also talks about the transformation of movies from silent to
talkies but in comparison unlike Jean Dujardin in Artist which is self
destructive and gloomy, the transition for the actor Gene Kelly is much
at ease probably due to his constant companion Cosmos who provides
comedy and support to Gene&#x27;s character and the actress Kathy his love
interest. In &#x22;the artist&#x22; tap dancing is shown to come to their rescue
at the end of the movie. In &#x22;singin in the rain &#x22; it is a part of the
narrative in the middle of the movie which helps them transition from
silent to talkies.It&#x27;s an enjoyable watch.
