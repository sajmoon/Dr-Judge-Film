2012_February 20 
I don&#x27;t get why people are agog over this movie. I wanted to like the
movie but it was achingly boring through the first hour that I didn&#x27;t
think I could take the last 40 minutes. It picks up a little in the
second half as it gets darker but it&#x27;s still limp. Not as good as any
ordinary silent movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. Overly campy, predictable, and
frankly boring. I thought the movie would provide modern movie
story-telling to an old art form to transform the medium. It clearly
didn&#x27;t do that and also failed as an ode to the glorious silent films
of the past. Simply making a silent film today that is weak, insipid
and vacuous does not qualify as homage. Even the independent film house
where I saw this movie, which has adoring audiences that tend to
applaud at the end of every movie, failed to generate the obligatory
applause when this tome ended. I was very disappointed.
