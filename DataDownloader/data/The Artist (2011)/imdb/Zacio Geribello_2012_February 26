The Artist searches the ultimate fountains of movies. If you take
everything else out, what is the essential? Could we take out the
sound? The dialogs? The images? No, not the images. But is that what
movies are all about? The reason to be? Not quite, at least I don&#x27;t
think so and I don&#x27;t feel this way. We could not take the images, for
sure, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the media, the supporting language of
movies. But maybe it&#x27;s not yet the essential.<br /><br />I studied language a lot at the university, it would be very boring and
inappropriate to discuss it here, but it would be very useful to
comment something about it. It&#x27;s the &#x22;old&#x22; discussion, the &#x22;rivalry&#x22;:
which says more, or means more to us? Words or images? Words and images
or silence? Images or music? If we put that way, though, it would seem
that all these languages, all these ways to express feelings, thoughts
and actions would be in an endless battle against each other, competing
against each other, but it is not true. One media, one language, helps
the other, works with the other. This is art and culture, this is
language.<br /><br />So, when we see a silent movie, it doesn&#x27;t mean it has no words or
dialogs. If we could see it, there would be an intense interchange of
words, between silent movies and audiences. Words are all over it, in
the big screen and in the atmosphere of the theater. We are all the
time trying to put words in it, to understand. There&#x27;s no way one could
understand images, even sounds, without looking for words.<br /><br />Sometimes they just aren&#x27;t in the first plan of things, but they are
there. There is just a difference in the focus, in the emphasis of what
is being told and the way it&#x27;s being told. Sometimes best communication
comes with silence. But there are words deep inside the silence and all
around it. So the essence of movies could not be just the images or
just the silence. Also, it&#x27;s not essential that you spell all the
words, sonorous ones.<br /><br />By watching The Artist in 2012 we spontaneously start thinking about
those things. The answers or maybe the new questions should come from
the story, from the movie. I actually made a list: audience,
entertainment, art, magic, dream, visual effects, comedy, drama,
adventure, mystery, there are a lot of very important roots composing
the essence of movies. They are the elements of movies that combine in
very different proportions in each project, like a DNA.<br /><br />There seems to be, however, one element among all the others, that made
movies what they are, that made movie industry and its alternatives
what they are. Of course we know it, it&#x27;s romance. Not always in the
first plan, sometimes not visible in any plan, but it&#x27;s there, like the
words, it&#x27;s the essence, what makes us understand movies. Even when
it&#x27;s denied, fought against or destroyed; it&#x27;s the energy that works
underneath. Or when there&#x27;s a silence about love and romance in a
movie, we miss it. But when it comes to the surface, we finally meet
what we were looking for, what gives meaning to a not ordinary but very
special life.<br /><br />This is what movies are all about. None of us really want an ordinary
life, we want it to be special and happy. We are not all the time
thinking about love and romance, but that&#x27;s the road where everything
else we care about is. And that is what made The Artist a great movie.
It is a wonderful story, a meaningful one, working with all these
elements, roots and, of course, the essence of movies.
