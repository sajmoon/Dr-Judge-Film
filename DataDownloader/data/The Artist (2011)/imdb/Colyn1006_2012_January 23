&#x22;The Artist&#x22; has received an abundance of praise and awards since it&#x27;s
limited release back in late November. Knowing that, I saw the film
with high expectations. Sadly, I was left empty and wanting more. <br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; follows the life of a silent film actor, George Valentin
(Jean Dujardin). George is the &#x22;it guy&#x22; in the 1920&#x27;s vision of
Hollywood; he&#x27;s good looking, charming, and has a bad-ass mustache. The
opening scene sets you right into this silent world with the premiere
of George&#x27;s new film, &#x22;A Russian Affair&#x22;. As George&#x27;s film, &#x22;A Russian
Affair&#x22; ends, George comes on stage and entertains the audience by
saying a few words and doing a little dance; The audience loves it.
Later that same evening, George is outside the theater posing for
pictures for the press when a young woman, Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
Bejo), drops her purse. As she goes to retrieve it, she gets bumped and
is pushed right into George. George laughs it off and poses for
pictures alongside the young woman. Peppy wants to be an actress; the
next day she goes to an audition at Kinograph Studios and
coincidentally has another encounter with George. Al Zimmer (John
Goodman), the Studio&#x27;s boss, isn&#x27;t to intrigued by Ms. Miller, but with
George&#x27;s help she becomes the next big thing in Hollywood. From that
point on, George&#x27;s life is in a downward spiral. As she rises, he
falls. With &#x22;Talkies&#x22; starting to become the new form of cinema, George
loses his job, his house, and his wife. Given that &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a
silent film, it&#x27;s a pretty dark and intriguing tale of a washed up
actor.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; -to put it bluntly- is a piece of art. It&#x27;s beautiful,
funny, and suspenseful without even trying too hard; It&#x27;s a true
achievement in filmmaking. Another thing that is worth mentioning is
how natural everything feels. Whether it be the acting, the music, the
black and white film alongside the four by three aspect ratio, it never
feels like an anachronism.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin, B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo and John Goodman give beautiful
performances. There is no spoken dialogue that can be heard, so you
might want to learn to read lips (only with image captions that pop-up
occasionally is when you can understand what the characters are
saying). Otherwise, you only know what&#x27;s going on by watching the
actors&#x27; facial expressions and movements. There were more than a couple
times in this film where I felt great sympathy for Jean Dujardin&#x27;s
charismatic character, George. You feel sad when George is sad and you
feel happy when he&#x27;s happy; he&#x27;s that kind of character. James Cromwell
plays Clifton, George&#x27;s faithful butler, and he&#x27;s great as well.
There&#x27;s a scene with George and Clifton, I&#x27;m not going to spoil it, but
it&#x27;s just pitiful. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo doesn&#x27;t get as much screen time as
Jean Dujardin, but believe me, she does leave her mark.<br /><br />Even though The film uses the four by three aspect ratio with no color,
the cinematography is a delight to look at. Like I said, there is no
sound, except for the score that composer Ludovic Bource provides. To
be honest, It&#x27;s not exactly my kind of music, but it replicates the era
perfectly (The same goes for the costume designs).<br /><br />I&#x27;ve done nothing but praise this film, so what&#x27;s the problem? Well...I
really don&#x27;t have one. I&#x27;m willing to admit something that no one ever
seems to want to own up to: maybe it&#x27;s just me. Maybe it was the lack
of dialogue that threw me off, maybe it was the music. Regardless, &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; deserves the praise it has gotten and will receive. Michel
Hazanavicius made a bold move for making a film of this style, and it
pays off. <br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a film I respect way more than I like. I give &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; a 3.5/5<br /><br />- Colyn Kirkland
