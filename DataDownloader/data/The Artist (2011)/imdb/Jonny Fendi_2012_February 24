Speechless... is one word to describe thiz movie. It has been proved
that you don&#x27;t need expensive Actors or famous Director to make a
terrific movie. The movie is presented like an old time silent movie,
it is black and white, almost no conversation and even was shot in the
1.33 : 1 aspect ratio. It takes place in 1927, when George Valentin
(Jean Dujardin) was the king of silent movies. An unexpected encounter
with the young and lovely rising star Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo)
takes him to the mutual delight adventure in film industry. Every Actor
plays its role perfectly, main or supporting. Jean Dujardin performs a
superb and flawless acting. His charisma is unquestionable central
element. He got the eye gaze, the eyebrow raised, the eyelash flutter,
the dancing, everything that knocks down the game entirely. His
opposite love interest, B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo creates an equal presence. Maybe
she&#x27;s not the most gorgeous blonde girl figures, but she is positively
charming in every way. Other roles which are played by John Goodman,
Penelope Ann Miller and James Cromwell as a loyal butler and even the
dog are proportionally fit as they need to be. The plot is perfectly
told. Although it is a black and white silent movie, every minute you
spend it doesn&#x27;t make you bore at all. The selection of Musical Scores
is vital. Music is the life of thiz movie. It flows up and down
dynamically during the mood changing in every scene. The man behind the
curtain is Michel Hazanavicius, the under radar and unknown Director
takes the risk to do something completely different and it seems to be
perfectly pay off. I have to say that the conflict issue is brilliant!
It is a solid winning theme. If you are an Actor or someone who has
been involved in thiz industry, you will surely appreciate the message
behind thiz movie. It is a Golden Gate that bridging the
intergenerational gap. Silence is Golden, my friend!<br /><br />Visit My Blog on JONNY&#x27;S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com
