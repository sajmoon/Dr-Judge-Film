&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is an amazing film in so many ways. In an age of color
films with lots of noise and special effects, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a silent
film in black and white with few effects. And it is brilliant, almost
certainly the best film of the year. It is entirely original, taking
advantage of modern technologies and techniques that could not have
been used when silent movies were on offer. The story is almost
entirely visual, with very few dialogue placards -- and the visuals are
stunning. But the most creative thing about the film is the use of
sound conveyed at times by orchestra, at times by ensembles and at
times by single instruments. And the most stunning thing of all is the
use of total silence at a climactic moment of the film This is like no
silent movie I&#x27;ve ever seen -- for that matter, like no other movie
I&#x27;ve ever seen. Go see it in a movie theatre, not on your television.
