I am delighted that this genial and vastly entertaining portrait of the
dying days of silent cinema has gotten such a rapturous reception...if
only because it may open people up to exploring the glory of GENUINE
silent classics. I had a stranger chat with me about how she was
stunned at how entertaining and spellbinding sitting through a mainly
silent film was...I promptly recommended that she seek out something
like &#x22;Wings&#x22;...nicely restored, freshly out on DVD, sure to be
available on NETFLIX...and still as entertaining and enthralling as
ever...I find it so sad that so many people today are frightened off by
BLACK AND WHITE...much less silence...I hope this movie helps them
realize what they are missing.<br /><br />While I was vastly entertained by this film&#x27;s superb acting and mainly
successful atmosphere...I did wish they had not played so fast and
loose with the actual history of the transition period. (In Brief this
film is depicted as opening in 1927 with sound coming in sometime 1n
1929...in reality &#x22;Don Juan&#x22; had a synchronized score in 1926...&#x22;The
Jazz Singer&#x22; was a sensation with a dialog in fall 1927, and &#x22;the
Lights of New York &#x22; was ALL TALKING in early 1928...silents were all
but totally gone by 1929...barring holdouts like Garbo who talked in
1930...and Chaplin who held out til &#x27;36)...If they played fast and
loose so they could make the hero crash when the market crashed they
could at least have gotten the dates right!!!!<br /><br />Anyway...it is otherwise a miraculously entertaining movie...(even with
the stolen cue from &#x22;Vertigo&#x22; ...which was nicely used...too bad the
film could not have been acknowledged along with Herrman&#x27;s tiny credit!<br /><br />I think what impressed me most was how cleverly the script melded
elements of &#x22;Singin&#x27; In the Rain&#x22; and &#x22;A Star is Born&#x22; together and
formed a delicious souffl&#xE9; of a portrait of golden age Hollywood...<br /><br />Encore...Encore!!
