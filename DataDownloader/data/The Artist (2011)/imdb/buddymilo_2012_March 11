The film&#x27;s blocking a B&#x26;W cinematography were very good but that was
about it... it&#x27;s amazing how a spin can be put on something and
everybody just follows along. I really think that the Weinstein Company
put the joke on us... making a mediocre silent movie in 2011 had to be
cheap... so Harvey is laughing all the way to the bank. There are
hundreds of better silent movies made years ago... what&#x27;s the buzz
here? Giving the film so many Oscars is really an insult to the other
nominated films. Just because the Weinsteins have power in Hollywood
isn&#x27;t enough for me to blindly follow the opinion that this is a
&#x22;brilliant&#x22; film... very far from it.
