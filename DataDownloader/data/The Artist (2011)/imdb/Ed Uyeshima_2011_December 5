To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the
artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a
severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would
and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he
singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance.
Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this
stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression
audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of
matin&#xE9;e idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the
silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in &#x22;Sunset Boulevard&#x22;, &#x22;We didn&#x27;t
need dialogue. We had faces then.&#x22; And indeed Hazanavicius has found
the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin
portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with
a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog)
and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen&#x27;s leading
lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his
popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he
has a &#x22;meet-cute&#x22; run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a
pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is
immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in
another &#x22;meet-cute&#x22; run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once
their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard &#x22;A
Star Is Born&#x22; storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is
on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit
that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one
would expect from previous versions of this tale. That&#x27;s how
Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows
considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts.
There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W.
Murnau&#x27;s &#x22;Sunrise&#x22; and King Vidor&#x27;s &#x22;The Crowd&#x22; and even a wink to the
classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles&#x27; &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22; to illustrate
how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.<br /><br />Some of Valentin&#x27;s most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered
like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection
against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic
nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The
movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that
subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses
himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious
character without a trace of irony. It&#x27;s a genuinely exquisite
performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in
less assured hands. What&#x27;s more, the man can really dance. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
Bejo (who also happens to be the director&#x27;s wife) is lovely and
vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as
a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character.
Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first
audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of
a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to
be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.<br /><br />The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like
John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James
Cromwell as Valentin&#x27;s dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as
Valentin&#x27;s shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina
Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same
fertile ground as &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;. By the way, that&#x27;s Uggie who
plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to
Asta from &#x22;The Thin Man&#x22; series. Kudos also need to be given to
Guillaume Schiffman&#x27;s accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other
pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett&#x27;s
production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury
Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource&#x27;s swooning music score,
which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann&#x27;s &#x22;Vertigo&#x22; score over a
climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the
critics, it&#x27;s not a film for everyone&#x27;s tastes. Silent cinema, by its
very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some
will find tedious, and even at a running time of 100 minutes, the movie
still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate
it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.
