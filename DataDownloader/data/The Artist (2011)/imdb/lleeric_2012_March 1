When i first heard about the Artist, I knew it was going to win best
picture in the Oscars and i knew this was going to be great. I was sooo
right. This movie was so interesting and boy it sure was a success!
This movie was so fun and entertaining. Although, i didn&#x27;t love it or
it isn&#x27;t one of my favorite movies of 2011 it was still very good. This
film takes place in the 1920s to the 1930s about a popular actor named
George Valentin. He only does silent films. One day, he meets a women
named Peppy Miller who is a BIG FAN of George. She is really good at
dancing and decides to dance in films in George&#x27;s Studio. Slowly and
slowly she gets popular and popular and rises to the top by doing
talkies which was the new evolution to films.George only wants to do
silent films and slowly and slowly get&#x27;s abandoned and lost and loses
popularity. People should check this movie out. The performances WERE
SOOOO amazing. and man i&#x27;m glad this won for original score because the
songs in this movie were great. I was completely engaged in to this
movie the whole time. You guys should check this out sometime. I would
give this movie a 8/10
