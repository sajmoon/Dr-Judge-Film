&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is one of those films that you go into not expecting very
much out of it, and, in the end, you&#x27;re left truly moved, and inspired.
This film is certainly unconventional, but that adds to what makes it
so GREAT! <br /><br />The year is 1927, the place, Hollywood. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin)
is one of the most successful and beloved silent movie stars, and along
with his canine companion and sidekick, Uggie, charms his ways through
Hollywood. While making his newest movie, George meets an up and coming
dancer and actress, Peppy Miller, who dreams of making it big, and the
two start an unusual friendship/partnership, which makes George&#x27;s
already jealous wife (Penelope Anne Miller) even MORE jealous, because
she believes that there is something more between the two coworkers One
day, the director of George&#x27;s newest film, and a frequent collaborator
and close friend (John Goodman) shows George something new, something
that he calls &#x22;the future&#x22;- movies with sound, or Talkies. For some
reason, George is not willing to speak in the movies, and is convinced,
as is everyone else, that he will soon become a thing of the past.<br /><br />Over the next few years, Peppy becomes one of the hottest stars in
Hollywood, while George sinks deeper and deeper into obscurity. When
his next movie, &#x22;Tears of Love&#x22; opens alongside Peppy&#x27;s newest Talkie,
and proceeds to bomb, he slumps into a deep depression that leads him
to fire his butler and closest friend, Clifton (James Cromwell), and on
two occasions, attempts to commit suicide, until Peppy comes to his
rescue, and saves not only his life, but also his career.<br /><br />What makes &#x22;The Artist&#x22; so terrific is the director and
cinematographer&#x27;s decision to shoot the film in black and white, and
make it silent, to add to the authenticity of the time period and the
subject. The added bonus of VERY FEW duologue cards allows the audience
the opportunity to create duologue between the characters. Combine that
with Ludovic Borec&#x27;s score, which ALSO fits the time period, and you
have one hell of a authentic film set in the 1920s. The chemistry
between Jean Dujardin and Bernece Bejo is ELECTRIC, and their
performances speak magnitudes even though the film is silent. This is
ONE HELL of an amazing movie, and it leaves you speechless after the
film ends.
