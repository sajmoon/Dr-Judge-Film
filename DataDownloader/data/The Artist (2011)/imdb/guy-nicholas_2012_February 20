2012_February 20 
Before the Oscars I&#x27;ve been hoping to catch up on as many of the top
nominations for this year. FINALLY, after a long time, I finally got to
view The Artist. I had heard so much about this movie, and to be
honest, I wasn&#x27;t that excited about it. I had seen a few silent black
and white films, and I thought they were exceptionally average. I had
low expectations for this, and that was a bad idea on my part.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin, in a extraordinarily executed performance, plays George
Valentin. He is basically the George Clooney of the late twenties.
George Valentin is known as one of the greatest silent movie actors of
that time. With the arrival of sound, or &#x22;talkies,&#x22; Valentin fears his
career is in jeopardy, while at the same time, finds a friend in a
young and aspiring actress named Peppy, played by Berenice Bejo. I
loved Bejo in this movie, I loved her performance. I thought it was
very believable.<br /><br />I loved this movie, and I&#x27;m trying to think of good enough adjectives
to describe it, because any word I come up with, I feel is an
understatement...of epic proportions. I was skeptical when I heard this
movie was going to be silent and black and white. My main concern was,
will I be able to follow this? Right from the get-go, you are rooting
for the characters, and you are understanding what they are going
through and what was going on. There are some moments when we see
captions that tell us what the actors are saying, though, most of the
time we don&#x27;t need them.<br /><br />There are some great actors in this movie, some great familiar faces.
John Goodman, Ken Davitian (and if you saw him in Borat, you won&#x27;t be
able to help but smile), James Cromwell, and many more. I actually
stayed through the CREDITS of the movie, and believe me when I say, I
rarely stay through the credits of a movie, unless I&#x27;m tipped off about
something at the end of the credits, like The Grey.<br /><br />I hope this movie does well at the Oscars, but I have yet to see if the
movie deserves Best Picture, for I still have more movies to watch.
HIGHLY recommend this, for it is a great experience at the movies.<br /><br />Well-deserved 10 out of 10.
