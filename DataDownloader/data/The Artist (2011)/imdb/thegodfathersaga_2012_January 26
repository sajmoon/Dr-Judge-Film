i wasn&#x27;t extremely pleased with this film. it&#x27;s a very good tribute to
silent cinema. the performances are very strong by the whole cast (the
leads were a perfect match for each other), including the dog. it&#x27;s an
original and audacious idea to make a silent, black and white film,
with the 1.33 format, in this day and age. that&#x27;s something to admire,
but i felt that the film tries too hard to be affable and charming,
presenting a pretty schmaltzy and uncreative script; the protagonist
predicament completely misses the point of gaining the viewer&#x27;s
sympathy, he rather comes off as a stubborn fool who&#x27;s not willing to
leave his comfort zone without any real reasoning (talking could&#x27;ve
probably advanced the story a lot, but oh well).. the separation
between George Valentin and his wife is also poorly justified; around
that time, the film got a little too bleak without any effect. the
jolly moments were pretty, well assisted by the music; but even those
were a little excessive, i thought. that&#x27;s probably not the film&#x27;s
fault, though, because maybe i wasn&#x27;t really in a jolly mood... i seem
to be focusing on the things i didn&#x27;t like more but still, it managed
to draw a smile on my face on quite a few occasions.<br /><br />it&#x27;s surprising how quickly the charm and cheerfulness wore off.
