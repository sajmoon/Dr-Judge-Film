Loved this movie. In a world where flashy special effects, shallow
characters, non-existent plots and unbridled sex and violence rule the
silver screen, it&#x27;s so refreshing to see a movie that goes back to
basics - literally! At first I thought the whole concept of a
modern-day movie filmed like a silent movie would be pretentious and
self-righteous, but it proved to be highly original. The characters
have a lot of heart and you really do care about them; especially
George&#x27;s dog, who - in my humble opinion - really steals the show. The
silent part doesn&#x27;t detract from the storytelling at all as I thought
it might, but with actors as good as these, you can tell exactly what
they&#x27;re conveying to each other just by the facial expressions, the
look of their eyes and the score - which is magnificent by the way, and
absolutely spot on.
