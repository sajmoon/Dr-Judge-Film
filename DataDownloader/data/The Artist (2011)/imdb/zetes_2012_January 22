A highly enjoyable little throwback to the silent film era. It&#x27;s more
or less a slightly altered version of Singin&#x27; in the Rain. Its male
star, Jean Dujardin, is even a dead ringer for Gene Kelly (and, in a
far too brief role, the wonderful character actress Missi Pyle also
makes a great stand-in for Jean Hagen). Dujardin plays the great silent
film star George Valentin, a Douglas Fairbanks type who makes
swashbucklers and spy films, is always aided by his trusty dog (played
by Uggie, but strangely never named in the film), and always wins the
girl. One day he meets up with an attractive extra, Peppy Miller
(Berenice Bejo), who meets his fancy. Unfortunately, he&#x27;s married, so
that romance has to die before it even starts. The film opens in 1927 -
a couple of years go by and Valentin is being pushed out by the advent
of sound, while Peppy is becoming a major star. The story isn&#x27;t
anything really special, honestly, and the silent filmmaking, while it
is well done, is nothing more than a gimmick. The film might not work
at all if it weren&#x27;t for Dujardin and Bejo, both of whom are just
charming as all get-out. Bejo in particular is just one of the most
gorgeous starlets ever - it was really surprising to find out she&#x27;s
been toiling away in the industry for over a decade now (she co-starred
in A Knight&#x27;s Tale, with Heath Ledger, in 2001). It takes a while to
get over Dujardin&#x27;s resemblance to Gene Kelly (I have to imagine
director Michel Hazanavicius, who made the two French spy spoofs in the
OSS 117 series with Dujardin, came up with the idea by wondering what
it would be like to remake Singin&#x27; in the Rain with the star), but I
did eventually. I was enjoying the film so much I have to admit I
didn&#x27;t even notice the use of Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s Vertigo theme.
