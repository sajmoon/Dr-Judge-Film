Dujardin was splendid in the interpretation and Oscar-worthy with
praise. Your partner B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo also gave richness to the film. I
loved every detail. A remarkable film. I found the movie so perfect
that I wrote on a site here in Brazil called infinidade.com.br a more
complete assessment. Now I was curious about the next movie that will
Dujardin. Does it have the same performance? We wait. Here in Brazil
the film has been a success. People thought that by being silent and
black and white film would be bad. Coompletamente missed. This is a
film that will go down in cinema history. A Franco-Belgian production
that made the difference. Super deserving of awards received.
