How many times do you get to see a new silent film in theaters?
exactly! If you want to see a silent film in theaters then you should
see The Artist.Its a film which takes you back to 1920&#x27;s and early
talkie films and does it perfectly.Filmed in black and white and
virtually no sound The Artist realizes on facial expression to tell the
story and to get the point across; which actor James Dujardin and
actress Berenice Bejo do well. Nominated for ten Oscars this is a film
in which everybody should see and you will love it. Full of fantastic
facial humor as well as drama if you love films then you will fall in
love and treasure this film.
