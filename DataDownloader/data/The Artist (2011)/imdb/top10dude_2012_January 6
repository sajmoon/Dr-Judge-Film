Despite the great word of mouth and good press, I&#x27;m still stunned at
how much I enjoyed this effort. I never thought in a million years that
a silent movie made in the modern era would make my best of the year
list but it did and it&#x27;s right at the top. The movie exudes charm as it
develops and then grabs the viewer with its story and symbolism. It
turns far darker then I expected and maybe runs a bit long but that
doesn&#x27;t diminish my overall fondness for this picture. Yeah, that&#x27;s
right, this is one swell picture with a cast of good eggs! The casting
director should take a bow because everyone was so perfect in their
vintage roles and mannerisms. Everything fits and everything works and
I really can&#x27;t wait to see this one again.
