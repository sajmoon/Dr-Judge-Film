&#xA0; What a pleasant surprise The Artist is. I was expecting something
pretentious but what I got was a charming and entertaining romantic
comedy. The fact that it is shot in black and white is silent (it has a
very good accompanying original orchestral score with a slice of
Bernard Hermann thrown in for good measure) and framed in a non wide
screen academy format only adds to the movie. &#xA0; The cast are
universally excellent especially the two leads Jean Dujardin and
B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Miller excelling in their roles with James Cromwell and John
Goodman &#xA0;giving &#xA0;great performances. The direction is spot on and
really does portray the style of movies form the late 20&#x27;s early 30&#x27;s
and using authentic locations really helps. &#xA0; I watched the movie in an
almost full cinema on a very large screen. The audience laughed and
gasped throughout the screening and there was a spontaneous round of
applause at the end. I would recommend seeing the movie in a cinema
with an audience to get the full impact. Highly recommended.
