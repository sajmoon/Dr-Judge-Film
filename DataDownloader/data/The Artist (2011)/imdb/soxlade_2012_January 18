George Valentin is the silent movie star. He and his dog, Jack, are the
stars of many a hit film. They are loved by their public and boy, do
they know it. But George&#x27;s life is about to be turned upside down by
the advent of a new technology - sound. George&#x27;s pride and arrogance
make him blind to the fact that the audience want to hear their stars
as well as see them, and so begins his slow slide into obscurity.<br /><br />The story to the Artist is a well worn one, and one that was a staple
of many of the melodramas of the period it recreates. It is a good
enough story, well told and well acted even if it drags a little
towards the end, but it is not where the true joy of &#x22;The Artist&#x22; lies.<br /><br />The Artist is wonderful for a huge number of reasons. Firstly the
performances from everyone involved are superb, delivering their
(silent) lines with the perfect collection of facial expressions and
body language. You may not be able to keep up with what they are
saying, but you understand what their characters are feeling. Those of
you who may be worried about enjoying a silent film, don&#x27;t be. The film
draws you in and involves you with the characters and their story. You
don&#x27;t miss a thing.<br /><br />Though the entire cast are spectacular, especially Jean Dejardin and
Berenice Bejo as George and Pepe, I felt a special love for Penelope
Ann Miller as George&#x27;s wife Doris, James Cromwell as Clifton, and a
fantastically curmudgeonly Malcolm McDowell as an unimpressed extra.
Auggie the Dog though, as George&#x27;s most loyal friend, is spectacular.
He delivers a genuine performance as opposed to just seeming to be a
collection of cute tricks. What could have been cutesy or mawkish comes
across as genuinely believable.<br /><br />On the technical front the film is unusual and innovative. The film
makers commit to a historically accurate 4:3 ratio image, to title
cards and simple graphics to highlight their story, but this also
allows them to play around with the conventions. The locked off, fixed
cameras of the silent era is often mixed in with more modern dolly
shots; there are hints of colourisation, occasional graphic touches
appear that were beyond film makers of the late 1920s. All these little
touches highlight a point, emphasise a character or underline an
emotion. <br /><br />All of this technical detail is enhanced by the wonderful score which
swells, drops, meanders, dances, mopes and soars along with the
audience&#x27;s emotions. Because of the lack of dialogue and sound effects,
&#x22;The Artist&#x22; highlights the power of music and moving pictures to
deliver emotion to the audience.<br /><br />The re-creation of early Hollywood and Burbank is detailed but not
glorious. Unlike beautiful re-creations such as LA Confidential
however, the Hollywood of &#x22;The Artist&#x22; feels a busy, lively and warm
place. There is a sense of community throughout the film: people may
forget who you were, but they don&#x27;t forget that you are a person.<br /><br />This is key to the film&#x27;s charm. It isn&#x27;t mean-spirited. It reminded me
of &#x22;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&#x22;, a film that never fails to make you smile.<br /><br />But most importantly of all, it reminds you of the power of moving
pictures. One wonderful sequence is a long static shot of two floors
and an interconnecting staircase on which our leads stand, conversing.
Around them, above them, below them, past them, rush busy people. All
this movement all around the frame just serves to underline the
immobility of our romantic leads - so involved are they in each other,
the world is literally passing them by. It is wonderfully romantic,
warm and delicate scene, but achieved without the use of sound, speech
or even our leads in focus. <br /><br />It isn&#x27;t perfect, some on-screen prompts come across as clumsy and the
shallow plot sags just a bit in the final third, but the charm and wit
of the piece easily surmounts this minor quibbles. It is hard not to
dislike a film that delivers its fair quotient of zingers via the
medium of text.<br /><br />The film is warm, romantic, witty, smart and utterly charming. It
deserves to win many an award.
