I&#x27;m getting tired of reviewing other peoples&#x27; work, when I want to be
shooting my own stuff, but this film really was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />Who says they don&#x27;t make black and white silent films anymore? Before
the days of talkies, musicals (much less sci-fi blockbusters and CGI
fests) there were the likes of Rudolph Valentino, Mary Pickford,
Charlie Chaplain and a host of others who are now immortalized in
American (and now global) cinematic culture.<br /><br />Old fashioned film making with modern film making techniques, and a few
rifts on an old formula with a contemporary twist. Me, I really didn&#x27;t
get the whole romance thing, but that&#x27;s just me. It seemed a bit over
the top. But, the film is what it is.<br /><br />Give it a shot. It&#x27;s worth a view, though I might only recommend it to
die hard film aficionados.<br /><br />Enjoy.
