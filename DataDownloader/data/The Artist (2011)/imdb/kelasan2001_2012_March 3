Korean girlfriend insisted on seeing this, so I caved. Thought I was in
for a yawner, Cannes film festival, put your feet to sleep, &#x22;let me out
of here!&#x22;...etc.<br /><br />Now, in all honesty, the first 15 minutes may have you looking for the
exits as this experience is...well...unique, and initially boring (for
anyone will all their teeth). Anyway, as the picture progresses you&#x27;ll
find yourself more attentive and involved, probably more than you&#x27;ve
ever been before, because this movie demands your &#x22;active&#x22; as opposed
to &#x22;passive&#x22; attention. No great special effects or digital wizardry to
mindlessly delight the senses, just great facial expressions, body
language and stage presence to convey emotion and meaning (with the odd
dialogue box thrown in when necessary). <br /><br />In my case, by the time we got to movie&#x27;s end the only word that came
to mind was riveting. The Korean audience were literally awe struck by
the picture, judging by the looks on their faces as they stayed in
their seats and actually sat through the credits (usually it&#x27;s a mad
dash for the exits as soon as the lights come up). I felt the same way.
I have seen some black and white comedy (Charlie Chaplin) on the
nostalgia channel, along with some snippets from other silent films,
but I&#x27;ve never sat through an entire production like this and really
gotten into the story.<br /><br />For you guys with gals, this is a great way to score brownie points
with your girl (going to an apparent &#x22;chic flick&#x22;). Thus justify
dragging her to an action movie in the future. Best part is you&#x27;ll
really enjoy it, too (just don&#x27;t tell her...stupid):)
