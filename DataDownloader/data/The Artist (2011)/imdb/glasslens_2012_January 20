2012_January 20 
We sit watching the adverts and the trailers for the latest awful
Hollywood rubbish - the ghastly War Horse and the UK&#x27;s over-hyped Iron
Lady (great impressionist is Ms Streep but that&#x27;s it). Then, the
curtains pull in - that&#x27;s unusual - we go to 4x3. We go from Glorious
colour (on the very day Kodak go into liquidation - I really cannot
believe this). And, we small group of film lovers in a club for film
lovers - The wonderful Harbour Lights in Southampton - become silent.
And, for the next hour and forty minutes we do not watch so much as
live in a world of no- colour and no dialogue. Left therefor to
concentrate on the visuals and occasional subtitles. We enjoyed the
endless subtleties and not so subtleties, the actors expressions and
movements. We titter and some sob. And, some of us wondered why we
needed colour (let alone 3D) or the constant noise and distraction of
dialogue. So, why almost a masterpiece? Well, it was a little
self-indulgent and there were some over-laboured scenes (presumably to
help of US cousins to understand it). The conversation in the bar
afterwards was so so positive - a rare thing. Tonight, I watched Ken
Russel&#x27;s Elgar - also B/W though some BBC fool had stretched it to 16x9
- though it was well graded. It was 43 years old and it was beautiful
if clumsily operated. It too reminded me of Kodak and the end of an
era.
