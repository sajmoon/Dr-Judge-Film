This film was delightful and charming in many ways. It made me feel
good. The dog was cute --- extremely cute. Bejo was a revelation, a
woman whose charm and style transcends mere fashion in any era.<br /><br />But --- Best Picture? You have to be kidding. Where was the story? You
could sum it up in 5 lines. Where was the depth of characterization?
There was virtually none. What motivated the characters? Why were they
so shallow? What reflection was there of the incredibly complex world
events that characterized that era?<br /><br />Granted --- the field was extremely weak this year. When Clooney&#x27;s
well- crafted but ultimately tepid &#x22;The Descendants&#x22; is getting
raves---well, you know it&#x27;s a thin field.<br /><br />This lightweight little French pastry belongs firmly in the middle of
the &#x22;three star&#x22; category, and deserves nothing more. (Although the dog
certainly deserves Oscar consideration.)<br /><br />Every year now, it seems, the Academy gets a &#x22;grand idea&#x22; in its head,
and then votes accordingly.<br /><br />A few years ago, the grand idea was to have a Female Director win, and
the result was an Best Picture award for the searingly dramatic but
unrealistic and deeply flawed &#x22;Hurt Locker.&#x22;<br /><br />Last year, it was &#x22;The Charm of the Royalty,&#x22; as the workmanlike &#x22;The
King&#x27;s Speech&#x22; won out over movies like &#x22;Winter&#x27;s Bone&#x22;, a film that
was utterly riveting from the first frame to the last, and directed and
acted with absolute brilliance.<br /><br />And this year, it was &#x22;Ode to Hollywood&#x22; time, evidently. <br /><br />Perhaps the most telling point about this film is that the guy writing
the film&#x27;s score (I won&#x27;t dignify his efforts by listing his name) ran
out of ideas at the film&#x27;s most critical juncture --- its dramatic
conclusion. So what did he do? He lifted Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s brilliant
music from Vertigo! A fine choice, indeed. But it put into stark
contrast the distinction between the genius of Hitchcock and Herrmann,
and the rather modest contributions of this film. Half the people
writing rave reviews here probably have no idea where that music came
from.<br /><br />Consider &#x22;Psycho&#x22; and &#x22;Vertigo&#x22;. Each film is a completely brilliant,
completely original classic that broke new cinematic ground in its
time. Yet neither won &#x22;Best Picture&#x22;. Many knowledgeable film buffs now
rate them among the ten best films ever made.
