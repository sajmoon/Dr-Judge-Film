Jean Dujardin, man, take a bow, for you were out of this world!! (He
now joins the list of my all time favorite actors)<br /><br />The moment you know that it&#x27;s a black and white silent movie, you have
this notion in your head, a notion you cannot describe. But having
enjoyed the all time Indian silent classic Pushpak years ago, I kinda
was motivated to watch this film (even before it won the Oscars). I am
glad I did.<br /><br />The Artist is a movie which you can connect with. It&#x27;s very predictable
at times, but brilliant, moving yet humorous performances by Jean
Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and every other cast member, not to forget the
dog, Uggy, make you fall in love with them. Every character is so well
written that you can emotionally connect with them. The cinematography,
though in black and white is absolutely mind-blowing, and the direction
perfect. The background musical score adds so much life to the film.
The screenplay was good, though, pardon my ignorance if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s
supposed to be in b&#x26;w classics, was kinda slow at times.<br /><br />Overall, a fabulous film, one of the best I&#x27;ve seen so far. If you
wanna have a delightful experience, go watch The Artist, with pleasure!<br /><br />For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)
