&#x22;...Black and White films suck, they&#x27;re boring.&#x22;<br /><br />Yes, sadly. These were the words of a now ex-human being, It&#x27;s sad
really that any film that is &#x27;Black and White&#x27;, to be tossed to the
side or branded as &#x22;Boring&#x22;, During the screening of &#x27;The Artist&#x27; in my
local cinema, I was bombarded with questions from friends as to why I
would watch such a film, I didn&#x27;t really respond or pay any attention
to their arrogant remarks or annoying cackles. Instead, I went to the
screening, with a healthy dose of optimism.<br /><br />Afterwards, I waltzed out of the cinema, with an expression of
satisfaction and smugness, in the knowledge that some brain-dead
individuals are missing out on a masterpiece. &#x27;The Artist&#x27; truly is a
fantastic movie. Brilliant acting paired with an unique idea really
created this film. Its incorporation of many different styles of
cinematography and of course, its classy, vintage theme was a certain
breath of fresh air for me. This remarkable spectacle of a movie will
remain a favourite, it is certainly a favourite in the eyes of many as
well. I recommend it to all, I stress to you to watch it in the cinema
first, instead of DVD; it will lose a good portion of its charm on the
small screen.<br /><br />I&#x27;m going to give it a 9/10. My only complaint is, after watching the
movie, the sudden, heart-breaking realisation that we no longer dress
like &#x27;George Valentin&#x27; struck me.
