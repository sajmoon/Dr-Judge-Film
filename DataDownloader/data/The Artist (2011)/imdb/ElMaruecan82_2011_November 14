&#xAB;We didn&#x27;t need dialogs, we had faces&#xBB; said the narcissistic Norma
Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder&#x27; &#x22;Sunset Boulevard&#x22;, referring
to the Silent Era, when she used to be big &#x85; before the &#x27;pictures got
small&#x27;.<br /><br />The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel
Hazanavicius&#x27; critically acclaimed: &#x22;The Artist&#x22;, I strongly felt this
was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond&#x27;s iconic eulogy. From
beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the
communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging
silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy
Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen
with such an electrifying magnetism that they don&#x27;t just steal the
scenes, they steal the dialogs &#x85; literally.<br /><br />I was awestruck by Dujardin&#x27;s performance. To those who didn&#x27;t grew up
with French TV programs, he&#x27;s one of the most popular and talented
comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de
Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to &#x27;diss people&#x27;, but it was
so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult
comic-troop (who made sketches &#xE0; la SNL) but even back then, he had a
little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in
both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no
doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of
Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was
promised to a brilliant career.<br /><br />Look closely at Jean Dujardin&#x27;s face, it&#x27;s like drawn with &#x27;classic&#x27;
features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like
charisma like the strength from Samson&#x27;s hair, the dazzling smile
making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho
toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin&#x27;s face is a gift
from cinematic Gods, and &#x22;The Artist&#x22; finally lets it glide, earning
him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he
deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn&#x27;t play an actor
from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of
demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more
light-hearted side.<br /><br />Valentin&#x27;s self-absorption echoes Desmond&#x27;s cynical ego while his gaudy
&#x27;Don Lockwood&#x27; mask (Gene Kelly in &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;) hides the
more poignant face of his insecurity. He&#x27;s the star of the screen
because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While
Lockwood had to adapt to the &#x27;talking&#x27; revolution, George Valentin
makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into
madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated
by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges
many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort
when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it
worked on a dramatic level.<br /><br />And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to
discomfort some viewers: it isn&#x27;t a tribute in the literary meaning of
the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds
or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story:
the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the
references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical
gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint
those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook&#x27;s &#x22;Silent
Movie&#x22;, which was clearly a tribute. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; IS a silent movie,
featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her
break with an idea from George, something that would make her different
from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever
credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom
until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br /><br />If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves
some accolades because she succeeded in looking so &#x22;old&#x22; from our POV
yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and
optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face
and youngish smile, she&#x27;s like a cute little girl enjoying what she
does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film&#x27;s most inspirational
element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this
indirectly highlights George&#x27;s source of troubles: being deprived from
what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into
oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy&#x27;s
romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider
how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br /><br />Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and
at that moment, I can&#x27;t continue without mentioning the third character
of the film, George&#x27;s dog. The relationship between George and the dog
provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness
and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will
think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not
having reduced &#x22;The Artist&#x22; to a flashy spectacle with no substance,
with the word &#x27;homage&#x27; as the director&#x27;s convenient alibi, and make a
touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time
in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the
old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the
exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis &#x85; And I&#x27;m glad he found the
true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end &#x85; didn&#x27;t
I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; plays like a missing link between &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;
and &#x22;Sunset Boulevard&#x22; and it&#x27;s indeed one of the best films of 2011,
with the absence of words as an endearing &#x27;beauty spot&#x27;.
