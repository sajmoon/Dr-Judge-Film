Like all the previous positive reviews, mine is exactly the same.
Keeping it short and sweet, this film is pure genius and conveys the
magic of cinema that so rarely comes across on the screen today. This
truly deserves to make the transition from art-house cinema to every
multiplex around the world for its ingenuity, nostalgia, comedy,
romance, drama, a wonderful score and the huge feel-good factor (i.e.
the dog steals the show and could become one of those famous iconic
dogs of cinema, up there with Lassie, Lady, Tramp and the Dalmatians!).
There are so many magical and memorable moments from this film and you
must see it for yourself to enjoy the full treat. It is certain to be
nominated in the top Oscar categories and I hope it wins Best Picture.
Could be the film of the century, which is funny, as it is set in the
cinema of a century ago!
