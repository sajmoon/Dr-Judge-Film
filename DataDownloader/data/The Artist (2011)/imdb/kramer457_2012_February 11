At first I was hesitant about seeing this movie, who wants to see a
silent movie? But it was a wonderful movie that showed the silent film
era and brought it into our present time with talking movies. The
facial expressions and the movements of the actors told an entire story
without many words. <br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone young or old. For the very young
it is a time in history that they will never be able to live and for
the older person it brings back found memories of a bygone era . The
actors were wonderful and they all played their parts very well. The
scenes were also done well. There was laughter and you could also feel
the sadness in the theater. The little dog was a talented little actor
and was a joy to watch.
