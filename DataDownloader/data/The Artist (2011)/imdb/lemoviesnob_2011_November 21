If you&#x27;ve heard anything about this movie, which won a Palme D&#x27;Or at
this year&#x27;s Cannes film festival for Best Actor, it&#x27;s probably the fact
that it&#x27;s silent. As in no dialogue. As in WTF? This may explain why
its screening on a Sunday morning in Cannes failed to fill the house.
Apart from Mel Brooks&#x27; gimmicky &#x22;Silent Movie&#x22; in 1976 , isn&#x27;t there a
good reason we haven&#x27;t had a silent feature film in almost 100 years?
We don&#x27;t generally revert back to obsolete technology; no one longs for
the good old days of 8 track tapes, right?<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about going to see a silent
movie. Had it not been for the facts that it starred Jean Dujardin, was
the opening night film for the festival, and being a French movie, I
would not have rushed to see it. It&#x27;s a good thing there were greater
forces at work because this movie is wonderful! And I urge you to see
it opening weekend, in a large, full theater. This movie is best seen
collectively; it&#x27;s the closest we may ever come to experiencing what it
may have been like to see a movie when movies were new.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin plays silent film star George Valentin (the name perhaps
a wink to silent screen star Rudolph Valentino?). Dujardin&#x27;s theatrical
experience gives him the chops to carry this film without uttering more
than one word. He brings the same David Niven-like sophistication he
brought to the OSS films he also did with director Michel Hazanavicius
without the boorish-oaf element. (I loved those movies and highly
recommend them: &#x22;OSS: Cairo, Nest of Spies,&#x22; 2007 and &#x22;OSS: Lost in
Rio,&#x22; 2009.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, his performance is weakened because it is difficult to
read his lips; this contrast becomes apparent when John Goodman appears
on screen. We don&#x27;t need to wait to read the dialogue card to know what
his character is saying. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, (another English-is-not-their-
first-language actor) who plays Valentin&#x27;s prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;e, Peppy Miller, has
the same liability to a lesser degree. However, this issue will not,
should not be cause for interference. (I just wanted to give you a
heads-up.)<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to go into much detail about the plot; the preview I&#x27;ve
linked to hints that it concerns a silent screen star&#x27;s issue with the
transition to &#x22;talkies.&#x22; Let me just encourage you to take note of one
of the most beautiful shots I&#x27;ve seen in a movie all year: George is
standing on a stair landing at the Kinograph studios; the frame
encompasses three stories, he is the only still being in a hive of
activity. In a film in which the story is told by everything but words,
it is a sublime moment.<br /><br />1920s Hollywood is recreated with &#x22;Mad Men&#x22;-like attention to detail
minus the wink to the present day. It&#x27;s great to see a little less of
John Goodman so we can enjoy his performance rather than worry about
his health. Other than my previous criticism, there is not a false
note, nor wasted moment in this entire movie.<br /><br />Finally, this movie begs for the creation of a new category at the
Academy Awards: Best Performance by a non-CGI-created animal: Uggie the
dog would be a shoo-in.
