Hollywood, 1927: Silent movie star George Valentin is famous and wanted
by his fans. He meets Peppy Miller, a young dancer, and propels her to
the top of the movie industry. But as the sound enters the Hollywood,
will George Valentin stand up to the challenge or surrender? I will
definitely remember the year 2011 as the year of extreme nostalgia
about the old movies. It seems to me that suddenly that feeling
overwhelmed all the major producers, and as the result we saw so many
films heralding how good the times were. The suit was started with
Drive, the movie that initiates a time travel into 1980s movie
production with all the main attributes in place: pounding soundtrack,
violence and L.A. Then there was Hugo, in which Martin Scorsese took us
back to the very beginning of the film production and has shown the
fate of one of the pioneers of the industry, Georges M&#xE9;li&#xE8;s. This time,
the nostalgic authors take us to 1927, the era of silent
black-and-white movies and booming movie industry.<br /><br />The Artist is very different from the other two films mentioned. If the
Drive hails the style of 80s and Hugo is the ode to the brave pioneers
of the movie industry, the Artist talks mainly about the people
involved. It asserts strongly that the actors during the 1920s were
shining, glossy, glamorous in their own, down-to-earth style, and
builds the entire storyline around it, not trying to capture the
viewers&#x27; attention by anything else.<br /><br />This was a very risky experiment. The movie is black-and-white and
silent in the era of 3D, Avatar and Transformers. But the authors&#x27; bet
on the charismatic characters paid off &#x96; the movie is very lively and
charismatic. The simple story about George Valentin who tries to find
his place in the rapidly changing world is very touching; the simple
jokes easily make you smile. The fact that the movie concentrates on
the new technology allowed some amazing plot turns &#x96; I promise that the
George&#x27;s nightmare will catch you by surprise. The movie is charming
and light in a way that only old movies can be, without being too
worried about special effects or the drama in the plot. The authors
concentrated on one thing only: that is, to make people empathise with
the main characters again, and they succeed &#x96; the main characters are
charismatic and lovable.<br /><br />Of course, this would not have happened without the right cast, and it
is difficult to underestimate the work of Jean Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
Bejo. It feels as if they came straight from late 20s, they look so
natural and confident. It is difficult not to smile when seeing Ms.
Bejo&#x27;s smile or watching Mr. Dujardin&#x27;s dances. They performed to their
best, and it is this brilliant performance that guaranteed the charisma
and irresistible charm of the movie. Absolutely gorgeous actors
literally filling the room with optimistic and upbeat mood, despite all
the hardship &#x96; they make this film what it is.<br /><br />VERDICT: The risky experiment in the era of 3D and IMAX, but the most
charming film of the year. TO WATCH: if you don&#x27;t want to miss the most
festive movie of the year.<br /><br />http://m-picturegoer.blogspot.com/
