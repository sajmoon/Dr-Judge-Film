Call me a new age critic, but I must have seen only a dozen black and
white movies, half of which was re-mastered during the Technicolor era.
Having said that, this movie has shot up to the top of my list &#x96;
Perfect and flawless, yet deep and heart wrenching. What a fantastic
and moving experience! This is not just a throwback to the early days
of cinema; this movie embodies the heart and soul of cinema as we know
it. For a B&#x26;W movie, ironically, it is very vivid in its message that
no matter who or what we have become, we should never forget our roots.<br /><br />Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, this is the motion picture
event of 2011 and for a variety of reasons. Hazanavicius&#x27; story is
simple yet profound with several underlying messages. Set during the
late &#x27;20s era of black and white films, it tells of the diminishing
favor of silent movies as the film industry gives into the increasingly
popular &#x27;talkies&#x27;. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin plays a famous but
ageing silent movie star when he literally bumps into Peppy Miller
(B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo). Although they form an instant bond, Peppy is overly
charismatic and grabs the attention of studio executives with ease.
Simultaneously, and with the advent of sound in films, Peppy is all the
rage, while George maintains that talkies are just a fad. The
inevitable happens when producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) heralds in
the new era of cinema, where Peppy becomes a major Hollywood star,
sending George into a tragic downward spiral.<br /><br />If a picture can speak a thousand words, ladies and gents, this movie
is that picture. For a silent black and white film, there is so much
conveyed, all through astounding facial expressions made possible by
brilliant performances. French actors Dujardin and Bejo are simply
flawless without uttering a single word. More than just reincarnating
screen legends like Charlie Chaplin, Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly or Gloria
Swanson, together, Dujardin and Bejo has resurrected a period in
history that faded in oblivion almost a century ago. Also worth
mentioning are great supporting roles from James Cromwell as George&#x27;s
loyal chauffeur, Goodman as the studio boss and Penelope Ann Miller as
George&#x27;s uncompromising wife, with special mention to Uggie the dog &#x96;
playing a vital and heart wrenching role.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, standing up and clapping is the least anyone
can do in appreciating Hazazavicius&#x27; brilliantly crafted work. Without
having to mention the staggering number of times this film has been
acknowledged at various film festivals and award institutions, I can
say that the performances, the story and the music are THE defining
factors of this movie. Speaking of which, the original score by Ludovic
Bource clearly sets the tone and hugely amplifies the already
overwhelming emotions, throughout.<br /><br />With the Academy Awards just round the corner, I personally feel that
&#x22;The Artist&#x22;, &#x22;Hugo&#x22;, and &#x22;The Help&#x22; are each worthy of being nominated
for the &#x22;best Picture&#x22;. A common thread between the first two is the
obvious homage to the early days of cinema and an uncanny &#x27;French
connection&#x27; that binds them together. Even so, Hazazavicius may have
turned the tables on Scorsese with this simple yet beautiful movie
within a movie. Pun unintended. In narrowing that down to just one
choice, my heart goes out to &#x22;The Artist&#x22;. Sure, the likes of Brad
Pitt, George Clooney and even Spielberg and Scorsese are often
considered Hollywood&#x27;s favorite sons, but having said that, Michel
Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin have more than reiterated the
quintessential soul of cinema &#x96; its integrity, its origins, its essence
and why it remains society&#x27;s most powerful form of art.<br /><br />Watch it only because this is a masterpiece.
