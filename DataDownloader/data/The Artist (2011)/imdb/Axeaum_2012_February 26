I do not have any words for this movie!! yes it&#x27;s silent movie. I do
not think anyone can write anything, you watch and i bet you will come
here and write something about this movie. Never ever seen such a
movie, performance of Jean as well as B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice will make you
speechless.The other best thing in the movie, its music has so much
emotion which will take you the depth of the picture. Story of the
movie is just a another romantic movie but the way it has been
pictured, its really awesome. The film is warm, romantic, witty, smart
and utterly charming. It deserves to win many an award. This movie will
be one of my best collection movies. Must watch movie. Njoy.
