First of all, from 2008, the movies which won best picture shifted
directions: instead of going towards the masterpiece original movie
they are going towards the commercial type. I hope this is the climax
of these 4 years, although I have serious doubts.<br /><br />The critiques say The Artist is just a mix of clich&#xE9;s, a compilation of
scenes from other films. How does that affect me, why would I care(asks
the casual viewer) ? Well, the answer&#x27;s simple : this film lacks depth.
Badly. I mean it&#x27;s fun to watch, it&#x27;s well made...but it just doesn&#x27;t
have like other layers of meaning hidden below the surface, imagine an
egg which is empty inside. I don&#x27;t think in those times films were like
that!<br /><br />The story is fine for entertainment, but doesn&#x27;t even come close to,
say, The Aviator. I did like the moment when the music stops and we can
hear some sounds which are briefly related to the story, it makes you
more intuitive. The acting is indeed good- and the movie is good, but
overall it just doesn&#x27;t bring anything new. It just stinks of
Hollywood, and not the old one !<br /><br />I could tell you 100 films like this one, but could hardly name 3 like,
for example, The Tree of Life.
