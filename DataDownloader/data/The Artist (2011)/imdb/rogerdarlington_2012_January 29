This is an audaciously original movie that succeeds spectacularly but
it is hard to see how such success could ever be replicated. In the age
of American widescreen blockbusters with glorious colour, crashing
sound. sharp dialogue, and computer- generated special effects, who
would have expected the creation of, let alone the acclaim for, a
Franco-Belgian 1.33:1 aspect ratio, black and white work with
(virtually) no sound and only old-fashioned visual effects?<br /><br />Above all, this is a triumph for writer and director Michel
Hazanavicius. Much of Hazanavicius&#x27; television and film work is a
pastiche of earlier cinema and &#x22;The Artist&#x22;is a homage to a past era.
It is set in Hollywood at the time that silent movies were being being
surpassed by the talkies, a transition that ruins the previously-feted
eponymous, handsome George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) but plays to the
strengths of the winsome newcomer Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, the
director&#x27;s wife). In France, Dujardin is something of a national
treasure but, until now, he has been largely unknown outside his Gallic
homeland. The two French leading roles are supplemented by those of two
familiar American actors, James Cromwell as chauffeur to Valentin and
then Miller and John Goodman as director of both. But the fifth star of
this most unusual work is a talented canine who gives us the biggest
laughs: a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie.<br /><br />Those who know their cinematic history will delight in the many
cultural references, perhaps above all to John Gilbert who failed to
make the transfer from silents to talkies. Those who have longed for a
movie with a plot that one can understand, despaired at trying to catch
snatched lines of dialogue, and feared that too much contemporary
cinema is callous and cynical will thrill to a simple and humanist work
which has its share of pathos but leaves you with a huge smile on your
face.
