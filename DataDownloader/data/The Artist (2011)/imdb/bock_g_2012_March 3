2012_March 3 
Let me make this one bold statement: &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is not a classic.
However, it is probably the most entertaining and nostalgic flick I&#x27;ve
watched in a long time (I watched this on a 12 hr. flight btw). I
haven&#x27;t watched many silent films, but I could definitely tell it pays
tribute to them. The premise is simple: a silent film actor who
struggles through the transition to &#x22;talkies&#x22; in the Depression-era
Hollywood (aka Golden Age of Hollywood). He meets a beautiful young
woman (whom he kisses in front of the press)who instantly becomes a
star and rode on the new wave of &#x22;talkies&#x22;. The contrast between the
two characters are nothing fancy, but certainly kept me interested.
There was the usual slapstick humor, but it wasn&#x27;t so obligatory and
had kept me quite entertained. The film was shot in color, but was then
converted in black and white. The cinematography was fairly good, and
certainly emulated some of the old affects pretty well. It&#x27;s a great
reflection of how Hollywood used to make films back in it&#x27;s &#x22;Golden
Age&#x22; and is a relaxing film that puts you right into your seat.
