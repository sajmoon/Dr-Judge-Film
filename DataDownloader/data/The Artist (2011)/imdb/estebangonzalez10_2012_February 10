&#xA8;Look at what you&#x27;ve become. You&#x27;ve become proud! You&#x27;ve become stupid!
&#xA8;<br /><br />The Artist is a beautiful film that pays homage to movies from the late
20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s, the silent film era. In order to do so, French
director Michel Hazanavicius decided to make this film almost entirely
without sound and in black and white. Many producers would&#x27;ve probably
thought he was crazy for trying to make a film like this in these days
where viewers are used to seeing spectacular and colorful movies with
great sound and even in 3D. However, The Artist works perfectly and is
one of the brightest films of the year despite being in black and
white. The cinematography is spectacular (perhaps only rivaled this
year by The Tree of Life and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), the costume
design and editing are among the best of the year, and the score is
also amazing. This is truly a beautiful film that many film historians
will enjoy for the nice tribute it renders to the age of silent films.
Many famous actors during this era weren&#x27;t able to make the transition
to the talkies, and that is exactly what The Artist is about, and it
does it in a very simplistic but stylized fashion. The film has been
nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Performance by a
Lead Actor (Jean Dujardin) and a Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo). It
will probably walk away with the Best Picture title considering how
appealing the subject matter is to the Academy, and how well the film
was crafted. Please don&#x27;t be scared off because the movie is silent or
in black and white because the story is really entertaining and despite
being colorless it is brighter than any other film released this year.
It is really worth a watch; you won&#x27;t regret it.<br /><br />The year is 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the height
of his artistic career. He is a very successful Hollywood actor and
producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) is very pleased with his work. After
having succeeded together yet again in a recent film, they are already
collaborating for their next project. During rehearsals for their next
movie, George runs into an extra named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo).
They hit it off instantly sharing a dance number and George insists
that Peppy should get the part. Pepper falls in love immediately with
George, but he is married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) so their
relationship is entirely professional. George gives Peppy the best
advice she would ever receive: In order to make it in the industry she
needs to be different and he paints a spot near her lip. This will be
her trademark later on as she slowly begins rising to the spotlight
during the arrival of the talkies. Valentin however, isn&#x27;t lucky and
realizes his days as a successful actor are coming to an end with the
advent of these talking pictures. People want to see new faces and hear
their voices. Al Zimmer realizes this and breaks relations with George,
so Valentin decides to produce, direct, and star in his own silent
film. The movie is a failure as people want to see these new talkies,
and as Valentin&#x27;s fame becomes to decline, Peppy Miller begins to grow
into a superstar. Valentin is left with nothing except his faithful
driver, Clifton (James Cromwell) and his Jack Russell Terrier named
Jack. The times have changed for the great artists and fortunes are
reversed.<br /><br />The Artist is among my top ten favorite films of the year and it works
really well, not only as homage to these silent films, but as a love
story as well. Along with Midnight in Paris, these are perhaps the two
best romantic movies of the year and would make for an excellent date.
I&#x27;ve already mentioned some of the technical aspects, but now I would
like to praise the performances from Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, and
the dog (which was played in most part by Uggie). I can&#x27;t leave out the
dog, because he plays an important role in this film, and in a way is
Valentin&#x27;s faithful companion and savior. Jean Dujardin does deserve
the Oscar nomination for his performance, he was terrific, and I think
I enjoyed it over George Clooney&#x27;s. If he wins, it will be well
deserved. My favorite performance of the film however, comes from
Berenice Bejo, who was also nominated as a supporting actress. She is
just terrific and shines every time she&#x27;s on screen. Her performance
gives this black and white movie a lot of color. Both Bejo and Dujardin
have worked together with director Hazanavicius in the past in the
French spy spoof film OSS 117. I&#x27;ve never seen the movie, nor its
sequel, but after seeing The Artist I&#x27;m very much interested in doing
so. Overall this is a terrific film and one you won&#x27;t want to miss.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com
