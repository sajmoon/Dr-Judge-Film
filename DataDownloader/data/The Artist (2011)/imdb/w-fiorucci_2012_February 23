This is one of the most pretentious films I have ever seen. It is
imbued with pointless clich&#xE9;s (the loyal servant, the love at a
distance, the failed artist who burns his works, the dog coming to the
rescue...not to talk about the tiring and old storyline of pride
leading to downfall before final resolution). The two levels, narrative
and meta-narrative, are utterly and inexplicably overlapped, mingled
without making a point. The choice of making a silent film which speaks
of ...silent films and of an actor who would not switch to the new
techniques of sound is a very cheap option for a film which aims at
winning an Oscar. What is the conveyed message? That silent films are
still enjoyable? Or what...? I simply do not see any greatness in this
film, only much pretentiousness.
