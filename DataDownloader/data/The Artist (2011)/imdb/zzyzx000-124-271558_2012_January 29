I&#x27;ll make this quick because I only watched the 1st half of the movie.<br /><br />If I wanted to watch a silent film that mimics the silent films of the
1920&#x27;s, I&#x27;d rent one of the originals. You can&#x27;t reinvent the wheel.<br /><br />This movie could have been titled, &#x22;Facial Expressions and Body
Language 101.&#x22; Plus the actors overact to try to make up for no sound.
Actors tend to overact anyways, but this format makes it worse.<br /><br />The story wasn&#x27;t the least bit original either. Boring.<br /><br />No I&#x27;m not in a bad mood. I just think someone bought an Academy Award
nomination.<br /><br />What a waste of my time.
