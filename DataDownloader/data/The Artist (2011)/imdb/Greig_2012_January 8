The Artist is not trying to be an authentic silent film, but instead
wishes to present a novel but respectful nod to the silent era of
Classical Hollywood. It is full of references and reads like
Hazanavicius&#x27; love letter to an era of filmmaking which he &#x96; and we &#x96;
are indebted to. In a time when films like Avatar are attempting to
revolutionise cinema by making IMAX 3D the next coming of sound, I&#x27;m
surprised The Artist was even made. But I&#x27;m glad it was. To me it
serves as a much-needed look back at the essential beginnings of the
art form. Already receiving considerable popular success, The Artist
could herald the beginning of an era when mainstream filmmakers and
audiences alike become more aware and influenced by the origins of
cinema. Apart from all that, The Artist also stands alone as an
altogether sad, funny, compelling and entertaining film.<br /><br />http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/
