There are so many wonderful aspects of this film, not sure where to
start! First, I can say this film is an instant classic. There is no
doubt about that as a fact. The production values are spot on, it feels
like you are immersed in the world of the 20&#x27;s. <br /><br />The Cast performed in what might seem simple, performing their role
without speaking. Au contraire, their faces, body language and nuances
speak volumes. The other big supporting character in the movie is the
Music. The Music brings so much emotion and depth to this great
picture. <br /><br />Some reviews here say the story is overrated. I am not sure they saw
the same pic I saw. The story is wonderfully played out from beginning
to end. A quick side note, if you see this movie and enjoyed it you may
wish to watch some of the Silent era films on TCM. Every Sunday night
they broadcast a silent film. The films pull you into another world,
another aspect of the human condition. You see these films without
voice sound but there is wonderful Music and acting that will make you
laugh and tug at your heart as any great film from today would do to
you. Again, &#x22;The Artist&#x22;, C&#x27;est Magnifique!
