No dialogues, no colors, no special effects but it entertains you more
than most of the big budget films releasing.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t talk about the story, because there&#x27;s more important thing than
that, which is how the story is told. That&#x27;s the greatest thing about
this movie. You are always involved in the movie. And it&#x27;s fast-paced,
you actually don&#x27;t even realize the absence of dialogues. <br /><br />Jean Dujardin did a brilliant job, you can&#x27;t find mistakes in his
acting, and considering the fact that it&#x27;s not easy to express your
feelings without dialogues. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo supported him quite well. But
the actor who stole the show is the Dog, here the credits go also to
the director.<br /><br />On the whole, The Artist is a must watch, I&#x27;m going with four stars out
of five! Highly Recommended!
