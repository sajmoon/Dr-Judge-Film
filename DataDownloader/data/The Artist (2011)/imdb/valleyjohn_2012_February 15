What with so many films up for awards being a big let down i was hoping
The Artist was a film that at least , lived up to it&#x27;s hype. Thankfully
it did.<br /><br />George Valentin is a famous silent movies start who is loved by himself
nearly as much as his fans. He meets , by chance , up and coming
actress Peppy Miller and he falls in love. The problem is that Peppy is
making it big in Talkies and George finds that silent movies are dying
along with his career.<br /><br />I never thought i would like a silent movie as much as i liked this
one. This is a very cleverly made film that keeps the audience
spellbound by some fantastic backing music and three brilliant
performances from Jean Dujardin , Berenice Bejo and a delightful little
Jack Russel.<br /><br />I love the first 15 miniues of this film. Jean Dujardin is in his
element both in the film and with his acting. The smile and swagger of
George is superb and you cant but help like the man. Berenice Bejo is
just the same. A lovely smile and wonderful attitude and you can see
why any man would fall for her.<br /><br />The film does dip a little in the middle and maybe could do with ten
minutes being shaved off it but apart from that The Artist is
everything that people are saying.
