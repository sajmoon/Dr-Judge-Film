A one point in the movie, where the clich&#xE9; is for music to swell, there
is silence instead. It was that silence that made the movie for me.<br /><br />Though this does follow the norms of a silent movie, it&#x27;s very much
like Modern Times (Chaplin, 1936), in that sound is being played with.
There is music throughout, and occasional humorous deviations.<br /><br />I thought the first half of the movie was okay, but I started seeing
where certain scenes were going. Contrast that with Modern Times, where
I hardly ever knew exactly where Chaplin was going, and he frequently
did things that amaze me every time I see them. Jean Dujardin will not
be replacing Buster Keaton. In a few spots, the movie even used CGI
effects. For being true to the original spirit, I thought Shadow of the
Vampire did a better job.<br /><br />For discussing flammability of film, Inglorious Basterds does a better
job, as does Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Sabotage (which cameos in I. B.). The
dog Uggie is top notch, though I liked Milo the Dog better in The Mask.<br /><br />I was comparing The Artist to all these other films, but then a moment
of silence happened at the right spot, and the film won me over. I
liked a lot of this film.<br /><br />Recommended.
