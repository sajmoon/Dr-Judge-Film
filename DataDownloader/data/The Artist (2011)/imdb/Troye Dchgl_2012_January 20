&#x22;The Artist&#x22; has proved so many things and I am certain this is going
to change a lot of people&#x27;s point of view on the arts of silence. &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; perhaps appears as a simple trip of nostalgia that brings us to
the past and reconnects with the beginning of films, but more
importantly it excels in a different manner and it shows us that silent
movies are not necessarily boring and that the lack of dialogue can be
masterfully turned into richer contents and depth.<br /><br />The two leads deliver solid performances and the background music is
incredible. All in all, this has been a wonderful experience and it has
blown me away.
