A film that challenges convention in such a bold way this does takes on
a heavy burden. It has to be brilliant. If it is only good, it will
fade into obscurity because &#x22;good&#x22; is easily achieved with the accepted
norm. On the surface, this film seems only to be catered to a certain
client&#xE8;le, but there is no doubting its significance and intrinsic
appeal. For along with drama, comedy, horror, and action, silent films
are an endearing cornerstone in film culture.<br /><br />On the face of things, this could go two ways, and this film rises to
the occasion in a way you&#x27;d never believe a film that, on paper, is
such a large step backward could even attempt, let alone carry off with
such conviction.<br /><br />What staggered me about this film was how unchallenging it was to
watch. You don&#x27;t need to alter they way your viewing style as much as
you would think to absorb the story. After all they say 90% of the way
we communicate is nonverbal. You never feel out of sync with the
emotion of the characters, mainly due to the fantastic acting and
scoring that allow the script to work at its maximum.<br /><br />Convention breaking novelties aside, French director Michel
Hazanavicius has created an astounding film that seems to almost
tangibly steer your emotions with a steering wheel. The two main
characters have a chemistry that seems almost effortlessly executed,
and a joy to watch. The context of the film being how pride can hold
you back while the world moves forward, and how people that care about
you refuse to give up on you.<br /><br />So my question, &#x22;how can such a large step backward be such a
monumental leap forward?&#x22;has been answered. Iconic characters, the
purity of emotions, exceptional soundtrack, and a brilliant story gel
with one another to create a cohesive, airtight master piece. You will
laugh, you will cry. But mostly laugh. After watching this film, I am
smitten by its distinct and appealing character. It is a fabulous movie
