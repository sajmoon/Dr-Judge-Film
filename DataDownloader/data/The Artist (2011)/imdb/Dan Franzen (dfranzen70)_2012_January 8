What chance in the world does a movie in which virtually no words are
spoken and is filmed in black in white have to succeed at winning the
hearts of Academy Award voters? If any of them bother to watch The
Artist, the chances should be astronomical. This is more than a work of
art. It surpasses the medium and our expectations. First, let me
explain about the mechanics of the movie. Like its ancestors, it is not
really silent; music accompanies just about every scene. Sometimes
title cards appear to indicate what a character has said, but these are
employed infrequently. Even ambient noise, like a cup being placed on a
table, are not heard. Each actor &#x22;speaks&#x22; his lines, and the most basic
ones are easily understood by the expressions. It&#x27;s not as difficult to
follow as it may sound.<br /><br />In The Artist, Jean Dujardin plays a silent-film actor named George
Valentin (sort of a cross between Rudolf Valentino and Douglas
Fairbanks, Sr.). He is the star of his time and makes a good living.
He&#x27;s married to his frequent costar, played by Penelope Anne Miller,
and he has an adorable Jack Russell terrier (a nod to the Thin Man
movies). In an instance of kismet, he meets fan/aspiring actress Peppy
Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo), for whom he finds a job as an extra in his
movie as a dancer (her name itself is probably a nod to the great Ann
Miller). And meanwhile, his wife Doris is, shall we say, unhappy with
George, noticing the chemistry between him and his new friend.<br /><br />Reminiscent of A Star Is Born, Peppy becomes popular while, with the
advent of talkies, George becomes less employable. No one wants to hear
people talk, he rants at his boss (John Goodman). He vows to make his
own movie &#x96; silent &#x96; with his own money. It opens on the same date as
Peppy&#x27;s big film, and it doesn&#x27;t do well.<br /><br />The plot is a simple rise-fall-rebirth drama. Its lack of complexity is
a huge asset here, as so much must be expressed visually. And what
visuals! The elegant shots from cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman
evoke sympathy, stark reality, compassion, humor, and love almost
effortlessly. The music is beautiful and well selected. This is a movie
about movies, after all, and, much like Singin&#x27; in the Rain was about
one actor&#x27;s approach to the new-fangled talking pictures, The Artist
shows us a different approach: George Valentin, realizing his career as
he knows it cannot continue, simultaneously understands that he is not
fit for the future, either. He cannot change, can he? Who, indeed,
would want to hear him talk?<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that virtually no words are spoken. As in Mel
Brooks&#x27; Silent Movie, there is some dialog near the very end of the
movie. But Dujardin and Bejo are so astounding, graceful, and sparkling
on screen that no sound is needed, let alone actual words. They are a
remarkable couple, she with the big eyes, coquettish wink, and impish
personality, and he with the debonair stare, the chiseled chin, and all
the raging self confidence that a stylish leading man should have. They
are perfect in this movie.<br /><br />I cannot stress how powerful and moving this movie is. It&#x27;s a stunning
achievement and wildly entertaining. It&#x27;s enthralling, capturing a far-
off time with impeccable, glistening accuracy. Director Michel
Hanzanavicius doesn&#x27;t miss a step in directing his cast &#x96; some of whom
are quite seasoned. There&#x27;s Goodman as the studio head and Miller as
the wife, and other familiar faces show up, such as Missi Pyle, James
Cromwell, Ed Lauter, and Malcolm McDowell. Hanzanavicius&#x27; movie isn&#x27;t
just evocative of the old 1920s films &#x96; it really seems to transport
you to a theater in the early part of the 20th century. It&#x27;s a lavish,
loving film that is absolutely packed with emotional scenes. It is, at
turns, joyous and devastating, but it is always, always a huge treat to
watch. It is, most definitely, one of the very best films of 2011.
