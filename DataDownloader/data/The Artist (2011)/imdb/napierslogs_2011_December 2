&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is an artist&#x27;s film; a tribute to the golden age of
movies. In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent film star
at the height of success. When the studios turn their attention to
talkies, George isn&#x27;t ready to make the transition. He continues to
watch the world in black &#x26; white and listen in silence.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t realized it yet, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a silent, black and
white film, and it&#x27;s great. Our hero, George Valentin, was created in
the vain of the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. He is funny,
charming, charismatic; he can do comedies, dramas, action-adventures;
he has a wife, adoring fans, and a dog. The dog is star number 2,
capable of playing dead or dancing in step with George.<br /><br />An adoring fan finds herself absorbing the spotlight after a chance
meeting with George. Not only can she keep up with him, but the world
is ready to hear the voice of Ms. Peppy Miller. She is not named
&#x22;Peppy&#x22; by accident.<br /><br />We have a delightful story of love; love of success, love of movies,
and love between George and Peppy. Dujardin has a wonderful comedic
touch to everything he does in this movie that the simple story line is
helped along with a healthy dose of comedy. He turns serious when The
Great Depression hits, but &#x22;The Artist&#x22; keeps chugging along with its
original, uplifting score, inventive scenes, and a finale that brings
us into the future.
