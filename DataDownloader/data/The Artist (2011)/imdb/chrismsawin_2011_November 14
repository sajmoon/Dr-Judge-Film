The Artist had quite the reputation going for it before it debuted at
the Cinema Arts Festival in Houston, Texas. Early reviews were already
very positive and many Houston critics were talking about how much they
were anticipating getting the chance to see it. I purposely went in
blind and only found out just moments before I entered the theater that
it was a silent film and was not only shot in but would be presented in
the now practically ancient 1.33:1 aspect ratio. A black and white
silent feature film made in modern times; what&#x27;s not to like about
that? Truth be told, nothing can really prepare you for how
extraordinary The Artist really is.<br /><br />George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the king of silent movies in
Hollywood in 1927. Audiences just adore everything George is a part of.
Along comes Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo) who you just know is going to
be a huge star some day. George and Peppy work together on one film as
George not only takes her under his wing, but an undeniable spark
develops between the two. Over the course of the next few years, silent
movies fade into obscurity as talking pictures or &#x22;talkies&#x22; explode
onto the scene. George finds himself struggling for not only work, but
a purpose to live as Peppy becomes the next big thing overnight.<br /><br />The Artist is funny and charming right out the gate. Jean Dujardin
really plays to the crowd and appears to love nothing more than
catering to the people who come to see his films. George&#x27;s dog Jack
might be the biggest form of comic relief in the film. The way he plays
dead and covers his head with his paws are always both presented in a
way that is fresh and laugh out loud funny each and every time they&#x27;re
utilized. Once B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo enters the picture, the film begins to
evolve into a type of romance. It&#x27;s odd though because to my
recollection George and Peppy never kiss. Peppy seems to steal the
spotlight in the same way George does as soon as you see her dance for
the first time. The laughs are there, the charms are there, The Artist
has a firm grip on your heart and your attention and never really lets
go.<br /><br />The film eventually begins to get a bit darker though as silent movies
wither away and talking pictures take their spot. George&#x27;s downward
spiral is really fantastic to watch. It&#x27;s mostly due to not only
Dujardin&#x27;s superb performance, but also the way many of these scenes
are filmed. There&#x27;s a scene where George is sitting down at a mirror
table drinking whiskey. You see nothing but George, his reflection, and
the alcohol. He pours the booze on the tabletop as the look of disgust
becomes more chiseled on his brow. That scene is so beyond amazing. The
brilliant music used in the film also just captures the time period
perfectly. There&#x27;s also this dream that George has right before he&#x27;s
let go from his contract where he can&#x27;t speak, but everything around
him has sound. That sequence is really spectacular, as well.<br /><br />The Artist can get a little dark at times, but for the most part is
extremely lighthearted and feel-good at its core. Never have I wanted a
movie to end on a happy note so badly in my life. Through the highs and
the lows of George Valentin and the depressing outcome of his career
along with the heartwarming sensation you get from nearly everything in
between, the entire experience just feels so real; so genuine. The
Artist is just pure perfection, a masterpiece, and an instant classic.
