What a treat. I left the theater sort of floating. Delighted. A
European film looking back at Hollywood better than Hollywood has been
able to do for years. &#x22;A Star Is Born&#x22; and &#x22;Singing In The Rain&#x22; mixed
in a glorious black and white cocktail. Silent, yes silent! But with a
fabulous score and so much panache. Jean Dujardin is the revelation of
the year. What a performance! Running the gamut of emotions, leaving us
breathless, and if this wasn&#x27;t enough, a rousing tap dance routine in
the style of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell, partnering with the
wonderful Berenice Bejo. I know that it&#x27;s not just me. The audience
applauded and cheered as the end credits rolled.
