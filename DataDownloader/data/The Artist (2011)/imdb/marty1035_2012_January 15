It&#x27;s time someone said &#x22;the Emperor has no clothes&#x22; -- this movie
sucked! And I love old movies, and silent movies -- was at Radio City
when Napoleon re-premiered, but his was just a really bad movie that
someone at production must have just gotten so sick of, they said to
&#x22;turn the damn sound off&#x22; and then forget to turn it back on before the
printed the copies, and then got released figuring it couldn&#x27;t be any
worse with sound and not worth the trouble re-printing. You could write
the plot on a matchbox, hell, you could write it on a match. And the
lack of a soundtrack just keeps you focused on their lips trying to
figure out what&#x27;s being said so you don&#x27;t focus on the (lack of)
acting. They can keep the thirteen bucks but I want my hour forty
minutes back!
