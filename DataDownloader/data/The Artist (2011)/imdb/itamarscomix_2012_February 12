I confess that I&#x27;m a sucker for films about filmmaking; I love them in
every form, shape and color. As a result I probably would have liked
The Artist no matter what. It&#x27;s a good movie by any measure, though; a
beautiful homage to the Hollywood of the 20&#x27;s, made with incredible
amounts of love and respect. The black and white cinematography is
perfectly gorgeous; it echoes the style of the 20&#x27;s but with a more
sensitive modern touch that makes every shot a work of art. Jean
Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo both deliver wonderful performances;
Dujardin in particular was clearly born to act in silent films. James
Cromwell is also terrific, even if some of the others, like John
Goodman, don&#x27;t fit in as well. The Artist is entertaining, funny and
also quite touching, Dujardin delivering huge amounts of emotion
without talking.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not a masterpiece, though, nor is it the best movie of the year.
The basic premise was explored long ago in Singing in the Rain, and The
Artist doesn&#x27;t have the same kind of timeless staying power; nor does
it have the cynical wit of Mel Brooks&#x27; Silent Movie. The Artist is
first and foremost a homage and a call-back, and it could have easily
have gone for a completely different plot. It works for what it is;
some clever things are done with the format, especially the first dream
sequence. But in its basis it remains not much more than a very good
silent movie, lots of fun for cinephiles and film history lovers -
actually, scratch that: it&#x27;s lots of fun for everyone.
