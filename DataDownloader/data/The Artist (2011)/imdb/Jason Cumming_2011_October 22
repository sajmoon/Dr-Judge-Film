This is a treat. Charismatic leads with chemistry and talent, in a love
story that plays as a pitch perfect homage to vintage Hollywood
features, whilst never tipping over into parody, and that&#x27;s no mean
feat. The period detail is outstanding: film stocks, tints, (heck even
the frame weave), captions and montage are all on the money. <br /><br />There&#x27;s an evocative score, an imaginative use of silence, wonderful
locations and costume. All rounded off by a top notch cast which
includes a brilliant dog. Dujardin is every inch the charming 20&#x27;s star
and Bejo is sassy, surefooted and gorgeous. Go see this people. They do
make &#x27;em like they used to!
