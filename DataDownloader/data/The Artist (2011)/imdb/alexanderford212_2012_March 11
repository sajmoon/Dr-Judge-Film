*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER .... PLEASE READ AT YOUR DISCRETION
***<br /><br />I had seen a ton of cinema....beginning from the 1890s to present day
to American, Italian, Japanese, French, German, British, Spanish, Latin
American....etc, etc, etc...including lots and lots of silent pictures,
therefore my film education is very well versed. <br /><br />Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s executive money management campaign always
works.....a little bit of proper marketing money does the trick.
Personally, I think this film is an insult to the silent cinema, not a
tribute. Anyone that had film education and saw at least the films of
Charlie Chaplin will have a tendency to agree with me.<br /><br />The storyline, while it exists, carries very little substance. <br /><br />As far as acting goes: Dujardin does deserve a Best Actor Oscar...the
film holds entirely on his acting. Directing was decent, although I do
believe in order to make a film more interesting, the cinematography
(or the way it is shot), could have been a lot more innovative, but
since the filmmaker resorted to attempting to &#x22;copy&#x22; silent films, the
entire cache of the picture got lost.<br /><br />**** WARNING - SPOILER BELOW ****<br /><br />But the story.....well here it goes: The film basically shows our
protagonist who is on top of his acting game and is a &#x22;superstar&#x22;, who
then &#x22;bumps into&#x22;, or rather she &#x22;bumps into him&#x22;....an &#x22;extra&#x22; or an
onlooker on set, whom he is charmed by....of course our film&#x27;s leading
lady, and our film director&#x27;s wife in real life. Next thing we know,
the silent era is over...the talking era begins and she becomes famous
and he becomes nothing by becoming an alcoholic and a
wimp.....literally a wimp. As soon as they start making &#x22;talking&#x22;
pictures in our film, our protagonist can no longer work all of the
sudden......but why? So a successful superstar turns into a wimp
overnight.....that does not hold true for Hollywood.....please DO NOT
underestimate the effect of star power.....please take a look at Mel
Gibson&#x27;s case and how long it took him to destroy himself, despite all
of the &#x22;charades&#x22; he threw out publicly....and if you wanted to compare
this film to the times of Charlie Chaplin would still be
absurd....Chaplin never lost his ability to make films, even when &#x22;The
Great Dictator&#x22; came out in 1940. That was not a silent film...it was a
talking picture, which is one of Chaplin&#x27;s most infamous pictures to
date....check it out via Criterion Collection, yet Chaplin was a silent
actor/filmmaker, but somehow still managed to make good, quality films
that were talking pictures.<br /><br />Continuing... Then our leading lady comes and rescues our leading man,
yet until the very end of the movie, it is really unclear (when you
think about it) why he is the guy she should be rescuing. He does not
&#x22;give her a start&#x22; in the movie industry...just because he adds a
&#x22;birthmark&#x22; above her lip in the beginning (clever Cindy Crawford
copycat citation there by the way....) does not mean she should be
rescuing him.<br /><br />In the end...everyone&#x27;s happy....the wimp is rescued by a &#x22;strong&#x22; lady
who was always obsessed with him, she didn&#x27;t actually love him, she
loved &#x22;the image&#x22; of this successful man....in today&#x27;s real life
example for instance, it would be the same as a regular girl obsessed
with George Clooney or Brad Pitt, but the story in this film wants to
make us believe that she loves him, when she actually does not, but
only in a movie can they attempt to get away with something like this. <br /><br />The bottom line? Best Picture? I don&#x27;t think so....nice try though.<br /><br />Of course, for people that go to movies in a movie theater &#x22;on a date&#x22;,
when they are all &#x22;into each other&#x22; and are concentrating more on each
other&#x27;s lips and are boiling with emotions because they can&#x27;t wait to
finish the movie and go home and shag....add a little popcorn and soda
and smiling characters on screen with somewhat existent story line in
today&#x27;s day and age will pass for today&#x27;s average viewer, but for
someone that understands what makes a real film work, I would
say....pass....or see it only for Dujardin&#x27;s acting.<br /><br />To close....I was not disappointed to be honest after I completed
watching this because after getting used to so much garbage that comes
out on screen during the course of the last 10- 15 years, finding a
truly unique picture with a profound storyline these days is a
surprise, therefore I did not expect much...but was curious why George
Clooney lost the Oscar to Dujardin. <br /><br />3/10 ... Sorry Mr. Michel Hazanavicius, I meant no disrespect to you or
to the film, but it is the job of the viewer to give each film a sober
and honest review, otherwise what good are our opinions?
