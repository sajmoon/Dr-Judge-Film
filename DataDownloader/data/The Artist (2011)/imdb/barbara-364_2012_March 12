This film was over much too quickly and created a world I didn&#x27;t want
to leave. It is a demonstration of the film- makers art to be able to
explain everything visually. After seeing The Artist I wondered if we
ever needed sound in films. George Valentin&#x27;s smile is infectious.
Without speech, facial expressions are everything. The sequence when
sound is added is visually witty and funny. Above all the music is
great. Rather than reproduce music from the time, the elements of the
1920s style have been reworked into an original and thoroughly
enjoyable film score. Elements of the film could stand alone. It could
be enjoyed in complete silence. The photography is stunning. The
clothes and sets are stylish. The music is great. Together they
sparkle.
