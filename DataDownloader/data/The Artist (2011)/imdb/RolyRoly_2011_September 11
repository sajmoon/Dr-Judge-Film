The Artist arrived at the Toronto International Film Festival preceded
by the accolades it received at Cannes, so expectations were high, but
those expectations have been more than amply fulfilled. This film is an
absolute marvel - charming, witty, surprising, moving, clever and
beautiful. Filmmaking is about decisions, thousands and thousands of
them, and everyone involved in The Artist makes every decision to
perfection. The cinematography is ravishing in luminous black and
white. The musical score, on which the film, being silent, is so
dependant, is subtle when it needs to be subtle, dramatic when the
occasion calls for it, and never overbearing or overwrought. The
screenplay (yes, silent films do have screenplays) toys with the
conventions of the silent era, paying homage to some of the greatest
films of the first two or three decades of cinema history. The acting
is flawless, extracting emotion and humour from a simple but classic
storyline. The direction displays such self-assurance, and treats the
audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue
with the director.<br /><br />The Artist is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I have ever
had. It deserves a wide audience and all sorts of awards. I can hardly
wait to see it again.<br /><br />And oh yes, if there is ever an Oscar for best animal performance, the
dog in The Artist should receive a lifetime achievement award for this
role alone.
