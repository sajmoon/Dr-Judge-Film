French director Michel Hazanavicius&#x27; surprise hit The Artist is a
charming recreation of the silent film era of the late 1920s that
focuses on how the advent of talking pictures spelled the end of
careers for those silent film stars who could not or would not make the
transition. Shot in color, then transferred to black and white, the
film&#x27;s combination of form and style captures a time of simplicity in
which movies reflected creativity and imagination as much as their
ability to make money. The film introduces the wonderful French actor
Jean Dujardin to Western audiences and he is irresistible with his
broad smile, thin mustache, and snappy dance steps that suggest Gene
Kelly and Fred Astaire.<br /><br />The artist in question is George Valentin (Dujardin), a silent screen
star who downplays the advent of talkies to his gruff producer Al
Zimmer (John Goodman), calling it a passing phase. George still has
thousands of loyal fans who swarm around him at every opportunity and
lives a life of comfort with a huge house in Hollywood, a lovely wife,
and a loyal dog. All of these comforts are threatened, however, when
George meets Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo), a dark-haired beauty who is
a talented dancer and actress with potential star power.<br /><br />Valentin begins a flirtation with her and, much to the chagrin of
George&#x27;s wife Doris (Penelope Anne Miller), they are photographed
together in Variety magazine, an incident that reminds Doris of how
unhappy she is with George and eventually leads to the breakup of their
marriage. George is called yesterday&#x27;s man by his producer and, as
Peppy starts to climb the ladder to success, George&#x27;s star recedes, but
he does not give up easily. Refusing to participate in talking films,
he leaves Zimmer and sets up his own company to produce a silent
adventure film but it bombs at the box office while people line up to
see Peppy in her debut films.<br /><br />As a result of George&#x27;s reluctance to act in talkies and the stock
market crash of 1929, he loses his loyal driver Clifton (James
Cromwell) and falls into bankruptcy and flirts with alcoholism. One
member of the family always by George&#x27;s side, however, is his loyal
dog, a loving companion whose swift-footed action saves his life when
he is trapped inside a burning house. Peppy remains his friend and
looks after George when he is injured in the fire and brings him to her
house to convalesce. Though she admittedly used him to get her break in
the industry, Peppy sincerely wants to have George get back into acting
and offers him a script reluctantly approved by Zimmer, but he demurs.<br /><br />Before despair takes further hold, however, the film takes you where
you would least expect to go and surprise follows surprise. An homage
to the comedies and musicals of the silent era, The Artist is a film
that bursts with enthusiasm and life. Though it may be lightweight
(some have even called it &#x22;fluff&#x22;), it can nonetheless break new ground
if it can serve as a reminder, not only of what we have lost in our
films with their increasing subservience to technology and corporate
greed but, more importantly, of what has gone missing from the quality
of our lives.
