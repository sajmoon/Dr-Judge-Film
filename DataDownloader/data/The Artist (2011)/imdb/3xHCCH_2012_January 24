&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is the odds on favorite now to get the Oscar Best Picture
crown, since it had just won the Producers&#x27; Guild nod. Everything about
it will make you think twice before watching it. It is a SILENT film,
in BLACK AND WHITE, with unknown FRENCH actors. Thanks to the awards
hype it is getting though, audiences will search this out, as did I.<br /><br />The story is not the biggest selling point of the film. It is silent,
so there can only be so much that can be told by facial expressions,
big actions and the occasional dialog card. The story line is very
simple, and very familiar, and can be summarized in one sentence: It is
about a silent film star who will eventually be surpassed in the
industry by the girl he helped get into films, just as silents gave way
to talkies in the 1930s. If this same story was told in the current
way, it would have been panned. So the novelty gimmick of
director/writer Michel Hazanavicius worked in this case, but I do not
think it will revive a trend for black &#x26; white silent films.<br /><br />The lead character George Valentin is played by Jean Dujandin. The
starlet he helped launch Peppy Miller is played by Berenice Bejo. The
lead actors were both very charming. They possess the facial qualities
which convince us that they were indeed from that era of film. The
debonair Dujardin, in particular, goes through the gamut of emotion
without a word uttered until the very end. This will make him a prime
candidate for Oscar&#x27;s Best Actor, a prize he already won in Cannes.
Much have been said about the character of Valentin&#x27;s dog, played by
Jack Russell terrier Uggie. He&#x27;s cute alright, but to push him for Best
Supporting Actor is a stretch.
