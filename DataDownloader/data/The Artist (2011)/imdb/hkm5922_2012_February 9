Sorry, but my wife and I both felt this movie was &#x22;an interesting
exercise&#x22; but it tended to drag. The casting was excellent, especially
the part of Peppy Miller---she is a winner!! She sparkles in every
scene she&#x27;s in and really steals the entire show. WE&#x27;d love to see her
in future productions. The actor who did Valentin was very clearly in
the part and portrayed the character quite well, but he had an odd
script to work with. John Goodman was excellent in his role as the &#x22;Big
Producer&#x22;. But we can&#x27;t understand what in the movie made it an Academy
Award candidate. Maybe it was because it was foreign-made. But we
wouldn&#x27;t see it again. It was &#x22;okay&#x22; on a rainy evening. But we can&#x27;t
recommend it to our friends. Sorry. Harry C.
