This film is highly recommended.<br /><br />&#x22; Dreams can come true again, When ev&#x27;ry thing old is new again. &#x22; <br /><br />- Lyrics by Peter Allen <br /><br />Michel Hazanavicius&#x27; The Artist is a fine homage to the heydays of
early cinema. It is 1927 and the arrival of &#x22;talkies&#x22; is about to
change the silent film industry and those who are unable to transition
to this new process. One of those soon-to-be victims is Hollywood movie
star George Valentin ( Jean Dujardin ). A top matin&#xE9;e idol ( ala the
real John Gilbert ) accustomed to fame and the fortune or misfortune it
brings, Valentin meets cute an adoring fan named Peppy ( B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo
). Soon Peppy becomes a rising ing&#xE9;nue on the road to stardom while his
life begins to descend into alcohol and poverty. <br /><br />Yes, the plot is mighty familiar, but bear with it. With the film being
basically silent, the overall visual look of the film must greatly
compensate for the lack of words and dialog. And that is just what
happens in this marvelous film, as it captivates and transports the
moviegoer back to a more innocent time.<br /><br />The Artist is a rather conventional mash-up of Singin&#x27; in the Rain with
A Star is Born. Yet it completely won me over with its masterful
direction and period details. ( I realized this about 20 minutes into
the film during one terrific dream sequence where sound effects
abruptly broke the &#x22;silence&#x22; barrier. ) Shooting the film in 1.33:1
ratio and in glorious black &#x26; white, just as those silent films were
initially seen, is more than a mere gimmick in Hazanavicius&#x27; vision. He
takes his appreciation of his film subject seriously and adds his
modern spin to this film while staying entrenched in that revered
cinematic style.<br /><br />The film is done mostly without dialog, albeit title cards playing a
significant role as does a continuous musical soundtrack that
highlights the action on the screen. The director, who also wrote the
screenplay, tends to borrow too heavily from some musical choices (as
with Hermann&#x27;s Vertigo score ) and some film masterworks ( like Orson
Welles&#x27; Citizen Kane, The Mark of Zorro with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,
and Wilder&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard, loyal chauffeur and all. Some may say
these touches are only inspired from other sources, others might
question the film&#x27;s lack of originality. )<br /><br />But the film has certified moments of pure genius intermixed with
scenes of high melodrama. There are scenes of such wit and charm ( a
musical dance number remindful of that of Astaire and Rogers ; a
slightly surreal moment with a young starlet embracing a coat-rack that
seems to come to life; a dinner table scene that owes much to passage
of time tableaux from the aforementioned Kane, etc. ) that dazzles the
movie audience. ( At the film&#x27;s end, there was spontaneous applause
heard throughout the theater. )<br /><br />Another plus to the film&#x27;s winning demeanor is the central casting of
the two main actors. Dujardin plays Valentin as a proud and vain
peacock of a man. He can emote like the silent film stars of
yesteryear, brandishing his handsomeness and profile to extremes and
the next moment bringing a Chaplinesque quality to the more vulnerable
side of this man&#x27;s personality. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo radiates that sunny and
&#x22;peppy&#x22; quality needed for her character to become fully realized. Her
loving and caring nature provides the essence for romance within the
story. ( Special mention goes to Uggie the Dog for proving once again
that we humans can be so easily upstaged by our four-legged friends.)<br /><br />The Artist is an affectionate love letter to the silent film era and
Hollywood itself. As the old adage says, &#x22;Silence is golden.&#x22; And so is
this delightful film. GRADE: B+<br /><br />NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com
