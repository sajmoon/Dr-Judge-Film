This film is a pointless, dull, pretentious, and absurdly over-hyped
waste of two hours. We both couldn&#x27;t wait until it was over and by the
reaction in the theater most felt the same. There&#x27;s a reason films have
a soundtrack. It makes them interesting. I identified with the hapless
audience watching Valentin&#x27;s last silent film after the talkies were
introduced. Mugging for the camera is not a skill I wish to pay money
for and other than tap dancing that&#x27;s all you get. I am amazed at the
way in which people followed the critics like sheep. Its a shame this
film won anything, let alone an Oscar. Oh, there is the dog. Everyone
likes the dog
