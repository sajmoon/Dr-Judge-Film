This film is about a silent film star fading, as he could not cope with
the fast changing times.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a black and white, and has no dialog. What used to be
the norm back in the 1920&#x27;s is now almost a groundbreaking experience.
Stripping a film of its computer effects, lavish sets and even the
dialogs, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; brings back a cinematic experience that is
forgotten to the point that is almost foreign.<br /><br />The music is captivating throughout. The story is well presented, with
much emotional depth even without the use of dialogs. George Valentin&#x27;s
frustration, shattered pride and depression is portrayed; while Peppy
Miller&#x27;s secret admiration for George is noble and selfless. The climax
is gripping, and I like the lighter ending. I think &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a
gem that deserves to win some Oscars.
