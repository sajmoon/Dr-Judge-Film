2012_January 5 
I liked this movie, but it reminded me a bit of Dr. Johnson&#x27;s dog
walking on its two hind legs: it was noteworthy only because it could
be done at all. (The real dog in The Artist is one of the best things
in the film.) Otherwise, I was principally struck by the camera work.
The film seems largely true in its sets, costumes, music and, most
especially, in the over-sized, operatic acting that is necessary for a
silent. But the camera work is oddly, relentlessly modern. The
filmmaker avoids antique devises (there was one iris-in; no wipes or
dissolves). The editing is quick. There was a lot more tracking and
dollying than I think would be the case in your average silent where
the actors spend more time moving about in a static establishing shot.<br /><br />So we are left with an odd conclusion: the filmmaker (or the producers)
evidently decided that we would pay money to see a silent film only if
it was not VISUALLY true to the silent era. And, after all is said and
done, we get exactly what the movie is: a modern film pretending to be
a silent.
