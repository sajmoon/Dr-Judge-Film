I don&#x27;t quite know what to say about this film. Let me start by saying
that my parents and I, who all love film, were somewhat unexcited to
see this film. We read the reviews and we are always in tune with the
Oscar hype and we went to see it, almost out of a sense of duty. Good
lord were we wrong. It is one of the most unique films I have ever
seen. It&#x27;s groundbreaking in the sense that it reminds us that you can
have a poignant story without words, not to mention special effects.
However, groundbreaking implies that it will create a series of films
in the same vein. This is not true either. Silent film is not making a
comeback. This is just a bright shining gem in filmmaking &#x96; one of the
best in a long time in my opinion. It&#x27;s probably going to sweep the
Oscars, it certainly deserves to. As many nominations as it has, I
actually think that either John Goodman or James Cromwell should have
been nominated in the BSA category. Whoever allowed a filmmaker like
Michel Hazanavicius to make this film the way he wanted to deserves now
all the accolades that this film will receive after the Oscars. It&#x27;s
going to blow up, if it already hasn&#x27;t &#x96; and it deserves to. Make sure
you see it in the theater though, won&#x27;t translate to DVD as well.
