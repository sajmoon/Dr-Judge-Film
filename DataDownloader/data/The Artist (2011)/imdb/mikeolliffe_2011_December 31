I never excuse film-makers for failing to get right the world of either
newspapers or television. A little research is all it takes.<br /><br />But for film-makers to get wrong their own industry!? Which is what
they did in The Artist. They completely mixed up the roles of producer
and director. John Goodman was obviously the &#x27;producer&#x27; but he also
seemed to be the &#x27;director&#x27; as well.It&#x27;s possible in real life to have
a producer/director/even star in the form of one person. But that would
have been rare in the time period portrayed. (I&#x27;m standing by for a
deluge of examples proving me wrong).<br /><br />None of that was enough to stop me liking - and recommending - this
film. People with a bit of experience of the industry (and life in
general)will realize that some things have been left out of the
screenplay.<br /><br />But the remaining message - that there are decent, nice people in the
world of movie-making - is a heartening one.
