A Masterpiece of Silent Monologue.<br /><br />The Artist is an excellent film, especially a silent film in 2011 which
is directed by French director Michel Hazanavicius, and this film
brings us back to the early 1920&#x27;s silent era of motion picture making
in Hollywood, which tells the story of a former silent film star who
got trapped in silent films when a new fashion of talkies arise and
take over the silent films. It is one of the notable improvement
occurred in the film making with the synchronized dialogue and songs.
The Artist resembles painting, music and literature in a celluloid
format and holds the attention of an audience for 1 hour 40 minutes
without flagging. <br /><br />The story is set in the early 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) was
a famous silent movie star and he was a dedicated actor who apparently
meets a young woman named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) an ambitious
actress from the town who dreams of becomes a famous actress. When the
talking picture is being introduced into the film industry, most of the
director and producers were ready to invest in making talkies. Al
Zimmer (John Goodman) the noted producer who offers George Valentin for
a lead role in his upcoming talkie film, but George denied. However on
the contrary Peppy Miller getting a chance for some small roles as a
background artist in the films, later she becomes a remarkable star in
talkies. Simultaneously George Valentin was broke and become weaker day
by day and his fame starts fading away. The remaining story discloses
how George Valentin wins back his fame and the conflicts between George
Valentin and Peppy Miller. Further the movie reveals other conflicts
such as, Pride vs. Fame, Film Stars vs. Studio, Silent vs. Talkies,
Fame vs. Money, Fame vs. Society, Love vs. Loss, Personal life vs.
Career life, etc. <br /><br />A Journey of Pride &#x22;With Pleasure&#x22; <br /><br />The Artist is a journey of one&#x27;s own pride and dignity. The pivotal
role George Valentin played by Jean Dujardin who was portrayed as a
1920&#x27;s movie star with a thin mustache, with his partner and actor Jack
Russell terrier dog named Uggie. Jean Dujardin great performance is
given a solid support to the script. He won Best Actor in 2011 Cannes
Film Festival and 2012 Academy Awards, etc. However at the same time
B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo appears as an innocent, fun-loving young woman who is an
aspiring actress &#x26; dancer with interest and her performance is
unforgettable. Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) who was portrayed as an
unhappy wife of George Valentin. From the beginning this script leaving
the viewer wondering, why George Valentin doesn&#x27;t want to commit on
talkies rather than silent films and finally at the end its putting
forward the reason for his denial. The core subject of the film was
dealing with ones&#x27;s individual pride and plays around the star image
and the fame which is something illusion, and it appears as well as it
can fade. The Screenplay and film narrative is delightfully fun with
tragedy and also aesthetically done. Particularly the comic depiction
of characterization made the film quite more interesting. This film
reminds us the 1952 film &#x27;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x27; and also the characters
such as Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). <br /><br />Director Michel Hazanavicius expertly conveys the life of an actor who
lived in the silent film era and this film proved extremely popular and
received 10 nominations for the 84th Academy Award and won 5 out of 10
including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Actor
and Best Costume. The Artist was filmed in colour and converted into
the black/white and also presented in 4:3 aspect ratio which is
commonly used format in the silent era in order to recreate the look
and feel of 1920&#x27;s silent film. The absence of the dialogue
concentrates the viewer&#x27;s attention more closely on the visuals and
gestures thus the whole film crew who had done a great job, especially
in the lighting and camera works, the very ordinary shots are often so
impressive. The crew team who has rendered the peculiar possibilities
of lighting and cinematographic techniques and to apply them towards
the creation of artistic production in order to achieve an artistic
result. <br /><br />Result: The Artist is a romantic comedy melodrama with pride, fame,
mute, success, romance, love, loss, desire, emotional conflicts,
tragedy, fun, entertainment, brilliant performance and it&#x27;s worth
watching on the screen. <br /><br />The Artist : An artist&#x27;s stroke on celluloid. <br /><br />Related Movies: Singin&#x27; in the Rain 1952, A Star is Born 1937 &#x26; 1954,
Thin Man 1934, etc. <br /><br />Sunday, March 4, 2012
