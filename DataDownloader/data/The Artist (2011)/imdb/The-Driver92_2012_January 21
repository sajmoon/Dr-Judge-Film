2012_January 21 
I won&#x27;t rehash the praise that other reviewers have given this movie;
it&#x27;s all true and then some. I loved the movie and found it poignant to
the point of discomfort at times. It&#x27;s a great movie and deserves all
of the compliments heaped upon it.<br /><br />The only piece I wish to add is more praise for Uggi, the terrier that
plays &#x22;Jack&#x22;, the dog. His performance is an integral part of this
film, and no, I&#x27;m not exaggerating for effect.<br /><br />Not to mention that he plays the type of stalwart, loyal companion that
we all need in our life as we make our way through this world...<br /><br />A timeless masterpiece for the ages...and one of the very best films of
the 2011.
