2011_December 27 
The praise is well deserved and this is the best film I&#x27;ve seen for a
while. OSS117 is a very pleasant surprise. Berenice Bejo is exactly
what she should be. In smaller parts, John Goodman mugs exceedingly
well, James Cromwell is excellent and the dog is superb. If you&#x27;ve ever
enjoyed a silent film, you&#x27;ll like this one. If you don&#x27;t like silent
films, you won&#x27;t like this one either. If you&#x27;ve never seen one, you
probably won&#x27;t like them -- most people don&#x27;t -- but maybe you&#x27;re one
of the few.... Now, to reach the minimum length for reviews (!), I&#x27;ll
add that the film&#x27;s use of selective silence to emphasize the tension
between talkies and silents is very clever and that the happy ending is
a great relief. I&#x27;ve always thought A Star Is Born is just too
depressing to watch twice.
