The Acting In This Movie is absolutely spot on by Jean Dujardin who is
charismatic,funny and excellent as George Valentin,who is a rich
superstar of the silent film era. Supporting Actress Berenice Bejo also
does a very good job as Peppy Miller who is the superstar of the first
talking movies. <br /><br />Director and Writer Michel Hazanavicius has done an amazing job in
direction by having the guts to make a silent movie in this era, and
has written a very good script for the movie also. He shows us how the
silent movies were and how the talking movies started in Hollywood, and
has shown Hollywood in the 1920-1930 excellently,how the movies were
shot in the sets,how the locations have changed from then to today and
he deserves some recognization for this movie. <br /><br />The Background Score For This movie had to be spot on and it did not
disappoint as music director Ludovic Bource has given very good music
in the movie, and should get the award for best original score.<br /><br />Finally, The Movie for me is one of the best of 2011 and has
Hazanavicius has re-invented the magic of silent movies through this,
and through great acting from the leading actors, this is bound to get
many awards.
