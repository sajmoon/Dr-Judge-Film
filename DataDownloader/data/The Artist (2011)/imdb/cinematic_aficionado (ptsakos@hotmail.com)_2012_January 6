From the opening credits, the audience is instantly transported to the
golden age of Hollywood. We then follow the story, set in the 1920&#x27;s,
of George Valentin, a renowned silent era actor who refuses to adapt to
the new technology that introduces sound to the films and pays the
price, and his acquaintance with dancer Peppy Miller.<br /><br />I would rather stick to impressions of the film without further
references to the development of the story out of concern it might
spoil it for those who have not yet seen it.<br /><br />As one watches &#x22;The Artist&#x22; feels like being part of another era,
bygone, of cinema; the glamour, the originality, the ambiance is all
there. The story line flows seamlessly and is enriched with elements of
emotion, tension, consequence of pride, as well as struggle with
conscience. The audience is not just in for a great film but will be
effortlessly seduced by its abundance of charm. Though silent it speaks
loud and it will also move, perhaps even stir its viewers. In times
where hi-tech visuals often carry the weight of films instead of its
actors, it was refreshing to see a movie where technology actually
serves hypocritic talent. To the above we must add spotless
performances by the leading actors and an exquisite cinematography,
whereby every scene is skilfully and beautifully shot.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a cinematic delight that will cause joy,
sorrow, sadness, even anguish, thus leaving the theatre with a sense of
exhilaration. And that&#x27;s no little feat.
