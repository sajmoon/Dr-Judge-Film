As many viewers have noted, The Claim has much in common visually with
McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Like Altman's much more entertaining and
memorable film, The Claim offers gorgeous cinematography replete with
snow-covered mountain vistas, realistic sets of a gritty pioneer mining
town, and authentically costumed anti-heroic characters highlighted by
a contingent of distinctly non-glamorous prostitutes. Its highly
evocative musical score includes a stunningly original and effective
diegetic use of the Portuguese fado.<br /><br />In addition, The Claim offers some fascinating period details about the
creation of the railroad and other little-seen aspects of 19th century
pioneer life (like the medicinal use of electricity!). It also offers
some stunning special effect fire and explosion sequences and generally
fine acting (despite the dubious casting of Wes Bentley and Sarah
Polley as the romantic leads). All in all, The Claim is in many
respects a worthy latecomer to the revisionist school of the Western
genre and is definitely worth viewing.<br /><br />However, it does have a serious weakness that I believe derives from
its verbally minimalist adaptation of a classic literary text, The
Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. In place of Hardy's verbally
constructed world of dark consuming passions, cosmic irony, and heavy
fatalism, The Claim offers a visually rich but emotionally remote,
dreamlike air that some critics have described as richly poetic, but
that left me often feeling utterly disconnected from the events
befalling the major characters.<br /><br />Establishing characters' motivations and building/releasing tensions in
their relationships is just a whole lot easier to do if words are
allowed to reinforce (not substitute for) images. Instead, The Claim
seems like it was filmed directly from a treatment that offered only
the barest smattering of dialogue. In a story that wasn't so dependent
on character this approach might have worked much better than it does
here.
