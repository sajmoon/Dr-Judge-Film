2001_May 7 

I must say, I for one was impressed with this film.  The beauty and the
majestic, Wintry look.  When the film first appeared on the screen, there
was an big aahhh.......from the audience.  It was like being right in the
middle of that open Mountain  Landscape.  The performances were good, the
Burning scene was really tense to me, I am still thinking about that.  I
have long been a dedicated fan of Natassia Kinski since I saw her in the
film &quot;TESS&quot;, which is part of the reason I wanted to see this film.  She
was
so great in her role as Hope's Mom, the character of Elena was sad and
haunting.  I wish that they had made this movie a little longer. Milla
Jovovich as Lucia, well I am at lost for words, her singing put the icing
on
the saloon scenes.  A must see, if you like good scenery, beautiful film
scores and character study.  A must see on the Big screen.
