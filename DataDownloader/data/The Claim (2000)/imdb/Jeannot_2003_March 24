loosely based on Hardy's THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, featuring a man who
sells his wife and child.  I agree with earlier comments that there are
similarities to HEAVEN'S GATE (I was one of three people in the country who
thought HG was pretty good; my wife was another), and MCCABE AND MRS
MILLER.<br /><br />I also agree with those who said the plot and flashbacks are a little
confusing, tho maybe this is only because I wasn't attentive enough.  Mila
Jovovich was good; at least, she was not as hysterical as she was in THE
MESSENGER.  <br /><br />BTW, as I recall in the novel, the mayor loses his interest in  his supposed
daughter when he finds out she really isn't his daughter.  In the movie,
tho, the Sarah Polley character just walks coldly away when she finds out
she is his daughter.  The result in both cases of course is
alienation.<br /><br />I thought the cinematography and acting were excellent.
