I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this DVD for $4. The cover showed
one of those forgettable
everybody-stare-at-the-camera-and-try-to-look-cool&#x22; images, and the
title itself makes it seem like a forgettable pulp novel. &#x22;The Claim&#x22;.
Wooooo. The only reason I bought it was because I&#x27;m a fan of Natassja
Kinski.<br /><br />Well, Natassja didn&#x27;t really have a leading role; instead the film
focused mostly on Peter Mullan as Mr. Dillon, the wealthy, powerful
owner of &#x22;Kingdom Come&#x22;, a small but promising town at the base of the
Sierra Nevada mountains. Although there are several interesting
subplots, the story is about him, and Mullan delivers an excellent
performance. He is neither good nor evil but a believable human
character who is caught up in his ambition.<br /><br />...which leads me to the title of my review. I highly recommend you
read the short poem &#x22;Ozymandias&#x22; by Percy Shelley before watching this
film. The film itself uses it briefly in the beginning where a stage
performer recites parts of it to an audience. This immediately piqued
my interest, since Ozy is one of my favourite poems. As the story
progressed, I realized that this injection was not trivial; the film is
essentially built on the story of Ozymandias, and once you realize
that, you&#x27;ll be able to focus on the main theme.<br /><br />As I said, there are several sub-themes that are interwoven: Milla
Jovovich plays a great role of a singer who&#x27;s not the &#x22;marrying type&#x22;
(and by the way, she sings some great Portugese songs). Wes Bentley
plays a young official for the railroad, sort of a play-by-the-rules
boyscout type who is at odds with the subjective rules of the old west.
Natassja is a woman slowly dying of consumption and haunted by a bitter
past. Sarah Polley is her daughter, innocent and oblivious but learning
quickly. They all deliver great performances with my only criticism
being their accents which are a little too modern, but if you can
overlook that, there&#x27;s no problem.<br /><br />The director used some unusual techniques which caught my attention.
For one thing, when switching to dream sequences, he didn&#x27;t do the
stereotypical sepia tint and harp plucking to announce &#x22;hey we&#x27;re going
to a dream sequence&#x22;. It may confuse you at first, but it keeps you on
your toes.<br /><br />This film has a very epic feel to it, perhaps like Sergio Leone&#x27;s
classic &#x22;Once Upon a Time in the West&#x22;, and at just under 2 hours, the
length and pacing seem right. But somehow I didn&#x27;t quite get as much
character development as I would&#x27;ve wanted. I suppose that&#x27;s plain
math... if we have 5 main characters, that gives each one only 24
minutes. Less if you consider that the main focus is on Mullan. But
perhaps upon repeated viewings, you can get more of a story on each of
them.<br /><br />One other criticism I have is that the musical score wasn&#x27;t very
dynamic. It seemed to repeat the same 2 sweeping chords over &#x26; over.
Then silence. Then back to the same 2 chords. Repeat. But this is a
minor criticism, and I doubt you would&#x27;ve even noticed it had I not
said anything. Oopsie, sorry bout that. But like I said earlier,
Milla&#x27;s singing provides enough to impress us musically.<br /><br />Overall, it&#x27;s a good film and a great interpretation of Ozymandias in
the Old West (again I urge you to read the poem so you may find the
same beauty in the film as I did). Also if you have a Blockbuster near
you, check out the used pile where you can find this for $4. Definitely
worth the price.
