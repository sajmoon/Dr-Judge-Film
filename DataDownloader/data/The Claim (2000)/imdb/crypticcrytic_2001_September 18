This film is as much a western as your Western Civ class back in college was
about cowboys. Though it is hard to classify (Historical fiction/Love
story/Drama) it isn't hard to watch. Perhaps a familiarity with Thomas
Hardy's &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; will give you a greater depth of
understanding, though it only seemed to get in the way of some reviewers on
this page.<br /><br />You say there are some elements of the classic western in this flick: good
guys, bad guys, saloon brawls, big hats, horses, gunfights, building a
railroad, dancehall ladies. No, it's much greater than just the sum of these
parts.<br /><br />Early in the tale, roles are clearly defined. Dalglish(Wes Bentley) is a
fair-minded gentleman/adventurer/engineer working on the railroad connecting
both coasts. Then there's the sweet young thing (Sarah Polley), vulnerable
while remaining faithful to the care giving duties to an ailing mother
(Nastassja Kinski).  The stern master, Mr. Dillon (Peter Mullen), has an
ugly secret: putting ambition (all to literally) before family. The tough
dance hall singer, Lucia (Milla Jojovich), Mr. Dillon's mistress and
stronger than most insinuates herself into every part of this story. <br /><br />Hope (sweet young thing) does mom's bidding to deliver a message bringing
closure to a 20 year-old wrong. When she does, is Mr. Dillon, the benevolent
leader, transformed and humbled by life's events? Or is he the conniving
empire builder willing to do just about anything to win - railroads, women,
his legacy. Email me if you can decide. In the end, Dillon is faced with
that dilemma and watches his life crumble. In Lucia, I was reminded of the
influence that women had on building the western US.  <br /><br />Burns, the original stakeholder of Kingdom Come stated it prophetically
that, &quot;A man loses heart out here without a woman.&quot; Love figures prominently
the lives of all of the main characters. And it's more than just something
to keep them warm in the cold Sierra Nevada's.<br /><br />Michael Nyman's score is superb as is the cinematography. We see a piano
prominently in this film as we saw it in his earlier film, 'The Piano.' (but
you could have guessed that one).<br /><br />This film may give you a new perspective on the role we play in the building
of  life's enterprise.  Some catalyze, others support, and then there are
those who just get in the way. Or it may just be another
western.
