A super but frustrating film from the master of self-evident narrative.
Winterbottom tells the story through the drama of landscape, action and
relationship - even in flashback there is no voice-over or exposition
woven into the script.<br /><br />However, this means that the script must be delivered clearly. My
summary joke about the climate muting annunciation may be half true,
although a cast largely using pioneer-Irish + a Portugese make us
heavily reliant on the action. And on the score - a curious choice of
British provenance which kept making me think I was watching a Mike
Leigh film...<br /><br />Luckily the acting is first class from many, particularly Peter
Mullan's Faustian Dillon and Wes Bentley's fast-maturing Dalglish, who
narrowly avoids the same moral crevasse. Mention also for Sarah Polley,
and a trouper of UK screens (big and small) Sean McGinley as Sweetly.
Throw in beautiful filming (can't go wrong with this landscape) and an
extraordinary vision of purgatory as a final sequence and you have 7/10
