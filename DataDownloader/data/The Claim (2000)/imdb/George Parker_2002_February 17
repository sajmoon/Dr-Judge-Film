&quot;The Claim&quot; tells the tale of a '49er (Mullen) with the glitter of gold in
his eyes who swaps his wife and baby for a claim in the rugged California
Sierra-Nevada mountains. A beautifully filmed period piece which attempts
to
portray the difficulties and realities of the time with fidelity, &quot;The
Claim&quot; offers excellence in all aspects of the film though it may be too
austere, too Spartan to have broad appeal. A great film for realists into
stories of the old West.
