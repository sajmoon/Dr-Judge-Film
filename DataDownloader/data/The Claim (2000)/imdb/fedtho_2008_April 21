2008_April 21 
Every time I catch this movie, I&#39;m reminded of the haunting,
overwhelming spell I experienced with works like Cimino&#39;s &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;
or &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate&quot; (as well as several others) that convey this raw
feeling of &quot;being there&quot; mixed with lyrical, poetic power. They seem
the result of a mysteriously invisible success at combining rhythm,
camera work, set design, sound, acting and what not.<br /><br />Funny, though, how each time, I&#39;m left with a drilling question: &quot;what
is *wrong* with this incredibly inspired movie?&quot; I found some answers
reading the following reviews: I almost completely second the views of<br /><br />1. sumrrain, April 25th 2001, who mostly nails my feelings better than
I could have *AND* offers some possible explanations as to what
prevents the movie from being even better;<br /><br />I found also found valuable ideas in the review by<br /><br />2. gpadillo, November 9th 2004: I haven&#39;t read Hardy&#39;s book, but I like
to hear gpadillo&#39;s take on, amongst other things, what kind of
adaptation we are dealing with here.<br /><br />Now, I personally feel the urge to give credit to Sarah Polley&#39;s
performance. Her presence in most every scene she appears in is so
intense and profound as we perceive the multiple layers and the
strength in this girl much less fragile and lost than she appears. As I
see it, she provides the second underlying main story, hidden literally
by the more spectacular Mullan and Kinski, just as well as her
character is sort of hidden and hushed to silence by the painful
relationship between her parents.<br /><br />I can&#39;t think of a lot of &quot;young women coming of age&quot; characters
portrayed this powerfully. Nathalie Portman in &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; as
well as Bryce Dallas Howard in &quot;The Village&quot; come to my mind; not much
more, in my very subjective opinion. Both actresses which I have
tremendous respect for (and I really couldn&#39;t care less if Portman made
some career choices considered as &quot;poor&quot;, or sometimes unfortunate...)<br /><br />This is one of the most ambitious and successful cinematic challenges
undertaken in the last ten years, and I really think one can hardly
afford to skip it if interested in what a big budget movie *still* can
be nowadays.
