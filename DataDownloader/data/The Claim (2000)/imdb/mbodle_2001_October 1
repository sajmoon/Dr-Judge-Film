Based on Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, the troubled main
character
deals with the results of an early life decision that led to his acquiring
great wealth at the expense of real love and commitment.  The story is
transported to Gold Rush days in the Rockies and filmed in Alberta, Canada
and Colorado entirely during winter. It is hard to imagine what the cast
and
crew must have endured, although the characters seem perfectly comfortable,
or at least fully adapted to, their wintry conditons.  I don't think any of
the cold breath fog is digital.<br /><br />A breath-taking image brought Fitzcarraldo's boat being dragged over rain
forest mountains to mind.  However, the sight of Dillon's house gliding
through snowy fir forests was still very memorable. The snow-covered trees
part as a two-tiered wedding cake of a house slides through them. Grand
scale, visually captivating mountain vistas, strong character development,
underplayed acting and excellent period re-creation of a Gold Rush boom
town.<br /><br />
