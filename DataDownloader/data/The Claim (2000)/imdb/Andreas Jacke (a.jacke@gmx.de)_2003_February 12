This film from Michael Winterbottom was the only film I saw twice
on
the last year on Berlinale. It was a great event. To the story: &quot;The change&quot;
- my wife and daughter for your gold was a great mistake, a sin, and the man
who do this know this. That's the tragedy of the hole film, he never will
become happy, because he is only rich (and that is not nothing  but never
enough). Later when his wife is come back to his town, because her husband
is dead and she had no money (the film is starting her)
the
man goes back to comunitiy, because his house was taking from the mountain
to the city. But than he lost - first his wife, who was ill, and than
is
city, because the train will come but it goes not to this town. At last he
is dying - because he rich, with all his gold, but without society,
love
and power anymore. He daughter loved him but she is coming to late. He has
burned up his town and dies alone in the snow.
