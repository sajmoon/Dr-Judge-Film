2001_February 10 

Based loosely on Thomas Hardy's novel &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; this is a
valiant recreation transposed from England to the cold mountains of early
California. A man sells his wife and daughter for a gold-mining claim. Years
later, when he is the local sheriff, his wife and daughter return. A
sub-plot documents the arrival of the railroad construction. This has all
the makings of a truly great movie but unfortunately is good without being
great. The first half is particularly disappointing - the camera fails to
linger where there are wonderful scenic shots of 
breathtaking beauty or dialogue that could have emotional impact. It lingers
over boring, inconsequential scenes. The movie also veers stomach-churningly
between episodes of gripping realism to episodes where it simply looks all
too obviously like actors on a set reciting their lines. Verging on
pretentiousness at times, The Claim still manages to pull through as a
worthwhile film, largely because it is worth seeing for the bits that work
well. <br /><br />The movie was shot in sub-zero Calgary, Canada, and considering the lengths
to which the film makers went to in order to achieve authenticity, it is sad
that the finished result was rather less than finished.
