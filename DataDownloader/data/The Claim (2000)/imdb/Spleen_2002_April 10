Michael Winterbottom's decision to construct the whole movie out of extreme
telephoto shots - some of which have a pane of focus so shallow you start to
wonder if it's really there at all - is more dogma than style.  It places a
heavy strain on the eyes which some viewers will mistake for tension in the
story.  (Michael Nyman's music, consisting of something like the &quot;endless
melody&quot; which Wagner threatened to write but thankfully never did, likewise
creates a tension which some viewers will mistakenly think belongs to the
story.  Actually, for once Nyman's music isn't that bad.)  You have to
admire the skill, and the art direction, like the choice of location, is
beyond praise, but there's NO REASON AT ALL to make as peer at every single
scene through a telescope, except perhaps that it's a shortcut (far too easy
a shortcut) to stylistic unity.<br /><br />It's surprising, towards the end, after all the cold, barely focused and
rather absent storytelling, to find that the film packs a punch, after all. 
It came as a shock when I realised I'd actually been watching something
GOOD.  We really had been transported to another place (the journey was just
a little slow); not having read Hardy's book, I found myself wondering how
he could possibly have placed the story in an English setting.<br /><br />I was also surprised to find myself touched.  Some sad things happen at the
end.  I won't say what they are, and a synopsis of the plot probably
wouldn't reveal what's sad about them, anyway.
