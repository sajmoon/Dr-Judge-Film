One of my favourite things about this fine film is that the characters
have European accents; too often films set in the American frontier of
the 19th Century have their characters speaking in unlikely modern
American accents. It adds greatly to the film's believability, as well
as reminding the viewer that these were people who left their
homelands, usually to escape extreme poverty, and started a new life in
what was (to the white man) unknown territory; this utter anonymity
helps explain the actions of some of the characters in the film. Indeed
the central theme, the cost of sacrificing what one has for a possible
better life, is an aspect of emigration itself; the poem &quot;Noreen B&aacute;n&quot;
recited by Hope Byrne recalls the tragedy of mass emigration from
Ireland after the Great Famine, so its impact on Dillon is multiplied.<br /><br />Great credit is also due to the actors, excellent performances all
round.
