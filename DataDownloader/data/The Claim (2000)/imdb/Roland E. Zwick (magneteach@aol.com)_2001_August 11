Although set in a remote Sierra Nevada mining town in 1867, `The Claim' is
really Thomas Hardy's classic novel, `The Mayor of Casterbridge' transported
to American soil.  The move is a good one.<br /><br />The story concerns a wealthy miner named Daniel Dillon who practically runs
the town of Kingdom Come as his own personal fiefdom.  One fateful day three
groups of people arrive into town:  some railroad surveyors who offer the
possibility that a train may soon be passing through the town, bringing with
it people, wealth and prosperity; some prostitutes who plan to open up shop
in this all-male community; and a sickly woman and her beautiful young
daughter, who, it turns out, are the wife and daughter that Dillon sold for
a bag of gold in his desperate youth &#150; a decision he has lived to rue ever
since.<br /><br />Given this multi-character canvas, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and director
Michael Winterbottom take an almost painterly approach, allowing the drama
to unfold at an unhurried pace, so that they can concentrate on the bleak
snowy winter setting which ends up playing as great a role in the drama as
the characters themselves.  The most compelling of these is Dillon, a figure
of almost tragic proportions, a man who seizes the chance to make amends for
his heinous sin, yet who discovers, all too late, that, for some sins, there
can be no redemption.  Peter Mullan provides a superbly understated
interpretation of a man whose acquisition of immense wealth and power only
mask the loneliness and guilt he feels inside.  Wes Bentley as the chief
railroad surveyor, Nastassja Kinski as Dillon's ailing wife, Sarah Polley as
their daughter and Milla Jovovich as Dillon's devoted mistress all turn in
outstanding performances.  Although none of these characters are afforded
the same richness and depth that Dillon is, they still create a fascinating
tapestry of conflicting dreams and emotions.  For the concept of `dreams' is
a core element of the story's pioneer theme.   Here are a group of rugged
individualists, all enduring great hardships on a wild outpost far away from
the soothing amenities of civilized life &#150; yet all dreaming of being a part
of the building of a burgeoning new nation, of which the makeshift towns and
railroad-building are truly indelible symbols. <br /><br />And, indeed, in many ways, it is the images &#150; of rugged mountains, of the
relentlessly falling snow, of a house being pulled by horses across a snowy
plain &#150; that stick with us most profoundly.  `The Claim' is a somber, moving
and fascinating glimpse into our pioneer past.  <br /><br />
