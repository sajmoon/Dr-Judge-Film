2001_January 8 

This film is amazingly beautiful and wonderfully done. Congrats to director
Michael Winterbottom and especially Milla Jovovich who is excellent.<br /><br />The cinematography will knock your socks off!<br /><br />I think this will be the sleeper of the 2000-2001 winter and will listen
for
it on Oscar nomination night.
