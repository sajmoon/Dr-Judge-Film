This is a rare British attempt at a Western, albeit an uncharacteristic
one about a small mining town clashing with the oncoming railroad: it&#39;s
reasonably well served by the stark cinematography, Michael Nyman&#39;s
dramatic underscoring and a surprisingly able cast (the most impressive
being Peter Mullan as the town leader with a secret past and Milla
Jovovich as the chanteuse who has hooked up with him).<br /><br />Given the director, the film strives for absolute realism (down to the
varying accents of the multi-national townspeople and the kind of
entertainment provided in the dingy saloon); this, coupled with its
relentless solemnity and a plot which isn&#39;t as engaging as it should be
- actually containing a good deal of padding, particularly its baffling
emphasis on the blossoming romance between a prospector and a
prostitute - results in a rather uneasy film, one that&#39;s not remembered
with affection! However, the tragic finale - with Mullan&#39;s dreams
literally going up in flames - is effectively handled.<br /><br />Curiously enough, watching THE CLAIM I was reminded of Nicolas Roeg&#39;s
similar EUREKA (1983) - which also revolved around a family undone by
the lust for gold - though it lacks that film&#39;s striking imagery (not
to mention its equally distinctive eccentricity).
