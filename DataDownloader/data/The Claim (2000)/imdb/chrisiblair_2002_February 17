....certainly the best I have seen in recent years.  This movie
did have a
few flaws, but the integral whole was overwhelmingly positive.  The
characters I found believable, the circumstances interesting, and the
location beautiful.  There are some very memorable moments such as (don't
worry - no spoilers) the scene in the cabin about 20 mins into the movie,
and the sequence later in the film where Dalglish is riding back to talk to
his superiors about the route for the railroad.<br /><br />Instead of the same old gunfight at the OK corral kind of western, this one
is set in what must have been a very exciting time &amp; place - the Sierra
Nevada Mtns in California in 1869 - when the Central Pacific Rail Road was
being carved through to join the west coast up with the rest of the
country.
The film has several threads, one of which follows a surveying party for
the CPRR.<br /><br />There were also many good &quot;slow&quot; scenes with subtle dialogue.  I thought
this was one of Nastassja Kinski's better roles, although it was a demure
one.  There was some vulgarity, but I thought it was functional &amp; showed
the
distasteful side of the Old West, and it was not constantly in my
face.<br /><br />I highly recommend for a mature audience.
