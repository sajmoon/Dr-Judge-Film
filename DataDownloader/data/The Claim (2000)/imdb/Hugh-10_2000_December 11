Another adaptation of a Thomas Hardy novel by Michael Winterbottom.  In
many
ways, this film is an anti-Western in the vein and tone of Altman's McCabe
and Mrs. Miller.  Though there is gorgeous location photography and
stunning
snowscapes, it never becomes just a pretty movie.  Unusual and complex
characters, a tragic story (that may be a little hard to follow) great
performances by all especially Peter Mullan, Sarah Polley and Wes Bentley.
A truly original film unlike any you will see this year.  Nice score by
Michael Nyman.  See it.
