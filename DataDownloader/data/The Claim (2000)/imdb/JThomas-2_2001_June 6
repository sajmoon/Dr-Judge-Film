This is a bloated pompous mess of a movie that looks really good and wants
to be good, but cannot be.  The editing is mostly to blame.  It jumps around
from time period to time period without much warning and then there are the
events in the movie that make little sense.  For example, why does a fully
furnished house moved into place by men and horses, not have broken dishes,
crockery, paintings on the floor, etc.?  Instead everything is perfect when
the actors step inside.  And why is a train circa 1930's running around in
1900 California?  And how on God's green Earth could someone be buried six
feet under when there is a good two feet of snow on the ground (anyone who
lives in a snowbound area knows this is impossible)?  Wes Bentley isn't so
much acting as just saying lines.  The one thing this movie had in its favor
is that none of the actors had straight teeth - and that would be fitting
for the era...
