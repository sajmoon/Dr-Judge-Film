`The Claim' is classified as a western but doesn't quite fit the profile.
There's a little bit of gunslinging but it's mostly a love story/human drama
set in the period immediately following the Civil War. As with most period
films, this one is an allegory of modern times. It has a lot to say about
how progress cannot be stopped. Those picking it out hoping to see a Western
may be disappointed.<br /><br />Normally a period film like this will try to throw in as many
beautiful
vistas and open country scenery as it can. Director Winterbottom works such
shots in, but only to establish a setting. He instead goes against
convention and decides to have the whole thing shot in hand-held. This style
is meant to make you feel like a bystander watching the events yourself.
It's not something you see often in period films, but it works well here.
The hand-held cinematography, engaging characters, sets, and costumes make
you feel very close to the events. <br /><br />I wish this film had gotten a wider theatrical release. I did get to watch
the letterboxed DVD version, but it's still nothing like watching it on the
big screen. Many less deserving films get very wide initial theatrical
releases. &quot;The Claim&quot; is truly a film that is meant to be watched in a movie
theater.<br /><br />Grade: A-
