Pure escapism. Just feel so validated that Entertainment Weekly's Owen
Gleiberman ranked this as one of the 10 best movies (any genre) of the
90's.
My favorite scene is when the movie's holy trinity: the past (Wooderson),
the present (Pink), and the future (Mitch) are all walking into the
Emporium
to Bob Dylan's Hurricane.
