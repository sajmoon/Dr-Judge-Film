Dazed and Confused is by far one of the greatest teen movies ever made. I
don`t think a teen film has ever been realistic as this one. There lots of
main characters in this film. 
Unlike most teen movies, Dazed and Confused has good film making behind it.
This film is definetly underrated and over-looked towards other teen films.
