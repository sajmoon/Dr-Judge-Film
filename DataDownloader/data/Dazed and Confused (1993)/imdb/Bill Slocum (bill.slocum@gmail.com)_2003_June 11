This is the film comedy that gave us Ben Affleck and &quot;That 70s Show,&quot; but
it's cool to like it anyway. Taking a deep-focus look at an 18-hour period
in a small Texas city just before the Bicentennial summer of 1976, &quot;Dazed
And Confused&quot; introduces us to a group of tangentially connected high
schoolers and junior high schoolers. Not much happens in this film. People
make pronouncements about how bored they are with everything and indulge
in
politically incorrect behavior (drugs, underage drinking, and [gasp]
full-contact high school initiation rites). Under the benevolent eye of
director Richard Linklater, no one gets hurt, and everyone has a
laugh.<br /><br />I like the film less for its tacked-on and suspect message of personal
freedom at whatever cost and more for the unhurried, character-driven
narrative. We meet a ton of people in this movie, not just the dozen or so
key players but some worthwhile detours like the Birkenstock-clad history
teacher whose polemic take on the Fourth of July would make Joan Baez
proud,
the assistant coach with the linebacker grannie and the creepily creeping
pair of shorts, and the out-of-it liquor store clerk who actually thinks
Mitch is 18 (&quot;Just remember to eat a green thing every day,&quot; he tells the
pregnant woman, who is by the way smoking.)<br /><br />This film is just oozing with period detail and a real sense of
&quot;being-there.&quot; That would be okay by itself, but watching the
multi-layered
main characters shoot the breeze and interact with one another makes it
all
worth it. I don't know that I feel I went to high school with these guys,
but I wish I had. They're more interesting than the crew I did graduate
with.<br /><br />I think I have a different favorite character every time. Parker Posey has
a
great rant at her freshman underlings during the initiation - &quot;Air
Raid!&quot; -
and little Mitch is quietly effective even if he does roll his eyes a
little
too much. But Matthew McConaughey rules in this one. He may have become
our
generation's Richard Gere, a too-good-looking guy with too many bad films
on
his resume, but this one is why people thought so much of him in the first
place. He's dead on funny, and totally in command, whether it's trying to
pick up girls half his age or itemizing his muscle car in a war of words
with the evil Clint.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing, especially if you're old enough to remember the
decade this was set in. And don't feel alone if you come away frm this
feeling like you missed out on a lot in high school. I did,
too.
