This has got to be one of the best movies I've EVER seen.  The acting is
incredible.  Actually, everything about this movie is incredible.  It
captures an era in time better then any movie I know of.  I have watched
this movie so many times I can't begin to count.  How many movies can you
watch more than 2 or 3 times and not be sick of?  I don't know why, but I
can't get sick of this movie.  The soundtrack is great, too.  Really gets
you in the mood.  I wish there were more movies like this.  And I can't
stand people out there who think it is a stupid 70s-pothead-drug movie...it
is so much more then that.  The characters in this movie are unforgettable.
Ok, I'm gonna stop now.  If you are in the movie for a GREAT movie, rent
this immediately.
