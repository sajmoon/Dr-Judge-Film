1999_July 19 

Having seen this film about 200 times (no lie) it has to be the funniest
High School/Stoner movie of all time...I am not in the business of watching
a film many times, but D&amp;C has something different...WATCH
CLOSELY...Wooderson(Matthew McConaughy) has to be the most delicately
formed
character in the whole film...portrayed by a wonderful actor, he has to be
the best loser ever in film...note his swagger, his tone of voice, his
firing of his finger(in the scene at the pool hall in slow mo)...we all
knew
this guy in one form or another throughout our lives.  You can sense this
is
how truly cool McConaughy really is (watch Ed TV you'll see it).  He is
quite charismatic.
Next...Jason London's performance of jock tires of the jock image...it hit
so close to home for me having known a couple of really talented athletes
that gave it up to shake the dummkopf image.
Slater typical stoner...Pickford typical guy who can make things happen(but
doesn't do it well enough &quot;Hey what can I say, it was beyond me&quot;)...this
movie is so real and yet so entertaining that anyone who hasn't seen it
should see it NOW.  Watch Adam Goldberg...typical dork who's had
enough...HILARIOUS!!!...look for the little things that make this film
great...it takes a couple of viewings mainly for the purpose of regaining
your composure enough to get the tears out of your eyes to keep watching. A
perfect ten regardless of the voters' results!!!
