All i can say is WOW! My friend has been telling me to see this movie for
awhile now. I finally rented it last week and watched it. Even though there
was really no point to the movie it was still highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is about a bunch of high school students on their last
day of school in 1976. <br /><br />All the characters are memorable and it's hard to forget every one of them.
I think most high school students can connect with the characters whether it
be 1976 or 2000. I know, personally, that each one of my friends (and
including myself) is each one of the characters. Of course I have a friend
who is identical to Pink, Simone, Michelle, Mike, Tony,
etc..<br /><br />All the actors in the movie were great but Rory Cochrane's character,
Slater, just stood out. Of course me being a fan of this fine actor, would
say something like this, but it is true. The doped-up stoner, Slater, is one
of the funniest and unforgetable characters of Dazed.<br /><br />Highly recommended movie for anyone regardless of age. This movie is not
your average PG-13 teenaged movies like Down To You, Drive Me Crazy, (or
anything containing Freddie Prinze Jr.). Because it's not your average PG-13
teenager movie, it's rated R for language and they smoke a lot of weed in
this movie.<br /><br />&quot;George Washington was in a cult, and the cult was into aliens
