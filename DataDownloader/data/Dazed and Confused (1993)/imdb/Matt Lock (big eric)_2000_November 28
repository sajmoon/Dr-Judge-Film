I came across this film one night as i was flicking through the TV
stations.
I was immediatly hooked. The script, music, camera-work and acting make
you
feel, by the end of the film, that you know all of the characters like
they
are your best friends. You want to find out what happens to the gang as
they
set out on their post-high school lives and you feel absolutely gutted
when
the film finishes because it feels like you've been watching real
life.
I would recommend this film to anyone, young or old, because the script
work
is so strong and the acting so real that anybody can watch this and
appreciate the time and work that has gone into it. It is my all time
favourite film!
