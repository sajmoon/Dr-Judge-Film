Everything about this movie is awesome.  The opening scene, while simple,
is
in my opinion the best way to open a movie like this.  Aerosmith, and a
hotrod slowly crusing the parking lot of a high school.  It makes me wish I
would have been a high schooler in the seventies instead of the nineties.
The story is great, and true.
