In 1976 I was a junior in high school. Except for the seniors chasing
freshman around town to beat them with a paddle (that was done in
college actually), this movie perfectly depicts the all-out partying
and rock-n-roll mood of the era. (The only other movie that captures
the feel of the 70&#39;s this well is Cameron Crowe&#39;s &quot;Almost Famous&quot;) This
movie portrays the jocks, the (pre-computer) intellectual geeks, the
babes, the jerks, and the shy underclassmen. Nothing before or after
compares with the 70&#39;s. Everyone who lived in those heady times knows
this with absolute certainty. Everyone else wishes they had experienced
that era of history, even though they would never admit it. But thirty
years later, what are we all still listening to? Zeppelin, Pink Floyd,
Tull, The Who - bands that take us back to that period. I also like
that Ben Affleck gets nailed. This movie launches the careers of
Matthew McConaughey, Parker Posey and Ukrainian uber-babe Milla
Jovovitch. It is incomprehensible that Ben Affleck made it bigger in
Hollywood than Jason London who demonstrates such a natural aptitude as
a leading man in this film. In short, the movie illustrates that it
didn&#39;t matter who you were or where the party happened to be, the 70&#39;s
was a state of mind.
