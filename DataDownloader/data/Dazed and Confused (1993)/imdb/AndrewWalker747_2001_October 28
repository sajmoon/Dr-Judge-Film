This is one of those movies that can be watched anytime with your friends. 
At a party, sleepover, getting drunk, or even by yourself this movie will
work.  The main reason why is that teenagers (like me and mostly anyone who
saw or should see this movie) can identify with it so much. <br /><br />Every high school social group is represented in this film.  There are the
cheerleaders (Jodi, Sharone, Darla, Simonne) the stoners(Slater,Pickford,Michelle)
the jocks (Benny, O'Bannion, Melvin, Dawson) the two freshman at their first
night partying (Mitch- maybe the only downside to the movie with his ratty
appearance, and Sabrina) the freshman getting their asses busted
(Carl,Tommy,Hersch)the losers (Cynthia,Tony,Mike) and then there is Randy
Floyd who is the best though-out character in the movie.  Thats because if
you noticed he blends in with all of these groups.  He was a football
player/stoner, loved by the cheerleaders, invites the freshman Mitch out,
and is friends with the losers.  Also another classic character was
Wooderson, the 30 year old hanging out with high schoolers.<br /><br />All in all, any teenager should see this movie to see an exact reflection of
their lives.  Like i said, every social group is present and accounted for,
and the characters portrayal of them is outstanding.
