Maltin says the characterizations take precedence over the storyline.
Correct.  This movie has no storyline, or plot, which would be fine for a
docu-drama, but its not that either.  Its just pointless.  I graduated
high-school in 1975 and recognized nothing here, except for the music.
Mindless teens race around in cars, smoking pot, drinking beer, whooping
it
up and fighting with each other.  Some people do identify with these type
of
scenes.  If you are one of those you may enjoy this.  If you are looking
for
a film with artistic merit, this ain't it.
