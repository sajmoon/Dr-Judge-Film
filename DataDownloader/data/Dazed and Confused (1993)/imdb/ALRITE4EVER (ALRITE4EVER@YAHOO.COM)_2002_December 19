This movie took place in 1976,when I was only 7yrs.old,but I can relate to
it.I had siblins &amp; couisons who were teenagers,and since I lived in a small
southern town as a teenager in the 1980's,I can still relate.Cruising the
strip,hanging out at the local gathering places,trying to fit in with the
older crowd.In the 80's I knew someone like wooderson-he was in his
thirties,but hung out with a younger crowd,he had a souped-up car,and was
always scoping the younger babes.And the girl who played Sabrina was
gorgeous.I would love to see what she looks like now,almost
10yrs.later,especially in a magazine like Maxim,Stuff,or
FHM!!!!!
