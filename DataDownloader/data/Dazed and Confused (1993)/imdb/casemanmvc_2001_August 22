I think that ever since &quot;The breakfast Club&quot; everybody wanted to make teen
comedies and this one is one of the best.This movie came out my first year
of high school and i didn't see it until my junior year and i loved it.
This
movie is about being Accepted and always being friends no matter what. I
suggest watching this with someone who went through the 70's. It's the best
way to watch it. overall teens and adults will love this
movie
