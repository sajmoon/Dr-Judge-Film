1999_June 27 

I first saw Dazed and Confused only a few months ago. I
liked it. I thought it was funny,and entertaining. The
movie is about a bunch of high school kids in the last day
of school in 1976. Nearly every one of them are dopers.
Some of them are mean. Others are cool. The movie just
shows this people drink,smoke pot,crash parties,and fight.
Normally I would need more from a movie that's just about
people getting high,and drunk. but since most of the 
characters are interesting it makes the drinking,and high
moments better than your adverge stoner movie. I give 
Dazed and Confused *** out of ****
