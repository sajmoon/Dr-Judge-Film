I really can't think of any other way to describe this movie than what
I've
already said. All the fantastic 70's pop psychology references (love the
Gilligans island thing), cute comedy moments (&quot;I wanna dance!&quot;) and the
awesome performance by Parker Posey as Daria, the typical High School
Bitch,
this film truely rocks. The only flaw being Mitch's facial expressions -
just watch it!! (where did they get that guy?!?)
