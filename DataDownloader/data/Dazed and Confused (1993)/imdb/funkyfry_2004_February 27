Just saw this movie again for the first time in a decade.... it is holding
up fairly well over time, despite the numerous imitations (TV and otherwise)
that this film (which is, itself, an imitation of Lucas' &quot;American
Grafitti&quot;) has inspired.  Millia Jovavich makes an early appearance, as do
several other future stars and would-be stars.  The story is a slice of life
type thing, which seems to come naturally to Linklater.  Unlike Lucas' film,
this one also focuses to some extent on female characters, and also doesn't
force us to reconcile our own experiences of adolescence with the picture of
a group of friends that happens to include one person from each social
group... in Linklater's 70s nostalgia trip, the losers definitely hang with
the losers and the jocks with the jocks.<br /><br />Funny, not overly sentimental, not particularly distinguished, but a good
film to laugh and enjoy an evening with.
