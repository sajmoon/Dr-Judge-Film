This movie is one of the biggest wastes of screen talent I have endured in a
very long time. No plot, very little humor, and even less
interest.<br /><br />Almost everyone gets into their roles with gusto, especially Matthew
McConaughey and Parker Posey. Sometimes they're fun to watch, but most of
the time you're just wondering what was being smoked when the script was
written. Was there a script? Was there even a point? Or was this just a
panegyric to 1976? If so, don't pretend there's a movie
there.<br /><br />There's too much dramatic irony - winking at us because of what the years
afterwards were like - and too little characterization to make the viewer
care about what happens to these people.
