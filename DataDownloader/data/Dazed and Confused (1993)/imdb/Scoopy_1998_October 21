A real movie about real people. You won't find any tight plotting. Well,
actually, you won't find any plotting at all.<br /><br />It is a slice of life ... one night. It is real and charming and
passionate.<br /><br />Look for a marvelous characterization by Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson,
the older guy who still hangs around with the high school kids to relive the
only time in his life when he felt successful. He is so real I wondered if
it was a guy I used to know who was the same way ... the hair, the speech,
the look in the eyes, he got it exactly right.<br /><br />Most of the film got it exactly right.
