I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored.  It takes me
back
to high school so effectively its scary.  The scary part is that I was in
high school in the late 80's and this movie still holds true.  This movie
proves that times don't change that much.   I most identify with Pink.
This
movie makes me wish I was in high school in the 70's.  I would have to say
this movie has the very best soundtrack compilation of any movie, ever.
Seriously.  It just rocks throughout.  I think I read that the soundtrack
has 30 tracks in all, all of wish will remind you how awesome the music of
the 70's was.  Drink a few beers, sit back and relive the best times of
your
youth...unless you were a complete prude.  Have some fun...
