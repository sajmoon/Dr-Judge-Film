Being a huge fan of the 70&#39;s, I really enjoyed this movie and the feel
it conveyed. It was just about a end of school party and so much more.
Watching it made me want to go back. The music and the fashion then
were the bomb; I listen to tons of 70&#39;s music, but the fashion isn&#39;t
viable today unfortunately. The feel of the movie is much more American
in spirit as this movie promotes freedom and is during a time of
rebellion concerning, beer, pot, fashion, music, and such and really
the characters seem much more mature and real than kids today are. 93&#39;
was a good time to make it, since it wasn&#39;t too long afterwards, but
not too close-aka, the 80&#39;s. I recommend it to everyone, because
everyone will laugh, contemplate, and enjoy this movie in someway.
Linklater totally chose an awesome decade to make a film about. This is
in my top ten favorite films list.
