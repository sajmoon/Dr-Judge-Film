I have to say &#x22;Dazed and Confused&#x22; is probably my favorite &#x27;coming of
age&#x27; movie besides the quintessential and BEST movie of this type,
&#x22;Stand By Me.&#x22; A hidden gem and highly underrated, this sleeper came
out and I remember all the stoners (including me) loved it for one
reason- it made us laugh our asses off while we were...having fun. But
revisiting it years later (and NOT stoned) I found a truly inspired and
humble tribute to life in the 1970&#x27;s. The cars were real, the music
rocked, the chicks were cool and the parties went all night long.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know what exactly it is about this movie that I love so much.
Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it never gets TOO serious, but it definitely
moves you. Maybe it&#x27;s the overall feel of the film; it&#x27;s got a good
heart. It&#x27;s funny, but never stupid. It&#x27;s patriotic, but it&#x27;s not in
your face about it. It&#x27;s just cool. And of course there&#x27;s Matthew
McConahey&#x27;s character; one of my favorites in any movie EVER.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend this movie. 10 out of 10, kids.
