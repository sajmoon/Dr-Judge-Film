2003_June 7 

This was a really funny movie, but not in an obvious way. It was good and
care-free, kinda light-hearted, and all about an era that I wish I'd been
able to see. A LOT of fresh talent's seen in this movie, including Jeremy
London, Adam Goldberg, Joey-Lawrence Adams, Cole Hauser, and Matthew
However-You-Spell-His-Last-Name (pretty funny that he got busted for playing
the bongos naked and stoned w/ another of the movie's young cast: I guess he
was doing research...) The funniest characters: Benny, Slater, Don, and
Wooderson. What made it possible for me to watch this with my parents:
drugs, booze, music, cars and clothes. I recommend it when fun is all you're
lookin for.
