2002_September 16 

I went to high school from 1979-1982... in a real way, mine was the tail end
of the generation portrayed in this film (just before MTV came on the scene
and everything transitioned into the 80's).  We wore a bit more modern
clothes and the hairstyles were a little different, and with some newer
music added to the mix (Journey, etc.), but in most ways it was the same...
this is really the way it was!  For 1 hr. 43 min. I sat transfixed (dazed,
confused, nearly stupified) in a state of pure nostalgia.  If this is what
the filmmakers intended with this movie, then kudos to them, they succeeded
in spades.  The film really brought back a time when everything seemed full
of possibilities and the future was wide open (I love that shot of the open
road at the end, it's the perfect ending the movie).<br /><br />I never quite got past the obvious fact that the actors were all early 90's
teenagers and imitating 70's teens (although I *almost* did, which is a real
compliment to everyone involved, especially the director).  I also agree
with other reviews that the &quot;hazing&quot; scenes don't fit too well (this seems
like more of a college thing to me than anything belonging in high school). <br /><br />I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and just plugged it into
the VCR on a slow sunday cuz I couldn't find anything else to watch, but
came out knowing this was a film I'd be seeing again... and again. 
Wonderful fun for anyone of that generation, especially those who were (or
aspired to be part of) the &quot;stoner&quot; crowd -- and an enjoyable peek into &quot;how
it was then&quot; for everyone else, too.  9/10.
