This entire movie took place on the last day of school in May of 1976 (when
I was 6 years old).  I love this movie.  There is not really a plot which is
the interesting thing.  It's just about these dudes and dudettes that hang
out.  Lots of interesting things happen....such as freshmen getting PADDLED
very hard by bullys.  In fact, Ben Affleck plays one of the senior bullies. 
There is some great stuff delivered by Matthew McGonehy.  I love it when he
says &quot;Say man, you got a joint?&quot;.  There are other terrific lines.   Don't
expect much out of Milla Jojovich.  She doesn't have any speaking roles. 
It's quite a shock considering how well she did in RESIDENT EVIL.  Go get
this movie NOW.  Watch it AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!
