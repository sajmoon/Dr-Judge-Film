I loved this movie it was amazing.......it brings back awesome memories
that i never had.....it makes me wish we were still in those
times....the best part is when they are throwing garbage cans.....and
in the beginning when Pickford says &quot; Slater-San &quot; that whole scene is
great.....I&#39;ve watched this movie like 20 times within a month of
owning it............ the casting was great there are some people from
movies like resident evil....rent.... and that new movie stay alive..
this move never gets old ( it cant )....even though i wasn&#39;t born in
the 1970&#39;s it still is a great movie and i get all the jokes.......THE
SUM IT ALL UP IT WAS A KICK ASS MOVIE!!!!!!!
