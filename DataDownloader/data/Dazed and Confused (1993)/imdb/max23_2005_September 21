2005_September 21 
I watched this movie recently because I read many times how good and
funny it is supposed to be and I'm also a fan of Richard Linklater's
work. So I expected a decent &quot;stoner&quot; movie with a good soundtrack and
some good jokes. However, all I got was the good soundtrack.<br /><br />I actually quit watching after 50 minutes as I was too bored of this
movie. Sure, there is a good soundtrack and this movie might even carry
some of that 1970s feeling (even if it didn't really catch me), but
there is just nothing happen! I'm not American so I have no idea about
these high school traditions and probably can't really identify with it
but anyway, the movie for me was quite boring. So I give it 3 out of 10
cause I still love Linklater and it was funny to see the
&quot;Ben-Affleck-thing&quot; with the worst haircut of its career.
