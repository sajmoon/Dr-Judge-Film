I really liked this movie, not one of my all time favorites, but oke. I
don't believe (but i couldn't really know) it's a 100% representation of
what it is like in high school, but in my (Dutch) experience of that age it
had surtenly a lot in commit (except the beating up of smaller kids, we
just
tipped their school bags...). It isn't always like that, but things like
smoking pot and molesting stuff are not a bad representation, as some may
think, it's just that not everyone participates in that(The people who
don't
have a very minor role in this movie). If it sets a bad example?; i think
some kids do that anyway, and i don't think they'll end up in jail, nor
should (and millitairy school.... please... don't get ' Spartanien about
it).
But maybe you shouldn't watch this movie as a good representation of what
it's like (in hs in the 70's), or if it sets a bad example, it's just good
fun. Don't make a big deal out of it, just enjoy. But for me it most
surtenly made me thing (and laugh) about the thing i did (and do). oke that
was it (and excuse me if some English (or a lot)was incorrect)
bye...
