This has to be one of the best teenager, high school flicks which tops
most of the many other films i have viewed. It depicts male and female
struggles with all the temptations that face youth and will continue
for generations to come. (maybe even worse). The beginning of the film
cautions the public that drug use is going to be viewed and it sure is
clearly displayed through out the entire picture. Beer drinking is
being digested like it is water on tap and bottoms up appears in more
ways than in bottles. The classic act is destroying mail boxes and also
a bowling ball being thrown into the back window of a car. One of the
teenagers talks himself into getting a six pack of beer from a liquor
store like it was taking candy from a baby. Lots of hot looking gals in
tight pants being zipped up with pliers in order to get their nice
forms skin tight. Very entertaining film and extremely realistic and
down to earth. All the actors gave outstanding performances. Enjoy
