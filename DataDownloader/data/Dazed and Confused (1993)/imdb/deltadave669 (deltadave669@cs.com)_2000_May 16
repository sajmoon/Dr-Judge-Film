This is the closest movie I've seen to high school life when I grew up.
Put
some AC/DC and Metallica shirts on the guys, some spandex on the girls,
more
Van Halen and Scorpions on the soundtrack, and this was high school for
me!<br /><br />The way the story is told is unconventional, but for what it is telling,
it
was perfect. Some people might get turned off by the lack of a singular,
cohesive plot, but that's their problem. This is a movie I can never get
enough of! Excellent soundtrack! The movie is worth watching just to hear
the music. Don't ever let anyone tell you that the seventies was devoid of
good music! See this movie, buy this movie! You will not be
disappointed!
