Dazed and Confused simply and delightfully tells the story of the last day
of school in a Texas town in 1976. It has no plot, but that isn't the point.
 Its point is to create a time and place that is chock full of memories, and
a lot of fun.  It gets every detail right.  It gets the bicentennial
celebration, the gas prices, the iron-on shirts, and even the hero's
nickname right.  It also get the hierarchy of the school correct as well. 
Nerds do not have pocket protectors, not all football players are ass holes,
and not everybody wants to have sex.  What we get is a funny, enjoyable,
richly observed day in the life of Texas high school teens.  The
performances are great (many of the young actors have become famous since
the movie's release), the dialogue is fully realized, and the soundtrack
could put a grin on even the dourest member of that generation.   What makes
this film wonderful is the appreciation of the moment that writer/director
Richard Linklater shows us.  We feel like we are watching life as it
actually happens, full of spontaneity, as opposed to the manufactured,
plot-driven events and dialogue that most movies give us.  That means we
care about these characters, and as importantly, we are there with them,
experiencing life on a hazy day in May where there might or might not be a
kegger.
