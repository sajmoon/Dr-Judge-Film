Growing up in a small town, there are obvious groups which form: the
slacker, the stoners, the loners, the booziers, the whores, the nerds, the
cool kids, and everyone who never fit into a category.  This is the movie
for all of them.  Set on the last day of school 1976, the teens (many of
whom have gone on to promising and fruitful careers: Ben Affleck, Adam
Goldberg, Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger just to name a few) show
how one day in your life can change everything.  Watching this movie,
whether you grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s or whenever, you can see how
life
really hasn't changed.  I'm sure we all wondered why our teenage years are
said to be the best.  This movie show why we loved growing up and why we
hated it.
