Looking at this cast, one might think this would be a great movie.  I gave
it a 5 just because it really has a great cast.  Adam Goldberg, who I
cannot
stand, really grated on me.  My favorite movie with him in it is Saving
Private Ryan.  Only because he gets stabbed really slow and dies a
horrible
death.  I expected a lot of laughs, but got few.  My sister was in the
class
of '76.  I don't seem to remember any of her friends acting like such
retards.  Matthew McCouneghy or whatever the hell his name is played
really
great white trash.  I knew lots of guys like him.  Losers that drop out of
school for a job that seems like hitting the lotto to a high school kid.
Then, they end up getting some skank pregnant only to find out they really
got a raw deal.  I had a couple buddies that we all thought were cool
because they had a muscle car and made $8 an hour.  Wow!  Other than that,
this movie really blew chunks.  I guess Ben Affleck was in it, but I don't
remember him at all.
