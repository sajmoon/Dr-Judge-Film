A most accurate portrayal of what actually happens to children when
they trundle off to school, if only parents paid attention to the
vicissitudes the real ugliness that can be growing-up in America,
especially as this community allows for the bullying of its younger
children.<br /><br />All of societies members are represented: the jocks, the rah rahs, the
intellectuals, the druggies, drunkards, cretins, all the people you
grow up with and then must work with on a daily basis as an adult. Yes,
here they all are, only shown on the cusp of adulthood, being equal
parts engaging, and cruel. <br /><br />The movie as well reflects on just how prevalent drugs are in modern
America, and how the typical user is not always only whom you most
likely suspect. Drugs being a are far more egalitarian an affair than
most people will admit to themselves.<br /><br />The beautiful summer day and evening are integral to the story, how
when one is young, there is nothing more desired than to be &quot;out,&quot; out,
anywhere, just simply as long as it is &quot;Out!&quot; You know, that time when
the air is sweet, warm, and the night simply teeming with potential and
portent! And so it goes, the torment, the first kiss, running from the
Neanderthals with paddles! Of which this, the paddelings are a large
part of the film, central to the story. A tale of how, those becoming
Seniors are allowed by this community to menace the freshmen with
specially made wooden paddles (Made in shop class no less!) really
scary stuff if you were a young man entering into this crazy milieu!<br /><br />What happens to ones dreams? Is what we do ever meaningful, truly? At
many levels this film attempts to answer these questions in a manner
which as previously stated as with real life equal parts joy, and pain.
