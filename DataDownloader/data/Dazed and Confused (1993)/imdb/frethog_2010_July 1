2010_July 1 
I graduated in &#x27;78 near Seattle and was surprised how authentic the
depiction of that time was. We didn&#x27;t experience nearly the level of
hazing but the characters and the parties and the atmosphere was
perfect.<br /><br />I was a head, who used to be a jock, so I hung around with both social
crowds. The football guys got stoned just like the rest of us...they
just wanted it to be a secret.<br /><br />The community club was significant because I ruled at Foosball at the
time.<br /><br />Except for the dominant hazing plot, this movie was incredibly
accurate.
