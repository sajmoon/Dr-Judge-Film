Dazed and confused is an excellent film. The quality is mainly in the
content of characters, atmosphere, and soundtrack. I've watched this feature
over and over again on DVD. Being able to relate to this film is what helps
it to score at the top of my list. It's a good reminder as to how simple
life can be. It also reminds you to just keep livin'. L-I-V-I-N!<br /><br />
