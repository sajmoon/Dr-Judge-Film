this movie has one of the best soundtracks ever.all of the tracks are
memorable and suit the tone of the picture.it features a good young cast
before they were famous and the movie maintains interest even though it is
seemingly about nothing. It simply follows the students of an American
high
school as they party,do drugs,drive around,fight and go through their high
school traditions on the last day of school.Set in the 1970s, this film is
funny, occasionally insightful, sometimes tragic(Matthew McConaughey's
character)and always enjoyable. i really liked this movie, and would
recommend it to most.this film is especially for high school students. its
better than most high school based films, particularly the modern gross
out
faze we are in. an excellent film
