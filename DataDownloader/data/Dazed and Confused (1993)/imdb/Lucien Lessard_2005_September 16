In the last day of school back in 1976, the film follows a varied group
of Suburban Teens in Texas.<br /><br />Written and Directed by Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, School of
Rock, Waking Life) made an absolutely entertaining comedy set in the
mid 70's. This is one of the finest coming of age films since George
Lucas' American Graffiti. Which &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;American
Graffiti&quot; would make an interesting double bill. The film has an
strong-then young cast like:Jason London, Wiley Wiggins, Sasha Jenson,
Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, Marissa Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Anthony
Rapp, Cole Hauser, Matthew McConaughey, Oscar-Winner:Ben Affleck,
Parkey Posey, Joey Lauren Adams, Nicky Katt and more. This film has
terrific characterization and a great soundtrack. This is a diverting
and refreshingly unsentimental film. Don't miss this. Look fast for
Oscar-Winner:Ren&eacute;e Zellweger. (**** &frac12;/*****).
