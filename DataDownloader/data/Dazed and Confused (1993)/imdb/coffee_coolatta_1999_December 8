1999_December 8 

One of the best movies ever made to reenact the 70's. This movie shows
what
it was like to be a stoner--the fun! I've seen this movie so many times
and
every time it's still funny! The best party movie ever-a total stoner
movie!! I recommend this movie to anyone that has lived in the 70's or has
wanted to live in the 70's. PLEASE GO AND RENT IT!
