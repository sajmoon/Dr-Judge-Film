Watching this film recently made me think that maybe I missed out on
something in high school. Out of college for the past few years, my
high school days, although more recent than not, now seem like a total
blah of status quo mundaneness. Especially in comparison to the
situations in this film. Dazed and Confused gave me a chance to relive
those years - moments - vicariously through characters that had some
sense of purpose and wide eyed excitement at even the most petty
situations. The acting was all around realistic and entertaining. The
directing and writing - was as usual - of high standard from the
purveyor of casual (waking?) life, Richard Linklater. Highly
recommended.
