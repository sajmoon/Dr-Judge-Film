1998_October 12 

This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made.  I first saw
it when it came out on video, and felt compelled to buy my own copy right
away.  Although it seems amazingly simple at first, I pick up something new
every time I watch it. Incredibly funny and totally true to life (although
the people in the film remind me more of people I go to college with than
those I went to high school with), it only gets better with each viewing.
Highly recommended!!!!!
