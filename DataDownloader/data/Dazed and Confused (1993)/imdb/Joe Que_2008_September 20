I was born in 1975 so I sort of understand that people like this film
as a travel back in time, but as a story, it sucks. The fact is: there
is no story. None whatsoever. Apart from the beating of the
freshmen(which I&#39;ve never experienced), I&#39;ve been to better and more
interesting parties than the one in this film, and I&#39;ve never thought
that those parties where film material. Style over substance all the
way. The best thing about is the music, but I find it hard to believe
that in 1976, they only played songs that were later to become
classics. I guess they also played songs that were forgotten as well.<br /><br />And it is not a comedy.
