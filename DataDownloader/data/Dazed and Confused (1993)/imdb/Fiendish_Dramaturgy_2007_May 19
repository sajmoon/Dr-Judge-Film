I hate to admit it, but this is probably the best portrayal of the end
of the Disco-just-pre-Reagan era. This is pure Americana, depicting
basically everything our culture was around that time, right down to
the perfect period look of the clothes, hair styles, lingo, catch
phrases, and attitudes.<br /><br />Even though this is quite realistic, for me, there was little that was
nostalgic about it. The performances were adequate, but nothing
inspired, and the dialog delivery was only close to natural. However,
the soundtrack is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />It should be watched at least once, though it is NOT a part of my
collection. this is one of those movies that...once you&#39;ve seen it,
you&#39;ve seen it.<br /><br />It rates a 7.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
