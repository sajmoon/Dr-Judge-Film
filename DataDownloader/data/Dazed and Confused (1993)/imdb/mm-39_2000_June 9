   I love this film about the last day of school.  This film is too
realistic for the writer to just make it up.  Sure some of the stuff could
be spiced up and some of the character could be merged, but the comments and
events remind me of a good story I heared form some friends while we go
camping.
   The freshie day, and the high school jerk etc make this story one of the
best.  It is directed so well you get the feel you where there, and the
script make one under stand what's in the minds of these people.  I bet the
writer was the chacater Mike in the movie, just call it a wild guess, but it
makes sence.
   I will not ruin the story, but if you love pranks, funny coments, and
crazy people you gotta see this one.
