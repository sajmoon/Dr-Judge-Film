1999_June 12 

Richard Linklater has presented me with a life to live for, living in the
seventies listening to Bobby D, Sweet and being friends with such funksters
as Rory Cochrane, Wiley Wiggins and Parker Posey. But, alas here I am in
the
non-committal 90's, I thank Bob for this movie, and the glimpse of life it
has given me! Dazed and Confused - seeing it is the prerequisite to being
cool!<br /><br />
