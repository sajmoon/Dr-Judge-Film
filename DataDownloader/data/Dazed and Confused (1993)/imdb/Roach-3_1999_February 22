1999_February 22 

Lets get straight to it.  Dazed and Confused was the best movie ever made to
display the 70's.  The realistic replica of everything made it even more
better.  Now I Know that there were screw ups but still the movie sends out a
message of how people have a good time and how people in athority try to
control us but in a small way never do.  Another thing is that this movie
gave you that feeling of an adventure when the only thing that really
happened was people riding around and hanging out. Well any way I give
this movie 2 thumbs up for its story and well thought out plot
line.
