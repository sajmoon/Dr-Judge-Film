It is 1976. In small town USA the stoners, the jocks and the wannabe's
are going about their life of doing very little beyond hanging out,
listening to rock music and playing cruel games.<br /><br />This is a wonderful example of what you can do with next to nothing, No
budget, no stars and very little in the way of a plot - and yet it
really entertains and is almost on a par with American Graffiti. A B
movie update of it maybe?<br /><br />(There are cruising and &quot;buying booze&quot; scenes that almost seem a
tribute to the Francis Ford Copolla classic.)<br /><br />What is there to do in this Southern Nowhere: Drugs (and more drugs),
house/field parties, smashing things up, getting alcohol underage,
cruising in beat up cars and making out with girls. Some of which are
rather young for that sort of thing.<br /><br />Writer/director Richard Linklater has obviously been there and done it
all. He keeps it going around in small circles - swapping from
character to character to character - like a mosquito that is always
looking for fresh blood to suck.<br /><br />Interesting to see a younger Matthew McConaughey playing an older guy
who hangs with the teens because they seem to have something. A long
haired Ben Afflick plays a bully who gets his comeuppance in the end.
Model Milla Jovovich hangs around the edges looking good and strumming
a guitar. Otherwise it is unknowns that stayed that way.<br /><br />If you can imagine that the USA was a small place (like Portugal, for
example) then this would be the kind of film they would make all the
time. They would have no choice. As we all know it is not - more's the
pity.
