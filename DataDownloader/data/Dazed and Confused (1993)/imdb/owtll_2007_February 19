I graduated from high school in 1973 and this movie hits the nail right
on the head it is exactly like it was when i was in school.I loved it
we used to have party&#39;s just like that out in fields and woods and
county parks.I am from Michigan but it was very similar to the films
location in Texas.I don&#39;t remember the initiations being such a big
deal at my school although there were some but the rest of it was
pretty close to what it as like at the time.The soundtrack was great I
seen most of those groups in concert in the 70&#39;s in Flint,Mi.I have
watched the movie several times and so far haven&#39;t got tired of it .I
would recommend it to any one around that age and I think they would be
able to relate to it.
