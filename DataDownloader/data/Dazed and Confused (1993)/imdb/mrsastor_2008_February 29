I must concur with the other reviewers who have commented on the eerie
accuracy of this film. I too attended high school in Texas in the
1970&#39;s, and this film is so flawless in recreating this time and place
it lends the impression you were being documented without your
knowledge. If you are of an age and background that permits you to
relate to Dazed &amp; Confused on this level, it will give you an unusual
affinity for the film. This is exactly how we dressed and wore our
hair, those are the cars we drove, the music we loved, that looks
exactly like my high school (with only slight variations in paint
colors), those seemed to be my teachers, and all of these people were
the people I knew then. There is no question but that the author of
this piece had to have been one of us.<br /><br />As someone who was there, I hope I can clear up or offer some insight
into a few of the points people have raised about the film. The drug
use; well, it was the 70&#39;s. In my high school, really hardcore drugs
such as heroin were virtually unknown, we talked about it but never saw
it, but both marijuana and LSD were as common and available as sand in
your shoes. My generation had a very permissive attitude toward these
substances. My own clique would never have had the brass ones required
to actually partake on campus, as getting caught would not have meant a
detention but a trip to jail; on the other hand it was not infrequent
to find us stoned in class. But we did leave campus to blow a joint,
absolutely, (usually in either the home of one of us who lived nearby
or a van that belonged to another of our group, parking at the shopping
center down the street). In D&amp;C we see Slater and some of his friends
smoking weed right in the schoolyard, that didn&#39;t happen in my school.
There wasn&#39;t a single teacher at my high school who would not have
immediately recognized the odor of marijuana and sought out the source.
With the clarity of thirty years hindsight, I remain of the opinion
that we frankly had a healthier attitude on this subject than do
so-called role models of today. Bad drug problems are bad drug
problems, but the recreational use of marijuana is substantially less
detrimental than either alcohol or tobacco, which both get a free pass
because they&#39;re legal. Marijuana also failed to serve as a &quot;gateway&quot;
drug in our clique, none of us were led by it into harsher substances.
I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not in high school today.<br /><br />One point of particular discussion I have noticed here on D&amp;C&#39;s IMDb
page is the movie&#39;s rather brutal depiction of hazing, &quot;busting the
freshmen&quot;. Several have reported that this did not occur at their
school. You were lucky, and be glad of it. I attended high school in
Dallas in the 1970&#39;s and this absolutely was a part of our life. I,
like all girls, was spared the brutal whippings that Mitch and his
friends have inflicted upon them by the seniors, but it absolutely
happened to incoming freshmen boys and was generally sanctioned, or at
least overlooked, by the adults in charge. For the record, YES IT IS
ASSUALT AND BATTERY. Dang! What else do you call violently beating
someone with a board until they cry? Battery, plain and simple.
Outrageous, mean spirited and cruel, and frankly the homoerotic
ass-fixated nature of this hazing paints a far more unflattering
psychological portrait of those dealing out the punishment than of
those receiving it. As girls we were at least not physically assaulted,
but we did undergo some nasty initiation rituals, but usually only
those of us trying to get into an organized club, not just all of us en
masse simply because of our age (this is also depicted quite accurately
in the film, what those poor girls endure from that bitch to get on the
cheerleading squad, God love &#39;em). And it is likewise plainly obvious
in the film just as it was in real life, the senior boys learned this
bizarre monkey-like behavior from those bastions of simian progress,
their &quot;coaches&quot;, roles universally filled by academic failures who
represent the Wooderson&#39;s of the future.<br /><br />As disturbing as the hazing is, it belongs in the film because it was
there, it was real, it was a part of our lives in that time and place,
and I felt a delicious satisfaction when that one kid&#39;s mom met
O&#39;Bannion at the front porch cocking a shotgun. &quot;I don&#39;t think so,
creep!&quot; You go girl! As both Mitch and Sabrina deal with the initiation
rituals in a manner that is respected by their older peers and grants
them access to the cool clique, it is too intrinsic to the storyline to
be removed or whitewashed. I might add this is the only movie I have
ever seen that captures this.<br /><br />In summation, this is a movie directed at a rather specific audience.
My friends who are of dramatically different age or grew up in a
different part of the country do not generally relate to this movie nor
enjoy it on the same level, although they often find it entertaining.
But if you, like the filmmaker, were a Texas high school student in
those amazingly permissive 1970&#39;s, and didn&#39;t particularly hate your
life at the time, I think you&#39;ll absolutely love it. Highly
recommended.
