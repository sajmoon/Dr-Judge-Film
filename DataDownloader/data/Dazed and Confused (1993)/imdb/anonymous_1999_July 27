1999_July 27 

Going to school in the 70's was a blast, so to speak and this movie really
hits the mark. But more to the point this movie
can make you cry, laugh, and think-and isn't that what a
good
movie should do? The Washington Post says this is one of the greatest
movies
ever made! If most viewers don't get it, so what. I thank the
director/writer for giving us, in-the-know a treasure that we will enjoy
for
the rest of our lives.
