1999_January 17 

i can't tell you how great this movie is...but man...it is...it is one of my
favorite movies...and the music is great!!!!! plus this movie is
realistic...except from the fact that everybody trashes the hallway because
my parents said that no teen in that era ever did that. but besides that
slighly misdemenour this is an instant classic for years &amp; years &amp; years to
come<br /><br />4 stars out of 4 stars
