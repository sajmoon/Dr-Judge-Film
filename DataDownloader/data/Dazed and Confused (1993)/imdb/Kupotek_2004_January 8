This is one of those  rare gems that feel like a autobiography, where time
and love and great friends collaborate to weave a wonderful and human
feeling story about a special time in history.<br /><br />I would love to find out where that egg chair comes from in the bedroom of
one of the kids near the beginning of the film.  Unfortunately such a time
piece treasure might  have to be rebuilt as a replica.  The egg shape on
a
stand with the plush black lining is so 1970's, one truly feels a part of
the times.<br /><br />
