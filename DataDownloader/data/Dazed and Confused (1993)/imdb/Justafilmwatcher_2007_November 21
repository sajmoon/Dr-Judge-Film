It&#39;s rare that I don&#39;t even get through a film. &#39;Dazed and Confused&#39; is
just one of two (the other being &#39;Fast Sofa&#39;.) For the record, I gave
myself THREE ATTEMPTS to get into this picture, and I failed each time.<br /><br />I couldn&#39;t see the point of this film. Having grown up and been in
school in 1976, none of the character representations even seemed
familiar. I&#39;m sure plenty of teens smoked dope, drank, rated
&#39;Gilligan&#39;s Island&#39; and fooled around, but that&#39;s not ALL they did.
Even the costumes are just phony 1990s nostalgic idealizations of the
mid-1970s.<br /><br />The filmmaker could stand a lesson on how to avoid reduced characters.
Awkward and thin representation of personality stereotypes is not
conducive to making a strong film. (Coincidentally, I believe it was
the young &#39;filmmakers&#39; of the 90s who ushered us into the era of
diluted screen writing. One might call it: &quot;anything I do is good &#39;cuz
*I* did it.&quot;) Also, the filming style is poor: colours are washed out,
the lighting is wan, and the sound is thin.<br /><br />I can&#39;t recommend this film to anyone as I found it unwatchable. It&#39;s
not even worth a rainy Saturday afternoon (even with a hangover).
&#39;Dazed and Confused&#39; is just another one of those vanity projects which
make you question why a production company would finance it.
