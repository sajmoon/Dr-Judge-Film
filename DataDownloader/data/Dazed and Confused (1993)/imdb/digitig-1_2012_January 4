2012_January 4 
The gang of us watching this got bored and drifted off one by one. I&#x27;m
of the generation portrayed in the film (those who wandered were
younger) and I stuck it out, although I wandered out to get a beer,
checked my email, stuff like that to keep myself amused. The film was
nothing but a boring sequence of humdrum and humourless episodes
happening to uninteresting and unsympathetic characters.<br /><br />I thought comedies were supposed to be funny? It didn&#x27;t raise a laugh
-- not even a single smile -- from any of us.<br /><br />I give it two stars for the soundtrack only; the rest deserves none at
all.
