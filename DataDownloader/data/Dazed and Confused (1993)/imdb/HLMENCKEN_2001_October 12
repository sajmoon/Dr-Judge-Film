2001_October 12 

In my memories of the seventies, I can't seem to recall all of the pot
smoking and paddling of freshmen that make up major elements of this
movie.
Yet, this last day (and night and morning) of school film with its
ensemble
cast is a wonderful take on life 25 years ago.  There were many great
performances by many great actors and actresses, but I can't remember
their
names off hand. (One of them later appeared in EDTV and another one made a
movie with Robin Williams and Matt Damon and yet another one was done away
with in Scream 3). The guy from EDTV (Matthew Something) has a haircut
just
like I did in high school, so I can attest that this movie is trying to be
realistic.  The pants are something else. Back in my day, we didn't dare
wear anything like that.<br /><br />Hilarious dialogue such as the part about George and Martha Washington and
their hemp growing and smoking habits run through the movie. Richard
Linklater, who did a great movie called Slackers, seems to have a thing
for
American presidents, what with the earlier bit about the nerd who had the
dream about a woman who looked like Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure Nixon was
mentioned in this movie too, but I can't think of the reference now.<br /><br />There are some parts of the movie that are a bit slow, but the characters
are drawn pretty well.  Some times it is a bit confusing and dazing to
keep
track of who is who; hence: the title. Another actor named Wiley Wiggins
(I
do remember his name) really does a great job at playing one of the
freshmen
who gets to hang out with the seniors. Extremely amusing scene when he
buys
beer from a Jamie Cromwell like store clerk.  The football coaches are
right
out of North Dallas Forty.<br /><br />At any rate, this movie is well worth renting or even buying. I think I've
seen it five or six times.  It's like one of those movies you want to see
over and over but don't really know why.  It's sort of a middle ground
between a gabfest like The Last Days of Disco and American Graffiti.  The
final scene, as the group goes off to buy Aerosmith tickets, really must
be
analyzed and thought about carefully. Very very deep. Later,
dude.<br /><br />
