Richard Linklater's Dazed &amp; Confused is like a groovy, rhythmic mixed
tape which reminds you of teenage angst but will still have you moving
to the beat. A story about losers - some of whom smart, some of whom
stoned and some just hanging around with nothing better to do.<br /><br />When I saw Larry Clark's Kids (1995) I watched with horrible
recognition. It was a depressing experience which epitomised the
wasteful energy of urban youth in a profoundly abject sense. Most
people hated it. Some admired it. Dazed &amp; Confused works better because
although we're looking at slackers, losers, potheads and wasted talents
it's told with such verve and ironic humour that you won't care. We
look back on our teenage years with fond nostalgia , and try to block
out the pain. This film encapsulates the banality of following the
crowd. Young Mitch - who is now a freshman - is being dragged through
the painstaking initiation process imposed on him by the senior
graduates. Later on in the film he follows them around with
apprehensive adoration, buying them beers and copying their
recklessness. Does he achieve adulation from them? Well, sort of.<br /><br />There are roles for such later stars as Matthew McConaughey, playing a
twenty something stoner who just keeps with the senior crowd because
he'll never be 17 again. The funniest and most ironic line in the film
is &quot;I love these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the
same age.&quot; A man with nowhere to go, and nothing to show for. Ben
Affleck plays a sociopath who's only source of solace appears to be
whacking the hell out of freshman with paddles. The only characters who
appear to have a vaguely non-gregarious attitude (Goldberg, Ribisi,
Repp) are ridiculed for it. And THEY go to the party too!<br /><br />A great soundtrack, another comparison to American Graffiti, to which
the film owes a lot, this is still one of Linklater's best. An
intelligent film with enough mix of stupidity and irony to appeal to
anyone.
