What could be said about this movie that isn't true? Everything from
the obscene reality of the hazing seniors to the overwhelming emphasis
of nothing but the sucess of 'next year's football team'. Growing up
in South Texas, the first time I saw this movie was a few weeks after
getting initiated. It was an experience I shudder to remember,
however, it was a part of growin' up. It was almost like a snap shot
into my freshman year...but I didn't touch my nose when frustrated
thirty-seven times within an hour and 40 minutes (like our friend
Wiley Wiggins, a.k.a. Mitch Kramer). Other than the nose grabbing, the
acting throughout the movie was superb, also with the depth that each
of the characters was given. However, I think that there are two main
unaccredited stars in the movie: the music and the cars. I'm sure that
the crew had a hard time collecting the rare beauties in mint
condition for the movie, much less securing permission from the owners
to use them (nothing'll p*** off the owner of a 1970 SS Chevelle
LS-7/454 more than scratching it). The music was introduced at all the
right times too, it seemed to flow very well through the movie,
especially at key moments, for example, when Hirshfelder and friends
were snuck up on by O'Bannion and friends with Black Sabbath's
&quot;Paranoid&quot; playing quietly, then roaring at 11, but most importantly,
&quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; at the end of the movie when the party's over and
Mitch's innocence is long gone. I'd give it a 9...but the reality of
it gives it a 10.<br /><br />D'ryan
