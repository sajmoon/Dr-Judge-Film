2004_July 10 

I'm watching this film for the probably 10th time as i'm writing this
review and i'm still absolutely in love with it. Growing up means
growing confused, disguised and most directly experienced as boredom;
especially in American suburbia or, to be more precise: in film
versions of suburban life. The boredom in Linklater's best film and the
lack of plot on the surface level both add up to something that is far
more interesting than it may appear to be. Adolescence has never been
(and probably will never again be) portrayed with so much love and
precision. And the fact that even a 24-year-old European like myself
finds himself, or rather his younger self, in this film over and over
again proves that Linklater's film is nothing less than a portrayal of
universal truths of the teenage soul.
