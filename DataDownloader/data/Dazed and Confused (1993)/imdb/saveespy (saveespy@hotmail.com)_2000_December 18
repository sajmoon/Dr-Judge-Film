This movie ROCKS! I still remember the first time I saw it, a full house
cinema on a Friday night. Phenommenal night! What &quot;Dazed&quot; shows are
teenagers being teenagers. It could be any time, anywhere. Besides, it is
still painfully funny. If you ever get the chance, play the &quot;Dazed &amp;
Confused&quot; drinking/smoking game. The rules are simple; match all cast
members drink for drink and smoke for smoke. I think I passed out about
three quarters of the way through when I did it. Another thing. Next time
you see &quot;Dazed&quot;, listen to some of the background dialogue. The film was
right, you can't handle one hour drum solos on strong acid,
man!<br /><br />Check you later!!!! (In the immortal words of one Mr Slater)
