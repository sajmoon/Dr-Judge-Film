1999_November 13 

Going in to this movie I expected a sort of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; American-style.
That is not what you get. Expect a &quot;Stand By Me&quot; for highschool seniors.<br /><br />Like &quot;Stand By Me&quot; this movie does not disappoint. There is not much plot,
it's about people experiencing stuff and facing their future. The way the
filmmakers bring it is excellent, it's like your coming along on this very
cool and weird first day of summer. The young kids are getting their first
kiss and joint, the older kids are thinking about their future and
reminiscing their highschool days.<br /><br />All the kids are on the brink of something; leaving something behind and
taking a step forwards. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; tells no story, it simply shows
us a day in the life of teenagers in the seventies. And it's Far
Out!
