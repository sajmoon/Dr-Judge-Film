1999_June 6 

Everything about this absolute gem of a movie makes me feel very good. I
feel that my perspective on the last half of the 20th Century would be far
weaker if not for Richard Linklater's masterpiece on being young in the
1970s. The number of times that I have &quot;watched this movie with a bud&quot; and
had an absolute blast where otherwise I would have been bored and
depressed
about being stuck in the 90s is astonishing. I am downright thankful to
everyone involved in Dazed and Confused for creating such a worthwhile
window into one of the most amazing and underrated times in our history.
From witnessing them, I already realize just how much the shameful 1980s
and
1990s have sucked ass, but seeing this homage to the wonderful 1970s
hammers
the point in unmistakably. How anyone could feel any other way about this
is
completely unimaginable to me. Dazed and Confused has had an impact on my
life like no other movie ever could, and it has been and will continue to
be
nothing but a positive factor in my life. Linklater is a genius. Dazed and
Confused is as close to a perfect production as you are going to find.
People owe it to themselves not only to see this movie, but to get to know
it. And while you're at it, reevaluate some things in your life and open
your eyes to how things should be, something that has long been lost in
our
society. Look, we need some alcohol! Samyl Pantry Parkloiter
