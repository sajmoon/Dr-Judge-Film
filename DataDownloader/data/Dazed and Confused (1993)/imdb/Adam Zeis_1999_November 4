1999_November 4 

We've all been through the last day of high school, we know what it was
like
- slacking through class and partying all night.  This movie summarizes the
last day of junior year for everyone.  It brings you back to that one night
when everyone was looking for a good time.  Somehow this movie made it's
way
to the top of my favorite movie list.  It's not a classic to most people,
but it's a legend in my book.  I feel like I could recite the entire film
if
asked too ... I dedicated my soul to Dazed and Confused .. what a wonderful
piece of work ...<br /><br />Check out The Emporium/
