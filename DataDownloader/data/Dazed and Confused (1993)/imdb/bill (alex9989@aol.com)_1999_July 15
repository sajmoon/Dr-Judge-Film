&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is an outstanding and stunningly vivid period piece.
Yet, it lacks all the stuffiness and/or outdated qualities of a period
piece.  This film is fascinating, hilarious, fun and truly honest.  This
is
easily a film that a viewer can relate too! (so long as a viewer can look
past the bell bottoms and bushes).<br /><br />Director Linklater has filled this great comedy with great actors (Ben
Affleck, Parker Posey, Jason London and Matthew McConaughey), a realistic
script that does not depend on melodrama or dramatic points and one of the
best soundtracks to be found anywhere.<br /><br />If this film doesn't make a viewer instantly nostalgic for the freedoms,
pains, ambitions and spirits of youth, than you're probably dead!  This
really is a great accomplishment and a pleasure to view
repeatedly!
