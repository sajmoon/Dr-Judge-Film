There&#x27;s only three aspects of this film that make it worth anything: 1)
The visuals are almost entirely dead-on for 1976. 2) The dialog is
almost entirely correct. 3) The music is correct for the period. This
is the only reason I give it two stars.<br /><br />After that, it&#x27;s an entire waste of time. It&#x27;s not even funny. All
there is is people being stupid, drinking, smoking, cruelty for its own
sake, and encouraging other younger people to do the same. There&#x27;s
really no plot, character development, or reason to empathize with most
of the characters. I kept hoping to see someone say or do something
truly thoughtful or worthwhile, but it never happened. If you want to
see a good movie about 1976, watch a movie from around that time
period, not this one.
