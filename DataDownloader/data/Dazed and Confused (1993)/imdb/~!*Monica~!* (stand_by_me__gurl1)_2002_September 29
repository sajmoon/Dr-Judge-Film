&quot;Hey you guys, I know this great movie we can watch, it's called
Dazed and Confused.  It's one of my favorites.  It's supposed to
take place in the 70's.&quot;  My friend squealed while rushing to get the
video case.  'Oh great' I thought.  Another movie that is trying to
impersonate the 70's.  Little did I know that after watching the
movie, that I was going to talk about how great it was for more than
2 days.  This movie truly is a nostalgic treat.  True, I wasnt born in
the 70's, so I dont know what it was like.  But I have heard from a
lot of adults that this movie brings back bitter-sweet memories of
their past.  Who knew that the last day of school before summer,
could be THAT FUN!!!  Parties, drugs, Beats, sweet revenge,
football, school, and a couple of surprises, are all packed in this
wonderful movie.  I suggest that the next time you want to rent a
movie that is full of hot guys in relatively tight pants, stoners,
partiers, girls galore, nerds, rebels, guns etc.  Rent 'Dazed and
Confused.'  It truly is one of a kind.  And it definitely makes you
want to PARTY!!!
