It's my opinion to vote this 'movie' as excellent, because of the state
I was in, while watching it. You can feel like you're 15,16 or 17
again. And all your memories, thoughts,dreams and expectations from
this time can suddenly come back to your mind, while you're
surprisingly realizing that you've already started to cry. You remember
the freshest breath of air,the mysterious taste of your first
cigarette,the pain in your heart, the time you get fascinated by
someone's eyes maybe..And mostly, the things that once you had or
experienced; friendship,humor,surprises,the first
hardly-made-decisions,funny and hard times together at the same
time,your first big crush,and the music you were listening, the meaning
of beer(and how it has changed).. Richard Linklater's decision is
1976,for the story to take place in.I think there can be no certain
time for it.I think that day is timeless and for everyone to
remember.That's why it's so special and excellent; unique and common,to
experience once again the time that never come back.
