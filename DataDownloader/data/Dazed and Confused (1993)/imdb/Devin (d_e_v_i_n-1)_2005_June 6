whether you graduated from high school 25 years ago or last week this
movie is for you and (sadly) contains characters just like the kids you
knew. Its an amazing film because of the way it perfectly captures the
time period (Not much has changed since the 70's), and how it manages
to carry so many characters and make every one of them interesting.
Most films would be worthwhile if they could create one character as
deep as these. McConaughey's sticks in my mind as he gives a standout
performance as the creepy older guy picking up on High School girls.
While this takes place in the 70's its not much different today and
thats what makes it so fun to watch; It has no real *plot* its not
about whether the hero gets the girl, or the nerd loses his virginity,
or the bully gets beaten up. It doesn't end in a tragic car crash,
although it does end in some quiet moments of truth, which are not
pressed too hard.<br /><br />Thanks Linklater for making such a fun and surreal movie.
