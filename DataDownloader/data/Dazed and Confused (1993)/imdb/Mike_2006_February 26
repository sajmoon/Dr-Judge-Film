This film may accurately depict high school in the 70's but I must say,
It wasn't unlike my high school experience in the mid 90's. I went to a
small school in an average size town just north of Boston where the
landscape, both physical and economical, was very similar to those in
the movie. There were keg parties in the woods, local hangers-on
mulling around, nearby pool halls, big bashes when parents went away,
booze was easy to get with even the crappiest fake id's, and even much
of the same music was listened to. There were some popular newer bands
that got some time in the 90's like Pearl Jam, Weezer, and a few others
but even at this time, music at parties was dominated by Zeppelin,
Floyd, Sabbath, and a whole slew of other 70's era bands as well as
some 80's bands like GNR and Metallica. What is most similar to my
personal experience and the movie though is the personalities and
different groups that co-existed whiled driving around looking for
something to do. Great movie, couldn't have come out at a better time,
for me anyway.
