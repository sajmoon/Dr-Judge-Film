1999_March 22 

This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Jason London (Twin brother
of Jeremy London of &quot;Mallrats&quot;) plays his best role to date as Randall
&quot;Pink&quot; Floyd. Rory Cochrane (Empire Records) also has a good role as Slater.
This movie showed that life in the 1970's ruled. There are so many funny
lines and the music in this movie kicks. Dazed and Confused also stars Ben
Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Joey Lauren Adams, Adam Goldberg, Shawn
Andrews, Sasha Jenson, and Cole Hauser. So get some friends over sit back
and watch Dazed And Confused.
