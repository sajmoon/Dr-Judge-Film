One of my all-time favorite films.  In my high school,I knew Slater, I wore
Michelle's jeans, and I attended that kegger.  I just wanted the movie not
to end, but to go on and on, into Senior year.  Perhaps longing to enter
into a movie isn't the most typical thing to want to do, but no other film
has evoked this reaction from me. This is a movie I purchsed, loaned to
someone who moved away, and purchased again.  I own the soundtracks
(question:  anyone have any idea why &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; didn't make it on the
soundtrack?)and somehow, these songs that I know pretty much by heart sound
so much better when listened to in context with this movie.  Anyone else
love this film as much as I do? Please e-mail me with your comments; I
promise a response.
