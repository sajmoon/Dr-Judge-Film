DAZED AND CONFUSED (1993) ***1/2 Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Wiley Wiggins,
Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey, Sasha Jenson, Matthew McConaughey, Ben
Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldberg, Marissa
Ribisi,Michelle Burke, Nicky Katt, Deena Martin, Christine Harnos, Christin
Hinojosa.  Fun, crazy and out-there portrayal of teenage anomie, angst and
acceptance for the last day of school circa 1976 in all its gaudy and giddy
splendor.  Fine performances from mostly unknown cast(and on their way to
bigger and better things)  and great soundtrack makes for an authentic ,
nostalgic addition to the likes of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Fast Times at
Ridgemont High&quot;. Look very sharp for Renee Zellweger in an uncredited
blink-and-miss. Fine easy direction by Richard Linklater.
