I love this movie, I had seen it a long time ago and thought it was
hilarious so I rented again and laughed my butt off.  I bought the dvd and
have watched it everday.  It is the most accurate portrait of teen life. 
The music rocked, the cars rocked, the whole movie rocked. I give this one a
9.9/10
