The film everyone was toking about.  There's just something so special about
this movie.  It's an ode to an era of confusion, mayhem, pot, and hazing. 
This is nothing like my high school experience, but everyone I know wishes
they could have had just one wild night like the characters in this
movie.<br /><br />The beauty of the film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  The
characters may be from an entirely different era than those of my
generation, but the feelings of being trapped in high school and just
looking for something more transcends time.  It is a universal feeling to
all.<br /><br />The music is perfect, the costumes and hairstyles are laughable, and the
performances are so earnest and fun.  It is a retrospective tribute to the
fun, wild nights that can only happen in high school or college.  It invokes
feelings of nostalgia, remembrance, and pure exuberance.  The mood is just
set to music perfectly, especially when Lynyrd Skynyrd's `Tuesday's Gone'
plays at the end of the party and Seals and Croft's `Summer Breeze' plays as
the sun is rising on Mitch.<br /><br />The scene on the football field when Floyd is trying to decide where his
future will lead is truly emotional and poignant.  I think we've all had
scenes like this, scenes in our lives that we think will change us forever
and we'll never forget.  However, as the film ends, we see that these
characters have plenty of time to grow old and boring.  Right now is the
time to have one last drunken, festive summer surrounded by friends, and the
time to `wanna dance!'<br /><br />Lastly, I must mention the breakthrough young cast.  Jason London, Ben
Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, and my
personal favorites, Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg.  They were all so great.
 This movie is a must for anyone who enjoys reminiscing
on the good times.<br /><br />10/10
