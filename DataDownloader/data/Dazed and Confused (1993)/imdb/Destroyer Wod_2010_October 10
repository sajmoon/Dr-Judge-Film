Man !!! I saw so much college/university movies about fraternity of
guys doing parties and drinking beer being trash down the toilet when
they where excellent on IMDb that i can&#x27;t put my 2 cents here. All
these movies i mentioned before, i liked them, all the American pies,
all the Van Wilder, College, Accepted, Fired Up, and much more movies
than sometimes dosen&#x27;t even get the half(5/10) on IMDb... Dazed and
Confuzed is from 1993 after all, its not like it was actually a 70s
movie, so you can&#x27;t consider it too much of a classic, and even then.
Im sorry but sure i laugh a couple time, sure when i see dudes smoking
weed and don&#x27;t give a crap about rules... that remember me of
something, but outside that, it feel like another random teenage movie
and even there... Sure they smoke weed for most of the movie but after
that.... The whole pledge thing is beyond stupid. Sure i accept
fraternity movies about pledging, and in the case of American pie beta
house it got funny. I also got &#x22;Going Greek&#x22; and its still funny. But
in this movie, thats the point of just wanting to spank the pledge with
some kind of cricket baton... i don&#x27;t see it. If its just about hitting
them whiteout having them crying or something, just give them a beating
and ends of the line... but even there you need a reason... I mean the
whole initiation pledging process is just so dumb that any normal
person would find it stupid. After that the whole story seem all a
waste to get Mitch(the only character i noticed his name) together with
a girl and thats it... Call me classic... but we need something to fill
the middle, like a bad dude doing &#x22;bad stuff&#x22; so the girl in question
get mad and don&#x27;t see him anymore, and then he conquer her heart
again... i dunno. It just felt like over an hour an a half of 70s boys
and girls smoking weed just for fun and that was the movie. I didn&#x27;t
totally dislike the movie, it had fun parts, but overall i felt we
never get hooked to the main characters(there too many) except Mitch
and the plot seem to got straight to the video club down the street....
which mean not far... For a movie i head so much good and score kind of
hight on IMDb... I&#x27;m very disappointed
