Ok, if you haven't seen this flick, you either hate the 70's or live under a
rock. Ben Affleck, Jason London, Matthew McConaughey, Parker Posey, Adam
Goldberg, if they aren't reason enough, how about the cool 70's music, plus,
haven't you ever found a bunch of teenagers getting drunk on the last day of
school extremely amusing, if you said &quot;Uhhhhh, yeah&quot; this movie is soooo for
you! So what do I think of this flick? As Wooderson says, Alright, Alright,
Alright!
