The title of this film is REALLY great, although I think it is based more on
the director (and writer) than on the film. This is the worst 70's film I
have seen. It is not funny, it is not gross (for a high school flick) and
not really interesting. The only thing that is cool is the music (LISTEN to
the soundtrack if you can). The rest is not so good. I especially disliked
all that weed here pot there stuff (probably I can just go to the next shop
and buy some here) but I generally think that the fuss that is made about
weed in some high school films is too much.<br /><br />4 out of 10<br /><br />WHY IS THERE NO LED ZEPPELIN MUSIC????ARGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
