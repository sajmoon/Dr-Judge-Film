Not what you might expect from a movie like this, but Dazed and
Confused does deliver on many levels. Taking the setup from the classic
American Graffiti and switching the setting to post-Vietnam in 1976,
this is a coming-of-age story about a group of teenagers that for the
most part represents what the entire young generation of that time was
feeling and going through. The film covers one last day of school
filled with many happenings including, hazing freshmen, playing mailbox
baseball and getting shot at, as well as drinking lots of beer and
smoking lots of marijuana. Writer and director Richard Linklater seems
to have a good grip on the material and handles it with real sincerity
and even sympathy towards some of the characters. The ensemble cast is
well-cast and deliver the good dialog with a great sense of realism.
Headlining it are a young Ben Affleck as a crazed senior determined to
make the freshmen&#39;s summer miserable, Milla Jovovich who I don&#39;t think
utters more than five lines in the whole movie, and Matthew McConaughey
as an older guy who still hangs out with the high schoolers but is so
cool and organizes the get-togethers.<br /><br />This movie is very funny in some parts, but it is also very deep. It
doesn&#39;t achieve classical status like American Graffiti or The
Breakfast Club, but it is a strong and realistic portrayal that speaks
to all people at that age where life is either far ahead or right
around the corner. Indeed, there are many scenes with some &quot;brainiacs&quot;
talking about President Ford and his political beliefs, then switching
to deciding whether or not to go to a party. Also, I credit Linklater
for not pulling an American Pie and becoming exceptionally crude and
vulgar with this material. Yes, many teens do talk like this but not
all teens rip off their clothes and have wild sex with each other.<br /><br />All in all, a very good movie that gives a real sense of what it was
like to live in the 1970s, and what it&#39;s like to be young in this
country.
