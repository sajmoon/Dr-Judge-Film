1999_October 4 

Okay, I have many favorite movies but Dazed and Confused is in my Top 3. I
LOVE this movie! It is sooooo awesome. Even though it is set in 1976,
except
the clothes and music nothing has changed about high school. You got your
basic jocks, which makeup a majority of the movie, the popular girls, the
bitches, the potheads, which makeup another majority, the greasers, the
geeks, and the upcoming freshman, which are only 2. I love the way that
mostly everyone is friends with everyone. All you have to do is drink beer
and maybe smoke pot and everyone is cool with you. The main peoples are
jocks Pink, Benny, Dawson, and others, O'Bannion the dumbass who is
repeating his senior year, the nice girls are Jodi Kramer, Shavonne, and
the
girl who never talks forgot her name. The potheads are Pickford, Michelle,
Slater, and more. The geeks who have a theory about everything are
Cynthia,
Mike, and Tony. The upcoming freshman are Mitch Kramer and Sabrina who
both
get with older high schoolers.<br /><br />Anyways, Pickford is suppose to have a huge end of the year bash at his
house, but the keg guy comes early and Pickford gets busted. Meanwhile, th
e
upcoming seniors are somewhat initiating the upcoming freshman. The boys
suffer with paddles, but the girls get trashed and are forced to do
embarrassing thing. While all this is going on, Mitch gets beat and the
nice
guy Pink offers Mitch to ride around, while the nice girl Jodi offers
Sabrina to ride around too. It's got sooo many plots, you have to watch
it.
I give Dazed and Confused 9.5/10 only because it wasn't long enough.
