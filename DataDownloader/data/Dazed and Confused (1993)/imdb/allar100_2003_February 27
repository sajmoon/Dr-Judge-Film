This is a great trip back in time.  Ben Affleck as the ignorant jerk who
got
left behind a year is my favorite character in this fun and laid back
flick.
Dialogue is sharp, and funny.  Direction keeps the film from being
stagnant
and boring.  Acting is very natural and at ease without being lazy.  All
should see this film.  9/10
