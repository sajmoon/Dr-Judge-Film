If you were a teenager in the 1970's anywhere in America you will enter
the &quot;way-back&quot; machine with this movie. Almost every detail is accurate
from the big belt buckles, clothes, long hair, cars, even the price of
gasoline. If you weren't a teen in those days, now you can see what it
was like for those of use that were there.<br /><br />It's presented as a slice of life rather than a story with a plot, but
that's what real life is really like. The story starts in the early
afternoon on the last day of school in June of 1976 and ends the
following morning and follows the activities of several seniors and
three freshmen.<br /><br />As a veteran of the 1970's and in high school at the time this movie
takes place, it was a real nostalgic trip. There's quite a bit of pot
smoking but it's an accurate portrayal of the times and not gratuitous.<br /><br />If you have kids, now they can see what you REALLY did when you were
young - as opposed to what you have (or haven't) told them. ;-)
