If I had to choose from the 5 best teen films ever, this would definitely be
on that list. Some great one-liners, and unforgettable characters. Even
though I did not go to high school in the 70's (I'm only 21) it still
brought back memories back. The best character is Slater. Watch with friends
for a hilarious time.
