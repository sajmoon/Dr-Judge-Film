Let an old-timer (47), one who came of age in the 70s, tell you
whippersnappers something -- maybe three somethings: 1) Linklater
deserves every accolade (and then some) for this masterpiece; 2) D&amp;C
belongs in the pantheon of the top 5 coming-of-age period pieces, and,
I dare say, among the top 50 best films of all time; 3) the 70s really
were as good (and bad) as depicted.<br /><br />D&amp;C can stand on its own filmic merits for the superb casting, acting,
wardrobe, music, dialog, and, of course, direction. But it is its
stunning capture of the looks, feelings, attitudes, and behaviors of
young people during that time that drives it home.<br /><br />There are many priceless moments in this film, despite the fact that I
can&#39;t relate to all of them. For example, the fraternity/sorority-type
hazing antics. In high school? Maybe they did/do that stuff in Texas; I
wouldn&#39;t be surprised.<br /><br />Just a few of the things I enjoyed in this movie:<br /><br />The hot, young teacher with her radical enthusiasm (still running
strong from the 60s) being pursued by the football stud.<br /><br />The ridiculous clothes, which we (in the 70s) really thought were
flattering and cool.<br /><br />The drunk, amorous, and very sexy Jodi enticing Pink to kiss her at the
big party, then shutting him down with a reminder about his girlfriend.<br /><br />The ways in which the experienced guys and gals are always giving
advice to the younger guys and gals, kind of mentoring them.<br /><br />The car talk. In my day, it was all Fords vs. Chevys. Big gas-guzzlers.
No self-respecting American drove a foreign job.<br /><br />The stoners slinking around, always high or about to be. I wasn&#39;t a
doper in high school, but, even if you weren&#39;t a part of that group,
you knew it was going on. This was well before all the anti-drug
hysteria, when soft drugs were hip and fun.<br /><br />The head coach ranting about Pink&#39;s attitude problem. Clint&#39;s macho,
ready-to-kick-some-ass routine. And, of course, Wooderson always on the
make: &#39;That&#39;s what I like about these high school girls, I keep getting
older, they stay the same age.&#39; It&#39;s easy to see why Matthew
McConaughey became a star.<br /><br />I could go on forever. The characters are so vivid, the humor so sharp,
the story line so well woven, the good times so real. See it high. See
it low. But SEE IT!<br /><br />And if you really dig it, there&#39;s a great soft-cover book, Dazed and
Confused (&#39;inspired by the screenplay by Richard Linklater&#39;) that gives
the back story on all the characters, along with lots of historical and
cultural detail on that era.<br /><br />I love this flick.
