There are so many fine movies about high school years that do so many
different things well,: e.g., THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, THE BREAKFAST
CLUB, SIXTEEN CANDLES, the list is endless. But The obvious comparisons
to DAZED AND CONFUSED are to American GRAFFITI and FAST TIMES AT
RIDGEMONT HIGH, because such movies intentionally focus more on the
era, the times, etc., with generous doses of the music.<br /><br />D&#x26;C just does so many things with limited effort. The acting and script
are sloppy; i.e., with just a bit more hands on attention the scenes
could&#x27;ve been filmed, acted, etc., much better. So easily could better
minor plots lines been thrown in (see SIXTEEN CANDLES), not to mention
a better major plot, however silly. The camera work, shooting, etc., is
mediocre. I&#x27;m not talking about more expense: I&#x27;m talking about more
attention, energy, effort, etc.<br /><br />I hate to use the word &#x22;unrealistic&#x22; because the film is by definition
nostalgic haze, but there were so few extras, i.e., it looked like a
school with thirty students and an eight person faculty. I give license
to cast slightly older kids as high school students but the female
&#x22;students&#x22; looked early thirties! I saw few town folk (a parent and cop
or two)and fewer students not into long hair, counterculture, etc. I
understand we&#x27;re talking low budget here, but the absence of these
background props becomes obvious and annoying.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to condemn this flick. Certainly over-hype was largely
responsible for my let-down. But D&#x26;C is just not in the same league as
the other mentioned movies.
