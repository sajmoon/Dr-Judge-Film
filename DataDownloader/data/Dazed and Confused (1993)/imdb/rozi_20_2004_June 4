Outstanding movie on teens ,no matter what generation the scene is
always the same.This movie reminded me of my highschool years,where all
you wanted to do was have fun and party .Not reforming to rules.This
was one movie that didn't make Texas look like abunch of hicks .Loved
that this movie showed what its like in a kinda of small town
(Austin).Climbing the towers partying in the back roads cause the party
got busted is all to familier.The one drag also just driving up and
down .Also the one hang out no one under age can get in unless their
with someone kewl enough to get them in .(lmfao) Man memorys so bad I
give this movie two thumbs up.This movie will always be in my
collection forever.
