When I entered grade 9, I never really got an initiation. Sure the
older kids asked me if I was a minor niner, but I said I was in grade
10. They never paddled my ass, drew a penis on my face or made me push
a penny on the bus floor with my nose. I got through grade 9 with ease.
I also never grew up in the 70&#x27;s so I thought I might miss the whole
generation thing with Dazed and Confused. Even though it was made in
the 90&#x27;s.<br /><br />Who would think that a film about high school kids beating up younger
ones, getting drunk and high and partying all night would make a good
film? Well, I did for one.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is not the first teen party film I&#x27;ve seen, but it
is one of the best, so good that it transcends that genre. Can&#x27;t Hardly
Wait is suppose to be my generation party film, I think, but I feel
more connected to Dazed and Confused then any other. Probably because
Linklater is dedicated to his craft and isn&#x27;t looking to cash in on a
certain craze. I can honestly say this is his best film.<br /><br />It boasts an young cast of early talent, like Ben Affleck, Matthew
McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, and so on. I
think it&#x27;s great to see all of today&#x27;s actors in a film like this, just
having a good time.<br /><br />The film has a great soundtrack that embodies that time era, as it
should. Dazed and Confused is a film that I can enjoy no matter what
mood I&#x27;m in. So many teen high school films these days are moronic and
try way too hard to be funny to immature kids. This is a true high
school film that has heart and doesn&#x27;t need to stoop to that low level,
even with it&#x27;s content being so childish.<br /><br />Sit back, relax and enjoy Dazed and Confused.
