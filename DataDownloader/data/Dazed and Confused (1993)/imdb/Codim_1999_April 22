1999_April 22 

This movie is just great.  That's all, it's simply great.  I watched this a
week or two ago with a few friends and we all loved it.  You can identify
with nearly every character, or know someone who is exactly like the
characters in this film.  There is no real comprehensive story line in the
movie, just a number of smaller plots revolving around individual
characters, and their interaction with each other.  Casting for this film
was superb, each actor really looked the part that they played.  I highly
recommend that if you are between the ages of 14 and 21 you go rent this
movie now.<br /><br />On a side note, Milla Jovovich (Fifth Element chick) is in this.  She is very
hot, rent it just so you can look at her.
