1999_May 25 

Dazed and Confused has its good and bad moments. Realistic? Sometimes. The
good parts were the props,clothes,hairstyles and music. Loved the music!
The
bad parts were the hazing of the freshmen. They did it to excess.
Besides,if
these high school kids were considered the &quot;cool&quot; kids they wouldn't even
bother wasting there time hazing the younger kids,they would just hang out
with their own friends and go do whatever they normally do. Plus that one
kid with the hat got on my nerves to the point where I almost wanted to
kick
in the TV screen,I liked when that other kid in the car finally called him
a
dork. If those kids(the&quot;cool&quot;ones) went to my high school,me and my
friends
would have tormented those chuckleheads.  They would
be considered the retards of the school. This movie is typical teenage
stuff.
