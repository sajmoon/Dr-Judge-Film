Dazed and Confused has a lot in common with Fast Times at Ridgemont
High; both movies contain a lot of future stars playing teenagers, both
have lots of terrific Rock tunes on the soundtrack, and both derive
laughs from their characters and situations and not through jokes,
pratfalls and other typical Hollywood clich&#xE9;s. One difference between
the two films is that Dazed and Confused is a period-piece, filmed in
1993 it takes place in 1976, and directer Richard Linklater does a
marvelous job capturing the habits, the styles and the attitudes of the
era. In that regard maybe this movie is more inspired by &#x22;American
Graffiti&#x22; than Fast Times at Ridgemont. But it doesn&#x27;t matter because
to me D&#x26;C is the best of them all.<br /><br />This movie seems to be as personal to Linklater as it is to me, and its
not so much about plot or big scenes as it is about realism and the
overall flow...and it flows beautifully. The movie follows a group of
high school juniors and another group of 8th graders (next years
seniors and freshmen)through the events surrounding the last day of
school in Austin, Texas in 1976 (the whole film takes place in
approximately 24 hours). We observe the hazing, the partying, some
introspective banter and many familiar rituals as the characters
prepare not just for the summer, but for the next school year and
beyond. This was the same general time period I was in high school, so
this movie had a special impact on me. <br /><br />At this point I need to mention Wooderson (McConaughey,in his film
debut), a key character, he&#x27;s that 20-something dude that still hangs
with the high school crowd. Did every town in America have a guy like
this or what? Wood, Dawson, Slater, Pickford; these guys all remind me
of guys I grew up with in my hometown. <br /><br />The greatness of this film is that it rings so true...the way the
&#x22;jocks&#x22; party with the &#x22;freaks&#x22; (or &#x22;grits&#x27; as they were also called
where I grew up), the way they just aimlessly cruise around in muscle
cars until they find out where the party&#x27;s at, or the mailbox bashing
(here it was beer bottles thrown at signs), or even the bottle cap
flipping...we did that all the time! The only thing i didn&#x27;t see was a
bong. (besides the one Slater was making in shop class..HEY, we did
that too!) Yeah thats right -joints are better for cruising anyway.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie to rent on one of those Friday nights where
you have to work early the next day. I first rented this movie on one
of those very nights. Its a great Friday night movie and why not? No
heavy handed plot, lots of partying and good music, and it makes you
feel good. Speaking of the soundtrack...Linklater makes great use of
period music; We get the gamut of 70s pop/rock including Aerosmith, Ted
Nugent, ZZ Top, War, Dylan and even Black oak Arkansas (remember
them?)....Jim dandy to the rescue! This movie really took me back.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is also a bit of a curio because of all the young
actors (who were all unknown at the time) who went on to star in other
movies. You will see Matthew McConaughey (his best performance ever),
Ben Affleck, Parker Posey (she&#x27;s a riot), Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren
Adams and Milla Jovavich (ok,i&#x27;m reaching now), among others. My only
complaint involving the cast is that Wiley Wiggins&#x27; (as Mitch Kramer)
mannerisms are a bit irritating, but other than that everyone does a
tremendous job. <br /><br />This movie has become like a fascinating time capsule about that
post-revolutionary decade of the 70s, a decade filled with great music,
movies and television (seriously, what the heck has happened to
entertainment in this country?)... so its worth viewing for historical
and social aspects as well as its entertainment value.<br /><br />But anyway, I hope you enjoy one of my personal favorites...a really
cool, funny and realistic look at what teenage life was like in so many
towns in America in the mid-70s.<br /><br />It may be set in Texas, but it could just as easily be Ohio.
