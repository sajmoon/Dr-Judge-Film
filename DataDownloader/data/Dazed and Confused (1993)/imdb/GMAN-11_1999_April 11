1999_April 11 

Although not the greatest of all time it is a pretty great movie that is
fun to watch. True it doesn't really have a plot but so what, some of the
greatest movies have no plot and they still work out fine. This movie is
great for people growing up in at least the 60's, though 90's I am not
totally for sure because the movie is supposed to be from april 1976 and I
wasn't even born till october 1976 but still great.
