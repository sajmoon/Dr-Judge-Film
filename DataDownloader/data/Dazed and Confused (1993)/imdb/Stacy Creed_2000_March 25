I love this movie!  There are a ton of great one-liners and sayings.  Now,
it may not win any awards, or receive high acclaim, but it is certainly a
classic.  Dazed and Confused is a great relaxing comedy.  It is one of
those
day-in-the-life-of movies, not a action movie, not a tear-jerker, but a
really good movie.  There are a lot of actors in this movie that soon
became
big stars later in life.
