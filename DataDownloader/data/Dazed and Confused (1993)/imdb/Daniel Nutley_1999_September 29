1999_September 29 

Watch it once and it's a decent movie. Watch it twice and you start to
really like the movie. Watch it a few more times and then form an
addiction
to this movie. Watching this movie of a group of high school teenagers in
the 70's from the point of view of the high school teens of the 90's it is
almost uncanny the similarities in the talk and lifestyles that they lived
that we live. Let's just put it this way at the high school I graduated
from, half the graduating class had seen this movie at a party at least 3
or
4 times. Me and a few other close friends and lovers of the film had to go
to an Aerosmith concert to hear &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;.  The movie is almost a
philosophy that inspires rebellion in those who watch it. 10 out of 10
