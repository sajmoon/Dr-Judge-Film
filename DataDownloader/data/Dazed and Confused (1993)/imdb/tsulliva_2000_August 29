This movie hit home for me as I graduated &quot;high&quot; school in 1977, a very
realistic portrayal of the aimless partying we used to engage in, and boy
I
miss those days, just cruisin' with a bud and my buds and smoking some
buds.
A bit overzealous on the whole &quot;jocks vs. freaks&quot; motif, but nobody's
perfect.  Would have been nice to include some Yes, Led Zep, Lynyrd
Skynyrd,
and the real Pink Floyd on the soundtrack for historical accuracy.  I
think
everything is always about me, but this movie was the closest thing to an
autobiographical portrayal of my high school years, and I don't even know
Mr. Linklater.
