A better movie about drugs and booze than your nowaday Dude, Where's My Car.
 I mean this movie was wonderfully written unlike some movies.  It's one of
those movies you must see over and over again.  A real classic.  It stars
Jason London and Wiley Wiggins along with big name stars Matthew McConaughey
and Ben Affleck.  Worth your money and your time.
