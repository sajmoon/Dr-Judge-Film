What's the matter with you people? Why do you praise that film so much
?
Personally , I like living situations ,like the characters of the movie
lived, VERY MUCH, BUT I certainly hate sitting on the sofa watching others
living them.
Many imdb users wrote the this movie doesn't have a plot , but who cares ? I
CARE ! You see ,watching a plotless film is like watching a film in which
all you see is a farmer milking a cow, the only difference here is like the
character of that film (the farmer) has less fun than the characters of
Dazed and Confused.
Many others wrote that `if this film doesn't touch you , it means that you
have never had fun like that&#133;and bla,bla,bla..' I believe it's exactly the
opposite,and I suggest you to go live you lives and have fun, instead of
watching the others having it ,and just paralleling yourselves with them.
When I see a movie , I need something to really happen . And if you think
that the director of this movie did well describing the teenage life of the
70s , you should really see what Larry Clark did describing the teenage life
of the 90s ,far more realistic but somehow plotless too. Finally, like Pink
said in the movie `If this is the best time of my life, remind me to kill
myself ` &#133;. 6 out of 10 mostly for the good music(for those who
care).
