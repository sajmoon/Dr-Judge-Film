This movie defined the atmosphere of high school life. I wasn't even
born in the 70s but i was around for the 90s and this movie. We watched
this movie time and time again and basically surrounded our lives
around it...probably wasn't the smartest decisions we ever made but it
sure was fun. My friends and I were the &quot;in crowd and jocks&quot; I remember
waiting for senior year for many different reasons but all were covered
in this movie. The last year of varsity football, the hazing of
underclassmen, the sex, the parties, and the fun stuff we had always
heard about but never experienced. We were seniors and we lived this
movie out in real life everyday, but we were also freshmen at one time
also so we also received the hazing ourselves. I wouldn't change
anything about this period of time in life and this movie will allow
kids 30 years from now to see how we were in high school and how crazy
we all were and it will also remind parents to take it easy on that kid
who comes in at sunrise because we have all been there and we have all
had those nights were we ended it being Dazed and Confused!!!
