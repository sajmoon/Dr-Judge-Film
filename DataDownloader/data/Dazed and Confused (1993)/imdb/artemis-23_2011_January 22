OK, it&#x27;s lean on content and wit, as well as storyline, but if you were
in HS between &#x27;75 and &#x27;77, you will appreciate this flick. I have
watched it at least 10 times, and still can&#x27;t pass it up when it&#x27;s on
the tube. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cult status has everything to do with all of us
who actually had a high school experience similar to this and
completely respect Linklater for recreating a snippet of our youth.<br /><br />Linklater&#x27;s duplication of the time period is right on -- from the
clothes, to the cars, the drugs, and the average-joe blue collar
environ -- and even though shot in Austin, it could have been MY high
school (except our doors were turquoise)and pretty much is
representative of my HS experience.<br /><br />This was one of the first movies to really use a soundtrack in a way
that hits a chord realistically with the time period it represents.
Makes me want to break out a quart of Miller, slip on some sky-high
clogs and bell bottoms and crank up Foghat.<br /><br />This movie isn&#x27;t for everyone, and it&#x27;s not intended to be. It&#x27;s by a
child of the 70&#x27;s FOR us children of the 70&#x27;s. We don&#x27;t care what the
rest of you think -- we enjoy the flashback and revel in it.
