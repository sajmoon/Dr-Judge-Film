2002_July 18 

I went through high school in a smaller town in Canada through the
EIGHTIES,
and I have to say that this movie was almost like personal home-movie
footage for me!  My high school experience was almost identical!  The
completely crazy driving...the excessive substance
abuse...shotgunning...the
high-school euphemisms like &quot;Slater-san&quot; and &quot;John Boy&quot;...the
prankster-level vandalism (i.e. knocking over mailboxes)...making bongs in
woodshop when you're supposed to be doing your term project...the older
guy(s) hanging out...the conceited &quot;crowd&quot;...the stoner &quot;crowd&quot;...the
intellectual &quot;crowd&quot;...the &quot;super dominant male monkey motherf*er&quot;
crowd...the car-talk, and the fact that people drove real American
automobiles...the freshmen getting their feet wet at a seniors'
party...the
prick coach (in my case vice-principal)...the infatuated
romances...<br /><br />I drove a '76 Ford Explorer 1/2 tonne pick-up with a beefed 390cu&quot; plucked
from a '69 Thunderbird in senior high.  I remember &quot;beerbusts&quot;; what we
referred to as &quot;parties at the farm&quot; (an abandoned farm in the area), or
&quot;parties at the sawdust piles&quot; (huge mountains of sawdust at an abandoned
sawmill site).  Instead of kegs, we preferred Texas mickies of rye
whiskey,
but the analogy is eerie! The word was spread the same way by word of
mouth
mere hours before the parties occured in the same manner at popular
hangouts
(instead of &quot;The Emporium&quot;, it was the SportsPlex in my town)!<br /><br />The only thing that seemed out of place were the organized hazing
rituals.<br /><br />I COULD GO ON AND ON!  I agree that this movie should be memorialized as a
classic coming of age film!<br /><br />I do believe that this movie will not relate very well to anyone who grew
up
in suburban sprawl in a large city like Detroit, Los Angeles, Toronto,
Vancouver, or Chicago; you really have to have came from a small to medium
sized town/city to relate.<br /><br />EXCELLENT MOVIE!<br /><br />Chris
