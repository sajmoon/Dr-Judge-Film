This film is about the last day of high school for a bunch of kids.
They smoke, drink, party and get into trouble.<br /><br />People say this film is good, so I had a lot of expectations on it.
However, I find the film really boring. All they do is to talk
streetwise, drink, smoke marijuana, fight each other. There is no major
dramatic scene, no one dies and no one gets punished. There is no
hidden moral message either. Instead it is just a longitudinal collage
of scenes of them enjoying themselves. There is no plot and no story. I
was waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever happened. This
film definitely had 100 minutes of my life wasted.
