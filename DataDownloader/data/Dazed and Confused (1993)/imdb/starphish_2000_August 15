Real life does not have a plot either.  We are so brainwashed by Hollywood
that we don't understand it when a movie doesn't have a plot.  It had
great
acting and great scenes.  I went to High School in the 80's and college in
the early 90's.  This movie reminded me of college in a big way.  Even
though it was the 90's, we had the drugs, parties, hazing, music,
unbelievable stories that paralelled this movie.  The grunge scene of the
early 90's was very similar to the rock scene of the 70's.  The situations
were funny because they were true to life.  The actors spoke as if they
were
not on screen, almost as if we were spying on them.  The movie makes you
feel like you are one of the gang and you are watching your friends, which
is very comforting.  One thing I haven't seen anyone comment on is the
parallels between the characters Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd and Mitch Kramer.  I
found it to be very cool how similar they were.  Both are top athletes of
their class, both received heavy hazings from the seniors, both of them
are
the &quot;cool&quot; person of their class that everyone likes and respects.  You
get
the impression that Mitch is going to have a blast in high school and be
liked very much.  Just like Pink.  I loved this movie.
