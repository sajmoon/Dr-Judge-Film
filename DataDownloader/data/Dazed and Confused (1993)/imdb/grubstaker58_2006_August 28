Yes kiddies..being a High School grad from &#39;76 I will definitely concur
on the &quot;spot-on-ness&quot; of Dazed and Confused, especially in the
music.(although it takes place in Texas, it was a bit lacking in ZZ
Top..&quot;Beer Drinker-Hell Raiser&quot; comes to mind.)Truly a &quot;way-back&quot;
machine with attention to detail:those polyester-nylon Little League
uniforms still make me cringe and those laughable (sansa-belt?)
athletic shorts worn by the football coaches -&quot;yeah,right coach&quot;.The
acting is fine through-out.Yes there was a fair amount of&quot;sparking a
J&quot;(not to mention a laundry list of pills and powders) and cracking a
brewski. The actors are very good- playing variations on the different
&quot;types&quot; found on campus-and off- we had a Wooderson, except he drove a
very souped-up Ford Falcon. Chevelles, AMC Javelins,Mustangs, along
with the Mavericks,Bonnevilles and sundry now extinct- &quot;mom&#39;s&quot; station
wagons-filled the campus parking lot.The movie did an excellent job of
conveying a lost,almost innocent golden gap between a unpleasant time
Watergate-Viet Nam, and the vacuous materialistic soul-deadening
Reagan-MTV- 80&#39;s and the yucky years following.A film worthy of
everyone&#39;s viewing.
