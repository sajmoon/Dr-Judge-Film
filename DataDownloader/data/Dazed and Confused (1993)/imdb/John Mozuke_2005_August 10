I thought this was a great movie in that it took me back, and does
every time to my high school days. It is an excellent depiction of that
time and of the high school and partying experience. Loved the music
and Mathew McCoughnehy as the sleazy older guy that hangs around with
the younger kids is great.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich? I am her biggest fan but I can never and still don't
see why she is listed as a main character. She does absolutely nothing.
I wish they would have used her more. She does sing a few lines of one
of her songs from The Divine Comedy which is a great CD but they have
her doing NOTHING.
