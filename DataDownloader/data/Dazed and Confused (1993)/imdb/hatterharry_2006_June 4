This movie was just plain awful. No story, no point; certainly not a
comedy. It is also quite sad that so many people can relate to this
film. Rampant drug use, school hazing, endless nonsense parties; this
certainly is not how life or school life is today, nor do I hope that
society ever goes back to such a time. Do the people who grew up in the
1970s really want their teenagers to act like this? Do they really look
back on such times with fond memories? <br /><br />This story may appeal to a select few who grew up during that time, but
any one born after 1970 (or before 1955 for that matter) would do well
to take a pass. This is about as timeless as a sundial.
