<br /><br />GOBSMACKED<br /><br />As a Welshman i have always dreamed of living in America,  and
one day will hopefully.
So when i first saw the film while on the TV i was attracted to
it strait away,  but had missed the major part of the film  and
the listings did'nt have the name of the film.  So after about
another six months it was repeated again and I caught the
majority of the film this time,  I loved it so much i went out
and purchased the film,  then after watching it another 10-11
times,  i went and bought the soundtrack 1 and 2,  and the
offical 'scrapbook' for the film.
The film is an instant feel good film,  and I only wish that i
could go back in time to be there '76 and also in  '93 so i
could have been an extra in the background.  If this is american
&gt; life then im on the next flight.  Please e-mail me
if you agree there should be a meeting in
Houston for all fans,
