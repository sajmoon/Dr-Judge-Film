I thought it was a very amusing movie. Myself, I will watch anything
with either of the London boys, as they are fine actors (regardless of
the vehicle they're in). I also found parallels between what I saw in
my school years, exageratted in my case. Unfortunately, one review I
read stated that Renee Zellwegger has an uncredited role. Many people
make this mistake. I myself made this mistake until I learned to
distinguish between Renee and Joey Lauren Adams( of Chasing Amy fame).
Renee was in Empire Records, another teen angst movie. I also enjoyed
Parker Posey's performance as an arrogant senior. She plays so well
these types of roles. This is one of those movies that some of our
leading stars can be seen in, before they were the leaders. Worth a
look of you enjoyed the 70's, or enjoy &quot;culture&quot; movies.
