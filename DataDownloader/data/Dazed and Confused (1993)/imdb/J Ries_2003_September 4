This movie is so realistic of growing up in the mid '70. My teenage days
were a lot like that. It is also about questioning authority, becomming
part
of a group and fitting in. Those were magical times and sometimes I wish I
could go back to relive some of them. This film is so much more than a
'Party' film.
