&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a very entertaining movie, in the &quot;American
Graffiti&quot; tradition of movies about leaving high school.  There are echoes
of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; but there are a lot of things
that the movie does for itself.  There are also echoes of &quot;Dazed and
Confused&quot; in movies such as &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot;. 
The story is basically about seniors hazing incoming freshmen, but then it
turns into a story about growing up.  The freshman that is caught first and
particularly brutalized, turns out to be a big hit at the party, whereas the
jerk that hurt him has paint dumped on him and he drives angrily away. 
There are a few minor flaws in the movie, such how realistic it is, and teen
substance abuse, but it's all in good fun.  The movie is
hilarious,entertaining, and original, but in that grand tradition of high
school movies about growing up and moving on.
