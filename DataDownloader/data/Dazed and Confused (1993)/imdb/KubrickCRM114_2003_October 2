From all the hype I've heard, I really expected more from this movie.  It
was like a high school play written and performed by the special ed. class. 
Each actor is so wooden, you'd think they were reading from cue cards and
focusing on pronouncing the next word rather than being convincing.  There
is no story, really, and Linklater's portrayal of high school is utterly
retarded.  Maybe it's just been too long but I sure don't remember being
taunted with hollow threats like, &quot;I'm gonna make this next year hell for
you, FRESHMAN!&quot;  That's the kind of thing you ONLY hear in extremely stupid
movies and television shows.  More than likely, this movie gained it's
popularity from illiterate stoners and such, but in all reality, this movie
sucked, and Richard Linklater should be nominated for every Razzie for the
next ten years.
