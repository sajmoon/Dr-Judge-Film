heh heh! This is just one of those films which invariably pops up and has to
be seen when you're busy...er... partying... heh. Many screenings are
required to watch this film, in the way that it was meant to be watched -
battered!!! I only wish I could remember the ending.... oh well. This film
rocks. In similar vein check out the Cheech and Chong films. When bonged...
I mean monged, they'll have you in tears.<br /><br />Legalize cannabis!!
