2008_May 5 
Like many other of the reviewers, this movie brought back tremendous
nostalgia, both sad and funny of my high school days in the mid
seventies. We drank beer and we got high, none of us had a clue what we
wanted to do in life, other than have a good time for right now. The
director casted many characters with many overlapping story lines, but
somehow you got to know each of them. There was the stoner who you
couldn&#39;t help but like, even though you worried what would become of
him. There was the star jock, who was losing interest in sports as he
became more interested in girls and partying. There were the smart kids
who knew and articulated what was going on, and you sort of resented
them for it.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn&#39;t sure what the point of the movie was. Except that
it was just like the seventies. Nobody cared. Get me another beer.
Light up another joint. Put in another eight-track. Lets have fun
tonight. Yet I couldn&#39;t help but feel that I would never, ever want our
kids to live the way we did when we were young. It&#39;s amazing so many of
us made it all the way to 2008.
