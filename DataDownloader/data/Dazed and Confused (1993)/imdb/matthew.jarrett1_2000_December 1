I recently watched american pie after so much hype i thought i'd best take
a
look, needless to say i was hugely dissapointed. Dazed and confused however
is a brilliant account of how real teenagers live and behave, although its
an american film and i'm british i still related alot with it, going out
smoking a joint, drinking beer, partying all weekend non stop, all of the
above are spot on. It also gave me the feelings of wanting to relive my
adolescense (even though when i actually was living it all i wanted was it
to end) so if your after an excellent teen flick this is the one, trust me
i'm a doctor!
