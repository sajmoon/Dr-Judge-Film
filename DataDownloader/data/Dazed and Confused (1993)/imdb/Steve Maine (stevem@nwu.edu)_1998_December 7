1998_December 7 

Hands down, this movie is wonderful. Richard Linklater directs a solid cast
through an amusing and often insightful script.<br /><br />This film is a great encapsulation of the American high school experience.
It deals with the interplay between all the little cliques we grew up with;
the stoners, the jocks, the football players, the pseudo-intellectuals, and
the outcasts.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is, above all, a study of the late 70's. However, its
humor and lightheartedness are enough to make this film appeal to anyone.
It's a great film to watch with good food, good beer, and good
friends.
