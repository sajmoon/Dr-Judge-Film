There are certain elements of this movie that make it worth placing
high in the ranks of nostalgic movies.<br /><br />The lack of any huge stars of the time. Sure we can look back and see
Ben Affleck (when he was actually still cool) and McConaughey, but at
the time of the movie everybody was nowhere near A-List status. This
lack of starpower prevents any distraction to focus on the individual
actor/actress and instead allows us to focus instead on the plot and
general vibe of the movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack. Instead of going straight for the most notable names of
the 70s (Zeppelin, Stones, etc.), the soundtrack features the likes of
Frampton (of course 76 was when he came alive) and Alice Cooper.
Although the soundtrack may not have highlighted the absolute best
music of the 70s, the songs are so appropriate and well-integrated that
they augment the nostalgic aura already created by the cinematography.<br /><br />In the end, this movie has stood out to me as one of the great
coming-of-age movies when in fact its really not a coming-of-age movie
at all. It is just a chill, laid back retrospective peace at a couple
of kids looking for trouble in late 70s Texas.<br /><br />The elements of solid acting, good cinematography, and a perfect
soundtrack lead this movie to be one of the crowning examples of
retrospective 70s films (***1/2 out of ****)
