Dazed and Confused is one of the best movies of its genre, if not one
of the best movies ever created. It features no real storyline; high
school kids last day of school for the summer in 1976, the seniors plan
to welcome the new freshman to high school with either a good beating
or humiliation. However, the actors are superb, ones that particularly
stand out are Rory Cochrane and Jason London. It has many great comic
moments and memorable quotes and the soundtrack is one of the best
soundtracks ever featured in a movie. It is one movie that I can watch
over and over and never bore of, the amount of times the word &quot;man&quot; is
mentioned is almost uncountable.. but this just adds to the beauty of
the movie. I have shown many of my friends this film, and not one of
them has not liked it, this is one movie it&#39;s hard to hate, and easy to
love. A cult classic, and one I will treasure for many years to come.
