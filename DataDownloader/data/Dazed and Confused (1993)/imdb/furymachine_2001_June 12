Why Can't All Teen Comedies Be Like This?!?<br /><br />Director and Writer Richard Linklater shows us the last day of school for a
group teens in the seventies. Which contains a lot of truth and heart.<br /><br />From the opening bars of Aerosmith's &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; to the final credit
roll with Foghat's &quot;Slow Ride&quot; you know that you haven't seen just any teen
comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in Texas on the last day of school as a group of teens
prepare for summer, some by going to get Aerosmith tickets, others by hazing
freshman, and some by just simply kickin' back and getting stoned!<br /><br />The film speaks truths, and is very well written. This is one film that will
really make you wish that you had been a teenager three decades ago.<br /><br />It's funny without being totally moronic, and the script doesn't sink as low
as to make it gross out comedy for laughs, it earns genuine belly laughs
from the truthful, intelligent writing and jokes that never miss the mark.<br /><br />A great film to enjoy with friends, especially if any of your friends
resemble some of these characters, I know mine do!<br /><br />**** 1/2 Four and a half out of Five (Excellent)
