dude this is the best movie ever. the guy slater the stoner is just the
best
character ever.  he is the perfect stoner.  but yeah the movie rocks.  the
songs are all great!  i love all of them cause it is about the 70s.  the
characters are all well portrayed with magic.
i would highly recommend this to anybody that likes stuff like what ralph
wiggum said.  but what i am saying is that everybody will like this family
especially all the stereotypes like luigi in the simpsons.  sincerely and
best luck to all apirerers,
derek
