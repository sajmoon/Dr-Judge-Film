This is easily my favorite film of all time.  It used to be Dogma, but after
I saw this on Comedy Central I really enjoyed it and felt that it was
probably the film about teenagers ever made.  It's very original and funny
and had a great story behind it.  I am very glad that I saw this movie and
bought it afterwards.  I really like that there are so many characters that
are involved in the story.  Really goes well for probably anyone, because
probably anyone would relate to it and enjoy it.  It has a catching title
and important story behind it, enough for everyone to enjoy.  Everyone
should definetely see and at first rent this movie.  I would have to give it
a 9.5/10.
