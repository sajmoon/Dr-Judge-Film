Ok not a classic in terms of one of the classic masterpieces of all time but
it is one of the best teen movies that I've ever seen. It happens to be one
of my favourites because it illustrates so amazingly the freedom of the 70s
and just makes you which you were at that high school at that time. With a
killer soundtrack and a really funny young cast this is one movie not to be
missed.
