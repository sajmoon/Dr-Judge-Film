If this is a decent portrayal of life at a high school in the 70's then I am
sorry I was not there.  The film is fun all the way through with laughs, a
little drama and a great cast, furthermore the soundtrack is amazing full of
absolute gems, and why are the london brothers not used so much more because
Dazed and Confused and Mallrats get in my top ten watched films of all time
because they are just so sharp.......
