A very watchable coming-of-age movie.  It helps if you graduated in that
time (mid-70s), which I did, or in that place (Smalltown, Texas), which I
did not.<br /><br />It is not, as one might be lead to believe, a stoner movie, although people
are lighting up throughout the picture, rather it is a coming of age movie
taking place one day and night in May 1976.  Schools out, the new Seniors
are hazing the new Freshmen, and lives are being shaped.
