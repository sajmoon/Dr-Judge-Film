It&#x27;s a film that involves patterns of school hazing, parties, drugs,
and relationships, everything that goes on in a classic high school in
the 1970&#x27;s. The senior students participate in tormenting the freshman
kids with paddling and public humiliation. After they hunt down most of
the younger students, and find out that the original plans for the
party have changed, they begin to prepare for the new party that is in
a field under the Moon Towers. Over the duration of the party the main
characters experience many new things including buying alcohol, smoking
marijuana, getting into fights, and sexual arousal. The film is
particularly accurate for a 70s film considering it was made in another
era, the styles, cars, drugs, and language used are all very time
sensitive. The film provokes many feelings of teen angst, spite,
awkwardness and embarrassment through the feelings of the young
characters but will surely entertain and bring you back to a time of
youth.
