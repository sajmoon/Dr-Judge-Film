This became my all-time favorite comedy the first time I saw it. I was
a small child in the 70's, but I do remember that era somewhat, and the
characters in this movie reminded me so much of my teen-aged neighbors.
The music is right on-one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, a
must-have for any 70's classic rock fans (in fact, it is so
comprehensive, there are two volumes). Superb performances by Jason
London, Sasha Jenson, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, Adam Goldberg,
Parker Posey and Matthew McConaughey highlight this film, but the rest
of the cast is just as great. It is no wonder that a majority of them
went on to become major stars-everyone shines with this hysterically
funny and nostalgic script written and directed by the amazing Richard
Linklater. The movie flows beautifully, every scene is funny, and the
chemistry of the characters is just amazing. Party at the moon tower!
