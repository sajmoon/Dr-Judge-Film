Nice outfits, great cars, good actors..oh, they just forgot one little
thing: a scenario. This is probably the most uninteresting movie that
I've ever seen, unless you're on a total nostalgia trip, which in my
case could only be the case by the fact that I was BORN in 1976. Or
maybe if you need some fashion ideas to start an retro indie band? I
don't know, I'm just trying to find something worth watching that movie
but overall I really wouldn't recommend to waste your time on this. And
how are you supposed to write 10 lines comment about a total absence of
movie plot? Obviously the writers barely managed to write those ten
lines for their movie's script and didn't really care about wasting our
time, so I really don't see why I should.
