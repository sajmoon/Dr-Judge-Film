it is absolutely one of the best films on the face of the planet. I am
only 20 years old and every time I watch this film I start making deals
with God pleading to be able to go to high school in 1974-1976. The
music of this era was the best ever made and I am so ashamed of my rap
and thug generation where everyone has to try and prove how ghetto they
are. This movie is probably Ben Afflecks best performance ever. This
movie successfully creates a tale back in time,and has a melting pot of
some of Americas great actors. Not to mention that every single car
shown in the movie is wanted by almost every single kid in todays
colleges. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING AND 10 OUT OF 10!
