Dazed and Confused (1993) <br /><br />*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br /><br />Richard Linklater&#x27;s nostalgic look back at the final day of school when
the soon-to-be-seniors get drunk and stoned waiting for their first
year at the top of the food chain while the incoming freshmen get
prepared for a year of getting picked on. A wide range of character
drink, smoke and have fun talking about what life is about to offer
them. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that this film did for the 70s what
American GRAFFITI did for the 50s in that it was a very nostalgic look
back for a director who was clearly putting his memories on film so
that future generations could look back and use the film to say that&#x27;s
what it was like back in the day. Director Linklater does a remarkable
job capturing the mood and spirit of teenagers and the colorful
soundtrack really packs a punch even if none of the characters are
really drawn out any. If there was a flaw with the film its the
character who are all lovable but at the same time there&#x27;s really
nothing but one stereotype after another, although some might say this
was done on purpose by the director. What does work here is that the
actors playing these parts are at the top of their game and seeing this
movie today is a lot different than when I saw it in theaters back when
it was first released. I still remember watching this movie and being
impressed by all of the unknowns but when you see the film today it&#x27;s
rather shocking to see how many went on to bigger things. Jason London,
Rory Cochrane, Wiley Wiggins, Adam Goldberg, Matthew McConaughey, Milla
Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck and Parker Posey are just a
few of the familiar faces and all of them do a fine job with their
characters. Another important part of the film is its terrific
soundtrack, which includes the likes of Aerosmith, Bob Dylan, Alice
Cooper, ZZ Top, KISS, Deep Purple, Ted Nugent, Peter Frampton, War,
Nazareth and many others. This soundtrack is certainly a killer album
with one great track after another and there&#x27;s actually more music than
actual dialogue. There&#x27;s no question that the story is fairly light as
there&#x27;s really not too much going on except for drinking and smoking
but I think there was a point to that. I think Linklater is certainly
telling more messages than your typical high school film and there&#x27;s no
question that the quality here is much higher than you&#x27;d normally see.
The young faces and terrific music are two of the biggest highlights
and in the end there&#x27;s no way not to be impressed with what you&#x27;re
seeing.
