1998_September 25 

I loved this film from the first time that I saw it, the way that you seem
to be drawn into many of the characters lives in the short time that you
actually see them for. Also, it is the only film I have ever seen that
improves with being drunk.<br /><br />Cool film. See it while you're young  (or reminiscing)
:)
