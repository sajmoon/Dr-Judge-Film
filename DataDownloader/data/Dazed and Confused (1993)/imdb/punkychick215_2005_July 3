Dude man, this movie rocks! I used to hate the whole 70's genre but
once I saw this movie, I got hooked. I bought the soundtrack awhile
back, before I ever saw the movie and I thought the music was awesome!!
Mostly, I'm into the 80's stuff and punk rock, but now, I LOVE THE
70'S!!!! I don't think the director could've casted it any better
either. Everyone was awesome and really seemed into the script! I watch
the movie like twice a day!! I just love it that much man! Now, I wish
I could've been alive during the 70's so I could've gotten stoned and
drunk like those people did and gone to parties without my parents
freaking out on me. I don't think I will go one day without watching
this movie!
