the 70's i wasn't even a teen but i remember the crazy teens living
with us and this movie reminds me of their stories of their
misadventure's if you don't love the 70's you'll love this movie anyway
the actors all play their roles as if they were born too.besides check
out those rides.chevelle,old chevy truck,gto,el camino.those vehicles
alone are the seventies.innocents meets high school,the adolescent's
and the beast meet.the day your boy or girl becomes a true teenager the
first day of high school.who could not love it worries as small as
winning football games and of course the big one getting your butt
whipped oh well no child support,or alimony,mortgage everythings still
new and your just pacing your way through the madness as its moving a
million miles an hour.
