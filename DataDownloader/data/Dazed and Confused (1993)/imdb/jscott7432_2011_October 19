I have watched this movie so many times I love it. I am a teen now and
this movie makes me wish I lived in the 70&#x27;s. After watching this movie
I feel like I have lived and been through the 70&#x27;s it&#x27;s amazing. I
would give up all the technology, clothes, and the music I like to get
a chance to live in the 70&#x27;s. I wish times were simple again with no
computers, cell phones, etc. The 70&#x27;s just seemed like they were
amazing to live in like how so many kids were cool with smoking pot,
cigarettes, drinking, etc. today that is not the case. I love this
movie so much I don&#x27;t know exactly what it was like to live in the 70&#x27;s
and I never will but this movie is the closet thing I will ever get to
it. Yes I love some things about my generation but that generation was
so much cooler. Whoever made this movie did a really good job.
