How did this movie get over 7 out of ten stars? I guess potheads and
alcoholics who do cruel things to each other are funny? The acting was
horrendous. Look at Matthew McConaughey. What a horrible job acting.
Ben Affleck, other big stars, more bad acting. This movie seems to be
about wasting time. This movie is kids who are wasted wasting time. I
have no problem wasting time by sitting around watching a movie. But
this is not the kind of movie I&#39;d consider wasting my time to see.
Plot? What plot? Ammmm...kids on the last day of school...what they do,
what they think...I hope and pray not every teen is like these kids.
This is supposed to be kids entering 9th grade (plus older ones), and
they are smoking pot, drinking, vandalizing... What positive point does
this movie have??? None. I highly recommend skipping this one. Unless
you like watching underage kids blow their summer away. (well, smoke
pot and drink... didn&#39;t see any &quot;blow&quot;...) Take my advice, unless you
like seeing kids get &quot;wasted&quot;, skip this one.
