What a snapshot of my high school life this movie was! I feel like I
could have written the screenplay. Great acting by budding superstars
made this movie was an instant addition to my most valued movie
collection.<br /><br />If you lived in this era, you'll want to relive the moments portrayed
in this classic film. Most of us are grateful to have been a part of
that transitional period in time. Suffice it to say, most of us are
glad to have actually survived it!<br /><br />See this movie with a bud, yes, with several buds, especially those
buds that appreciate good situational humor and social subtext. This
was a fine film all around.
