A very intelligent film that is all the better for its hints at both
humour
and frustration with life. Determinedly plot-less in that it follows a
succession of events over a night, the great strength of this film is the
numerous and disparate groups it follows. From potheads to poker club the
sluts and jocks of mundane teen gross-outs like American Pie are
distinctly
absent in favour of a whole cast that seems somehow more human. Despite
their different interests and backgrounds, no character is perfect nor
wholly objectionable.<br /><br />Nice to see so many actors and actresses who have become famous in their
youth, but nothing distinguishes them from a cast of unknowns all of whom
perform strongly. Add this to great cars and fantastic soundtrack that is
really representative of the culture presented.<br /><br />Personal favourite moments include the opening Aerosmith (and Pickford's
car!), just about every appearance of Slater, and the comment about
&quot;white
slave owners who didn't want to pay their taxes&quot;, representative of an
entire ethos of 70's subversity in Austin, commonly called an island of
liberalism in the sea of the Deep South.<br /><br />Watch this film, thoroughly engaging and enjoyable if nothing truly
spectacular.
