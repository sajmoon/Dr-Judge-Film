1999_August 11 

I'm completely confused by this film. Nothing happens, ever. There are no
central characters and there's no focus. To top it off the film abruptly
ends with no climax. What's supposed to be going on? Are you supposed to
care about each of the disparate groups? Are you supposed to identify with
one group and support its minor triumphs? Well I didn't, I don't see how I
could have.
