At face value, this is a movie about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. All
good
qualities. But even more, this is a testament to the world of youth. The
slacker generation's answer to the radicals of the 70s. Not an excuse to be
indifferent or lazy, but a plea to the young to enjoy every moment of our
fleeting lives. Richard Linklater directs his brilliant script and an
unparalleled cast of nobodies to greatness. You will recognize several
faces
now, but it was this movie that made them prominent.
