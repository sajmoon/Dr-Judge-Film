I have seen this movie over 10 times and I still love it.  I was very
young
in the 1970's and only remember fragments, but watching this movie is like
looking through my parents' old photo albums.  The long hair, the
bell-bottoms, the 28 year old who still hangs out with high school kids...
what's not to love?<br /><br />Dazed and Confused takes you through one day in the life of a group of
typical teenagers in May 1976.  But regardless of the era, anyone can
relate
to this movie.  I remember my high school hazing back in 1990 being very
similar to what the girls go through in this movie.<br /><br />This movie is nostalgic, witty, and just plain hilarious.  If you like
Fox's
series That 70's Show, you will definitely love Dazed and
Confused.
