1999_August 10 

If somebody told me I'd sit thru a movie where they do little else other
than drink and smoke pot, I'd say they were nuts.  I could not believe
hardly anything else happened!  A chimp could write a better screenplay!
What passes for tension or a story line here is so lame and ridiculous, I
cannot believe anybody involved in the making of this movie got paid for
their efforts.  High school movies have achieved much more than this
drivel,
such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  This movie is about losers, for
losers.  Barf.
