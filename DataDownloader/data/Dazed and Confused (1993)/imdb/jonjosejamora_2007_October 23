It&#39;s bad enough that they ripped off a Led Zep song for the title, and
what is worse is that the conversations are tired and boring. If you
want to watch a &quot;feel good&quot; or funny movie, check out Clerks or the 40
year old Virgin. I guess that i am just warning you not to see such an
overdone flick that really is not worth your time. On the OTHERHAND, if
you liked this movie after watching it, good for you; frankly i did not
see anything worth ranting about which explains my dread for this
flick. <br /><br />Just about the only excuse to watch this movie is if you are a fan of
the following: Jason London, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey
Lauren Adams, and Ben Affleck. I tried to like it since i am a fan of
Joey Loren Adams. This is one of those early films for a lot of these
rising stars. <br /><br />I don&#39;t know what funny or interesting is according to this film. These
are some of the events and themes featured that are supposed to be
interesting: &quot;Stoners&quot; that emit a sense of pride as if they were some
kind of elite. Fraternity style initiations with paddles, ketchup, and
crappy &quot;mean&quot; acting (the initiations are not even believable; i mean
who the hell runs around with a colored kiddie looking paddle?!). High
school queer looking freshmen trying to be mature by talking about the
&quot;babes&quot; of the campus. A football player struggling in terms of
submitting to his coach or not (come on as if any hard working varsity
players would think of quitting the team for pot sessions...). More of
the stupid freshmen trying to fit in (character development for the
least important....). With all of the little details that the film
could do with out, the entire package just gives a sense of
&quot;i-am-running-out-of-ideas-about-where to-go-with-my-characters&quot; kind
of feel. I just don&#39;t know, the whole flick is trite and clich&eacute; that
it&#39;s really nothing special. <br /><br />Coming from the acclaimed Richard L. i am utterly disappointed. I know
that this director can handle a simple and yet beautiful movie that
excels due to the conversations of the characters as seen in &quot;Before
Sunset&quot; (2004) and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995). I know that Before Sunset
and the latter is of a totally different genre but its an example of
how the dialogue can carry the movie and make it extraordinary. Dazed
and Confused relies heavily on what it characters say, which is to say
not much and not at all inspired.<br /><br />Save yourself the time and pass on this one. I guess I also hate this a
little bit too much since it has Ben Affleck in it (his acting never
got better than this; so haha...). But hey, just to neutralize my last
gripe, there is a film that i love with Ben A. directly and indirectly
involved......... Yep its &quot;Goodwill Hunting&quot; (thanks to Ben A. for that
one!).
