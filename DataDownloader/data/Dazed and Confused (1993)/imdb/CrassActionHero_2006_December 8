Dazed and Confused. (1993) Review: D&amp;C is a fun movie. Set during the
70&#39;s, a time I was not around to see, sure made the 70&#39;s look like a
blast. The setup is it is the last day of school and everybody is ready
to let loose and enjoy the summer.<br /><br />The classroom scenes before school let&#39;s out are quite funny. Everybody
is quite laid back. From there, all sorts of stuff happens. We have a
great cast of characters to get acquainted with. One more thing is that
this movie takes place in one very memorable day into night.<br /><br />D&amp;C delivers some clever and nice humor. This is NOT just a pothead
movie, D&amp;C is about potheads, alcohol, and good times. D&amp;C is merely
about the youth of yesteryear having a good time in the 70&#39;s. Also this
features a young Ben Affleck as a brutal bully to Matthew McConaughey
as an easy going fella who is not picky about the ladies.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused also has a decent soundtrack as well. With Alice
Cooper, Ted Nugent, Peter Frompton, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, and War,
Dazed and Confused is a good experience.<br /><br />The Last Word: Groovy.
