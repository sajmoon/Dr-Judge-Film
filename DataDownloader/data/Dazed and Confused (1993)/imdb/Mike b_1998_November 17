This was an excellent film. This Movie With The Last Day Of School For
Seniors Makes Me Think That More People Should Bring Back Hazing Rituals
Like That. Great Cast. Only Thing, What ever happened to Jason London, Cause
His Brother Jeremy Has Been In A Movie And Is Now IN TV. I personally
Thought/THink That Jason Was A Much More Superb Actor Than Jeremy. But
Other Than That, Great Soundtrack, Great Writing Job By Richard
LinkLater.
