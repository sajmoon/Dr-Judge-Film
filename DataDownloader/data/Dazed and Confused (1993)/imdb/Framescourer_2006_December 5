2006_December 5 
A rite of passage/high school flick without an obvious plot but much
more than a montage of familiar scenes. In truth, I&#39;m not quite sure
how Linklater does it. Each set piece is quite self-contained. The main
event of the film, a party, almost fails to happen at all. Instead,
Linklater relies on a carefully balanced script and his cast. The kids
exude naturalism, pinging from experience to experience. Linklater&#39;s
documenting style refuses draw a specific narrative thread or moral
from the movie. If there is any specific epiphany for a character, we
don&#39;t see it.<br /><br />This naturalism works wonders with the retrospection of the film: we
don&#39;t have to suffer the usual assumptions about the 1970s. If there is
a principal character then Jason London&#39;s Pink is it, a beautiful,
gifted - if slightly bland - lad whose character Sofia Coppola must
have noted when casting Josh Hartnet in a similar role in The Virgin
Suicides. All the other roles in the ensemble are equally well-taken.<br /><br />Good natured and quietly affecting 8/10
