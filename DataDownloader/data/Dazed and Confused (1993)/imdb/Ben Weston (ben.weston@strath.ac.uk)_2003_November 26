It feels quite strange writing about something, a film which feels quite
personal to me. Something which i can relate to so well. As i don't want
to
share what was a unique film experience for me. Of course nobody reads
these
well hidden ill-informed comments distributed by the sort of people
willing
and able to efficiently browse through the imdb database.
I am one of those anal retentive people with a thick mist between
fact
and fiction who is happy to muse over film trivia and film characters
outside of the context of the film and Dazed and Confused is such an
appropriate picture for this. By the way my poor grammar can be
attributed
to my Scandinavian origins.
Dazed and Confused is a fantastic film. It isn't underrated, it isn't
under appreciated, it's just under played and that's just fine. As the
fewer
people who know of the film means that my fantasies of being Wooderson
and
ruling his little world in that very short period of history back in '76
are
that much fresher and tangible. My mission in life is to find ten films
which i fall in love with. I've found three, and this is one. &quot;Watch the
leather maan...&quot;
