Dazed and Confused is like watching your own everyday life on film. I am 15
and this movie sums up what I've been doing the past couple of years.
Running over mailboxes, smoking weed, looking for a beerbust and cheating
on
your girlfriends. The crowds have not changed since the 70's. You have the
Popular Jocks who always mess with the freshmen, the Nerdy types who also
like to party, the Stoners who ALWAYS have weed, the Bitchy Conceited group
who also mess with freshmen, the girls who just want to party and there are
people who fit in more than one of the groups. And of course you have the
older guy who still hangs out with the high school crowd. They talk about
various high school stuff like tv shows(Gilligan's Island), football, and
girls with real big knockers. They are always partying, racing cars and
their summer &quot;priorities&quot; are going to Aerosmith concerts rather than
signing their commitments to their football team. It is just a movie that I
think everyone can relate to. Its one of my most favorite movies EVER!!!!!
RENT IT, BUY IT,WHATEVER. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.
