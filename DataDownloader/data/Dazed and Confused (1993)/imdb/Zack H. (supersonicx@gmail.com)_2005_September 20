I love this movie. It's one of my favorite teen comedies. It doesn't
necessarily have a plot, it's basically about the last day of school at
a high school in a small town in Texas in 1976. The soon-to-be seniors
are initiating the soon-to-be freshmen, A few friends are trying to get
Aerosmith tickets, and everyone is trying to party or get stoned,
drunk, or laid. Oh yeah. Dazed and Confused is definitely a cult
classic, and a movie I could watch easily over a million times. Even
though it's about the END of the school year, it's still fun to watch
whenever. Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far. The
soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat,
Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top,
Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd to name a
few bands.<br /><br />This is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made. People
who grew up in the 70's claim this movie captures the time perfectly
(just read some of the reviews here!), and this movie is definitely a
must see. It'll make every young viewer wish they were there partying
and having a good time, and every adult remember the good times they
had during their teenage years. So, if you're looking for an
entertaining flick to watch or want a flick that you AND your buddies
will enjoy, check out &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.
