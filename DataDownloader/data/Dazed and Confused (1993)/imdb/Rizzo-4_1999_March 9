Randy &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd would have been my 10-year-old definition of &quot;foxy&quot; back
in 1976.  The characters in this film are the teenagers my grade school
friends and I idolized in the mid- 70's.  &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, one of the
most unjustly overlooked films of the 90's, is one fun ride.<br /><br />Really far-out cast featuring Matthew McConnaughey in what is easily his
best performance to date.  Watch for Ben Affleck, Jason London, Anthony Rapp
(of &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;) and the alien girl from &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;
as Michelle.
