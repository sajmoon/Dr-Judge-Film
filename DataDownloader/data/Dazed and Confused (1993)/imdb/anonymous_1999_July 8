He played Mitch, of course. That kid makes me laugh every time--
especially
the way he squints and scratches his nose when he gets embarrassed! And
when
someone (Wooderson, I think) asks if he's got a joint: &quot;Ummm.........no,
not
on me, man.&quot; He's the true savior of the movie-- maybe 'cuz he reminds me
of
me. Anyhow, DAZED AND CONFUSED has a place on my top 10 all-time movies,
along such diverse fare as ROSEMARY'S BABY, HOOP DREAMS, and THE BAD NEWS
BEARS. This film gets everything right-- starting from superior casting,
hilarious dialogue, and dozens of specific DETAILS which evoke a time and
place (summer 1976-- when I was 5 years old!) This flick is all about
relaxing, going for steak and eggs after partying all night, and not
worrying about the future-- Randall Pink does, and look where it gets him.
These are ideals which I wholly endorse. Whenever I'm feeling down, I just
pop this trusty film in my VCR and it never fails to cure me. Hearing the
opening strains of &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; does it every time.
