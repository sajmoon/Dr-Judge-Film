Until today, I did not know there was a teen movie that concisely and
accurately portrayed teen life in the mid-70's. Well, kids, let me tell
you
- this film hits it right on. At the time this story is set, I would have
just finished 10th grade. My life and those of my friends was EXACTLY like
this film, summer-after-partying-summer. I am not talking about the plot;
that is specific to the film. But the actual words used in conversations,
the topics discussed, the activities, the character interaction, the
clothes
- it's all so accurate that it's like a documentary! I commend Richard
Linklater for remembering the minutiae of that time period so clearly.
He's
from Texas and I am from a small city in upstate New York, but apparently
the same lifestyle was &quot;partying on&quot; all over this nation. To you young
film
fans - don't let anyone tell you &quot;it couldn't possibly have been like
that.&quot;
I saw it, I lived it; it's true.
