The first time I saw this movie I hated the characters. I hated
watching all the hazing going on and no one bothering to say anything
about it. I hated that even the incoming freshman accepted it so
willingly and then I watched it again and realized that Linklater was a
genius. He didn&#39;t comment on the hazing that went on in the &#39;70s. He
just presented it as it really was and leaves it to the audience to
give their own emotional reaction to it. The movie is so timely now
although the film wouldn&#39;t be as interesting today because everyone
would be sitting around computers being mean to each other on myspace.
Not very cinematic. The performances are great and there&#39;s many scenes
you just love to watch over and over again. Matthew McConaughey has his
character dead-on perfect.
