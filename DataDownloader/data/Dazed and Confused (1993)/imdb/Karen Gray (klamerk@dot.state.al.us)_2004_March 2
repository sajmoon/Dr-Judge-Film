<br /><br />When I first saw this movie, it brought back memories galore. It took
place
the year I graduated from High School in May of 1976. There were some
things
in the movie that we did not do such as the mailbox bashing and the
initiation of the freshmen class, but as far as the hanging out at the
&quot;pool
hall&quot; and listening to classic rock and the beer bash in the woods, it was
all so real to me. It brought back alot of wonderful memories for me, my
classmates and friends that I haven't thought about in a long time. These
were days that I will never forget. I recommend anyone from this era watch
this movie and you will see how I and everyone else can relate to this
movie. Rock on!!!!!!!!
