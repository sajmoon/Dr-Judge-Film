Richard Linklater has made some pretty interesting and entertaining
films. And I think this is one of his best, if not his very best.<br /><br />The film doesn&#x27;t try to over do anything, and that is one of its
greatest strengths. Linklater manages to keep this teen film, with
characters revolving around the end of a school year, very down to
earth and authentic feeling. <br /><br />I&#x27;ve heard some clowns say that there really isn&#x27;t much story to this
film. I disagree, it really does capture the angst and confusion of
teenage youth. It also posses a subtle message, or at least a deep look
at the issue regarding rebellion and conformity. A choice that
basically every teenager is continuously faced with in many different
ways as they grow into adulthood. The answer that the film seems to
come up with is also very grounded. Somewhere in the middle seems to be
the healthy choice that the film expresses. And how true is that? If we
all conformed in every way. Few things would ever progress in any sort
of major way. However if we all just rebelled against every little
thing that society brings upon us, then we really aren&#x27;t even going to
be a well respected part of society for very long. We have to pick our
spots, and for each individual person, we have different things that
suit us regarding each choice.<br /><br />The review I first saw when I came to this page was titled, &#x22;One Of The
Best Teen Movies Ever Made&#x22;. I can&#x27;t say I disagree with that at all.<br /><br />The world would be a pretty boring place if we were all the same. Truth
be told, if we totally conform to everything, we basically die as
individuals. And the world loses the uniqueness that we have to offer.
Living how someone else wants us to live, or how the majority wants us
to live, isn&#x27;t really living our own life at all. We would basically be
living a life that others have placed upon us. Emotionally and
mentally, that can&#x27;t be healthy. We all need at least a few avenues
where we can be free, and creative in some way. Let&#x27;s face it, history
has been filled with this struggle between conformity and rebellion. It
is one of the universal struggles of all people. And this is the
essential spirit of life inside every person that Wooderson refers to
when he says, &#x22;No matter what happens, you gotta keep on livin&#x27;.&#x22;. This
film in my view really is a sort of homage, and celebration to those of
us who have not given up our freedom to choose, and our freedom to be
individuals. How sweet it is!<br /><br />The film is filled with many different kinds of characters. And most of
them are likable, and easy to relate to in some way. Just as most real
people are. We may not like everyone, but if we are honest. Most people
who do have individuality are at least likable in some way, and at the
same time. We all share some common ground. The characters are just
another part of this film that makes it so authentic feeling.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that this film has some moments that are funny as
hell? There is a lot that can be said about this film. It is hardly a
run of the mill film with a meaningless story. Keep on rockin&#x27; in the
free world punks!
