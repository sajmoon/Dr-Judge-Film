1999_June 21 

For the record, in the spring of 1976 I was just out of diapers... I don't
drink, I don't smoke, and in high school sex to me was like the the moon-
some people have been there, but you don't ever expect to make the
trip.<br /><br />That said, I declare &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; to be the funniest and truest
depiction of contemporary high school culture that I've seen.  The
initiations, the hierarchies, the humiliations- it's all
here.<br /><br />And, after probably 30-odd times, I can say that it's even better on
repeat
viewings; the script, performances, editing and source music are in
absolute
syncronization.  When its elements  work together this perfectly, a movie
seems effortless- but don't be fooled, there's a wizard behind the
curtain.
Exhibitionism is so often mistaken for style, but Richard Linklater
prefers
to remain in the woodwork and the movie is better for it.<br /><br />The humor in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is based on familiarity, not shock or
surprise, and so it doesn't expire like what passes for so many of today's
so-called comedies.  Details like Mitch's tics, and the ever-present use
of
the word &quot;man&quot;, ground the elliptical narrative in character, not
gimmickry-
and make the movie that much funnier.<br /><br />There's actually much more here than yuks, though you have to listen for
it.
A definite perspective is threaded in the sentiments as expressed by the
characters throughout the movie.
The brilliance lies in the way Richard Linklater puts this point across,
much more eloquently and powerful than can be stated in a synopsis or a
review...  D&amp;C is just about the most palatable &quot;message&quot; movie in
existence.<br /><br />Side note:  while I'm sure that its depiction of the era owes as much to
the
looking-glass of the 1990s, D&amp;C isn't, unlike some of the films to which
it
is compared (&quot;American Graffiti&quot;, namely), mired in nostalgia or fetishes.
And so, while firmly placed in a time, it isn't only for the Gen X
set.<br /><br />(p.s. yeah, if I'm anybody I'm Tony- hey, at least I would get a shot at
Sabrina.)
