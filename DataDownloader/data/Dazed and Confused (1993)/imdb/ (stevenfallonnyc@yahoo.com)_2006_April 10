I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve heard and read so many good things about this very
dull film. Not only is &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; boring as hell, with
virtually nothing at all happening for at least 30 minutes, it strains
so hard to depict the 70&#39;s that it comes across as something along the
lines of a high school play in the 90s.<br /><br />That&#39;s not to say the &quot;fly on the wall&quot; technique is a bad thing, it
works wonders in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush.&quot; But who cares about this
group of kids? There&#39;s no one particularly engaging, no one special
here. If the characters were in the least bit engaging, then maybe we
could sit through tripe like &quot;freshman initiations&quot; with paddles for
the guys and making a mess of the girls. It&#39;s just eye-rolling
material.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the sole character in the entire film that is in
the least bit interesting is the &quot;older&quot; guy, Wooderson, who makes a
few funny comments (especially about how high school girls always stay
the same age) and has a decent funny style. He&#39;s really the only
character worth watching at all. The picture picks up a bit when he
come sinto the scene, and levels off when he&#39;s around all the tripe. <br /><br />The filmmakers make one huge mistake that makes the film seem so fake.
All the cars in the film are wrong. Sure, they are all made before
1976, when the film takes place. But they all look brand new. In other
words, the filmmakers hired &quot;classic cars&quot; from car collectors who
obviously restored them previously, and restored classic cars is all
you see on screen. There&#39;s not a &quot;jalopy&quot; in sight, not a &quot;beater&quot; of
any kind. Even the pickup trucks look restored, without any dirt on
them whatsoever. There&#39;s never any dents, rust, or any indication of
&quot;normal use&quot; or &quot;age&quot; on any of the vehicles. And in any parking lot
scene, it looks like you are at an outdoor classic car show, with all
the restored vehicles on display. The filmmakers really blew it here
big-time.<br /><br />They even have a Robert Carradine-looking guy, Carradine of course
being a vet of many &quot;teen&quot; flicks of the seventies. The filmmakers
couldn&#39;t even get the KISS song right, as they use a horrible late-80s
remixed &quot;Rock and Roll All Night&quot; instead of the classic &#39;75 studio
album original, or the hit single from their 1975 &quot;KISS Alive&quot; album.
Not to mention a kid wearing a KISS &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; t-shirt half a
year before the album came out.<br /><br />&quot;Dazed&quot; can&#39;t even begin to touch something like &quot;American Graffiti.&quot;
As far as 70&#39;s flicks go, &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is actually much more fun to
watch than this movie. Maybe with something that resembled a script in
some way, this could have been more fun to watch, even with the
straining and the restored cars. There are some hot girls, with the
hottest being the one the geek blond guy with the glasses gets, but
even they seem strained as far as their &quot;look&quot; is concerned. This film
is a total mess, and really it just comes across as a huge 70&#39;s
dress-up party and restored classic car show from the 90&#39;s.
