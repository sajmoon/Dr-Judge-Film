Just finished watching DAZED AND CONFUSED again 10 years after my initial
viewing, and it got way better as an encore performance.  I didn't have a
clue as to who Richard Linklater and all the unknown actors were the first
time around, but as many of them have gone on to various levels of stardom
since '93, it was fun to see them again &quot;in the beginning&quot;.  I especially
liked seeing Ben Affleck &quot;13th billed&quot;, as he plays much better to me as an
also-ran after all the tabloid hype he's subjected me to since garnering his
GOOD WILL HUNTING oscar.<br /><br />I'm the exact age that &quot;Pink&quot; and his cronies were in May of '76 (just
finished up my junior year of high school), and even though I grew up about
1200 miles north of Austin, TX, most of the hijinx portrayed in the film
rang true.  Save for the hazing, we did it all, driving endlessly around
town looking for &quot;a good time&quot;.  And once the word got out that a kegger was
going on, it sure didn't take long for a crowd to form in some &quot;secret
spot&quot;.  Judging from some of the posts about this film, the search for &quot;a
good buzz&quot; is still the preferred way to make it through the high school
years in 2004.<br /><br />Hats off to Mr. Linklater, his soundtrack, and his film.  So grab a &quot;sixer&quot;,
break out your stash, and check out DAZED AND CONFUSED.  It's way closer to
the way it was in 1976 than watching a WELCOME BACK KOTTER rerun.
