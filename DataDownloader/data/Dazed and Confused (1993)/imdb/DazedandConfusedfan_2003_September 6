What a perfect movie, great accuarte soundtrack. Unfortunately I wasnt
around to experience all the 70's had to offer so I use this movie as a
reference.  I dont understand-they say the town was &quot;dead&quot; moontower scene
but werent they a 5A school? There is a real moon tower and Top Notch as
well as Robert E. Lee HS in Austin, TX where the movie was filmed. Where
does the movie 'supposedly' take place?
Did you ever notice, Julie (Mitch's girlfriend, Mitch himself, Slater,
Don,
Tony, Mel and Sabrina never really got bigger roles in life even tho they
did so well in this movie? Matthew M and Afleck are the only big current
stars. Everyone else just faded.
Great movie bc everyone can identify themselves with a character and their
HS. Wooderson made the movie awesome!
