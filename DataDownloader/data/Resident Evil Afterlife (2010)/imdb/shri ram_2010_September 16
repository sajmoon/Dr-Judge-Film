I entered the theater just expecting an average plot with gr8 action
sequences in 3-d naturally....but this movie had nothing but clich&#xE9;
after clich&#xE9;....!! stunt sequences was OK...rest of the movie was just
2d...almost all the scenes were totally predictable.<br /><br />Most of the action sequences looked familiar,the acting was also not
that good.Stunts like fighting with a giant zombie in slow motion while
they could just escape through the tunnel was irritating crap...!! <br /><br />The movie looked almost like an animation movie with all that cg.They
should have concentrated more on the plot or at least the action
sequences...Resident evil leaves most of the audiences unsatisfied and
some irritated...
