First and foremost, how does this guy keep getting to direct movies? I
would first suggest taking a browse through what he had directed
previously. Go on, this review will still be here....<br /><br />Finished looking? Impressed with his movies that flopped harder than
someone having a seizure?<br /><br />Now after you&#x27;re done looking at his classic hits such as &#x22;Deathrace&#x22;
&#x22;AvP&#x22; and the classic &#x22;Mortal Kombat&#x22; and thought &#x22;hey those were
good... alright at least decent movies&#x22; please skip over this review
because your intellect may not be capable of comprehending this review,
and by all means go see this movie since you&#x27;re most likely catatonic.<br /><br />So finally we get to the movie, undeniably I am a gamer, and Resident
Evil fan, but also an avid horror and action movie buff. This movie
fails on all those categories, and leads me to believe Mr. Anderson
also rode the short bus to school, although not in full blown retard
gear. Now if you are remotely expecting any of those, what-so-ever make
note, any sense of &#x22;horror&#x22; is completely non-existent, the action
scenes you can count on 3 fingers, and lastly the way he completely
makes a farce of game tie-ins will make every single RE fan explode
with nerd rage.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen the trailer already, I would highly suggest
watching it, just for Milla Jovovich, and her horribly acted and edited
in &#x22;clones&#x22;. It&#x27;s like the director told her before filming &#x22;No Milla,
you only get paid once, your clones don&#x27;t get paid as well&#x22; since her
disappointment and willingness to act certainly shows.<br /><br />In closing, I can only highly suggest skipping this, saving your money,
and hoping Paul Anderson stops making horrible game to movie tie-ins.
