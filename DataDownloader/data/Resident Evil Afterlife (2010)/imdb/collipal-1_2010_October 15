After two horrible movies, the Resident Evil saga redeemed itself (at
least in my humble opinion) with the third part, subtitled Extinction,
because even though it was not a great or highly memorable movie, it
was entertaining and with a consistent and well structured screenplay
which left the disjointed and modular narrative from the first two
films behind.Unfortunately, Resident Evil 4: Afterlife goes back to the
arbitrary twists and forced logic from the first two films (although on
a lesser degree), at the same time it bored me and it left me
dissatisfied.<br /><br />To start with, the screenplay from Resident Evil: Resurrection is
absolutely hollow, and the worst thing of all is that it seems that
screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson (who was also the director) did not
even care to construct a coherent story, because he thought that the
abundance of &#x22;cool&#x22; action scenes, with slow-motion action, explosions
and stunts would be enough for the audience to ignore the fact that the
film lacks of a solid story.Big mistake from his part.And Anderson also
failed on his work as a director in here, because he is absolutely
unable to create atmosphere, or emotions to endorse the action we see
on scene.In other words, there was not even one single second in
Resident Evil: Afterlife in which I felt even the slightest amazement,
anguish or suspense.And that lack of an emotional support is the main
thing which sinks to this movie.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I cannot recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife, because
I found it to be unsatisfactory and boring.By the way, after watching
this film, I remembered the time in which it was assumed that the great
George A. Romero was going to direct the original Resident
Evil.Unfortunately, that did not happen, but in case a fifth movie from
this saga gets made, I hope the works of directing and writing the
screenplay are given to him, because what it would need are not more
fights filmed on &#x22;bullet time&#x22;, but more atmosphere and narrative
deepness.
