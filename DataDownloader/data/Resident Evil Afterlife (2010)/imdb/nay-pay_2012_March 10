I just think it&#x27;s strange that there have been 1 or 2 decent films in
this series. Extinction was a decent movie. How do they keep getting
Mila to come back and do these terrible ones. I mean that&#x27;s barely B
quality. I only got 1/3rd of the way through this junk it&#x27;s so
painful.. i mean PAINFUL. To even attempt to watch this mindbogglingly
terrible &#x22;film&#x22; making i need pot, alcohol and many pills. But then I&#x27;d
be dead before the movie ended. So I guess my question is, how does a
movie this terrible get anywhere near the rating it has? I mean, I
can&#x27;t trust the ratings on this website anymore. I&#x27;ve seen quality,
good movies get worse ratings than this thing. It&#x27;s disturbing I tell
you. What is wrong with people? If i had the option i would rate it -10
out of 100. IMDb should be a good site to reference title choices but
it&#x27;s not... I&#x27;m afraid.
