Decent movie, but in my opinion the worst of the series. It didn&#x27;t
really serve a purpose. It didn&#x27;t really do anything for the series and
nothing is explained. It starts off great but as the movie progresses
it becomes clear that this movie has no story whatsoever. Nothing
important happens. I loved the action sequence...s, special effects,
and the acting by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. But Wentworth Miller
and Shawn Roberts who plays Albert Wesker are just awful. Spencer
Locke(Couger Town, Resident Evil 3) just doesn&#x27;t have enough screen
time to show her potential. It&#x27;s nice to finally see Boris Kodjoe on
the big screen instead of a straight to DVD movie like StarShip
Troopers 3. He was the best actor in ST3. Out of all Paul W.S.
Anderson&#x27;s movies this is his worst. This movie had potential to be
good but I know there are a lot of people out there who hate is movies,
but I personally enjoyed Event Horizon and Aliens Vs Predator. All in
all I was excited to see this and had high hopes for it but it left me
disappointed. I don&#x27;t want to spoil anything but there will be a sequel
which I HOPE will be better and actually have a story.
