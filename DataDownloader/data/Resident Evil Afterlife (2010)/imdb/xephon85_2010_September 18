2010_September 18 
I can hardly begin to explain how annoyed and disappointed I was when I
watched this movie, but I will try my best so that people use the 10
dollars on coffee or something more rewarding. I have seen the past
three films and I&#x27;m not going to say they&#x27;re great but I&#x27;ll say I
expected more, not only out of the franchise but out of action movies
in general. When you sit down to watch this movie just expect to see
more slow mo than real time, just the tossing of a gun with no true
time urgency in the &#x22;plot&#x22; or getting up off the ground is granted a 30
second slow mo scene. Every scare and action move, or set up I have
seen a thousand times before and filmed in much better ways, this might
as well have been shot like sin city with as much CGI is hurled into
the viewers eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t look good anyway. I&#x27;ve watched almost
all the 3D movies that have come out but this one hurt my eyes. Every
time a &#x22;plot twist&#x22; or a &#x22;cool&#x22; line was said I was thinking &#x22;Really? I
mean Really?&#x22; this is only the second movie I&#x27;ve ever seen that I
almost walked out of. I am disappointed to no end if this is what is
thought of as a great action movie. Has Ridley Scott, James Cameron,
Christopher Nolen, Edger Wright, Sergio Leone, Quentin Tarantino, or
Stanley Kubrick taught us nothing of what to expect out of a horror or
action movie?
