I liked this compilation of scenes. I liked the soundtrack; I liked the
acting; I liked the settings; I liked the effects. As a game, it works
greatly. The movie is a sum of chunks of stories. Most of them are
action stories. A few are horror stories. Another few are mystery
stories. And none of them are connected to each other. They just share
common characters. <br /><br />Honestly, the plot is just an excuse for great action scenes. And I
liked the action scenes. I rate it zero for the story, ten for the
technical quality. And I have to admit it: in the end, I liked it as a
whole.
