Wow, directing a slick fx movie and putting your name to it is one
thing, no shame in that but telling people you came up with this
children&#x27;s school play of dialog wouldn&#x27;t seem to be a wise move.
Embarrassingly bad dialog and shonky characters even for the cartoon
nature of the show drag this juggernaut down down down. It didn&#x27;t help
that it was continuing the franchise of an instantly forgettable series
and required you to remember who was what and why they were there from
previous movies. I&#x27;ve seen them all and couldn&#x27;t for the life of me
remember a single thing about the last movie, it was that disposable.
All that money and style up on screen and they couldn&#x27;t do any better
than this? it seems such a waste. eye candy fluff, if that&#x27;s enough. it
isn&#x27;t for me, anymore.
