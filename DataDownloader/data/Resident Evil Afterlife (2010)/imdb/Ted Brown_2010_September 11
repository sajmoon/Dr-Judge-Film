I&#x27;m not sure where to start when it comes to &#x22;Resident Evil :
Afterlife&#x22;, I went into this film totally unaware what it was about
beyond it was the next Resident Evil film, I had avoided trailers and
spoilers and sneak peeks successfully hoping that it would be a solid
addition to the franchise, but at the same time was worried it would be
more of what the third one served up, to my surprise the situation was
much more dire as this is hands down the worse movie of the franchise
thus far.<br /><br />&#x22;Resident Evil : Afterlife&#x22; moves at such a slow and uninteresting pace
that by the time you even see a &#x22;zombie&#x22; you are half asleep and
wondering if you have been duped into a zombie less world. Don&#x27;t fret
this is not the case there are in fact billions and billions of flesh
eating horde roaming the streets of the world, but you won&#x27;t get to see
many of them because the only time their interjected into the main
story arch is when they need to dispose of a unneeded character, always
in a sudden and unimaginative fashion and to the shock of myself with
very little gore, but I will go into that later on in this review.<br /><br />The story felt thrown together and just void of any effort, with so
many cases of &#x22;six months later&#x22;,&#x22; 2 years later&#x22; etc it&#x27;s hard to
figure out the time-line during the first watch. And the ending felt so
tacked on I started to have flashbacks from the &#x22;House of The Dead&#x22;
film as quality comparison.<br /><br />Where the f*#k was the gore? Honestly the only real gore you see is
when it comes to dispatching various umbrella baddies, most of the time
when anything interesting occurs the camera cuts away and you are
thrown away from the action into a new scene, very disappointing for
any zombie fans out there hoping to see some people get eaten and such.
The movie has a few nice special FX moments but not nearly enough to
warrant seeing it, and to be fair some pretty awesome 3D scenes.<br /><br />The over use of slow-mo, freeze frame, and bullet time made the movie
feel like it would of been a better 45 minute short to be released as
fan service, I honestly felt like I had been tossed into a time machine
and transported to when &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; was first released and everyone
and their mom was using the bullet time and slow-mo gimmick in their
action flicks.<br /><br />Over all I really disliked this film, from the bad use of outdated
gimmicks, to the uninteresting disposable characters that felt like
they were added in just so they could justify killing someone, to the
sporadic time line the film attempts to create , it was all in all just
a bad movie. My score on behalf of The Liberal Dead is a very weak and
below average 3 out of 10 and award for most occurrences of &#x22;jumping
the shark&#x22; I have witnessed in a single film to date.<br /><br />- Ted Brown &#x22;liberaldead.com&#x22;
