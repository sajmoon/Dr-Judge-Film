This is a OK Film, When I started, I really liked it but after a while
I got very very bored until I finally turned it off, I would say that
this Film is good, But if something else catches your attention, you
may quickly start to lose Interest in the Film. <br /><br />So overall, It is a very good action film, But if you start of do
something else other than the Film, You may lost Interest and get Bored
after a while of it or If something else catches your attention, But If
you are focused on the Film, You will probably enjoy it the whole way
through more, I give it a 4 out of 10. <br /><br />That was my review, I hope that you found this Review helpful.
