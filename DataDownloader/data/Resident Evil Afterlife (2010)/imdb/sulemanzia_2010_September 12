I have never written a review for a movie on IMDb. But i feel like
people should know the truth about this movie. I always go to IMDb.com
and search for the ratings and review before watching a movie. Tickets
are expensive so always try to find different ways to save money. For
this movie i read reviews on IMDb with 8.7/10 rating i was very calm
that the movie will be a blast.<br /><br />I went to the theatre and started watching it and boy o boy. This movie
is by far the worst resident evil i have encountered. Horrible fight
sequences, ridiculous story. This movie did not do a justification to
resident evil franchise. How in the world with one injection you take
all the powers ?. There are so many other flaws. This was the first
movie where i started yawning and felt sleepy.<br /><br />Overall if you have time to waste money then go for it.
