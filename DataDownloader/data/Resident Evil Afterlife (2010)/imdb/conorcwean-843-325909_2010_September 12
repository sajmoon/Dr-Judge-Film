Where do i begin? What an amazing movie. In my Opinion best of the
franchise as it is much more fun with this one. Loved the futuristic
feel to this movie as it wasn&#x27;t in any other of the franchise. This is
one of the best sci-fi actions i have ever seen and it is so wel done,
also the 3D just adds to the greatness and is in my opinion better than
avatars 3d technology even though they were the same. Don&#x27;t really
understand the people who hate this movie. I mean come on, its got
zombies, great action and on top of that Milla Jovovich and not to
mention amazing 3D. im going to shut up now before i get too over
excited but wow. A real must see, 10/10!!!
