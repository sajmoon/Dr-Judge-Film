The dialog is so bad you&#x27;d think it was written with crayons.<br /><br />The character development is as a classic study in winging-it The

one intellectual property, many uses (eg resident evil the franchise is
now a video game, movie, collectible figures, etc...) - or something
along those lines.<br /><br />I&#x27;d like to clarify his philosophy by saying it&#x27;s more akin to &#x22;One
turd, many stenches&#x22;
