Milla Jovovich is back for the fourth installment of the series and
this chapter is a whole lot better than the previous ones.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a huge fan of both games and movies so it was great to see that
this movie was closer to the games.<br /><br />3D does its job and delivers the greatest action and fight sequences
I&#x27;ve seen in years. The creators used slow motion and made RE:A look
like Matrix in some scenes.<br /><br />All the actors tried their best to make characters believable.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich proves one more time that the role of Alice fits her the
most and establishes herself as one of the biggest female action stars.<br /><br />Ali Larter plays Claire Redfield again and Wentworth Miller is her big
brother Chris Redfield. I wish there had been more of them in the movie
but the game fans will be pleased anyway to see them in action.<br /><br />However, the brightest star of this movie is Shawn Roberts. Every time
he shows up on the screen as the main antagonist Albert Wesker he
steals the scene. Wesker is sexy as hell and totally bad-ass, I can&#x27;t
think of anyone who could have played this character better.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie 9 is a bit disappointing ending - it
leaves guessing what&#x27;s going to happen next. On the other hand, it
suggests that there will be fifth part and we can hope it&#x27;s going to be
even better than the fourth.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a candy for both RE and action fans. The
fight scenes will leave you amused. If you&#x27;re going to see this film,
do yourself a favor and see it in theater in 3D - that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s
meant to be seen. You won&#x27;t regret it - the movie is worth the ticket
price. And don&#x27;t rush out of the cinema afterwords - if you stay a
couple more minutes as the credits roll, you&#x27;ll see the big twist.
