Alice is back again but she could have stayed away. She returns to kick
more zombie butt, too bad she does in it such an old,
been-there-done-that fashion. Tired effects from 1999 were used way too
much in the movie. What happened? Did somebody see the original Matrix
and think, &#x22;Ooo let&#x27;s let Alice run wild with these cool effects?&#x22; It
would have been cool&#x85;at the turn of the century. Now, it&#x27;s just plain
boring. How many times have you seen the effect where the subject is
frozen and the camera swings around them? Or how about the slow motion
bullet dodge. That effect has been used in everything from commercials
to Stewie and Lois on the family guy.<br /><br />When it comes to the scare factor and gore, the scare factor was weak.
Again the producers used a warmed over effect, the peeled open face
thing from the Blade series. It would have been better to see Alice and
company kill zombies the old fashioned way, with wired acrobatic
martial arts moves, knives, swords, guns and bombs.<br /><br />The gore factor was mild, no arterial blood squirting in 3D or
anything. Speaking of that, why is the movie in 3D? It adds absolutely
nothing to the experience or the story. O.k. Hollywood it&#x27;s been a
couple of years now of having America sit in theaters with plastic
glasses on, enough is enough.<br /><br />The movie company already has a Resident Evil 5 in the works. Boy, they
do know how to beat a dead horse. (Spoiler alert) Trecia Helfer (6 from
Battlestar Galactica) is great but do you really want to pay full price
to see her in future zombie flick #5? So, in a nutshell if you like the
series it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s good or not you&#x27;ll pay full
price to see Alice. But otherwise keep your money in your pocket.<br /><br />www.rivareviews.com
