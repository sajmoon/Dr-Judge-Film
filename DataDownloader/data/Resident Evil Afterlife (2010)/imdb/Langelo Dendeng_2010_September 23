When I knew the 4th Sequel of this movie was about to be released, my
expectation was went high. The queue to watch the premier last week was
awful! The first 60 minutes of this movie was just incredible. But,
when the movie starting to show some out of mind scenes (ex: matrix
scene, alien scene, etc)...My mind just blown from a very good movie to
a disappointing movie.<br /><br />I rate this movie 4/10 because the last 30 minutes of the movie was
just boring and most of the scenes were expected! I don&#x27;t recommend
this movie for people who held high for a better movie than the last
sequel.
