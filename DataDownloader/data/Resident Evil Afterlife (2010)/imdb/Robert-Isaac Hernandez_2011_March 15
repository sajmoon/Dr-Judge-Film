It&#x27;s an entertaining sci-fiction/horror film! I really like it! Unlike
most of the Resident Evil movies, this has some sci-fiction in it. This
movie was a great start to the series! The acting is great and it has
some action in it! I&#x27;m already a fan of these series. If you like sci
fiction movies then this is for you! Milla Jovovich is great as always!
She has some great fighting moves! The rest of the cast were great in
this movie! I really had no problem with this film! Highly recommended
to fans of sci-fiction &#x26; action. If you&#x27;re a fan of horror, maybe
you&#x27;ll like this or maybe not. Even though it deals with zombies, it&#x27;s
not scary. But it&#x27;s stil an awesome movie!
