This movie is the worst Resident evil, it is so Cheesy, I just can&#x27;t
understand why people give such a good reviews, because I went to the
movie yesterday and I laughed out of disappointment mostly. The script
is just awful. Mistakes everywhere. Zombies and ...people pop out of
nowhere and everywhere. Shooting but leaving no dead corpses around. In
the beginning Milla actually becomes normal human again but still
survives jet explosion somehow. People i beg you not to go to see this
movie and support such a bad organization of really good game series.
Do yourself a favor and try the game. The game makes a lot more sense
and the plot is much better. I give this movie 1/10 because it actually
worths just 1. I hate all the people who give more, because they
mislead other people into buying a ticket and watching such a disaster.
