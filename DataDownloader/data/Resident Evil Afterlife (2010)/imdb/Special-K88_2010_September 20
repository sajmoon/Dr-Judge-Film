The undead won&#x27;t be denied in this fourth installment of the Resident
Evil series. The world as mankind once knew it no longer exists, and
with the exception of a few resilient survivors all humans have mutated
into deadly, flesh-eating zombies. Alice (Jovovich) is a resourceful
survivor and hardened warrior who battles against the reprehensible
Umbrella Corporation, but before she can lead a definitive strike she
has to locate the remaining survivors and Earth&#x27;s last bit of
infection-free haven. The series formula is strained, to say the least,
but the film makes effective use of its violent, in-your-face 3-D
action scenes, anchored by the scrappy, always reliable Jovovich in the
lead. Offers some fun when you don&#x27;t think about it too much, there
just isn&#x27;t much of a story to tell. A good way to pass the time for
series fans, others needn&#x27;t bother. **
