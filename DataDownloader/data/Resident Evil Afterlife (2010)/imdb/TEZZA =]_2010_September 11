This film is the best instalment to the trilogy, i went in with major
high expectations for this films, it was that bad i was running away
from people who have already seen the film before they could even
breath a single word to me, also staying away from the reviews on here
so i don&#x27;t find anything out which was really frustrating.<br /><br />But in all fair play this film definitely delivered my taste to this
amazing storyline, the writer/director is doing a fantastic job on
keeping this films as close to the game as possible. Mean like resident
evil 1 is based on 1 with Alice being involved which doesn&#x27;t happen in
the game but o well scratch that shall we, number two has a mix with
number 2 and 3, extinction i felt went in its own path showing a
different aspect to these sorta films being based all in daylight
shooting which you rarely see in zombie films.<br /><br />Now this instalment to the films has its own way on playing but has
sticked to the new resident evil 5 (my favourite in the series)besides
being shot in south Africa. But keeping u with the new infected zombies
and also adding the person behind everything with umbrella.<br /><br />I felt they chucked in a lot of off different aspects to this part,
with it being shot in a costophobic way and also being shot in day and
night. The action involved here as well was crystal nothing too over
the top besides a bit too much slow-mo but hey we can all deal with
that. More scarier and more jump scenes as well which i can come to
terms no other resident evil has every chucked so many into.<br /><br />all in all i loved this chapter to this series.<br /><br />the only downside to me was the ending for one being as i was waiting
through out the whole film see the return off Jill valentine and when i
did i was like why why why. knowing i love the films i think it could
off ended on this one because the director better do the 5 instalment
and he has to really pull all the stops out to over do this one. Also
the last thing is i felt it was a bit too long (longert then the last
three i felt) but thats my only complaint.
