I loved every moment of it, I&#x27;m a fan of Milla and I&#x27;ve seen most of
her movies, even the terrible ones, and I have followed the Resident
Evil franchise since the first movie, my favorite was the second one
for it had the most action...<br /><br />but now I absolutely love the 4th one! It has so much action and fun!
The 3D is the best I&#x27;ve seen (along with Avatar) and nothing like the
crappy conversions done to Clash of the titans and Alice in wonderland.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure there are whinny little haters on the franchise, but they need
to take a seat because this movie is solid.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful and the visuals are stunning, you can
definitely tell they invested a whole lot more money and time on it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun kick ass action/adventure with horror in
it this is your movie! Best action I&#x27;ve seen in years!
