Hey it&#x27;s TVGuy3, and sadly this is the only movie I&#x27;ll be reviewing
this week, since my cousin said the Virginity Hit is a big steaming
pile of trash. Anyway, I was a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise
ever since it came out on PlayStation. The first movie was a great
shocker, the second almost rivaling the first, and the third was
showing signs of decline. Now with Afterlife, the fourth installment, I
was just looking for a popcorn movie. And it is. But the first three
all also functioned as real horror movies. This one is just slashing
and shooting. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a really capable slashing and
shooting and Milla Jovovich gives a great performance, but this movie
honestly needed more plot. Or a new director. Paul W.S. Anderson is not
a good director. Let&#x27;s just get that out of the way. The thing the
first three movies were lacking was good direction. Luckily, the script
and the acting were good enough to scare us. But like I said before,
the script and acting is just slashing and shooting, which makes the
bad direction even more visible. If you&#x27;re not a fan of the franchise,
this is a good horror flick. But if you&#x27;re a fan of the first three,
don&#x27;t waste your money and be disappointed. If you want slashing and
shooting with a real plot, go see Machete. Not this.
