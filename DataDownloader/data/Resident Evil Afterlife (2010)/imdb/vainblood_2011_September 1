There has been a lot of bashing on this movie because some of the
scenes doesn&#x27;t make sense and I have to agree to an extent. They make
sense but we have to remember that this is a supernatural action movie
based on a video game, so you have to keep an open mind and find your
own explanations outside of the script, like in so many other movies.<br /><br />This is actually one of the best movies I&#x27;ve seen based on a game, with
only Silent Hill as a competitor. I guess horror games make it big on
the screen these days. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the games but I&#x27;ve played
them and I have to say I enjoyed the movies more. <br /><br />The story is a bit thin but in this movie the focus is on intense
fights, suspense and beautiful choreography. There is never a boring
moment and Milla brings a lot of depth to her character. She is so
awesome in this role, that you could almost think it was personally
written for her. She has the sort of killer gaze that would freeze any
man in his step. The other characters are also well played with actors
that fit the role well. As frosting on the cake, you get a solid
soundtrack that does well to make the scenes as dramatic as they could
be.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that this movie is just an extension of the
fight with Umbrella Corporation and even if they have tried to be
creative there is still more of the same. You will probably recognize
some things from other movies, like James Bond and the Matrix but all
movies can be compared to another and this movie still has it&#x27;s
original parts.
