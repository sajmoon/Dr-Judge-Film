Had the potential to be a good film I&#x27;m a fan of the games and the
previous films I had some beef with but not that much but this put
simply is boke and I blame Paul W.S Anderson. No plot, serious lack of
character development (which is very annoying considering its Chris
Redfields 1st appearance in film franchise), continuity errors galore,
plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon, Hollywood jobbers IE people
who have no point other than no get killed taking up excess screen
time, no plot oooo and did I mention no plot. Watse of time only
redeeming feature is Milla Jovovich and tbh looking at the performance
I think even she said this is a waste of my time.
