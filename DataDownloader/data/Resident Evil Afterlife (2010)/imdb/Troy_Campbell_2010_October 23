This fourth Resident Evil instalment was only ever going to be worth
seeing if it featured lots of amusing gore and entertaining action
scenes that utilised the third dimension successfully. Evidently,
director Anderson must&#x27;ve known this too, because nary a second is
wasted on anything else. From the get go we&#x27;re embroiled in a mass raid
on Umbrella&#x27;s high-tech underground headquarters by dozens of Alice
replicates. It&#x27;s Matrix-y slick, features a massive body count and is a
great way to kick off proceedings, even if the CGI is occasionally
substandard.<br /><br />The remainder of the film becomes grubbier once it relocates to an
abandoned maximum security prison surrounded by thousands of the
&#x22;infected&#x22;. Alice, and the ragtag bunch of Los Angeleno&#x27;s she meets in
the jail, encounter blood-thirsty zombies left, right and centre with
murderous glee. The finest sequence on offer comes thanks to the
inexplicably nonsensical inclusion of an unnamed 10ft creature with a
mammoth axe-like weapon, who was apparently only introduced so we could
witness its gruesome demise. With rain-drenched slow motion and heart
pounding music, watching Alice and Claire despatch of this demented
beast is a thrill.<br /><br />To mention other dispensable elements of this movie &#x96; you know, acting,
character development, dialogue, plot plausibility, etc &#x96; would be
redundant for two reasons, (a) because your enjoyment of Afterlife can
be measured wholly on your reaction to the above couple of paragraphs
and (b) we all know that the aforementioned filmic elements will be
close to non-existent anyhow.<br /><br />Mindless fun.<br /><br />3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 -
Classic)
