I&#x27;m a fan of the series and I want to be as objective as possible, but
the first fifteen minutes is a complete rip off of The Matrix - which
was eleven years ago. Yep, believe it or not, it has been eleven years
since The Matrix. And this movie has all the same slow motion &#x27;bullet
time&#x27; effects, same type of outfits, etc... I&#x27;ve tried to watch this
movie three times, but I can&#x27;t get past the first thirty minutes. If
you&#x27;re a younger viewer that likes this movie and has not seen The
Matrix, you should watch it - I think you&#x27;ll see what I mean. There are
not many movies I would care to comment on, but since I am a fan of the
series I just wanted to express my disappointment in this installment.
