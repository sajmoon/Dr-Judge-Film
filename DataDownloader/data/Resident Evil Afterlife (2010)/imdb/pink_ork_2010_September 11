Wesker was neat before and I would have loved to see him killing Alice.<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, Lets play a game. When you have a group when
2/3 are main characters; who do you think is going to die? BUT they did
keep the insane black guy alive....though nearly killing him off. I
think they put him in just to say &#x22;Hey, see everyone can jump that high
and bad*ss! It not that we God-Moded Alice even when she is supposed to
be human again! EVERYONE can do it!&#x22;<br /><br />It deserved a one for all intensify purposes; but it did have Wesker
beating the sh*t out of Alice....so its propped up to 2. Of course this
was before the messed up everything about Wesker and copied an entire
fight scene directly from the fifth game.
