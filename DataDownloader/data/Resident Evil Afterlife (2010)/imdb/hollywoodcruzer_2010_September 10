To everyone that reads this, please go see this movie in 3D. It costs
more, but is worth it.<br /><br />I have seen Avatar twice in 3D, and now Resident Evil, and this movie
blows Avatar away like only Alice can do. There aren&#x27;t many movies that
have made me want to write a review as soon as I got home from it, but
this one is so good I needed to write something, just to express how
much I liked it.<br /><br />I am not going to give any kind of spoiler, but if you liked the other
3 movies you will love this one just as much or more. Maybe the 3D
experience adds to the fun, but the movie was great in itself too. Lots
of action and explosions. And Milla is hot!!<br /><br />So, if you must search through your couch for a few extra Quarters, it
is well worth the time and money to see this movie.
