2010_September 24 
For me it was a total failure... watched the entire series- all others
make sense- this one do not have a logical course, the girl loses her
powers but she can still take hits no human being can, she still defies
the laws of physics in fights even though she is supposed to be a
simple human now- erase the beginning and you won&#x27;t even notice she is
actually an ordinary human being. For me at least left the impression
of a movie made extremely fast and without a minimum attention to
details- just for commercial reasons, unlike it&#x27;s predecessors which I
really enjoyed. It has a ranking of 1 star from me as a punishment for
not at least trying to keep the standards imposed by the first movies
in the series.
