Firstly, i&#x27;d like to explain why i rated this movie at 3 stars and not
ZERO: &#x27;cause it&#x27;s really visually impressive, credit where credit&#x27;s
due. Just eye candy, from first to last minute. HOWEVER, that&#x27;s all
there is to it, as with many sci-fi wannabe hit movies, but with a
sinister twist to it: absolutely no cohesion (visual progression/sets
and general story-telling included).<br /><br />This movie would have generated 20 or 30 good trailers, as long as 2-3
min snippets were kept separate and no one actually watched the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, this is the movie that most boldly assumes the Matrix Trilogy
has been either forgotten or remained unwatched by a younger
generation. While i applaud the liberty taken to re-shoot bullet
dodging scenes and &#x22;bullet time&#x22;, maybe as an attempt to break the
monopoly of the famed -now classic- Trilogy over it, it deeply disgusts
me that even the wardrobe is spoofed. Wardrobe, some superpowers, some
character development, camera angles and general scene perspective,
CGI, the pace of the action, excessive similarity of quite a few scenes
(!?), fight-scenes and concepts, self-cloning characters, and even a
non-neutral hue throughout most of the movie which gets situationally
changed (as in The Trilogy and its greenish hue).<br /><br />So, this movie isn&#x27;t really a collection of clich&#xE9;s as some reviewers
have said. It&#x27;s one single giant
Matrix-spoof-turned-part-of-a-franchise thing. Really, no one has ever
copied it so boldly (or with such a straight face) before. Too bad that
being uncreative and sleazily plagiarizing does not a good movie make.
