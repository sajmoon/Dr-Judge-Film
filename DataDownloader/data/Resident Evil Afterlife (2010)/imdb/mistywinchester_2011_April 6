Great movie, but It not like the original.Good story and action so I
say a great movie to watch.The action is awesome and the zombies are
great as ever.Alice is the hero again trying to save some people who
got traped because of them.Many things are right with these movie.Not
as good as the original resident evil but just as good watch.IF you
want action and zombies you got yourself a great movie to enjoy again
and again.I recommend that you watch all of the resident evil
movies.And there&#x27;s a great surprise at the end when a character comes
back.A kick butt movie and great movie to rent or buy.Alice is great
character to watch and see how she evolves.
