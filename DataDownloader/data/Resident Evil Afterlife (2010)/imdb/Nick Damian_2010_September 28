OK...<br /><br />The story that starts and never wants to end.<br /><br />As much as I like the series...it&#x27;s the same story - over and over..<br /><br />Zombies - zombies and more zombies.<br /><br />How much of a plot can be done with zombies? Really? Whether it&#x27;s this
movie or the others before this or any other zombie movie...they are
basically all the same after 20 minutes in.<br /><br />The only reason I like this series is because of Milla...and maybe
that&#x27;s the only reason it keeps being made...<br /><br />...but really....there is no real diversion from this story at all to
any great extent and maybe there should be sometime.<br /><br />This is eye candy and mindless entertainment...with little focus on
entertainment, but plenty on effects.<br /><br />Seriously. I lived in Toronto for 20 years or so and if I can&#x27;t
recognize a single building or location, then there is far too much
green screen and CGI.<br /><br />When there is too many effects, little story and no logic, why make
another one?<br /><br />Even if you change the lead cast...the story is still the same...as
long as you have zombies and people that don&#x27;t die...you can only go so
far.<br /><br />This story won&#x27;t end...
