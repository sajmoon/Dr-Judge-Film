Sheer disappointment! This is surely the weakest Resident Evil movie in
the series. Although we still have the ruthless Umbrella corporation
and the undead here chasing the survivors, their characterisation also
left much to be desired.<br /><br />The only thing which was and still goes good for the series is Milla
Jovovich. That&#x27;s unfortunate because how much of the movie&#x27;s success
can she carry on her sexy shoulders :) Yes, she still looks smokin&#x27; hot
and ably kicks b***. She also gets nice support from Ali Larter
although you don&#x27;t miss anything if you&#x27;d replace her with anyone else
:) Seriously, I think Larter&#x27;s better off in negative, villain roles
than just being a side support. And except for Albert Wesker(head of
Umbrella) who was effectively menacing in his act, we can forget the
rest of the cast.<br /><br />Even if we were to include the good visual effects and the action
choreography, they don&#x27;t help much to mask the mediocrity of Afterlife.
Which is sad because I really like Paul Anderson&#x27;s first in the series.
That was quite scary &#x26; memorable. The second in the series was good
too. The third wobbled a bit but this one just crashed! So I guess Paul
should stop making any more REs unless there&#x27;s a complete makeover in
the writing, direction and casting(except for Milla Jovovich)<br /><br />Verdict: Hardly much life in the movie, forget Afterlife! Chuck it.
