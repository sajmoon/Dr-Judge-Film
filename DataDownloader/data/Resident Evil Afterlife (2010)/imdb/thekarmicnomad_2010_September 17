The Resident Evil films have been on a long slide downhill since the
stylish first movie. But that is expected.<br /><br />What spoiled the film for me was the awful 3D. I am not a 3d fan to
begin with but this was just terrible.<br /><br />While mega action is going on you are distracted by shell cases and
masonry flying at you, when you glance back to screen the zombies are
all dead and Mila is moving on. The shots from the air looked like
someone holding an airfix plane in front of a poster. The gratuitous
shots of double pistols pointing down the screen were cartoonish and
over used. Token pieces of furniture were projected 3d so it looked
like the actors were in a drama studio with a backdrop and a couple of
props stage front.<br /><br />About a third of the film is shot using compound camera trickery.
Anytime someone as much as asks to pass the mustard everything slows
down to bullet time and a random object looms out the screen at you.<br /><br />The plot, acting etc. are all negligible, the film is at least a
thousand times cheesier than the first; but what do you expect? I look
forward to getting my hands on the 2d DVD.
