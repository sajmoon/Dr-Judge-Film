The Bad: When I say improbabilities, I mean improbabilities. There&#x27;s a
part about fifteen minutes in when Alice and Wesker crash a plane
headfirst into a mountain and minutes later she walks out of the
wreckage mildly burned with a limp. Now, Wesker has powers now so I can
accept him surviving. She&#x27;s human. If you can buy that, the sky&#x27;s the
limit. Other problems include Wentworth Miller, who was doing his best
Christian Bale impression the whole time and the guy who played Wesker
was pretty bad, too. I could see that guy being a memorable villain,
but it was kind of ruined by the performance and an anticlimactic, but
cool looking, end fight.<br /><br />The Good: This series is very much one of those that, while it is very
different to the game, they are still fun movies. For that, I put this
series up with some of the better video game movies that we have, not
that that&#x27;s saying much. I mean, look what it&#x27;s going up against. And
for those of you who want these things to be more faithful to the
games, this is the most faithful one so far. The action scenes, while
indeed stealing heavily in some parts, are really fun and the rest of
the acting isn&#x27;t as bad as it could have been. I&#x27;ve read some reviews
where the critic was bothered by the sudden and unexplained appearance
of the Executioner/Axe Man. This is different from the video games and
previous movies how? It&#x27;s the Resident Evil movie. You kill these
bosses and you just move on from there. I don&#x27;t want a whole back story
on a guy who only appears for about fifteen-twenty minutes.<br /><br />Now, if you like the other three films, go ahead and see this one. If
you didn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;re reading this review because
this most certainly is not going to redeem it.<br /><br />8/10
