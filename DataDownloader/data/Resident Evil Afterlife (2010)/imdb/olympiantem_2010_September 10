I recently got a chance to watch Resident Evil: Afterlife with a couple
of friends at a local theatre. The first three movies didn&#x27;t give me
that much to expect for the fourth installment, either way, I was very
excited. I came out completely blown away. It was high octane thrilling
action at its best.<br /><br />Some movies (e.g. Airbender) used the magic of 3D to great waste. But
to tell you, Resident Evil 4 was absolutely amazing in 3D and surround
sound. Never before had I got to witness Milla Jovovich blowing zombies
away in 3D. It was a whole new experience and the first of its genre to
be in 3D. I thought it was used amazingly.<br /><br />There were many jump scares which I didn&#x27;t mind, the 4 mouthed zombie&#x27;s
looked awesome and the normal zombie&#x27;s look also very freaky in 3D as
well as the Axeman whose feet shaked the very floor of the theater. But
the best scene for me was definitely the final battle with Wesker,
complete with suspenseful rock music accompanied in which accompanied
the epic battle. We&#x27;ve been waiting for almost 3 movies to see his head
blown out into bits by Jovovich. I&#x27;ll leave you to see yourself if he
makes it out alive.<br /><br />Overall it was a great movie, not for kids, so do yourself a wonderful
favour, run to your local theater and buy yourself a ticket for
Resident Evil: Afterlife in 3D.<br /><br />P.S. Stay a few minutes into the credits. Video game fans wont be
disappointed
