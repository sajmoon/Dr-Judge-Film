By now people should already know that when you go see a resident evil
movie there is going to be shooting, some major ass kicking, glorious
explosions (especially the Tokyo one in Afterlife stands out),
monsters, zombies, cheesy dialog (which in my opinion only ads to
greatness of this series) and of course, the gorgeous miss Jovovich.
Also in this movie franchise.. a lot of times we are shown stuff that
is explained a lot later.. maybe even two movies later. Like the
Majinis and the Executioner, who show up in L.A. for no reason.. Maybe
we&#x27;ll find out in the fifth installment.<br /><br />Let me just say that i am a BIG fan of the RE games, especially 4 and
5, which have taken another direction with the storyline (for the
better), but i also like the movies. I&#x27;m that kind of a person who
enjoys all aspects of movies, music, art and almost everything else in
life. I look at, listen to and watch any genre you throw at me, as long
as the product is good in its own way. If you are like me, you&#x27;re going
to enjoy this movie even if you aren&#x27;t an action fan.. oh and
definitely see it in 3D.<br /><br />GL
