Ill start by stating i am a resident evil fan, but not of the movies,
of the games, and having played the fifth game i know what is going on
(sort of) but what about the people who have only watched the movies. I
took my girlfriend along to see this and she was confused as all hell
when we came out. At one point i remember her asking &#x22;whats with the
giant dude with the axe?&#x22; and it made me think, why haven&#x27;t the
directors/screenwriters explained ANYTHING? people who haven&#x27;t played
the games don&#x27;t know where the hell the majini came from, or even what
they are called, only that they are &#x27;zombies&#x27; with tentacles coming out
of their mouths. and no one else seems to get why wesker is the way he
is unless you&#x27;ve played the games. on another point, i don&#x27;t know where
the hell the majini came from in this film, they are just there!! OK
more ramblings, this time from a lover of film and not the games. The
plot is terrible, there is no explanation (as i have already stated)
and the acting was absolutely atrocious. the only person who carried
their character properly was Ali larter playing claire. also, the
casting for the new characters was terrible as well. Wentworth Miller
playing chris redfield?????? what were they thinking, also Shawn
Roberts who played wesker carried the character terribly, he well
overdid it.<br /><br />OK the good points, the flashiness worked, sort of, but i did have to
turn a blind eye to EVERYTHING else but the stylised violence and the
endless references to the fifth games enemies (which made no sense in
terms of the plot of the movie but it was cool as a fan to see majini
and the executioner in the film) and the fight between wesker, chris,
and claire was kinda cool (if you overlook the fact that they have used
the exact same choreography as one particular fight scene in the fifth
game) and these are the reasons i have given it a much as a 5. purely
cause it looked kinda cool
