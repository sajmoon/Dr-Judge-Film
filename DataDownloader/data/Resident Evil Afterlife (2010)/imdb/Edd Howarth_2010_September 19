In a series that deals with viral mutations, it&#x27;s pretty fitting that
the fourth Resident Evil, a film that found its roots in the sort of
humble zombie/ mad scientist territory, is practically mutated beyond
recognition. And when is mutation ever really a good thing? After a
devastating zombie plague hits humanity, rogue survivor/ superhuman
Alice (Milla Jovovich) roams the globe seeking those responsible: the
evil Umbrella corporation. This time, the search takes her to LA, where
she finds other survivors holed up in a prison, and a mysterious
safe-haven called Arcadia.<br /><br />Told like a story translated into French, Japanese, back to English,
and finally into GGAAAAKEEERFLLLAAARGH, Afterlife is a bloody patchwork
of action movie clich&#xE9;s, clunky dialog, and more slow motion than you
can shake a clock at. There&#x27;s also a villain so villainous he wears
dark glasses inside. INSIDE.<br /><br />The whole thing plays out like a video recording of a theme park ride,
and if we were to defend Afterlife at all, it would be that its 3D
appeal does make it sort of like a ride, so much so that watching it in
any other dimension is a weirdly unfocused experience that falls (get
ready for it) flat. Slow-mo rubble sails unimpressively across the
screen. Slow-mo bullets sort of come toward you. Oh, and did we mention
the slow mo? But all these hilarious jokes aside, it&#x27;s a shoddy, lazy
and repetitive film that treats the audience like we don&#x27;t have brains,
but are just hungry for them.
