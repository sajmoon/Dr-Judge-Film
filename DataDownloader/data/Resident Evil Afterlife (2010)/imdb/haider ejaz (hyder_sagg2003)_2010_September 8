I am not a very big fan of RE but my younger brother.... OMG he is so
mad after this movie and some times he even looks weird. I have seen
Resident Evil 1, that was fine and interesting, Part two was pretty
uninteresting and story was poor... Extinction was better (I didn&#x27;t see
it completely) and I liked it better than RE2.<br /><br />But part 4 is pretty good, 3D works here, visuals and cinematography
are best part of the movie and editing is good but its very better than
Part 2 &#x26; 3....<br /><br />Story in kind of different and better, Actually very better... Part 2
was worst in the series but 4 seems close to the part 1.<br /><br />In short its a good movie and Its not what you are expecting its really
better. You won&#x27;t regret ....
