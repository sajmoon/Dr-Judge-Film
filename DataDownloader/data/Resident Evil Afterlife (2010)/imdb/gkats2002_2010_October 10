If After.... this fourth installment of the series, they make another
one, I am surely to not watch this. As much as I enjoyed watching the
first movie, and even the other two of the series, this one surely
makes the worse of the four.<br /><br />Shot specifically to sell out as a 3D movie (and especially in Greece
where I live they have this bad habit of translating the movie titles
in whatever they think suits them, so the title was changed to Resident
Evil: three dimensional escape!!!!!!! ), it doesn&#x27;t even succeed in
that. Silly action scenes, to facilitate the use of 3D, many clich&#xE9;s
and non-existent dialog is what makes this film a total rubbish.<br /><br />There is so much exaggerating in this movie, that you just can&#x27;t have
any more. And there are times that it looks so bad, that it makes you
wanna stop watching it.<br /><br />Too bad, because they cold make so much more from this franchise, if
they really out some effort in it. I wont go into details, it isn&#x27;t
worth it. But have in mind, that there are better movies out there to
watch, than this piece of nothingness!!!!
