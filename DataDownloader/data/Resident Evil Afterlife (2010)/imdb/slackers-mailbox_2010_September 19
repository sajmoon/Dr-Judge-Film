..or just six years old. This movie is so full of *beep* i don&#x27;t even
know where to begin with. The opening scene, starring a bunch of cloned
ninja-sword wielding bitches. The helicopter crash.. seriously.. WTF?
The permanent Matrix-style slow-mo scenes. The ultimately lame &#x22;story&#x22;
or the god awful and annoying music. The 3D effects were the only good
thing in this movie, but still couldn&#x27;t save it from being utter trash. <br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie would have been a naked Milla
Jovowitch. Unfortunately, there is no naked Milla in it.<br /><br />This movie get&#x27;s a solid one from me. You&#x27;re better off playing the
video game, or watching your neighbors dog licking it&#x27;s ass.
