This film is like a poor man&#x27;s MATRIX at times. Some of the scenes were
such a rip-off I had to stop myself laughing out loud, it was
EMBARRASSING! Unfortunately, the film is NOT a comedy, it&#x27;s not a
horror either. In fact, neither is it a thriller. It&#x27;s basically pi$$
poor.<br /><br />The storyline was poor, when not incomprehensible &#x26; I&#x27;m not quite sure
why I stayed until the end.<br /><br />However, thankfully, I have now forgotten how it ended anyway.... So
now, on with the rest of my life, to try &#x26; forget the rest of this
film.<br /><br />Wish me Luck!
