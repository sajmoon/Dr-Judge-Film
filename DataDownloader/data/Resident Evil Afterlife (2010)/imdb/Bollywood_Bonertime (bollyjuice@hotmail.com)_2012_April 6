From the first minute to the end of the credits, this movie is a zombie
movie lover&#x27;s fantasy. Imagine crossing Shaun of the Dead and Kung Fu
Hustle and you&#x27;ll have a small idea of what kind of movie you&#x27;re in for
when you watch Resident Evil: Afterlife.<br /><br />I scour the world of film to find movies that stand out to me as being
worthy of owning. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to movies, and I&#x27;ve seen
many films that fall into the &#x22;zombie&#x22; category which end up being
nothing short of wasted time in my life once I reach the ending. I am
not a fan of Shaun of the Dead simply because it only is a comedy, as
it mocks the entire genre of horror movies and zombie flicks. Resident
Evil: Afterlife is much the same in the way that you try to open your
mind to it and wonder how long it will be before you can accept it&#x27;s
another sorry zombie movie, before you realize that you&#x27;re laughing
hysterically aloud at flying heads and spurting blood.<br /><br />I have no idea how the first reviewer can think that this is the most
scary movie ever??? The plot sucks and has more holes than a moth-eaten
sock. The zombies don&#x27;t follow normal rules of engagement and the film
just substitutes gore for true well written horror. Imagine zombies
being killed by a newly deceased spirit and people being possessed and
killing themselves. Zombies specialized in exorcising just die by
strangulation! That is ridiculous. Guys, don&#x27;t watch this one. Its not
worth the time at all! I hope this review and my comments have helped
you make your decision about this movie.
