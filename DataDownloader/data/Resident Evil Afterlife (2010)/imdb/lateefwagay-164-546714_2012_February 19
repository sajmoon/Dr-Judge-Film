I recently saw this movie,this sequel is really a bad stain on it&#x27;s
previous one&#x27;s.What is the storyline of the movie is that Milla
Jovovich is again on the mission to save the people from that deadly
virus.Nothing new is seen in the movie,really poor concept.<br /><br />I really expected a lot from this movie,but it disappointed me and i
think i have wasted my money to watch this in the theater.Look at the
Milla,she is giving her 100% but what is really lacking is the good
concept.Action&#x27;s were good to watch by Milla but we can&#x27;t compare it
with previous sequels.<br /><br />In my opinion it is waste of money to watch this movie and nothing
else.My vote for this movie is 3/10.
