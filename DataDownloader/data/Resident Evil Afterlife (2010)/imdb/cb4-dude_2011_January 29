In the last couple of weeks, I re-watched the series of these movies.
If you rated any below an 8, then shooting, explosions, and blowing the
heads of the Undead is really not your type of movie. Just stick to 50
first dates and you will be fine.<br /><br />I am pretty sure these movies are guy movies. I am not sure a woman
could like these to the same extent, and if you are a woman and do,
CALL ME!!! HA HA.<br /><br />Of course they don&#x27;t have a masterpiece of a story line, of course they
stretch reality. THAT IS WHAT A GOOD ACTION MOVIE DOES!!! HELLO!! It is
97 minutes of entertainment. That&#x27;s it. You don&#x27;t get lost thinking
about the plot or nuances in the plot. You sit back and watch this
attractive leading lady avoid getting chomped on by flesh hungry
mutants. Come on people, they aren&#x27;t shooting for an Oscar here. If you
want that, find something else to watch that is probably dull, boring,
and quite pretentious.<br /><br />So grab a beer, a bag of chips and turn up that damn surround sound for
a hell of an entertaining movie!!
