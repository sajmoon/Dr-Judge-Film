The problem I find with this fourth instalment of the Resident Evil
franchise is that it seems to have by-passed any form of depth, while
not expecting too much in the way of a story at least, this Afterlife
addition has solely concentrated on its 3D gimmick to sell its point.<br /><br />There seems to be a trend of the visual over any hardcore narrative.
What we have here is 3D overdrive enhancing the form and actions of Ms.
Milla Jovovich, and it&#x27;s as basic as that.<br /><br />The characters are the average one-dimensional throwaways that are
placed on screen as walking clich&#xE9;s, adding too, that when it comes to
any threat from this franchise&#x27;s walking dead themselves they are no
longer required to project tension or threat. These poor souls, too, no
longer require top billing and it is they who are reliant on this
latest technology rather than the 3-D needing the horror of the undead
to keep the gravy train rolling.<br /><br />This, again, is not about the old days of walking dead horror but
Alice&#x27;s new image as 3D dolly bird and her quest to do slow-mo action
and the old chestnut of bullet-time once again raises its ugly head.
With this latest fad comes old ideas to exploit and it&#x27;s all so tiring. <br /><br />All this and the nondescript script, too, that makes the fourth
instalment a seemingly pointless exercise in the life of Alice and her
wonderland. Her part in the franchise of the new technology of
three-dimensional theatre is ever evident when the visual dimension
supersedes the dimension of the three fundamental traits that make a
good film: script, plot and narrative.
