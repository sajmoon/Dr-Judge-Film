At this point in the franchise, I have to ask, who is still watching
the Resident Evil movies that actually enjoys them? Does anyone glean
any excitement, interest or just plain, simple entertainment value from
these films? Because, based on what is on display in Resident Evil:
Afterlife, unless you are interested in watching a stream of unexciting
action sequences with little or no grounding in reality, you will
mostly likely walk away from the film with nothing but a feeling of
derision.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife picks up where the last entry, Resident Evil:
Extinction, ended, with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her endless stream
of clones assaulting the Japanese headquarters of the Umbrella
Corporation, who have caused the majority of the world&#x27;s population to
be transformed into flesh eating zombies (I hate it when that happens).
After bringing down the head of this particular unit, Albert Wesker
(Shawn Roberts, one of the worst actors I have seen in some time),
Alice travels to Alaska to meet up with a group of survivors led by
Claire (Ali Larter). However, she finds only Claire still there, and
Claire&#x27;s memories are gone and she has a device resembling a beetle
attached to her chest that is causing both her memory loss and some
rather anti-social behavior. Alice and Claire decide to fly down the
coast in search of other survivors, finding a group holed up in a
prison outside L.A., comprised, among others, of Luther (Boris Kodjoe),
Hollywood producer Bennet (Kim Coates), and Claire&#x27;s brother, Chris
(Wentworth Miller). The group must try to escape the legions of the
undead surrounding the prison and reach a large tanker ship off the
coast that represents their only hope for survival.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife is a film that exists for one purpose and one
purpose only: to string together fight after fight, shootout after
shootout, all of them choreographed and photographed with various slick
camera techniques that should, I suppose, raise your pulse. That is all
the film even attempts to accomplish, because it doesn&#x27;t really try to
do anything else. The story, what there is of one, is both barely an
afterthought and mostly cribbed from other zombie movies, such as Night
of the Living Dead. Afterlife isn&#x27;t even trying to be a horror film
anymore, which its predecessors weren&#x27;t really accomplished at, but
gave a passing thought to the concept. This is an action movie, through
and through, but since the characters are basically non-entities, there
is nobody to root for, so all you are doing is watching bodies and
objects in motion, with nothing to give any additional depth to any of
the proceedings.<br /><br />The acting is mostly a non-issue, because the people on screen are
there simply to shoot guns or get knocked off in various zombie
attacks. When any of the characters get killed, there isn&#x27;t even a
moment&#x27;s thought as to their well-being; they are cardboard cutouts,
not people. The film introduces Chris as Claire&#x27;s brother, but that
plot development is as pointless as any other in the film, because
other than the briefest exchange of dialogue to establish this fact, it
serves absolutely no purpose to the story or to the characters. The
film does itself an even greater disservice by casting Roberts in the
role of the villain, because you would swear they just plucked a random
body off the street, not actually went through the process of hiring
someone who claims to be an actor, as Robert&#x27;s performance is akin to
someone reading text off a teleprompter. How can the audience root
against someone who is so lifeless, without even an iota of energy?<br /><br />Are the action sequences cool looking? Sure, but nothing so impressive
to make your forget films such as The Matrix where some of the
techniques and images were obviously lifted from. And without any
feeling to proceedings, there is nothing for you to invest in. There is
no suspense, no excitement, no horror, no nothing to Afterlife. It just
is, sitting there looking pretty, and isn&#x27;t even afforded the decency
of a real ending, just some scenes serving as a potential setup for yet
another Resident Evil movie. And, as I started off this review, is
there any audience that really wants another one? Is there someone
waiting, clamoring for yet another Resident Evil film? I find it hard
to believe.
