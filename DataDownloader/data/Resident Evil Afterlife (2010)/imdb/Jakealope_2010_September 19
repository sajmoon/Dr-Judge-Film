Okay, you all probably know the scenario now as Alice battles the
undead and the Umbrella Corporation on a wasted post apocalypse earth.
It starts out with a massive amount of CGI as Alice and clones storm
the Tokyo HQ of U.C. The gals cut down swarms of Japanese guards with
throwing stars, samurai swords, machine guns, bombs etc, all in state
of the art CGI and 3 D with lot&#x27;s of Matrix ripoff thrown in.<br /><br />Then the head honcho of U.C., Albert Wexler, all T-virused out with red
eyes, shoots Alice up with the cure with a hypo in her neck, so Alice
becomes human again in his VTOL escape plane. She thanks him for that,
just before the plane crashes into the side of a mountain, you&#x27;d think
they would have a better autopilot than that. That crash was frozen in
space as everything inside the fuselage continued forward ala Newton&#x27;s
Law, but since Alice is now human, one would think she would have been
crushed and burned, along with super Wexler.<br /><br />But in the next scene she is piloting a single engine plane over
Alaska, no mean feat crossing the Pacific non stop, looking for
Arcadia, the promised land from the last movie. No dice, instead of the
promised land, she finds a runway full of empty planes and some doped
up crazed Claire Redfield, almost a zombie due to some creepy
mechanical spider full of some drug attached to her chest. So after
Claire is subdued, they are back in that little plane, which seems to
have unlimited range. and flying south to good old LA, which anyone
would guess is the nexus of disaster as in every end of the world movie
ever made. They land on top of an urban high rise prison full of
various survivors in a daring rooftop, gravity &#x26; reality defying
landing where they meet some fellow survivors.<br /><br />Okay, Arcadia is not a town, it is a ship, some huge cargo one, which
happens to be in L.A. harbor but there is a horde of zombies separating
the &#x22;prisoners&#x22; from &#x22;safety&#x22; I won&#x27;t go on too much more except to say
there is the usual stunts and laws of Physics defying tricks by Alice &#x26;
Claire. Even though supposedly Alice lost all her super abilities,
you&#x27;d never guess by her endless super stunts. Or her matched sawed off
double barrel shotguns that she loads coins, bigger than the bore, to
make them super guns.<br /><br />You get pretty much a bunch of cool special effects, the usual twists
and characters you&#x27;d expect as well as an ending left open for the
sequel. No one is expecting a masterpiece or great acting and dialog,
but if gives you what you expect and more if you are familiar with the
last 3.
