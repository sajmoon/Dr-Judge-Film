Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones tries to kill Albert Webster
(Shawn Roberts) from the Umbrella Coporation in his base at Japan. But
Alice and her clones failed the mission. Now Alice is trying to find
the survivors safe haven known as &#x22;Arcadia&#x22; in Alaska. Which her
friends went there for help but once she arrives, she finds no one
there but Claire (Ali Larter), who lost her memory and she seemed to be
control by a device on her chest made from Umbrella Coporation. Now
Alice goes to Los Angeles to find any survivors along with Claire. They
find some survivors (Wentworth Miller, Boris Kodjoe, Kim Coates, Kacey
Barnfield, Norman Yeung, Sergio Peris-Mencheta and Fulvio Cecere)
living in a Maximum Security Prison. Alice finds out from the the
survivors that &#x22;Arcadia&#x22; is actually a cargo tanker travelling along
the coast. Which Alice, Claire and the survivors are very close to
&#x22;Arcadia&#x22; but having trouble how to get there. While new mutations from
Umbrella Coporation are trying to kill the remaining survivors by
somehow getting into the prison. Which the group of survivors have to
find an new way to get to &#x22;Arcadia&#x22; and helping each other to survive.<br /><br />Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator, Death
Race, Event Horizon) made an entertaining, action, sci-fi/horror third
sequel to the profitable &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; series, which (obviously) is
based on a popular video game. Jovovich is game as always in the movie.
While Larter, Miller and Kodjoe are fine in their roles. While Roberts
certainly having fun with his role. This time, Writer and
Director:Anderson certainly takes his premise more seriously this time
around. Although it doesn&#x27;t stop Anderson increasing his visual style
by giving tribute to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; and two John Carpenter films like
&#x22;Escape from New York&#x22; (Which for some reason an few of the prison
sequences reminded me a lot of that movie) and &#x22;The Thing&#x22;.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Anderson is planning &#x22;Resident Evil 5&#x22; and
probably &#x22;Resident Evil 6&#x22;. Hopefully, if Anderson has an few more
tricks up his sleeve. For sure, the future sequels of &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22;
should be good. I seen this movie only on the regular 2-D version. The
movie looked good, despite some very obvious 3-D moments. &#x22;Resident
Evil:Afterlife&#x22; is certainly an improvement over the semi-lame/mess
&#x22;Resident Evil:Apocalyspe&#x22; and reasonably entertaining &#x22;Resident
Evil:Extinction&#x22;. Perphas not much Zombie action for some tastes. If
you enjoy the games or better yet, the &#x22;RE&#x22; series, you will be
entertained. Good music score by tomandandy (The Hills Have Eyes
&#x22;2006&#x22;, The Rules of Attraction, The Strangers). Super 35.
