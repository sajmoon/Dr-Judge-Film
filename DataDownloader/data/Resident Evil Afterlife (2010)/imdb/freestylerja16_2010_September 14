We can expect more from the guy who directed Event Horizon. When I
watch movies, I take them in for what they are, so I&#x27;m not going to
compare Resident Evil to American Beauty or Mystic River. However, I
can compare it to The Dark Knight, Doomsday, and Kickass, which are
decent action movies with really well done action sequences and
imagination. The Action in Resident Evil is really exaggerated; as in
they try to make a whole lot of nothing into something. Like when
Wesker is dodging bullets, hes just kind of standing there making
retarded faces. My friend expected this to be a bad Resident Evil movie
which most fans(those who loved the first three games, and Code
Veronica) will expect, but this was just a bad movie. Nothing was
explained, just shown to look bad ass. The characters are bullshit and
clich&#xE9;, and Chris&#x27;s situation when you are introduced to him doesn&#x27;t
make any sense. Finally the most disappointing aspect of the movie was
the action, they don&#x27;t even really shoot them in the head anymore to
kill the zombies, it&#x27;s just shooting, and looking bad ass. Also the
hand to hand fighting wasn&#x27;t impressive, The Matrix, which was created
over a decade ago, Kickass, Doomsday, Batman, Spiderman, Watchmen, V
for Vendetta, THE EXPENDABLES, and every Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie(Including Jingle all the way) have more enticing action scenes.
However, the helicopters do look really bad ass, which is why I give
this a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 out of 10.
