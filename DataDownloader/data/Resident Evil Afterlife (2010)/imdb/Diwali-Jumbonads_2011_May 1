It has a couple of saving graces but generally is just bad. It begins
with some reasonably well done flashbacks that show the background of
the current situation. There is some treachery, some decent fighting
and the sudden appearance of a female monk to save the day--or at least
saves the lives of the protagonists when they were children. The next
acceptable scene features Alice, showing some MATRIX style kung fu and
pistol moves to a not very enthusiastic audience&#x97;she really sells the
moves. I know that the studio in Hamburg had training courses for
actors and actresses in fighting for the camera. They didn&#x27;t learn kung
fu as such but how not look ridiculous when imitating it on film. She
was able to wield her pistols, the short staff and a few other weapons
without embarrassing herself during fights.<br /><br />Ali Larter was a different story. Perhaps she was having a bad couple
of weeks, but she always looked out of place during the fights. Her
work with the jointed staff reminded me of a housewife with a
flyswatter. A fight with these two taking on a bunch of bad guys is one
of the dullest I have ever seen.<br /><br />The reunion between the brothers who had been separated for 20 years
was lame--it was as emotional as if one of them was returning from
lunch.<br /><br />Albert Wesker was an almost totally unlikable protagonist. His ambition
was to kill a non zombie official who had killed his father but he came
across as petulant and spoiled. And Boris Kodjoe as Luther was an
extremely bland bad guy. Until the end of the movie he was simply an
ambitious local bureaucrat looking for promotion. In the last reel,
however, he became a kung fu master. He went from a petty timeserver to
a martial arts killer in the blink of an eye. This is a very cheap,
cheap movie. And, as Luke Skywalker says: &#x22;What a piece of junk!&#x22; This
movie is so horrid it&#x27;s funny.<br /><br />ALSO: what made me mad was that during the time they were running away
from the amazon women, they stole the music from Halloween 2! Not
recommended.
