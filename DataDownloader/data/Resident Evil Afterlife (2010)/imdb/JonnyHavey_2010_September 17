Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D Wait For DVD My Critical Perspective: D
Personal Perspective: C- 20/100<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the film series
Resident Evil based on the popular Video Game series with the same
name. Similar to many sequels that have been released recently,
Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson decides to film it in 3D. For
those who have not followed the film series or the video game, the
following is a brief history of Resident Evil. The main character in
the film series is a woman named Alice, played by Milla Jovovich. Alice
used to be a security operative for a corrupt company called the
Umbrella Corporation (a corporation developed both the T Virus and G
Virus and perform various lab experiments) based in Raccoon City.
Basically the company releases a deadly virus (T Virus) that spreads
rapidly around the world and turns infected people into zombies.
Therefore, Alice&#x27;s overall goal is to destroy the Umbrella Corporation
and prevent further infection to the world population. In Resident
Evil: After Life Alice teams up with Claire Redfield (Played by Ali
Larter) who at the end of the third film (Resident Evil Extinction)
Travels to a &#x22;so called&#x22; safe zone known as Arcadia, but has lost her
memory. Together they lead a small group in a quest to discover the
secrets behind Arcadia and continue to hunt the Umbrella Corporation.<br /><br />The Good: First off, the film had the highest grossing opening weekend
box office out of the four films in the series making 27,700,000
dollars. Second, Milla Jovovich is back with her portrayal of Alice and
stays true to her character as she has throughout the series. Alice
along with Claire and their fellow survivors provide the audience with
some very entertaining mindless zombie killing action that has been
seen throughout the series. The best part of the film is the opening
credits. They are able to utilize 3D technology the best in the film
with a sequence where the camera pans around various characters as the
credits are revealed on the screen. This opening scene gives an
overview of the atmosphere of the film without any dialogue and in a
very simple way.<br /><br />The Bad: The time between each action sequence is very boring and lacks
substance, good acting, a thoughtful dialogue and well thought out
plot. The screenplay comes off as being forced together and put
together in a rush. (Example: If the group of survivors needs a swimmer
of course they have a high school swimming all-star.) The story is all
over the place and is very confusing even if this isn&#x27;t the first film
you have seen in the series. Also, besides the 3D in the opening
scene/credits the 3D is unnecessary and does not add to the movie at
all. One example of this is a scene shown in the previews where the
leader of the Umbrella Corporation takes his sunglasses off and throws
them at the audience via 3D for no apparent reason at all<br /><br />Final Thought: The subpar acting of Milla Jovovich along with various
entertaining action sequences does not outweigh the poor scriptwriting,
or the horrible acting of the supporting cast of this film. This film
is just another sequel that was made for the sole reason of making
money and is not worth the 3D ticket prices to see it in the theatres.
Even Resident Evil fans should Wait For DVD to see this film.
