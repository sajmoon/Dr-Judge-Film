If you are a fan of trilogy, you shall not be disappointed. This movie
completely lives up to it&#x27;s expectations. Honestly I don&#x27;t think 3D was
necessary but still it was a great add on. They introduce a new star
cast who were familiar from TV shows etc. and they also did a great
job. Also don&#x27;t storm out of theaters right after the credits, stay for
few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us
with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for
the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn&#x27;t had a major role but
she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies, this one has
more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were
breath-taking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I&#x27;m just not happy
that it wasn&#x27;t long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins
but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next
chapter. And yes believe me there will be a next one! I cannot wait to
own this movie in Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Go watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!
