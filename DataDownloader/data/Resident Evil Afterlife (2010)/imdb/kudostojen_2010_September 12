If you&#x27;re a fan of the first 3 films, this will not be a
disappointment. OK, for me there was one thing that did disappoint me
which happens in the first 20min of the film and slightly changes how i
look at Alice. That&#x27;s my only reason for my 9 rating or i would have
given it a 10. Honestly, i think this is the best one since the first
film. <br /><br />What makes these movies exciting to watch is there are always 2
enemies. One is extremely predictable and easy enough to kill, and the
other...well...they&#x27;re not so easy.<br /><br />From beginning to end we&#x27;re taken on a great ride. The action is
awesome in 3D and well worth seeing in the theatres. There are a lot of
slow motion scenes but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much, i kind of like
them. There was one scene that did remind me of The Matrix with all the
slow motion action but it only lasted a couple of seconds.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not easy now-a-days to satisfy movie goers and have a female
heroine to boot. So many people have tried to make female heroines but
most fail miserably. When i think Milla, i think Resident Evil, just
like Sigourney is to Alien(s).<br /><br />If you&#x27;re new to the franchise i would recommend seeing the first 3
films first. If you don&#x27;t, not a problem, everything is explained so
you&#x27;re caught up.
