I liked previous Resident Evil movies especially the first one. With
great enthusiasm I went to theater, hoping to have a fun Friday night.
But instead of that I ended up here and writing my first review for
this unbelievably bad movie.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn&#x27;t have a bad opening scene, but after
that this movie show everyone how a movie doesn&#x27;t has to be. First this
movie doesn&#x27;t have a prologue nor a conclusion. All fight scenes are
unrealistic, not looks good, and don&#x27;t have spirit. Musics are
terrible, they are all alike and only head bang you and ruin
atmosphere. Acting is bad, really bad, I don&#x27;t want to be so negative
but they don&#x27;t give me anything good to write here, sorry. Sense of
humor can make you vomit. All scary scenes are clich&#xE9; zombie boo
scenes. Almost every visual effect makes you say &#x22;that so much looks
like computer made, this too, this too also,...&#x22;, come on modern games
have better visual effects at these days... and if you look carefully
you can see too many illogical things, but I don&#x27;t want to write here
and give spoilers. I kept directing to last, I can clearly say this,
that was the worst directing I have ever seen in my life, I don&#x27;t know
whether the director did this on purpose or producers forced him but he
ruined movie to take benefits of 3D experience. I think main idea must
be &#x22;lets make a good movie, then lets make it 3D&#x22;, not &#x22;lets make
something in 3D, OK lets make something like movie&#x22;, you understand my
point I think.<br /><br />I&#x27;m really sad and disappointed for this movie, it is even worse than
Alien vs. Predator 2 for me. I&#x27;m sure you can find something better to
spend your money and time. If you are not really obsessed with 3D, I
recommend you to stay away from this movie. (I gave it 2/10, minimum
point is 1 and +1 for 3D.)
