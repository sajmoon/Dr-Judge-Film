The first 3 Resident Evils, to me, were the best movies ever made, and
that&#x27;s why i gave them all 10 out of 10!<br /><br />This one was a disappointment: There&#x27;s TOO much slow motion, it&#x27;s very
short and looks A LOT like the video games (which would be a good
thing, but it looks too much like a video game)! Also, there&#x27;s barely a
story behind the action and the characters are TOO fictional!<br /><br />I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it&#x27;s Resident Evil, and Resident Evil
is epic! If it were any other movie, i would probably give it a 3. <br /><br />Even though i said all of this, i recommend this movie because it&#x27;s
Resident Evil and it&#x27;s still good, but i would try watching it in 3D,
because it looks a lot better (that&#x27;s the one thing good about the
movie, the action parts look AMAZING in 3D).
