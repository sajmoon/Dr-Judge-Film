** out of (****)<br /><br />Are you tired of all the post conversion three dimensional films? How
they are so artificial and rather than being in 3-D, it&#x27;s like 2.5D.
Are you tired of the filmed 3-D movies that sacrifice CGI and high
production values for filmed 3-D? Are you fed up with filmmakers using
cheap 3-D cameras and the product being mediocre? Don&#x27;t you just hate
it when films take themselves too seriously and you just want to sit
back and enjoy a fun popcorn flick? If the answers to all the questions
is a &#x22;no&#x22;, you&#x27;ve come to the right place. Make no mistake, Resident
Evil: Afterlife was filmed in 3-D and is no post conversion money grab.
Moreover, the 3-D cameras that Paul W.S. Anderson used for Afterlife,
were the exact same cameras James Cameron used for his action packed
extravaganza &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. While the 3-D may add a plethora of money to the
budget, is this a cheap film? Fortunately, it is not. The production
values are quite solid and the images on screen look so crystal clear
and the film has such a nice gritty atmosphere. To add to the fun
factor, the third dimensions is highly gimmicky as numerous things come
flying at your face. But the question is, is the film itself
satisfactory or does the 3-D make the film?<br /><br />To answer the thesis statement, it&#x27;s unfortunately a yes. Without the
3-D, it would feel like another paint-by-numbers action flick but
instead is ten times more stylized. Come to think of it, it is a pretty
forgettable and generic outing. Also, the script and characters don&#x27;t
help matters. Albeit, no one can protest about the plot because there
simply was none. Afterlife showcases expositions, 3-D, women with
weaponry, and highly stylized action set pieces. It certainly is no
&#x22;Godfather&#x22; so make sure before going in, you do acknowledge that. Now,
what did I expect while seeing the fourth installment in the highly
iconic franchise? I just expected impressive 3-D, awe-inspiring action
set pieces, and just an overall fun time. Unfortunately, I have to say
that the movie met my expectations because it&#x27;s the truth. The inner,
highly judgmental movie reviewer wanted to loathe this movie to the
deep core and simply view it to add it in my bottom ten of 2010 list,
but, it delivered surprisingly. <br /><br />The 3D: 10/10. Words can&#x27;t describe the epicness of Afterlife&#x27;s third
dimension. The 3D is so fascinating because it actually feels like
you&#x27;re trapped in the movie. I can definitely tell these were the same
3D cameras James Cameron used for &#x22;Avatar&#x22; and that&#x27;s the biggest
complement a 3D movie can have. I&#x27;m a sucker for gimmicky 3-D and it
truly delivered in that aspect. Although, there are some scenes that
use the more subtle technique, but those scenes are probably only
twenty five percent of the movie. Listen to me carefully, only view the
film in 3D! It&#x27;s a huge waste of money not to see it in 3D. Trust me.<br /><br />The Action: 7/10. Had the action been like the first and last ten
minutes for the whole movie, my score would have easily been a &#x22;10&#x22;.
However, most of the action, while still solid, is pretty much generic.
Also, while the occasional moments of fantastic action occurred, they
were blatant rip-offs of The Matrix (the knife throw scene, the glass
shooting scene, the dodging bullets scene, the
&#x22;run-on-the-wall-and-do-a-flip&#x22; sequence, and many more). Still, the
action was good.<br /><br />Cinematography: 10/10. Easily a &#x22;10&#x22;. The movie has a mammoth budget of
sixty billion dollars and it clearly shows. The visuals are so
enriching and have so much depth. This film was shot in several
different locations.<br /><br />Pacing: 7/10. The pacing was pretty good. Some nice breather scenes and
when the action graced the silver screen, the word &#x22;epic&#x22; came to my
mind.<br /><br />Overall, &#x22;Afterlife&#x22; is a fun action extravaganza. The cinematography,
the 3-D, and the action pieces are all worth the price of a matin&#xE9;e.
It&#x27;s just an enjoyable popcorn flick. However, the script and character
development aren&#x27;t anything to write home about, which makes it hard
for this guilty pleasure to warrant a recommendation. Either a matin&#xE9;e
or rental will suffice.
