I&#x27;ve given this 2 out of 10 just for the money they spent on the cars
and guns and look... the film and story sucked, u may say its cuz i
like the original games, i say its just a very bad film with references
from the game. How bad is the story? i mean come on the 1st was
terrible i hoped for better in the 2nd and 3rd and here i am subjecting
my self to the 4th. my gf wanted to watch this just for that Wentworth
Miller guy, what a joke this film was. I guess they spent all the money
on the actors (who where terrible) and special effects because the
Story script and almost everything else sucked. If you have played the
game or enjoy a good story your going to be really disappointed, how
ever if u like a load of nonces guns special effects with bad script
story but pretty looking characters this is it i guess. please tell me
if im wrong but this film was dreadful. how on earth did they get the
money to fund this film~!?
