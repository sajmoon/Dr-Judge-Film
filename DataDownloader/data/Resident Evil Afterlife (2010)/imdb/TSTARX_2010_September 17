2010_September 17 
Of the video games! I played every Resident Evil game, and more than
once. I can honestly say that the reason I score this film so high is
because I saw it in 3D. I was totally blown away by the technological
aspects of this film! But; 3D aside, it was still a large production,
and larger than all three films preceding it.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is one of the best female action hero&#x27;s ever. She is
born for these roles, and also can act! Ali Larter was not as gripping
and emotional in this film, but they still make a good team. I really
think they are friends off=camera.<br /><br />Lets face it, the Resident Evil films were nothing like the video
games. RE2 was probably the closest, because it was more of a horror
film than Sci-fi. The games were like that, closer to horror with a
touch of Sci-fi. Instead, the movies are the opposite, not excluding
this 4th installment. I wonder...what does Resident evil have to do
with the Matrix? or Equilibrium? Nothing if you ask me, but still, a
rather impressive film nonetheless. Afterlife makes the effects in the
Matrix feel like yesteryear. I actually had to take off my 3D glasses
at times! Still, I would trade it all away for the nostalgia of the
games, the Gothic and creepy sets; the Mystery; Umbrealla Corp and
their motives; The scarcity of ammo; the psychological aspects of the
Zombies, reading about what they were going through during
transforming; and finally the soundtrack. I loved the Electronica
soundtrack in this film but would gladly trade it away for the
excellent creepy soundtracks of the video games.<br /><br />Fans of the games won&#x27;t be too disappointed. I was a little, since it
had no plot at all. It was just eye candy to me, but some pretty sweet
candy at that! So if you like roller-coasters, then you will like
Resident Evil : Afterlife.
