at first i want to say that i love Resident Evil that video game and
the first part of the film so i was have Great hope for this part but
when i watch it i Asapetny a big disappointment because there were no
story and There is no new parts of the former and i was felling that Im
watch this movie before &#x3E;&#x3E;&#x3E;&#x3E; i gust enjoyed 3d and the Graphics but the
story i have to say (zero ) &#x3E;another point if you not see the parts of
the movie you will not Understand any thing in this part Because it
depends heavily on the adoption of the preceding sections&#x3E;&#x3E;&#x3E; also the
end it was not so good maybe because i hit the open end but i don&#x27;t
love it . <br /><br />3\10 &#x3E;&#x3E;&#x3E;very disappointment !
