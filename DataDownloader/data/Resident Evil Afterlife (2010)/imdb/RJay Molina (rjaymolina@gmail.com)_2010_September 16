I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because I got exactly what I
wanted out of it: GGG! Short for GIRLS, GUNS, and GORE! If you haven&#x27;t
figured these movies out by now, then you&#x27;re most likely some loyal fan
who expects too much. Yes, I am a fan of the games. But that doesn&#x27;t
mean I want to see an exact replica of the games. There&#x27;s no suspense,
you know who&#x27;s going to live and die. I mean if I wanted an exact
shot-for-shot Resident Evil adaptation, I would play the game! Is this
film dumb? Yes. It&#x27;s a guilty pleasure. And I&#x27;m fine with that. I love
seeing gorgeous women kick ass, I love seeing ridiculous gore, I love
being smart enough to see that this movie is NOT supposed to be
Oscar-worthy. If anything this film was more fun than the previous
installments, there was humor, great action, and hot chicks. Seriously
folks, you should have figured this whole film series out after the
second one. Don&#x27;t come in with high expectations. Go with a group of
friends and have a good time. If there&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s absolutely
incredible, it&#x27;s the 3D. Probably the best since Avatar. Overall
Resident Evil: Afterlife is a bloody good time. Definitely a great way
to end the summer.
