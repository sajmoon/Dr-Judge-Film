Resident Evil: Afterlife was something i looked forward to see because
the previous movies were bad so i decided to give this one a chance, o
boy, was i wrong! this movie does not have any plot it just zombie
killing spree with no story or plot.<br /><br />Acting is just average, nothing special but at least they got the
courtesy to put characters form the video game, but still that won&#x27;t
save this movie it&#x27;s just plot less and doesn&#x27;t have any connection
with the video game franchise(most movies based on a video game are
like this but at least they got a plot to back it up).<br /><br />The CGI was amazing specially the 3D effects if you&#x27;re sitting in the
front row i guarantee you will get blown away, the slow motion might
been overused but hey it&#x27;s Resident Evil for you.<br /><br />Overall just wait till it&#x27;s out on DVD or just rent it, you will waste
your money on this movie.
