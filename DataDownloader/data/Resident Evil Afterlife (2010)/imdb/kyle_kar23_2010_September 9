WOW...where do I begin? I was extremely lucky to attend the premiere of
Resident Evil: Afterlife in Tokyo, Japan, and let me just say, it was
nothing short of amazing. Before the premiere, Avatar (NOT that
Airbender crap)has been my all-time favorite movie. But now that has
changed, mainly for the fact that there is literally NON-STOP ACTION in
Resident Evil: Afterlife. This was the most entertaining movie I&#x27;ve
ever experienced. It grabs onto you and doesn&#x27;t let you go, which is
very rare for movies to do these days. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of any of the
previous Resident Evil installments, but I feel Afterlife is almost
Oscar-worthy simply for the fact that the director knows how to make
great action sequences with fantastic special effects. Not to mention
that the 3D was phenomenal, and really made you feel like you were in
the movie&#x27;s world. I don&#x27;t want to give anything away, but I must warn
that there are some VERY scary,gory, and disturbing scenes in
Afterlife. I can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s only given an R rating. In my
honest opinion, this film is slightly a higher level of maturity than
R. Nevertheless, this is the best movie you&#x27;re going to see in a long,
long time. If you&#x27;re in the mood to get sucked into the most intense
and violent movie yet in cinema to date, Resident Evil: Afterlife is
for you. A flawless 10/10
