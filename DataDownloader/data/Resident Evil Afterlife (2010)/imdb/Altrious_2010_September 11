I am truly not a fan of these movies. I have always loved the Resident
Evil franchise, and that is why I still see these movies. None of that
have been good by movie standards, none of them have been good by
fanboy standards. Resident Evil is one of the only things I have ever
really been a fanboy of. And, of course, fanboys are never pleased.
That&#x27;s just what it is. The games have even been steadily declining.
The movies are just plain awful. I won&#x27;t lie, the first movie wasn&#x27;t
too bad. It was alright because it was general. They made a new story
line and were going with it. Cool. But then, they started to try to
intertwine the game stories and the movie&#x27;s story, and it just makes no
damn sense. There are two kinds of people who like the RE franchise.
Those who like the games and movies because it&#x27;s about zombies, and
that&#x27;s enough for you. Cool, it&#x27;s general, there&#x27;s zombies, and there&#x27;s
blood. Awesome. But, I am a fan of the franchise because of it&#x27;s
in-depth storyline, and its character development. And the movies have
none of that. And, putting aside the fact that this is a remake of a
video game, it was just a bad movie in general. It was short, I
couldn&#x27;t find a real storyline, and there was way to much slow motion.
And hell, the antagonist was in only two scenes of the movie. That&#x27;s
just unacceptable.
