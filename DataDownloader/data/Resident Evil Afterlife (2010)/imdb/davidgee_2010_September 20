This is a big improvement on my last two horror nights at the
multiplex: PIRANHA and THE LAST EXORCISM. That said, it&#x27;s pretty
formulaic. A handful of survivors of the killer virus are holed up in a
Los Angeles fortress prison surrounded by thousands of hungry zombies.<br /><br />Zombies are getting savvier with each successive movie appearance. They
manage to tunnel and smash their way in - predictably. Also fairly
predictable is who&#x27;s going to make it to the final reel and who&#x27;s
destined to be zombie snacks. The plot leapfrogs from scene to scene
with huge how-did-they-get-here gaps, but series super-heroine Milla
Jovovich is in great shape and there&#x27;s a splendidly hiss-able
uber-baddie head of the Umbrella Corp. The 3-D is good and not too
&#x27;intrusive&#x27;. The zombie attacks are visceral without being too gross.
There are some great sets and eye-boggling stunts.<br /><br />As video-game adaptations go, this pushes all the right buttons.
