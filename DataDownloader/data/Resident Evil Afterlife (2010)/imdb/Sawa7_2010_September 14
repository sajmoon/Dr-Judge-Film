i just got back from the cinema after this badly directed, written
movie, what where they thinking when they done this, the movie is bad,
i like the first 3 but this one is bad, i read couple of reviews before
i went hoping that the bad ones are untrue, but i was wrong, i totally
agree with all the bad reviews, the acting is weak, no point of the
movie what so ever, continuing the story, but killing it as well, i
hope people read the bad reviews and believe them, if u liked the 3
first movies, then stay away from this one, because you will be
disappointed, this is my second review here on IMDb, and i had to get
this out from my system before someone else makes the mistake of
watching this
