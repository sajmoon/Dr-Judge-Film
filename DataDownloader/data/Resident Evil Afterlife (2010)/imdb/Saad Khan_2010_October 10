RESIDENT EVIL:AFTER LIFE &#x96; CATCH IT ( B+ ) I love Resident
Evil:AFTERLIFE, I was on edge of my seat the whole time and watching
Milla Jovovich as Alice reminds me off how much we love her. I still
remember the Red Hot costume of hers in Resident Evil 1 and after that
it&#x27;s a history especially with this one, which has become the highest
grossing movie among all the Resident Evil movies. So I thing the whole
Gang will be coming back . Yahhhh . Mila Jovovich is the best female
Action actress after Angelina Jolie though Angie has proved her Action
Heroin Status in different Action movies where as Milla is stuck to
Resident Evil franchise only, but that&#x27;s okay we still love her. Ali
Larter is the second most important essence to the Resident Evil
franchise and I loved her in T.V show Heroes though I still think her
role was never shaped up the way it should have. (who cares now as the
show is canceled). Bravo for bringing WentWorth Miller, everyone love
him and thanks God he is the part of the this franchise. Boris Kodjoe
and Spencer Locke seems like permanent part of the franchise too, not
bad at all. Shawn Roberts is really cool villein and I think he will be
returning too next time, which is Awesome! Overall it was a great fun
to watch them fight zombies and evils yet again, can&#x27;t wait for them to
fight again.
