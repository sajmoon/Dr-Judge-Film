For me personally this movie was a major disappointment. I consider
myself a fan of all things Zombie. Being such I believe Zombie movies
should include &#x22;Zombies&#x22; as a main part of the film. Unfortunately in
this movie the Zombies were used basically as a morbid backdrop at
best.<br /><br />Resident Evil Afterlife was more about Annie&#x27;s ongoing battle with the
Umbrella Corporation and its waves and waves of armed guards. It began
looking like a cheap rip-off of the Matrix trilogy from years gone by.
Even their new Umbrella Corp. &#x22;bad guy&#x22; seems to be invincible like the
Agents in the Matrix.<br /><br />The Zombies themselves (although true to the game) have taken on a new
squid faced appearance turning their looks into something more like a
bastard child of Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) apposed to a
traditional Zombie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a true representation of the video game you&#x27;ll
probably be pleased with this movie, but if you are looking for a great
Zombie flick you just might end up being as disappointed as I was.<br /><br />I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait for World War Z for my next Zombie fix... I
just hope it turns out better than Afterlife did.
