Just wanna say do not waste time and money for this piece of crap! Few
day ago I rented all 4 parts because my friend told me that I made
mistake and didn&#x27;t watch them. So I bought popcorn, 4L juice and free
day just to see them. And then realized I didn&#x27;t mistake. Acting is
going from bad to worst, scripting is so shallow that even 2 years old
child can&#x27;t be foxed. Camera is focused almost always on their faces
and background is very blur. It&#x27;s hell bad movie so just be human to
yourself and don&#x27;t watch it. If you even want to watch be aware that is
completely waste of time, money and life. And if you wish to go in
theater... well use very, very, very big of alcohol because you&#x27;ll
regret.
