First thing first I&#x27;m a huge fan of the first movie Resident Evil; I
like the style and everything. Sadly for me that change over the course
of the follow-up which they decide to make it less suspense and more of
the action base. Which make me happy to know that Paul W.S. Anderson
came back in the director chair to make this movie &#x96; unfortunately for
me that don&#x27;t really help, I felt as if I was watching Dawn of the Dead
with guns (though After Life is a Whole lot better than the 2nd and
3rd) .<br /><br />Synopsis: Alice along with the few survivors trap themselves in an
abandon High State Prison surrounded zillion zombies as they seek the
way out to what they believe to be the last safe place known as
Arcadia.<br /><br />The story felt like a comic now that there are already four parts into
it as we slowly follow each journey of Alice and it very much felt
episodic, luckily we finally get the chance to see the guy behind
Umbrella Corp. There isn&#x27;t much to say about the story really but
bewared don&#x27;t get too much hope on it; just watch it for action
sequences.<br /><br />As for the casting, I thought it was so-so, with Milla look a hell lot
better than in Extinction, lol. The castings of Welworth (Prison Break)
do add a little status to this movie, though I hardly see his present
really help this movie much. Shawn as Wesker has a lot of resemblance
to the original but the bad part was doesn&#x27;t really work out that great
when in the movie Overall I don&#x27;t really have nothing much to say about
this movie, but I do enjoy it a whole lot better than Apocalypse and
Extinction. The action part is pretty awesome especially the fight
sequences between Axe Man (aka Executioner) though very very short. The
heavy metal music work well in some parts. (Since I didn&#x27;t watch it in
3D I can&#x27;t say it has awesome effect). I say, hell just go and watch it
when there is nothing on TV, you might enjoy it if you doesn&#x27;t go too
much on pin point the flaw ad loophole in the story.<br /><br />Recommendation: Worth A Rental from your local DVD store.<br /><br />Reason to Watch: You have been watching it the past three movies, just
cont. watching it.<br /><br />Reason not to: It never seems to end, is it? <br /><br />Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)
