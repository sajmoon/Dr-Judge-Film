man what a drag this movie was.i was bored out out of my skull for most
of the running time.this is easily the worst of the Resident Evil
franchise so far,in my opinion.parts of it reminded me of
Ultraviolet,which i hated.it also reminded me of Aeon Flux,which i also
didn&#x27;t like very much.this movie is not that bad,but it isn&#x27;t very
good.there were a couple good things about it.the undead had something
that made them a bit more deadly this time around,and there was a
really neat undead character introduced.other than that though,i found
it slow and boring in general,and compared to the other films in the
franchise.for me,Resident Evil: Afterlife is a 4/10
