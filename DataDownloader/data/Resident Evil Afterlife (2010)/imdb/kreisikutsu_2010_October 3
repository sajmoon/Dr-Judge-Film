First off, to those who claim 3D was blurry or whatnot: Choose a good
theater and have your glasses replaced as soon as you see that
something is off, because I watched it on digital screen and the 3D was
absolutely perfect and really crisp in our theater, I could make out
tiniest details in every scene, so I really do not understand those
complaints (maybe it&#x27;s from cast of a rivaling 3D movie or something?
:D).<br /><br />And now, to the point:<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot more than RE2 and even RE3 in some ways.<br /><br />I had to forgive it a few cheesy moments (bullets flying slower than
they should in few scenes) and some a bit over-emotional acting on
Jovovich part (especially the cam bits). That said, I am yet to see an
actor make a good &#x22;Imma gonna record myself on the cam now and be all
emotional about my long lost friends and stuff&#x22; footage. Any cam
recording in any movie just seems unrealistic to me.<br /><br />Great over-all atmosphere, a few nice jump-scares, nice 3D and action
(maybe a bit clich&#xE9;d sometimes, but I personally had never seen those
scenes in 3D, and it was fun to see the dust flying off the walls and
empty shells and rubble fly towards you etc.) Sometimes it reminded me
of the first movie. They even used a song from the second, which made
me feel a bit nostalgic, since I really like the RE2 soundtrack (not
the movie itself as much). Part 3 was just too &#x22;wastelandy&#x22; to me and
it was good to see RE in it&#x27;s natural habitat once again: a big city,
lot&#x27;s of zombies. Plus &#x22;the stuff&#x22;: mutants, dogs, and a nice surprise
(I cannot recall if it was shown in the trailers so I won&#x27;t spoil him,
but very nice fight scene).<br /><br />Tl,dr: 3D was &#x22;Let me pull that knife out of my forehead and wipe that
blood off my glasses... wow, look at those raindrops fall on her feet!&#x22;
perfect. Acting and story could be better, but I liked it in many ways
more than parts 2 and even 3.<br /><br />Conclusion: For a RE fan - must see, especially if you liked the first
one and did not like where parts 2 and 3 were going.
