This was a great Resident Evil movie the only thing that stopped it
from getting 10 out of 10, is that like with all 3D movies the director
feels the need to stick things in your face so you get the 3D feel.
That gets old really fast especially if you have seen other 3D movies.<br /><br />If you see the movie in 2D its going to look stupid. When this movie
makes it to DVD and BluRay it needs to be released in 3D or again it
will look stupid with all the stuff being put in your face. In 3D it
looks nice if its not over done but in 2D the film will look stupid and
pointless. I have seen Friday the 13th part 3 in 3D when it came out
and I have it on DVD in 2D and having pitchforks and stuff thrust at
you 2D makes you laugh. <br /><br />If the producers and so on read this please do your self a favor and
put it out only in 3D.<br /><br />The vision of this movie will be lost in anything else and just look
stupid. I own all of the Resident Evil movies on both DVD and Bluray,
and will end up getting this one too but only if its in 3D.<br /><br />I still think that Milla needs to come here and date me but thats a
different story lol.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie its not the best one but with all the other junk out
there this is by far the best one, and it needs to be watched in 3D. Oh
and Milla call me some time lol.
