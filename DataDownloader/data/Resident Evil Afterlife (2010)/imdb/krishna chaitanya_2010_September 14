The movie was quite awesome... And especially when comes to the action
sequences, everyone jaw dropping... aside from the action sequences,
Milla performance is a benefit to the movie.... She was already a good
actor and it was proved in &#x22;the Fourth kind&#x22;... And Milla grabbed
everyone&#x27;s attention with her mesmerizing action... Background score is
one of the advantage for this movie..... And the background score was
electrifying.... Though the climax disappointed me with an abrupt end
but the rest of the movie is very fine...I expected there might be a
long climax between villain and Milla, but i say the climax is an
excellent work by the director... Those who are the Action lovers
should definitely watch this movie.... It&#x27;s fantastic...
