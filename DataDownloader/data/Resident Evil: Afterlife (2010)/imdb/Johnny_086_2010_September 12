I&#x27;ve seen all Resident Evil movies but not because I&#x27;m a RE fan, it&#x27;s
more because I&#x27;m a Milla Jovovich fan. I loved the previous ones
especially the first one but I think this one is the greatest and show
us what is coming next is going to be awesome. Milla is again Alice and
she&#x27;s the best of this film, I fall in love with bad-ass girls and
she&#x27;s the perfect one. The second thing great about this film is the
great and awesome action sequences in 3D which is, in my opinion,
better than Avatar and any other 3D movie. It&#x27;s true that the movie
doesn&#x27;t have the greatest plot but it&#x27;s quite good for what the movie
is. Maybe some people will not like the many slow-motion action scenes
&#x22;Matrix-Style&#x22;, but it shows you the beauty of the 3D can do in a great
action movie. <br /><br />8/10 = The best from the saga, and wait for the next one, I&#x27;m sure it
will be even better than this one!
