Before I watched this part of the Resident Evil installment, I had
lowered my expectation to the point of expecting my eyeballs to endure
~90 minutes of violence, lack of story and graphical, visceral combat.
Like the other flicks in the genre, basically.<br /><br />The story itself is weak at best. Continuing from the previous movie,
she finds herself following a transmission from the self proclaimed
haven Arcadia and looking for survivors in LA, where she meets the rest
of the film&#x27;s cannon fodder surrounded by a rather large group of
hungry looking people with a bad skin complexion.<br /><br />Now I enjoyed many zombie, splatter, lack-of-story films over the last
years. Shawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Hobo With a Shotgun, blah
blah... Loads. And I was expecting something similar, in all my
naivety. From the start of the movie, all the way towards the start of
the credits, it felt like I had watched every scene in the movie in
other movies. At the beginning I just disregarded them, but as the
first 20 minutes came to a close, I realized that it really was a bad
ripoff of many well-know action movies. Scenes literally copied from
the Matrix trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, The Island... the list is
terribly long and wrong.<br /><br />Overall the movie is unsatisfying. The story is weak, the ending
annoying, the character development is so bad that it just makes all of
them unpleasant and you nearly shout &#x22;YES!&#x22; each time someone is turned
to food. The flow of the movie is action packed and predictable, giving
the weak story another punch in the groin and like going in
thrill-rides in an amusement park, if you keep doing the same kind, you
end up not enjoying them anymore. That&#x27;s how this movie made me feel in
the end.
