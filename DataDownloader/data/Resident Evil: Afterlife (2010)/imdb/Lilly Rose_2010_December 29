After watching some tragic sequel movies over the past years, this was
one movie that I really liked. The movie isn&#x27;t great, It starts of slow
and ends slow. Nothing special happens but It&#x27;s worth watching it. As a
fan, I&#x27;ve watched all four of the movies and liked them. Maybe because
I didn&#x27;t allow myself to dislike it, but it&#x27;s far better then some lame
movies like Twilight receiving such high praise and achieving more
money then a worth while movie like this. The action scenes aren&#x27;t that
bad either. The fight scenes start with a bang and ends with another
bang. Milla&#x27;s facial expression and her tone is the same through out
the movies, she acts like a dead soul, but in the place she lives, I
think that&#x27;s just about right. I liked the movie, It was not bad at
all. Thumb ups from me. Will hope for yet another sequel..
