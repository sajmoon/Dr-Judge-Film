Fourth spectacular , action-packed and stirring installment of the
&#xA8;Resident Evil series&#xA8; , adapted from the video games characters
produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a
video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should .
Umbrella Corp (The Hive) is the front for some genetics operations and
a secret military tech . The deadly virus has decimated the world,
exception a little zone in Alaska where live people no-infected . Years
later , one time Racoon was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by
ambitious Dr. Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) continues his weird
experiments with the deadly T-virus . The deadly virus has been
released and reanimated the dead , the Zombies spread the epidemic and
those exposed to cruel bite suffer a complete transformation turning
into meat-eating sickos . Alice (Milla Jovovich) is attempting to
survive , and goes to Alaska , traveling throughout ice desert . While
still out to destroy the evil Umbrella Corporation , Alice flies with
Claire (Ali Larter) to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors
on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead .
Alice finds new mysterious survivors (Kim Coates , Sergio Peris
Mencheta , Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller) at a building in L.A .
Alice joins a group of survivors and they must confront carnivorous
hordes of zombies starving of human flesh and an evil corporation chief
who creates the most horrifying creatures ever made . The survivor
group is surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic .
The misfit bunch wants to relocate to the suspicious but supposedly
unharmed safe haven known only as Arcadia.<br /><br />Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist
amusement with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This
exciting picture contains thrills, chills , action-filled with fierce
combats and lots of gore and guts. The horror and action moments are
fast moving and compactly realized. This sequel takes more , more
approach , more fights , more blood and gore . The film turns out to be
a crossover between &#x27;the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2&#x27;, the &#x27;George
A Romero&#x27;s Zombies&#x27;, &#x27;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Dawn of the dead&#x27; and genetic
experiments from &#x27;Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga&#x27; and the
monsters from &#xA8;Blade&#xA8; and &#xA8;Lord of Rings&#xA8;. Of course, the film takes
ideas from former parts as &#x27;Resident evil&#x27;(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here
also producer , director and screenwriter) and &#x27;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&#x27; (2004,Alexander Witt) . The creepy images of wide range
from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and
amazing frames. It&#x27;s predictable but we have seen the previous chapters
but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic
acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The
flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams,
shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible
zombie cannibals . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic
events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the fantastic
scenarios in Los Angeles totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures
. Cool,luminous cinematography using Steadicam by Glen MacPherson and
haunting,pulsing Techno-musical score by Tomandandy .The motion picture
is regularly directed but with startling visual style by Paul W
Anderson.<br /><br />The complete saga is formed by the following films : &#xA8;Resident evil&#xA8; by
Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James
Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of
containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who
have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of
defensive measures to contain the virus . It&#x27;s followed by &#xA8;Resident
evil II : Apocalypse&#xA8; by Alexander Witt with Jared Harris , Iain Glen ,
Oded Fehr , Sienna Guillory . And &#xA8;Resident evil III&#xA8; by Russell
Mulcahy with Ali Larter, Ashanti , Mike Epps , Oded Fehr and of course
Milla Jovovich.
