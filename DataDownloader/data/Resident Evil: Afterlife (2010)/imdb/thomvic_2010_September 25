OK I didn&#x27;t see this in 3D so maybe seeing it in 3D would have given
the film a bit of an edge. But I judge films based on their plot and
entertainment and I can enjoy a film even if it isn&#x27;t in 3D - I think
that it is mainly just an incentive for you to like it even more. In my
opinion, if a movie is horrible and its in 3D - it is simply that. A
movie that is bad and in 3D.<br /><br />Now afterlife isn&#x27;t a horrible movie. I enjoyed the first three, in
particular the third, which I think the is the best of the three.
Afterlife is simply more the same excuse to have big special effects
and continue a plot that simply seems will never end with Umbrella
continuing on forever in the next &#x27;afterlife&#x27;.<br /><br />The monsters in this movie were good, but I think the zombies don&#x27;t
really play much of a part in the horror and are simply there just to
add to the atmosphere. Also, I felt that near the end, it borrows too
much from the Matrix and is really nothing original.<br /><br />I was also expecting more from the characters who appeared in the third
film and they really aren&#x27;t given much to do. Milla Jovovich is fine in
her role but she simply is given the same mission over and over in all
the films - save people and get them to safety. Honestly, how many
times do you have to see this done in each Resident Evil movie? I&#x27;m not
saying this isn&#x27;t entertaining nor is it visually nice, but I think if
they keep doing this over and over, it&#x27;s gonna wear thin pretty soon.
I&#x27;d wait for the DVD.
