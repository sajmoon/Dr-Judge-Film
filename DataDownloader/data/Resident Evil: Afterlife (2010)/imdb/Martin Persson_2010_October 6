2010_October 6 
With a good concept, decent actors and a strong budget, I had expected
more. The action is great, even if the slow-mo is a bit excessive at
times. The problem is what happens between the action, or rather, the
lack of anything happening between the action.<br /><br />This movie is just a series of action cutscenes edited together into
some sort of a movie, but there is no storytelling going on at all. It
feels like the director couldn&#x27;t be bothered doing anything but the
action scenes. There is nothing smart, no suspense and no thrill. Just
action that looks like its copied straight from &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, but
without the finesse, and that leaves you feeling indifferent and
unimpressed.<br /><br />This movie suffers from the usual sequel virus, symptoms are less
smarts, less story, less atmosphere and more CGI to compensate. It&#x27;s
unnecessary, lazy and insulting to the fans that the Resident Evil
Franchise does not try to keep a higher level of quality, especially
when they have the actors and the money to do something really good.<br /><br />Final verdict is that the movie is &#x22;ok&#x22; for a Resident Evil fan, but
even for a fan this is pushing the lower quality limit. Personally I
hope they get another director for the next movie, like Christopher
Nolan or Ridley Scott, imagine that.
