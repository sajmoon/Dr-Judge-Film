I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil films,and when I saw this movie I
thought the CGI was awesome the lines were pretty good, they could have
been better and the action was very very good. The only thing that was
bad was the story, which in my opinion there wasn&#x27;t much of a story.
Sure you finally see Wesker, Chris, and find out Arcadia is fake, but
thats the only big things you find out about. So I really think Paul
Anderson, in all that time that he spent playing the games should have
pulled a little more aspects from RE 5 and Code Veronica, because those
were supposable the two games that he used to get inspiration from. And
that is why I give it a 7\10
