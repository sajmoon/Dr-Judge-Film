After 4 years of the so called evil corporation &#x22;Umbrella&#x22;, we still
haven&#x27;t gotten tired of this particular franchise. As entertaining as
it may seems, we might be getting a little tired of Mila Jovovich being
undefeatable (even though she doesn&#x27;t have any powers in this film) by
the undead zombies. The plot is simple and straight forward. Alice
(Jovovich) continues her journey on trying to destroy the whole
Umbrella Corporation. Joining her this time is Ali Larter (Heroes),
Wentworth Miller (Prison Break), and Boris Kodjoe (Undercovers). Not
that this cast is any better than its previous instalment. Though it
may be in 3D, but few scenes actually worked in 3D. Paul W.S.
Anderson&#x27;s (directed the first Resident Evil) directing is as bad as it
can be. The camera angles weren&#x27;t right and he just doesn&#x27;t know what
to do with the material on his hands. Resident Evil: Afterlife may
serve as a treat for fans, but critics find this bad for your teeth.
