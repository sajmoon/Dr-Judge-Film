Good for the Friday night, a lot of time and effort went into this as
you will be able to see from the very 1st scene.<br /><br />Pros: The usual amazing metal techno soundtrack, kick ass moves, no
long boring scenes which take forever.<br /><br />Cons: Seemed to end abruptly when it seemed it should have had an extra
20 mins, slow motion scenes seem to appear too frequently and somehow
spoil certain fight scenes.<br /><br />All in all, definitely go to see it if you are a fan of the series. If
you have not seen previous instalments, it may be a little confusing,
but will still enjoy it as the start explains the story very shortly.
