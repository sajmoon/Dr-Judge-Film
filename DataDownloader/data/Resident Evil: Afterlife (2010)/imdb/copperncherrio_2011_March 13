I must be honest that this is my first Resident Evil movie and I am not
big into Zombies (except in Shaun of the Dead and Zombie Land) where
Zombies are actually funny and not scary. I hate things that just pops
up and scares people.<br /><br />So since I&#x27;m not big into the genre, I can&#x27;t say that I really liked
the movie. They did have some interesting filming angles, as well as
great effect, however, the plot sucked. But I realized that is not the
purpose of the Resident Evil franchise. So I do understand.<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t see where this series is going, but I understand its
appeal.<br /><br />I do however love Mia. She is one hot lady.
