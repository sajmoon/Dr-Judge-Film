I was lucky I was invited to the premiere in 3D and boy I loved it!!
The whole movie is full of very fast action sequences which are largely
enhanced by the 3D feature. In terms of the storyline, it keeps moving
further away from the video game series but that is not a problem, both
are similar stories and many people are fans of both the films and the
video-games. Mila J. rocks as Alice (as usual ;) and the other
characters are awesome (specially Ali Larter as Claire and the guy from
Prison Break as Chris). There are way more zombies but less
zombie-action but that doesn&#x27;t mean the survivors weren&#x27;t busy...<br /><br />Wesker looks and acts a lot like his video game self, so that is a plus
for the gamers who go see it. Now, here is the important bit of this
review: If you haven&#x27;t seen the other three films, do yourself a favor
and watch&#x27;em before watching this one; otherwise you&#x27;ll be lost from
the first action sequence up to half the movie at least... And be
polite and read the credits. You&#x27;ll be rewarded!!
