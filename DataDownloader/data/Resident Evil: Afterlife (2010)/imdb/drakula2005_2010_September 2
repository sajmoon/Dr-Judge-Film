2010_September 2 
I saw Resident Evil when it got out back in 2002, and was impressed by
the tension and action and, by Milla Jovovich, of course.Although
flawed, the second installment of the franchise found more room to
expand to than i could&#x27;ve ever imagined.And though it was logical, the
third one provided the goods as well with more action and a bigger
picture, as well.<br /><br />Now, visiting a pre-screening of &#x22;a movie&#x22;, everything would&#x27;ve been
perfect, if the movie was one of Zack Snyder&#x27;s upcoming efforts, or
Milla/Anderson&#x27;s new Resident Evil.And boy, was i happy to know it was
one of my most anticipated movies this year.<br /><br />Now, Alice is back, once again.I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, because
the series were strong and solid so far, but it isn&#x27;t easy to keep up
the good pace.So, at first, i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be easy to
match the prequels, especially the scale of the last installment.<br /><br />But then, the news about the 3D came around, and followed by the fusion
system technology announcement, the infamous Cameron creation, that
will be used almost ruthlessly often in the future, it was all clear.I
saw it getting better and better, the development of the movie was
incredible lately and, though the trailer wasn&#x27;t saying much, i was
kind of hoping to cover the best parts, and i luckily hoped right and
this was the best part-i wasn&#x27;t expecting even half of the action and
battle sequences i saw.<br /><br />And i must say, that the cast is the best, that could&#x27;ve been
assembled.Ali Larter is great, she&#x27;s grown so much to the series, that
fits her perfectly well.Wenthwort Miller is cool, a little bit
Scofield-like, but that&#x27;s normal.After all, he was great as a con.The
only thing i missed was Oded Fehr, who has portrayed a very likable and
convincing character in the 2-nd and 3-rd installments.<br /><br />And, surprisingly, the script had more incommon with the videogames
than the prequels had.I mean, that&#x27;s a fresh take, and the 3D makes it
better.This is probably the best 3D since How to Train Your Dragon was
around, and as a horror/action movie-the best of it&#x27;s kind.Just to
compare, the technology was way better than the 3D, used in the last
&#x22;Destination&#x22; installment and, as well, better then &#x22;Valentine&#x27;s Day&#x22;
remake.And those movies made a lot of profits at the Box Office.<br /><br />And to add something up-i red a review, claiming that the movie is a
&#x22;Matrix&#x22; rip-off.So my advice is this-don&#x27;t listen to those
claims-first of all, there were some stunts, looking very similar to a
couple, featured in &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, but the script led very logically to
them, and this isn&#x27;t a trademark for &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;.People dodging
bullets or walking on walls-wow i&#x27;ve seen this somewhere else-oh yes,
in, at least 2 or 3 movies.Second of all, those scenes are very sane
and surely not even looking close to those, in the Wachovski movie,
instead being shot in an entirely different style.It&#x27;s like claiming
that a car, plane or train explosion is a trademark for some movie.And
those people should admit, that The Matrix is also copying a couple of
movies.And those movies are Alex Proyas&#x27;s &#x22;Dark City&#x22; and Germany&#x27;s
&#x22;Welt am Draht&#x22;.So don&#x27;t give the audience false infos.<br /><br />Another interesting thing was the way Anderson shot the movie-in
entirely different style from the previous ones.This new moves are
definitely a change in direction for Anderson as a director, a fresh
and surely an epic one.<br /><br />So expect &#x22;Afterlife&#x22; to surpass the domestic achievements of its
predecessors, because, aside from the fusion tech and the hype
surrounding it&#x27;s release, the movie has something the above-mentioned
movies don&#x27;t-a convincing lead.Because Milla Jovovich sets the mark for
lead female characters in all movies to come, and she&#x27;s
fantastic-Alice&#x27;s return and the role that fits Milla Jovovich the
most.<br /><br />Fantastic movie for fans, a real peak in it&#x27;s genre.<br /><br />And one of the best movies of its kind this year.<br /><br />My rate:A deserved 10/10 for Milla &#x26; co.
