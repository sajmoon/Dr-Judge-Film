I never expected this movie to be AWESOME. I love the games, like the
movies and it is fun to see some things from the games being played out
such as characters along with the monsters etc, BUT this movie was the
worst of the 4. I feel like this series keeps going and doesn&#x27;t get any
better. There are constant gaps in the plot, random people come into
play and we never know why and other people are just gone and again we
don&#x27;t know why. I love the idea of these movies and I know they will
never be great, they remain simply a bored-need-something-to-watch type
of series for me. I give this one a 3 star rating simply because of
what they are. I guess if you don&#x27;t go in expecting much then they are
likable but if you go in and watch them expecting some A+++ movie etc.,
you will HATE them. There&#x27;s plenty of action which I guess is good but
it doesn&#x27;t make the movie any better, not enough zombies, b-level
acting and for me, not many likable characters, I feel like everyone is
so cold. I don&#x27;t want to hate these movies but every time another one
comes out I feel my heat sink a little more.
