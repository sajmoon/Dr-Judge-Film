&#x22;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x22; is the only film which has 3D version worth
to be experienced since 2009&#x27;s &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. After &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, the other 3D
films didn&#x27;t have satisfying 3D effects on them such as &#x22;Clash of the
Titans&#x22; and &#x22;The Last Airbender&#x22;. The 3D effects were just not visible
at all like it&#x27;s the same as 2D only with higher price. The animated
films however did have better 3D effects but were still average. But,
&#x22;Afterlife&#x22; is different and the 3D is really real. I have to tell you,
&#x22;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x22; has to be experienced in 3D.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t expect award-winning acting performances and a great storyline.
Just expect some fighting actions with great 3D effects. If you set
your expectations in an average level, you&#x27;ll be surprised, but don&#x27;t
put expectations too high like what you&#x27;ll put for &#x22;Inception&#x22; or
something. If it hadn&#x27;t been released in 3D, I wouldn&#x27;t be bothering to
watch it so 3D is the main reason why I went to see this movie.<br /><br />The story is very simple for this movie. It&#x27;s just Alice trying to find
uninfected humans who have survived in the whole world. So, the story
is just plain. Nothing to be proud of.<br /><br />So, if the story sucked, why did it receive a score of 7 stars?<br /><br />The 3D rocked. Bullets shot really went out of the screen and made the
movie looked spectacular. With many action scenes, the movie becomes
enjoyable and truly, a memorable 3D film. I know the previous films
were awful but this one is just damn great. Just cool.<br /><br />Tips if you want to enjoy this film: 1. Don&#x27;t think about the story,
the script or the acting. 2. Don&#x27;t take your 3D glasses off. 3.
Experience the Action Scenes in Amazing 3D!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor in watching the first real 3D experience in
theaters since &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. Even though it looks horrible, trust me, it&#x27;s
not as bad as it looks. 7 stars for the combination of breathtaking
action scenes and great 3D effects. Just follow the 3 simple tips above
and you&#x27;ll have a fun time watching this.
