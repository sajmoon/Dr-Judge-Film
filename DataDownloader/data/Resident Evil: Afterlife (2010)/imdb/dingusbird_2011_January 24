attention. leave your brain at home. it will not be needed to watch
this movie. and WARNING if you attempt to bring it don&#x27;t expect to
leave the theatre feeling fulfilled<br /><br />It bothers me that guns can fire endlessly. that is until the
characters decide its time for a slow motion shot then they discard it
and grab another from ?somewhere?<br /><br />It bothers me that alice supposely can fly from alaska to LA on one
tank of fuel. Seriously whats with that? This movie has no plot and it
would have been much more entertaining to fill in the gap here. If you
use your brain you might have been able to surmise that she would have
needed to land to refuel... landing at various airports trying to find
fuel whilst defending from the undead would have been a more well
thought out and entertaining plot IMO<br /><br />It bothers me that the Hollywood appear to burn straight for 4 years.
what is it made of? If it has enough energy to burn for 4 years
straight then why aren&#x27;t we running our cars on burning of Hollywood
signs. this completely annoys me ... OH LETS HAVE A KEWL SCENE WHERE
SHE FLIES BY THE Hollywood SIGN AND ITS LIKE ITS BURNING AND ITS LIKE A
REMINDER OR SOMETHING OF PAST SOCIETY AND HOW LIKE ITS LIKE OVER CAUSE
LIKE THE UNDEAD ARE HERE ! nevermind that after 4 years most if not ALL
of the fires would be out of fuel.<br /><br />and most of all it bothers me that I watched an ~80 minute movie and I
feel like absolutely nothing interesting happened. There isn&#x27;t really a
plot. the main character goes from one place to another. does one
thing. then shoots a bunch and its over. It was the same with the movie
before this resident evil extinction. who agrees with me that both
these 80 minute movies could&#x27;ve been combined into one regular length
movie? Go watch quantum of solice or inception and you will feel like
you&#x27;ve been around the globe twice and enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />well at least there is one fun thing to do while watching this movie.
try and count the bullets before the characters reload. <br /><br />PS Paul in the next movie can you just cast KACEY BARNFIELD as the only
character. don&#x27;t worry about the plot or dialog just have her on screen
the entire time. god is she gorgeous
