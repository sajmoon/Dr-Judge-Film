I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because it was everything I
expected it to be. It was nothing but action, suspense, and guns. I
went to the movie theatre expecting a sequel of a motif that&#x27;s beaten
over and over again; zombies and guns. Though, Iwas surprised that the
movie had played a little different from all of the other RE&#x27;s. In this
film, the main antagonist, Wesker, was confronted a lot. In fact, he
was killed about 3 times in the movie. The only part of the film I
didn&#x27;t agree with was how he got away each time. He would somehow get
in a big helicopter and fly off. It was kind of depressing , seeing as
how the director couldn&#x27;t think of a more creative way for him to
escape. In the Resident Evil games, Wesker is portrayed as an extremely
cunning individual and can often get out of trouble while still making
it suspenseful or interesting. Often, the story would kind of lose its
place at times. Scenes would jump from one another and you wouldn&#x27;t
understand what&#x27;s going on. The movie didn&#x27;t explain itself that well,
but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a sequel, they expect you to know where they&#x27;re
coming from. Its obvious that the same people who create the game and
those who make the movie are two totally different people. As for the
special effects, there is a completely different story. The parts of
the film that were shot in slow-mo were amazing. They timed it
perfectly too. Usually, when things were getting blown up, the slow- mo
aspect would jump in, making everything vivid and suspenseful. I think
the important thing that the movie enforced was that there was going to
be another sequel. Everything was pretty much left in question. No
books were closed and that&#x27;s what I expected. This film was not
intended for an Emmy but more to provide us with some traditional RE
action and suspense. One other aspect of the movie that I liked were
the small clips that were put in from the video game. For those who
play RE, they helped clarify or relate to what we understand and tied
the plot a little tighter. Again, the reason I gave this film a 10/10
was because it was everything I expected. I wasn&#x27;t surprised at all
with the ending, but, like I said before, that&#x27;s what I wanted in this
particular movie. After all, it was created after a game that&#x27;s been
out for quite a while now.
