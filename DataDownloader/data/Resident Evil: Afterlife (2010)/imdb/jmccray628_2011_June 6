Here are other questions:<br /><br />1. Where did Alice get the fuel for hot pink airplane? 2. How did Alice
charge her camcorder? 3. When did zombies start running and swimming?
4. Who was the villain wearing the shades? 5. Where did the monster
with the big ax come from? 6. Why mention two characters are brother
and sister and then give us no plot?<br /><br />This was a horrible movie without a plot. I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t pay for it
but I had to post because it does an injustice to the video game
series.<br /><br />i watched this film in horror. It appeared to be just thrown together
to make money. i hope the next one stay true to the games because this
one is horrible.
