Resident Evil Afterlife manages the rare feat of seamlessly tying
together a wide breath of movie styles; the zombie horror genre mixed
with the monster movie genre to the slickness of the Matrix style
environments and shootouts all encased in a disaster movie shell and
characters. And, it&#x27;s in 3d and if you&#x27;ve played resident evil 4 video
game, there are a lot of derivations from the game that&#x27;s sure to bring
a few giddy moments. Best of all, every second is a total surprise and
you&#x27;ll have no idea where the movie is going and what is going to
happen next. It never falls flat or meanders at any time. It is solid
and punchy at every second. Even the soundtrack sounds like it&#x27;s
tearing the speakers right off the wall.<br /><br />This is a triumphant action horror movie that oozes with style that
resident evil movies have made their own. The 3d aspect is also quite
impressive but used mostly subtly rather than having things constantly
hurled at your face. The zombies never leap at you or spring their
tendrils at you but every scene with 3d has a subtle vibrancy to it and
3D effects are applied in the set piece fights very well. The plot
probably has a few holes but the movie moves so fast that you barely
have time to think about it or register it. Characters aren&#x27;t that well
flushed out but I suppose every second of character development is one
less zombie killed.<br /><br />This is a great action horror movie and really recommended for people
who found something to like in the older resident evil movies.
