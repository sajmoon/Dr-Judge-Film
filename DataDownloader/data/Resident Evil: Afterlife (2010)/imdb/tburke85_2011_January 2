Resident Evil Afrerlife is okay but not the greatest that has flaws
which I&#x27;ll get into later from writer/director Paul Anderson. It&#x27;s the
fourth film in the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice the unstoppable killing
machine heroine and she&#x27;s perfect as the character who can still kick
some serious ass while looking beautiful doing it. I just wish they had
given her more to do -acting wise- than just killing countless undead
zombies and various monsters (includine one with a giant axe) most
likely created by the Umbrella Corporation. <br /><br />Ali Larter also returns as Claire Redfield from the third film who
joins Alice once again in her quest to find survivors. Larter does what
her role requires and she gets a decent action scene near the end.<br /><br />Wentworth Miller plays Claire&#x27;s brother Chris who unfortunately doesn&#x27;t
really serve any real purpose except as a nod to die Resident Evil game
fans. Miller&#x27;s performance isn&#x27;t that bad it&#x27;s just his character isn&#x27;t
really developed or his relationship with Claire.<br /><br />Shawn Roberts seemed to be doing his best Agent Smith from the Matrix
impression as the villain Albert Wesker unless thats how his character
acts in the games. He gets two scenes the beginning and the end so for
somebody who&#x27;s supposed to be the main villain he&#x27;s not in that much at
all. His fight at the end between Claire and Chris felt anti-climatic.
Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t last very long either. A third act that had
the same problem some other films (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and
Transformers 2 to name a few) did as well when the main bad guy is
easily defeated within a few minutes.<br /><br />The rest of the cast including Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe, and a brief
cameo by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine are okay but none of them
are given any development, substance, or depth.<br /><br />The action sequences are okay but nothing we haven&#x27;t seen before and
there&#x27;s no tension or suspense. The fact that there&#x27;s no humor didn&#x27;t
help either. The zombies are all right despite not getting half as much
screen time as they did in the previous three films. The monster with
the huge Axe was decent despite just showing up with no explanation
something a lot of the creatures do.<br /><br />And what was the purpose of taking away Alice&#x27;s powers early on if it
doesn&#x27;t have any effect at all besides turning her human again? Because
a minute later she somehow survives a plane crash in the mountains and
apparently walks away without a scratch. This just didn&#x27;t make a whole
lot of sense like many other things. I&#x27;m willing to suspend my
disbelief when it comes to movies but only to a point. <br /><br />The ending was predictable and a cameo by a certain character during
the credits seemed a little pointless expect to set up for another
sequel. At 97 minutes Resident Evil Afterlife wasn&#x27;t that bad it just
suffers from the sequel curse by cramming too much into one movie. The
film seemed to be made purely for the action which may please some but
I like to have a compelling story with well developed character, drama,
emotion, suspense, and humor to go along with the spectacle.
