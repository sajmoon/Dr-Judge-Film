The opening and closing scenes are the visual highlights of the latest
addition to this franchise, so don&#x27;t be afraid to go for a bite to eat
in between. You&#x27;ll catch up pretty quick i.e. kill zombie, zombie bad.
OK - perhaps I&#x27;m being a little cruel but the reality is, unless you&#x27;re
a die hard fan of this franchise, you&#x27;ll be left wondering where the
last 2 hours of your life went. Milla Jovovich does what she can to
rescue a weak story line. No 2 scenes really add up, however she is
supported by a largely talented cast. Sadly, any chance of Oscar
nomination (!) is well and truly swallowed up by the movie&#x27;s over
reliance on special effects just for the sake of special effects. One
for the 10 year old.
