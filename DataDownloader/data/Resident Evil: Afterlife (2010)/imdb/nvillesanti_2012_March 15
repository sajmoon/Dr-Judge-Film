Never did I imagine these movies to make it this long, but to my
surprise they have and it looks like they will continue. I did like
Extinction more than Apocalypse, but even I believed it was the end of
the franchise. Then Afterlife comes and, although for me it is not as
good as Extinction, it is quite entertaining and it blends a lot of
elements and themes used in other zombie movies and media.<br /><br />So Afterlife takes off where Extinction left our survivors on their
search for Arcadia, the supposed haven located in Alaska. Alice, in an
attempt to once and for all stop the evil Umbrella Corporation, gathers
her clone army and attacks the Umbrella HQ in Japan. After losing all
her clones in an Akira like nuclear explosion, Alice returns to Alaska
in search for her friends and Arcadia, but she only manages to find
Claire, which seems to be in a stage of amnesia and no Arcadia. Then
she and Claire fly to LA where they find refuge in a large prison
complex which is inhabited by other survivors. But outside the prison,
there are thousands of zombies tirelessly trying to break in the
prison. Alice and the survivor have to figure out a way to escape the
prison and make their way to Arcadia before the prison is finally
overrun by the living dead.<br /><br />The Resident Evil movies are a far cry from the games or themselves. I
did enjoy Afterlife prison idea and there&#x27;s quite a good amount of
zombie action and gore, but it falls flat in terms of story and
screenplay. The characters seem too comic-book like and the story
doesn&#x27;t make much sense at times, but there&#x27;s no denying that this
movie is quite a ride and the zombies are ruthless, specially the one
that carries a giant sledgehammer. Although Milla Jovovich character,
Alice, is not from the game franchise, I think she carries these movies
and they wouldn&#x27;t be the same without her. To this point you can&#x27;t
compare the games and the movies, they are now two different entities
that only share the same title. The F/Xs and visuals are great, the
photography is excellent, and it has a killer soundtrack.<br /><br />I recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife as what it is; a
horror/action/pop-corn movie, nothing more, nothing less. So, if you
love zombie movies or anything related to zombies, check it out.
