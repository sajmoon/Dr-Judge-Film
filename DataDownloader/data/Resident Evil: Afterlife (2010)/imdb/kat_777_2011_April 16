I saw avatar, Gulliver&#x27;s travels, piranha, Chronicles of narnia 4step
up 3 and resident evil 4 so far. I never enjoyed the others the way i
enjoyed this movie. It was incredible and definitely it won&#x27;t be the
same in 2D. <br /><br />Action scenes were amazing. The knifes come directly towards us. The
explosions and everything were really effective.It is also an edge of
the seat thriller. I did not like the first or second as they seemed a
bit poor comparably. <br /><br />Milla Jovovich was as usual fantastic. Ali Larter and everyone else
were good. The music was excellent. It is the kind of movie that you
want to watch over and over again. And it should be experienced in 3D.
