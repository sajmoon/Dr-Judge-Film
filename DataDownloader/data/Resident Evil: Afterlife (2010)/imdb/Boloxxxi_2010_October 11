Alice is trying to track a broadcast from some place called &#x22;Arcadia&#x22;
which promises shelter and sanctuary from the T-virus and the
zombified. She believes there may be other survivors there. Her
adventure while on this quest forms the essential body of the movie.
Her main adversary is the head of the Umbrella Corporation in Tokyo.
This is some guy so hopped up on T-virus that he&#x27;s gone Matrix on
everybody&#x27;s ass. I swear, he acts like a refugee from the movie.<br /><br />My Impression: The movie was entertaining with impressive sets and
visuals. I was never bored.<br /><br />Before I sign off I can&#x27;t resist pointing out a curiosity about the
shoes our heroine was wearing when she first makes her appearance
(which was grand indeed). They kept alternating between heels and flats
(I noticed &#x27;cause I was giving her a good ogling). All I know is that
pumps are a hindrance if you have some athletic ass-kicking to do since
you need speed, balance, and coordination. It&#x27;s as if the director
couldn&#x27;t decide whether or not our heroine should be sexy or practical.
Practical means you have a brain in your head, so it&#x27;s sexy. ---Or
would you rather have a zombie? Love, Boloxxxi.
