2010_September 5 
I am a huge fan of the video game series; I&#x27;ve played &#x26; completed every
Resident Evil game there is and I have 100% trophies of Resident Evil
5.<br /><br />I loved the previous Resident Evil movie trilogy although many fans
were disappointed by them because it wasn&#x27;t to close to the games and
Alice is the main character who isn&#x27;t in any game. The filmmakers can&#x27;t
please everyone when it comes to movies based on video games because if
the movie is very similar to the game then people will say that &#x22;What
is the point of the movie when it is just as same as the game?&#x22; but if
it is very different then people will complain that it is not related
to the game in any way, shape or form. What Paul W.S Anderson has done
is created an original story and had the setting of the game in the
first film &#x26; in this one as well. Which is the best thing to do and he
has proved that he is a terrific writer &#x26; director, he may not be the
best filmmaker ever but he does know how to make good movies based on
games and he is one of my favourite directors. His two movies Mortal
Kombat &#x26; Resident Evil are both the best video game adaptations to
date.<br /><br />The plot of Resident Evil: Afterlife is that it takes place after
Extinction and Alice is continuing to look for survivors in world that
has been infected by T-Virus that has turned into flesh eating zombies
plus she wants to take revenge on Albert Wesker and this time she if
fully prepared with her clones, telekinetic powers and awesome weapons.
Fighting Wesker isn&#x27;t an easy task because he is superhuman himself
just like in Resident Evil 5. This instalment is very close to the
games and particularly Resident Evil Code Veronica &#x26; Resident Evil 5.
Those who have played the 2 games will get flashbacks while watching
the movie.<br /><br />This was the most anticipated film for me this year and it absolutely
did not disappoint me at all. I loved every minute of it right from
start to end. Resident Evil: Afterlife was relentlessly entertaining,
exiting and a perfect popcorn movie at the cinema kind. The movie had a
great blend of action, horror, sci-fi and thriller. This one had a much
more post-apocalyptic look than in extinction and has amazing special &#x26;
visual effects in just in a $60 million budget. The monsters were just
like in Resident Evil 5, e.g. the zombies look like the majini&#x27;s with
their predator like mouth, the executioner and the dogs that split
their heads open with teeth inside it. So it was fascinating to see
that.<br /><br />The cast was great, Milla needs no introduction &#x26; is fantastic just
like always and she is improving in acting, stunts and she doesn&#x27;t
struggle to get the job done because she can do it. Shawn Roberts was a
much better Albert Wesker than Jason O&#x27;Mara in Extinction.<br /><br />Overall it&#x27;s not an Oscar winning kind movie &#x26; it doesn&#x27;t need to be.
It&#x27;s a movie for the fans not for critics so ignore their negative
reviews but I had a really good time watching it since I am a fan and
check it out if you&#x27;re looking for an entertaining movie and it&#x27;s a
must see if you are a Resident Evil fan.
