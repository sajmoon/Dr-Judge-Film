Or something. I don&#x27;t know. Something needs to be done. That&#x27;s two bad
Resident Evil movies in a row.<br /><br />There&#x27;s something about these last two Resident Evil movies that are
lacking. There&#x27;s this weird sense of bland, hollowness as you&#x27;re
watching it. Nothing about it engages you, it leaves you feeling like a
distant spectator. I was bored out of my mind.<br /><br />There&#x27;s just no feeling of purpose or goal. The characters are just
wandering from scene to scene, with some vague sense of some nebulous
destination in the near future, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel significant.
The relationships between the characters are never fully explored, such
as between Chris and Claire Redfield, and you just generally don&#x27;t care
about anything that&#x27;s going on, you&#x27;re just &#x22;watching.&#x22; <br /><br />I like the inclusion of Michael Scofield, and his being &#x22;broken out of
prison.&#x22; Nice nod to the Prison Break series, of which only the first
two seasons count, as everything after that are just abominations to
mankind in its purest form.
