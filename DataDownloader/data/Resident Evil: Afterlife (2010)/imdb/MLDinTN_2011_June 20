I like the Resident Evil movies, but this one had no plot. It&#x27;s
basically Alice and her friends shooting guns at zombies and using some
Matrix style fighting. How did Alice get gas to fly the plane and what
happened to all her clones after the beginning of the movie? And who
was the bad guy with the sun glasses? Well, I guess none of that really
matters as long as Alice is able to find a stash of guns along the way.
How about when they get through into the sewer system, next shot is
them on a boat out to the Arcadia. How did they get the boat, 15
minutes seemed to be missing. And Arcadia was disappointing, at least
they could have had some mean mutant monster made by Umbrella on there.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Adds nothing, skip it.
