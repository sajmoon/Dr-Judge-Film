Yes, its the best 3D movie till date (better than Avatar). It could
have been the best Zombie movie, but the zombiness was missing. Ha !
but who cares, its still the best action movie of this year. The
Resident Evil series is getting better and better.This is Paul
Anderson&#x27;s best work till date.The timing of the 3D effects is perfect
(this what we expect from a 3D movie, rather than watching birds flying
and Blue men running in a 2 and a half hour Avatar, just like another
Discovery channel Bird show)<br /><br />Why you should watch this movie ?<br /><br />1. Best in the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />2. Top class use of 3D, stylish,great music, awesome slow mo actions
and scary. <br /><br />3. One of the best Zombie movie. <br /><br />4. No boring zone.<br /><br />After Angelina Jolie , its Mila Jovovich .
