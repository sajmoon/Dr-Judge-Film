This movie may have a crappy story plot which is simple but it&#x27;s still
entertaining if your into this sort of genre , basically Alice&#x27;s main
objective in this movie is to get to Arcadia which continues from the
3rd Resident evil, The 3D FX in this movie is kinda blurry but still
good, the music does a great job by making this movie more entertaining
it perfectly describes the the whole mood of the movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are fun to watch which is basically the only thing
that this movie has going for it, the thing i hated though was how
horrible the story plot was it wasn&#x27;t really that interesting and it
could have been Soooooooooooo much better there&#x27;s so much potential for
this movie to really be good and they could of made it longer too and
if your un- familiar with the game you might not understand it as much
since the plot does a bad job of explaining core story elements of the
real games story line i know the movie is not meant to follow the game
exactly but it left out some key things that are needed to explain the
story properly.<br /><br />Two really great things about this movies Milla and Ali look banging
hot and yet have this dominating aura around them which doesn&#x27;t make
them too over sexualised which is awesome.
