Easily it will be ridiculous to expect &#x27;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x27; to be
anything more than the other films in terms of quality. Here the
zombies have mutated into nameless monsters and our heroine, Alice
(Milla Jovovich) once again finds herself as a sole warrior battling
them until she finds Claire (Ali Larter) in circumstances different
from when she last saw her. Together the two find a few other survivors
but the zombie population has expanded exponentially and there is only
one escape. I enjoyed Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x27; more than the third
one. The fight sequences are fun to watch (even though they&#x27;re nothing
new) and the mutated monsters are a refreshing addition. Jovovich is
obviously very comfortable playing Alice and she is supported well by
Ali Larter. I&#x27;m not saying they gave phenomenal performance but rather
they do the best one could do with such roles in such films. The
special effects are good and this one has more energy than its
prequels. It&#x27;s popcorn fun and I can imagine it&#x27;s more entertaining in
3D.
