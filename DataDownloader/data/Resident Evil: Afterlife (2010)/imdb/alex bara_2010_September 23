Well i have always loved the resident evil game series. The first three
movies were good but this was awesome. But sadly i didn&#x27;t get to see it
in 3D. The action sequences, zombies , the axeman ,the sets were all up
to the mark.The story also attracted me coz it differed from the game .
Then why i didn&#x27;t give it a 10 ??? My only disappointment was that my
favourite villain ALBERT WESKER had very little time to show off his
superhuman abilities. The director could have added more of his fight
sequences with ALICE. Also the ending rung the bells in my mind as if
asking &#x22;WHAT??? MORE IS YET TO COME&#x22;. ALL IN ALL a good entertainer a
must watch in 3D.
