In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the
whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson
actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original
he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights
like Neo&#x27;s twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind &#x22;Blade 2&#x22;,
whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of
the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very
memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the
movie (especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight).<br /><br />There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie, but that
has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slash-em-up fun.
Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very
likable heroine, so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper
screen time and a couple of intriguing fights, than the movie just
never seems to feel like a waste of time.
