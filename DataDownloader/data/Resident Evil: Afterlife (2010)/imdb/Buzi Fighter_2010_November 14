Its hard to write an accurate review of what I just saw in this movie.
A mix of all kind, that are irrelevant to the plot. Storyline is lost
in a sequence of zombie attacks, where in you find that some mutants
have even evolved. They wear a hood and a huge Axe. Mila tries to act
here, but you do notice she isn&#x27;t giving her best. I don&#x27;t blame her,
because the script has no end. Never ending resident evil...zombies,
umbrella, blade 3 villain theft. I do believe this would make an
awesome series, but to make sequel after a sequel, it loses its
freshness. I like Mila, but Alice here looked like a soccer mom
fighting those zombies!<br /><br />Lame Matrix moves compel me to give this movie a 4/10 because we&#x27;ve
seen this before. Still, no true conclusion in this episode.
