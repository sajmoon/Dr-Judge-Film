I&#x27;m kinda into Mila thanks to her movie debut with Bruce Willis and I
kinda enjoy the Resident Evil general concept. With those two thoughts
in mind I settled in for this title. What I was hoping for was a decent
production. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />It&#x27;s just... plain dumb an poorly executed. I really, really tried to
enjoy this movie as I was watching it with my fianc&#xE9;e who likes the
series. And this one left both of us with a bad taste in our mouth.<br /><br />The action scenes are inconsequent both in quality and pace, they lack
flair or finesse. I find it insulting when every possible scene of the
film is easily predictable (just as the final outcome).<br /><br />What is more - this part of the Resident Evil universe seemed to me as
a prequel, not a sequel. The ending firmly established the plot for
another production and does it in a way, which I find embarrassing.<br /><br />I could try to write about the plot, but it would just end in me
smacking each and every part of it with a big hammer. Alongside with
bashing Wentworth Miller for absolute lack of any acting skill, as he
seemed to me to be Michael Scofield pasted into this universe. Well...
with shooting added.<br /><br />There are no twists (well, for anybody above age 6), humor is
non-existent and the actions scenes are surreal in their dumbness,
poorly directed and simply boring.<br /><br />To be honest, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a movie worth missing.<br /><br />The one and only good part of the movie is the main actress herself. I
find Mila a very beautiful (in a unique and intriguing way) woman.<br /><br />And I suggest watching &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; to experience that. It will
be fun, exactly the opposite to Resident Evil: Afterlife.
