Absolutely hated it. I&#x27;ve played every game, followed the stories and I
HATED the first three movies. I thought I might actually like this one
but I was wrong . . . This movie is regurgitated Resident Evil 5. There
are some parts that are literally taken from that game word for word
and several sequences identical to the game. I spent almost the entire
movie waiting for something exciting to happen and it never came. I
suppose someone must&#x27;ve given them an infinite ammo code too. How many
times did Alice fire her S&#x26;W 500 revolvers (a five shot revolver)
without reloading? Maybe I&#x27;m being overly critical because I know a
thing or two about guns and the people who made this film obviously
knew NOTHING . . . I could go on and on about why I say that but I&#x27;ll
spare you. Probably what upset me the most was that they FINALLY put
Chris Redfield in a movie and gave him a small sidekick role! Stop
making these garbage movies and calling them Resident Evil!
