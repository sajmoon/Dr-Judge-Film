Among the recent horror titles, Resident Evil: Afterlife maybe an
entertaining film. It is fast paced and action packed, and it does
provide some enjoyment if you let your brain stop working for an hour
and a half.<br /><br />Plot holes are everywhere. Why is everybody suddenly possess all kinds
of superhuman abilities like jumping over a meter high, sliding
everywhere, while they are not supposed to, except to pay homage to the
video game RE4 and RE5 which normal human having superior power. The
homages to RE4 and RE5 may also make watchers who are not fans feel
absurd since many things are left unexplained, such as what is that
giant monster exactly?<br /><br />But what vexes me most is the rip-offs, which are everywhere. Come on
are you serious? The opening scenes are from the Matrix. The landing
scene is from Escape from New York. Signs on the roof? Thats from Dawn
of the Dead remake! Jumping off the roof? Die Hard of course.<br /><br />Afterall, if you just want some mind-numbing B-movie, give it a try.
