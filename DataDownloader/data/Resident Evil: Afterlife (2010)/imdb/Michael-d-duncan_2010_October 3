First off I am a fan of the franchise and I loved playing the games.
The Good, Bad.<br /><br />First the Bad<br /><br />The previous movies had really left the writers in a strange place so
the first twenty minutes of this film was them trying to recapture the
storyline and the audience (which probably didn&#x27;t bother to rent other
films) really suffers for lack of a unified story. This makes my first
beef with this film. Second, the movie didn&#x27;t have zombies! It was
about 90% action movie and 10% zombie movie, the other films did a much
better job of balancing that out. Third, the previous two films did a
good job of setting up the villain with an unction / drive, this one
really drops the bomb on that. The head villain, (if you&#x27;re familiar
with RE3) is not new but he has no back story and his murderous, cold
blooded, i-wear-my-sun-glasses-at-night persona is just kinda random
and stressed. The other villain, that freaky lookin&#x27; ax dude from the
preview just shows up out of nowhere also!<br /><br />Now the Good: The film is entertaining, not worth the premium for 3d
and not worth the IMAX price, but certainly worth a rent and a bowl of
popcorn. Second: the writers feel free to experiment and manipulate the
zombie genre; too often Zflilms are the same recycled plot dipped in a
bucket of red corn syrup. Even if I would have liked a few more zombie
scenes, I can respect the importance of branching out and expanding the
genre. <br /><br />Bottom Line: If you enjoyed the other films, don&#x27;t miss it. Don&#x27;t go
dropping $15 bucks for a ticket but it&#x27;s a good show with some nice
action. All in all pretty fun.
