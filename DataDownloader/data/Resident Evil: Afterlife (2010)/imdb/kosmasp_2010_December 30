Just when you think it&#x27;s all over, a new Resident Evil pops up. And
this time it&#x27;s 3-D too. It does continue the story where the 3rd left
off, but it does leave a few question marks, that might not be revealed
in this movie. Will Millas character finally set an end to it all
though? You have to watch this to know for sure.<br /><br />The action is shot well and you even get a character from the Resident
Evil 5 video game. A very big one that is, but wait til you see it (if
you haven&#x27;t been spoiled by the trailer that is). It is more the action
than anything, that elevates this above the 5/10 mark for me. Of course
you might feel it deserves more or less. It&#x27;s not about the rating.
It&#x27;s about how entertained you are going to be. And therein lies the
difference between quite a few people (or their feelings towards the
Resident Evil series)
