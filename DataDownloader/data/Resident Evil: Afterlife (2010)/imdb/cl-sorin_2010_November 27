This has got to be the worst resident evil so far. there is no story,
some action scenes are kinda stupid, and don&#x27;t judge me wrong, i like a
good action movie and am a huge fan of the resident evil trilogy, but
this...OK 3D,wow, big deal! you can&#x27;t base a movie only on the 3D
element and some cool camera movement+stop motion. this movie just
doesn&#x27;t live up to the resident evil name :(. The good thing is that,
if they shoot a sequel, they can&#x27;t go any more wrong. there were lots
of other things and one of them was that in some slow motion scenes,
the characters&#x27; movement was a little strange (they really didn&#x27;t seem
to be running/jumping). if you are going to see this movie, see it in
3D...makes it less disappointing i guess.
