Properly the funniest teen movie of 1999!<br /><br />Seann William Scott, Jason Biggs and Eddie Kaye Thomas are amazing in
this
teen movie about one boy and his pie.<br /><br />If you've ever been in teen love then this is the film for you.<br /><br />Funny yet somehow serious one of the best teen movies since The Breakfast
Club.<br /><br />For any teen movie lover this is the film for you!
