Another plane movie. &quot;American Pie&quot; was R(A) in Singapore (21 and over to
enter). I was 14 when I saw this (I'm 15 now, and I'm sure that required so
much Maths skills). With my mom beside me. She was, of course, mortified
that I was laughing at some of the scenes, but oh well.<br /><br />Okay. &quot;American Pie&quot; is a funny movie, no doubt. I think it's rather
hilarious, and um, Jason Biggs is funny, but if you ask me to describe the
plot, I'm not sure if I can do that. Because 1) I can't remember half the
movie and 2) there isn't a plot. &quot;American Pie&quot; is just a comedy with lots
of sex. That's all there is to it. It requires no thinking skills, or even
any apprehending skills. Perfect in-flight movie, considering the other junk
they showed (like oh, &quot;Sweet November&quot;), and perfect cure for boredom. The
funniest scene is the Jim (Jason Biggs' character, I'm not sure of his name)
and the Pie scene; absolutely had me in fits. And Jim's dad is hilarious as
well. Alyson Hanningan is SO irritating. Can she just stop doing the nerd
roles, because quite honestly, I can't tell the difference between Alyson in
&quot;American Pie&quot; and Alyson in, say, &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;, or even &quot;Buffy&quot;.
Besides all of that, I cannot remember anything else.<br /><br />Definitely one of the better &quot;teen movies&quot; (funny that it was rated R(A), as
I don't consider people over 21 &quot;teens&quot;), but not one of the more memorable
movies released that year, whatever year it was. Or maybe it's just me.
