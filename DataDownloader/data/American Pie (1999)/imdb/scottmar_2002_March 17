I usually avoid high school sex comedies. They're usually very pretentious,
obnoxious, and bare little resemblance to reality.
I finally saw this much talked about movie, and it is pretty much what I
expected. I couldn't beleive that in the documentary on the DVD, the cast
members were saying the movie was just like high school. I don't know what
school they went to, but it seems to me most people in high school are angst
ridden and depressed.
The surprising thing for me was how unfunny the movie was. There was a
couple of amusing moments, most notably from Eugene Levy and Willow (Band
Camp girl.) Only once, just once, did I laugh out loud.<br /><br />And that was when the guy watching the streaming video said &quot;Go trig boy,
it's your birthday&quot;. That's funny. Totally silly. Probably wasn't even in
the script, just improvised.
