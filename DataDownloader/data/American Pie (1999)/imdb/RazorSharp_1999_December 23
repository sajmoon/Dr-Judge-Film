&quot;American Pie&quot; is not you average teen flick. It's reputation for being
raunchy and outrageous is totally justified, given the fact that it does
refer to, and sometimes show, everything involved with sex, from bodily
fluids to masturbation to using food as a a metaphor for third base. It's
sort of like a &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; touched with &quot;There's
Something About Mary&quot; grossness. Believe it or not, this film is
relentlessly honest when it examines teen guys, with their consistently
raging hormones, driving them to explore just about everything. Yeah, it
does get a bit silly at times, but is also, strangely, illuminates alot of
information about teens adults don't know about, or probaly don't wanna
believe. But it's not like the lead characters are one-dimensional youths
trying to get laid, there are actually some touching moments near the end
where they come to realisation that relationships and love will always be
more fulfilling than scoring. &quot;American Pie&quot; manages to successfully combine
hilarious toilet-humour with warmth, and it owes a lot of credit towards the
performances, everyone showcases potential, including Jason Biggs. Okay, so
it's gags do get a but tiresome, and some character's don't develop well,
but overall &quot;American Pie&quot; is a teen comedy worth watching.
