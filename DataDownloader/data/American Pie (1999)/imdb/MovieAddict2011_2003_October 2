Characters can make or break a movie, and this goes especially for &quot;American
Pie,&quot; a rude, crude, and downright raunchy film that would probably be
considered one of the worst of the decade if not for the film's obvious love
of its characters and their shortcomings and exploits.<br /><br /> Some of the best of all comedies are so simply because they treat their
characters with such loving affection - from works of comedy such as
&quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; to more dark and brooding comedies like
&quot;Fargo.&quot; Without love of characters there is a lack of respect, a film goes
nowhere and an audience senses both and disregards it. A film like &quot;American
Pie&quot; may not be the best of all films but I laughed, not so much at the gags
but rather because the characters taking part in the gags seemed pretty darn
infectious and sweet. Beneath the crudeness there's a heart - you just may
have to dig through some waste to get there.<br /><br /> The film lacks the honesty and realism of teenagers that made John Hughes'
80s films so appealing to audiences - this is more or less a routine
sex-and-prom teen comedy - but, like I said, the characters make up for
this. It's about four graduating teenagers - Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris
Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) - who
make a pact to have sex by prom night. Bring the whole family to this one -
you'll have a ball!<br /><br /> A pretty immature and borderline basic plot we have that is put to pretty
good use through some crazy - though immature - antics. The title of the
film is more than just a figure of speech. There's a scene where a foreign
exchange student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth, not to be confused with
Elizabeth Shannon of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) undresses in the Biggs
character's room and *everything* is broadcasted across the Internet. I
can't divulge into anything else because I'm writing for family websites.
But let me say that if you think &quot;Austin Powers&quot; had a mouthful of
innuendos, &quot;American Pie&quot; has that plus some. (It's sad to think that they
had to guarantee an R-rating by inserting nudity and constant language - is
the MPAA so ignorant that without nudity a film crammed with sexual innuendo
like this would be PG-13?) We also get to learn the meaning of the word,
&quot;MILF.&quot;<br /><br /> I really can't say very much about this movie, or even go into its plot any
further. All I can say is that I laughed. I liked the characters. I liked
the innocence of blunders; that the characters often do things and humiliate
themselves but not on purpose like in some comedies. But what holds me back
from giving this a great rating is that the content is a bit too strong even
for those 17, which the MPAA finds a suitable age to view this (it makes
promiscuity seem all the more nerdy; the characters never consider the after
effects of their night of passion). It is a very typical and cliched teen
sex comedy, in a way, which holds back my rating a bit. It is a pretty funny
film, no doubt, but the basis and outcome are both very typical. It makes
one laugh while at the same time wishing Ferris Bueller - an intelligent,
resourceful, sneaky teenager whose mind was not cliched and always focused
on sex - would return. Where's John Hughes when you need him?<br /><br /> 3.5/5 stars -<br /><br />
