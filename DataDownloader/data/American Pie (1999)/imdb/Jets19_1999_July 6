1999_July 6 

I just saw a sneak preview of this film, and it's difficult to try to place
it.  It is definitely unlike the recent slew of teen movies that Hollywood
seems to be churning out.  Why?  Well, for starters it has characters who
each and every person can honestly relate to, not simply the caricatures
which are so frequently featured on screen nowadays.  It has a couple of
incredibly risque sight gags, one of which puts the infamous hair gel scene
in &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; to shame.  But the biggest reason it
stands out is that it reminds me more of the classic 80's teen films
(updated in content for the 90's, of course) than any of the cookie cutter
90's teen films have...by far.  This is &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;
fixed
up for a new generation.  It unabashedly deals with teenage hormones and
masturbation, and is unafraid to show it.  Unlike the awful &quot;Cruel
Intentions&quot;, which tried to make teens appear over-experienced and sexy
(failing miserably), &quot;American Pie&quot; beautifully illustrates the awkwardness
and anticipation surrounding the loss of the big V and the trials of teen
hormones and sexual frustration.  I highly recommend.  It'll have you
rolling on the floor laughing, both from what's on screen and recognition
of
the humor of your own first time.
