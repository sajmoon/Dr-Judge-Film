&quot;American Pie&quot; should be better known to the world as &quot;the comedy that
launched 1,000 terrible movies.&quot; This is the film that slapped a
sticker on the genre &quot;Teen Comedy&quot; and convinced movie producers
everywhere that the way to attract the overpaying audience of teenagers
is to give them movies focused around sex and sex jokes. While
&quot;American Pie&quot; certainly deserves that rep, lost in it all is what
makes &quot;American Pie&quot; better than all those movies (including those of
the same name that followed it). This is a comedy that despite
glorifying teenage sex, has an sense of genuineness that anyone who has
graduated high school can&#39;t deny and that&#39;s what makes it stand out.<br /><br />The film follows four friends who make a pact to help each other lose
their virginity by prom night. Nice, simple and vulgar. What makes the
comedy tick is that these friends are all different and attached to
teenage stereotypes. Naturally, they find themselves in situations with
women that come into conflict with these stereotypes or make for
comedic opposites. This is a character-focused gag comedy. It&#39;s not
slapstick, but all about gags making you empathize even more with these
characters. While it&#39;s all very formulaic, it works somehow. You laugh
and yet you have some vested interest in what becomes of the
characters.<br /><br />Credit to writer Adam Herz for creating such memorable characters,
though the actors themselves are half the success. Director Paul Weitz
knows when the script is at its strongest and helps get these young
actors to make some believable stuff despite their insensitive hijinx.
Somehow, he gets a believable performance out of Chris Klein, for
example, who plays Oz, the jock who decides to &quot;extend himself.&quot;
Normally he&#39;d seem like a junky character, but his unlikely
relationship with Mena Suvari&#39;s character works despite just an OK
script.<br /><br />Most importantly, it must be stated that this film kind of operates
with the liberal mindset of those who understand teenage sex happens so
you might as well make it into something funny. To its credit, the film
does address issues of safe sex and being in love and having sex, but
that&#39;s not to say the film addresses moral issues, because quite
frankly, it doesn&#39;t hold them with high regard.<br /><br />So as much as I want to hate &quot;American Pie&quot; for all the stereotypes and
formula work, there is a lot of strong work being done with this film.
It has terrific characters and most importantly a sense of being true
to real life--though only the real life of one who accepts teenage sex
as part of real life. The fact that Weitz was able to get these great
performances out of a bunch of 19 and 20-year-olds is really
impressive. So despite all the ridiculous gags and unnecessary jokes
and bad movies the followed, &quot;American Pie&quot; really does work on a
higher level and deserves to recognized for its contribution to pop
culture (The term MILF has transformed the porn industry) and the
comedy genre.
