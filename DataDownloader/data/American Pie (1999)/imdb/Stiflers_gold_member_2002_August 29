Back in 1999, when this movie first came out, not many people were into
the
raunchy teen sex comedy bit like before. So the Weisz Bros. decided to
revisit that genre and add some of the most outrageous stunts shown in a
movie of it's kind. I mean, this IS the only movie where you get to see a
guy arouse himself with a warm apple pie. Or another guy drink
sperm-tainted
beer. I fell out of my seat laughing in &quot;the bedroom scene&quot;. It's a well
done movie and one I have seen several times already. This is the teen sex
comedy that actually is good. My advice. See it, don't regret it, and
laugh
at the stupid parts. The pie rides high, baby!
