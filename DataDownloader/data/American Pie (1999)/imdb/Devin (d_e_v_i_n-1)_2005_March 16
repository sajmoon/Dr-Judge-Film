American Pie is the 1999 surprise smash hit comedy by director Paul
Weitz. Jim played by Jason Biggs is one of the main characters and his
inexperience with women leads him to experiment with warm baked goods.
If you have ever wondered why this film has its title then lets just
say that you will never look at an apple pie with a straight face
again. American Pie is like a breath of fresh air compared to the
recent high school based comedies, it is very clever.<br /><br />Jim's dad always seems to appear at the most inappropriate moments to
embarrass Jim. His dad is also quite interested in teaching Jim about
the ways of the world which adds a lot of humor to the film. Like
&quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, American Pie is on of the few recent
comedies that is funny throughout. From the opening &quot;Illegal Channels&quot;
scenes to the climatic Prom, American Pie delivers. One way of judging
a comedy is also by how funny it is when watched a few times. Well
American Pie stands up to that test, as it is still funny after
repeated viewing 7/10
