1999_July 18 

I decided to see this movie at the last minute, because &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;
was so long, the last showing at the theater was 7:45pm.  I was not
disappointed at all.  This movie has laughs all 'round, most of them coming
from the supporting cast, including Allison Hannigan's &quot;Band Camp Geek&quot;, and
Eugene Levy.  The lines they say were as funny, if not more funny, than the
visual jokes in the film.  I've seen three high school films in a row this
year, including &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, and this movie
showed high school the way it is, rather than the way it should be.  If you
want a good sex comedy in the &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; vein, &quot;American
Pie&quot; is for you.  Besides, who wants to see Nicole Kidman naked in some
boring film anyway, when you could be laughing at sex!?
