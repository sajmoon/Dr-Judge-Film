This would have to be one of THE worst films ever. Yep, it's down there with
Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Although amusing AT TIMES, at others, this really has you staring at the
ceiling. I would go as far as to say that Stalin's 1950's propaganda films
would be more enthralling than American Pie.<br /><br />Definietly one for teenage girls.<br /><br />2/10.
