1999_October 6 

I saw this film yesterday. It has a 15+ rating and when buying my ticket, I
was asked how old I was (I'm 20). Anyway, my friends and I were surrounded
by a pack of practically pre-pubescent &quot;I just turned fifteen today&quot;
year-olds.<br /><br />I had heard that this movie was shocking, and not for the weak-of-stomach.
But I should have realised that with it's rating, it couldn't be too &quot;out
there&quot;.<br /><br />I admit that I did find the movie amusing, and it was interesting to see
Alyson Hannigan outside of Buffy. But I did feel old, and the camera-work
made me feel a bit dizzy. Having all the conversations filmed directly from
the perspective of the non-talking participant meant way too many
close-ups,
and I started to wonder about that perpetually stray strand of hair of
Oz's,
and the lack of subtlety as regards the guy's eye make-up.<br /><br />Some scenes seemed totally unbelievable. I don't think anyone I know would
start masturbating in a virtually unknown guy's bedroom, while they were
'getting changed'. I also don't see how it's acceptable to show a lithe
female naked except for a pair of lacy undies, when the male equivalent is
a
flaccid youth with disturbing boxers.<br /><br />Basically, it was a funny movie, but I wouldn't really class it as
shocking.
I guess I've grown up since I've left high school.
