There is probably a good bit of each of us somewhere in the characters
and
situations presented in American Pie.  I found watching it to be a
bittersweet experience as it dredged up a lot of memories from my own high
school days.  I think the way the story is presented and the skill of the
cast helped portray this in a fun and entertaining way.  Overall, I think
it
is a good movie and well worth the rental (or purchase).
