Rated R for strong sexuality, crude sexual dialogue, language and
drinking, all involving teens.<br /><br />I saw this film about 6 years ago on TV when I was 9 years old.I then
re-watched it yesterday having now been a teenager.My favorite teen
film of all time is &quot;Superbad&quot;.Its hilarious and realistic.Fast Times
At Ridgemont High is the best teen film of the 1980&#39;s.I suppose this is
the best teen film of the 90&#39;s but it wasn&#39;t all that great.I mean it
was very funny and entertaining but nothing special.Its about four
friends who try losing their virginity before prom night.I think this
film brought back the teen sex comedy genre from the 1980&#39;s.Its a funny
and good movie.It was better than the second American Pie which was
still good.I have yet to see the third but I will soon enough.If you
want to watch a very good &quot;teen sex comedy&quot; watch &quot;The Last American
Virgin&quot;.
