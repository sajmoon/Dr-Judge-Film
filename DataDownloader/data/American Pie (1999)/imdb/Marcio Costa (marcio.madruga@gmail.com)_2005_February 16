For people who rent a tape (or DVD) for fun, it is a great movie. I is
tasteless, gross, it makes you laugh a lot, sometimes from good jokes
and situations, sometimes from being nervous our grossed out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some people go see films like star wars (or trek) and
come out from the theater commenting how some physics laws were broken,
or if a laser saber can cut -or not- a steel post. Movies are for fun,
the spectator is expected to be in the mood for the fun the film can
offer. American Pie trilogy is a great comedy, with all we can expect:
some good acting among an average cast, some intelligent jokes among
the obvious, and very good role playing: One could quickly learn to
like (or hate) the characters. Even the people who watched the movies
on their releases (with 2-year intervals), would remember the roles and
the history in the very first scenes. All three films are happy ending,
cheerful and light, and worthy.
