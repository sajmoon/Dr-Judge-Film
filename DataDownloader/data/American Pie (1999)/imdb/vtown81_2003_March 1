If you looking for an intelligent, well-though-out script with witty humor,
top-notch acting and a flowing story line, don't rent this movie, but if you
looking for a movie that is a satarical look at puberty and will create some
deep belly laughs, then look no further.  Although there is one character
that ends up developing a deep relationship, by accident, this movie is all
about a bunch of high school boys scheming to get laid.  There are some very
memorable scenes that you will never forget.
