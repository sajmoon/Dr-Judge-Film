1999_July 7 

This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made.  The writing is
absolutely outstanding.  Each joke is carefully set up early in the script
and paid off at the proper time.<br /><br />Although, not for everyone because of the theme and execution, this film
will go down as one of the funniest movies ever made.  No longer will
&quot;Porky's&quot; be considered the king of gross out, youth movies.<br /><br />This is just more proof that 50 million dollars and bankable cast is
necessary for a theatrical release.  All it takes is talent and
originality.
