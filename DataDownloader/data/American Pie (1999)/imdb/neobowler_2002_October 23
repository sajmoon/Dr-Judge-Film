This movie is definitely something that people should see. The humor is a
particular taste, but it brings to light something good about sex.
Admittedly some of the things done in this movie are out-there, but they
are
just so funny to see. I think the Adam Herz has definitely experienced
some
of this. Whoever casted this film did a great job. Jason Biggs and
Seann-William Scott are absolutely hilarious. I think Mena Suvari stands
out
as doing the best job. Eugene Levy is hilarious as well. The only thing I
didn't like was Eddie Kaye Thomas, not that he did a bad job I just
thought
he could have done better. I think that everyone should see this, to know
what teenage sexuality is like.
