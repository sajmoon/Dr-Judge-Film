Allow me to review Mena Suvari's second &quot;American&quot; 99 movie. While not as
dramatic, well written, acted, or even thought out as Beauty, Pie has an
endearing charm that I cannot deny. An obvious throwback to the days of
Sixteen candles and Pretty in Pink, Pie does things that Hughes would never
take. and do you know why he wouldn't take them. because they are crude and
disgusting. Sort of funny, but really crude and disgusting. There are better
movies in the genre out there (there's something about Mary immediately
springs to mind), but if your home on a Saturday afternoon with cable, give
it a go. You'll be glad/disgusted you did.
