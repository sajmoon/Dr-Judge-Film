One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, this movie focuses on
4 friends whose mission is to lose their virginity by prom night. The fact
that each character was created so realistically made this movie familiar.
With good writing, this movie proves to be much better than others like it.
Through each scene, it's hard not to laugh...a lot.<br /><br />*** of **** stars. <br /><br />
