If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the
glory of teen sex, you may well view &quot;American Pie&quot; as yet another in a
long
line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization.  If,
however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending
coitus
interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though
admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a
plot
involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to
lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as
&quot;prom night.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous
examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens
will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real
thing.  An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of
their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the
characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with,
rather than condemns, their antics.<br /><br />As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily
promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative
prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is certainly not for every taste and there are those who
would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for
already sex-obsessed teenagers.  Be that as it may, the film provides a
fair
number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of
backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have
all, at one time, experienced.<br /><br />I do have one troubling question though:  why do none of these characters,
whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever
lock
a door?  The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half
the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve.  For this
film, at least, such a suspension of disbelief may be a
prerequisite.<br /><br />Be forewarned but enjoy!
