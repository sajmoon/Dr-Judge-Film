When I saw this movie last summer in Boston, I did not know what to expect
at all. To say the least, I was positively surprised! Featuring an almost
unknown cast, American Pie makes for good fun. The story about about the
four guys trying to &quot;score&quot; is extremely entertaining when you see how
much
they try to be successful in their quest for losing their
virginities.
I recommend this to everyone between the ages 15 - 55!
