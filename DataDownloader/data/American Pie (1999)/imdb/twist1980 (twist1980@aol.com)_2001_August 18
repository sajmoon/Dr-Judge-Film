American Pie is so true to life.  I saw it three times in the theater when
it came out and I just bought it a few weeks ago.  The more times I watch
it, the more I relate to it.  It's great to see a &quot;teen movie&quot; thats so
true
to life.  Most of the teen movies out there are sugar coated or they only
relate to a minor aspect of teenage life.  This movie came out after my
senior year, and I saw it with a bunch of my friends from high school.
Everything that happens reflects the way that guys and girls think.
Besides
being true to life, this movie is hilarious...everyone should see it.
Forget about the rating, it is actually most suited for high school and
college aged.
