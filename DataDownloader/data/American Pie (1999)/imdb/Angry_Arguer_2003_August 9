Author's Note: I saw this movie at the behest of a friend who thinks I
haven't seen anything good.  &quot;Cameron Frye, this one's for
you!&quot;<br /><br />While comedies are not my forte (I do not believe in the purpose of
devoting
a whole movie to that purpose), this movie only solidifies my hate of the
modern Hollywood machine.  I'm certain if John Hughes ever watched this
he'd
be thinking, &quot;You know, I was competing against the same crap 20 years
ago.&quot;<br /><br />American Pie's biggest blunder is that it relies too much on insulting the
intelligence of the audience in exchange for breaking ground.  This is
what
made such movies as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Breakfast Club
superior.  What makes such things as Monty Python and Dr. Strangelove so
ENORMOUSLY superior is that they don't think the audience is stupid enough
to walk into their movie to begin with.<br /><br />The ultimate victim is the so-called &quot;heroes&quot; themselves because they are
cardboard prop-ups of the typical American high school teenage.  What are
they thinking about besides sex?  Not only is this unrealistic, but it
insults every other stereotype throw into the mix.  I am certain that if
MTV
executives got ahold of this movie they wouldn't change anything about
it.<br /><br />Overall, there you have it folks.  An insulting, degrading, and
outrageously
stupid movie.  With so many better flicks out there (try CLERKS instead)
it
is a wonder why you should waste your time with this.  Stick with Fast
Times
instead.  0 out of 5 stars.
