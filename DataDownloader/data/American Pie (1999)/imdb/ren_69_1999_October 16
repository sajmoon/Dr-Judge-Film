1999_October 16 

This movie is a load of laughs. I'm sorry, but to anyone who hated this
movie, you were taking it too seriously or it just wasn't your cup of tea.
I'm a 21 year old university student and I expected a fun movie and that's
exactly what I got. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's
a gross-out film with a moral conscience, though it perhaps lays it on a tad
too thick. I don't want to give away too much, but alot of the things that
occur are just implausible and ridiculous. And that's why I found it a
barrel of laughs. You'll find yourself laughing along with the characters,
while some moments will make you squirm and force you to ask yourself, 'Did
that ever happen to me?' It's a question many of us may not like the answer
to. This is a fun film that I think should be seen by those who are out of
school, rather than those still there. It's also good to see Eugene Levy
again.
