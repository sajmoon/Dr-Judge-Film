OK, so I'm pushing 30 and I missed the big whoop about American Pie<br /><br />when it released.  I've just caught it on DVD, expecting to detest it,<br /><br />but to my amazement, it left me smiling.<br /><br />American Pie is primarily a morality tale, with the message that good<br /><br />things (eventually) happen to good people.  This is not at all what I<br /><br />expected.  People who were scandalised by American Pie should really<br /><br />take a look at the similarly themed classic Animal House, and ask<br /><br />themselves which one delivers a more wholesome message.<br /><br />American Pie is an effective, if slightly heavy handed comedy.  The<br /><br />scatological humour is unnecessary (and I mean that in a good way),<br /><br />but is fairly well handled.  The delivery and timing of all the leads<br /><br />is exemplary, even if most of them look a little long in the tooth to<br /><br />be high schoolers.<br /><br />As to the &quot;gross out&quot; elements, they are only a little more extreme<br /><br />than in the crop of 1980's &quot;bad kids&quot; films, and are par for the<br /><br />course for the late 90's &quot;There's Something About The Dumber Kingpin<br /><br />Who Shagged Me&quot; genre pieces.  And looking back to my high school and<br /><br />college years, it occurs to me that, hey, it was *exactly* like that,<br /><br />drunken fumbling, body fluid mishaps and all.
