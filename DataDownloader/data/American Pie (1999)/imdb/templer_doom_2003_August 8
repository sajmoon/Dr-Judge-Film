Although the film has moments of grossout humour, AMERICAN PIE is actually
quite a cute film with a warmth that some films of it's ilk has. Wisely
focusing as well on the problems that some teenage boys face, and girls to
that extent, it is a lot more enjoyable for that.<br /><br />Both Tara Reid and Mena Suvari manage to maintain a sense of dignity with
their roles and don't allow themselves to be fazed too much by some of the
more ridiculous moments on show.<br /><br />Sean William Scott does have a touch of the Jim Carreys about him, but he
will be fondly remembered as Stifler. Eddie Kaye Thomas nearly steals the
film with his portrayal of Finch with his laid-back manner.<br /><br />Good fun.
