This is the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time.  A few people
compared it to Porky's, but I think it was better.  I was a teenager when
Porky's was out.  Whereas Porky's had a number of funny scenes, American Pie
was 90% funny.  Also, some of Porky's jokes were mean spirited.  It was
refreshing to see a funny film that thrived on the funny side of the human
experience instead of making jokes at someone's expense. I saw the uncut
version on pay per view so I can't diss movie go-ers for their reviews.  But
if you get a chance to see the uncut version, do it!  While it's not
appropriate for young children (&amp;16), I think most young and young minded
adults will find it hilarious.
