The only reason this movie does'nt get a 10 from me is because I found the
first 30 minutes of the movie to be your ordinary teen
flick.<br /><br />But boy, once it kicks in, does the laugh out loud hilarity come at a quick
pace!<br /><br />I have'nt laughed out loud at a movie so many times in a long
time!<br /><br />I'm not kidding folks, this movie really did make me laugh till my sides
hurt. If you can overcome the first 30 minutes where it's just an ordinary
teen flick, then it kicks in and becomes one of the most hiliarous movies
I've EVER seen!<br /><br />
