2005_March 5 
As a huge fan of teen-comedy type flicks it's no surprise that i highly
rate this movie.The plot is that of one which a 16 year old can highly
identify with.Why? Simply because this film quite accurately depicts
the life and behaviors of (perhaps ALL) teenagers.<br /><br />I recently read a comment made about this film (a negative one) and i
found myself developing the image of an insecure 35 year old who had no
fun at high school, irregardless of this, how can someone be watching
&quot;American Pie&quot; for the first time in 2002...American Pie 2 was already
released then...Behind the times, yes, perhaps.<br /><br />Overall to come onto IMDb and write a review of what IS a &quot;CLASSIC&quot; and
the &quot;STANDARD&quot; for any teen movie to this date is just quite funny
actually, i have met many types of people with all kinds of
personalities and not heard one thing wrong or negative about this
film.I do not believe in comparing one teen movie to another because
each are their own films, with their own plots/sub-plots, one liners
etc etc.But in order to accurately draw up some sort of conclusion
and/or list of titles in order of the better, then this must be done
AND as much as i love the &quot;PIE&quot; Series of films i have many other
favorites that in my opinion don't add up to feel as fresh and funny as
the &quot;PIE's&quot; but FUNNY they very much are.<br /><br />If you watch this movie and feel totally
disgusted/disappointed/bored/sick/revolted/annoyed even, well think of
this, MAYBE it's something to do with YOU and your personality,
remember this IS entertainment, NOT REAL LIFE! If it were it would be
totally boring.<br /><br />A lot of people (Peeete from UK for one) say the creators were being
dishonest etc about the story and it's world far from reality!? What
did you do with your friends at school? i agree there is a lack of real
behaviors i.e bullying etc but if you take time to hear what the
film-makers have to say you will realize you are out of your own depth,
Adam Herz clearly states in the &quot;making of...&quot; that his school-life and
friends had an &quot;OMAGE&quot; feel to it....The point i am making is MY SCHOOL
felt like this....Yes some people hate each other BUT it's cast away in
the shadows when you bring to light the &quot;togetherness&quot; feel everyone
has.American Pie : Stifler is the (somewhat more verbal less physical)
bully.It's all there for your &quot;real world&quot; eyes to see but when you
directly compare this Flick to your actual life then YOU ARE OF COURSE
GOING TO BE Disappointed! Comdeies are made for laughs, i laughed, a
lot, therefore this is a pretty damn good comedy, i just wish that in
the real-world where we all live more people could just let themselves
go when watching a film of this genre, instead of getting all worked up
over a movie about a dude who screws a pie :) ********* out of
**********<br /><br />9 out of 10 because life just isn't perfect!
