This movie is sexy and provocative, especially for Shannon Elizabeth
getting on to Jason Biggs. Although sexuality and nudity are okay, but
I do not think foul language is a good idea because what I saw the
South Park movie is that those South Park kids should not see this foul
language Terrence and Phillip movie. The reason I assure you that foul
language is wrongfully uncalled which is my suggestion not to have that
in other American Pie movies. Parents should not use foul language on
their kids because it is wrongfully uncalled. I think foul language
should be forbidden in future American Pie movies because as what
Sheila Blofowsky would say &#x22;Because it is evil!&#x22;
