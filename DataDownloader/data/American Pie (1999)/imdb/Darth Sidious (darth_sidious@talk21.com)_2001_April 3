I thought this was going to a good teen film, but I was wrong. The Breakfast
Club is STILL the best in the teen/brat pack genre, American Pie isn't
special, it isn't unique at all.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that it centres on the sex too much, yet never
goes in any depth with characters. There was a lack of seriousness. It
doesn't try to give something to the audience, I think director was more
interested in shocking the audience (It failed).<br /><br />I'll give some credit, there are some amusing moments, especially when one
kid gets ahold of the pie, nuff said!<br /><br />The writing was boring, it featured characters you seen
before.
The direction was aimed at teens who think they are hip, how
pathetic!<br /><br />Don't bother with this trash, The Breakfast Club is still the
best!
