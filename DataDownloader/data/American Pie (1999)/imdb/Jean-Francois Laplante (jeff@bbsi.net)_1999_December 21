This is a great movie.  I saw the unrated version on video and it was great
with no scene compromise to get a specific rating.  Keep in mind those are
young people and this may me shocking for some parents to imagine what's
going on in their kids head at that age!  Many actors were unknown but
since
they were kids playing kids the ensemble was very natural.<br /><br />The pie scene is unforgettable.  There was a toilet scene &quot;a la&quot; dumb and
dumber wich is always hillarious because most of us can relate on some way
or another!<br /><br />The movie is very easy to watch and you're guaranteed to get a laugh every
3-5 minutes.
