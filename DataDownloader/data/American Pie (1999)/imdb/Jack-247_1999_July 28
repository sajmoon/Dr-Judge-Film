I though this film was funnier then Something About Mary. The actors and
actresses involved are either going to be big or they are already legends in
their own right i.e. Eugene Levy.<br /><br />This is a must see film. It is a low budget film that had a great script.
Sure it is raunchy at its finest but thats why it is so
great.
