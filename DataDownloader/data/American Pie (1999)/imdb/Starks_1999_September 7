1999_September 7 

I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I
saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's
Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film
(Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is
hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out
comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of
likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br /><br />I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal
in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his
image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be
Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting
muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action
film).<br /><br />Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the
guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to
follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for
Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.
