American Pie is one of the most successful teenage-film about four last
class students trying to get laid before the school ends. What makes this
movie very funny and popular is all the situations where the characters
are
confused.For example the situation of &quot;Extra light beer&quot;. American Pie is
the &quot;father&quot; of the newer films, such as &quot;Road Trip&quot;, &quot;100 Girls&quot;, and
others. If you are a teenager, this is a must-see film for you!Don't miss
it! P.S. I hope American Pie 2 will be as good as the first one, because
the
first one had been the number one here in Lithuania for longer than 2
months!
