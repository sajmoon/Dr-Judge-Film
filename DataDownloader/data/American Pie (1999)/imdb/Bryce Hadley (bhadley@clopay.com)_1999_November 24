1999_November 24 

I'm surprised to see that females rated this movie higher than males.
For
any man who's not ashamed of his teenage years this has got to be one of
the funniest movies ever.  Because it fits my generation a little better,
I
think its an even better high school comedy than &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont
High&quot;!
