1999_July 17 

I felt this film was going to mine the same idiotic and dated material which
Porky's covered nearly twenty years ago but I was pleasantly surprised it
didn't. What I found was a humorous and  adolescent romp through the trials
which four males on the cusp of manhood have to travail. While many critics
have unjustly compared American Pie's gross out factor to last year's
There's Something About Mary, a film which rests squarely in the surreal and
twisted category, Pie makes a good and solid argument that the fumblings of
sexual awareness among teens is at once hideously awkward (parents
discovering their son's masturbatory predilections) and uniquely mature (a
girl realizing her suitor may not be what he seems). Some may carp that the
ending satisfies all concerned just to tie up some loose ends but I think it
really is a case of 'to the victors go the spoils.' Not everyone wins, not
everyone loses, but hopefully everyone learned.
