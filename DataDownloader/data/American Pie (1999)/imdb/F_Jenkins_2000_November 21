Am I the only one who didn't like this film? Everyone, including people
whose opinions I respect said it was funny. Well, if you're a big fan of
Porkys or other lame teen comedies of the early 80s, maybe.  Outside of the
great Eugene Levy, there was nothing entertaining about this movie. It
wasn't funny and the fact they're making a sequel is disturbing.  It's bad
enough that good movies have to have sequels, but bad ones
too?
