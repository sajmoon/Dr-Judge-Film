American Pie is a very funny movie, but not completely successful. The
characters are uninteresting, mainly do to all-too-typical dialogue, and
lazy, all-too-familiar story development. Still, it has big laughs and is
the second best out of the late-'90s teen comedies (second behind 10 Things
I hate About You) **1/2 (out of four)
