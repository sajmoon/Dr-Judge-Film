1999_July 6 

Gross comedies, some work (THERE SOMETHING ABOUT MARY &amp;
BASEketBALL), others don't work too well (AUSTIN POWERS 2 &amp; SOUTH PARK:
BIGGER, LONGER, &amp; UNCUT).  AMERICAN PIE is different, it's not a movie like
AUSTIN or SOUTH that relies on
it's gross humor to save the muddle script.  No, instead the gross humor is
a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very
well!
The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein,
Thomas Ian Nicholas, &amp; Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make
a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time
they
graduate.  The idel time to &quot;score&quot; is on prom night, so all four guys are
working and preparing for prom night.  Oz (Chris
Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member,
Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy.
Kevin
(Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his
current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex.
Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to
impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then
there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and
has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon
Elizabeth).
From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six
Flags
rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out
jokes.  How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides?  AUSTIN
POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary &quot;kiddie&quot;
rollercoasters.   BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the
rollercoasters,
like a medium thrill.  ANALYZE THIS and AMERICAN
PIE are the monster coasters of laughs.  The ones that
people
wait 3 hours in line, freak out while on the ride, and want more!  Well,
that is what you get after seeing AMERICAN PIE,
you want more!
These young actors are all going to be famous, the
same
way AMERICAN GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES, &amp; DAZED &amp; CONFUSED made
most
of thier stars big.  I'm sure 15 years from now, their will be a
collector's
edition similar to GRAFFITTI and FAST TIMES.  This
is the FAST TIMES for the 90's teens, but it also appeals to
the
20 something crowd, like me.  I really did enjoy seeing Chris Klein play
the
same type of person he played in ELECTION.  Jason
Biggs was very funny as the unfortunate Jim, who is unlucky most of the
time.  Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are both very good
as the girls who are wondering if they are making the right decision.  But
the two I thought stand-out are Shannon Elizabeth
and Eddie Kaye Thomas.  Elizabeth is GORGEOUS, she will get tons of iternet
hits by the end of the summer.  And Thomas is both very smooth and calm,
he's very similar to a calm David Schwimmer.
People are calling this the PORKYS of the summer.  It
isn't
PORKYS was very silly, immature, and cruel.  The guys were sex-hungry
idiots, and the girls were brainless sex objects.  I would rank this film
with the better comedy of 1982, FAST TIMES
AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  Like FAST TIMES, it's full of laughs, and it has
heart.  PORKYS didn't have any heart, just cruel jokes.
AMERICAN PIE will tickle the young adults funny bones the
same
way ANALYZE THIS tickled the adults and seniors funny bones.
But this film isn't for those only under 30, I'm sure that
older
people will enjoy this film the same way they enjoyed THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MARY.  Will the pre-teens will try to sneek into
SOUTH PARK or go watch AUSTIN POWERS 2.  The real men and
women
will be watching AMERICAN PIE, and lovin' it.  Just like I
did.
***** (out of *****)
