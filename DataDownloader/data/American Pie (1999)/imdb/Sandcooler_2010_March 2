2010_March 2 
This movie revived the whole raunchy comedy genre, but really it isn&#x27;t
all about bodily fluids. Its many knock-offs never seemed to get this,
but the sex jokes weren&#x27;t the core of this movie. Sure, it&#x27;s funny when
some dude gets caught getting it on with a pie, but that wasn&#x27;t really
the point. The way I see it, it was really about a bunch of guys trying
to cope with growing up. Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy master in awkward
situations, but their scenes are also incredibly heart-warming,
especially the one with the nudie magazines. My absolute favourite part
though (apart from the inevitable Nadia scene) comes near the ending,
when Jim finally manages to put everything into perspective and tells
everyone of. Such a brilliant scene, or maybe I&#x27;m just getting soft.
This movie has been called the &#x22;Porky&#x27;s&#x22; of its generation, and really
I couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself.
