1999_July 6 
<br /><br />Here it comes: The gross out movie of the summer of '99. You'll laugh
yourself silly, but you'll feel a little guilty thinking that you laughed
at
such infantile adolescent jokes. In &quot;American Pie&quot;, Paul Weitz
has
directed  a group of likeable young actors portraying  seniors in high
school. They are in pursuit of the
&quot;Holy Grail&quot;, losing their virginity by the night of the Senior Prom. Yes,
that's it. You can predict the rest
of it after the first five minutes. The masturbation jokes are there.
You'll
laugh at them. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The embarrassing
teenage pranks involving sex and bodily functions are as
ridiculous as ever, just a little more over the line than you've seen
before. But pushing the envelope in these
types of comedies is what it's all about.  So check your brains at the
door
and have a good laugh.
