Yes, it's a teen gross-out comedy- but it's actually quite a good one,
at that! American Pie follows a simple plot- a group of male teenagers
make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation from high school,
in any way possible. And let's where all the fun starts!<br /><br />I thought this could have easily been a heartless, purely gross-laughs
teen comedy, but it wasn't. The actors give the story life-
particularly Jason Biggs, who plays the lead of Jim. He makes nerdish &amp;
nervous teen guys seem pretty nice :)<br /><br />Sean William Scott showed his comedic worth in this movie...he steals
the screen with his portrayal of Stifler.<br /><br />Definitely has some gross moments- who could forget that 'toilet'
scene?<br /><br />Good value for money. And Eugene Levy is a comedic STAR, as Jim's
embarrassingly helpful dad.<br /><br />7/10
