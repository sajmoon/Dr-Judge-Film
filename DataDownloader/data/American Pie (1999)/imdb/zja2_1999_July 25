This movie was exactly what i expected it to be...raunchy and absolutely
hilarious!  If you go to this movie expecting much else, you'll be
disappointed.  Not every high school senior thinks about sex that much, but
many do.  The people who made the movie said they wanted it to be realistic,
and i will tell you that that is how many high schoolers talk and act.  Not
all, but many.  So go see it!  It is raunchy, funny and actually has a good
moral under tone.  And if your date has a sense of humor, it's an awesome
date movie!
