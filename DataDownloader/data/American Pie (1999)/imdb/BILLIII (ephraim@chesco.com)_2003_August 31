Picture realistically depicts the wrestling match most adolescents
involve
themselves in with sexual relations. Movie was well done
technically
and the actors were pretty believable; but the subject is one
of
growth from immaturity, and the rating reflects this genre. Light weight,
but how else could it have been done, given its goal?<br /><br />Bill Schaefer
