This movie reminds us all how truly awkward sex can be. Especially the
first
time. But my grandfather told me not to worry, it gets better with age.<br /><br />And in the end, this isn't really about four guys losing their virginity.
It
is about growing up. And it makes a great date movie.<br /><br />
