1999_August 6 

This film is rude and crude, but reminded me of my teenage years....  it
brought back memories of those awkward pubescent moments and trials of
peer
acceptance...  it was as fun as Something about Mary, but I wouldn't rate
it
better or worse..  perhaps it wasn't a cinematic masterpiece, but it was
really fun and I would recommend it to anyone not easily
offended.
