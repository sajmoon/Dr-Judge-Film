<br /><br />This movie was pretty damn funny. I had heard almost everything about it
prior to watching it: it was hilarious, raunchy, disgusting, stupid, etc.
While some of the jokes were really of the gross kind, it wasn't as bad as I
expected.<br /><br />In the end, I had my laughs and surprisingly more depth than one expects
from teen comedies. <br /><br />The performances were okay all around (even though Jason Biggs' character
was so dorky at times it became annoying), special props going to Sean Scott
as STIFLER, probably the best thing about this whole movie.<br /><br />
