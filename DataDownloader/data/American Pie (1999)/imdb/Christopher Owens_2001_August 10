You'd need to be between the ages 12 to 16 to find this film
funny.<br /><br />I'm 15 and how many times did I laugh?<br /><br />None.Nada.Zip.<br /><br />Some of the acting is excrutiatingly bad and the ''pie'' scene was just
disgusting.<br /><br />It was as funny as a sledgehammer to the face and than a chainsaw through
the back of your head.<br /><br />Tara Reid was the only good person in it.
