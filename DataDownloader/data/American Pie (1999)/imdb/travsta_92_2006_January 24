I saw this movie 3 years ago because I was only 7 when this movie had
been released. This is an amazingly funny and amusing sex comedy that
will have your eyes glued to the TV set. The other good thing is that
it has no limits to it's jokes like other movies where you need to be
careful of how crude the jokes are. <br /><br />The storyline is great with four teen-aged boys make a pact to loose
their virginity by Prom night as they fail to do so and it sends a
message across to the audience.<br /><br />Steve Stiffler is very different to the second and the third and as I
was watching the First film for the first time in a long while
Stifler's swearing seemed a little forced. Such as at the beginning,
&quot;Nova!!&quot; &quot;What's up dude?&quot; &quot;You coming to the Party tonight Ozzie you
*beep* face?&quot; seemed a little forced.<br /><br />A hilarious and amusing sex comedy with a great storyline is always
something special.
