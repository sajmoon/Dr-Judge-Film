By &quot;American&quot;, of course, I mean your attitude towards sex and sexuality is
more tightly wound up than that of Fred Nile or Pat Robertson. It would be
much easier to relate to this film under those circumstances than say, if
you and your girlfriend were having threesomes with her best friend once a
month by the time you were seventeen. It's a little harder to sympathise
with the characters of this film if you happen to fit that
profile.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film, of course, is the characters. In spite of them
being pulled from something Pat Robertson might have read as a boy, they are
genuinely sympathetic and easy to relate to. The dialogue during the prom
lifts this film out from under the weight of gutter humour and gives it some
kind of moral. There was definitely a sense of closure to the end of the
film, rather than the usual disbelief that marred the sex comedies of the
eighties. I guess this comes from the fact that the characters seemed to
have genuinely matured and changed as a result of their experiences, rather
than remained idiots.<br /><br />All in all, a genuinely enjoyable film with well-written, genuinely likeable
characters who, in spite for their Americanisation, have shades in them that
everyone can recognise. Now all we need is a film that combines the premise
of this film with a more Fight Club sort of mentality. Maybe I should get
around to writing that autobiography...
