1999_July 26 

I absolutely love this movie.  With the last couple of movie seasons having
been bombarded with some of the cheesiest we're-cute-teenagers-graduating-and-getting-ready-to-face-the-world
flicks in years, I was psyched to finally see a movie that was hilarious,
somewhat heartfelt, and didn't make me gag.  Most high school movies have
found it necessary to deal with the anxiety teens face when preparing to go
to college, and have forgotten about their more basic concerns.  As people
get older, they forget about what it was like to fear virginity and getting
laid at the same time.  It was nice to be taken back to such confusing times
for a chance to laugh at myself.<br /><br />One tiny editing mistake... when Finch enters the pool room and finds
Stifler's mom, he actually pulls the door towards him and walks in.
However, when Stifler breaks in on them and faints the following morning, he
pushes the door in (thus knocking over the chair holding the door shut).
Just thought other anal people might be interested in that little fact.
