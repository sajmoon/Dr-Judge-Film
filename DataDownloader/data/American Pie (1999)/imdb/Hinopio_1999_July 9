1999_July 9 

I am one of the members of the target audiences for this movie, a horny
teenaged male, but I didn't think this movie was all that great.  It is
advertised as a comedy, which it is, there are some funny parts, but they
threw in a lot of sentimental stuff and slow parts in here.  Like
Something
About Mary, I thought this movie was way overrated.  A few attempts at
gross-out humor and some phallus jokes do not a good movie make.  South
Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut, which was released just a week before this,
was
a lot funnier, raunchier, and more fun to watch.  The funny parts do not
make up for the slow boring parts.  The movie tries to make you laugh one
second and then feel for the characters the next, but for me it didn't
work.
Good scenes:  The beginning scene, the pie scene, any scene with Jim and
his father, the Jim and Michelle sex scene, the Fitch and the one guy's
mother scene (MILF-Mother I'd Like to F**k), and the scene with Jim and
Nadia.  Bad scenes: just about everything else.  The slow moving parts
that
try and give the characters feelings and stuff, which doesn't belong in a
teen sex comedy.  So if you have a choice between this and South Park, if
I
was you I'd go with South Park.  Or, if you still want to see a good sex
comedy, go out and rent Porky's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or National
Lampoon's Animal House.
