1999_May 10 

It appears to be one of those movies that you have to be in the &quot;right
mood&quot;
to appreciate.  There were some moments where you just wanted the scene to
be over, as it was dragging on, but there were numerous funny moments to
make up for it.  While there were a couple of &quot;gross-out&quot; scenes, they
were
not any worse than those in, for example, &quot;Something About Mary&quot;.
Definitely worth watching....
