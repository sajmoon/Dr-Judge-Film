&quot;American Pie&quot; is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film. I saw &quot;South
Park&quot;
the same day, and &quot;American Pie&quot; totally blew it away. The first scene is
can't miss, so don't get to the theater late. On the outside, this film
appears to be a buncha horny teens vowing to get laid by prom night. It
looks like a totally distasteful movie. But you know, this movie is very
tasteful. It's better than &quot;warm apple pie&quot;, as they said in the movie.
Sure, it has it's gross scenes, but you know, it's all done in relatively
good taste. Despite the appearance that the message is for teens to have
sex
as soon as possible, it's not. There is a message which lies beneath. Sex
is
not the most important thing in high school, but it sure seems that way.
There is a nice message, which plays in near the end of the movie. If you
like to laugh, and can take a couple of gross-out scenes, then take a look
at &quot;American Pie&quot;, the best film of the year.
