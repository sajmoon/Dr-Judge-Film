I had dissed this movie ever since I saw previews for it. It looked like a
dumb movie to me for some reason. I finally saw it on TV like last month or
2 months ago. Then I rented it last month, (LOL) and loved it more than when
I saw it on TV. I was laughing my a** off the entire time!<br /><br />I really liked the scenes with Jim and his dad and their conversations and
how embarasing it is to talk about sex with your father like
that...
I also enjoyed the sequel!...
