2000_January 12 

I expected little of this film and I got it.  I saw it at a friend's house
when everyone else decided to watch this movie, and it was like being
trapped in a frat house for 2 hours (not a good thing.)  And did anyone in
this film actually do any homework (besides the &quot;tutoring episode)?  I'm 23,
young enough to remember high school, and I don't remember having this much
time to worry about &quot;getting some.&quot;  Darn extracurriculars.<br /><br />I will admit that the dancing kid at the end did sort of crack me up, but
otherwise this film really was a piece of dreck.  Maybe if I were younger
I'd like it.
