American Pie is one of those films that you can watch from start to
finish, without feeling bored or wanting to fast forward it. From the
start of the film where you see the main character bumbling dork Jim,
try hopelessly to get the girl he likes to notice him, to the finish in
which Finch gets the girl nobody in there right mind would expect, the
whole film is one gigantic chuckle-fest.<br /><br />Laugh it up as you follow the four guys, Jim, Kevin, Finch and Oz, and
feel pity and amusement as they make a pack to loose there virginity
before prom.<br /><br />One of the highlights of this film is the hysterical Stifler. Most of
his sentences include swearing, and he thinks hes god gift. But not
everything turns out the way he plans. And thats all I&#39;m saying about
him ;) Anyway if you like rude jokes, stupid situations and teenage
comedies as a whole, then check this film out! The king of all teen
comedies, with a marvellous second and third film as well! ****/*****
