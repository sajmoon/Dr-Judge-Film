1999_July 22 

This movie was outstanding!!  Rarely does a comedy provide consistent
laughter from beginning to end, but American Pie really delivers.  This is
the best comedy film of the past two years.  One of the most amazing things
is that Eugene Levy is the only known Actor in the entire cast.  Very good
chemistry between the main characters.  This movie is a must see for the
internet movie cam scene alone!!
