What can I say? You first expect the film to be just a bunch of guys
talking
about birds and failing miserably and then you actually watch it. What you
get is a brilliant comedy with some superb comedy moments and a hilarious
beer and semen scene. Well worth a watch although more of a lads film than
one for the girls.
