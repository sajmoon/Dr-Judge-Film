This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It goes into the
same
category as &quot;Monster in the Closet&quot; and &quot;Jaws:The Revenge&quot;. All of my
friends found it really funny and invited me around to watch it. I didnt
even smirk once and found it incredibly boring.<br /><br />If anyone bought for me American Pie 2, then the video would go straight
in
the blender. Just a terrible film, avoid at all costs!!.<br /><br />Rating, 1/10
I'm in a generous mood.
