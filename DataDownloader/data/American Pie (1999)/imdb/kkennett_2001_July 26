After seeing the promos targeting the lowest common denominator (&quot;just
like
warm apple pie&quot; - gee I wonder what happens), I decided to avoid this
movie
like the plague.  I figured you had to be under 17 in order to stomach the
movie.  I finally rented it because I was bored the other week and felt
like
watching some cheesy movies.  I was expecting it to be this generation's
&quot;Porky's&quot;, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie.  All the
lines
and attempts the guys use to pick up girls are so cheesy, but you can see
how a high school guy could actually try to use some of the lines/methods
(... I said *some*).  You don't have to be in high school to enjoy this
movie (although it wouldn't hurt).  You also shouldn't be expecting
anything
too deep.  This is just a comedy about some high school guys trying to get
lucky.  If you liked &quot;Ferris Beuller's Day Off&quot;, you'll like this.
Although
it's a better movie since it doesn't have all the situations that would
never happen like F.B.D.O. does.<br /><br />The movies I watched in high school were all basically just made to show
tits.  This actually relies on humor instead of nudity (although there is
some nudity).  If you're looking for a good comedy, and not offended but
the
the subject of sex, watch this one.  10 out of 10
