1999_July 6 

Now you might look at the score I gave this movie and think, &quot;This guy's
on
crack&quot;.  However, let me explain myself.  I rate movies on what I expect
them to deliver and how they match up to those expectations.  I expected
this to be a teen-flick about sex that would be humorous at times, but
nothing extraordinary.  I was so wrong.<br /><br />This movie was so much better than any teen comedy I have ever seen - and
easily in my top ten comedies of all time behind Clerks, Caddyshack, etc.
The entire theater was laughing hysterically through at least 50% of the
movie.  The characters were believable - you know at least one person
exactly like each of these characters.  They have the high school male sex
drive pegged (along with the guy talk).  Eugene Levy could have been any
of
our dads - trying so hard to talk to his son candidly about sex, but
failing
miserably.<br /><br />Take my word for it.  This movie is ten times better than &quot;There's
Something
About Mary&quot;.  My only regret is that I saw the Sneak Preview and have to
wait a whole week before I can see it again.  I don't buy any movies on
videotape, but I already have a space in my cabinet reserved for this
one.<br /><br />
