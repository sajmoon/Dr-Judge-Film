teen movies suck , but this is a major improvment of stupid teen
movies.This
movie was so good it's my 2nd favorite movie of all time and i hate teen
movies , but this movie is not for the younger audiences neither are
american pie 2 or american wedding , but this movie is a must see and
stifler is the greatest character ever .
my review
4 1/2 /5
