In the tradition of such classics as Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont
High, American Pie shows a very honest and funny depiction of what is
really
going through the average high school senior's mind.  Unfortunately, this
movie has already been underrated by being compared to There's Something
about Mary, which, despite good box office performance, was very short on
laughs.  American Pie is the best good time comedy to hit the theaters in
years, and should not be missed.  Both men and women alike will be talking
about this movie for a long time.
