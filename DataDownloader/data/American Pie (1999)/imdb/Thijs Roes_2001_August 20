American Pie is one of my favorite movies every, that is why I am so amazed
when I read all the reviews here.
I first saw this movie about a year ago, and have seen it about 10 times
over again. The thing that spoke to me most was the excellent casting of
all
the actors and their interaction. They really looked like good friends who
grew up together, and whole picture of them working their way through the
end
of High School was so familiar to me. I felt with those guys, and could
image myself in the same spot.
Added to that is a healthy dose of good humour (in its genre), making it a
movie that amuses me over and over again.<br /><br />And please, do not say that you're grossed out by it, that's about the same
as saying that you went to see Nightmare on Elm Street and got scared. This
movie is MENT to gross people out, probably especially Americans, for whom
sex is still a big taboo. I wasn't grossed out by a masturbation scene, of
course not, the only thing one could see even were some boobs, and I've
seen
those before. The pie scene was, in my opinion, just funny because of its
oddness, and because of the great acting of Jason Biggs and Eugene
Levy.<br /><br />Yep, this is certainly one of my favorites, I can watch this thing over and
over again, and still be amused. A big 10/10.
