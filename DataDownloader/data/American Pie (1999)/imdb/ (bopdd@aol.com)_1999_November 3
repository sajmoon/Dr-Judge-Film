American Pie was a waste of ticket money, and I think I am more shocked by
the public's positive reaction to the movie than I am with the stupidity of
the film. A kid sticks his penis into a pie is basically the story line,
and
I am sure that is what Hollywood had in mind, that scene, and then they
built a dumb story around that. And not only did everyone see it, but
everyone liked it. Are people that pathetic, or they just haven't seen the
right movies? I was slightly amused by some scenes, but to be honest, the
guys were such dorks, I didn't want any of them to lose their virginity. I
wanted to beat them up because they were corny, corny like the people who
enjoyed American Pie.
