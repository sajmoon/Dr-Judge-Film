1999_September 17 

	This movie was one of the most funniest movies this summer! It included
realistic scenes where-as some movies try to create something realistic,
this movie actually does. This movie was about four high school teenagers
making a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom. The outcome is
pretty surprising too. The reason I say that this movie is so realistic is
because it completely relates to teenagers today. Same problems, same way of
thinking, etc.
 
	Some people say that the gross-out humor is what makes the movie bad, but
in my opinion, it's what makes the movie fun. The reason that it's so funny
is because it's gross-out humor. I know that this isn't &quot;gross-out&quot; humor
but, it's the only example that I give. I  remember that in one scene, they
were at a party and this one guy, Jim, walked up to the girl that he liked
and didn't know what to say so he just started to laugh with the girl and
her friends and then walked away. He didn't even know what they were
laughing at. Over-all, I think that this was a good TEENAGE movie.
