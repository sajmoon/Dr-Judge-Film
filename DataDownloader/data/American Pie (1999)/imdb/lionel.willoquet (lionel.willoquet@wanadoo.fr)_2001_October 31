In writing this bawdy comedy about four friends who will do anything to lose
their virginity before going to college, screenwriter Adam Herz set out to
overturn the conventions concerning films about adolescents. This is why the
script he submitted to the film production studios in 1998 was entitled &quot;A
sex comedy for teenagers which could be made for less than 10 million
dollars, which most readers are no doubt going to hate but which you will
adore&quot;. After many rejections, the script won some admirers at Universal
Studios. There, it was firmly believed in, but no one was going to take the
gamble of casting star names. The actors would be unknown, the director
likewise. Chris Weitz, one of the producers, convinced his brother Paul to
make his debut as a film director with this film, renamed &quot;American Pie&quot;.
Paul and Chris co-authored the script de &quot;Antz&quot;. Having a controversial
sense of humour, they knew that the film they were going to make would
create a few sparks. And that is what happened. First with the censor, who
banned the film for under non-accompanied 17 year olds, and then with the
public, who raced to the cinema, howled with laughter and made this small
summer film into one of the blockbusters of the year.
