1999_July 10 

With all of the teen/young adult crap movies that have come out in past
few
summers (for example, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer), I went
into
this movie expecting to be highly disappointed. However, after watching
American Pie in the Theather, my rib cage still aches from laughing as
though the theater had been pumped with nitrous oxide. Rest assured this
movie won't go to far into changing your view on the world, but its what
modern comedy is all about, good old raunchy American humor. It mocks a
stage in each person's life that is naturally awkward, the &quot;first time&quot;,
with such frankness and a handful of ridiculous comic anecdotes that you
can't help but scream along with the other howling patrons in theater.
Klein
is supposed to be another Keanu Reeves, but frankly in this one movie as
Oz
he's proven to be a better actor. And Jim's antics throughout the movie
could carry the movie if it had to.
