American Pie concerns itself with four likable virgin teenagers three weeks
before their graduation. Each fears leaving high school a virgin and so they
make a pact to help each other score before their graduation.<br /><br />There are some scenes in this movie that out-gross There's Something About
Mary and that's some feat but the overall tone is sweet. It's possibly the
best-natured teenage movie for a while. The four leads are convincing. Jason
Biggs as Jim gets possibly the most embarrasing role in recent years (he's
the guy with the pie on the poster) but he gets most of the laughs. Kevin is
the most experienced of the three. He has a full time girlfriend and their
relationship becomes the cornerstone of the film's drama. Both are unsure of
their relationship and how sex should fit in it. Finch is the shyest and
strangest characters. He borders on a nerd but he formulates a plan to make
him the most talked about boy in the girls locker room. The only
unconvincing element of the four guy's adventures was with &quot;Oz&quot;. His efforts
border on sentimentality and his playing of a character who wants to find
his sensitive side doesn't work.<br /><br />The supporting cast are used effectively. The girls are not just objects of
affection. They are fully developed characters in their own right. Possibly
the funniest lines come from Stifler. An experienced jock who enjoys teasing
the four. <br /><br />American Pie is hardly family fun. For me it's success shows that there are
a lot of under-age teenagers sneaking into theatres. It may be a gross-out
comedy but hey it's heart is in the right place.
