This movie tries to combine the raunch of Porky's and the (at least
somewhat) realistic, characters of Fast Times At Ridgemont High.<br /><br />I laughed out loud exactly twice. When Finch, in a moment of passion, moans
&quot;Oh, Spifler's mom.&quot; and, of course, the final &quot;This one time, when I was
at
band camp&quot; joke.<br /><br />The raunch just wasn't that funny to me. Mildly amusing, but not laugh out
loud funny.<br /><br />The makers did better when it came to the characters and story arcs for the
characters. I was generally interested in what was going to happen to
them.<br /><br />In the end, I think that this movie is better than Porky's but not as good
as Fast Times At Ridgemont High.
