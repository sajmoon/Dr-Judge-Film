Here Are Some Facts...<br /><br />American Pie is a 1999 teen comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and
Chris Weitz and written by Adam Herz. This was the first film directed
by the Weitz brothers. The movie is centred on four boys who make a
pact to lose their virginity by their high school graduation, and their
subsequent adventures. The title refers to a scene in the film in which
the lead character is caught having sex with a pie&#151;earlier he was told
that &quot;third base&quot; feels &quot;like warm apple pie&quot;. It was a box-office hit
and spawned two direct sequels: American Pie 2 in 2001, American
Wedding in 2003. Singer Don McLean was credited for allowing the name
of his hit song to be used as the title.<br /><br />This film ranked number 49 on Bravo&#39;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;, and ranked
number 32 on Entertainment Weekly&#39;s list of the 50 Best High School
Movies. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted American Pie the
6th greatest comedy film of all time.<br /><br />Since the conclusion of the American Pie trilogy, featuring the
courtship and marriage of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, the
American Pie name has gone on to be used as an entity similar to
National Lampoon. The American Pie entity has spawned three spin-off
films: American Pie Presents: Band Camp, which was a direct to video
release in 2005, and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile was released
on DVD in December 2006. The next film, American Pie Presents: Beta
House will be released in 2007.
