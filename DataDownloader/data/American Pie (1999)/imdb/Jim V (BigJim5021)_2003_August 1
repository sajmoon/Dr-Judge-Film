Anyone that calls this movie a classic should be shot.  Not once while
watching this movie did I ever laugh.  I may have cracked a smile here or
there, but I hardly consider a movie to be funny if all I'm doing is
smiling.  Hell, I enjoyed the second movie much more so than this garbage
(so much that I bought it... only to realize that I made a mistake, and
therefore gave it away).  This movie reminds me of Road Trip, in that
everyone gushes about how funny it is, and what a &quot;classic&quot; (a term thrown
around all too often) it is... yet I don't find it funny in the least.
The
cast, with the exceptions of Sean William Scott and Eugene Levy are 100%
worthless... especially Chris Kline.  Please, someone buy him some acting
lessons.  The sight gags in the movie suck... flat out.  Looky, it's
spooge... HAR HAR HAR.  Give me a break.  American Pie?  More like
American
Crap.<br /><br />1 star out of 10.
