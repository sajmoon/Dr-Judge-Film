1999_June 11 

I can't believe there's so much hype about this movie!It's very
juvenile,unintelligent,badly acted and unfunniest film for a long
time.Sure
you'll enjoy it if you're 12 and not very smart.
It's insulting to even mention &quot;American Pie&quot; in a same sentence with
&quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;,which really was utterly original and
genuinely funny with great performances from all the actors.This is a very
stupid teen movie which no one over 14 and anyone with brains should waste
their time on.
