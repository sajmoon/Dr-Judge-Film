As I am not an American teenager myself, I failed to grasp the sense of
the entire movie, I am afraid.<br /><br />Further, I feel somewhat uneasy that I have watched it at all.<br /><br />Hence I comment on this title: anyone over the age of 20, not American,
who is not likely to laugh about bad language and noises coming from
peoples&#39; body cavities, skip this one as I should have done myself.<br /><br />Why is it, that since Grease nobody could come up with a somewhat
intelligent take on high school students and their major issue (a.k.a
get a girl/boyfriend quick before the party/end of semester).<br /><br />The characters are uninteresting and unreal, the story is simply dumb.<br /><br />There is only hype around this film because there is a tendency to
cheer on vulgarity nowadays instead of admitting you simply feel
insulted and think it misplaced and ridiculous.
