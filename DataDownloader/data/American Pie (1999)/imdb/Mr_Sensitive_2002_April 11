This is probably one of the best  teen movies i have ever
seen.
This movie is (in my opinion) not just about the guys that tried to get 
laid,  Look deeper it's also about  friendship, be sensitve toword girls
that what I have learn from this movie, and a lot of other things.<br /><br />This movie is a REAL comedy ,no matter how much you watch this movie can
still make you laugh.
I recommend evey teenagerk should watch this movie .
One things that I not believe there is still some people who still gave 
this movie below 8 , how is that  possible.I Would like to know the
answer?
