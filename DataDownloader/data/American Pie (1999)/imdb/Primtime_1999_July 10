1999_July 10 

American Pie could be simply described as the &quot;There's Something About
Mary&quot;
of 1999. It uses many of the same jokes about certain bodily fluids,
flatulation, zit-faced losers and getting it on with an older woman.
Needless to say, this film fully deserves its R rating as it goes full out
in trying to get laughs and in its high sexual content.<br /><br />This film is funny, extremely funny at times, regardless of how it is
done.
By following the adventures of four graduating virgins, all trying to get
laid, most films would not have problems getting the laughs. The final
scenes of the film wrap it up nicely with some predictable and
unpredictable
happenings (Let's just say that I didn't expect to hear Mrs. Robinson in
this film). Beyond the masturbation, pastry-loving and nude magazine
scenes,
one almost feels that the filmmakers are trying to end it all up with a
Disney &quot;be good&quot; message, however, that is all taken away
(Thankfully).<br /><br />The acting in this film is sub-par, but really does nothing to diminish
the
story. I also didn't care for the Oz - innocent choir girl relationship.
How
a hardcore, lacrosse playing jock could turn so soft so quickly is
something
only the movies could do. It also seemed that the gossipy redhead
character
was totally unnecessary as she added nothing to the film. The script was
well
written and the director created exactly what goes on for teenage boys at
this time in their life. These facts combined with the abundance of comedy
help to give this film such a good mark. Can't wait for the college
sequel.<br /><br />Be prepared to be grossed out and laugh, because after all this is only a
popcorn movie.<br /><br />6/10 stars.
