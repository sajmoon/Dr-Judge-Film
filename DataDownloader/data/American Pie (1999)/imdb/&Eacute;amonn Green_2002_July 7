This is the best comedy ever! Kevin, Ostreicher, Finch and Jim make a
pact to lose their virginity on prom night. All does not go to plan at
the start and their obnoxious but laugh out loud hilarious friend
Stifler keeps making fun of and maybe hampering them. Jim is more
intelligent than he is given credit for and he gets less luck than most
fans would think he deserves, Finch is the eccentric one who thinks he
is the most intelligent, Ostreicher is a jock but feminine and Kevin is
the deadly serious friend of the group. There are so many funny parts
in this film you have to go and see it. Great combination of sex and
comedy. What sets this apart that it is a &quot;nicer&quot; comedy and if you see
the film you will know what I mean. 9 out of 10. I would have give it a
10 only they deleted the best scene of the film with Stifler&#39;s wee
brother coming out of the closet and Jim and Michelle are lying on the
bed.
