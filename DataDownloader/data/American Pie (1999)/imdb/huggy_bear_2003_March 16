A must see.  This has to be on of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Of
course, it is a carbon copy of Porky's, but nonetheless, it was still
hilarious.  It just mainly deals with teenage boys and their &quot;quest&quot; for
sex.  That is all it is, and all it was ever billed to be.  And it goes over
great.  I admit, I was not too excited about renting this, but now I am glad
that I did.  If you don't like raunchy stories about teenagers, and if you
didn't like Porky's or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, don't rent it. 
Otherwise, if you had half a life in high school, and remember the things
that you got in to, rent it and laugh your *ss off.
