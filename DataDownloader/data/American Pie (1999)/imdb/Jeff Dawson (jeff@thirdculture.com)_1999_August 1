Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Chris Klein (ELECTION).
Four high school guys agree to get laid on prom night, but find out it&Otilde;s a
lot harder than it seems.  Every single joke is about sex, and although
Eugene Levy&Otilde;s knitted black caterpillar eyebrows and facial contortions as
the concerned dad &Ntilde; using porn mags to teach his son about the birds and
bees &Ntilde; are always a hoot, the film&Otilde;s about-face tone shift from
chicken-choking to earnest and sensitive arrives too late.  Or maybe I&Otilde;m
just getting old.  Co-starring Playboy pinup Shannon Elizabeth as the exotic
Eastern European exchange student and Natasha Lyonne as the husky-voiced,
world-wise yenta-widda-heart.  And what late-90s 'teen sex movie is complete
without a &quot;Third Eye Blind&quot; tune?
