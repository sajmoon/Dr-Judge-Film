I did not like American Pie at all!  It is a very sick movie.  It tells
people especially teenagers one thing: to do it.  I think anyone who likes
this movie needs their heads examined.  What is wrong with this world?  No
wonder people are getting STDs and stuff.  I think movies need to show
people doing it ONLY IF THEY ARE MARRIED!
