This movie is really funny in some scenes (Jim's dad sex talks, Nadia,
Stifler etc.) and me and my friends really liked it when it first came out
in 10th grade, but now I see a lot of flaws in the portrayal, message, and
theme of this movie.<br /><br />This is really just an average white-suburbia, spoiled kid, focus-the-plot
on sex movie.  And being from white suburbia, I know this better than
anyone.  the lives of these teenagers is pretty much like stuf I saw in my
high school experience.  Kids worrying about how good they look every day,
how hot so and so looks today, or i cant wait for the party on saturday
attitude.  This movie succeeds at portraying the life of suburbia.  suburb
kids have it so easy, the only thing they have to worry about is having sex
and looking good.  Beleive me...I know!  The movie KIDS does a really good
job of showing the opposite...the dangerous and unsafe lives that city kids
go through today, a life much different than suburbia.
