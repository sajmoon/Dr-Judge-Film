One has to wonder why grown adults make films like this one and like the
film Kids, which depict young people in vulgar, crude and obscene ways. If
you protest the making of trash like American Pie-you are portrayed as some
sort of right-wing censorship mongering individual. This is not the case for
me. I enjoy films that show a healthy attitude toward sex and do not blush
at the sight of nudity on screen. What is sad is that perverse people as the
so-called creativity behind this tripe were able to put on screen some of
the likely sick imaginings of their youth. I will not see the sequel-I saw
enough of the first to know how poor of taste it will be. In a recent
interview with shock film maker John Waters-he told the interviewer that he
no longer made films to shock-because there were so many of them out there
from mainstream hollywood. Waters speaks truly. Don't waste your time with
this, there are far too many good films that have and will be made about
young people. When you pay to see stuff like this, it is the same as
rewarding the folks who write obscene sayings on bathroom stalls. I would
not be surprised if American Pie's producers were tops in this department
while in high school.<br /><br />Michael
