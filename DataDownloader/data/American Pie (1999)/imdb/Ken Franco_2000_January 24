Never before have I seen a comedy that fails so miserably as this movie.  At
least, I assumed it was a comedy, despite the fact that there was nothing
even remotely laughable in it.  Anything that may have had even a small
amount of humor was beaten to death by the commercials, so when it came up
in the movie, all I could do was groan.  For example, all the jokes
throughout the movie about the one kid's slut mom, and how everyone wanted
to nail her were wasted, because everyone already knew that
whateverhisnamewas would get her by the end of the movie, because it was in
the commercial.  Same goes for the infamous pie scene.  If you want to shock
people, don't show an edited, less interesting version of your shock scene
in all the trailers, or put it on all the posters.  Perhaps had I not
expected a pie to be molested, it would have been funny, but as it was, the
scene was dull, at best.  I've seen &quot;Batman and Robin,&quot; and &quot;Chairman of the
Board,&quot; yet this holds strong to the title of worst thing I've ever seen.  I
wish I could give it negative stars, it was just awful.
