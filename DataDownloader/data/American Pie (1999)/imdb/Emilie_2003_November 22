American Pie is about as american as american pie. the movie is perfect
at
showing exactly how obsessed teenagers are with sex and trying to get
some
pie.  jason biggs, and seann william scott are hilarious, and you all
know
that you wanted finch to get any at all, just because all the others were
getting laid left and right!  the movie is all full of crude and sexual
humor, however, that starts and ends the movie, but i must say that
without
that nasty language, how many teens would have seen this movie? the movie
wouldnt have been the same without it!  but yet the movie did focus on
teenage dating, which didnt involve sex on the first date, and the
couples
eventually hold out for the ones that they do care about or find
attractive... this is a teen classic!  (B+ B)
