1999_November 18 

Ho ho ho.  This is one of those films that makes you think &quot;Yes, it is good
to be alive, and yes, being 18 was DAMN fun.&quot;
A superb film by anyone's standards, marred only perhaps in its dubious
moral-soaked fables towards the end, this is definitely one to
watch.
The humour is toilet humour, sure, but its toilet humour dressed up in a
tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, whilst listening to some good jazz. <br /><br />Male or female, old or young, I recomend this film.  It has some classic
scenes (pie, anyone?) and some good gags.
Comparable, perhaps, to Something About Mary, but tenfold
funnier.
