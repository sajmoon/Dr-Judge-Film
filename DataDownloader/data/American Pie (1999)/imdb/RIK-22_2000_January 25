2000_January 25 

I'm almost 29 and will confess to being a massive fan of Bachelor Party and
Animal House.  Unfortunately these popular films, I believe, never got the
credit they deserved because they were immediately associated with hundreds
of other childish soft-sex clones.  Obviously John Hughes came along
upgrading the teen theme with some excellent comedy-dramas (Weird  Science,
Ferris, etc).<br /><br />There'd been a bit of gap in-between then and know and I was sceptical that
this film could add anything new.  Oh what the hell, I'll give this American
Pie a go.<br /><br />About 4 teens trying to get laid and the hilarious antics they get up it to,
culminating into some kind of growing up by the end, it was surprisingly
funny, actually really funny.  It was a nice way that an old idea was
brought up-to-date using the tools of the nineties.  The film didn't resort
to just shock and stupidity it actually had some charm and whit about
it.<br /><br />I'm sure this won't appeal to everyone, but even though I'm not a teenager I
found this very funny and highly enjoyable.  Probably the best comedy I've
seen for a long time.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />
