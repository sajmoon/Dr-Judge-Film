Good High School Sex Comedy with good all around production and very good
performances from the actors. Could have been a classic if it was more
original but alas,nothing here not done before really. But still,it's above
average production will catapult this movie into eternal CULT CLASSIC. Only
for fans of the genre and big fans of the lead actors.......Love the Trance
song &quot;The Calling&quot; featured here in this movie during the very funny
Internet Camera Sex sequences! Bravo!
