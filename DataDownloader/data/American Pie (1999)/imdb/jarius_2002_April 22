Maybe I am too old for this? (I am 26.) The sad fact is that the only
character that I found somewhat funny was the poor father trying to teach
his son about boys and girls.<br /><br />As always with teen movies, this is a predominately male affair with the
female gender degraded to a simple sex object. If you like juvenile humor
then this must be a masterpiece. Everybody else should (and probably you
already have) avoid this one.<br /><br />Predictable.
