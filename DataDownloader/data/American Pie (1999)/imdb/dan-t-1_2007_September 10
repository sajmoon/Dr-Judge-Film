When i think about films I&#39;ve watched and what i think are good ones
and bad ones i have to say this comes close to the top in good
films.This film has to be the first film which shows what teen life is
like. OK in some bits it is crude but this is aimed at a teen audience
so teens do not really care if something is crude because it is normal
in their lives. The characters and actors are alike in ways and the
directors really worked hard with them to get the audience a real
experience of teen life.Basically you have gotta group of teens who all
want to get laid on prom night. You basically watch them make these
plans and watch as they all go wrong. Sit back and enjoy but really
they should have stopped after American pie 3.
