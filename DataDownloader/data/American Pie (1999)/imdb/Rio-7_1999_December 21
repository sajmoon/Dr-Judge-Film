1999_December 21 

This movie is nothing like Porkys. For one, Porkys was good. I grew up with
it. Sexual humor is fine, I love movies that you can kick back with. But
THIS flick.... If I said what I really thought of it my comments would NEVER
be accepted.<br /><br />I would expect Thomas Ian to go for better movies than this, he's got some
good talent. Utterly wasted on this flick. zip out of 10.
