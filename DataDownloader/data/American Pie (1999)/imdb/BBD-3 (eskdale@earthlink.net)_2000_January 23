2000_January 23 

I expected this movie to be another Porky's or Animal House which I thought
low-brow comedy to be sure.  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. 
Not only was it funny but there was tremendous character development in it. 
The plot moved forward with a solid conclusion.  It looked to me like a
pretty accurate depiction of adolescent sexuality--its not all G rated, but
then adolescence wasn't either.  <br /><br />Mr. Biggs is certainly not afraid to do wild things and perhaps his scenes
are the most memorable in this movie--I chuckle just thinking about the
&quot;illegal channels&quot; scene, for who in their adolescence hasn't explored
auto-eroticism in fear of being discovered by his family?  His dancing scene
in front of the computer camera perhaps will go down in the annals of
comedy--at last something Lucy never did before!  Eugene Levy's sympathetic
and somewhat understanding, but at the same time bumbling father role, was
great.  My thinking was &quot;at least he's trying....&quot;<br /><br />Even though there were no real bad guys, it looks to me that Sherman and
Stifler got their just rewards in this movie too.
Probably something a lot of teens have wished for with regard to similar
characters in their high school experience, but were denied; for in my
experience those characters also seemed to get away with their insensitivity
to woman and untrue boasts far too often.  It was nice to see those types
put in their place in this movie.  <br /><br />If you want a good romp in the field of sex comedy, this movie is worth
watching.  I hope to see more of this cast in future comedies.  Since this
apparently is a first attempt by the Weitz brothers(?) I expect that we'll
see other great comedies from this writer/director duo.
