I thought this movie was going to be sick and perverted and stupid. 2 out
of 3 is right, it is sick and perverted, but it wasn't stupid, well it was,
but it was hilarious! Being a teenage, hormonal guy, i can relate to Jim,
Finch, Oz, and the other guy. They remind me of me and my friends. The
quiet
guy, the geek, the jock, and the nice guy.<br /><br />Basically this movie is about four guys, Jim Biggs, who needs to learn to
pleasure himself in the bathroom becuase he gets caught every flippin time,
Jim is quiet and doesn't exactly know what to say to girls, even if the
most
beautiful girl is naked in his own bedroom. Then there's Finch, classy,
high
society, and never sh*ts at school, always goes home, everyone calls him
Shitbreak. Then there's Oz, he's on the lacrosse? team, and needs to learn
how to be sensitive, then there's the other guy with the hot girlfriend,
who
is more experienced than any of the other three combined. After a party of
hopeless attempts to get some play, they decide to make a pact to get laid
on prom night.<br /><br />This is definetly one of the funniest movies i have seen in a while. My
favorite character was Michelle, the band girl. &quot;One time at band camp&quot; is
the beginning of her every sentence and &quot;it was so funny.&quot; is the end of
all
them. She was so hilarious. I give &quot;American Pie&quot; 10 stars!! Oh yeah,
Stifler's mom WAS a milf. heh heh heh.
