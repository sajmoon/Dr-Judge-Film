This movie had me in stitches all the way through. I went into the theater
expecting just another crappy teen movie, but it turned out to be
fantastic!! Too many classic scenes to mention. Just watch it and
enjoy!The
characters are so likeable and the situations and the outcomes are
hilarious. Well written and more realistic than a lot of the trash out
there. This movie is a must see. Classic!!!!!
