1999_July 8 

After all the hype surrounding this flick, I expected to laugh.  I didn't.
At a couple points, I smiled.  I thought the relationship between Jim and
his father was fairly well done.  But otherwise, this is just another
worthless teen comedy, kowtowing to the least discriminating of audiences.
Is it too much to ask for a comedy that makes me laugh?  There hasn't been
maybe of those in a the past few years.  Most of them are more obsessed
with
making penis jokes.  It makes me want to spit.
