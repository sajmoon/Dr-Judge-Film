Dreadful &quot;comedy&quot; that was (sadly) a huge hit. It&#39;s about a bunch of
idiot high school guys (all who are clearly in their 20s) trying to
have sex before they graduate. That&#39;s it. Seriously! That&#39;s the whole
plot! Now you COULD make an OK film out of this idea (maybe) but this
film doesn&#39;t even try. It just thinks up every single way a guy can be
sexually humiliated and/or appear pathetic and throws it at the
audience full force. Hey, why be subtle? Jason Biggs especially is made
to look like the most pathetic loser I&#39;ve ever seen. I suppose the
actor DOES deserve credit for humiliating himself again and again. He
has sex with a pie, drinks a drink with sperm in it, has premature
ejaculation TWICE (which his whole school sees), has his parents catch
him with a full erection, does a truly stupid dance to turn a girl on
which are his friends playing a joke on him...are you laughing
hysterically yet? If any of those above antics make you crack up you
might like this movie. Obviously many people did. I just found it
stupid, offensive, cruel and pathetic with a disturbing mean streak
running through it. The sole bright spot in this is Alyson Hannigan who
gives the ONE good performance.<br /><br />Mean, stupid and very unfunny. A 1 all the way.
