American Pie is an absolute hilarious film.  chris Klein, Jason Biggs, Eddie
kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all make a pact to lose their virginity
before graduation.  This is a very creative plot.  I have to say that the
best scene is Nadia's &quot;changing session&quot; and more.  It made me very VERY
happy.  All of the jokes are mainly sexually crude but very funny.   The
only odd thing about this is why nobody in a sexual situation ever locks the
door for a little privacy.  Tara Reid and Thomas Ian Nicholas never locked
there door when they decided to cramp his tongue.  Shannon Elizabeth didn't
lock her door when getting dressed.  Eddie Kaye Thomas and a mystery
character didn't lock their door.<br /><br />Overall I loved this movie and I was surprised at the outcome of this. 
Rating 10 out of 10.
