American Pie, which is trying to capitalize on the success of the Farrelly
Bros.'s There's Something About Mary, does an excellent job of living up
to
its predecessor.  American Pie tells a somewhat realistic, though very
exaggerated, story of four high school seniors who make a pact to lose
their
virginity by prom night.  The appeal of this movie, much like with 'Mary,'
is not the story, but the gross-out comedy.  And there is much of that in
this film.  Still, the story is not lacking, and this film does present a
sweet tale of friendship and the troubles of adolescence.  But the main
reason to see this is for the great laughs and shock value, as it has
plenty
of both.
