A hilarious caper from beginning to end! It echoes of past greats such as
Porky's but with far more sensitivity and youthfulness, more likened to
the
John Hughes classics of the last decade. Even at the senior prom, the band
are playing a cover of Simple Minds' Don't You Forget About Me, perhaps
paying homage to The Breakfast Club. Although these eighties trends are
relived, the film keeps up to date fairly well and to emphasise this, one
of
the gags involves the Internet!<br /><br />The plot is simple: four high school senior lads make a pact to lose their
virginity before they go off to college. They have, basically, until Prom
Night left, and they don't even have a date. Although the plot centres
around sex, it is more to do with dealing with adolescence than the
typical
over-confident characters in a lot of American teen-flicks which centre on
the college student. The film deals with sex as an issue of uncertainty to
both genders; a refreshing change for this new age of brat-pack
movie.<br /><br />With certain exceptions, the characters in American Pie are easy to
identify
with. They are almost likeable in their geeky ways, and their parents
almost
tolerable! The only thing that misses for me is that perhaps I am too old
to
fully appreciate it. I have a feeling that it was designed for people of
similar age to the characters within the movie for full impact. Being the
case, then, I would imagine many who see it are below the certificate
minimum.<br /><br />However it is a film for all to enjoy, although if you have a dislike for
toilet humour then avoid it. It relies on this as its backbone and the
theme
of masturbation is rife, albeit hilarious! Watch out for familiar faces
from
Buffy, most notably Alyson Hannigan. Perhaps not one to see with your
better
half, but your younger brother will adore it!
