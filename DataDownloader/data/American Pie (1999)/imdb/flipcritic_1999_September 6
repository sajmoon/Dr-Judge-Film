1999_September 6 

This film left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).  It has some great
comedic moments, and they are done very well, but most of them are
unoriginal.  I'd like to comment on them further, but I would be revealing
too much if I did.<br /><br />Despite what most people think, the movie does have a good message for teens
at the end.  But it doesn't make up for most of the despicable things that
were done during the rest of the film.<br /><br />This movie is very funny, but at what price?  Being tasteless.  Despite
getting a laugh out of this one, I wish I never saw it.
