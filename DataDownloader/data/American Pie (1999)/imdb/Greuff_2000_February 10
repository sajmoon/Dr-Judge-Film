This was one of the few movies where I got out of the cinema and still had
to laugh - this and &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;. I know, it's a matter of taste,
but this movie IS funny, when you don't look too sharp... and it has
certainly a deeper meaning, there are some beautiful real-love scenes in it.
Really good movie! btw. The first movie I rated 10/10
