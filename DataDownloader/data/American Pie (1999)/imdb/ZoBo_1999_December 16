1999_December 16 

I heard a lot of hype about this movie before I saw it.  About how these
people would be the new &quot;brat pack.&quot;  Nothing could be further from the
truth.  It was a boring, poorly acted, unfunny film.  I have nothing
against
&quot;gross&quot; comedy, in fact I love it when it's done well.  However, it was
used
so stupidly in this movie.  It was as if the writers said, &quot;okay, how far
can we go?  That'll be cool.  People will be shocked!&quot;  What's the point
of
shocking somebody if you have nothing interesting to say?  Sad movie.  The
one saving grace was the dad's performance.  Everything else was a total
mess.  The pie scene wasn't even funny!
