1999_July 25 

This was a great movie!!! I've never enjoyed a comedy like this in a long
time.  Also, I've never been in an audience were  everyone laughed so hard
and cheered so loud at many of the film's hilarious moments.  Now THIS is
what High School is really like.  Not like Dawson's Creek or Varsity Blues. 
I could relate to so much in this movie--not that i ever got down with a pie
or anything.  The two best characters in my opinion were the band girl
(Michele) and Jim's father.  A great movie you should go see right
now!!!
