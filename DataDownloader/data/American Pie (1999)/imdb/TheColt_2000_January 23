the 70's was American Grafitti/Animal House
the 80's was The Breakfast Club/Rat Pack flicks
The 90's was all about the AMERICAN PIE!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This movie is the quintessential teenage gross out flick that we needed.  I
cannot get enough of this movie:  Many teenagers have to deal with similar
pressures like this so it is a bit realistic at least.  It's a shame though
that is has to be R cause teenagers swear all the time and this movie is for
us teens so it kind of defies the point.  Of course, you don't have to be
any age to see the unrated version...
