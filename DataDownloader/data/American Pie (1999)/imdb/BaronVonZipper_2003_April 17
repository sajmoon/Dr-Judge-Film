It seems like this movie is funny as hell up until The Jock meets this
choir
girl. All of a sudden it just gets all mushy and turns into a chick
flick.
Put simply I'd say only watch the first half of this movie. It's like
your
dad taped Porky's and then your sister uses the second half of the tape
for
an episode of Dawson's Creek. Better yet get Porky's and forget this
one.
