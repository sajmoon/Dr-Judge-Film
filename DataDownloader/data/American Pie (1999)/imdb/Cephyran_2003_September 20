Certainly not the highest grade of comedy, but neither is it absolute
grossout humor. In the first installment of this trilogy we meet the kids,
this group of boys eager to lose their virginities by graduation. Now, while
a little shallow in story, the characters carry it well, especially Biggs
and Shannon Elizabeth together. Here we see a developed relationship of each
guy and his respective girl, and there certainly is sweet romantic stuff,
notably between Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. All in all, a defined guys
night rental.
