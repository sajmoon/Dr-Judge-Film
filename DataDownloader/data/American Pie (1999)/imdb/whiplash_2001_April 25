This movie has to be called a total blunder.
Although enjoyed by an inconceivably large amount of teenagers, American
Pie
has an immensely great lack of filmmaking and talent.
It combines wretched humor, a contemptuous plot, and superficial
characters
without common sense. What's the point?
American Pie is a rather embarrassing affair with its pathetic humor and
minimum 'comedic' tone. I find it hard to believe its huge boxoffice
success.
The movie, however, had one bright gleam; Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs as
father and son, whose performances were delightful.<br /><br />My conclusion is, after having suffered through the full duration, don't
EVER waste your precious time on this film. It's crap. The only reason I
ever saw it, was to be able to declare about it.
