1999_July 22 

Without a doubt, one of the funniest movies of 1999. I never laughed so hard
at a movie since...well since &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;. This movie
brought back memories of my days of high school romping. Every 5 years a
movie like this needs to come out so people can remember what high, school,
love, and sex was like when we were young. The acting was actually pretty
decent, and these unknown kids did a wonderful job portraying high school
teenagers looking for love. Would like to see a sequel with these guys in
college. That would be interesting. Go see this movie now, before it leaves
the theaters. Nuff said.<br /><br />Ace
