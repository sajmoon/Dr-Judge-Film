Fans of this movie keep saying that people who dislike American Pie are
easily offended snobs.  Trust me, sex violence and profanity are hardly
offensive to me, and I've seen far more graphic film (my favorite movie is
way more disgusting).  I am, however, offended by complete and unrelenting
stupidity.  You can't image how glad I am that I got to see this for free.
If I had payed, I would have never forgiven myself.  I didn't totally hate
it, as I am a fan of Alyson Hannigan, but I would sooner swallow glass than
recommend it to anyone other than despised enemies.  Oh yeah, I AM a
teenager(17), and if there are humans that actually act like this, thank
god
I am smart enough to avoid them entirely.
