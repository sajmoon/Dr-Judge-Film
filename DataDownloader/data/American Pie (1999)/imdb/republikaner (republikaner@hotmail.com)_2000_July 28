This so-called comedy is more embarrassing than it is fun. The constant
flow
of vulgar and sexual oriented &quot;fun&quot; is not enough to keep some one
entertained for the duration of the movie.<br /><br />The one or two times that you laugh is more to hide your shame than,
because
it is funny.<br /><br />The film seems to be a collection of random scenes only
loosely
connected by the plot. As far as I'm concerned this film must qualify on
the
top 10 over worst movie of the decade.
