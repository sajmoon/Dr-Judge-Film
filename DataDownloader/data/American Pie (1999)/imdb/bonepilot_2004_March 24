&quot;American Pie&quot; is a film made from a tired recipe of tasteless sex jokes,
cliches, and over-the-top attempts to shock, yet titillate the unsuspecting
viewer.<br /><br />Teen angst is at the center of this Michigan high school romp, which
describes the attempts of how four seniors  lose their virginity in a short
amount of time.<br /><br />I can plainly see more shortcomings than strengths from this movie
(reportedly directed and produced by first-timers Paul and Chris Weitz, and
written by the neophyte, Adam Werz).<br /><br />But, I admit that some of the time spent with these fictional characters
made me smile, even chortle to boot. The balance for all of the sexual
bufoonery comes in two forms: the attempt by the school &quot;jock&quot; to create a
meaningful relationship with a female choir singer, and the attempts by
Eugene Levy (as the father) to help his son ( played by Jason Biggs ) come
to grips with the youth's burgeoning sexuality...literally.<br /><br />In contrast to Sophia Coppola's &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, where the teenage
struggle for sexual self identity takes on a grim capacity, &quot;American Pie&quot;
is a constant barrage of locker-room innuendo, punctuated by zany stunts
performed by four believable boys who have anything BUT school on their
minds.<br /><br />Though not the funniest film I've seen in this genre, I have to hand it to
the Brothers Weitz and Adam Werz for turning out such a piece of pastry for
their first try.
