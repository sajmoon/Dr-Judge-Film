American Pie / ** 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Well, i'll start out with saying that it is one of the better movies of it's
genre. It has quite a few laughs throughout the movies running time, but for
some reason, watching it over all the way is kind of difficult.<br /><br />I was trying to watch this again the other day thinking back to how funny it
was the first time, but some of the scenes were boring and made me want to
skip around to my favorite parts. The acting however, was alright in the
movie. I was actually kind of impressed with how well the actors portrayed
their characters. Hannigan did an excellent job as Michelle Flaherty in this
movie, and hopefully she gets to be in a lot more movies in the
future.<br /><br />American Pie is about four teenagers who are on a mission to lose their
virginity by prom night. But each one has their own way of working their
plan out.<br /><br />My thoughts are that you can't watch this movie more than once or twice, and
I think the same will go for the sequel because some of the jokes get old
and aren't even funny the second go around.
