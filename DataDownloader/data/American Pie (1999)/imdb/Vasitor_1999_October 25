<br /><br />Even for a teenie bopper movie, this one stunk.  The gags were so lame, so
predictable as to make them utterly unentertaining. The previews
practically
tell you the entire movie.  Why the hell doesn't anyone in this film have a
lock on their door?  That's pretty convenient for pathetic, formulaic
comedy.
