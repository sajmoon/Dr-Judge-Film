It was a preview and it was free, so we went to see this movie that in
reviews was labeled &quot;Porky for the 90's&quot;. We were sitting at the ail, so
we
could make an easy escape. But soon we noticed we were laughing out loud.
We
even cried real tears laughing.
It is true that the jokes were mostly stupid and mostly about sex (after
all, it's all about a bunch of guys deciding to loose their virginity
before
graduating), it is also true that you could see them coming from miles
away.
But this was certainly not a movie about t+a-jokes. It was simply great
fun.
