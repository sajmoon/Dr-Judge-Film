As far as teen comedies go, this takes the genre to a whole new level.
It's
filled with crude scenarios and toilet humor, and succedes in producing a
generaly funny movie.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; focuses itself around the life and troubles of a bunch of
sexualy frustrated teenagers in high school.  Obviously they are all
virgins, which leads to the group making a pact, pledging to prove their
manhood on the senior prom night.  The majority of the movie is kind of an
anti-climax, so for the duration we see the guys making preperations and
attempting to get their dates.<br /><br />Funny, sick and plenty of eye candy.  This movie is one I will never grow
tired of.
