1999_December 21 

After seeing the previews and some of the downloadable clips on the net, I
was excited to see this movie. I think it's a tell it like it is sort of
story of teenagers today. Nothing seemed too raunchy as long as you
expected
it, so if you're easily offended I wouldn't recommend the movie, otherwise
it's an excellent show. It was one of my favorite comedies of the year.
