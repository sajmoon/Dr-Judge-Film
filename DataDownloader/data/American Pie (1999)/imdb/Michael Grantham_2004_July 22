2004_July 22 

I first saw this film when I was away from home staying alone in a hotel and
decided to go the cinema for something to do.  It was a 3 screen cinema and
when I got to the desk they asked me what I wanted to see and I had never
heard of any of the films.  I chose &quot;American Pie&quot; at random and sat down
with no idea what to expect - comedy, drama?<br /><br />Very quickly I was clutching my sides and laughing out loud.  I may be an
oldie (late 40's when I first saw it) and a number of other oldies clearly
didn't like it and have labelled it a teen comedy.  Well that is just what
it is, but hilarious nonetheless.  True it is a little crude in it's humour
but if you are reasonably broadminded you will enjoy it.  I just had to put
something in to correct the views of the other oldie stick in the muds. 
Some of us have retained a sense of humour!<br /><br />The now famous scene where Alyson Hannigan reprises her geek role from the
early Buffy series, but with a surprising twist, was pure magic, as was the
&quot;warm apple pie&quot; scene with Jason Biggs.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />
