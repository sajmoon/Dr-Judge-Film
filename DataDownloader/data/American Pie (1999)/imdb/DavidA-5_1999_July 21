1999_July 21 

I walked into the theatre hoping to see a movie in the genre of Fast Times
at Ridgemont High, or at least a film merely half as entertaining. I left
the theatre seeing a film that was just a silly farce in my opinion. I was
very disappointed, I just found this movie to be simplistic and an insult
to
the movie goers intelligence. The genuine laughs were far to few so I must
say a big thumbs down on this one.<br /><br />
