1999_July 6 

Well, I, like many of the other people who've commented on this flick, had
high expectations going in. I was let down, but not as much as some
people.
This film is funny. Much more than most other films I've seen this year
(but, I must say, that isn't saying much). And I'd also like to add, this
is, again IMO, better than most 'teen flicks'.<br /><br />Now, here's my take on the flick... Masturbation plays a big part in
here...
This isn't bad, and the scenes, IMO, worked for
comic effect without being too sick.<br /><br />The acting wasn't that bad, it could've been worse. A couple of the actors
worked for me: Alyson Hannigan (She's funny, what can I say?), Natasha
Lyonne (as always) and Chris Klein (of 'Election' Fame). Let me explain
the
last one... Chris Klein has played both of his characters he's had this
far,
well, vacant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that he's a bad actor (or
vacant for that matter)... I think it's intentional, that's why it
works.<br /><br />And, my take on the whole 'teen flick' bit... This is a teen flick, plain
and simple. However, I don't think this film is just for teen, adults can
appreciate the humor too. Though it is sad that they'll probably think
that
the vacantness of the characters is an overstatement. Unfortunately, it
isn't, it's more of an understatement.<br /><br />To conclude... all and all, this film is worth a look. Make that a look at
matinee prices (don't blow $10 or $12 on it).
