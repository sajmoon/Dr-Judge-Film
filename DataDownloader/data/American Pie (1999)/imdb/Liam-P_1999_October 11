1999_October 11 

Sometimes I laughed,  sometimes I cringed, sometimes I creaked in my chair
hoping for the film to pull itself out of &quot;Dawson's Creek
Mode&quot;<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is nothing more than a childish comedy with a supposed
morale-edge.  This morale-tone fades with every scene as the
perfect-skinned
girls and our troupe of heros eventually &quot;get it on&quot;.<br /><br />Far from being hopeless, &quot;AP&quot; trips itself up by being too lewd.  It
begins
to stutter and grind as the ending approaches and before long even the
enthusiastic members of the audience began to realise the film was running
out of steam.<br /><br />Not bad,  not good: but still worth it for *that* scene.
