American Pie is a masterpiece in teenage sex comedy and should be revered
as
a true throwback to the classic 80s comedies that you see every weekend on
USA, TBS and TNT.  Ten years from now, we will all be vegging out on our
couches watching this movie on cable T.V. just waiting for the Internet
scene, which in my opinion will be just as famous as Brad Hamilton
pleasuring himself in the bathroom in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and
Bluto
peeking in to Mandy Pepperidge's window in Animal House.<br /><br />Not only is American Pie filled with memorable scenes that left me rolling
in the aisles, but it also contains some of the funniest lines in movie
history.  How can anyone not appreciate a line like &quot;One time in band
camp,
I stuck a flute in my p**sy.&quot;<br /><br />Much like Three O'Clock High, Weird Science and Some Kind of Wonderful,
American Pie dealt with real high school issues.  Not only did it make you
nostalgic for your high school days, but it was also edgy and offered
scenes
that many directors would dare not show in today's super-PC world.  In
fact,
they even had to edit the scene involving Finch and Stifler's mom on the
pool table, since the actor who played Finch was only 17 years-old at the
time of filming.<br /><br />As a lover of cheesy 80s movies, I'm glad someone finally made a movie to
compete with the classics turned out a decade ago.
