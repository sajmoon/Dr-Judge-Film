&quot;American Pie&quot; is a movie that I happen to like tremendously.  Some parts
of
it were funny.  The overall context of this film deals with friendship and
romance issues, in addition to the sex-related material.  Although most of
the actors have not been in movies before, I thought that they did a
fantastic job of bringing their characters to life.  I recommended this
movie to all my friends and family. This movie is so wonderful that nobody
should miss it!  In my opinion, it is way better than &quot;10 Things I Hate
About You&quot;.
