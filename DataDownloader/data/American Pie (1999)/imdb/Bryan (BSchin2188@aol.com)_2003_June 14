Who ever thinks that poisoning a kid with laxitives is funny needs their
head examined.  And that stupid, stupid scene where Jason Biggs keeps
blowing his chance with that foreign chick?  &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; relies on
witty humor, word exchange and the like for it's humor.  This movie relies
on extraordinarily stupid teenagers to get it's laughs.  The only comedy
that was worse than this is &quot;American Pie 2&quot;.  If this movie is the
definitve comedy of it's time, then I think it's time to take humans off of
the &quot;intelligent lifeforms&quot; list.  I laugh at the Exorcist more than I did
at this, and it's sequel combined.
