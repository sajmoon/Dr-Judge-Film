1999_November 6 

This film is one of the most witty and original films of the
decade!!<br /><br />The gags are new, and different, and the writers have been cunning enough
to
put in a film what we only think about (well, with some
exceptions)!!<br /><br />It's well written, acted, produced and observed, and if you have a sense of
humour you WILL find this funny!!<br /><br />I suggest you check it out, and have a piece, and remember, you can always
have second helpings of 'American Pie'!!
