Ah, the famous &quot;American Pie&quot;. How much has this movie been apart of
our culture? How many parodies? How many immatators? Etc, etc, etc. I
wasn't too pleased with &quot;American Pie&quot;. I don't mind a little gross
humor every now and then. But the whole pie and Jason Biggs scene was a
little too much for me. While the movie has it's moments, and a few
good laughs, it's too much being thrown at. I don't know, maybe this is
the ultimate &quot;guy&quot; movie. I think that's why. But I'm still going to be
nice and give the sequels a chance. I mean, sometimes the sequels are
better than the first. Hopefully. Wish me luck!<br /><br />4/10
