1999_July 16 

I'll never look at an apple pie the same way again!!!! Lots of unexpected
and surprising laughs arise out of situations which could happen to any of
us. Eugene Levy is perfectly cast as the father of a typical horny
teenager
living vicariously through his son. Dads of teenage sons should see this
movie to give them the inspiration and confidence to talk to their sons
about sex. Gives a whole new meaning to the term &quot;pale
ale&quot;!
