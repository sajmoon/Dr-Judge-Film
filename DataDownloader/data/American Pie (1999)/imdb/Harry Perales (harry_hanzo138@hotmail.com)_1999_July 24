1999_July 24 

Of course for those of you people who don't get it, Wild Wild West
sucked.
That's why it's the funniest. Well, to American Pie....<br /><br />Austin Powers 2 had its laughs, but was not as great as i had expected.
South Park was super hilarious. South Park beats American Pie. Because
American Pie is full of preps. And has stupidly mushy scenes. That girl
&quot;OZ&quot;
liked wasn't that pretty at all.  Sorry lady. Well, I laughed my ass off.
I would see it again. I
probably will. This movie will guarantee laughter. I never knew what
&quot;Lacross&quot; was until I saw this movie. It is gross but hilarious.<br /><br />So what do I give it? An 8 out of 10. It lost 2 points for some stupid
mushy scenes between preppy people. It just made me feel &quot;Oh go is that?
Yes
that's Blink 182. 'The sellouts'&quot;.   Can you believe a girl on MTV who
likes
N'Sync said &quot;I like Blink 182 and the whole Cailfornia Punk scene&quot;? Not
not
a scene from &quot;American Pie&quot; just a quote some girl said about Blink 182.
Stupid poser.
