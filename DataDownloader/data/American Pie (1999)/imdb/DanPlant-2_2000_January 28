Before watching this movie, I thought it would be a lot like &quot;There's
Something About Mary;&quot; overly crude, real in your face, with a lot of
stupid
acting characters in it.  Somewhat enjoyable, but not as funny as others
made it out to be.  However, I was greatly surprised to find this an
excellent teen movie.  On the surface, there are the cruder aspects of
teenage years: sex and bathrooms.  But when you actually watch this movie,
instead of dismissing at as a gross-out film, you will notice the
excellent
direction of the Weitz brothers, the small details that they put into each
character that make them more than the caricatures so common in movies
today.  Every actor contributes to that effort by really getting into the
mindset of a graduating HS senior.  The maturing of each character is
evident and encouraging.  See this movie with an open mind, and you will
be
thoroughly entertained.
