I saw &quot;American Pie&quot; in July '99 when it first came to the theater,
something I rarely do anymore with DVD and &quot;home theater&quot; at my disposal.
Anyway, I remember clearly, when the lights went on at the end a young lady
looked around and told her boyfriend, &quot;Look at all the old people in here.&quot; 
I was one of &quot;the old people.&quot; This week my wife and I saw the highly
mutilated version, sanitized for TV, and it is only a shadow of the real
film.<br /><br />Simple plot - 4 friends make a pact to lose their virginity before
graduation from high school.  That thin thread motivates all the situations
that follow. The movie is bad because it depicts &quot;SEX&quot; as a somewhat
frivolous activity that all boys, and many girls, spend much of their free
time thinking about. That's my real gripe about films like this, it cheapens
relationships and gives already confused teenagers and young adults more
motivation for immoral behavior.<br /><br />Still, there are a few genuinely funny scenes. My favorite is the
extra-powerful laxative that results in the kid going quickly, but into the
girls' restroom. The internet video of &quot;Nadia&quot; changing and getting sexy in
the boy's room. The &quot;sex talks&quot; between son and father. The &quot;contaminated&quot;
beer on the nightstand. Mom and dad coming into his room while we was
getting off on watching scrambled porn on TV. <br /><br />There are a few sweet moments at the end, however the film overall has a
very flawed message and in a generous mood I rate it &quot;4&quot; of
10.
