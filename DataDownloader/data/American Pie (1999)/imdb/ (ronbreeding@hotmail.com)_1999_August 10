&quot;American Pie&quot; sounds like your average teen comedy, but it  has a
certain
sweetness that wins you over despite some rather gross gags along the way.
A cast of mostly unknown but gorgeous teen actors star as high school kids
struggling with sexuality and love.  Four senior boys vow to lose their
virginity by prom night, and set out to do so in varying ways.  We laugh
at
their fumbling attempts, but also root for them to succeed.  In the end,
we've seen a guy &quot;do it&quot; with an apple pie, but also seen a realistic
portrayal of teen love.  What's more, the featured characters are not
jocks,
cheerleaders or even popular.  It's refreshing to see a movie that would
even assume high school seniors could be virgins.
&quot;American Pie&quot; is a fine date movie and will entertain young and old
alike.<br /><br />
