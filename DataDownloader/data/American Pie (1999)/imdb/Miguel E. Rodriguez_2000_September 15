What is it about this movie that makes it eligible for repeat viewing?  Why
is it funny?  It's gross, sexist, lewd, crude, and many of the situations
are socially unacceptable...definitely not a first-date flick.  But it's
just so darn funny!  Why?  Why, why, why?<br /><br />Many comparisons have been made to &quot;Animal House&quot;, some favorable, most
UNfavorable.  In my humble, rank amateur's opinion, this picture is
superior.  There is no food fight, nor is there anyone who remotely
approaches Belushi in terms of comic talent.  But the story is not as
preposterous in &quot;American Pie.&quot;  It stays real to the characters without
having to resort to something that distracts from the main goal of the
picture.  People in &quot;Pie&quot; do wacky things, but you believe them.  People in
&quot;Animal House&quot; do wacky things, but there is no clear motivation.  Okay,
these movies are not necessarily concerned with such mundane tasks as
finding motivations for every action, but there was more of it in &quot;Pie&quot; than
there was in &quot;Animal House.&quot;  Since it was more believable, it seemed more
natural, and thus it was funnier because the characters were just being
themselves without TRYING to be funny.  And since it's funnier, it's more
watchable and eligible for repeat viewing.<br /><br />Then again, I could be wrong.  Though I doubt it.
