American Pie is a film about virginity, and the race to lose it.  The film
looks at the exploits of four friends who make a pact to 'become men' by
prom night.  What makes this difficult is thae fact that only one has a
girlfriend, and even she doesn't know if she wants to go all the way.  Of
the other three, one is a jock who has to learn how to treat ladies with a
little more respect, and the other two are completely inept at even talking
to girls.  Needless to say, this mix provides for some great laughs and
entertainment.<br /><br />American pie is crude, there's no doubt about it.  Some scenes push the
limit of taste, but it is very, very funny.  You will never again see an
apple pie the same way; this same goes for flutes, 'pale ale', 'nature'
channels and 'helping' out foreign students.<br /><br />The acting was also pretty good.  The scenes with Jim's dad were absolute
classics.  Poor old Jim gets caught every time he tries something different.<br /><br />I was just about rolling around on the cinema floor.<br /><br />All in all, a funny film that's not meant to be taken with a grain of salt;
it has no real message, it's not serious, but you'll leave with a smile on
your face, and if you're old enough, will bring back fond memories of your
own escapades as a high school kid.<br /><br />
