American Pie starts out slowly, and at first we thought this one was going
to be a waste of our time and money, but as the characters were developed on
the screen we got to know and like them.  We especially liked how they &quot;grew
up&quot; somewhat during their quest for the &quot;pie&quot;.  Overall, the story hung
together and our time was well spent.
