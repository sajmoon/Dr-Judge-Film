American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on
conservative levels.  And that can be summed up by one word as does not not
work for conservatives- Pie.  This film has many teen stars that will
probably make it as good actors (New Jersey native Jason Biggs is in 2000's
Loser already).  Also, this film is the best for teenagers looking for a
laugh after Austin Powers 2.  <br /><br />The story is simple, but the scenes are expanded.  The plot involves 4
seniors who want to lose their virginity by the end of the school year. 
What ensues is a journey that makes Dumb and Dumber look like The Winslow
Boy.  Pastry sex, lacetive dumps, premature ejaculation, the sex books and
Eugene Levy provide the best parts of the film, and the romance provides the
parts when we can pause from laughing.  Because this film is one of the best
comedies and films of the decade.  A+
