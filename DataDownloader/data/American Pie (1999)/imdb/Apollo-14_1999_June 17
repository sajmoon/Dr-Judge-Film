1999_June 17 

I can understand the industry's latest fixation for movies with teenage
actors aimed for a teenage audience.  But I never understood why they had
to
be so lame; don't they respect teenagers' IQs?<br /><br />Not that I expected sophistication from this genre of movies but a little
more originality than throwaways like Varsity Blues and Cruel Intentions.
Something started with Go and now there is American Pie.  This movie is
still very much juvenile but I found it drop dead funny.  Countless
masturbation and sex jokes and high school pranks, it makes me miss my
high
school days.  It's fun to shut off your brain once in a while and just
have
some fun at the movies.  This is a good comedy.
