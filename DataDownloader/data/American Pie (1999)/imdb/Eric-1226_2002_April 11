I basically agree with the previous commenter Dave, in that this movie comes
across as an obvious teen sexploitation flick. Yes, agreed, it's gross,
lame, juvenile, sensationalistic, vulgar, vapid, and... oh, never mind, you
get my drift.<br /><br />But I do part company with the previous commenter in one respect, and that
is that I don't believe any of this silly mish-mash as being &quot;true&quot;, not for
one minute. This movie, to my eye anyway, simply does NOT depict real
true-to-life teenagers with their real problems (other than that most
relevant one - getting laid before graduation) and real anxieties and
insecurities. <br /><br />I thought most of the teens in this film seemed unrealistically
sophisticated, and my &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; suffered a fatal blow right
from the opening. Hey, where were the pimples? (It's also supposed to be set
in Michigan, but is obviously filmed in sunny Southern California, thus
adding to more of the feeling of fakiness that I got from this movie. Geez,
is it really so hard to get a cast and crew up to Michigan these
days??).<br /><br />Be that as it may, it is an okay film as a parody of teen life, and even has
some poignant moments in it. Just don't take it too seriously, and be
prepared to be grossed out more than a few times (and for God's sake don't
let your teenage son or daughter see it!!!:)
