This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The first one
beats all the other American Pie movies. The jokes are incredible. I
was laughing so much, I thought that I would puke or I would suffer a
heart attack from all my laughing. The acting was great. In my opinion,
I thought that Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas were the best.
Jennifer Coolidge had great cameos as Stifler&#39;s Mom. The girls were
very hot and they got my attention. The script is excellent, the music
was just right, and this is a valuable piece for a large movie
collection such as mine. I highly recommend this for people between the
age of 15-40. Most adults after the age of 40 will think that this
movie is horrible and won&#39;t be able to understand most jokes. I give
this a definite 10/10.
