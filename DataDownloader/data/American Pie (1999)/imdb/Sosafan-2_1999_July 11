1999_July 11 

This was without a doubt the funniest movie I have seen since &quot;There's
Something About Mary&quot;.  In every seen there was something to make me
laugh,
and not just a chuckle, but a full let it out blast.  I wasn't embarrassed
because the whole theater burst into laughter at the same time.  And it
had
great music too, sometimes I found myself singing along, quietly of
course.
The bottom line is I think that teens should go and see this movie because
it is great, but probably no one under 13 should be let in.  I have seen 4
high school movies this year (She's All That, 10 Things I Hate About You,
Never Been Kissed, and this one) and this was by far the best one.  I know
I
will probably see this movie again soon because it was so
good.
