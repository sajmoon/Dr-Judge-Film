American Pie is a great movie. Why? I'll try to explain...
When I first saw the film i laughed at the scenes where Jim was discovering
his own sexuality, or lack thereof. But if you think about it for a second,
isn't that the problem of many, many American teens nowadays? Adults are
constantly proclaiming that sex is bad, something you should stay away from
until you are at least 67! I so very often see adult Americans tell their
mid-puberty-hormones-going-wild teen kids to stay away from all things fun,
and not to forget - natural. &quot;We accept the world presented to us&quot; Ed Harris
said in The Truman Show, and I agree to that. If I were told all my life
that blue actually is red - I would believe it, but that doesn't make it
right. American Pie shows us all that sex is a problem teens struggle with,
and it is the parents obligation and privelidge to assist and guide their
children. A very important point here is &quot;guide&quot;, it's better to tell your
children &quot;how to&quot; rater &quot;not to&quot;, I believe. &quot;Man shaped in Gods vision&quot;
ring a bell? Just kidding.
We need more reality in films, especially American films. Even a comedy like
American Pie can have an important story to tell, and I believe this film
gived it a very good try, perfect I'd say. Today's society needs some
&quot;Grrrr&quot; and &quot;Swinging, baby&quot; as a great british spy would
say!
So my final comment is that American Pie is a great film, very funny, the
actors do a good job portraying young frustrated, scared and real teenagers
longing for &quot;love&quot;. It makes a good point which can be helpful in life, for
both parents and children. Is it dangerous to tell kids that sex is
allright? No!
Love and sexuality is a great thing! And it's important.
