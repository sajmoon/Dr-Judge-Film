So no, this is not a film only young guys can enjoy. It's gross,
over-the-top, and objectifies females, but it does it all in SUCH a funny
way! Come on people, get over it. Pretty much anything can be made funny,
and sex will always be one of the biggest sources of humor.<br /><br />To me one of the funniest scenes is when one guy runs to the bathroom and
tries to cover the seat with toilet paper, but the dispenser only gives one
square at a time. An inhumane invention that I doubt has ever been shown on
the screen before!
