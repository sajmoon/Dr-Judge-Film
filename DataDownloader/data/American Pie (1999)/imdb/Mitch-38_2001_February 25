Another easy Hollywood &quot;we know where the money is&quot; plot formula, marketing
heavily at those discretionary incomes. Four comely lads looking to lose
their virginity, as they're tired of just being comely. Yes, as I recall in
high school, it was always the good looking dudes that had the toughest time
scoring... Okay, now that we understand the movie isn't exactly grounded in
reality, it is actually pretty funny in quite a few spots. Yes, the humor
tends towards the raunchy, and one won't need a discussion group after, yet
the performances are rather endearing and earnest. This helps AMERICAN PIE
considerably, and keeps it on track towards its audience. Light fare worth a
look.
