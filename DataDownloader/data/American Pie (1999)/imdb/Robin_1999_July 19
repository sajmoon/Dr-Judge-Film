1999_July 19 

Only two movies this summer have I particularly enjoyed and wanted to go
back to see again.  This was one of them...i have already seen it twice.
An
important part of this movie is that I don't really think anyone over 30
can
really enjoy the comedy.  They don't understand how perverted and sick
teenagers are these days.  Not only did I laugh out of my seat but I was
also touched as well.  It had memorable characters, friendships and a
strong
plot.  If you even think it has anything to do with Something About Mary
then you were only paying attention to the masterbation and in turn missed
the humor all together.
