In my opinion, this is a good movie with raunchy content. One thing I
hated most was the nudity, especially when Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth)
was pleasuring herself on Jim&#39;s (Jason Biggs) bed. The reason I found
this was because she had no top on. In my opinion, this movie had very
funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part
was when Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) was in the toilet. The thing I liked
most was the prom. Before I wrap this up, I&#39;d like to say, &quot;If I ever
have kids of my own, I&#39;m not going to let them see this movie until
they&#39;re grown up.&quot; Now, in conclusion, I&#39;d like to say, &quot;Parents, don&#39;t
let your children see this until they&#39;re grown up!&quot;
