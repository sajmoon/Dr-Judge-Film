Aside from being an extremely funny movie, the friendship dynamic shown
by the four main characters made this movie. Although #2 may have been
funnier, the story line was much better. Sean William Scott as
&quot;Stifler&quot; was by far the most humorous in the film, and should have had
more face time. His facial expressions, tone and lines were all
hilarious. He played the dumb jock/player perfectly. This was one of
the best characters I have ever seen in any film. All four main
characters were very good in their roles. Eddie Kaye Thomas as &quot;Finch&quot;
was another great character. The dynamic between him and Stifler
throughout the film were extremely entertaining. &quot;Oz&quot; was the most
suave of the four, but lacked in the comedy department. Eugene Levy
played the awkward dad very well. Although &quot;Kevin&quot; was somewhat
annoying at times, his final scene with Tara Reid added just about the
only drama element, and anyone who has had their heart broken can
empathize with him. This film will become the next &quot;Animal House&quot; and
be a required college flick.
