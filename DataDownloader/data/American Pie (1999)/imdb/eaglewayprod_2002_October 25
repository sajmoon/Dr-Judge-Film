Oh My gosh this is a great comedy. I could hardly stop laughing. I haven't
seen a teen comedy like this since Fast Times at Ridgement High. This is a
great great comedy film. Parents I highly recommend you don't let your
young
children watch this. But for everyone else it's a must see and also go see
the sequel.
