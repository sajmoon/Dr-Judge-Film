I don't care what anyone says! This movie was AWFUL! I hated everything
about this boring, pathetic, unfunny waste of time. I would have walked
out
of the theater, when I had the misfortune of seeing this movie, if I
wasn't
stuck in the middle of the theater. Don't waste your time on this pathetic
'comedy'. Out of 10 I give this movie -10.<br /><br />-10/10
