Where do you start... from flutes to pies, this pioneer teen movie has
it all. I&#39;m pretty sure this was the first DVD I ever saw, back in
2000. I do remember owing $20 in late fees to blockbuster video for
keeping it so long after it was due back. It was worth it! This has
classic written all over it, I think it&#39;s safe to say that anyone that
was involved with this movie has a great career now because of it.
American pie has an absolute all star cast led by the Great Jason biggs
Anyone who enjoys comedy, teen comedy must see this movie! honestly you
need to watch more movies if you haven&#39;t sen this one!!!<br /><br />10/10
