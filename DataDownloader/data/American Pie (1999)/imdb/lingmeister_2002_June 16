Seeing American Pie reminded me of Porky's, which spoke to the group of
people who were sex obsessed, desperate to get some, but could never get
any.  Much of the movie is getting caught in embarrassing situations in
which many of us had experienced but never caught, where those what ifs were
always in the back of our minds.  The movie also had its tender moments
unlike the typical sex starved teen movies, with the aspect of love, the
right person, waiting for the right time themes thrown
in.
