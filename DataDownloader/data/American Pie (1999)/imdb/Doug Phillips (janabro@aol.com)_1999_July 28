I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie -- but after I went I was glad I
did.<br /><br />This is a truly funny movie.<br /><br />Four High School senior boys make a pact to lose their virginity by prom
night.<br /><br />The big question is will they, and eventually, do they really want
to?<br /><br />While you could never say they are richly textured, fully dimensional
characters they are very entertaining.<br /><br />A real standout performance is by Alyson Hannigan as Michelle the geeky band
chick -- her &quot;In band camp...&quot; diatribes were hilarious.<br /><br />No one was too pretty to be believable -- Seann William Scott as Stifler was
the token pretty boy but he ends up as the one you may actually feel sorry
for.  His good looks don't get him anywhere.<br /><br />The way the Internet is used almost as another character really brings this
film into the 90's.  <br /><br />The humour is broad, unsubtle and always over the top but funny
nonetheless.
