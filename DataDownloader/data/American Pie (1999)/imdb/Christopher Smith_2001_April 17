Any movie that's main gag is a kid doing sexual things with a pie is
guranteed to be a pretty bad 90 minutes. Not only is it bad, it is also
disturbing. I mean this movie is about nothing other than sex. It's like a
porno movie starring teens. This movie shouldn't be as popular as it is.
It's plot is stupid, the characters are complete perverts, the humor is
absolutely appauling, and the acting is just terrible. Also, I don't know
how this got by with an R rating. Frankly, I don't see how this could even
get an NC-17 rating. It's the most vulgar movie ever made. I can't believe
Universal is making a sequel to this garbage. I can't even belive Universal
made this movie at all. It's the worst movie that will ever be made. It's
not funny, it's just gross.
