I really cannot praise this film highly enough. It may not be high-brow
(understatement!) or particularly clever, but don&#39;t let that fool you.
Unlike the increasingly tired sequels, the original American Pie,
balanced a large cast of believable characters through some of the
finest set pieces in cinema.<br /><br />The list of great characters goes on and on; &quot;Jim&quot; the main character,
Stiffler, Finch, The MILF, Jim&#39;s Dad, Nadia etc etc. Every character
has a purpose and they all given screen time so that we appreciate the
situations that they face.<br /><br />American Pie reignited the Teen-genre and a whole new generation of
gross out films like Road Trip, Old School etc owe AP a debt.<br /><br />If by some miracle you have yet to see this film go and treat yourself
to the DVD - and laugh your nuts off whilst Jim and Co screw around,
f*ck things up, and generally have a fantastic time.
