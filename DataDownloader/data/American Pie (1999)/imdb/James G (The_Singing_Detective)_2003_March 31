This film when I first heard about it i wasn't that interested, but then I
saw the second one and was blown away at how funny it was. The second one
was just pure fun, where the first one i watched and was like 'my god they
living the american version of my life (although somethings do differ) but
Jim is the greatest character, and his friends are great. Oz, Finch, Kev and
of course, Stifler.<br /><br />This movie is very funny and ends up with you thinking 'well done guy, well
done.' Brilliant.
