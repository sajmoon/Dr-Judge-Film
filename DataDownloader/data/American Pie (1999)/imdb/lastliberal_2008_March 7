I went into this thinking that it was going to be crude and filled with
fart jokes, but I was really surprised. Sure, on the surface it is
crude, but underneath was a very good story of young men trying to grow
into adulthood.<br /><br />The hardest thing is picking whom I liked the most. Jason Biggs was
great in his second film, but so was Chris Klein, who really grew, and
Eddie Kaye Thomas (Harold &amp; Kumar). And Mena Suvari (Kiss the Girls)
was fantastic, as was Natasha Lyonne.<br /><br />It was a funny and, at times, very tender movie that was entertaining
from start to finish. I&#39;ll have to check out the sequels.
