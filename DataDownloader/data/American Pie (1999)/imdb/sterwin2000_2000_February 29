What a terrible disappointment this movie turned out to be!<br /><br />Movies like Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Flying High, Spaceballs etc. etc.
belong to my favorite movies of all time, so I was looking forward to this
so much. But this movie never even came close to those classics.<br /><br />What made the other movies so good was that even though the jokes were
stupid, there was a sort of cleverness in them. This movie lacked that
cleverness all together. Almost all jokes were predictable and therefore
not
very funny.<br /><br />Also a lot of the story lines and jokes seemed to be derived from old jokes
of other movies, which made them less funny because they weren't
new.<br /><br />Highlight of the movie for me was the 'Shermanator'. This kid reminded me
of
Anthony Michael Hall is his young years, and almost singlehandedly saved
the
movie for me.<br /><br />So all in all not a terribly bad movie, but certainly not a great one.
