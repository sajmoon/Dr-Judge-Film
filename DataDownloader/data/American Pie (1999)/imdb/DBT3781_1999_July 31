1999_July 31 

I absolutely love this film!  Whether America was ready or not, a movie with
this much likeness to the concept of sex in today's youth was LONG overdue.
While many recent teen films such as VARSITY BLUES, JAWBREAKER, and even the
happily-ever-after SHE'S ALL THAT have touched on sex in their movies, it
has been only the tip of the iceberg of how us teens really are when it
comes to sex.<br /><br />I am an 18 year old male, recently graduated from a small town high school
where sex is an important focus of adolescents.  For most of us, sex doesn't
come that easy or smoothly, so people indeed needed somewhat of a reality
check, which is adequately portrayed in this film.  I highly recommend this
movie to any adults who want a sufficient glance at sex in high school,
teens who want a night of laughter (and a new topic of discussion), and
children who desire their first peek at what's to come in the next few
years.
