Ok, I'm in the target audience and found nothing funny about this movie.
The
only thing I could relate to was the character who didn't want to poop at
school because school toilets are nasty. That probably saved me from
leaving
the room as the movie played. It also helped that I didn't pay the rental
fee to watch a movie that I believe can diminish your brain cells as you
watch.
