American Pie stands out in my mind immediately as a &quot;great film&quot;.  The score
was full of excellent music that plays along with the mood and the
characters were three-dimensional and acted out a great
script.<br /><br />This film is hilarious.  Non-stop laughs are seamlessly combined with
well-developed emotional content.  You will never find yourself let down
with anything that happens, the plot carries you on to each step
successfully and beautifully.  A big plus is watching as the characters
develop and grow - as well as waiting to see what will surprise you
next.<br /><br />As the ending approaches you may begin to wonder how the finale can top the
rest of the movie.  In the final climax you will laugh, you may cry, but you
will not be able to leave for the bathroom.  You will not be
disappointed.<br /><br />The teenage-oriented, sex-crazed humor may bother some people.  If you're
looking for a love story along the lines of &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;,
then you need to shift your expectations.  Though the movie delivers well in
story-development and romance, it is walked along with humor and surprise. 
Overall, this film has an excellent cast, great score, and plenty of
good-natured humor which come together to produce a wholly entertaining and
enjoyable experience.
