&quot;American Pie&quot; was truly a movie that shows the average teenager going
through major sexual scenarios. I should know, since I AM a teenager. :)
Plus, I laughed my butt off in the progress.  I never thought I could
watch a
movie in a theater and be allowed to fall on the floor and laugh so hard,
that the guy next to you would tell you to be quiet. It was a true
masterpiece of teenage intelligence. The sex, the humor and whatever was
in-between just made me EXPLODE in laughter.<br /><br />On a side note, it was really good to see Eugene Levy do a recent role due
of the fact that I haven't seen him in any movies lately. I would like to
see him do some more movies in the near future. This is some great
Canadian
talent we are missing. Even though his role in, &quot;American Pie&quot; wasn't much
on the silver screen, he still made me laugh before he said anything.<br /><br />Cheers to the American Pie cast and crew! Great Work!
