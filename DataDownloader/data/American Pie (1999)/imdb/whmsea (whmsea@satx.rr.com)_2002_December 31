How r-rated is r-rated exactly? Well, this proves how far teen movies will
go these days.I was apalled, embarassed, delighted, all at the same time.
Based on purely sex, this is comedy heaven.It pushed barriers, and
introduced the now imfamous line &quot;Mr.Finch, are you trying to seduce me?&quot;
and the webcam expose of Shannon Elizabeth,and those warm band camp
stories
we've come to love, and the pie scene. You'll cry, laugh, and cringe. Send
the kids to your mothers, and go see this!
