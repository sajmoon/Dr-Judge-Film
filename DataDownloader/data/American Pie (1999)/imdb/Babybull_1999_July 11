1999_July 11 

The Porky's of the nineties?  Definitely.  Another appropriate likeness
could be &quot;Dawson's Creek does Porno&quot;.  It is a very wild comedy that is a
constant barrage of utterly embarrassing sexual situations that our cast
of
teens are put through.  The cast does a great acting job.  The plot is
kind
of weak, but doesnt really matter.  Its the humor in this movie that gets
high marks in my opinion.  I would highly recommend this movie if you are
into very vulgar sex comedy.  If not, this is  a movie you would want to
avoid.  7 out of 10 stars.
