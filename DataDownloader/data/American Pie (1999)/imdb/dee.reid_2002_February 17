&quot;American Pie&quot; doesn't sound like much because of its simple premise: four
guys(Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas)
enter into a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  Now it's only
natural that this movie would be immediately dismissed as another dumb sex
comedy, but I believe that &quot;American Pie&quot; is much more than that.  Now I'm
no expert, but I believe that there is a lot of hidden subtext here.  One of
the scenes that I want to focus on, is the scene where Jim(Biggs) and
Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth) are in his bedroom.  Now since Jim had walked in
Nadia, she probably felt embarrassed and wanted to see the opposite effect
on him.  When it's finally time to get down to &quot;business&quot;, Jim by this time
is so nervous that he n**s his boxers.  Nadia is then about ready to leave. 
Jim desperate and realizing that this may be the only chance he has with
Nadia, starts to bring out the porn.  Nadia forgives him and they start to
go at it again but then Jim blows his second chance.  I believe that this is
probably the most important scene in this whole movie.  I say this because I
think it was meant to show how nervous some people may get about first-time
sex.  Now just because Jim had blown his big chance with Nadia, does not
mean that she will think any lesser of him.  I mean after all, it was their
first time doing anything together.  Now another part, which is the case of
Sherman(Chris Owen) a.k.a. &quot;The Sherminator&quot;.  Sherman is so sure of
himself, that many people including our four heroes, think that he can score
with any girl he meets.  This is wrong and this ultimately leads to his
timely humiliation at the prom.  Strangely enough, his whole &quot;Sherminator&quot;
act is only able to successfully attract the attention of one lucky lady(try
to guess who).  Third is the case with Stifler(Seann William Scott).  Now
I'm sure we've all known of at least one Stifler in our lives.  My
definition of someone who is a &quot;Stifler&quot;, is a person who only lives to
party, have sex, and makes fun of those who can't; Stifler-&quot;see you guys in
the 'NO F*****G' section&quot;.  What girls see in him or how he's even able to
get girls is beyond me.  Fourth is the rapidly evolving dating relationship
with Kevin(Nicholas) and his girlfriend, Vicky(Tara Reid).  We know that
these two have been going out for quite some time.  Kevin is quite anxious
to move to another base.  As he says, &quot;enough of this b-job bulls**t&quot;. 
Vicky, feeling unappreciated that she probably can't please her boyfriend
enough, dumps him.  Kevin then has to resort to &quot;Kama Sutra: The Book of
Love&quot;.  He begins reading the stuff in the book is eventually able to win
back Vicky.  Fifth, how many of you have ever tried to change the way you
act just to win a girl's heart?  I'm sure some of you have and Oz(Klein) is
doing just that.  After the fiasco with Oz's first date, he begins to see
things in a different light.  &quot;You can't try to win a girl over by repeating
cheese-ball lines&quot; says his date.  Oz then takes this into account and after
entering into the pact, he spots a young choir girl(Mena Suvari).  So Oz
signs up for chorus just to win her heart.  At first he's just doing to get
to her but then true love comes into play he finds himself vying for her
affections.  He is eventually able to win her over but not by his physique
or duty to the pact, but by his determination to find true love.  Sixth, is
the minor situation with Jim and Michelle, the band geek(played by Alyson
Hannigan).  Michelle- &quot;this one time at band camp...&quot; you know the rest. 
This relationship here is probably one of the higher aspects of &quot;American
Pie&quot; because it goes to show you that you can't just put a label on anybody
no matter how weird they appear to be.  Sure Jim ends up regretting his
decision to sleep with her, but in the end, he'll really thank her for it
and he will be glad he did.  Lastly, dear old Finch(Thomas).  Isn't it
strange the things that we do out of desperation?   <br /><br />Now are you beginning to see what I've been getting at?  This movie is
showing us how our sex lives have or may turn out to be like.  Not all of
our encounters will turn out to be total disasters and we won't end up doing
it with baked goods(hopefully).  Some of us may turn out to be a &quot;Sherman&quot;
or a &quot;Stifler&quot; or maybe some us won't turn out to be anything at all.  Some
of us may have to change our personalities completely to just to win a
girl's affections.  Some of us may end up having to resort to extreme
measures to get what we want.<br /><br />
