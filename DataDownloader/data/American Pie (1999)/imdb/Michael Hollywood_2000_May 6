Finally, I have seen a movie that made me laugh hard and told the truth
about the main plot of the movie.<br /><br />American Pie&quot; is a crude movie and should not be seen by young teens by
themselves. The performances were exceptional all the way around from Jason
Biggs to Chris Klein to Mena Suvari.<br /><br />The best part about this movie is that the cast enjoyed &amp; knew what they
were doing at the same time. I must give credit  to the Weitz brothers for
an outstanding and convincing job how high school really is.<br /><br />This is a well done movie with an okay plot, great performances and great
direction by the director.
