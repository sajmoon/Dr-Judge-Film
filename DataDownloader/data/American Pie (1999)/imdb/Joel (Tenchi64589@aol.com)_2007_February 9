I&#39;m not a movie snob in any sense of the word, but I can tell when I
see an awful movie.<br /><br />To start off, the first time I saw this movie, it wasn&#39;t even my
idea... it was my father&#39;s insinuation that I wanted to see it.<br /><br />How anyone can like this movie is beyond me: the plot is highly
unoriginal, Just looking at half of the cast makes me want to vomit
violently, and the &quot;dialogue&quot; sounds like a foul-mouthed 14-year old
wrote it.<br /><br />If you want an intelligent movie with actual laughs, watch anything BUT
this.<br /><br />0/10
