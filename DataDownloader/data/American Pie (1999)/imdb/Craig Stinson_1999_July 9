1999_July 9 

I entered the theatre expecting another &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;
ripoff and it appeared as though that was exactly what I was getting --
another film filled with juvenile humour.  But something surprising
happened.  After the first few scenes, &quot;American Pie&quot; became a smart and
downright funny picture and I became caught up in the characters (how
often
does that happen in a comedy?).  The plot is surprisingly solid and, even
more incredibly, relatively unpredictable, there are plenty of laughs,
and,
even though the ending is a little weak, I highly recommend this movie.
It's much, much better than &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; could ever
dream
of being.
