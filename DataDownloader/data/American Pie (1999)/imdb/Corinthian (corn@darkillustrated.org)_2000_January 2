A lot of low-brow, shock/toilet humour, is all it is.  Little kids will
obviously love it.  I thought it was more or less decent, until my friends
recently forced me to watch the &quot;Unrated&quot; version on video. I didn't notice
too much difference, except that it was much more apparent how lame it was
this time around.  All my friends were laughing at the jokes, so I guess it
works for some.  The only memorable moments: The slick Shermanator, and the
brilliant booty dances (whenever they think their friends are on their way
to getting booty).  And of course, if eye candy is what you're looking for,
there's Shannon Elizabeth and Tara Reid.
