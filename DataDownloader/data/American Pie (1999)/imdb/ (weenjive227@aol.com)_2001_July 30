The problem with this movie is not that it is crude.  Its just not funny.
Everything in this movie misses its mark.  There is a fine line between
grosse out humor and just plain grosse.  The only line in this movie came
from the most annoying person in the movie, the band camp girl.  when she
tells about inserting a flute into the neither regions.  i just lost it.
that was the only time i laughed in the entire film.  I think i would have
like this film more if i were a teen, and stoned!
