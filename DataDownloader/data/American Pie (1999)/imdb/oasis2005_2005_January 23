when this came out i wasn't bothered about seeing it, and when ever it
was on i would change channel because i thought it would be like every
other teen film but when my brother bought it on DVD i watched it and i
thought it was AMAZING i watched two times in a row and i couldn't get
it out of my head , the next night i rented the second out which was
amazing as well and the third one the night after and i was not
disappointed. it is a classic of its genre and i don't think any teen
film can compare to it. the main character Jim is excellent as well as
his dad and stliffler its great the whole cast make the film
tremendous, next time you're in the video shop and you have not seen it
take a look at it. 10/10 *****
