'American Pie' is a funny coming of age film. For all the crude humor, the
movie is really rather sweet. Although the boys start out just looking for
a
good time, they end up finding love and even maturity. The girls are the
ones who are in control of the situation. Alyson Hannigan especially
offers
lots of laughs as a band geek. Don't be fooled by the marketing and hype,
this 'Pie' is warm and touching.
