Sure, its crude.  Yeah, its juvenile.  But its absolutely
hilarious.  I went to see it without having seen any movie
trailers, and that made a HUGE difference.  Everything was a
surprise.  After seeing the movie, I did watch a trailer, and
was glad I missed it before.  It gave everything away!<br /><br />Even if you have seen the trailer, go see the movie.  It is
fun
