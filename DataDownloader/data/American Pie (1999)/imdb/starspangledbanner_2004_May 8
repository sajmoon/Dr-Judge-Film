American Pie is one of my favourite ever films. This is the film that
really
defined the teen genre. The likes of Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott and
Eddie Kaye Thomas have become fave actors of mine as a result of this
wonderful film. It's packed full of laughs, has some memorable moments and
also really makes you feel good. This was good and so were the 2 sequels,
'American Pie 2' and 'American Wedding'. The tale of the best friends
whose
plan to lose their virginity before prom night leads to some hilarious
consequences is and always will be a cult classic for many years to come.
A
classic, top quality teen flick which everyone who loves comedy cannot
afford to miss.
