2000_January 28 

Like at least one other reviewer, I initially avoided this movie because I
thought it was just another shallow teen-sex comedy. I finally relented
after reading some of the reviews here, and finding the video store out of
the movies I had actually gone for.  I was pleasantly surprised, to say
the
least.  Not only was the movie very funny, but it had some moral substance
as well (though I wouldn't recommend it to the very conservative).  I
understand that the only difference between the R rated and Unrated
versions
is the positioning in the pie scene, so take your pick.  I definitely
recommend this film to anyone who wants a good laugh.  I'm a 39-year-old
single father of three who would describe himself as moderately
conservative, and I loved it.  Give it a try!
