1999_July 10 

The buzz on this raunchy teen comedy has been building for some time now,
with some predicting it to be (and comparing it to) this Summer's &quot;There's
Something About Mary.&quot;  While there's nothing blindingly original about
the
story, it DOES have its share of raunchy laughs and gross-out gags.  And
yes, it DOES have an unexpected sweetness and innocence laced throughout
it
similar to &quot;Mary,&quot; but without that film's mean-spiritedness.<br /><br />The young cast is very good, especially Jason Biggs as the innocent and
confused leader of the gang who all pledge to lose their virginity on prom
night...he seems to be the one caught in a majority of the most
embarrassing
situations, but admirably seems to escape with his dignity intact.  Eugene
Levy is extremely amusing as Biggs' father, trying to impart wisdom to his
son  but at the most inopportune times.<br /><br />A cut or two above most teen comedies and not as irresponsible as you
might
gather by the previews.  Very funny stuff!!
