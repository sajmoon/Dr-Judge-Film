This movie is so funny. I laughed my the whole movie.  My favorite part is
when Jim humps the pie. It was gross but, funny. I can't wait for the
sequel. I liked the unrated version better cause, some scenes were different
than the R version and was funnier. I recommend this movie to anyone who
likes a good comedy.
