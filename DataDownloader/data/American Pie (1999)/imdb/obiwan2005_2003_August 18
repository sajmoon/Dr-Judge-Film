'American Pie' is one of those rare comedies that fools you into thinking
it's a gross-out pointless bomb. But it isn't, it's actually filled with
tremendous heart. Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye
Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are out to lose their virginity
before their Senior year of High School is over. Along the way they get made
fun of by Jock-Jerk Stifler (Seann William Scott) and seduced by forgien
exchange students. While many gags are aimed torward teens the real stories
lie in Kevin's difficulty in figuring out if he loves his girlfriend Vicky
(Tara Reid) or not. And Oz's shedding his Jock persona and signing up for
Choir to prove to Heather (Mena Survari) how much she means to him. The
ensemble cast (which includes Natasha Lyonne and Eugene Levy) also makes the
movie such a joy to watch In the end, the adolecent mischief and curiousity
regarding sex becomes unlikely entertainment for teens that are going
through it and adults who want to remember.<br /><br />RATING: *** out of ****
