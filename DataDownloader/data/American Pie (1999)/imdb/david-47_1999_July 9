1999_July 9 

Let's get one thing straight up front. This is NOT a teenage sex comedy.
There is precious little sex in it. This is a bodily-fluid gross-out
movie.
The premise has been quoted so many times that viewers might be lulled
into
accepting that this is a movie about four teenagers trying to lose their
virginity by prom night. It isn't. That has nothing to do with the movie.
If
these guys are so desperate, how is it that two of them are suddenly asked
to the prom by girls? I saw this movie with its intended audience, almost
all late teens to early twenties. There was not so much as a chuckle for
the
first 25 minutes. There was only one moderately amusing sequence in the
entire movie. Only a few laughs, mostly embarrassed snickering at the
endless procession of toilet humor. Every joke was telegraphed. Even those
that might have had some slim chance of being funny if properly set up
failed miserably by just being thrown into the pile of excrement. Every
one,
without fail. Rather than looking for clever, interesting ways to set up
the
bad jokes, they just jumped in. It is a sad testament to the creative
bankruptcy infecting Hollywood that a studio payed $750,000 for this
script.
There was no script needed. Just have one of the characters expel some
bodily fluid every few minutes and the 12-year-old boys in the audience go
wild. Unfortunately, with an R rating, no one under 17 should be admitted,
and no one over 14 will be even the least bit amused.
