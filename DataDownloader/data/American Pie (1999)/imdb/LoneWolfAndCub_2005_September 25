American Pie is a hilarious, raunchy comedy that will have certain
people in fits.<br /><br />The plot is focused on a group of four friends: Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz
(Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)
and their sexual misadventures. All four of them make a pact to have
sex before college. Enter the stupidity. Jim is hopeless with women, Oz
has joined the choir, Finch is a loser and Kevin's girlfriend Vicki
(Tara Reid) doesn't want sex. Along the way we meet Stifler (Seann
William Scott), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan),
Heather (Mena Suvari), Chuck (Chris Owens) and Jessica (Natasha
Lyonne).<br /><br />This is a great comedy but unfortunately won't appeal to everyone. This
is targeted at a younger, teenage audience. The acting is pretty good
for a teenage comedy and the soundtrack is great. The humour is very
raunchy. Things like a naked European woman broadcast over the
internet, drinking sperm and laxatives. There is nudity of course and
plenty of language but it is a very funny movie that most teens should
find appealing.<br /><br />4/5.
