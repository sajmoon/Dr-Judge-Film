Out of all the teenage comedies we were bombarded with the last couple
of years, this one is by far the best. The comedy is cruel and perhaps
predictable but the execution of it is perfect, thanks to the actors
and the characters they portray and some excellent spot-on timing.<br /><br />Really what makes &#x22;American Pie&#x22; superior to other teenage comedies are
the characters. There are lots of characters in the movie and all are
well constructed, crazy in their own way and simply fun to watch. On
top of that their dialog is very good and highly realistic and
believable. Although I normally hate it when some teenagers are being
played by some twenty year old, I had in this case no problems with it,
simply because all of the actors fitted their roles like a glove. I
especially liked Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott. But best role of
the movie was played by Eugene Levy as Jim&#x27;s dad. Quite honestly one of
the best and most hilarious movie dads ever created!<br /><br />Most of the jokes and dialog are cruel and is mostly about only sex and
poop but it works surprisingly hilarious, with as a result some
hilarious classic comedy moments. Of course the apple pie sequences has
already become a bit of a classic but I even liked the whole web-cam
strip sequences with Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth even better.
Yes, I even liked the poop humor with Eddie Kaye Thomas as Finch in the
movie. There are truly some hilarious sequences in the movie that are
perhaps at first sight a bit lame and predictable but all perfectly
timed and performed by the actors. Poop- and sex humor just doesn&#x27;t get
any better than this! Plus it also has a good morale in it that works
out in the ending without ever getting lame or too over-the-top.<br /><br />A teenage comedy classic, that works in almost every way!<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
