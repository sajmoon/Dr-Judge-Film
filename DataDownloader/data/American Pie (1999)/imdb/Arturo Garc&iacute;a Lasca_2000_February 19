American Pie is a great comedy, in my honest opinion. I'd like to say its
very realistic, since every single problem in there and situations can
happen in real life, I've even had problems like that, and watching a movie
like that makes you feel like you're not the only one passing through all of
that stuff.<br /><br />None of the actors in this movie are really great, they all did a good job,
but nobody did something special.<br /><br />The movie was not good because of it's actors (hell no!), it was good
because of it shows things the way they are in real life. I think every
single teen ager (with a normal life) would love to watch this
movie.<br /><br />As a comedy it was very good, it made me laugh a few times (and long
laughs). But the good thing about this movie is that it's not just a comedy
that makes you laugh but has no script, this movie has a very nice script
that keeps you paying attention all the time, and you don't only get
interested waiting for a funny part, you want to know what's going to happen
with all the boys and the girls.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I watched it twice in the theaters. I'll
rate it with a 7 out of 10. If you're a teen go watch this
movie.
