My God, haven't we seen this done 100 times before? After the HUGE success
of Animal House (which is still brilliantly funny) Hollywood set out to
recap on the success. So a few short years later, came the so-so 'Porky's
(followed by terrible sequels) and now American Pie. When the opening scene
had a kid orgasm into a beer-only to have his friend drink it I knew this
movie was going no where fast. I suggest to avoid this and rent the 1980
adult classic &quot;American Pie.&quot;
