I haven's seen such a high school comedy since &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont
High.&quot;  I think this even tops it.  It was hilarious, but it really got into
the mind of the high school male.  Everyone knows this is how a majority of
high schoolers act and this is one of the first movies i've seen that shows
this attitude so raw.
