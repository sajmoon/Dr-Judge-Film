If you are looking for deep insight into the world of teen angst or how
peer pressure can make you feel even more depressed. Well then this
movie is not for you conservative stiffs. This movie is one of the best
comedies I have ever seen, I watch this movie at least 3-4 times a
year...That is a lot for me since football season runs August till
February and then the 3 months of NFL Europe. The only thing I didn't
like is Michigan State does not have a Lacrosse team, he could of said
he wanted to walk on at Sewercuse or Maryland. We were introduced to
Sean Scott and everyman between the age of 21-38 who likes beer and
woman has a new anti pc guy we all can relate to. If you can't laugh at
this movie rush to the hospital quick and get that stick pulled out of
your anus.
