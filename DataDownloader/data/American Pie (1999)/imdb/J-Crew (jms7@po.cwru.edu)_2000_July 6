For a comedy to work, the characters in it must either be very sympathetic
or very unsympathetic, with little space between.  This film chronicles a
couple months in the lives of four likable high school seniors, desperate to
experience sex before finishing high school.  The lack of originality in the
idea is more than compensated for with loads of humor, a truly appealing
cast, and an unexpected sweetness amid all the vulgarity.  Funny, witty, and
certain to contain many future stars.
