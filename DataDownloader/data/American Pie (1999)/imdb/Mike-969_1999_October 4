<br /><br />American Pie is sheer brilliance.  This movie truly captures the essence
of
the American high school male.  Contrary to what other commentators have
noted, every high school male has one primary objective: to get laid.
This
movie definitely captures the angst associated with that quest.<br /><br />This movie is beyond funny. Although many have compared it to Porky's, it
has taken this genre to a new level. Let's hope with see more of this high
quality film making.
