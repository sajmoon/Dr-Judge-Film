I enjoyed American Pie.  Of course I am a Porky's fan as well.  This movie
kept me laughing all the way through.  I had heard about it and decided to
buy the film.  My mom and stepdad watched it while I was away and said I
had
to watch it.  We couldn't stop laughing.  If you are drunk it is even
funnier.  Of course it isn't something I would let my children watch and my
mom and stepdad will not let my stepbrother watch it yet.  It is a very
good
comedy.  The cast does a wonderful job of being sickly funny.  If you are a
Porky's fan this movie is a must see but even if you aren't I still
recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor.
