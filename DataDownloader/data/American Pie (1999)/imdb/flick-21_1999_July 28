This movie is definitly one of a kind, I have never seen anything like it.
It is totally daring and entertaining. I loved the whole plot concerning
four highschool guys who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.
It's such a simple movie but their is so much reality mixed in with humor
that you can not deny that it is one of the funniest this summer.
