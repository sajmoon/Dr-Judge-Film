I think it's terrible how people seem to be easily offended by this movie.
There's much more to this movie then a bunch of X rated humor.  If people
could get past the strong sexuality, strong language, and teen alcohol use,
I think they could find there's much more to it then the critics say there
is.  Point is, I'm a big fan of romantic comedies, and I do think there is
romance in this movie that you can't get if you saw it in the theatre and
walked out within the first twenty minutes.  Fact is, some of the boys, even
though they think they're looking for quick sex, actually end up falling in
love and feeling real emotions for their dates.  Also, as a high school
student, I think it does have some great commentary on the teenaged sex
life, however I do feel sorry for anybody who relates to it too much.  Happy
viewing, and if any easily offended conservatives intend to watch this, I
beg you to watch the whole thing, otherwise, you won't understand it one
bit.
