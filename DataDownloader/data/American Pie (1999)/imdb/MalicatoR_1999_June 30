American pie was hilarious and a must-see for any teenage age guy.  I am
not
too sure if there is anymore room left on that proverbial envelope to push
after this flick.  Although many teenage sexual urges and problems were
exaggerated, the writers kept close to the adolescent experience.  I could
relate to some of the characters, which made it all the more funny and
captivating.  I'll have to see this again in the theater, but I might
hesitate to see it on a date...especially a first.
