Going to see American Pie, I was thinking of all the funny trailers on TV,
and was looking forward to a good time.  But the movie exceeded all my
expectations, as not only was this a comedy, it was one to which almost
anyone could relate, and see themselves in one of the film's characters.
There are several unforgettable scenes, which will no doubt become
classics,
but the main objective of the movie, along with providing gut-busting
laughs, is to present a message that one is free to make his own decisions
and to disregard peer pressure.  I'm not going to spoil the movie for those
who have not seen it yet, because some of the jokes are funny only when
seen
for the first time, but the jist of it is: YOU HAVE TO SEE AMERICAN PIE if
you like to laugh and are any kind of movie buff.  It's also a great film
to
bring a date to.
