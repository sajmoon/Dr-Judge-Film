I&#39;m not sure why I rated this movie a 9 instead of 10 as it had me
laughing from the opening moment to the last scene. The characters are
perfectly cast, each with separate, distinct personalities reminiscent
of some stereotype we all knew in High School. This film was written
with a sensitive understanding what it is like to be in your later
adolescent years and still exploring sex for the first moments. Clever,
original, laugh out loud funny to a point you hate to see this great
comedy end. Comedies are the most difficult of genre to do really well,
but this one hits the mark. I sat there and enjoyed reliving a few
moments of my own as I watched this great film. Worth enjoying for more
than a single viewing.
