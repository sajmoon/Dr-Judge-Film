You will NOT see a funnier movie this year! American Pie delivers all you
could want in a teen comedy. But its not just a teen comedy. Even though
adults might be repulsed by the crudeness and sexual nature of the film,
they're guaranteed to crack a smile. The plot alone lets the viewer know
that the film will be funny. When four boys make a pact to lose their
virginity before prom night, you know that many things can go right and
some
things can go SERIOUSLY wrong. So if you watch this movie, and follow the
stories of Jim, Finch, Kevin and (Oz?), you'll roll over in your seat
laughing!
