what a great movie!! i have no words to describe how much this movie
influenced my life... it's pretty real, pretty damn good.
Congratulations for everyone who made this eternal and perfect movie...
the first time i saw this movie...oh Jesus!! well when i saw this movie
for the first time i laugh and laugh.. like i never had laugh before!
the scenes are such damn good and at the same time realistic, the cast
was fantastic, specially Jason Biggs with a gorgeous work (when he is
eating the aple pie) LOLOL i know that a lot of people don't give
American pie the value that it deserves but this movie broke somme
teenage problems like sex and others stuff... well it's so good,
congratulations!! <br /><br />well stay cool! ;)
