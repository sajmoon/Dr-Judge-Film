1999_October 8 

How can a film be tasteful and yet distasteful at the same time? I don't
know, but this film manages it while bringing together all the crude
jokes,
all the familiar one-liners and site gags alongside a familiar story-line
that the viewer doesn't tire of.
I think by now that most people whether they've seen the film or not
will know of at least some of the films many, many, many funny moments, so
I'll simply say that if you can see this film with a broad mind no
preconceived ideas you will rewarded with an entertaining night
out.
