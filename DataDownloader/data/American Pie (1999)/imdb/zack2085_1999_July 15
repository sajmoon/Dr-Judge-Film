1999_July 15 

I knew that &quot;American Pie&quot; would be a classic teen movie ever since I saw
the trailers in the movie theatres, and as it turns out, I was very, VERY
right. Every one of the cast members did a great job, especially Michelle
(Alyson Hannigan) who stood out in every scene and still couldn't find
anything else to talk about except band camp.<br /><br />This movie does have some very gross gags, including masturbation and
other
sexual situations, but they are all very funny. This is a great movie, so
check it out while you can!
