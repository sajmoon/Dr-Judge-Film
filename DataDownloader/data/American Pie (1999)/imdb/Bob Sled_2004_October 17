Well Amercian Pie will probably be remembered as the best teen movie of
the 90's. This movie introduced the world to Jason Biggs (Jim), Shannon
Elizabeth (Nadia, the foreign exchange student), Sean William Scott
(Stifler), and Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad). <br /><br />Eugene Levy is the dad that every son wished he had. Eugene steals
every scene he is in and is just so lovable. Jim(Biggs) is like just
about every teenage boy, he just wants to get laid, but some of the
things he does are unlike every teenage boy, I won't spoil it for those
of you that haven't seen it but it's extreme. Stiffler is the
instigator of everything and as guys know there's one Stifler in every
group of friends. Nadia is the hot foreign exchange student who Jim
wants and she is willing to let Jim have her..but is Jim up to the
task? At one point they are in a situation, that every teenage boy has
imagined himself being in, in Jim's room.<br /><br />This movie is hilarious and goes to extremes for laughs. John Cho also
makes himself known in this film as one of the MILF guys. American Pie
is one of the greatest teen comedies ever made.
