THIS FILM changed my life!!!!! I come home everyday and throw on
American pie and it never fails to make me feel great. In terms of
film-making there is nothing to fault, fantastic acting, a hilarious
script and inspired direction all add up to the greatest film ever
brought down to earth from heaven. It truly is god&#39;s gift to serious
movie-goers, such as myself, finally a film that does not talk down to
individuals. I seriously think this film should be shown on a large
screen in any country with social or political unrest and the light
hearted comedy would really sort everyone out. I&#39;m watching American
pie on my telly as I write this thanking god that I have the absolute
pleasure to be alive at the same time as such a masterpiece of
film-making. It truly deserved its thirteen Oscar nominations as well
as its prestigious &quot;film of the millennium&quot; awarded by the UN. Go watch
it now and feel yourself grow as a person!!!!!
