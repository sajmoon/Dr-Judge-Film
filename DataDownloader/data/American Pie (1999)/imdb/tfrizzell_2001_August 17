The 1980s ran rampant with two types of genres: the slasher flick and the
teen flick. Of course both genres are just plain awful with very few
exceptions across the board. &quot;American Pie&quot; feels like 1984 all over again.
This is a mildly amusing film that is fueled by sexual tension and ignorance
as four young men (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas
Ian Nicholas) vow to lose their virginity before graduating high school. The
target date: prom night (big surprise). What follows are gross-out jokes
aplenty with silly situations and crazy outcomes abound. While &quot;American
Pie&quot; is not a very good film, it does try to send messages about youth, sex,
and love, but ultimately falls flat on its face. This film also launched the
careers of many of its performers (Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Seann
William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Alyson Hannigan), but as with
this film their credits are unimpressive to say the least. Eugene Levy is
good as Biggs' clueless father, but the youths rule this film and that is
not necessarily a good thing. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
