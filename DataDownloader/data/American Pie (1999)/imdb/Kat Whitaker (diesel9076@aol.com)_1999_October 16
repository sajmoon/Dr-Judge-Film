1999_October 16 

This film is just too good. 
                                                              The actors are
well chosen they all suit there characters and are believable that you just
get totally sucked into the movie, and Alyson Hannigan(who's from one of my
all time fave programmes) is just absolutely hysterical even though she is
only in it for about twenty odd minutes.
                                                              If you loved
Something About Mary you are REALLY gonna love this film.
