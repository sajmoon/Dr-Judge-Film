1999_December 24 

Let's be brutally honest folks..teenage boys want to get
laid,first and foremost.
This movie captures the reckless abandon i myself and so
many other friends have experienced.
Sure some of the humor was gross and juvenile..But it's a
teen comedy not CNN Worldview.
Comparisons to &quot;Porkys&quot; are misleading as this movie is
actually funny and modern while Porkys,imho, was boring
and excruciatingly tedious.
If you aren't easily offended and can laugh at life and
aren't expected a Shakespearian effort (and 
realistically.who would?) than this movie will please you.<br /><br />
