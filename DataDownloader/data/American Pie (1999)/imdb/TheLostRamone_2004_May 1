I would like to say that American Pie is a load of cliched teen movie
storylines from the eighties resurrected for the 90's. This film is not
only
AWFUL but BORING. Anyone who is anyone knows how its going to end the sex
scenes are also over exagerated and the swearing (which is put in their to
make the film &quot;COOL&quot;) gets so annoying I would rather watch a monkey pick
bugs from another monkeys back and eat it for 80 minutes rather than watch
this trash.
P.S. I bought this film and was rather disapointed after wasting my
money
like that. Think of what my friends say when they see that on my shelf
with
my &quot;DESCENT&quot; film collection.<br /><br />* out of *****
