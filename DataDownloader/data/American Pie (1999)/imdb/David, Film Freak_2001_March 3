Teen movies come and go... but this won't be forgotten! This brassy film is
in a league of it's own and the only other movie that could compare to the
gross-ness in a teen film, would be 'Cruel Intentions' - and that has two
girls kissing, and two guys having sex...<br /><br />The story is about 4 high-school seniors (among those are 'Loser' star Jason
'Pie-guy' Biggs, child-star Thomas Ian Nicholas and Chris Klein from 'Here
On Earth') who bet eachother that they will have sex before the end of
school.<br /><br />Main guy Jim (Biggs) lusts over hot exchange student Nadia ('Scary Movie's
Shannon Elizabeth), and even strips for him... another, Kevin, (Nicholas)
tries to further his relationship with long-time girlfriend Vicki (Tara
Reid, star of 'Urban Legend'), while Oz, (Klein) joins the chior in hopes of
getting closer to Heather, (Mena Suvari who worked with fellow 'Pie' star
Jason Biggs in 'Loser').<br /><br />Alyson Hannigan, from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' stars here, as one of the
films most memorable characters, Michelle (&quot;there was this one time, at band
camp...&quot;) - a loser who plays the flute. Natasha Lyonne ('The Slums Of
Beverly Hills) is also among the teen cast, as is Seann W. Scott (from 'Road
Trip).<br /><br />This film boldy goes where no other film has gone (and I'm not talking about
the pie!) and it's hilarious nature, makes this movie a must-see for anyone
over the age of 13!!
