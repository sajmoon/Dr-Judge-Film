American Pie (and the whole trend of high-school comedies it started) can be
described best Farrelly bros. comedy for adolescents. A constant barrage of
vulgarity and cheap sex-jokes without an actual story to tell. American Pie
introduces four desperately horny young men who make a pact. Before their
graduation, they have to lose their virginity no matter what! To obtain this
goal they're willing to go through all possible forms of public humiliations
and mockery. Throughout the whole film, it is exclusively the male teenager
who's portrayed as a filthy-minded creature. The girls in American Pie are
sensitive, intelligent and generally considered to be the superior species,
which is a pretty fresh and satisfying point of view. The films contains a
few sequences that are notorious already&#133;such as the `bakery-masturbation'-scene
and &#150; oh yes &#150; the magnificent striptease by the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth&#133;<br /><br />American Pie is lamebrain entertainment in its purest form. The acting is
overall good, with some new fresh faces as well as some veteran actors
(Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's dad). The jokes work, the screenplay
contains some fun, memorable quotes (`It's not a space shuttle launch, it's
SEX') and the creators DO know their classics! Just look at the terrific
reference to `The Graduate' near the end of the film. You can easily skip
both sequels though&#133;more from the same, only worse. American Pie became a
huge success and one of the biggest box office hits of the late nineties;
while modest, intelligent little films from that same period are being
catapulted straight into Oblivion. Cinema may not always be fair, but
American Pie sure is fun!
