I never saw fun-movies like Something about Mary, or Austin Powers, before.
But this one really encouraged me to seek for some of them.<br /><br />I watched it at the cinema, and it was really very rude, but yet it wasn't
insulting. That meant that it was just like I could recognize my friends
with whom I can talk freely about things like sex and virginity. It was just
very exciting. Especially the last confession from the
girl-in-the-orchestra-with-the-flute... That made me, and even my
girlfriend, rolling on the floor..
