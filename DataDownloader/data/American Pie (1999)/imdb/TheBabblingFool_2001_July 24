Why did they make this movie? It's not funny. They just wrote some really
unbelievable (and unfunny) story, crammed it full of bad over actors.
Jason
Biggs is about the most horrible pathetic actor out of all the movies I
have
watched, he makes me want to vomit. None of the girls who are supposed to
be
hot are hot, not even Shannon Elizabeth nude could save this film. A guy
&quot;making love&quot; to a pie is neither believable or funny, and definitely not
shocking when it's being done by horrible actors, trying to be funny. The
fact that this movie was successful and they are making a sequel makes me
want to go postal on Hollywood, and american movie audiences. The only
positive thing I can say about this film is that Blink-182 has a cameo in
it. If you want a REAL &quot;shock&quot; comedy, watch a much better, 20 times
funnier, 1999 flick South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut. Avoid this rancid
pile of feces at all costs.<br /><br />I give it a -10 out of 10
