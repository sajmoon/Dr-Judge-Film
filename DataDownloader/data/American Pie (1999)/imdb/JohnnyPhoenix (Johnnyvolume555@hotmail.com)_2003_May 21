American Pie<br /><br />Rated: UR	Runtime: 96mins	Release Date: 1999<br /><br /> For four teenage boys, the two hardest things to accomplish in life are
figuring out what to do at the end of High School and losing their
virginity.<br /><br /> American Pie tells the hilarious story of four typical American teenagers
that are working their way to graduating high school, and trying to make it
to &quot;home plate&quot; at the same time. Yet for these four individuals, nothing
comes easy and they'll learn that to get what they want in life, whether it
is love, happiness, or the chance to score, they'll have to work for
it.<br /><br /> Made in the same vein as Porky's, only done much better, American Pie is a
great coming of age comedy that, unlike Porky's, has a cast of bright, young
Hollywood stars that can actually act. Every character is different, from
the insecure Jim (Jason Biggs), to the wild and Zany Stiffler (a scene
stealing Sean William Scott), as well each one has his own place in the
film. The female characters in this film, although not as evident as the
male leads but still just as much a part of the story, are also really well
played out and diversified, including foreign exchange student Nadia (the
beautiful Shannon Elizabeth), and the bright, yet shy, Heather (the up and
coming Mena Suvari). Also thrown in to the mix is Eugene Levy in his most
hilarious film role to date, as Jim's &quot;understanding&quot; father. On a personal
note I really believe Levy to be a comedic genius and I really hope
Hollywood keeps using him and giving him the credit he
deserves.<br /><br /> Pie director Paul Weitz pulls of a surprising gem of a comedy that would
make even the most uptight of people laugh at least once. Weitz brilliantly
tells this coming of age story using gross out humor and a lot of vulgarity,
but never strays off the emotional path that he's tying to create not only
for his characters, but as well for anyone who has ever been a teenager. The
movie has a great high school days feel, and some of the sight gags
including the unrated &quot;pie&quot; scene are truly hilarious and as grown men I
don't know how they came up with some of these ideas. Writer Adam Herz is a
true comedic talent, and I find he really demonstrates his craft in this
film. Evidence towards this point include a line about using a flute as
something other than a musical instrument. But for the younger readers out
there I really can't go in to that, so you'll just have to see for yourself.
The production team of Warren Zide, Craig Perry, Chris Moore, and Chris
Weitz, really took a gamble on this movie, but I believe and judging by box
office results, that it paid them back ten fold.<br /><br /> If you want to make a movie that really is one of the best comedies to be
released in the past few years this is how you would go about doing it. The
film boasts a great cast, genuine humor and is filled with emotion. Throw in
some beautiful women for eye candy, and a solid director who believes in the
material he's working with, and you have yourself the ingredients for one
great American Pie. <br /><br />Overall Rating: 8 out of 10<br /><br />
