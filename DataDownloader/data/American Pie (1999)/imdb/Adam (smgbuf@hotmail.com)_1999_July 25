It has it's shock value and it's laughs. It is a lesser version of Porky's.
If you like sex talk, brief nudity, and a lot of gross out scenes, see this.
It has it's downfalls ( Nadia and the bedroom ) and it's lesser humorous
moments. i'm a Buffy fan so personally Alyson Hannigan's small role was the
best. Also Chris Klein went to my school in Omaha and so I thought I'd see
it to support him getting out of this god-awful city. Anyways, if yo're
perverse or need a movie to see with friends, you could do a lot worse (
Wild wild West.)
