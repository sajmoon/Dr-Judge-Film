2004_January 9 

this movie is an extraordinary piece of comic genius! you start watching
this movie, having seen the trailers and read the summary on the back of
what its about, and you think 'yep......i have a good idea of the kind of
movie this is going to be'. then you watch it and your blown away by the
sexual references that this movie gets away with, and you cant stop laughing
cos never in your wildest dreams could u sit and watch this extremely rude
film with your grandparents. there are points in this movie when you sit and
cringe cos of what is happening to the on-screen characters. this movie is
unimaginable, and is so unrealistic, but who cares when its so amazingly
funny?!
