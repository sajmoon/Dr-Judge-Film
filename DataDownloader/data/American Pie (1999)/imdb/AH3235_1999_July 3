1999_July 3 

this is one of the few films I've seen all year where I have consistently
laughed out loud and applauded. The only film I've seen where the whole
audience applauded at the end (and not because they were glad it was over).
There's nothing new here as far as story goes but the gags and delivery of
jokes are priceless!
