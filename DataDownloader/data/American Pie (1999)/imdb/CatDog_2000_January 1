This movie is somewhat gross, but it's funny!  I think it accurately
portrays what happens in a teen's sex life.  I liked the character Jim,
though...although he gets caught several times his dad was really cool about
it, which was the funniest part of the movie.  I also liked the fact that
Blink-182 made an appearance, too.  I recommend this movie to everyone over
15.
