This is basically the reason that most mainstream comedies nowadays are
so dumbed down. Sure, similar styles had been done before but this is
what set off the alarm clock for all the atrocities to come.<br /><br />What exactly wrong with this movie? The whole &#x27;comedy&#x27; part is based
upon sexual references, sexual references, obscenity, and more sexual
references. Ha ha! Hilarious right? Well no. There isn&#x27;t much comedy in
a random girl masturbating in the main character&#x27;s room for no reason
and then him prematurely ejaculating twice. There isn&#x27;t any hilarity in
being caught by your parents which jacking off. The supposedly &#x27;funny&#x27;
parts are completely bland and done in a very tasteless fashion. I
don&#x27;t think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. Hell, I probably
found even Swing Vote more funny, a movie that didn&#x27;t even emphasize on
the comedic aspect all that much.<br /><br />And now thanks to this piece of crud, thousands of movie makers are
convinced that you need tons of swear words, lots of sex references,
obscenity and perhaps even more sex references to make a movie funny.
Plus, most kids think I&#x27;m talking about this crap when I mention the
song of the same name. Thanks a lot American Pie.
