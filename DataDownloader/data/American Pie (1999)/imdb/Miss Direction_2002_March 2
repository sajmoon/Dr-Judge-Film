As if teens who choose abstinence don't need to be ostracized any further,
there's this lovely sack of crap to alienate them even further.  I had the
privilege of seeing the unrated version.  I didn't find the movie's
content
in and of itself offensive, it's just that it has a terrible message (&quot;you
must lose your virginity as soon as possible, even if you're a teenager&quot;)
and isn't even that funny.  Guy has violent diarrhea after so-called
&quot;friend&quot; slips him some laxative.  Guy drinks beer with semen in it.  Guy
prematurely ejaculates when he's about to have sex with his dream girl.
People use various objects for sexual gratification.  Oh, stop, or I'll
just
DIE laughing!<br /><br />God help the people who produced this assualt upon the reputation of the
art
of film, because He obviously did not bless those poor souls with good
judgment.  No wonder Hollywood is thought of as a great cesspool of horror
and depravity--because it IS a great cesspool of horror and
depravity!<br /><br />I can't wait to see American Pie 3: They All Get Genital Warts.  (How hard
will it be for them to get laid when their nether regions look like relief
maps of the Andes?)
