this is by far one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.  A lot of
older
more &quot;mature&quot; people claim that this movie is crude and unfunny. Well
i'll
tell you this i'm willing to bet that if they even bothered to sit down
and
watch this hopelessly hilarious film they were probably laughing. I mean
Seann William Scott and Jason Biggs made this film so funny. so, if you
havent seen this movie, i suggest that you take the time to watch
it.
