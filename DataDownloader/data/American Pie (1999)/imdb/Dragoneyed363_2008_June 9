I thought American Pie was a good little movie that would be nice to
own on DVD.Let me start off by saying it wasn&#39;t completely hilarious,
and it wasn&#39;t unbelievably bad, but it&#39;s not anything great either, and
should never be called as so.Most of the material is unnecessary, and
just flat out stupid, but then again, most comedies have to have some
of the material such as that.The acting was great though, I was
actually expecting bad, but they surprised me by throwing in witty
conversations, and good acting parts.I recommend this movie to comedy
lovers, for even though it&#39;s definitely not a classic, it is a must
see, if you have no limitations as to what you like in a film.
