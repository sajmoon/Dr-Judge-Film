This is my review on American pie. This movie is a great comedy
classic. It starts the birth of all teen and raunchy comedies. It has
great comedic moments and hilarious actors and writing.<br /><br />The story line to this movie is very simple and straight forward. 4
friends who are in high school and still are virgins make a packed that
they will all lose their virginity by prom night. Of course a bunch of
wild antics ensue that keeps the audience laughing.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie then you are not a fan of comedies nor
movies. This movie has been out forever and is an instant classic. Good
acting funny jokes, and partial nudity it will for sure keep you
entertained.
