Subtle? No.
Mindless? Sometimes.
Bad Taste? Probably.
Toilet Humour? Yes.
Sexual? Yes.
Funny? You bet!<br /><br />One could compare this movie with Porky's. Only....American Pie is much
more
fun! Okay, this movie is not very intellectual but at least it brings
unpretentious humour.
I find it strange however, that this movie is R-rated in the US, while
over
here it is approved for all audience.
True: it is all about sex, and there are a couple of nice breasts to
see...but at no time this movie is shocking.
Some of the jokes are a bit too mindless or just dull, but the movie never
slows down and there are plenty hilarious situations.
Highly recommendable.
