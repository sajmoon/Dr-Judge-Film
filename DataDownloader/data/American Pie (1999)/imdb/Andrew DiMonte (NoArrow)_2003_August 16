...&quot;American Pie&quot; is the kind of movie for that kid in third grade who'd
shout out &quot;Sex!&quot; because he thought the word was funny.  Honestly, every
joke in this movie is just a slightly different variation of shouting out
&quot;Sex!&quot;.  Please, I don't call that funny, I call it elementary.<br /><br />The story focuses on Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a bunch of teens who all vow to
lose their virginity by prom night.  They do this because Chuck Sherman
(Chris Owen), an annoying loser, claims he lost his virginity before them. 
Unfortunately it is so obvious that Chuck is lying that anyone who was
actually surprised by this near the end wasn't paying attention.  Of course,
it's hard to pay attention to a movie like this.<br /><br />The only thing worse than the movie though was the acclaim it got.  A few
years after it first came out I heard my friends (I use that term loosely)
making the same vow.  Unfortunately, these kids were thirteen.  If &quot;American
Pie&quot; is inspiring pre-teens to impregnate other pre-teens, and is famous for
it, well,  that shows you what kind of world we're living
in.<br /><br />If you have any substance to your character than please, stay away,
4/10.
