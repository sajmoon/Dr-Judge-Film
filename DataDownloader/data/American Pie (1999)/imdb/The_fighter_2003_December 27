Yet another movie takes a sick advantage by playing on teen hormones. Not
only do movies about sexual behavior lead to such behavior, some (like
this)
are, for some reason, not considered outright porn!<br /><br />The humor? Call ME sick, but I don't find humor in young teenagers
searching
for someone to aid them in their lust for lost virginity.<br /><br />I Rate This: 0 (Also the number of times I laughed during this
movie)
