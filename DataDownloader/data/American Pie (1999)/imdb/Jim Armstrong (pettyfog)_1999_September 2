1999_September 2 

There have been several comments by older folks here about the quality of
this flick and I'll whole-heartedly add my 50-ish kudos.<br /><br />This was ALSO the way it was in the sixties - some folks conveniently seem
to forget this:  The sexual revolution started in high school.<br /><br />I expected to see something along the lines of the embarrassingly
exploitive
&quot;Porky's&quot; or unfocused as &quot;Ridgemont..&quot; or even too much of the
existentialism of &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;.
Think of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; from a different angle. With as much fun as
&quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;<br /><br />What we found was that ALL the characters in the movie were
multi-dimensional even the girls who usually suffer from the cardboard
sex-object treatment in these things.<br /><br />Anyone that doesnt think this movie is representational and
realistic -yes,
even the gross-outs- is suffering from denial or delusions. .. And sorry
to
tell you kids, you didnt invent this sexual angst.<br /><br />As say the rest.. dont see it with a stranger but with a good friend,
you'll
leave laughing.<br /><br />Why, &quot;One time... at Band Camp......&quot;
