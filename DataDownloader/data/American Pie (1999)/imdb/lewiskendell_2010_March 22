American Pie probably needs another review less than almost any movie
in the world. Is there anyone left who hasn&#x27;t already seen the movie,
or at least knows what it&#x27;s about? Regardless, here are my two cents.&#xA0;<br /><br />American Pie hasn&#x27;t aged particularly well. It doesn&#x27;t have the
timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy
genre, and it&#x27;s been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after
it. It&#x27;s still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that
used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today&#x27;s standards. The
most enjoyment I get from the movie now, is from looking at the
substantial cast and seeing how their careers have changed, remained
stagnant, or basically ended all-together, since 1999. There aren&#x27;t
many other reasons to go back to American Pie. &#xA0;
