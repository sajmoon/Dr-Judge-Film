Abundant nudity (in almost all the right places), facetious hormones,
fragrant sexual humor and losing your virginity (squeezing it in after
graduation, mind you) isn&#x27;t material for a well-to-nigh bash, but as a
flash mob experience it&#x27;s extremely funny, has a congenial tone and the
climax isn&#x27;t as sticky as what preceded it. More traditional than most
Porky-style comedies, it&#x27;s almost telling relationships and sex like
the golden rule except without the bride price. It looks like some of
the characters are into their relationships for the meaning and maybe
the long haul. Anything may go in the world and even if American Pie is
clandestine about it all, something conversely positive is being said
for monogamy and love after-all.
