How can you make a film that holds no plot. Theres no storyline to this its
just a feature length ramble of what teens are seen as through the directors
eyes. Its also not very original either, The best ever teen movie was &quot;The
breakfast club&quot; which was very funny and had some kind of plot. It never
made you think what someone else says you should think either and most
importantly of all American pie isn't hilarious at all. The jokes are all
reruns from other films but just done by idiot teens and there pathetic
stereotypical lives.
