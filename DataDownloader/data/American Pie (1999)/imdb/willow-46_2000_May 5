2000_May 5 

I rented this video out of curiosity ,and for Alyson, too. Anyway, my
friends thought it was good. I read those reviews on this movie and I
thought,&quot;Sounds cool!&quot; Only that I wasn't 16 yet. So I waited for the video.
It's generally good, some really gross-out scenes and weird and wonderful
ideas(I'm referring to the pie scene...)But I didn't pay too much attention
to the characters( except Michelle, maybe) because too bad I rented it along
with The Matrix and saw it the morning after, when I was still in the shadow
of T M's glory. This is not the kind of movie your parents would like, so
avoid watching it with them. One piece of great advice we got from the
movie: always lock the door!!
