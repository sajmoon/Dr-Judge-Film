2000_December 17 

I am a fifteen year old male,and this is my favorite
movie.Surprise,surprise.I
have seen it over 20 times own both versions(rated and unrated)on DVD.The
main reason this is my favorite movie is the scenes betwwen Jim(Jason
Biggs),and his dad(Eugene levy).These scenes are nothing less than
hilarious,and made me laugh so hard I thought I was going to puke!Those
are
the best scenes,but not the only very funny ones.Everything in this movie
is
funny.It is crude,but not as crude as I thought it would be.It is been
called the &quot;Porky's for the 90's&quot;,but I think it is much better than
that.Not for everyone,but for guys like me.
