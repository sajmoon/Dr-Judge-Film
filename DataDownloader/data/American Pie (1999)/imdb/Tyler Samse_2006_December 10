American Pie is land mark in teen comedy history. It was a terrific
movie with tons of humor and a good plot that kept you laughing
throughout the entire film. It tells the tale of four young men in high
school who make a pact to lose their virginities by prom. The movie
centers around Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch. It follows their experiences
and exploits, their trials and errors, and their triumphs and their
miserable, humiliating failures. And we can&#39;t forget Stifler, enough
said. This comedy is an instant classic with it&#39;s terrific toilet humor
and amazingly funny potty jokes, from uncontrollable bowel movements in
the girls&#39; bathroom, to premature explosions in the pants, to drinking
a pale ale, this movie&#39;s got it all. So, if you haven&#39;t seen it, go out
to the nearest video store and rent it today.
