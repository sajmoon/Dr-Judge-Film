I just watched *American Pie*, the much-talked about blockbuster hit of the
summer of '99, the year that many, many far superior movies came
out.<br /><br />The Matrix. eXistenZ. Run Lola Run. The Blair Witch Project. Three Kings.
American Beauty. Go. And those are just some of the ones I've
*seen*.<br /><br />Highlights of *American Pie* include the presence of Alyson Hannigan,
Natasha Lyonne, and Tara Reid having an orgasm. And scattered amusing
scenes, and a couple good lines.<br /><br />But it's really not that funny, unless you find it funny. Sex can be funny,
yes. *Sex and the City*, *Election*, and countless others have proved that
sex can be done very humorously to affect me. I'm not going to try to
analyze what they do, but I do know what *American Pie* does: It assumes
that anything involving sex is inherently funny. A guy screwing an apple
pie? Okay, kind of amusing, but the scene's a huge letdown since you
basically see everything you could possibly see in the trailer. It's like
the *Scary Movie* philosophy: People having sex is funny.<br /><br />And then there's the scene where the stereotypical jerk spikes the oddball's
mochaccino with laxatives. Okay, now how many freaking times have I seen
someone's drink spiked with laxatives for comic effect? I think I've lost
count. It may have been a bit funny the first time, but it's not now, and we
definitely don't need to see anyone on a toilet with repulsive sound
effects. Is this the best Adam Herz could do? Perhaps my idea of clever is
different from everyone else's.<br /><br />So *American Pie* didn't suck, per se. It had its moments, and I laughed
more at it than I laughed at *Big Momma's House* (I think that made me
laugh...twice), although I'm sure the filmmakers thought I would laugh
more.
