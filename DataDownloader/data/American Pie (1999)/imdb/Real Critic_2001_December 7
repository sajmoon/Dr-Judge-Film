The humor was daring and outrageous, it was clear that they weren't afraid
to push it to the limit. The funniest thing about it was that no matter how
extreme the gags got, they seemed realistic because the cast was so
likable.
The movie isn't mean either which makes it better than most teen comedies.
3/4
