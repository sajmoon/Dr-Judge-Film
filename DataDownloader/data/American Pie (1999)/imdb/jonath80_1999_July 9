American Pie is the absolute funniest movie to hit the screen since
Kingpin,
and is certainly the top high school comedy of all time.  The performances
were solid all around and the screenplay was fabulous.  Herz, as well as
Outside the Box scribes Jonathan Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, will
likely
be the big names in film comedy for the next 20 years.  This film will be
a
blockbuster.
