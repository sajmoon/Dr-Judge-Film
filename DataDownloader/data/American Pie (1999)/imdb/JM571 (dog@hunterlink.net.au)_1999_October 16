1999_October 16 

Well, I thought this movie was going to be one of those puerile farces
where
getting laid is the Holy Grail that all of the characters aspire to.
Leaving the cinema, I was pleased that some of the characters had a bit of
depth - in particular, Oz, the jock who joins the choir to plumb its
resources, only to fall in love and become truly sensitive.  I also loved
the character of Finch.  I kept thinking that the actor who played him,
Eddie Kaye Thomas , reminds me of a cross between a young Nicholas Cage and
Steve Buscemi.  One to watch out for in future projects?  I also admired
the
fact that condoms were given a large amount of screen time, showing how
important they are in today's society.
Funny?  Yes.  Farcical?  No.
