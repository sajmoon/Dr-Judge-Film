Wow, things have really changed since the &quot;Getting Laid&quot; movies of my
generation.  Movies like &quot;Porky's&quot; and &quot;Losing It&quot; focus on the silly
stuff
that occurs when boys are trying to get laid.  &quot;Fast Times and Ridgemont
High&quot; showed the girl's point of view.   With this movie, you get all
that,
along with (omigosh) actual relationships!<br /><br />Obviously the taboo of showing semen in a movie has been broken forever
(thanks to &quot;Mary&quot;).  But in spite of that, the movie has a lot of
endearing
moments, like when Jim's dad keeps giving him the birds-and-the-bees talks
and catching him in the absolute most embarrassing masturbation
situations.<br /><br />I think what makes the plot brilliant is how things turn so quickly for
these five guys (counting Sherman) in the scoring game (or is it the game
of
life?).
