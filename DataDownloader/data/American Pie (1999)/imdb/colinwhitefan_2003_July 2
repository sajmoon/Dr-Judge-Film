American Pie will go down as a classic, it maybe a little raunchy, but still
very funny if you can take it. I thought every character, well every
character that mattered was great, especially Eugene Levy and Seann William
Scott. American Pie may not be for all, but if you like a raunch comedy this
is the film for you.
