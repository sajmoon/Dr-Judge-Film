This is a refreshing teen comedy in the sea of clones (She's All That,Can't
Hardly Wait,Never Been Kissed,etc.).Of course it's shocking,but its also
hilarious.The characters are all the kinds that we see and saw in high
school.It's actually a true-based movie that's been blown up to expliciter
situations.But no matter what you think,it's impossible not to crack a
smile
or bust a vocal chord laughing.
