American Pie (1999)<br /><br />Rated R for crude sexual humour, nudity, language and sex references<br /><br />When watching such films, I tend to be critical and highly
scrutinising, however, &#39;American Pie&#39; is sort of a surprise. This is
quite a good film and does have traces of originality and quality.<br /><br />While &#39;American Pie&#39; includes your usually crude humour, pervasive
sexual references and considerable nudity, it does stop and think at
times, something that is extremely rare amongst films of this kind.<br /><br />There are some scenes of gross-out humour that will guarantee, what I
like to call a &#39;laughing spree&#39;. What makes &#39;American Pie&#39; stand out
from other dull, unfocused teenage movies, is that, apart from being
extremely funny, cleverly written and having a well-suited cast, is the
fact that it does show friendships, thoughts, differences in teenagers,
without just being focused on meaningless nudity and sex all the time.<br /><br />This is a film for pure enjoyment and humour, a film that clearly
demonstrates the thoughts of the average teenager, along with comedy,
nudity and some American Pie.<br /><br />7/10
