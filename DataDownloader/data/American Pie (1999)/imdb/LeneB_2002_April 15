American Pie is a very funny flick - and great for a real laugh. It's a
really great teen-flick and I love it. If you haven't seen it yourself you
should. It's really funny and makes you in a good mood. So forget
everything
around you for a while and watch this movie. I can't wait to see American
Pie 2... SOON... Have fun with it.
