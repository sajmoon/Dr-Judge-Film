This film is really funny from a teens point of view.
I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty
silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious
crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before
graduation.
It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was
blatant at times by some of the cast.
The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.<br /><br />Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex
scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid
thats
up to you to decide.<br /><br />The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you
crying for more.<br /><br />To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly
begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually
ruin anything.<br /><br />Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not
stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!<br /><br />Is it worth the rent??Certainly??But i recommend that if your,what?Over 25
NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand
it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...<br /><br />Is it a film you can watch over and over again?
CERTAINLY.....This film is very addictive,and no matter how many times
you've
seen it,you want to invite your friends over and watch it
again.!<br /><br />Rating of 10?
Well,it might just not be a blockbuster..!
But it definitey IS a great film that im extremely certain you'd
enjoy!<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />
