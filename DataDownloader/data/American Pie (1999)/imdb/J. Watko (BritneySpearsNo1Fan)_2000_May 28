I usually don't give into &quot;smash hit&quot; movies which nine times out of ten are
overrated.  Infact, I didn't even see this in the theaters.  Finally, upon
it's unrated DVD release, I saw it, and I must say, was surprised.  While it
is a teen sex comedy aimed primarily at horny teenagers, it does have a
rather believable story, and one helluva hilarious script.  It gets slow at
times, and not taking anything away from Mena Suvari, I feel her plotline's
scenes drag the most.  Overall it's a recommended watch.  I've now scene
both versions, and there really isn't much of a difference.  Watching
either, you'll still see the same reasons why this movie was the hit it
was.
