1999_December 23 

American Pie is probably the funniest teen movie of 1999. It made big bucks
at the box office too. I am glad they picked some fresh faced to the screen.
I think this was Jason Biggs first big screen movie. This movie would have
sucked if they picked dawson creek kids. The only WB teen star they did use
was Alyson Hannigan, she is great, they should put her in more movies.
Thomas Ian Nicholas, i recognize him from kid movies like Kid In King
Arthers Court. Im glad that he is moving on. The cast was perfect. Its good
they didnt use James Van Der Beek or Katie Holmes or Sarah Michelle
Gellar...the list goes on! I was mad they didnt show more of Natasha Lyonne.
i LOVE her!!! I liked the plot too, 4 friends making a pact to loose there
virginity by prom night. This was a funny ass movie! i watched it twice
already. i give it 4 stars out of 4, i recomend every parent and teen sees
this. if u r under the age of 13, i would tell your parents not to let you
watch this because it has very bad language, nudity, sex scenes, and some
information you little kids dont need to know yet!
