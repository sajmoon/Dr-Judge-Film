This movie sucks. Just look at the look on Jason biggs face when
Shannon Elizabeth is next to him in bed. He&#39;s like afraid of her.
Afraid of a woman. What an f&#39;in loser. You&#39;re supposed to love women,
and appreciate them, not be afraid of them. What kind of message is
that teaching the youth. Men are supposed to be the head of the
household, not cowardly weaklings who are terrified of the woman.
That&#39;s just some sick feminist movement. A woman is the child bearer,
she&#39;s not supposed to have the say over the man. That&#39;s how messed up
society is today. That&#39;s why there&#39;s so many divorces, children born
out of wedlock, motherless and fatherless children... movies like this
fuel that. You should avoid this movie.
