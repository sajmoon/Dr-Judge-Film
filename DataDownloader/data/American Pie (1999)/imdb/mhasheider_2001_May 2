Funny and a very lovable comedy where four guys: Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) strike
a deal that they'll try to let go of their virginities before the end of the
school year.  Kudos to director Paul Weitz and screenwriter Adam Herz for
creating a movie where the morals and humor aren't at the same depth.  The
characters in this film here are easy to understand and no one misses a
single beat.  One example would be Eugene Levy (who portrays Jim's Dad)
manages to snag a few scenes and his character is interesting,
too.
