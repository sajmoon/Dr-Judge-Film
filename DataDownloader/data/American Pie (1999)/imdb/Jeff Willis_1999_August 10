Another comment on this page credits this film for featuring romance and
real characters.  This is ridiculous.  The characters are a bunch of
cliches
and stereotypes borrowed from every other teen film ever made. There's the
jock who turns sensitive, the partying idiot, the losers from band, etc.
As
for romance; just because the score includes an acoustic guitar piece
before
two people have sex that doesn't mean the film has anything to do with
romance. When films of this nature (getting laughs at any expense of its
characters) try to get sentimental at the end they always trip over
themselves and so does this one. This movie is extremely funny, although
it
seems like this would diminish with future viewings since it relied so
heavily on shock value. And since American Pie mentioned The Graduate so
will I- anyone who enjoyed this film should check out the much more
sophisticated version that deals with some of the same themes.
