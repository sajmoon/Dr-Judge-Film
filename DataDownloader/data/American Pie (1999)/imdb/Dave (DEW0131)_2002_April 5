2002_April 5 

First, as an avid Kevin Smith fan, and after reading some of the reviews on
this tasteless, and relentlessly retarded movie; let me just say to those
who compared this movie to the likes of &quot;Clerks&quot; are right and wrong. At
least &quot;Clerks&quot; had a good point to it, and at least the grossest of the
gross was off screen. And lets face it, theres no way in hell this movie
can
compare in terms of the script and the writing capabilities of Kevin
Smith.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about this movie is that it's true: High school
students today are shallow, vacuous, and pretentious and only care about
their own social lives. They may seem to care about issues and events that
really do effect lives, but it's all a cover to appear much more
intelligent
than they really are.<br /><br />Even more unfortunate is the movie itself. I hate teen exploition
movies. All it does is take the fears and thoughts of teens on dating, and
turn into unfunny mindless jokes for cash and cheap laughs. Of course, the
people who buy into these kinds of movies laugh at jokes like &quot;Pen 15&quot;.
I'll
leave it up to you what your going to rent, but at all costs avoid this
drek.
