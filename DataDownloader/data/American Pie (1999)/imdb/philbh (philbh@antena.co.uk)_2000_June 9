I only recently saw American Pie, and was quite looking
forward to finally seeing it, so now imagine my
disappointment after buying the DVD.  Now, don't accuse me
of not being into crude comedy, but this movie just wasn't
funny.<br /><br />Ok, it had it's moments, but alas I can't remember them at
this time, but man that was another 1 and a half hours of
my life wasted along with &pound;20. I seem to have been struck
by a plague of  awful movies over the past few months, I've
probably wasted &pound;300 so far.<br /><br />The infamous pie scene was not even remotely funny.  If
it's comedy you want stay away from this one and go for
some classic Monty Python or Mel Brooks rather than this
one.<br /><br />If I had more thumbs I'd give it 4 thumbs down.
