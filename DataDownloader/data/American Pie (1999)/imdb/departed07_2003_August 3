American Pie brought raunchiness, sweet characters and a dad that
understand's his son more than any other NORMAL dad in the planet. This film
is about four guys wanting to get laid before leaving high school, so they
make a pact and somehow it works. I've seen all three films, and there's no
rank for them becuase they're all good.<br /><br />10 stars for all the american pie films.
