1999_December 1 

American Pie is a funny and alarmingly clever film that became one of the
sleeper hits of the summer of 1999.  It is a teenage T/A film, reminiscent
of those produced during the eighties featuring such superstars as Phoebe
Cates and that girl from &quot;Tomboy.&quot;  However, American Pie is well made, well
cast, and delivers exactly what it intended to do, while others of its mold,
such as the Porky's series, simply lapse into derivative slapstick and
un-funny scenes.<br /><br />I found American Pie to be very imaginative and incredibly witty, and it
depicts the lives of teenagers in a sweet light that could have easily
degenerated into some sort of &quot;Kids&quot;-esque oversexed romp.  Young adult
viewers will enjoy this film not because of its truthful story line or
dead-on performances, but rather its non-complicated gross-out comedy.  In
other words, parents don't faint when you decide to take a seat next to your
son or daughter and watch it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
