1999_July 7 

I was able to see a sneak preview for this movie and I was very glad I saw
it.  I know this movie wasn't going to be Oscar contendent for best pic
but
come on, its pure entertainment.  This movie is a the same track &quot; Theres
Something About Mary&quot; many masturbation jokes and sex jokes.  Though
nobody
can forget the hair scene, there are two scenes in this movie u wont
forget
anytime soon.  One with a beer and another with a pie.  Anyway, I enjoyed
Jason Biggs performance as the sex crazed Jim, he is the only one that
gets
caught masturbating TWICE!!!!!  Everything is this movie is funny, see it
for comedy, not for a real movie.
