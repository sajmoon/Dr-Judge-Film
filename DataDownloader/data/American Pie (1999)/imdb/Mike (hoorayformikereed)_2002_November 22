Since &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; sex comedies are all the rage in
Hollywood, so predictably, studios churn out a lot of forgettable,
too-raunchy-for-its-own-good fare like &quot;Tomcats,&quot; or &quot;Slackers.&quot;
Thankfully,
there is an exception to the rule, and that is this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most raucous movies ever made.
From
the opening scene (that demonstrates a new and innovative use for a tube
sock) to the satisfying finale (that demonstrates a new and innovative
use
for a flute) sexual innuendo is crammed into almost every scene. So, what
sets this movie apart from all the rest? The characters. Almost every
character in the movie is instantly endearing and memorable. Besting them
all is Eugene Levy, who shows off the full range of his comedic timing as
Jim's good-intentions fueled Dad.<br /><br />American Pie managed to do two things that very few sex comedies can.
Create
an interesting and funny premise, and, even more shockingly, deliver a
sequel that was even better than the original. On it's way to becoming a
classic of Animal House proportions, American Pie serves up equal dishes
of
hormones and heart. I came for the raunch, but I stayed for the
characters.
And the pie.<br /><br />(***/****)
