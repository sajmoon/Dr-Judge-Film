Four teenage boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night. That's it. No
spin, no Dawson's Creek irony and no Shakespearean undertones, which is
partly why it works so well. The rest of it is down to a screamingly funny
script with brilliant dialogue and hilarious (often gleefully tasteless)
situations, but one that also gives us believable characters while also
giving us quite a serious message and ultimately being quite touching by the
end. All the performances are top notch with Jason Biggs in particular
revelling in his character's increasingly outrageous situations from
screwing an apple pie while his dad walks to premature ejeculation while the
whole school tunes in on the Internet and his '50s styled Dad very well used
is nothing short of a creation of comic genius. From beginning to end, this
priceless gem scores all hits and no misses, but it's Alyson Hannigan, as
the geeky flute player, who with one line, steals the entire
film.
