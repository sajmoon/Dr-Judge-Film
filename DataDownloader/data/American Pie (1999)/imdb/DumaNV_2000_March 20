2000_March 20 

Except for a few moments during the film and the great comedic theft by
Alyson Hannigan &quot;and one time, at band camp&#133;&quot; this movie is a waste of time.
 It's been done so many times by so many actors that these kids come off as
cheap imitations of the kids who did this movie before them.  Almost all of
the jokes fall flat and lack the true emotion that makes comedy funny.  I
have to admit that the last 20 minutes was pretty funny, especially the
scene with Alyson (&quot;what's my name, B**ch!&quot;) and the scene with &quot;Stifler's
Mom&quot; on the pool table but the rest of the movie was predictable and lame. 
It was NOT worth the hoopla and not remotely worth of comparison to
&quot;Something About Mary.&quot;  Go rent &quot;Risky Business&quot; or &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day
Off&quot; to get some REAL teen movie laughs.
