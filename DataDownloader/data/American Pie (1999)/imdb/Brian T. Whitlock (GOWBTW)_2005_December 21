This is one of the corniest movie I&#39;ve ever seen since Porky&#39;s. Unlike
Porky&#39;s, this movie is more up-to-date. Making a pact before graduation
is usually common among high-school seniors. This was no problem for
because I didn&#39;t have to worry about something silly about all this.
Jason Biggs playing Jim really did his all when his character wants to
get a girl, but his reluctance is crippling him really bad. Shannon
Elizabeth is H.O.T. as Nadia. When she undresses in front of the
web-cam, every guy in the theater will start drooling. Natasha
Lyonne(The Slums of Beverly Hills) plays Jessica, the non-stop talking
flute player. Alyson Hannigan(The TV version of &quot;Buffy The Vampire
Slayer&quot;) got into a really raw detail when she tells about the accident
where her flute was stuck in her (AHEM!) That&#39;s graphic enough for me.
The memorable part in the pie, Jim making out with cherry pie, no
wonder food and sex is such a hot topic! HAHAHA! This movie is
unbelievable, if you like Porky&#39;s this movie is a must! Rating 3 out of
5 stars.
