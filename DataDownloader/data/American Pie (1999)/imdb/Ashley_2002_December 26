i love this movie, its hilarious, im a teenager and most teens loved this
movie and who cound't tell why? it was funny, jason biggs is hilarious, in
the first one and 2nd one, and so is Sean William Scott and the whole rest
of the cast, what im trying to say is that this is like the best teen movie
out there, 9/10 *the pie part was kinda sick and desperate but thats just
me*
