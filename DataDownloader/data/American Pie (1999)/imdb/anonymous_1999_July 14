1999_July 14 
<br /><br />Everyone's been comparing this film to &quot;Porkys&quot; (even this site), but the
difference, imo, is that this one is funny.  The characters are way more
likable and less idiotic.  I laughed pretty dang hard.  It's raunchy, yes,
but not so childish and immature (like an Adam Sandler flick).  That's why
I
was impressed and enjoyed it.  It would've been more realistic, I think,
if
some of the guys didn't end up getting some in the end... but it is a
movie,
so that doesn't matter.
