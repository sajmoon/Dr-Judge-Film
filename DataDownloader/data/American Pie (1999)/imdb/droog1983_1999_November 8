Since when has Hollywood decided to start making c***?  All these teenage
flicks, I'm sick and tired of them.  All of them, i.e. Cruel Intentions,
Cant Hardly Wait, Shes All That, and most of all American Pie.  Why do
people sell out, and try to make a quick buck by making teenage kids have
sex?  It pisses me off, and what is worst of all is that most of the
American public likes this film, why?  Because teenagers have sex.  That's
why.  The film is degrating, and should never have been made.  It's a film
for people who dont know the difference between film and ****.  If you want
to see really good films, may I reccomend you see Goodfellas, Clockwork
Orange, 2001, Taxi Driver, Godfather.  Those are great, classic films.
Watch them, and dont degrate yourself to helpless, teenage crap, such as
American Pie.
