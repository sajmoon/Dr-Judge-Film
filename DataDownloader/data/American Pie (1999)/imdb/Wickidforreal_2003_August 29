I think anyone who writes a bad review of this film must think that they
are
'above' this style of humour which the film uses.<br /><br />All I can suggest to them is that they eat a slice of 'humble pie' and
realise that being immature is actually great fun!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the landmark teen comedy of the new generation.
In
the late 70's, Animal House was the one that officially started it all.
Then, in the 80's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was the landmark teen
comedy. Then, in the late 90's, came American Pie. It took us into the
new
Millennium with two more installments which I would rate as highly as, if
not better than, the original! Now, I am looking forward to seeing what
the
landmark teen comedy of the 2000's is!<br /><br />There is a pattern that seems to have emerged... Each landmark film makes
at
least one of its cast a star. Animal House made John Belushi a cult
legend
(and Tim Matheson also to an extent), Fast Times made the film careers of
multiple actors who today are household names (Pheobe Cates, Judge
Reinhold,
Sean Penn to name but a few), and American Pie gave new found success to
Sean William Scott (and also gave Jason Biggs some star status). And that
is
just a brief overview.<br /><br />Its a true comedy gem and it will definitely go down in the film history
books with its name etched next to Animal House and Fast Times at
Ridgemont
High, among other classics.
