1999_September 2 

Yes, &quot;American Pie&quot; is a tasteless, disgusting, raunchy and obscene, but
it's also sweet and F***ING HILARIOUS!  This film has been called a
teenage
version of &quot;There's Something About Mary.&quot;  However, I feel it exceeds
&quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; simply because there were much more
individually funny moments than &quot;Mary.&quot;  Sure, the &quot;hair gel&quot; scene in
&quot;Mary&quot; made me fall out of my chair in the theatres, but those laughs were
few and far between.  In &quot;American Pie,&quot; moments like that flooded of the
screen into the back of the theatre.  The distinct difference between
&quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; is that you can be along
and still laugh hysterically at &quot;Pie,&quot; whereas with &quot;Mary,&quot; you have to
feed
off an audience's reaction to what is happening on screen.  &quot;American Pie&quot;
is the best and funniest teen film ever.  It is hilarious, sweet and so
much
fun all at once.  I will never be able to watch &quot;Buffy, The Vampire
Slayer&quot;
the same again and not think, &quot;Say My Name, B****!&quot;  Those who have seen
the
movie already know what I am talking about.
