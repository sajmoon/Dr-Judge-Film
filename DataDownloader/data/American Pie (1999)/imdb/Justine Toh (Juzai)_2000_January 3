About teenage boys, the virginity they regard as a malediction and their
rampaging hormones which get them into sticky situations (no pun
intended).
My uni friends said it was hilarious and fantastic.  Myself and five of my
other friends just stared at the screen and wished it was over.  A couple
of
my friends threatened to walk out.  This whole film was awful.  I don't
care
if that's truly the way teenage boys think, I think it was insulting,
degrading and exploitative of women, not that the female characters in the
film were any better.  Disgusting and nowhere as funny as it was
advertised
to be.  I've heard that in America burns to sensitive body parts has
eventuated because of sex-crazed teenage boys sticking stuff where it
doesn't belong.  They deserve it and all the humiliation that comes with
it.
You might say it's the cream on top.  Why don't they just pour boiling
water on themselves?  It sounds like it achieves the same
effect.
