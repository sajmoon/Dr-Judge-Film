1999_July 7 

In an age where teen comedies are often toned down in order to get the
&quot;audience friendly&quot; PG-13, it's always nice to see a raunchy R rated teen
comedy, I would have loved to see the R rated cut of &quot;Can't Hardly Wait.&quot;
This movie is hysterical in so many different levels and somehow still
manages to show a little heart.  You like these characters because they
ARE
you in high school.  The entire movie, however, is stolen by Allyson
Hannigan in her only big scene at the end.  Quite a stitch!  Gotta love
Willow.  A must see.
