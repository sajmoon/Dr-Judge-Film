Ever wanted to know why most countries associate America with
McDonald's and Wonderbra's? Movies like American Pie.<br /><br />Did I skip an era when stuff like this is supposed to be funny? Are
movie producers stooping to a level of comedy that would entertain a
caveman?<br /><br />American Pie focuses solely on sex-based jokes. No wit. No
intelligence. No hint of creativity. The audience waits for a character
to mention a genital - then we laugh.<br /><br />The only people laughing are the producers. They discovered a way to
earn millions from feeding pigeons.<br /><br />Hell, if you want to hear a sex joke, I have friends that will tell
them for free.<br /><br />I don't only want a refund on the ticket I paid to watch this movie,
but I also want the two hours of my life back that I wasted watching
it.
