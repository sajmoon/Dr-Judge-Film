I liked this.  I put off seeing it for years because i assumed (naughty
me) that it would be like Animal House or Porkeys.  That is... i assumed
it
would have nothing but contempt for women.  Shows you how much i know.<br /><br />American Pie is more like Diner than Porkeys or Animals House.  As in
Diner, the boys in American Pie gotta grow up and go beyond boy friendship
to get what their hearts truely desire. Do you remember the story about
the
Princess and the Glass Mountain?  The knight has to figure out how to go
up
a glass mountain to win the Princess's heart.<br /><br />Hey.... it's an old story and as valid today as ever it
was.<br /><br />All the actors are charming.  Eugene Levy is genuinly touching as a dad
who
tries to steer his son towards wholesome happiness.  I did wonder where
mom
was....but that's okay... this is a BOY coming of age story and like i say
at the top... They are evolving.  It actually seems to be okay to like
girls.  Thumbs up.<br /><br />Jolly regards
