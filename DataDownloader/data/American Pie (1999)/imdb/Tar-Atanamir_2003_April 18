OK, so a rational person like myself shouldn't find this gratuitously rude
and indecent film enjoyable - but it really is!!  A stand out character is
Jim's Dad, whose every moment on screen is comic genius.  Also, one of my
favourite lines ever is when Finch and Stifler's mom are doing it on the
pool table: &quot;MMM, Finchy&quot;. &quot;MMM, Stifler's Mom!!&quot;  Inspired!  Overall, not
one to watch with the whole family, but it's definitely worth a watch
nevertheless.
