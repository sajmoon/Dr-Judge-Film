American Pie is a really good movie
I thought all the actors really did well but the ones that i thought stood
out were Seann William Scott, Jason Biggs, and Kaye Thomas...Finch..  I
thought Chris Klein and Thomas Ian Nicholas had not that many funny lines
through out the series so far..i mean they both were basically in the
movie
for love and not really funny but they both did really well otherwise.
Alyson Hannigan did a really good job as Michelle...i thought she was the
best out of the girls in the movie
All in all i give this movie 4 stars ****
