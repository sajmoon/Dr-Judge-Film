1999_July 6 

The latest in the series of inane food product movies (following &quot;Canadian
Bacon&quot;), &quot;American Pie&quot; will leave you feeling like you've been smacked in
the face with one. Universal Studios took a poorly-written, typical teen
script and made it worse with hideous casting and lousy directing.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is a sadistic, mocking film that seems to savor the pain it
is causing the theatregoing public, many of whom have been dragged to the
multiplex by their dates. The humour is definitely of the New York City
sewer variety, and this film's creators seem to be in a competition to
outdo
the morons who made &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; and &quot;Big Daddy&quot; in
terms
of crudeness.<br /><br />This might just be a simple sleazefest if it were not for the absolutely
hideous choice of actors. Trust me--these clowns make the brats at &quot;South
Park&quot; look sensitive and deep. Natasha Lyonne, with her hair looking like
she just stuck a finger in a light socket, and her whiny &quot;I'm a goddess&quot;
performance leaving you wishing she had. Chris Klein, who was only cast in
this film because the producers couldn't come to contract terms with a
potted plant. Chris Owen, who is only suited for silent cameos, is given a
speaking part. (Aaargh!) Alyson Hannigan, whose character swings wildly
between slut and sweetie, is obviously way in over her head. And is it
just
me, or is the viewing public weary of hearing Tara Reid philosophize about
oral sex? To make matters worse, we actually have to watch her head
bobbing
around as she performs it! Should we be forcing teenagers to watch such a
disturbing visual image? It could turn them off sex forever.<br /><br />The best line of the movie--and the one you'll be repeating as you gaze
into
your wallet after the movie--is the one uttered by the jock when he wakes
up
in bed alone: &quot;I was used!&quot;<br /><br />
