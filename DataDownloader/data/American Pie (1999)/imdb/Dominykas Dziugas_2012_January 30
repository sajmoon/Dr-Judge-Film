If you hadn&#x27;t seen this movie yet you should see it right now. Of
course im not insisting you guys to watch it if you don&#x27;t like teen
movies but its classic of this kind of comedy.I mean it! This might
look little bit stupid because its like a &#x22;stupid comedy&#x22; Thats how i
like to call movies like this.Actually they aren&#x27;t stupid at all it&#x27;s
very hard to create jokes like this and make a movie like this.But I
could hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind
of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie
with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy
because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or
with your parent (depends who you are).<br /><br />This movie is way different is about teenagers life, and their jokes. I
could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever
seen! if someone asks for a comedy about teens first movie i say is
&#x22;American pie&#x22;. This movie would be best if you&#x27;re looking for
something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already.
Thanks for reading
