STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br /><br />This is another AMERICAN teenybopper vehicle,as if we hav'nt seen enough of
them,with the likes of 10 Things I Hate About You and Never Been Kissed
already.This one is fairly amusing in parts,and the charecters ar'nt
entirely unlikeable,but even still,it dos'nt go far in preventing the
cliches.***
