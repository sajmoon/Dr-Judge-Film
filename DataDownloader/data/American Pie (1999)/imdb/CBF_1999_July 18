1999_July 18 

At first, when I heard a movie entitled 'American Pie' would hit the big
screen, I Believed it would be about Buddy Holly's death(as was the song
under the same title by Don McLean was about).   When I heard it was a sex
comedy, I was offended, to say the least, and thought &quot;Oh great, another
&quot;There's something about Mary&quot;&quot;.   But, as i saw the film, I was even more
offended.   It has to be one of the worst movies spewed out by Hollywood
nowadays.   Whatever happened to the Noble movie?   Star Wars is one of the
last refuges to the ideas that noble beliefs can still be shown on the Big
Screen and still be entertaining, gripping, and interesting.<br /><br />And, what was even more offensive was in a commerical for 'American Pie',
it
had people singing 'How Sweet it is' to pies(something you'd have to watch
the movie to understand).   I took it as a personal insult(the movie, and
the commercial) against two songs in which I love(I hope Don and James
hears
about this outrage).   Take my advice, don't watch  'American Pie', go see
Star Wars again, or rent 'Shawshank Redemption'.
