I know when I was the age this movie is targeted to, I thought &quot;Fast Times
at Ridgemont High&quot; was incredibly funny (and pretty hot).  Maybe I even
enjoyed &quot;Porky's.&quot;  But apparently, I'm just getting a little too old to
appreciate the genre.  I sat here embarrassed for the characters, the actors
playing the characters, and me watching them.  Was I ever this
bad?<br /><br />The thing is -- I still think &quot;Fast Times&quot; is funny.
