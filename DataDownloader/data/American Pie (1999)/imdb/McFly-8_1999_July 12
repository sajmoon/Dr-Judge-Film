1999_July 12 

A particularly big deal was made about this movie in my neck of the woods
because it is set in West Michigan, where I live.  I saw this film
thinking
that it would probably be an embarrassment to the state but I left pretty
proud of the flick and its writer, also from West Michigan.  American Pie
isn't for little kids and it's not for older adults, its for teens and
twenty
somethings who have experienced high school in the 90's. These are the
people who will appreciate the film for what it is, an excellent comedy
that
personifies high school and exaggerates the experience just a
bit.
