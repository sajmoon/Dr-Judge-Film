&quot;American Pie&quot; may be the best teen movie ever made.  The acting is great,
and the story is full of heart, and very realistic.  Some of the feelings
the characters had were the same that I have had  before, and in that sense
this movie really connected with me.  Not to mention it is sooooo funny.
Every teenager should see &quot;American Pie!&quot;
