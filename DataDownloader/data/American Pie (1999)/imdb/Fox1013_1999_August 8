1999_August 8 

Probably the funniest slapstick movie of the year! I laughed out loud
non-stop! The story follows the attempts of 4 high school guys trying to
lose their virginity before they graduate. Their antics are ridiculous but
funny! Sure some scenes, like the pie scene or the &quot;stuff&quot; in the beer
scene, were nasty and extremely distasteful.  But the movie had strong
performances and a hilariously entertaining script. Shannon Elizabeth is
the
highlight of the film!  It comes across as a &quot;guy flick&quot; but I think both
genders would enjoy the film. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who
isn't offended by some extremely distasteful content.
