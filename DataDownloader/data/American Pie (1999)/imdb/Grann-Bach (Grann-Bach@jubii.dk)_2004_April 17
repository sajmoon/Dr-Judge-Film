This is pretty much the film that started the whole trend of making teen
comedies with a lot of sexual jokes and gags, and definitely one of the
best. Any teen will be able to identify with the situations and the
characters, at the very least to some degree. The plot is very good, and it
moves along at a pretty good pace; sort of laid-back, not too quick but not
slow either. The characters are all well-written, very real and even though
some of them are cliches or stereotypes, you can identify with them and
understand their actions in the different situations. The actors all perform
well, I didn't really think any of them did a bad job portraying their
respective characters. I think the script was very well-written, it allowed
for some extremely funny scenes(of course, there were also some right-out
disgusting scenes, this is an R-rated teen comedy after all), and most of
them were pretty true to life too. The humor was very good, and had an
excellent pace and timing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys teen
comedies, and aren't easily offended. Especially teens will like it, and
identify with a lot of it. 8/10
