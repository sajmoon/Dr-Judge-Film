I have no shame in saying this. If you are in anyway entertained by
this absolutely trashy soft-core porn-comedy...you are as lame as they
who made it. sex is not the biggest problem in this one, but it is a
neutral problem. Woody Allens' films are served with strong sexual
content, but in good taste. This film is , without a doubt, one of the
worst films ever made. The dialog is absolutely redundant in it's
low-quality meaning, and the acting is flat out bad. Jason Biggs, Seann
William Scott, and Tara Reid, as well as any other youngster in this
should all be put in a concentration camp for this mush, so should the
writers. I know how cruel that is to say, but it's true. This film had
two sequels that should have never been made either, just as this film.
I know for a fact that people in this country are just as careless with
the brains of an earthworm. I knew of children viewing this film and
many others, as its sequels. This shows parents are not doing their
jobs, and the future is in the hands of a bunch of morons! Morons are
why these films today are hopeless. I would'nt even give this film a
simple 1/10, because its rating is a BOMB BOMB BOMB!!!
