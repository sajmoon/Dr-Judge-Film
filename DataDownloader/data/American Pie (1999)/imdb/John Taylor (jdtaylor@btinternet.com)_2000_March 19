American pie is a typical American college movie that is all too predictable
and tries to be different by going for the shock factor but all it does is
confirms that the americans are really lousy when it comes to making good
comedies. why do they always have to involve some irritating college kid who
is trying to lose his virginity on the prom night. How many films have the
same old story?If i was you i would not listen to the hype and check out a
different movie because you will have seen a hundred films just like
this.
6 out of 10
