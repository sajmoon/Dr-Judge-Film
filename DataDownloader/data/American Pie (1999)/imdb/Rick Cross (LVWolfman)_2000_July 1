Thankfully, while not quite as raunchy as it was built up to be, American
Pie was so just raunchy enough that I thoroughly enjoyed this
movie.<br /><br />While the billing made it appear to be just another Saturday Night
Drive-In/&quot;We vow to lose our virginity by graduation/prom night/16th
birthday&quot;, American Pie was truly funny and touching.<br /><br />There's a heavy dose of morals and ethics in the message here which is
sneakily slid in among the beautiful women and comedic
routines.
