1999_November 30 

Of all the movies I saw in the summer of '99 (Austin Powers 2 aside) the
most funniest film I saw had to be American Pie.  It was definately the
`There's Something about Mary' of 1999.  The young cast pulled it of nicely
with great one-liners, original jokes and of course.....the apple pie scene.
 That scene will go down in history as being one of the funniest comedy
pieces ever.<br /><br />I am definately going to buy the DVD-Unrated version for even more laughs
for I am not a strong believer in editing.<br /><br />Out of 10...........9/10
