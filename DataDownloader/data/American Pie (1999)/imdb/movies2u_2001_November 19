  <br /><br />     American Pie is a *really* funny and likeable sex comedy. Jason Biggs,
Chris Klein, Seann Willaim Scott, Tara Reid, Tom Ian Nicholas, Alyson
Hannigan,  Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari, and Eugene Levy make up a hilarious
and likeable cast for the film. The film is upright hilarious and drop dead
funny. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm sure it's just as funny. Als,
Jennifer Coolidge did a funny performance as Stifler's Mom. By the way, take
my advice, because some people say that &quot;Scary Movie&quot; was better, but it is
DEFINETLEY not. American Pie is a fun and amusing comedy that any fans of
the cast, or fans of comedys, will enjoy. I give it a 10 out of 10.
