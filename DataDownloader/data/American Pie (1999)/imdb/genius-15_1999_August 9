1999_August 9 

    Well, in this world of mimicry, its no surprise that movie producers
have much less room for innovation than for duplication. American Pie is yet
another example of this. After the suprise hit &quot;Theres something about Mary&quot;
was released last year, Universal just had to get in on the action. So they
made a film with a similar theme, reduced the target audience age by about
10 years, and &quot;American Pie&quot; was born. Only now we have a film which is so
gross, so tasteless, and so immature that it makes Mary look like a G rated
family adventure. If you think the hair gel scene in Something about Mary
was pushing it, check out the expectoration-beer scene in this movie.<br /><br />I've always been a huge fan of the 1980s comedy skin flicks like Porky's,
and don't really mind gross humor (I loved Trainspotting) as long as its got
something good to balance it. But all this film has is annoying teens
drinking, reading porn, and finding new ways to beat a proverbial dead horse
(don't even consider that a pun) with a nonsensical apple pie scene that has
already been made notorious from TV advertisements. Sure there are a few
attempts to make this film seem original and innocuous, like a choir subplot
and Eugene Levy's fatherly concern (He happens to be a likeable guy), but
nearly every scene in this movie revolves around boringly crude bodily
function humor.<br /><br />Im sure this movie will do well when released on video, its an ideal teen
slumber party feature, but its a far cry from its much handier 80s
progenitors. If Cinemax ever decided to have an adult TGIF, this would
surely be their focal point. After all, its merely an R rated version of
&quot;Boy Meets World.&quot;
