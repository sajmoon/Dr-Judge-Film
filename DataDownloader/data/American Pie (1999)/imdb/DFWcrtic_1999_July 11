American Pie--which I had the (mis?)fortune of seeing at a preview
screening--does little more than shock its audience into uncomfortable
laughter. Although I must confess that I laughed aloud several times, I'm
ashamed of it. And while there is definitely an audience for this sort of
material, they most certainly should not be partaking of it.
Unfortunately,
the disturbing emphasis placed on underaged sex and the false message that
life as a prep school student consists of little more than trying to shag
anything that moves (or doesn't move--a pie, for example) is truly
stomach-turning.
