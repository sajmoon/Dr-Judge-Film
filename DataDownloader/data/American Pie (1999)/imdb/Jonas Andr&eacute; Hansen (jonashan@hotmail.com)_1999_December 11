And with a headline like that more people will read this comment, and sex is
what make this movie popular. I can see their point, but it was just too
boring. Sexual debut is something which is always funny to talk about, I was
therefore disappointed that this movie did such a poor effort. Some funny
elements, but too few.
 To the movies defence , I think one must know about American high school
graduation. Being from Norway I can't understand the big fuss about prom
night .
  All in all dull. Virgins will have no fun with this movie. And if you
while watching felt that you learned something, have another father-to-son
talk.
