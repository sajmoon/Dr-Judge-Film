God, I love this movie! Seen it 3 times and I still laughed hysterically! It
was original, hilarious, and heartwarming. All the guys in the movie are
cute, especially Oz and Finch (who in a way resembles a young Nicolas Cage).
Eugene Levy is also hilarious as Jim's dad, and the movie has it's
heartwarming moments as well. You can't go wrong here- laughs, romance, and
a story with real characters. I am owning this one on video! If you don't
laugh, check your pulse!
