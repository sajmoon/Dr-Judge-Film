A movie about teenagers and sex. This is nothing new. It would be no
surprise that this movie would spend it's opening week at #1. But would
there be substance to PIE or just flakes. As it began there were a few
laughs. I enjoyed the opening tube sock scene and the ordeal with the beer
at Stifler's party but it didn't impress me. Funny yes,...substance
no!
There more I watched the more I was impressed. It defined the teenage
male so accurately and comically while at the same time creating some
substance. Oz, a jock, explores his sensitive side in chorus and falls in
love rather than just lusting. Ofcourse there is lots of shallow humor but
that can be lots of fun too. 
I was especially impressed by &quot;Sh*t break's&quot; scene with Mrs.
Stifler...the &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; song playing (in reference to Dusitn Hoffman's
1967 movie &quot;The Graduate&quot; about his experience with an older woman ) blew me
away! I loved that a movie like this would pay tribute to such a
classic!
All in all, great flick for the younger generation to enjoy mostly. I was
surprise by the depth in this movie. AMERICAN PIE is more than just flaky
crust!!!
