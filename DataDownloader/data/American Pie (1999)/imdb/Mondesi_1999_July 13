Sweet Jesus this movie is hilarious. It brings back so many high school
memories, and even if it's been a while since you graduated you'll still
appreciate this movie. It deals with teenage coming-of-age and sexuality
in
a frank yet funny way. It does feature some so-called &quot;gross out humor&quot;
but
it's not bothersome at all and is actually damn funny, so you should dig
it
unless you have a giant stick up your... well, you know. The hairgel scene
in There's Something About Mary and the &quot;coffee&quot; scene in Austin Powers 2
are worse...
Okay it's getting late so I'll stop my comment here, but I can't stress
enough how funny this movie was. GO SEE IT.
