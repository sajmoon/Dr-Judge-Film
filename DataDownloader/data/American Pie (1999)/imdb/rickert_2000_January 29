The movie can be summed up in the title it had when writer Adam Herz
submitted his script to studios. &quot;Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be
Made For Under $10 Million That Most Readers
Will Probably Hate But I Think You Will Love.&quot; It was cheaply
made, and it has the words &quot;teenage&quot; and &quot;sex&quot; in it.  That
is
why the film got made, and that's just sad.  It really
wasn't
much of a comedy, it was just an excuse for a string of sex jokes and fart
jokes.  If done correctly, they can be clever
(see South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) but in this case,
the
film just seemed like an excuse to show teens having sex.  There was no
&quot;message&quot; or truth to be learned from the film, and that is why it failed.
Most of those teen sex films from the 80s actually had some kernel of truth
buried in them, but there's nothing here at all, except, everyone's having
sex and if you don't, then YOU'RE the abnormal one.  The one relationship
that I thought was going to be real was the one between Heather and Oz, but
instead it just got cheapened by their post-prom-sex.  The movie panders to
the worst parts of
teenagers, who are obviously the target audience.  The only effect I can
see
it having on them is to make them think they aren't drinking, screwing, or
partying enough.  That is totally the wrong message, but its the only one
that is apparent.
