I love this movie. It&#39;s one of my favorite teen comedies. The weird
thing is a lot of young people in my area don&#39;t like this movie. They
keep comparing it to &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, &quot;Animal House&quot;, or
&quot;Porky&#39;s&quot;. Why must it be compared to anything. It&#39;s just a funny
movie. I mean you&#39;ll never hear me say it&#39;s better than &quot;Porky&#39;s&quot;, but
it&#39;s still good stuff. I should say that most of the people I referred
to are mostly kids who just try to go against the crowd anyways. A
bunch of emo punks. I&#39;m not going to lie to you, I&#39;d like to take each
of them out back and beat em&#39;. Anyways, back to what I was saying, this
movie is hilarious. I remember when it came out I said that it would be
a future classic. Well we&#39;re almost up on the ten year anniversary. I&#39;m
gonna go ahead and say it&#39;s a comedy classic. It has everything you
could want. Sex, outrageous comedy, toilet humor, Eugene Levy, and
above all; the one thing that ties it all together... it has heart. It
has believable characters that your feel for. This is also the movie
that started the whole MILF thing. I mean if that alone doesn&#39;t
consider it a classic, I don&#39;t know what would. It was followed by two
theatrical sequels and three straight to video sequels. I know I have
been praising it, but it&#39;s actually my least favorite of the first
three films. I mean it&#39;s good, but the other two are better. OK this is
starting to drag so I suggest that everyone should watch this because
it is funny. That&#39;s it.
