1999_July 12 

I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and
finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I
was hooting and bending over in joy.<br /><br />There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for
moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews
(the
ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so
there are plenty of surprises.<br /><br />During the movie I kept saying, &quot;This is me and my friends when we were in
high school!&quot; They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and
girls; just not as frequently, but it's only a two-hour film. Any guy will
appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops
guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their
pants.<br /><br />What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the
filmmakers didn't feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters.
Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all
different,
which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays
out
on prom night.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the
guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a
film like this, where it's not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to
the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is
another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest
is
only one of them.
