I am a fan of teenie movies, I always love to watch them. Mostly, the
stories are pretty similar, but somehow this genre has a certain appeal to
me. Maybe because I never did something crazy in my teens? Who
knows.<br /><br />Anyway, American Pie is really a good movie, a splendid proof that the
teenie movie genre is not dead but alive and kicking, and that to portray
teenagers in a entertaining way, you don't have to kill them all off
(Scream, I know what you did last summer) or let them talk like old men and
women (Dawsons Creek) - you simply have to let them act like what they are:
Young people looking for the right way to do things, searching for their
identity and - off course the focus of this movie - for their sexuality.<br /><br />While the story is certainly not all new, the way in which it is shown is
really hilarious. There are some extremely well placed very crude, but all
the more funny jokes, and the characters are simply likeable in their
desperate attempts to loose their virginity. Highlights like the
&quot;rendez-vous&quot; with Nadja or the blow-job scene with the not so politically
correct disposal of the seminal fluid are simply too funny to
resist.<br /><br />All in all an extremely well done teenager comedy which I recommend to every
one who has stayed young at heart. Best to watch together with a bunch of
friends to start a party! Laughs guaranteed!!!
