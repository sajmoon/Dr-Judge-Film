Imagine &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High,&quot; but funnier and more poignant.
This
movie is about guys we all knew in high school (heck, some of us were these
guys) and every line, every moment rings true.  The buzz around this movie
are, of course, the gross-out scenes, but what makes this movie work is how
much you root for these four guys.  You may ask &quot;why I on earth would I
care
if these clowns 'get some' on prom night.&quot;  You do because the movie
accurately reflects that sex is on every teenage boys mind, all the time,
while reminding us that it's really the women who control the situation.
