Very lame and unoriginal film; just another teen gross-out/sex movie, of
which there have been waaaaay too many lately, all too similar - people have
had sex with food in better movies (read BETTER, not actually good).  I've
read that this is actually the 'defining' movie of my generation.  Pretty
unnerving.
