Ok, at first i wasn't going to reply to this movie.  I felt that there was
no reason to.  But after seeing negative responses to this movie b/c of
its
crude nature, I had no other choice.  This movie, in my opinion is the
best
comedy of the 90's.  I remember when this movie first came out, I went to
see this movie 3 times in the movie theater.  I did't even see the Matrix
3
times in the movies.  I not only own American Pie 1, but i own American
Pie
2 as well.  I'm also looking forward to American Wedding.  Anyways, back
to
the matter at hand.  This movie is CRUDE.  This movie is STEREOTYPICAL.
This movie has NO PLOT.  However, this movie is not necessarily AMERICAN.
it should just be called &quot;PIE&quot;.  in fact, the original name of this movie
didnt even have AMERICAN in it.  if you can not relate to this movie, you
must have some genetic defect.  american or not, this movie relates to
every
growing teenager thinking about sex.  it has its crude humor and i love
it.
i love crude humor.  i love howard stern mornings and i love porkys.   i
like when people eff up and i love when laughter is pointed at others.
call
it sadistic, but i think alot of you people need to lighten up.  this
movie
is a light hearted comedy and if you can't find an ounce of humor out of
it,
i'd hate to even know you.<br /><br />IF YOU FOUND PORKY'S FUNNY...RENT THIS!  WAIT...BUY THIS!  GOOD DAY TO
YOU!
