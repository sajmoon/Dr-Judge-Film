Capitalizing on &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;'s success, &quot;American
Pie&quot; has some Michigan high school students trying to lose their
virginity. The most famous scene of course involves a certain pastry,
but there are plenty of other gross-out scenes (namely the beer).
Really the best character in the movie is Eugene Levy as the kindly dad
who's always willing to talk about sex and everything related thereto.
I haven't seen any of the sequels, and it seems that most of the
unknown cast members haven't done anything of particularly high quality
since this movie came out (although Shannon Elizabeth and Jason Biggs
both had great roles in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;). All in all,
this movie is ridiculous, but pretty funny. On the subject of anything,
would that one scene with Shannon Elizabeth - you know which one I mean
- count as one of the famous sex-drive-inducing scenes in movie
history?
