I thought this was a very funny movie. Not an uproaring laugh-a-lot movie,
but still quite humorous from time to time. Sean William Scott has got to
be
the best young actor out there today. He's so funny and quirky, and seems
to
be a natural at this college-party animal character. Jason Biggs is good
as
an unconfident Jim who falls in on the bet with his friends to lose their
virginity before high school's out. All I need to do here is say Shannon
Elizabeth and everyone knows what I'm thinking. Chris Klein was also an
exceptional actor, playing the sweet sensitive Oz quite effectively. And
Jim's dad, Eugene Levy, is yet another reason us Canadians are some of the
best comedy actors in the business- we're a little wierd and off the wall,
but still funny in that shocking, embarassing sort of way. Thomas Ian
Nicholas and Tara Reid co-exist quite well, playing the confused couple
who
wants to please each other. I mean, some of the dialogue may be stupid,
but
it really fits the story and keeps this witty piece of our time
rolling.
