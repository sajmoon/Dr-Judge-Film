1999_July 13 

Before I begin reviewing the movie, I would like to ask those of you who
have panned this film for being juvenile, why something with sex jokes, or
masturbation jokes, is automatically immature and unintelligent.  After
all
these things certainly go on in our society and in the lives of teens
today.
Any subject, as long as the the way it is presented is clever, can make a
good joke.<br /><br />Now, I have to say that this movie was hilarious, but it also had a lot of
heart.  The point of this movie was not to gross the audience out or to
satirize teenage life, but to be a celebration of a difficult but fun time
which all of us go through.  These characters are not one-dimensional
losers
as in satires like Beavis and Butthead which attack the stupidity of the
generation, but real likeable people going through an extremely tough time
which all of us know about.  The gross out jokes work so well in the
movie,
cause we all know they are true.  All of us probably know someone who
would
masturbate with an apple pie to get a better feeling.<br /><br />The performances in this movie were mostly excellent.  I especially liked
Mena Suvari as Heather.  Not only is she beautiful, but she seems destined
to be a romantic lead in the class of a Meg Ryan.  Jason Biggs and Eddie
Kaye Thomas were brilliant as two awkward teens.  Eugene Levy is hilarious
as Bigg's awkward dad. Although she was not given much to do in the movie,
I
think that Natasha Lyonne could be the standout of this film.  She is so
great at playing girls with tough exteriors, like in Slums of Beverly
Hills.
In this movie, she steps up the attitude, and crudeness, giving some of
the
funniest lines in the script.  All in all, I would say this is a great
teen
movie, up there with the Pretty in Pink's and Say Anything's of the late
eighties.  American Pie is hilarious not because of it's crudeness, nor is
it insensitive towards women like Porkies, but because it shows in a
humane
way the insecurities of an everyday teen.
