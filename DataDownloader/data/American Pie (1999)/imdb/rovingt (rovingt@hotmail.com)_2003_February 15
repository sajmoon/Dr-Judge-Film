Crude, rude, crass, sophomoric and predictable at times, American Pie is
carefully crafted to appeal to a range of audiences.  But whatever you
can
say about it, for me the whole thing works!<br /><br />I do not think you can view this movie as simply the exposition of late
20th
century mores viewed through the lens of the average hormonally driven
American male.  Rather it is at once and the same time an exposition
about
expectation.  The expectation of the time after high school, of
relationships, of new found physicality, of intimate expression, of going
forward into the future.<br /><br />Herz and Weitz craftily use the testosterone enriched environment of high
school as the vehicle on which to carry this theme.  While many
characters
in literature and cinema have embarked on their own search for truth,
American Pie is more about the embarkation upon the journey than the
journey
itself.<br /><br />The theme is repeated over and over again, and subtly (as distinct from
the
crassness of much of the movie) reinforced through out the film.  The
journey is presented in the choices of colleges, the coach's speech at
the
lacrosse game, the `bus' to the prom night party and the duet sung by
Heather and Chris.  It is expressed most poignantly by the characters of
Vicky and Kevin when they recognize that while they have each consummated
there love their futures will lead them to something different than they
had
envisioned just hours before.<br /><br />The late teen years are perhaps the only moment in time when the future
potential of each of us is present in such abundance and so readily
convertible into present achievement.<br /><br />If you are young (a late teen) and you watch this movie consider how this
movie presents a modern parable to you about all the future potential you
have before you and how this moment is a but a temporary gift, to be used
and enjoyed before it becomes the prevailing present.<br /><br />If you are older, allow the magic of celluloid and the fine craft of the
writer, director and actors to transport you back to a time when the
future
beckoned and each experience was as new as that spring day on which this
movie begins.<br /><br />
