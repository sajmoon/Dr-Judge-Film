&quot;American Pie&quot; is certainly not one of my favorite movies; however, I will
say that it left me laughing very hard.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is a crude movie and should not be seen by young children by
themselves. The performances were nothing special but with the talent
attached; &quot;American Pie&quot; gets the job done to my satisfaction.<br /><br />The best part about this movie is that the cast enjoyed &amp; knew what they
were doing at the same time. I must give credit to the Weitz brothers for an
outstanding and convincing job how high school really is.<br /><br />This is an humorous movie with an okay plot and average performances.
