...&quot;American Pie&quot; is a ridiculous and vulgar High School
coming-of-sexual-age comedy. A pathetic cinematic endeavor,
this senseless string of vacuous gags and situations is
not
for the jaded or sophisticated and will play best in frat
houses and college dorms or to audiences with a similarly
unfettered sense of humor. The number of shelves the video
occupies at Blockbuster is a reminder that &quot;popular&quot; is
often synonymous with &quot;mediocre&quot;.
