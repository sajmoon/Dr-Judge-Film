&quot;American Pie &quot; isn&#39;t so funny as some people says .Actually ,it&#39;s way
too conventional and predictable . The plot ?A group of teens makes the
promise to have their first sex experience before the end of the year
.That would be the chance to replace the story with many gross and
disgusting jokes that aren&#39;t very relevant . And ,of course ,this movie
also reduces the women to the role to be sex objects . Likable
characters ? Actually I find them very annoying . Sean William Scott is
probably the most annoying actor in the recent years . Many movies
repeat the formula of this movie ,like &quot;OLd School &quot;. I&#39;m sorry ,but
John Landis have make a story like this ,and far away better in &quot;Animal
House &quot;.
