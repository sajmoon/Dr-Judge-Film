American Pie is the funniest, most interesting and surprisingly consistent
movie I've seen in a long, long while. This is probably due to the fact that
the script writers actually thought when they wrote the script! Unlike the
writers of Runaway Bride and Carrie 2. When I saw this movie the whole
cinema was full and it was such a great atmosphere because people were in
constant hysterics from start to finish. Make sure you see American Pie,
you'll only be disappointed if you decide to see Wild Wild West
instead!
