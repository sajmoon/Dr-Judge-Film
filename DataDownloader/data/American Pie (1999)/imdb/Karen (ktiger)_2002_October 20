This movie was so funny.  It's not that often that you can go see a movie
that makes you double over in laughter.  I recommend this movie to people
who have an open mind and can relate to the changing modern times.  You
really need a good sense of humor to watch this film.  I think the acting
was great.  I mean you have to be great to do the things these people did
in
this movie.  On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 10.  It was just
that
funny.
