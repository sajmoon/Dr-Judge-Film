OK, OK, OK so this movie is loved and revered by hundreds of millions of
teenagers (probably WORLDwide), but trust me, it's nothing new, nothing
original - a total retread of 'Police Academy'-style eighties comedies
except replaced with the typically crude, arrogant teen actors we see
cropping up all over the place. Whatever happened to good old fashioned
raw
talent? As they say, your neighbors vacation videos might be less painful.
Substitute another feature for this one.
