1999_August 10 

In twenty years, this movie will rank as a classic of cinema.  Just like
&quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; &amp; &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, the movie is ageless &amp;
timeless.  Its my favorite movie of the year by miles - saw it with my
Mother, who is crowding 60, and we were still laughing in the lobby on the
way out of the theatre.  An extremely entertaining movie that you'll love,
if you'll allow yourself to.
