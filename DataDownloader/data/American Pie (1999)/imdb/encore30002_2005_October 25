when i started watching this i was like yawn!!!! but then it got
good!!!! i would recommend it to anyone at any age people wanted to ban
it!!! that is crazy it is rated 15 or R for a reason so people underage
cant see it. so if you haven't seen it go and rent it or buy it. you
are missing out on so much!!!! i mean i have watched like 20 million
times and I'm still love it. 10 out of 10 first class stuff man. i love
the pie!!!!!!!!! and if u haven't seen it get a piece of it u will not
regret it!! i was laughing so much wen i first watched it i instantly
knew it was one of the best films i have ever seen and i had already
seen scary movie!!1 all the characters are so cool (even the band
geeks).
