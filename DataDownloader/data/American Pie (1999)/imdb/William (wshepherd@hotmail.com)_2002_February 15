Maybe the writers were thinking, &quot;Let's try to make the worst possible film
and see if people will watch it anyway.&quot; Sadly, some did just
that.<br /><br />American Pie, unfortunately, wasn't one of these &quot;so bad it's good&quot; movies;
it was just gut-wrenchingly awful (and it may permanently ruin your tastes
for baked goods). Do not see this movie; it's highly overrated.
