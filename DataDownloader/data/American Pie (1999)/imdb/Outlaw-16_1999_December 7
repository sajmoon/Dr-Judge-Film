1999_December 7 

I was so hyped to see this film and when it was over I was completely in
shock about how mindless this film was.  I can see why younger audiences
might like this film because there's really nothing to compare it to.  As
for the 24+ crowd, we've seen this before during the early and mid 80's.
I
hate to say this, but AMERICAN PIE makes PORKY'S seem like an AFI top 100
film.  At least with the latter, there was more plot to it than just
trying
to get laid before a certain time period.  I've seen a more developed plot
in a haiku than AMERICAN PIE.  And as for the humor, every joke you could
see coming from a mile away.  It seemed that filmmakers went to great
lengths to set up every one of the jokes, even if that meant compromising
the story, or lack of, with contrived elements to make the joke work.
Wait
ten years and watch this movie again and I'm sure you will have a much
different spin on it.<br /><br />And for those of you who are comparing this to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY... please don't!  TSAM is such a better film because the humor seems
very spontaneous, and the film is made by people who understand how to get
a
legitimate laugh.  Timing, originality, and the element of surprise are
the
keys to making a funny movie.  If you know the punchline before the joke
is
over, how is this funny?
