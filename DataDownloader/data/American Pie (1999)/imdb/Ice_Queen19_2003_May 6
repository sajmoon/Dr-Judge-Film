I saw this movie a few years ago when I was around 14. I must say, I was
pretty disturbed with some parts of the movie, especially since I saw this
as a freshman in high school. Thinking back on it, it was a mostly an
amusing movie with a weak plot. The main character in this movie, Jim
Levinstein (Jason Biggs), is a senior in high school and he is urging his
girlfriend, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), to have sex with him.  In the end
she
does after the senior prom. Jim tries everything from giving her an orgasm
through oral sex to sweet-talking/persuasion. This story is surrounded by
the issues of Jim&iexcl;&macr;s schoolmates, Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein),
Kevin
Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), Paul
Finch
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen).  Jim and his friends
make a &iexcl;&deg;pact&iexcl;&plusmn; to all get laid (have intercourse) before high school
graduation. All of his friends succeed, except for Chris, who ends up
finding his &iexcl;&deg;true love,&iexcl;&plusmn; Heather (Mena Suvari). There are many
entertaining scenes, especially with Jim&iexcl;&macr;s father (Eugene Levy), Jim
getting caught many times doing&iexcl;&brvbar; erm.. &iexcl;&deg;inappropriate things.&iexcl;&plusmn; It is a
stereotyped movie that adds funny scenes concerning high school, senior
prom, and sex. I&iexcl;&macr;m sure some of this happens in the high schools around
the
US, but I&iexcl;&macr;m sure that not all students have sex after senior prom, as
this
movie alludes.
