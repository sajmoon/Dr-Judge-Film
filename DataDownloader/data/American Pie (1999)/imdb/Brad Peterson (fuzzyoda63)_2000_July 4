This movie is a hilarious romp through the maze of adolescence and the
pressures of sex.  It captures the awkward, the funny, the moving, and
inquisitive side of being a teenager.  Despite its raunchiness, this movie
has an emotional core that is more about growing up and love than it is
about getting another notch on the belt.
