1999_June 21 

I got to see a rough cut which still said &quot;roll credits here&quot; at the end
of
it but it looked finished with exception of sound which was not
synchronized
well.<br /><br />The movie is filled with sexual jokes which get tired very quickly and the
movie becomes very boring.  I think that the
movie is stupid, boring and not funny... but that is just my
opinion.
