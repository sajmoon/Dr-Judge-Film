It&#x27;s gotta be the best movie EVER. Honestly, I think the day I watched
the last part of the series was the worst day of my life. It lost all
meaning without American Pie. It wasn&#x27;t easy to continue a normal life
after 6 days of American Pie-ing. And then one day, I came to know
about American Pie 7. Colors rushed into my life, everything seemed so
beautiful.<br /><br />I might&#x27;ve exaggerated a bit, but yes, that&#x27;s the sort of effect you
can expect the series to have on you. American Pie isn&#x27;t just a movie,
it&#x27;s a brand, an icon with a huge number of fans worldwide. If there
was ever a movie that deserved Oscars and BAFTAs, this is it. It&#x27;s the
most well executed movie/series in this genre (teen sex comedy) ever
made. The actors don&#x27;t seem to be acting, they&#x27;re rather living their
part.<br /><br />You don&#x27;t need to think twice before seeing it, run like mad to the
nearest parlor, rent it, and wait till folks at home are asleep. Just a
tip, if your parents&#x27; room is close to yours, you might wanna lower the
volume a bit in the beginning. :P
