Unlike the film Porky's , American Pie is a sex comedy not only about sex,
but also about true love. Most sex comedies deal with funny sexual
encounters, but really have no meaning. This movie has funny sexual
encounters, but all for the right reasons. There is true heart behind this
movie, and that is hard to find in sex comedies. 9/10
