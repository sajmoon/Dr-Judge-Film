The first American Pie is the best American Pie out there in my
opinion! (and probably the best of teenage comedy).<br /><br />I watch it 100 times and I still laughing about their jokes and Jim
(played by Jason Biggs) is a truly funny character with all his sex
experiences and the advices that his father (Eugene Levy) gives to him,
are awesome! Stifler (played by Sean William Scott) is also a very
funny character! Shameless and he plays a real &#x27;macho-men&#x27; very well.
In spite of being a movie that doesn&#x27;t have any brilliant performance
and doesn&#x27;t have any complexity that puts the actors in difficult
situations, it&#x27;s a pretty good film with lots of funny moments, lots of
nudity, sex jokes and scenes, all the ingredients to make a very good
teenage comedy!<br /><br />So, if you&#x27;re a teenager with a tough &#x27;sex life&#x27;, watch this movie and
you should learn something (or, at least, have a good laugh)!
