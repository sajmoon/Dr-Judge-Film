When American Pie first came out here in Australia, I thought that it
would
be just another lame teen film. So I dismissed it. But after much urging
from my girlfriend I finally went to see it and was pleasantly surprised.
This
was such an enjoyable and fun movie to watch and i can't wait for the
sequel.
But i'm still baffled as to why most people say that this film is too
risqee. I mean sure it was nudity and adult themes, but so what!!!. Let's
just cast our thoughts back to one of the last scenes of the movie where
there is a sign congratulating the seniors on graduating. The sign says
congratulations seniors, I think we all know what that was actually
refering
to though, don't we?. lol
