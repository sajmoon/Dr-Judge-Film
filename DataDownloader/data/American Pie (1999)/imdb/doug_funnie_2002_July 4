I can't explain why this movie is so amazing. I just love it, it's one of my
all-time favorite movies. American Pie is groundbreaking in movie history as
it explores issues no other film has touched. It's a movie for teens and it
is incredibly and amazingly enjoyable. I loved every single second of this
movie, the script and directing is well done and all of the main and minor
actors play their role well including Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William
Scott, and of course Jason Biggs. But the one thing that makes the movie
completely enjoyable is the gross out humor and sexual exploitations, all of
which are done very well (which is rare). American Pie is a movie to go down
in history as one of the best teen movies of all-time, and although it's not
a movie for everyone, it's definitely one to watch with
friends.
