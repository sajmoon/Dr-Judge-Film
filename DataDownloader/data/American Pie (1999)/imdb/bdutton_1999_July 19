1999_July 19 

I would gladly recommend this movie to anyone who has experienced high
school.  (Just about everyone over the age of 15!)  There are very few (if
any) bad parts of this movie.  It was a light-hearted high-school romp with
a bent on teenage masturbation rituals and sexual awkwardness.<br /><br />If you don't like movies that make reference to sexual experience (or lack
of)... skip this one.
