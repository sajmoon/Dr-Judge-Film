Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian
Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, Veronica
Cartwright. Terrifingly shocking masterpiece about
a commercial spacecraft responding to a distress
signal from a derlict spacecraft with mysterious,
haunting results onboard while bringing back an
unauthorizied passenger.Scott's gothic direction,
Weaver's essential performance, Oscar-winning  
special effects, Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score, and
the ominous score all contribute to the film's essential
viewing. Successfully followed by &quot;Aliens&quot;(1986) and two
other sequels and influenced various rip-offs.
