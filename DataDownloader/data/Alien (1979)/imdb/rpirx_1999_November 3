1999_November 3 

The first time I saw Alien (and I keep watching it again and again) it was
the only movie that really scared me. I found the suspense almost
unbearable. I attribute this to the fact that not only you don't know WHEN
the alien will turn up, you also don't know WHICH FORM it will have then.
You are left wondering (and fearing).
