This would have to be one of the worst sci-fi movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />It took to long to get to the plot, the plot was bad (not mentioning
was it is).<br /><br />It wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, it was boring.<br /><br />The best part of the films is when the credits start, it was still
pretty boring then.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good sci-fi movie watch Aliens(number 2) or the
fourth alien movie.<br /><br />It is definitely the most boring and worst alien, sorry sci-fi movie
out there.<br /><br />Stick to watching star trek or star wars, something good, not some
rubbish, cheap film from the 70s.<br /><br />But it was good that some introduced an alien into a movie, but they
picked the wrong movie.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH. BORING.<br /><br />0.5/10
