2005_September 7 
Still claustrophobic and frightening after all these years. And after
all the bad sequels (with the possible exception of 'Aliens'/1986) and
poor imitations.<br /><br />This is the original, this is the real thing. They try and try and try
again, but they can't do any better than the original. I watched it
first time in 1979 at a movie theater and I keep watching it on video
and never get tired of being amazed and scared by this sci-fi/horror
masterpiece.<br /><br />Ridley Scott: Why don't you quit making forgettable things like
'Gladiator' or 'GI Jane' and go back to your best?<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith: we miss you and your work.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver: You were hot in this one, and never got hotter since
then.<br /><br />Forget the sequels, this is the real thing.
