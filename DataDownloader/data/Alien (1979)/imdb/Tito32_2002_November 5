The best sci-fi horror (along with The Thing) ever.Ridley Scott has never
been better and the monster is simple the greatest in motion picture
history.It`s arrival in &quot;the evening meal scene&quot; is one of the most iconic
moments in cinema.Still as scary,shocking and brilliant as back in
1979...
