There were times when Ridley Scott made first-class genre pics, well,
eh, two pics to be concise: &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; and this spine-chilling
space horror movie, which is still his best effort.<br /><br />It&#x27;s basically an old-fashioned monster movie, complete with cats
hiding in the dark and false attacks, but the accoutrements are
ingenious: the Alien&#x27;s design, right down to its parasitic ways of
spawning and breeding, is - one might say - lovingly detailed; the
expressionistic set-pieces feel just right; Weaver&#x27;s heroine lends a
touch of intelligence and vulnerability to the proceedings that avoids
the usual genre movie machismo; the low-key characterizations of the
crew members don&#x27;t resort to clich&#xE9;s; and some nerve-wrecking shock and
suspense scenes, interrupting an otherwise effectively unharried
story-line, are masterly handled by Scott and his expert team.<br /><br />9 out of 10 gut-bursting baby Aliens
