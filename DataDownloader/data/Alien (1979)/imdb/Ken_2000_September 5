In 1979 Alien made its appearance on the silver screen. However most fans of
the film that were not at the Premiere showing do not realize that they
missed The Real ALIEN. Selected theaters throughout the country were allowed
to show a full un-cut version of the film that contained numerous scenes
that were not released on later showings. The scenes created an almost
unbearable amount of tension and fear. Scenes that show the Alien
head and extended tongue appearing out of a total black background and then
slowing withdrawing back into total darkness while the crew is searching for
it. The studio, wanting to tone down the film for general consumption,
deliberately removed scenes like these. It was thought that in its original
state the movie was to powerful and would have a negative effect of sales.<br /><br />Some months later after the sales slowed down the movie was brought back to
the theaters and advertised as &quot;See Alien with scenes never before seen.&quot;
Unfortunately we may never see the Real Alien film.
