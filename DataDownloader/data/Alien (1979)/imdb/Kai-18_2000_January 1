2000_January 1 

Styled after those 2 great 50's films the fear factor is doubled and the
gore factor is a lot bigger.  Though the &quot;Alien Birth&quot; scene wasn't as
graphic as I expected it certainly was incredibly gross.  Ripley is a strong
female character in this film.  I hear in the original cut she dies and the
Alien contacts Earth using her voice.  Don't watch this alone in the dark. 
Great scare flick.
