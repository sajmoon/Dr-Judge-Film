1999_December 8 

Alien is one of the great science fiction films of the seventies, a
successful marriage of the increasingly dry genre started by 2001: A Space
Odyssey with the gore of the contemporary splatter flick. It's a great pity
that the series was then entrusted to that he-man James Cameron who turned
it into another testosterone filled gun show  (albeit one with terrific
action sequences.) Credit Dan O'Bannon's screenplay and an outstanding cast.
