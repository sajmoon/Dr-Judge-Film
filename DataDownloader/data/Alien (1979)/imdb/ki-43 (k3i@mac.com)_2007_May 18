One of the best films ever made in any category. This movie set the
template for the others to follow. A lot of people like II because it
had more action. That&#39;s why the first wast the best it wasn&#39;t
interested in creating horror but terror. Huge difference, horror is
the gory stuff you see as an end result. Terror is inflicted in the
mind. The film wasn&#39;t so much about horror as it was about the terror
that comes with a creature that can&#39;t be reasoned with yet, it is as
intelligent as humans. I&#39;m amazed at intelligent movie goers claim not
to like this film over the others. Yet, the others would not have a leg
to stand on without this film. It made me want to make film and watch
film of equal depth. The idea of the creature is flawless on par with
the terror experienced in watching &#39;Silence Of The Lamb&#39;
