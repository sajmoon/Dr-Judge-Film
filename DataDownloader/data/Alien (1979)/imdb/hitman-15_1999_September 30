1999_September 30 

I really had high hopes for this movie. I've seen the others and thoroughly
enjoyed them (except Alien3), so I was sure this one would be a stunner. But
it wasn't. There were some good bits, and plenty of tension, but I found
myself getting bored between the special effects sequences. Oh well, it was
worth watching, just not as good as I thought it would
be.
