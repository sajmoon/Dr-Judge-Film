&#145;Alien' is possibly the ultimate sci-fi/horror film. Containing everything
needed to make a great movie, from excellent special effects to extremely
tense moments it is one rollercoaster ride that is not to be
missed.<br /><br />Following a distress call the team of the Nostromo crash land on an
uncharted planet. While the ship is repaired an away team is sent to
investigate the SOS call and begin to explore an alien vessel. During their
exploration one of the team is attacked by an unknown life form which
attaches itself to his face. Unfortunately they weren't to know the hell
that was about to be unleashed.<br /><br />What can be said about &#145;Alien' that hasn't already been said? Ridley Scott's
masterpiece (and still his best film in my opinion) stands out against
almost all of the recent sci-fi and horror movies as being possibly one of
the greatest movies of the last century! Incredibly atmospheric and
delightfully watchable, this movie is a must see for genre fans, and for
casual movie fans too!<br /><br />Scott's direction is superb and very little he has produced since has been
able to match his accomplishments with &#145;Alien'. Terror and despair are
created among the confines of a futuristic space ship without resorting to
quick shock scares or unbelievably high volume music. Instead Scott manages
to create an exceptionally dark and eerie atmosphere by building up suspense
and showing little of the creature that is stalking his characters.
Personally I believe that the alien creature is the single most realistic
looking alien creature I have ever seen and the beauty of Scott's direction
is we have little chance to see any different. The way tension is built is
reminiscent of the horror classic &#145;Halloween' (1978) directed by John
Carpenter, yet contains much more style, flair and general suspense than
Carpenter's masterpiece. As in both films the `killer' is not on screen too
often and therefore remains a deadly figure of mystery. How can you stop the
hunter when you don't even know what it is that's hunting you? Intense and
persistent fear are created by Scott in this nerve-wracking
movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver played her best ever role here in my opinion as Ripley, no
role since has she made her own as much as this. From the onset Ripley comes
across as a very tough woman but still sensitive enough for the audience to
have sympathy and to connect with her. Unlike many `tough chick' roles that
become annoying, Weaver became a character that the viewer became attached
to, perhaps even became an idol in a way. Her interaction and mannerisms
throughout the film were very believable and all this was aided by a
beautifully tight script written by Dan O'Bannon. Never have I seen someone
play such a believable character in a futuristic (and therefore currently
unbelievable) premise. Weaver was also brilliantly complemented by Tom
Skerritt who played Dallas. Their on-screen performances with each other
were generally quite dramatic and rather intense which blended well to the
feel of the movie. These two great performances accompanied by the
delightfully wicked and dark performance from Ian Holm as Science Office Ash
leads me to think that &#145;Alien' has one of the most brilliantly assembled
casts in film history. <br /><br />&#145;Alien' is a suspense packed sci-fi/horror thriller which has to be seen to
be believed. If you haven't already seen this movie I highly recommend it
and its first sequel (&#145;Aliens'). Both films have their own unique charm and
attraction and it is obvious in my mind why people debate over which one is
better. Personally I prefer this great original and feel that it is
definitely one of my Top 10 movies of all time. My rating for &#145;Alien' &#150;
9.5/10.
