2004_March 13 

Seeing this movie now in 2004, is a bit funny, first of all many of the
scenes in the movie has become somewhat a cliche, and this has obviously
been ia inspiration for many movies to come after.<br /><br /> But obviously this is one of the milestones in the cinematic history, even
though it is from 1979 it is still a fantastic and stunning movie, both
visually and psychological, as i wrote on topic.<br /><br /> There are many good points of this movie, first of all the script is
absolutely great, gripping, original and controversial, full of different
twists, some more obvious than others, one of the best scenes of the movie
is the one where Ash turns out to be a computer, and the following
interviewing scene, a scene that can definitely come up for debate of our
curiosity for finding foreign and unknown organisms to explore, are we
perhaps too curious and eager? Not something i'm gonna discuss with myself
here, but it's an obvious opinion there, and something Ridley Scott may be
very interested in exploring more, which he has done already with Blade
Runner i guess.<br /><br /> Another strong side, and again, praise to Ridley Scott, the direction of
this movie is nearly perfect, i can't find any spots to put my fingers on
and criticise, all i can say is that he did a fantastic job creating a
atmosphere that stuck to your back, again, some things here have been copied
and thus seen before, but it is still one of the best direction i have seen
ever, the work with the flickering lights, the many aspects of the image,
the, at times, alternative and experimental use of the camera, there are so
many good aspects of that, and this movie could have been a lot worse
without Ridley in the lead.<br /><br /> The special effects really is the only point that annoyed me a tad, but
considering the movie is 1979 and we are now in 2004, i don't think it's
something i wanna get into, the monster so to speak wasn't viewed a lot of
times, which added to the psychological part of the movie i think, the many
silent scenes where you follow the characters is the real backbone of the
movie, not the monster, which is good i think, horror movies shouldn't
always be focused on what the eye can see, but maybe rather than on what the
eye can not see.<br /><br /> 9/10
