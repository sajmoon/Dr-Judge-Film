1998_September 30 

I realy like Alien and I've watched it many times. The film is something
special and I rank it amongst the best ever made. There are a lot sci-fi
movies being made that can be categorised as cartoonish, or cheapiah. But
this movie has style and it is far from cartoonish.<br /><br />The design of the ship is realistic and the attention is being paid to the
ship's rules (quarentine rules and chain of command). The characters are
also believable, whining about payment and the way things are going. Further
more, Ridley Scott's directing is supurb and he created the movie as if we
were there; This could be a real event in times to come, and in the Science
fiction genre reality is rare.<br /><br />The story is rather simple: Monster gets onboard and starts killing. But
that isn't a negative thing. As the simple story creates the time to show
details of life on a space-craft and makes you believe you are a watching
real people in a real situation.<br /><br />The actors are good and well casted, every scene is right and some of them
are quite memorable, like the visit to the Alien ship, Kane's last supper
and Mother's countdown.<br /><br />This movie never gets boring and is a real treat. The sequels are also quite
mentionable, especially Aliens, which is less stylish, but with more
action.<br /><br />Martijn Meijers
