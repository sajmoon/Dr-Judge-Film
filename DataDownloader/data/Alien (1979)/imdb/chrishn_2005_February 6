In &quot;Alien&quot; we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the
huge space freighter &quot;Nostromo&quot;. The crew is in cryosleep, but the on
board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is
picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands
to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...<br /><br />What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right
from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew
is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all
the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out
industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a
prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also
the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest
monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite
completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the
monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has
no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or
intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized
intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything
human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the
inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up,
you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of
in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which
thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the
humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own
ship.<br /><br />Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of
visuals and sounds. <br /><br />The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but
very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood
heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes
and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with
the enemy. <br /><br />As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to
the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an
effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable
to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of
the ship is basically a huge basement. <br /><br />The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the
movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds
of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. <br /><br />This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against
evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the
fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate
with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a
story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed
by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely
random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live
and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the
fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all
seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are
true heroes, and none of them are true villains. <br /><br />All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't
just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so
effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the
end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies.
The title &quot;Alien&quot; doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of
the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie.
