Alien ****<br /><br />In Space Where No One Can Hear You Scream. What a great tag line! Alien
scares as well as to keep you guessing where the Alien is going to show
up next and when it does, without hesitation, you jump out of your
seat. What Ridley Scott has done here is take completely quiet moments,
(Some horror films take moderate quiet moments), and then make the
unexpected happen. The story is also great. In todays horror films, you
don&#39;t get great stories. Another thing that this movie does is it takes
it&#39;s time on where it wants to go and doesn&#39;t rush it. Today&#39;s
audiences are so impatient with horror films that takes it&#39;s time that
the director doesn&#39;t have enough time to deliver the goods. Alien also
has that Gothic feel to it, and man doesn&#39;t have a Gothic feel to it.
Suspiria has the same kind of feel but in Alien, the feel is more
authentic mainly because it&#39;s in space, (However the Gothics in
Suspiria is also authentic because of it&#39;s subject matter and the weird
production designs). Alien has definitely stood the test of time.
