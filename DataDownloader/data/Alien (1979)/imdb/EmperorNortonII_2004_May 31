&quot;Alien&quot; was a movie that caused a real sensation.  It is filled with shocks,
thrills and suspense.  Sigourney Weaver made her name here as Ripley, an
officer on the Nostromo commercial spaceship.  The story follows Ripley and
her shipmates on a horrifying discovery, that leads to more and more
terrors.  In &quot;Alien,&quot; there are many memorable scenes, some bloody, others
not so much so.  The imagery provides a good tone of suspense, especially
H.R. Giger's immortal designs for the Alien itself.  These images are
especially monstrous!  The special effects aren't as impressive, compared to
today's digital animation standard, but the blood flowing here still makes a
real impact.  This science-fiction horror movie will definitley haunt
you!
