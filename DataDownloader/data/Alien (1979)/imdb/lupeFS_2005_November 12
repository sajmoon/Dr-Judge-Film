This is the absolute best outer space motion picture anyone would have
conceived. A ridiculous idea of an alien on board a spacecraft made
into a Gothic horror film that has terrified audiences and has spawned
a franchise. So far, Ridley Scott did an excellent job as director and
still does (see Gladiator). Also as Weaver's first appearance in a
film, she was excellent.<br /><br />But I think that a bigger exploration of the derelict could have been a
bit affective, and the alien pyramid in O'Bannon's original script. But
still, it's good as they get. <br /><br />The DVD is very impressive as well, with the deleted scenes, but the
scene in which Dallas in found by Ripley in the climax, would have
screwed it up, but I think with a bit of things cut, it would have been
affective.
