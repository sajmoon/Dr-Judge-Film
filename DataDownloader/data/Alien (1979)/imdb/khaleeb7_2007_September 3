What more could you want? A great cast - my fav actor killed off first
- a dark brooding, almost realistic atmosphere and a damn bad-ass
monster make this a very realistic scary film. <br /><br />What i found very enjoyable is that if you have never seen this film,
you will not realise who the hero will become...who gets bumped off
first and where&#39;s the damned monster? How big is it? When it is
unveiled, then we are treated to an unforgettable unmasking! <br /><br />I also loved the &#39;clunky&#39; spaceship - much is more realistic than the
Star Trek Vision (not that i dislike that). Scott has a realism at
looking at the future as a dirty mechanical place - think Bladerunner
in space.<br /><br />I hope a new generation of fans watch this!!!<br /><br />K
