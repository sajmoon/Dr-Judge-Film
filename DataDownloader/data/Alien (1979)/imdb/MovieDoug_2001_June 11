Alien is a good thriller movie from Ridley Scott. This movie can be compared
to it's(in my opinion) superior sequel Aliens. Both missions are sabotaged
by a shady Company worker like Ash and Burrke. But unlike Aliens the theme
of Alien is basically, 1=where is it? 2=what is it? and 3= how do we kill
it? The theme of Aliens is &quot;There it is lets kick it's ass!&quot; However Alien
is an interesting thriller movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
The main thing scary about it is that no one really knows what it is or what
it is capable of. That is why it a good thriller.
