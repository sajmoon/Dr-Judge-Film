Things I remember best about Alien:
Seeing it during its opening run in Times Square at 3:30 am, the only
time I
have attended a movie at that ungodly hour. (My best friend and my
girlfriend talked me into it.) And I've gotta say -- it did keep me
awake.<br /><br />I liked the beat-up condition of the ship, and the Corporation being the
villain, but beyond that I found the story predictable. The men of
Nostromo
couldn't've been more doomed if they'd had &quot;dead meat&quot; stenciled across
their foreheads. I knew way ahead of time when each one was gonna get
it --
I might even have been muttering, &quot;this one's a goner&quot; or supplying the
screen characters with lines of my own like &quot;oh, why don't I go alone
into
this dark place -- it should be easy to kill me there!&quot;<br /><br />I'm not saying I didn't jump with the rest of the audience when each
pathetic sucker got the coup de grace from the rapidly evolving Alien.
But
that's shock, not suspense. And it's a very old formula, one that I
believe
goes back to the silents, the old haunted house where characters get
separated and picked off one by one. Not inventive. Not surprising. Not
involving.<br /><br />The stomach-buster was kind of cool. It grossed me out, and I certainly
remember it. But the one moment I found completely captivating was when
they
rip the bad guy's head off ... and he keeps talking. Now, THAT was
spooky.
The android doesn't care about dying... because he's not actually alive.
Without missing a beat, he keeps telling 'em they're all doomed. And just
for a second I had a flash, a vision, of a whole other, more fascinating
movie.<br /><br />Then poof! it went away again. To sum up: while the monster design was
effective and original, and Sigourney strong and sexy, much else fell
flat.
I'm proud to hold the minority opinion, that this film is overrated in
the
extreme. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars out of five.<br /><br />Except for having five endings where one was needed, Cameron and Hurd's
ALIENS is stronger than Scott's ALIEN in every way. [Maybe they were
given
the franchise just to humiliate him?] I felt completely involved with
Ripley
and the little girl. Lance Henriksen's GOOD android (to make up for the
first story's BAD one?) was sympathetic, too. Maybe this isn't a fair
comparison. As others posting here have pointed out, ALIENS is a whole
other
genre -- more action/adventure than horror suspense.<br /><br />I'd Compare ALIEN instead to John Carpenter's remake of THE THING. I
prefer
THE THING. And the 40's black &amp; white CAT PEOPLE. And the original
NIGHTMARE
ON ELM STREET. And CARRIE. And, of course, every horror movie David
Cronenberg ever made, even the one he made right out of college that
must've
cost 75 cents (THEY CAME FROM WITHIN). His films always make your mind
bend
while your skin crawls.<br /><br />Not having seen ALIEN in twenty-three years, maybe I oughtta rent it and
give it another chance. Then again, I still haven't caught all these
great
new filmmakers from Iran...
