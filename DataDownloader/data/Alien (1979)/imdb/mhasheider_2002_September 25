Remarkable (and ingenius) mix of pure science fiction and horror (or
suspense) as the crew of a mining ship who have an unexpected guest board
their vessel on an unknown planet and the strange chain of events that
take
shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver both made a name for
themselves due to their efforts here.  And so does the rest of the
supporting cast (Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright,
Yaphet Kotto, and Harry Dean Stanton) deserve some mention for their
portrayals here.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is one of those films that shows that no one should like being
alone in the dark.  I remember watching the commercial for the movie when
it
was going to be shown on network t.v. during the eighties.  Just seeing
the
creature make its' way around the ship just scared of the daylights out of
me alone.  That's how great this movie is.
