Back in 1979, for some strange reason I do not remember, I waited
impatiently for weeks (or months?) to finally see Alien. Maybe I got a
glimpse of the surreal trailer on TV and was hooked by its
impressionistic images and stroboscopic editing. That makes sense, I
had plenty of time to watch TV in those days. I was only thirteen at
the time and watching plenty of American shows.<br /><br />I remember finally seeing it at the RIO cinema in my little french-
speaking town of Sorel near Montreal during Christmas time &#x27;79. That
was not a great cinema by today&#x27;s standard. Bad screen, bad anamorphic
lens and bad monophonic sound. But when the dissonant strings of Jerry
Goldsmith started after the FOX logo, with the slow appearance of the
title, I was hooked. And what I remember in my mind of that first
screening is in 70mm with THX sound...<br /><br />I did not know what to expect at all from that movie. I was of course a
sci-fi geek who had seen Star Wars at least five times and Battlestar
Galactica a couple of times too. But NOTHING prepared me for what I was
about to see.<br /><br />We were introduced to a sci-fi world but in a way that was almost
&#x22;cin&#xE9;ma-v&#xE9;rit&#xE9;&#x22;. Unlike most sci-fi films of this time, the story was
not written to accommodate big sets and expensive special effects but
the other way around. So much details in everything. And all that was
casually presented as we were discovering the crew of the Nostromo,
waking-up with them in their futuristic environnement but at the same
time, feeling at home with them, feeling ourselves part of the crew.<br /><br />Then, the story shifted to the Alien&#x27;s planet and it became an odyssey
into the unknown. My thirteen year-old mind was petrified from that
moment on.<br /><br />In retrospect, I can say I lost what was remaining of my childhood
innocence on LV-426 (The Alien&#x27;s planet)...<br /><br />Today, I am waiting for Fox to release the Blu-Ray edition of this
movie and I am thinking: NOTHING had ever been presented on a movie
screen with such majestic horror.<br /><br />The biomechanical Gothic design of H.R. Giger for the Alien&#x27;s
environnement and the Alien itself was the biggest contribution of pure
art in a movie since &#x22;Un chien Andalou&#x22;.<br /><br />That contribution, along with the visual panache of a young director
named Ridley Scott, a flawless Terry Rawling&#x27;s editing and powerful
score by Jerry Goldsmith achieved what could be one of the most
complete work of art that Hollywood ever made.
