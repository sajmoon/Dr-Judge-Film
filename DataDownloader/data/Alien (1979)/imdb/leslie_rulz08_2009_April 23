From Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator (2000), Black Hawk Down
(2000), Hannibal (2001), American Gangster (2007) &#x26; Body of Lies
(2008).<br /><br />A seven member crew are aboard Nostromo, a spaceship. Nostromo is
returning to Earth from Thedus but on the way, they pick up what seems
to be an S.O.S. They investigate the signal but a creature attaches
itself onto one of the crew members face. Desperate, the other crew
members take him back on the ship where the creature dies off his face.
Soon a small alien finds its way out of his body &#x26; runs off into the
depths of Nostromo. The crew members are ordered to capture the alien
until they realize that the alien has has grown into the perfect
killing machine.<br /><br />Alien (1979) is a classic horror/thriller film. It is also known as the
best science fiction film ever.<br /><br />Anyway, let&#x27;s get to the points to Alien. The plot is good and is
played out better than the story itself. But the film just isn&#x27;t scary.
In 1979 it may have been scary. But now with all the sequels &#x26;
crossovers...you just know what the alien looks like. So my advice if
you haven&#x27;t seen the sequels or crossovers then you must watch this
first.........unless you get bored easily. Because this movie is
extremely slow and takes extreme patience to sit through. Yet i&#x27;m not
saying that Alien is a bad movie. It is far from being a bad movie.<br /><br />Let me get you started. The acting. Very realistic and VERY good...this
film won Oscars! PS the movie stars SIGOURNEY WEAVER. Her character was
likable and very strong throughout the film. Funny too. The FX. One
word. Incredible!!! Scary. No. But the Alien is scary &#x26; mysterious.
Also the movie has it&#x27;s moments. A lot of &#x27;moments&#x27;. Suspenseful isn&#x27;t
the best word to describe this film. Intense it is. Tense scenes
abound. Also some people have been bashing this film because it&#x27;s
clich&#xE9;d &#x26; stupid &#x26; predictable. Well, the film is heavily clich&#xE9;d &#x26; has
it&#x27;s stupid moments but this IS Alien. One of the movies that started
the clich&#xE9;s. Let&#x27;s move on. The location is outstanding. The atmosphere
outstanding. Pretty much the whole movie is outstanding. BTW. Don&#x27;t get
over-hyped. You have got to remember, the movie is a very slow SCIFI
flick and was made in 1979. So it involves complicated heavy dialog.
Another thing, the movie has a classic-gory scene involving a chest &#x26;
the alien. Also, the rest of the movie is gory but those scenes go
quick so keep your eyes peeled. Kinda violent too.<br /><br />All in all, an outstanding science fiction/horror CLASSIC.<br /><br />4 out of five stars.<br /><br />Followed by a sequel Aliens (1986).
