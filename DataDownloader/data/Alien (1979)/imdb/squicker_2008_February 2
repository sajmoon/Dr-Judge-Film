The definitive sci-fi horror. Perfect pace, that naturally unfolds with
no contrivances. <br /><br />The most frightening and mysterious organism in cinema, the perfect
cast, with ideas and design that still have not dated to this day. <br /><br />A futuristic vision that is still futuristic and will always be
futuristic. <br /><br />The minimalistic but perfectly executed plot, use of colour and the
score creates an ever present sense of claustrophobia that lingers long
after the end credits. <br /><br />This is how to make the perfect science fiction film, and it&#39;s flawless
elegance will never be surpassed.
