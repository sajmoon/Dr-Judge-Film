2002_January 11 

To tell the truth, I watched ALIENS before I watched ALIEN.It was fine,
and
it did make an impact (after all I was just 12 or 13), but a few years
later
I watched the first movie. That one really did it for me.<br /><br />Alien is such a simple concept as the one's you find in video games: you
are
alone trapped with a killing menace and you have no way to escape: the way
out is to kill it. But the way the story is depicted is what makes it. You
could not expect this plot-line to be better handled (especially if one
considers the menace is an alien.) than it was in this movie. The crew of
the Nostromo is a group of people as distinct as your own group of
co-workers with all the pros and cons that come with them.<br /><br />The best thing about this picture is that it doesn't seem that you're
watching a picture at all, it seems more like an edited set of images
someone collected from a real ship. And even if it doesn't have that
constant action of Aliens, it is far better to watch .The way it would be
like if it happened for real. The strain is so intense that you can almost
see it in the air.
For the people who watched it before ALIENS, I'm sure they weren't
expecting
to see Ripley being the one who made it.Since I'm a woman myself, I like
it
that she and the cat were the one's who managed to pull
through.<br /><br />This is still one of the pictures that scared me the most.try watching it
alone in a dark living room like I did the first time, not knowing what to
expect from it.
It's the best Alien and one of the best suspense/thriller/horror movie
ever.
