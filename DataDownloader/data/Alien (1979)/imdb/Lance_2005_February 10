I've never seen a more perfect blend of sci-fi and horror. H.R. Giger's
alien design is very unique and horrific. Scott's choice to refrain
from showing the creature too much was brilliant. Every time we do see
it, we are caught between wanting to turn away or observing and taking
in every detail of the creature while we can. Along with Jamie Lee
Curtis of 'HalloweeN', Sigourney Weaver makes one of the greatest
heroines in film history. And Jerry Goldsmith's score is very haunting
and atmospheric. If you can get your hands on the original DVD release,
there is an alternate rejected score that Goldsmith composed. There's
an alternate Director's cut which features a few new scenes that are
irrelevant to the story, but they are welcomed anyway. Most of the
following sequels were quite worthy entries, 'Aliens' actually being my
personal favorite film in the entire series. If you haven't seen it, do
so. It's a must.
