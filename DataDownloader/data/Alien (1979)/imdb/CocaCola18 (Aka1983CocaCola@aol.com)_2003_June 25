(TAKEN FROM PREVIOUS COMMENTS I MADE UNDER A DIFFERENT
NAME)<br /><br />Star Wars for grown ups? Oh no it's completely different! This is a chilling
suspense thriller all the way!<br /><br />A bunch of astronauts on there way home to earth...they get a distress
call...they do not ignore the call, and they embark on some visitors of the
&quot;Oh my God NOOOOOOOOO! Argggghhhh!&quot; kind!<br /><br />I will say though that I found the build up rather slower than it should
have been<br /><br />But anyway this maybe Ridley Scott's finest 116 minutes!
