Alien (by Ridley Scott), despite some opinions to the contrary, is an
exceptional piece of film-making. It is, in fact, an icon of horror
science fiction, better than anything of its kind until that date
(1979). Bad films are ignored, and this portrait of character has been
anything but ignored. It is therefore by popular opinion a significant
and memorable work of Gothic horror. Those who disapprove of Alien are
generally eager for action horror, and this is not an action horror.
Aliens (by James Cameron) was an action horror - a very different kind
of movie. Alien 3 was a Gothic horror once more, but not even
comparable in quality as Ridley Scott&#x27;s vision. Alien Resurrection was
an action horror, but not even comparable in quality as James Cameron&#x27;s
vision. <br /><br />If you are interested in the *aesthetic* use of film in this sub-genre,
there are few movies that surpass this one. Prove me wrong.
