1999_April 23 

Many would agree that Alien is truly a revolutionary film. But even though
excelling in categories such as originality, music, or special effects, it
contains some very distracting elements which make much less believable.
First of all the crew: don't anybody tell me that in such a huge and
expensive ship were only five people. And the way they are dressed is
ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is the beeping and flashing computer
hardware. I know that was the state of computers back in 1979, but the
filmmakers should have predicted how computer technology would develop. Then
there is that nonsense phrase &quot;molecular acid&quot;, which is included to lend a
&quot;scientific&quot; feel to the film. Everybody knowing meaning of the two words
knows that the phrase makes no sense. I know that most people would not
care, but this a sci-fi movie and therefore should be scientifically
plausible. The movie is also too dragged out at parts and boring.<br /><br />All in all, Alien is not as great as its rating might suggest, but still a
good movie. I give it 7/10. Its sequel, however, is a mind-blowing adventure
far surpassing its predecessor.
