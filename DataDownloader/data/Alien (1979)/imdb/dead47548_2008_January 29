I&#39;m kind of at a loss for words. Needless to say, I&#39;m very
disappointed. I thought the film was one of the most excruciatingly
dull I&#39;ve ever seen. It just dragged on and on, with even the violent
scenes were the alien attacks being completely uninteresting because
you see nothing that happens. It&#39;s just some blurs, some terrible
acting, a closeup of the mouth and it&#39;s over. The characters were total
clich&eacute;s and completely uninteresting ones at that. I didn&#39;t care once
about what was going to happen to them. I was just praying they all
died and the film ended an hour before it was supposed to. The film
wasn&#39;t remotely suspenseful or engaging. A lot of scenes were
unintentionally laughable because of how absurd they were (like the one
in the picture above) or because of how contrived and idiotic they were
(like Ash being a robot). As much as I want to give this film a below
average rating though, there&#39;s no denying that it&#39;s technical aspects
are phenomenal. The art direction and makeup completely revolutionized
science-fiction and the cinematography is ingenious. But when all is
said and done I was just bored to tears and extremely disappointed.
