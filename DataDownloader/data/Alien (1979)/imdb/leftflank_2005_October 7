Twenty-five plus years later and still nothing compares to this film.
While Cameron's follow up was quite good, it never really captured the
essence that made Scott's film stand out above every other piece of
sci-fi and fantasy ever made.<br /><br />If you break it down, Alien is a very simplistic tale with throw-away
characters that play second fiddle to the sets and the alien beast. The
plot is pretty thin and has been copied a million times since. But what
we have here is a film that is so much more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Alien is the first and ONLY sci-fi film where the alien elements seems
to be, well&#133;truly alien. Much of this is due in part to H.R. Geiger's
disturbing art, as well as Scott's very strict adherence to it. When
you see the alien ship, or the chestburster, or the adult alien for the
first time, they not only look and feel real, they appear truly
bizarre; just how an extra terrestrial probably would.<br /><br />Another reason this film works is the natural way in which the actors
play their parts. Dialogue flows in a disjointed but never confusing
manner, just like real speech. Everyone reacts the right way at the
right moments, and while you never get to know any of the characters
very well, it's the believable performances of the actors that allow
you to connect with them.<br /><br />Goldsmith's score adds a lonely and distant feel to everything,
reminding you of just how isolated and desperate the crew are. I really
wish this album would be remastered and re-released in its complete
form. It really is a haunting collection.<br /><br />While I feel that the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes very, very close
in terms of film craftsmanship and atmosphere, nothing else has ever
came close to immersing me in a fantasy world as this masterpiece of
film did.
