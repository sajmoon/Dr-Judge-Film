&quot;Alien&quot; is the greatest monster movie ever made! EVER!!! It is scary, smart,
and has established a creature that forever exists in our nightmares!  I
never have bad dreams about movies.  This is the only thing that has ever
shined in my dreams.  And the nightmares are so vivid and scary.  It's rare
that a film affects us so deeply.  Besides being a scary monster movie, it
is an art film. Director Ridley Scott makes art films.  The way the greasy
hallways, clanging chains, and dripping water make the atmosphere
frightening, and helps make the creature inconspicuous.  There won't be
anything like this again, except poor imitations like &quot;Species&quot;, and other bad
rip-offs.  I have seen this film over 100 times, and it still scares me half
to death.  This is an all time classic that must be owned!  And if you're 
lucky, be sure to surf the net and find the notorious missing scenes!
They're awesome!
