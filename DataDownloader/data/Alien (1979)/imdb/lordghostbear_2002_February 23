This is a very well done movie. I am a huge fan of Ridley Scott's movies
and
I have to say this is one of his best(next to Bladerunner). It has some  of
the best scary moments ever. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) Has to survive
against the beast from hell after the whole crew gets killed. Great Plot,
Great Cast, and Great scary Moments.As soon as i see the sequels I'll see
if
they live up to its first movie. So what are you waiting for go see it!
