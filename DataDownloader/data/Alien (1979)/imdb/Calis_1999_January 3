1999_January 3 

This film is the benchmark for all sci-fi/horror films and at the rate
Hollywood is going it will be for a long time. I first saw this film when I
was about 12 years old and I sat awake all night afterward just thinking
about the alien, I was totally fascinated by it, I would never in a million
years have imagined a creature like it. I am now 27 years old and I'm still
awed by this creature and because of its originality this film will never
become old, I just hope that no one decides to do a remake (Psycho), if FOX
decides it needs to do a remake they should just re-release it and let new
generations enjoy this brilliant film as it is.
