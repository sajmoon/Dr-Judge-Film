There are some science fiction movies we may stay with at one time such as
Star Wars or Star Trek but sooner or later it'll come to an end. As for
Alien , it'll keep on going. <br /><br />There's no telling how many times I've watched it and I enjoy it every time.
It's so realistic it'll make you think - what if something like this
actually could happen ? It still freaks me out when I see that chestbuster
scene and when they discover what's on Kane's face when they return from the
spaceship. I give it a 10.<br /><br />As for the second , sure those marines were tough and ready to fight , but
the sad part is they had no idea what they were going to
fight.
This gets a 9.
