Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow
moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the
acting so excellent that I&#x27;m never bored. The movie builds up the
tension so masterfully you&#x27;re on the edge of your seat all the time.
I&#x27;ve heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will
answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some
mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it&#x27;s
movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it&#x27;s only
for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than
most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the
reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately
old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie
just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.
