This movie holds a special place in my heart. It was my favorite movie
when I was a kid and I continue to hold it in very high esteem. I don&#39;t
know what it was about it that intrigued me so much when I was young.
It was probably a combination of the stark photography, the deliberate
pacing, the creepiness and mystery of the set pieces, the unique
futuristic grittiness (&quot;The used future&quot;, as George Lucas went on to
call it) of the production design, the now-clich&eacute;d &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;
storyline, the naturalistic and unpretentious performances, Jerry
Goldsmith&#39;s effective score, the then-original combination of science
fiction and horror, the lack of dependence on subplots and dialogue to
carry the film and how the characters and the film remained interesting
without it, and most importantly, how something that can seem cool for
a kid (I.e. outer space) can suddenly become the most terrifying thing
ever. Ridley Scott knew how to psychologically terrify his audience
with this setting and I couldn&#39;t get enough of it.<br /><br />Also, this is one of the first R-rated movies that I saw. But I wasn&#39;t
traumatized but exhilarated and appropriately scared. It triggered the
kind of fear that helps you get in touch with something primal. That is
I love these movies, especially this one.<br /><br />What is also incredible is that this film is imitated endlessly both in
space and on earth. The more of them I see the more I see how unique,
groundbreaking, and spellbinding this film truly is. I am truly
thankful that I had this film to educate me on how movies should be
made and how they should always allow a psychological element for the
audience once in a while especially in these kinds of thrillers. A true
masterpiece.
