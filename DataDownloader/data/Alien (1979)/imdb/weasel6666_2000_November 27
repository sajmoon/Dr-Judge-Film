alien is already a classic and it's for many the best sci-fi movie of all
times. i think he has only one opponent: star wars.
Ridley Scott made this movie in 1979, and he created one of the scariests
monsters in the history of movies, the alien. a monster that has acid for
blood and a double mouth. he also give birth to sigourney weaver (the
eternal ripley) who becames a star in this movie. we can also see tom
skerrit in this movie, giving us a good performance. scenario in this
movie
is claustrophobic and the soundtrack is great. in short this is a must see
for all sci-fi lovers. all the others that are not fans of sci-fi i'll
give
three reasons why you should see this movie: it has ridley scott print all
over it, it has sigourney weaver first debut and it has the alien. for all
the alien fans... do i really have to point out the reasons? watch it all
over again just because you need to.
