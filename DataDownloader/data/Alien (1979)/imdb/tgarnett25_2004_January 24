One of the few times when science-fiction was taken seriously (though _2001:
A Space Odyssey_ is another, beautiful, case in point.  Ridley Scott once
said that he aspired to be the John Ford of science-fiction in the cinema,
and watching this film again makes me grieve that he shucked that ambition
aside.  Likewise, H.R. Giger--we would prefer to hear from you sooner, sir,
instead of later.  From the typewriter of Dan O'Bannon, the scenarist
overcame the basic, B-Movie premise by being smarter, and more talented than
your typical Hollywood screenwriter.  The only sequel to come close to this
tense, horrific ambience was Fincher's _Alien 3_.  <br /><br />Very close, actually, but still...not quite.  Ten stars.
