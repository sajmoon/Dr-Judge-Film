Talk about trendsetter! Don't believe all the nonsense
from
all those theme-park minds claiming that Aliens is a much better film!
It's
no way near. If you don't believe me rent both films
10 years from now. Alien will hold forever, whereas Aliens
doesn't even hold water today. Don't get me wrong, Aliens
is
not a bad movie, not at all, but it's an action movie, not
an
inventive horror movie. Alien invented the dark, greasy, claustrophobic
look
everyone's been stealing since. Because
there's one problem with guys like Jim Cameron (and Spielberg);
They know how to make lots of money and that's it. Period. They'll never
be
Ridley Scott or Stanley Kubrick, no matter how
many Shindler's or Titanics they make. Don't get suckered in,
see the true original.
