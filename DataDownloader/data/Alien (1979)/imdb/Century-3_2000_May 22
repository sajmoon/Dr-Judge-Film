This movie is perfect. It is mysterious, dark, scary and most of all
enjoyable. The script is very original. The direction and the acting are
good enough. Perfect special effects for 1979. The worst thing the sequels
made was that they made us know who the survivor would be, otherwise you
wouldn't be able to imagine it. Another reason that makes this movie perfect
is the fact that it reminds me of the place and of the period I first
watched it. I was 13 then and I was in Lesvos (a Greek island). Since then,
every time I go there I watch all of the Alien series. Madness!
