I can understand the impact of this film to the moviegoers back in 1979.
Back then the form of the alien is not much known. People had to sit until
the end of the show to catch the glimpse of the monster. We know that the
characters had been killed when we heard them screamed or suddenly the radio
went off.<br /><br />But I feel that the younger moviegoers (generation-Y???)nowadays may find
'Alien' boring. First of all the movie move very slowly much like '2001:
Space Odyssey'. In addition to this, the alien is no mystery anymore. People
can buy the alien figurines almost anywhere. We saw the alien and said, &quot;Hey
this alien is cute, can I keep it?&quot;<br /><br />I think it is not very harsh to say that the scary element in this movie is
not that relevant anymore. And it can be watched once only to enjoy the
suspense.....no good action in this movie, sorry. <br /><br />For action and movies that can be watched several times go for 'Aliens' or
'Alien Resurrection'.
