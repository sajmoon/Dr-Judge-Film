I am a huge fan of horror films, and when I go to see a horror film I
have high expectations. Alien more than delivered these expectations.
The beginning is very slow, but it helps build up to the main plot very
well, and just adds on to the terror as the characters are also
developed. The horror scenes are very scary as they can be unexpected
as to where the creature is. Overall this movie was scary and could be
disturbing for some as well. The acting done by Sigourney Weaver is
very well done, although the rest of the cast doesn&#39;t really give an
amazing performance. Sigourney Weaver&#39;s (or Ripley) terror seems
convincing throughout the whole film. FOr a movie made in the 1970s,
the special effects were very amazing, as if they were just bad special
effects in this day and age. The alien was very well made and seemed
real. This movie was one of the original horror movies that set the
standards for all other horror movies in this era.
