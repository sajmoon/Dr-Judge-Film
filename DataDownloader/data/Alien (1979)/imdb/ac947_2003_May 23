An absolutely wonderful film in many respects: acting, set design, music,
story line etc.  Horror at its best.  Weaver is stunning.  The lack of
establishment shots creates a horrific disorientation and claustraphobic
effect which reminds me of Carl Dreyer's Vampyr and to a lesser extent
Hitchcock's Lifeboat.  Certain to top my list as one of the greatest of the
genre.
