Alien is a masterpiece...and one of Ridley Scott's best films, along with
Thelma And Louise, Blade Runner, and others (but not Gladiator!!!)...This is
not only a suspenseful film, it's also an esthetically perfect movie.  The
dark planet where they find the eggs, the spaceship with incredible lighting
effects, all this atmosphere makes the film one of the scariest you'll ever
see.  The sound is also perfect, with a calm ambiance, that suddenly breaks,
but stays in a very special mood.  The acting is very good, especially from
Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.  It's one of those &quot;It started it all&quot;
movies...many many many cheap and stupid rip-offs were made...the storyline
is so simple, but they made such a beautiful film with it.  And in despise
of what many people say, &quot;Aliens&quot; isn't better than &quot;Alien&quot;, it's just about
the action factor...but the beauty of the first one is only seen in the
first one...The storyline is the following: Some people on a spaceship
capture a creature on a strange planet, and it evolves, and starts killing
the passengers...conventional, you'll say?  Maybe, but being conventional
can be very good, it depends on the what you do with your storyline...let's
take the example of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; from director Tim Burton, which has a
very simple story, but the images are so nice and perfect, and dark that you
can enjoy a lot more the movie than you would enjoy a very complex
movie...&quot;Alien&quot; is for people who can recognize good directing, and a good
atmosphere, otherwise, if you prefer action, see &quot;Aliens&quot; or
&quot;Alien:Resurrection&quot;.  But this is the first and the best of the Alien
series...and I'd say my second favorite Science-Fiction movie, after 2001:A
Space Odyssey...Extraordinary film! 10/10
