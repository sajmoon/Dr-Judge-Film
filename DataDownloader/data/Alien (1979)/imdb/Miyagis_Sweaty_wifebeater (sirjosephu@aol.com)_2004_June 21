Alien (1979) was one of the first films to take a horror elements and
successfully place it within a sci-fi picture!  A space cargo ship is out in
the middle of space searching for salvage and what nots picks a distress
signal from another ship.  The alien ship has crashed landed on some good
forsaken rock in the dead of space.  When they land upon the desolate
planet, the crew picks up a very unwelcomed visitor.<br /><br />Great stuff and highly recommended.  Like most popular genre films this one
started a movie franchise and a number of knock-offs. 
Sci-fi
movies were never the same after this was released.  An essential film for
any true horror movie buff or sci-fi junkie.  This movie launched the career
of Sigourney Weaver and director Ridley Scott.  A psuedo-remake of the
seminal sci-fi film It! The Terror Beyond Space.  Elements from Dark Star
(also written by the screenwriter) appear in this one as
well.<br /><br />A+<br /><br />&quot;In space, no one can hear you scream!&quot;<br /><br />
