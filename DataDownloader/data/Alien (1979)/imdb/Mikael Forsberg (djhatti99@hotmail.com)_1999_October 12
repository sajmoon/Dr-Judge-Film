the original &quot;all alone in outer space hunted by a big slimey monster&quot;
movie, and IMHO its also one of the best. considering it was made in 1979
the effects and the scenery is outstanding.
its sequel &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;alien 2&quot; is also a great movie which continues the
saga in a good and believable way.
