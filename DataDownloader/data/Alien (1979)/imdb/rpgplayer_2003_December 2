This in my opinion was the better one of the series.  It filled us with
suspense, and kept
us (us refearing to my family) gussing every step of the way.  But i think
the second one
was better because the film packed more action.  The only downpart to this
movie was
that the alien never acually got a name and we never saw its full body
fully
because it
was always in shadow.
