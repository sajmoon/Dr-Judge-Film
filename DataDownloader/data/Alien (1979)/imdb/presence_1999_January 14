Alien was an absolutely brilliantly filmed movie.  Ridley Scott really knew
how to create an atmosphere suitable for this movie. The Nostromo was
totally desolate, with long hallways and empty rooms.  The music and sound
is very quiet, which is perfect for creating suspense and horror.  What
really stands out from this movie however, is the Alien itself.  The biology
of the Alien is absolutely intriguing; a lifeform perfectly suited for
destroying other lifeforms.  A genre defining movie that is one of
hollywood's best.  10/10
