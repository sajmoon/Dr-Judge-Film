1999_September 7 

Alien is the perfect science fiction ending of the 70:s. No one has gotten
close to that lonely feeling of eternal space and claustophobic panic mix
ever since. (well maybe Event Horizon) Superb classic soundtrack and for you
guys out there that have not seen it yet, it should serve as a good
substitute for you people that thought Star Wars was too
childish.<br /><br />
