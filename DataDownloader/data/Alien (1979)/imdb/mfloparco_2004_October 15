&quot; I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathy.&quot;
(Ash) What are the chances we'd see a movie like Alien made in 2004.
Slim to none. Movies today are used as tools to sell us products and
entertain out limited mental and emotional intelligence. Studios know
the &quot;American Public&quot; will invest in their product whether or not the
product is of any value to the consumer. The entertainment business is
more concerned about selling a product than expressing artistic
freedom. Can you imagine the &quot;dinner scene&quot; filmed in 2004? Kane would
be eating Space McDonalds and drinking Space Starbucks before his space
visitor made an appearance. Another example, Mother would become The
Microsoft Nostromo Pentium Computer. &quot;Alien&quot; would have to be altered
because it doesn't target the 12 to 18 age-group. The screenplay would
be altered to dumb down the language and add &quot;cliche pop phrases&quot;. The
first 45 minutes would no longer build up the exposition;instead, the
Nostromo crew would encounter the &quot;Alien&quot; within 15 minutes and the
rest of the movie would contain useless CGI. &quot;Alien&quot; shows us once upon
a time you could make movies free from corporate influence.
