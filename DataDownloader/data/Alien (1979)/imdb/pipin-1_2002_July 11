The film that made Sigorney Weaver a star, this wonderful mix of sci-fi and
horror sees John Hurt harbour an unknown creature that bursts out from his
chest in one of the most violent few minutes of footage ever, in a
commercial movie. We soon discover the threat of the monster as it
relentlessly picks off its victims one by one. Although many regard action
maestro James Cameron's 1986 sequel the finest in the series, Ridley Scott's
original has all the classic elements of a traditional horror film, and,
unlike the sequels that followed, we see very little of the alien until the
ending, which adds a wonderful sense of suspense that the other films never
quite captured.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen this film, and you're a fan of either sci-fi or
horror, this is for you, and even if you're not, &quot;Alien&quot; certainly won't
disappoint. It also features one of the most famous taglines in cinema
history.<br /><br />Great sci-fi horror.
