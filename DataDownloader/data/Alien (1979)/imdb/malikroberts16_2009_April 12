I remember the first time I ever saw &#x22;Alien&#x22;. It was back in 2003 on
Halloween. I took the day off from school and my dad and I went to see
it at Union Station in D.C. It scared the hell outta me, especially
that chestburster scene, the time where what was then left of the
Nostromo crew (Ripley, Parker, and Lambert) find out that Ash was
actually a robot, and those couple times when the alien popped out and
let out that extra-loud shriek.<br /><br />It was really scary stuff, but I didn&#x27;t scream.<br /><br />I read that people screamed, gasped, shrieked back in &#x27;79 when the film
was first out. I give it two big thumbs up.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a classics guy. I know lots of classic movies. They&#x27;re one thing
that I&#x27;ve brought myself up on, and when I compare classics like
&#x22;Alien&#x22; to some of the movies I&#x27;ve seen these days, it&#x27;s pretty hard to
enjoy today&#x27;s movies because most of the time I don&#x27;t really think
they&#x27;re fun or innovative. I make some exceptions, though.<br /><br />It&#x27;d be great if 20th Century-Fox put the film out again for it&#x27;s 30th
anniversary, but that&#x27;d only mean more money for them.
