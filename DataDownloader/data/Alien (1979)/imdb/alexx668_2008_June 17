Despite it&#x27;s legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror
movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the
serial killer that&#x27;s murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the
main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So,
nothing original, apart from that it&#x27;s set in outer space.<br /><br />Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note.
H.R. Giger&#x27;s design of the alien planet and the creature itself -
chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and
also Ash&#x27;s poetic reflection on the alien monster: &#x22;Its structural
perfection is matched only by its hostility.&#x22; &#x22;I admire its purity. A
survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.&#x22;<br /><br />And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it&#x27;s unclear what angle or
view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive
effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it&#x27;s the
morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end
where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting
it in outer space is probably the film&#x27;s center of gravity. The alien
creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying,
but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the
roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral
status of mankind.<br /><br />Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the
mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is
called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it&#x27;s own
purposes, has it&#x27;s chosen representative amongst the crew with the
robot Ash etc).
