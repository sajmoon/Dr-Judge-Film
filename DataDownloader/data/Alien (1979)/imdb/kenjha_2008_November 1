A strange being gets on board a spaceship and starts knocking off the
crew one by one. This is an old-fashioned thriller along the lines of
&quot;And Then There were None,&quot; except that the creepy mansion has been
replaced by a futuristic spaceship. It starts off rather slow, but
kicks into overdrive once the alien gets on board. The creature&#39;s
entrance is one of the most startling scenes in horror film history. In
only his second feature film, Scott&#39;s direction is superb, extracting
every ounce of suspense from the situation. Weaver gives a star-making
performance as the tough but feminine and sexy Ripley. The supporting
cast is fine, particularly Skerritt, Cartwright, and Kotto.
