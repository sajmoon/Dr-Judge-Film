I'm a teenager who grew up seeing movies such as Jurassic Park and
Resident Evil, but it was only recently that I discovered this true
classic that started it all. I love this movie and don't understand why
the teens of today don't embrace it the way they do Resident Evil. The
movie is slow paced and the special effects were amazing &quot;at the time&quot;,
but the story is ingenious and was based on an amazing book. I enjoyed
it so much that I was inclined to buy ALIENS a week later it is
enthralling and suspenseful. I definitely feel that this movie was
truly about the terror,suspense and the ALIEN. Sigourney Weaver played
an amazing role and possessed amazing character for the role. Igive her
performance and the ALIEN a 10/10.
