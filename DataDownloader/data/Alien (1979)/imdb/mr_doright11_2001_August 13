This is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. It's so original. The Alien itself is
the best special effects monster ever (don't shove that Predator crap in my
face either, it was good, but this blew it right off the map), and the huge
mining ship was very gloomy, but the most impressive piece of scenery was
the alien's home planet.<br /><br />Ridley Scott has directed the best Sci-Fi film ever! The whole movie is
very
suspenseful, and the scene where the creature breaks its way through the
guys chest is one of the goriest, yet most memorable scenes in movie
history.<br /><br />Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver made an excellent team trying to fight
off
the 8 foot killing machine. The Suspense is gripping, the violence is
subtle, but not too subtle, the Alien is frightening, and the surrounding
of
the distant future is bleak and almost gothic. All you Sci-Fi fans out
there
who haven't seen this, what are you waiting for, go rent it and you won't
be
disappointed! 9/10
