The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old
sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art
direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.<br /><br />A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related
influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the
world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment
inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the
film practically has no connection to any particular culture.<br /><br />The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R.
Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for
contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design
at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn
on one by one to form the letters of &quot;ALIEN.&quot;<br /><br />The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never
do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity.
