&quot;Alien&quot; is one of those films that has spawned numerous imitations, but none
have come close to the brilliance of their inspiration.  Definitely scary
and somewhat difficult to watch, the film deals with an outer-space crew
that accidently runs across an unknown organism that is bent on killing
everyone.  Sigourney Weaver became a super-star because of this film, but
she gets ample support from everyone else.  Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm, Yaphet
Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt all do amazing jobs with the
material.  Ridley Scott's direction keeps the audience tense and on edge
throughout the film's running time.  A really great film from the horror and
sci-fi genres.  4 stars out of 5.
