Is Director Ridley Scott's 1979 pop blockbuster a science fiction flick or a
horror film? It is,of course a uniquely successful and
ingeniously
arty fusion of the two genres,one that really changed the face of high-tech
Hollywood dread and launched a series of top-grossing sequels that started
off with James Cameron's &quot;Aliens&quot;(1986),and the two other
installments,&quot;Alien 3&quot;(1992),and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;(1997). This was
basically a haunted house movie in outer space,the interstellar fright fest
that started a trend toward futuristic grunge that shocked its audiences
more than 25 years ago,and one of the scariest films of its
era.<br /><br />It also introduced an extraordinarily and scary silmy monster that gave its
audiences a good shock out of their seats and gave a lot of them some very
frightening nightmares. Not since William Friedkin's &quot;The Exorcist&quot; has a
movie been so addictive in giving its audiences major chills,especially
within the boundaries of science fiction itself. Add in actress Sigourney
Weaver's career-launching performance,and you have
a grand classic modern-day science fiction shocker that is well worth the
revisit considering the scenes regarding actors Harry Dean-Stanton,
Tom Skerritt,Yaphet Kotto,and Veronica Cartwright. The re-release is worth
seeing,indeed,especially with the newly restored footage that adds in
additional scenes,a remixed digital sound and also tighter
editing.
