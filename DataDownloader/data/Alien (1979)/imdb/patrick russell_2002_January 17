What can you say about &quot;Alien&quot;? It's remained one of my all time favourite
films for the past twenty years. It is so visually sophisticated and
stunning that I still find it hard to believe that it was made in 1979.<br /><br />I love Ridley Scott's direction and the sheer atmosphere that the movie
creates - especially through its fantastic design and terrifying
storyline.
The acting is superb too - such strong characters developed in such a
short
time (i.e. before the cast is eaten!!).<br /><br />Much has been written about the primeval nature of Giger's design - the
alien planet with its eggs, and the creature itself with its strong sexual
overtones. &quot;Alien&quot; lends itself well to a feminist, as well as a Freudian
reading, both of which are plausible and enhance the enjoyment of the
film.<br /><br />I saw it, on a hot summer's afternoon, about three years after its general
release, at the Northfield Odeon cinema in West London. This was in the
days
when cinemas still had BIG screens. To add to the atmosphere, I was one of
only four or five others in the audience. After the show I accidentally
exited though the wrong door and found myself in a curving corridor behind
the screen! This was dimly lit, painted in matt black and had pipes
running
along the wall. It felt like I had done a &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and entered
the
spaceship!<br /><br />I must have watched &quot;Alien&quot; twenty times over the years and never get
tired
of it. I also always feel a sense of foreboding at what is about to
happen.
In my opinion, it's one of the greatest horror films ever
made.
