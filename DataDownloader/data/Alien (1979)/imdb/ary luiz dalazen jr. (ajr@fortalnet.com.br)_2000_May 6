It is difficult to believe that director Ridley Scott's frightening and
terrifying film was made in the seventies. Alien still possesses an
impressive vigor and strength, such as another classic that also seems so
fresh and vivid, Deliverance, a powerful adventure about four common people
who are hunted down by hillbillies in some river of Georgia. Alien places a
crew of astronauts being threatened by an implacable alien that kills each
one of them without mercy. The gigantic sceneries and the disturbing visual
(the scene in which Kane - John Hurt - explores a cave has a terrific
impact) were remarkable and brought innovation for movie making, because at
the time, the vision that Hollywood had of space was bright and clean (Star
Wars).This dark, tense visual helped to increase more fear and suspense to
the story. Ridley Scott's direction is outstanding  - he develops his
characters carefully, giving to every actor a chance to shine. Scott
develops real &quot;characters&quot;, and not fearless heroes, in a way this makes the
people inside the theaters to identify themselves with the protagonists.
Scott created memorable scenes,it's impossible to forget John Hurt's 
horrible, cruel death : alongside with Ned Beatty's rape in Deliverance,
this scene is one of the most gruesome things ever putted on the screen.One
of the greatest films of all time, I highly recommend Alien's DVD, Twentieth
Century Fox made an outstanding job with it, adding extras, trailers,
commentary and more. And don't forget to check Deliverance if you haven't
seen it yet.
