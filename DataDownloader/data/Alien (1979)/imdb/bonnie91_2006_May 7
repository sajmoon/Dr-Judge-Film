Alien is a terrifying experience in another world, a world in the
future and in another galaxy. As the title evidently infers, the movie
is about an Alien that torments the crew of a ship that makes a landing
on a planet from which a distress signal is being transmitted. What
follows is some of the best shocks in film history and plenty of
surprises that keep you guessing.<br /><br />The Alien creature itself is a nauseating thing to look at, from its
beginnings to adulthood, and has a way of doing things that are, well,
unorthodox. And it looks like Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and company are
pretty much out-powered from the get-go, although Ripley has a pension
for survival and uses all the tricks in the book.<br /><br />This movie has all the great special effects you would expect from a
good science fiction film set in outer space, some groundbreaking for
their time, which are still convincing today. For someone who hasn&#39;t
already seen this classic, the best description I could give you is
that it&#39;s a combination of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (some plot
points) and Star Wars (special effects) with a little bit of Halloween
thrown in for good measure (the Alien definitely has a psycho-killer
attitude).<br /><br />Lucky they made four of these, because after you see the first one
you&#39;ll be left wanting more!
