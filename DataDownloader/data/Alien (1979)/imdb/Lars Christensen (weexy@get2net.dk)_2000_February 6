* * * * * (5 out of 5)<br /><br />Alien <br /><br />Directed by : Ridley Scott, 1979<br /><br />Claustrophobic and effective horror favorite; still a shot in the arm to the
whole genre. <br /><br />Alien is a scary watch for even the most convinced horror fanatic. Standard
1950s formula (with touches of Kubrick`s 2001), but done with such flair and
vision that it became an instant classic. <br /><br />Sigourney Weaver delivers a top performance, as does John Hurt and Tom
Skerritt, but the real winner is director and designer Ridley Scott who
creates an environment so compelling and spellbinding it would not only
spawn three sequels but be considered an institution to this very day.<br /><br />The alien design was created by artist H.R. Giger and is legendary by
itself.<br /><br />Note : The art direction, cinematography and sound editing was
revolutionary, as was the camera angles and barren and bleak vision of the
future. Must remember to mention that the movie boldly had a woman as the
main character, another plus for this genre that only added to Alien's
credibility. The movie also went against mainstream as lead characters were
randomly killed, and this naturally only adding to the suspense (a technique
later copied in such diverse thrillers as Shoot To Kill, 1988, and Deep Blue
Sea, 1999).
