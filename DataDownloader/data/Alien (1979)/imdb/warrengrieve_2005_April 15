Ridley Scott stated when he did voice over commentary for Alien Legacy
that he would love to come back and do Alien 5 or 6. In this movie his
idea was to go back and trace the journey of origin that led the
alien's spacecraft landing ( crashing ) on planet. After the
nonsensical Alien vs Predator, his time is ripe for the one piece of
Alien history that would complete the puzzle. As the Alien series
progressed the creature metemorphisized from the original slow
cumbersome creature into a stealth like predator that moved like a cat.
We need to go back and find the origin and we need to start to pressure
Ridley Scott to get back at the helm and lead us once more into deep
space as an act of homage to Ripley and the crew of Nostromo. So start
writing and maybe we can get some sanity back to one of the greatest
movie series ever created
