I first was introduced to Alien at age 9 and ever since i have been hooked.
9 years on, I have seen it for the first time on the big screen (as well as
its equally brilliant sequel Aliens.<br /><br />Alien possesses a dignity about which seems to be lost in science fiction
films of current times, with atmosphere and story being placed above action
and gore.  Also, the best thing I find about Alien and Aliens is the fact
that the Aliens are still tall guys in rubber suits (not the obviously
computer animated aliens in Alien 3 and to a lesser extent
Ressurection).<br /><br />Personally, I find the original is still the best, followed by Aliens
(especailly Cameron's acknowledgement of Dan O'Bannon's earlier and very
funny film Dark Star where Boiler attempts the knife trick but to less
effect than Bishop has).  Alien Ressurection is number three...at first I
hated it but then it grew on me, mainly due to the fact that Junet directed
it (of whom I have great respect).<br /><br />I have mixed emotions over the rumours of a fifth installment, being that
fifth would be highly risky, as Resurrection illustrated.<br /><br />To those who haven't seen Alien, go to your video store immediately for a
film which the industry is yet to equal.
