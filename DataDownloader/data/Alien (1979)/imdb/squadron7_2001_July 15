This film was one of the best films I have ever seen. For the year, the
graphics and sounds are excellent. The actual film creates such a feeling
that you don't dare move into the dark, just in case! The acting is
brilliant and I can't think of a single thing wrong with this film.
Anything
whatsoever.
