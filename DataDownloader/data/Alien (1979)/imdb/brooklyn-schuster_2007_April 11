Alien is certainly a movie that keeps you satisfied till the very end.
The crew of the commercial ship &quot;Nostromo&quot; awakes from hypersleep as
they receive an SOS signal from a distant planet. They want to explore
the planet so they prepare for landing. Some of the Nostromo
crew-members leave their ship to do some investigations. They discover
a big amount of eggs by an unknown species. One of the eggs breaks and
the creature in it takes possession of one of the crew members. They
take him back to the Nostromo for medical researches but it&#39;s already
to late, the Alien has found it&#39;s host.......... At the beginning of
the movie everything seems very calm and harmless, until the Alien
appears! From this point the movie starts a claustrophobic horror trip
which takes your breath away. The most horrifying thing about Alien is,
that the Nostromo-crew is just a simple commercial crew, so they are
not armed well enough to face such dangerous creature. The concepts for
the Alien by H.R Giger fit perfectly and the acting pretty good too.
What else to say? 10 of 10 stars!
