'Alien' is one of the greatest movie ever made. Gathering one of the
best set of actors there has ever been, Ridley Scott manages to create
a frightening, dark, narrow, scary environment where we follow the crew
taken and killed, one by one, by the vicious creature they discover by
accident. Sigourney Weaver delivers such a good performance she should
have been nominated for awards, as does Ian Holm in his very truthful
role as a corrupted, humanoid robot.<br /><br />'Alien's nature isn't suitable for smaller youths (&lt;13) but anyone else
should, regardless of their usual opinion on action/horror, see this
movie that is a true landmark in film history. 10/10
