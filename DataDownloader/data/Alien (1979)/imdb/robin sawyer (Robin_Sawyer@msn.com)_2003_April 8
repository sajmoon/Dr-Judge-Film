I was very impressed with Alien. It was everything a perfect scary alien
movie should be! You have langauge, violence, and suspence.
period.<br /><br />My favorite part in this movie is when John Hurt is eating and then the
alien starts to move and then it wants out! It was very creative how the
alien just popped out his chest. Truly scary!!!!
