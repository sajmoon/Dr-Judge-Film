2007_July 1 
This film was historically significant for its work with special
effects and cinematography. It is not fun to watch, though. I found the
film slow-paced and unexciting. It might have been a shock to see an
&quot;alien&quot; on screen in 1979, but watching such a movie today is the film
equivalent of playing the first Mario games-- it&#39;s dated. We see
special effects every day now, not only in movies but in advertisements
on TV. This movie relies on its special effects, which are admittedly
well done, but are not enough to justify rating a movie highly in 2007.<br /><br />The Alien didn&#39;t scare me. More than anything, it grossed me out... but
it never induced horror or fright.<br /><br />I&#39;d suggest this film to the film professors, but not to my friends.
