What a great film, when i was a child my dad said that this film was to
scary to watch and that an alien burst through someones chest and it was
bloody. Well at the age of 9 who was i to go against my dad. So a couple of
years later i watched when i was about 13.  Back then i thought it was
alright.  But now i that i am twenty the chest bursting scene is one of the
best horror scenes in history.  A great film, especially the special edition
with the cut &quot;Dallas&quot; scene, which personally i thought should have been in
the final cut.
