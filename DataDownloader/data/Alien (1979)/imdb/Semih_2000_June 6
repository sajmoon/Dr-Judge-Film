In case you already didn't know, director Ridley Scott has made two movies
where Jerry Goldsmith's score was disrepspectfully cut up (as in Alien) or
completely thrown away (as in Legend).  
At any rate, Alien still is a classic. We have a female hero, we have
H.R.Giger's imagination, and we have one mean alien. The filmmakers wanted
to show an image of &quot;truckers in space&quot;, hence the blue collar looking
workers and chains, and an &quot;inside a factory&quot; like appearance. All this plus
the cinematography and direction gives this film a very grotesque realism
and clastrophobia. But only if they had kept Jerry Goldsmith's score as it
originally was composed. When will they ever learn?
