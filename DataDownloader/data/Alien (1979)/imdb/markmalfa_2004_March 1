you know,you can really pick apart the plot to any fictional movie,why did
this happen?? why didnt this happen? ad infinitum .....i think when you
look
at anything that way its always a disappointment..alien,released in
1979,was
a breakthrough movie,the style in which it was filmed was not seen up to
that point,both from a  cinematography standpoint as well as the
continuity
of the movie...but enough movie-eaze,at the time alien was released it
could
only be seen as a move forward stylisticly and you can see the influence
it
has had on science fiction movies in the last 25 years,i cant think of
many
science fiction movies or even horror movies other than the exorcist pre
1980 that were as scary or believable
