Right from its&#x27; opening credits this movie grabs your&#x27; attention. The
score, sets, and characters are as phenomenal as they are memorable.
Written by Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett, &#x22;Alien,&#x22; has become one of
my all time favorites. Even today it still stand the test of time
because of its&#x27; realism and originality. The sets are incredibly well
made and could make ones&#x27; jaw drop, while the score is probably one of
the most memorable of all time. However, the best part of the feature
is the alien. Instead of sticking with the typical little green men we
are confronted with something completely different. Something that&#x27;s
terrifying, and yet stunning at the same time. Unlike most of the
horror/ thriller movies of our time, &#x22;Alien,&#x22; uses the less is more
technique by showing less of the Alien. This allows our imaginations to
run wild with our worst nightmares. By showing less of the creature
director Ridley Scott makes it even more harrowing when the beast is
finally shown in all its&#x27; terrifying might towards the climax of the
movie. All in all it stands out as one of the greatest films ever made,
period.
