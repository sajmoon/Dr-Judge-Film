I think that the ultimate example of futility is the use of terms such
as overrated, simply because there are obviously no axiomatics at work
in the preferences of a film. I would also like to comment on how this
reviewer delved too deeply, for his own sake ,into the cytology of this
particular film. The intent put into the atmosphere of the film was
never to instill fear by usage of the character development, but rather
use the atmospheric moodiness to surround the viewer with a unsettling
claustrophobic dissonance from this realm. I cannot fathom why people
take even the most infinitesimal sum of time to dwell on a film they
just don't happen to like because of biased opinions, let alone put
their opinions out into the public.
