Weaver and crew are attacked by one un-Godly creature in outer space.
Shock-absorbing thriller turns out to be one-of-a-kind, with massive
amounts
of upsetting gore to counterbalance its slow pace. Makes for some
impressive
entertainment, with some fantastic surrealism by Ridley Scott, and the
most
memorable Alien creature ever seen.
