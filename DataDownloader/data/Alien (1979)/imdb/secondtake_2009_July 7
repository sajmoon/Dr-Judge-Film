Alien (1979)<br /><br />The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror Breed<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time,
but it&#x27;s also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie
even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite,
in the end--mostly because of some clich&#xE9;s and goofs in the acting and
dialog--although it has really great moments. And it&#x27;s a great way to
discover director Ridley Scott&#x27;s unique style.<br /><br />Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own
right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are
impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the
huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet
toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and
for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of
extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual
space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in
movies in general since the 1960s, is the director&#x27;s intention to keep
things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their
paychecks, and so on. <br /><br />This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the
earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people
would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It&#x27;s
fast, it&#x27;s scary, it&#x27;s gory, it&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s surprising. It&#x27;s
beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one
confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new
genre.<br /><br />I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge,
curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really,
truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really
scary, and it&#x27;s edited so quickly you won&#x27;t spend more than a minute on
any one scene that doesn&#x27;t quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been
the same since.
