1998_December 3 

Quite possibly the best science fiction movie of all time, certainly a
benchmark for the Genre and a film that still manages to stand the test of
time.
 From the opening (Quite literally!) sequence to the last scene, the ambiance
of the film and the changing moods are captured perfectly.
Even the old style displays and panels don't detract from the film, they add
to it - this is an ore freighter, not a top of the line
battlecruiser!<br /><br />Where this film scores most highly is in the characterisations of the crew -
the dialog flows so naturally it seems almost as if they are ad-libbing
rather than reciting.
Yaphet Kotto is particularly good at this, together with Harry dean Stanton
- a kinda deep space Abbott 'n Costello.
Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm and Veronica Cartwright (Who, incidentally was passed
over for the role of Ripley) are also excellent. Sigourney Weaver's
performance varies slightly, this was after all, her first major role, (Even
if a certain amount of Nepotism was involved) but occasionally we get
glimpses of a very competent actress.<br /><br />This, togeather with the latest film, stay closest to the Geiger-esque
visions of flesh/metal combinations which provoke such eerie reactions from
the viewer.
The chest bursting scene still retains its impact, even if the
chest-burster does not (Sooty!)- interesting bit of trivia. Veronica's
reaction was unfeigned - she was not told what was going to
happen.....<br /><br />The Director employs a technique that many of today's Horror maestro's
should learn from. He utilises the Audience's imagination extensively. When
Lambert is killed, you see the tail moving then the scene cuts to Ripley
hearing....that. You see nothing, but you KNOW what is happening and that
has more impact than any special effect could have.<br /><br />A lot of the film takes place in a dark, grimy, used atmosphere that you see
copied subsequently in such films as Bladerunner and the original
Terminator.<br /><br />All in all one of the very few films that I would unreservedly give 10/10
to, and watch again and again.<br /><br />Dan
