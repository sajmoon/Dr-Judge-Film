Alien is the first film in the Alien film franchise. It is a very good
film that combines aspects of the science fiction film with the Horror
Film. The result is a pretty scary film that also has some interesting
science fiction in it as well.<br /><br />The story is pretty easy to follow for the most part in this film. A
giant space ship with a group of seven people receives an SOS signal
from a planet so it lands. On the planet one member of the group gets
an alien embryo implanted in him that later turns into an alien that
starts to cause problems for the members on the ship.<br /><br />The Alien in this film is a classic. The way it looks with its long
head, evil looking mouth with a tongue that can shoot out like a
chameleons and also has a separate set of teeth at the end of its
tongue is classic. This is the best Alien species in any film in my
opinion. The alien gets to do a lot of evil and awesome things in this
film. However you do not really get a good view of him. But this works
in this film. If you see too much of him then it will not be as scary
when it pops out and attacks, which it does a lot in this film. Also he
pops out a lot in places where there are distractions that do not allow
for a good view of him. This aspect of how the alien is presented makes
for a very successful and scary technique that will frighten most
audiences. That is why this film is the most scary of all the alien
films. In other alien films you know that there are a lot of aliens
that are going to come out. In this film there is only one and you
never know when he will appear.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is awesome in this film. She really is a great actress
and this is the film that propelled her to greatness. SHe always plays
a convincing role and this is easily one of her best films. The rest of
the cast is OK.<br /><br />The setting is great. It takes place mainly on the huge freighter ship
that has a lot of places where the alien can hide in. This setting also
helps to make the film scary. Being on a huge ship that has an evil
alien on it in the middle of space is very scary. In space no one can
hear you scream either.<br /><br />This is a great science fiction/horror film that combines elements from
each film type to make a great horror film that contains science
fiction elements. Recommended strongly.
