Alien reviewed by Malte006 <br /><br />- &quot; In Space No One Can Hear You Scream.&quot; <br /><br />Directed by Ridley Scott (1979) <br /><br />After having written and worked on John Carpenters cult sci-fi Dark
Star, Dan O'Bannon decided that he would write another sci-fi space
movie. But this time the audience wouldn't laugh. He decided to work on
a script, he would once call Alien. After numerous re-writes the script
was sent from producer to producer until one finally wanted to make the
movie. After having talked to several (at the time) acknowledged and
experienced directors without really having been impressed with either
of their visions or ambitions with this movie, they finally offered the
new comer Ridley Scott a chance at this movie. Although he really have
not planned making a science fiction movie after his first movie, the
period movie The Duellists, but although he accepted to take up the
challenge. <br /><br />Somewhere in the future, the cargo ship The Nostromo and its crew are
heading home to earth after being on a work expedition. The suddenly
get a distress signal from a ship on an unknown planet, and they decide
to go down to investigate. On this planet they discover the very
mysterious ship and while they are looking around, one of the crew
members has gotten attacked by a strange kind of creature that has
smashed through his space helmet and locked itself on his face, and
putting him in a coma. He is brought back to the ship for examinations.
After some time he awakes from his coma, with no damage to see. But the
situation isn't quite so easy. I will not reveal more of the plot here.
Watch it! <br /><br />Alien is among my favourite movies and one of the few that I have
giving a perfect rating. It has all the elements a sci-fi horror needs.
It has suspense, shocking moments, perfect atmosphere and a creepy
mood; really great acting by the whole ensemble, perfect sound and
visual effects as is the cinematography and art-set decoration - and it
has some unforgettable scenes! <br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough! <br /><br />10/10
