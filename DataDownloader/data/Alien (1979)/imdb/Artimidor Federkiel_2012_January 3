Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x22;Alien&#x22; has easily advanced to the definitive modern day
horror classic by hiding the horror rather than showing it, thus
appealing primarily to the viewer&#x27;s imagination and omitting
in-the-face special effects. The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in
all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still
serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of
being masterfully directed. &#x22;Alien&#x22; is a perfectly slow paced
composition of shadows, noises, musical cues, a film of claustrophobic,
tense atmosphere oozing dread and despair, all this creating suspense
in the most accomplished Hitchcockian sense: The film provides a
scenario where the unknown danger is as unpredictable as it is certain
that it does strike.<br /><br />Aside from its directorial brilliance, &#x22;Alien&#x22; of course also has one
of the most innovative monster designs in movie history to offer (H.R.
Giger&#x27;s incredibly beautiful otherworldly creature), another excellent
Jerry Goldsmith score, exceptionally strong characters and an
outstanding female lead in Sigourney Weaver - and last but not least
there&#x27;s that perfect script, which makes a relatively simple idea into
an unforgettable story. Put in three words: First rate horror.
