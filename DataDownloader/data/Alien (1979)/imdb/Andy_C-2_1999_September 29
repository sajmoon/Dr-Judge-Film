1999_September 29 

In its time this was the most original sci-fi flick for
years,
I have never waited with so much anticipation for a movie to appear on TV.
The plot is well known - a spacecraft picks up a distress call and the
crew
are awoken from hypersleep to investigate. What they find of course is a
nasty little SOB alien that takes on the crew single-handed
(clawed?).
An excellent cast, my only complaint when I view the film now is the
rather
mumbled dialogue, giving the impression that some of it was
ad-libbed.
Most of the actors are well known; Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto and John
Hurt
for instance. Ironically it was the relative newcomer Sigourney Weaver who
became the biggest star.
More or less a ghost story set in outer space - in that something scary is
attacking people, but we never quite see it until the end. Highly
recommended.
