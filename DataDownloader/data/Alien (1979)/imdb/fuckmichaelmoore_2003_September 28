Many people prefer the action packed sequel Aliens (a great film in its
own
right), but this suspenseful, atmosphere driven thriller is just as good
on
its own merits.  Emotionally detached, even slightly Kubrickian at times
(the opening scene, for example) the films dark tone and detatched
characters make the whole thing effectively creepy.  The tracking scene in
the tunnels is one of the most suspenseful moments ever staged on film.
The
alien itself has a very slick, unique design that's become iconic for a
reason.  There are good performances all around and a great one from Ian
Holm.  Ridley Scott's best work beside Blade Runner, a must
see.
