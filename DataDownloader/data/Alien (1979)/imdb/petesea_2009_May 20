If only the crew listened to Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s Ripley and followed
quarantine protocol, they may have avoided all this fuss. Ian Holm&#x27;s
science officer Ash was the one who let the away team onboard &#x96; what&#x27;s
his problem? The answer is quite an unexpected twist.<br /><br />The Alien is, unfortunately for the crew, a hungry killing machine
whose &#x22;blood&#x22; is a highly corrosive acid. The Alien&#x27;s &#x22;coming out&#x22; is
one of the classic movie scenes of all time.<br /><br />Ridley Scott does a great job directing the crew of the Nostromo which
is really a tugboat taking a load of mineral ore from the outer reaches
of space back to Earth. The Nostromo looks very much like a set from
Kubrick&#x27;s 2001.<br /><br />A not so subtle subtext of this film is corporate greed. The crew is
very concerned about getting their &#x22;share&#x22; and what to do to get a full
instead of a half-share. Ash&#x27;s motivation was greed as well.
