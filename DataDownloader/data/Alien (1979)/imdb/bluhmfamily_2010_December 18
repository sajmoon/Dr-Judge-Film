If you try to see how Sci-fi and a Horror movie would look like if they
were mixed together, you would get Alien, everything about this movie
kicks butt with no way to explain it whatsoever. This movie also shows
that it takes place in 2037, the world probably just changed a little
bit though.<br /><br />So the movie starts out with a space-mining crew waking up from years
of rest, their ages have stayed the same. The crew find an unknown
planet; they go there in hopes of finding iron ore. One of the men
finds a room filled with mysterious eggs, he looks into one and
suddenly a creature called a Facehugger clamps onto him. The crew
studies the guy and cut one of the Facehugger&#x27;s legs as it&#x27;s acid blood
drips down the decks. Later the Facehugger is off of the guy&#x27;s face.<br /><br />Later, the guy goes in pain as an Alien Chestburster comes out of him
and runs to the lower levels of the ship. Later when a guy finds the
member Ripley&#x27;s cat, the fully-grown alien comes up behind him and
strikes him with it&#x27;s inner-jaw. Ripley and the crew decide to hunt the
alien down and kill it. The alien eventually kills the other crew
members leaving only Ripley left.<br /><br />Ripley, thinking that the alien is still on the self-destructing ship,
get&#x27;s into a smaller ship and flies into space as the main ship
explodes in the distance. Ripley prepares for another long sleep period
until she finds out that the alien is on the ship.<br /><br />Ripley acts fast as she puts a astronaut suit on so the alien does not
get D.N.A in her. She blows the alien out into space and burns it with
the thrusters. Ripley then prepares for another years of sleep.
