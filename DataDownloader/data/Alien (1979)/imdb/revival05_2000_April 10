<br /><br />**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes**<br /><br />I must say that this movie is SO, SO great! The script is genious. First
building it up slowly, and carefully, nothing really happens it is only a
great fog and a mysticfeeling lies over everything. Then one person gets
injured and the caos startsspreading. Slowly, the crisis gets more and more
a fact until there is only one person on the ship left. NO OTHER MOVIE has
had this great combination before. It just takes my breath away. None of
the
other movies had this magic in it. Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but
it
was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and
''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining. But to
put it in another way. Many people who loved the three sequels of the movie
might just get really dissapointed. This is not at all like the other
movies. But if you can accept this kind of slow movies you will love it!
