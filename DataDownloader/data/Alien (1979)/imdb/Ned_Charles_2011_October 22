I watched &#x22;Alien&#x22; a while back and was impressed by it, but this
viewing definitely takes the cake and now it&#x27;s among my top favorite
Sci-fi/horror films. One of the things I&#x27;ve always loved most about the
film was how well it develops its characters. You could tell that the
actors developed a real rapport on set and it shows. They have great
chemistry and all them do a fine job of making us care about their
fate. Unlike a lot of other horror films, all the kills in this film
actually had an emotional impact on me thanks to these actors, and by
the end, I was speechless. The first time I watched the film, I didn&#x27;t
really allow myself to be fully absorbed into it, but this is a film
that demands your attention at all times in order to get the full
effect. When the alien jumps out of Kane&#x27;s body, it&#x27;s one of the most
shocking and iconic moments in movie history, and the tone of the film
is truly set from that point on.<br /><br />The film is also a genuinely frightening experience and its use of
sound is practically unparallelled in the horror genre. It constantly
plays with your emotions and your reflexes, testing you and constantly
making you think you&#x27;re safe until something pops out, which was
brilliantly executed with a cat alone, but the scares with the alien
are even more cleverly executed. The atmosphere of the film is cold and
extremely mysterious. The movie is flawlessly paced and shows that
great build-up is key to developing a pitch-perfect second half, which
is exactly what it does. Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s fantastic score only helps
the film by that point on. Ridley Scott&#x27;s direction has never been
better (except in Blade Runner), and although the sequel would take the
&#x22;bigger and more action-packed&#x22; approach, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the
original film a lot more. It goes beyond genre conventions, crushes all
its rivals and is one hell of an experience for the senses.
