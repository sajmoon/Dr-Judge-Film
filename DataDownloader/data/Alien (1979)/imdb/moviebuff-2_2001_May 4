&quot;Alien&quot; was the first film in a sci-fi series of movies that have become
popular the world over. That is the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot;. This movie features
Sigourney Weaver in her first major, and immortal, role as Ellen Ripley, and
it made her a star. It is the role she was born to play. The characters are
interesting, my favorites being Ash and Parker. My favorite scene is the
infamous and oft-copied chest-bursting scene, where an alien bursts out of
Kane's [John Hurt] stomach. That is what made this movie a classic. It's
probably the goriest moment ever put on film. My one problem with &quot;Alien&quot; is
the sometimes slow pacing. Don't get me wrong, I like suspense just as much
as I like action, but the film can drag in some places. Despite this one
flaw, &quot;Alien&quot; is a very good sci-fi horror/thriller.
