I tell you, I was scared s***less when I first saw this movie back in 1993.
Of course, I was only seven at the time, but that just goes to show you that
even little 7 year olds have guts to watch horror movies like this. Even
today, I still can't watch this movie alone. The special effects and the
music is what really makes you scared. That, and the fear shown on the
character's faces. <br /><br />What makes this movie really great, is that a woman, not a man, plays the
hero. And Segorney Weaver does a magnificent job of playing Ellen Ripley,
the woman who manages to escape the evil Aliens and save her life. Ripley is
a complex character, one who does what she's told, yet is able to put her
fears behind her, and get the job done. That takes courage, something not
even macho men have. The movie is one of the best sci fi movies ever made,
surpassed only by The Matrix. I highly recommend this movie. Watch it at
night, and definatly not alone..................................
