Every time I see this I think of my initial reaction to it at the
cinema in 1979. I hadn&#39;t seen anything quite like it back then, I dare
say that applied to most of the audience too &#150; I thought it a steely
cold classic, with a simple plot wrapped around a complicated future.
Real computers were thankfully invented afterwards because the use and
therefore the inevitable over-use of cgi cartoonery would have ruined
the whole point of the film.<br /><br />Team of space miners get nosey and investigate signals coming from a
nearby planet &#150; too late it turns out not to be a distress signal but a
stay-away signal. The menacing external and then internal shots of the
grounded gargantuan alien spaceship in the storm are still impressive.
The result of their nosiness is a ruthless alien lifeform gets on board
their spaceship and causes mindless havoc, the implication being of
course that they would carry it with them to eventually doom Mankind.
The corollary is incomplete as we don&#39;t learn whether the aliens are of
different politics or religion, although we can see for ourselves that
no mercy must be shown to merciless Evil. Will aliens ever be clever
enough to swear an oath of allegiance via a universal translator to
gain entry before embarking on their savagery? Back to the cinema: the
scene where the bloody gibbering penis lookalike dashed out of John
Hurt had the audience unintentionally rocking with laughter, however
when Dallas confronted the alien in the air vents I jumped a clear foot
out of my seat. You feel so daft! But in this dark and cold world
everything is so believable and most things beyond criticism or
mockery, except maybe as the Rifftrax version I&#39;ve just watched pointed
out, just how many times do you have to save a cat in a picture?<br /><br />There&#39;s plot twists and turns to the very end: it must be one of the
best of its kind even with faults caused by technological limitations,
simple but unique and worth watching over and over again.
