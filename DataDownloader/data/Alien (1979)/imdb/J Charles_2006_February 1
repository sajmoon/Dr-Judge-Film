I don't get the enthusiasm for this movie. As of today it's the #62
movie of all time. I found it had some rather dry boring parts that
didn't add to the story or to the mood. Cinematography was amateurish.
Plot was straightforward without any interesting points to it. No real
character development. I just kept waiting for the beast to kill them
all. I didn't really care for any of the characters. A suspenseful
movie only works when you actually care about what becomes of the main
characters and I didn't feel any warmth to this movie at all.<br /><br />This movie hasn't aged very well either. Looks very 80's-ish. I found
Sigourney Weaver's hair to be scarier than the Alien itself.
