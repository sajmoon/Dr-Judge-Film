alien remains one of the masterpieces of a crowded genre
unrelenting in it's plot and brilliant in it's claustrophobic terror it
bears repeated viewing and needless to say giger's alien design remains the
benchmark by which others are judged
finally of course it's now presented in a wonderful dvd
package
a perfect 10.
