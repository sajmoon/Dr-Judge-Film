The first Alien franchise I saw was resurrection in the 1997, and I
always craved to see what led to it.<br /><br />In 1979, with the aid of great cinematography Ridley Scott directed the
first Alien film, and I have to be honest after you get over the first
50 minutes, the movie had all it takes to make you quiver. You may not
appreciate the graphics but I can tell you one thing, they pulled it
off.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver, I just have to say, what a classic actress she is,
she made sure the facial expressions and the reactions were enough to
make you the viewer just wish she quits already.<br /><br />I have to give this movie thumbs up for execution, nice story build up
all leading to the inevitable, an Alien on board the ship.<br /><br />Ian Holm played Ash, which with the help of the editor, pulled off some
classic film trick to convince you of his predicament.<br /><br />The scenes that had the alien, had to be done with lighting and camera
work to convince you of the threat. In this present day this is done
with acting and the alien present introduced later on. The actors do a
lot of work in the area of performance to convince you that they are
scared of what they cannot see, of what will be CG included in post
production.<br /><br />But back then the cinematographer and the director had to find away to
convince you that the figure you are seeing is threatening, what I have
to say Ridley Scott did a fine job of.<br /><br />The plot is simple, a crew is sent on a science exploration in space,
they pick up a signal and divert to see what it was (they didn&#x27;t really
want to but it was against their contract), only for one of the crew to
get infected by an Alien, they bring him onboard to help him and all
hell breaks loss.<br /><br />If you are a fan of seeing things done back in the day, try this for
size. If you are not&#x85;, they were ahead of their time with this one so
you won&#x27;t feel taken for a ride.<br /><br />All in all, what are you waiting for reading this to the end, go get it
and watch.
