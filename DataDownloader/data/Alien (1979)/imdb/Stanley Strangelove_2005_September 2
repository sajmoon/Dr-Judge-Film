Director Ridley Scott and writer Dan O'Bannon came up with something
very special in Alien. A combination of horror and sci-fi that works on
many levels. Introducing Sigourney Weaver in a role she would reprise
in the Alien sequels. The mining space ship Nostromo is redirected on
its way home to Earth to a planet to investigate a mysterious signal. A
small crew lands on the desolate planet and one of them is attacked.
They return to the ship but unknowingly they've brought an alien life
form on board. The alien creature and it's manifestations are by weird
sculpture and painter H.R. Giger. What sets this film apart is the
incredible acting and characters. Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerrit have
good chemistry. Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and
Yaphet Kotto are all individual and outstanding in their roles. The
visuals and effects in Alien are top notch. This movie is a perfect
example that a great film can be made with a sci/fi/horror theme. Not
to be missed.
