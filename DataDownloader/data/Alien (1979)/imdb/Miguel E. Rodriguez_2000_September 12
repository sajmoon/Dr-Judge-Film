I'm afraid I have nothing new to offer for you avid readers of these
comments.  I just wanted to add my two cents to the veritable goldmine of
praise heaped upon this well-deserving classic.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is one of the last great classics of the seventies.  Even today, it
doesn't seem dated.  Okay, the special effects for the climactic explosion
look a little old...more like time-lapse photographs of moldy bread.  But
the story holds up.  That's about it.  Good night.
