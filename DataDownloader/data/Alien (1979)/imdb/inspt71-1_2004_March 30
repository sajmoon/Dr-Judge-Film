<br /><br />     This movie is a good Thriller and a great start to a great trilogy,
until Alien Ressurection anyway. This movie is great, it's Oscar winning
special effects are great and the characters are great as well. Signorney
Weaver is excellent for her role and Tom Skeritt makes a good team leader.
Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Katto are funny at times and bring some laughs
early in the movie. The Alien design by H.R. Giger is great and would
certainly scare me if it snuck up on me in an airduct. If there is one thing
about this that I didn't like, was the scene where the Nostromo blows up. It
looks like a planet is exploding. I thought that they would change this in
the Director's Edition but that didn't change the movie any. This is a good
movie to show on Halloween night and scare you. Watch this and get
scared!
