Ah, here we are....the dregs of the IMDb reviews, where teenagers and
20-somethings who have rarely seen a film made before 1980 tell us how
a masterful film like Alien is boring and slow..These poor mentally
crippled creatures know no patience, know nothing about the craft of
cinema except what their short attention spans can consume in junk food
bytes (pun intended).<br /><br />Ignore these little trolls...Alien is a landmark classic of cinema with
it&#x27;s horror suspense and extraordinary visual design (Cobb vs Giger) -
a film that still haunts the imagination all these years after i first
saw it as a teen. Like 2001, the images are unforgettable, a cinema
experience you can become completely immersed in.<br /><br />The late 70&#x27;s, my youth, were in many ways were an incredible rebirth
of science fiction and horror cinema, and it&#x27;s worth noting how Alien
in a sense bookended Lucas&#x27; fantasy reinvention of sci-fi with Star
Wars. Ridley Scott&#x27;s great vision in bringing all these elements
together in Alien and Blade Runner literally changed the course of
fantasy films alongside Lucas&#x27;.<br /><br />Many comments here also focus on comparing Alien to Aliens, which is
ridiculous..It&#x27;s simple...Alien is a horror masterpiece, and Aliens is
a brilliantly executed action film using Alien as it&#x27;s inspiration.<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t like Alien, you don&#x27;t like films...it&#x27;s that brilliant.
