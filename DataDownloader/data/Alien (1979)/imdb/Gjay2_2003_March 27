to me, this is a film which, other than the haircuts, just doesn't age. The
first film of the alien saga is easily the best. Or at least, the scariest.
Pitting one alien against a crew of seven is a great set-up for some
horrible and gruesome battles. But instead, it takes it further and draws
the war out, singling out certain members as they leave the crowd, to face
the creature on their own. It takes a good while before the action begins
but all the build up it what makes the end result so utterly chilling. As
soon as one of the main characters &quot;releases&quot; the alien, you know it's only
going to get better from there. The sound effects in this movie are the best
use of noise ever put on screen. The wind effects, the spaceships, the
alien, the computers all have memorable sounds, and the creature design for
the alien has become legendary. Undoubtebly one of the scariest films ever
made.
