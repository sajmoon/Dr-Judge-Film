Alien is, without a doubt, overrated. But there's plenty of suspense, and
the last twenty minutes or so are great.
But good things aside..this movie almost made me fall asleep!
There was way too much film wasted in the production of this
movie..
Thank goodness for the fast-forward button.<br /><br />6.0 out of ten.
