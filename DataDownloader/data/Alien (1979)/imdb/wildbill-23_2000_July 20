Ridley Scott scored a mammoth tale about seven crew members aboard a
interstellar cargo ship that are terrorized by an alien creature.  If you
have never seen it before, don't see the sequels.  The original film is very
tense from beginning to end.  Solid screenplay and acting.  Superb set
design and special effects.  The film is best viewed in wide screen format. 
A winner! score: 9 (out of 10).
