Has there ever been a more useless movie cat than Jones on the Nostromo?
Diverts the attention of the crew who are searching for the alien and then
lures Brett to his death. Spends the rest of the movie fannying around
doing
nothing before forcing Ripley into a late risky move to save him....again.
Great work, puss.
