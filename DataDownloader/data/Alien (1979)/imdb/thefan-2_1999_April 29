1999_April 29 

The sick claustrophobic dread, the blinding
disco-era strobes and deafening noise, the
machine-like creatures, the organic-looking
machines, the face-hugger, the chest-burster,
H.R. Giger's nightmarish monster (and what
*was* it doing to Veronica Cartwright, anyway?),
Jerry Goldsmith's neoromantic score segueing
to Howard Hanson's 2nd Symphony at the end,
that darned cat -- &quot;Alien&quot; is The Perfect Movie.
James Cameron's sequel was a better film
in almost every way, but it will never make the
midnight cult circuit, as Ridley Scott's history-
making shocker has done.  Cameron wants
you to see his movie three times at the theater,
tell all your friends how great is is, and buy
the video the day it comes out. That's why
we love him, but it's also one of his limitations.
By contrast, when asked what effect he wanted
&quot;Alien&quot; to have on the audience, Scott replied:
&quot;Like someone pounding a nail into your head.&quot;
