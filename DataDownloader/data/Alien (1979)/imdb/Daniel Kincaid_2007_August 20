&quot;Alien&quot; is Ridley Scott&#39;s acclaimed horror science-fiction film about a
killer alien on a spaceship. It features excellent special effects and
scenes and a clever use of lighting techniques. Sigourney Weaver is
strong as the film&#39;s lead and Ian Holm is memorable as the ship&#39;s
science officer. John Hurt is also in the film as the ship&#39;s executive
officer, but is underutilized in the role.<br /><br />Where &quot;Alien&quot; suffers is in its story or more appropriately its lack
of. Characterization in the film is limited and there is only one
interesting twist in the plot, which was enjoyable, but represented
only a small part in the film. The story is quite run-of-the-mill and
barely developed beyond the fact that there is an alien bent on
indiscriminately killing members of the ship&#39;s crew. The lack of story
development made &quot;Alien&quot; seem long and mostly tedious.
