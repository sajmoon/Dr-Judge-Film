When I first watched Alien I simply did not have the attention span to
sit through it. That&#39;s the same story as pretty much every one-star
review you&#39;ll ever read. They, and likewise I when I first watched it,
watch the first hour and realize nothing has happened and turn it off.
I remember saying, &quot;Who can open up a movie in such a boring way?&quot; But
after turning it off after the first hour, I came back later and
finished it up&#151;and was amazed at the pure intensity of the last half
hour. I didn&#39;t realize what I was supposed to realize in the first five
minutes: everyone on this ship is already in a life-or-death situation.
That is why it is called a survival horror movie. That&#39;s the pure
genius of the slow opening. That&#39;s what I and all the people who think
this movie is boring missed. Luckily, after finishing the last 30
minutes the first time I realized this and watched it again. And again.<br /><br />The atmosphere and feelings of true desolation were a perfect execution
of the brilliant tagline, and to this day I&#39;m hard pressed to think of
another movie that rivals Alien in pure doom atmosphere. But with doom
always comes melodrama, and the casting and acting both diminish it.<br /><br />Alien also succeeds in perfectly placing the two shock moments. It
knows how to use them to their most effective potential, with flawless
execution, by using the slow pace to deceive you. If you have not seen
this movie or any of the spin-offs, do not let anyone ruin these
moments for you.<br /><br />But simply the main standing point that sets this movie apart from
every other movie about aliens is the creature itself. In modern
movies, creatures are thrown in with little thought or design, and
Alien may be the single only creature film I&#39;ve ever seen with a
creature is not laughable in any way. Instead of stooping the stupid
idea of making a humanoid alien that can talk, think, Alien defies the
clich&eacute;s by creating the most perfect instrument of death ever filmed,
ever thought of, and has never yet been rivaled.<br /><br />I don&#39;t what else there is for me to say. Alien is a true survival
horror movie that not only started the sub-genre but puts all others in
that sub-genre to shame. There are no pointless sex scenes to make you
realize you&#39;re watching yet another tiresome, typical Hollywood horror
movie. No pointless subplots or gimmicky action scenes. Alien is true,
simple terror that copies real life rather than copy other movies to
make money.
