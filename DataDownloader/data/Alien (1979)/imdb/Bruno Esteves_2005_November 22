As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. I'm just a
regular movies fan, with any technical expertise what so ever, my
opinion is only based in my sensibility and emotions like any other
people while watching a movie, enhanced with some trivia knowledge
though.<br /><br />What really fascinates me in Alien, as a Sci-Fi movie, is its realism.
All the visuals and contexts are truly believable, and you actually
look at it as a highly probable prospective of how mankind will be in
the XXII century.<br /><br />We can notice some aspects of the human nature that, unfortunately,
will never cease to exist, like greed, latent conflicts in high
pressure situations, corporative lack of scruples, even though evil is
personalized on the robot Ash.<br /><br />The settings are amazing as well, beginning with the spaceship, and its
sense of realism becomes from its nature, a towing vehicle from a big
corporation, a commercial vessel, not a scientific expedition with the
purpose of exploring new worlds. Don't get me wrong, I'm a major
Kubrick fan, I have almost all his movies on DVD, but 2001 is
fascinating in a NASA point of view, and come on, it's 2005 and Man
hasn't even got close to Mars, even less to Jupiter. 2001 is great for
its visual beauty, almost poetic with the Strauss' waltzes, and it
surely revolutionized the Sci-fi vision, but is far more dated than
Alien.<br /><br />So, regardless some devices, like computer terminals and navigation
screens, that are slightly dated, all the rest of the props and sets
are very well conceived, even for today's standards. Little details
contribute to this, like the woodpecker figure on the mess table.<br /><br />The main conclusion is that's not necessary a CGI overload to make a
good Sci-Fi movie, and Alien is the proof of it. I'm sure if Alien was
to be produced nowadays, certainly it would lose a great deal of its
realism, that resides mainly in it's rawness, pace, darkness, humanity,
and sets conception, that present Hollywood standards, and perhaps
audience's demands, would suppress.<br /><br />Just another remark: isn't it surprising that many of the #250 IMDb's
top movies weren't acclaimed in their release years, especially by the
Academy Awards? Alien is one of them. &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; and
&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are great movies, still remembered, but &quot;Norma Rae&quot; or
&quot;All That Jazz&quot; are hardly in Alien's league, as far as contributions
to the cinema history are concerned.
