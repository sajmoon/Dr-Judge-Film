...and only !<br /><br />I saw him on a video tape when I was 14 years old, and it was a true
life experience !<br /><br />All things in this movie seems to be perfect: the story, the actors,
the special effects, the atmosphere,the monster, the set and of course
the Ridley Scott's masterliness.<br /><br />This is the most fearsome crossing between science fiction and terror:
here we found the space travel, the life in space, one of the most
beautiful space ship ( the Nostromo ), the most deadly extra
terrestrial creature, a real feeling of the gap between the human life
form and an inhuman one...<br /><br />The characters are very engaging, and they are very well written: just
a few line of dialog in the beginning and you understand who's who.
Sigourney Weaver ( Ripley) is one of the first female leading role in
that kind of movie, and she knocked me out ! Her performance is very
well supported by Yaphet Kotto (Parker) and Ian Holm (Ash). All lines
of dialog are effective, and none of them is useless (they really LIVE
in their vessel...) , the images and the shots are amazing and powerful
( Thanks M. Scott ), and the &quot;alien&quot; is monstrous and....fascinating (
Thanks M. Giger ).<br /><br />If you really want something different, see this stunning movie, and
let your mind escape in the void of space...
