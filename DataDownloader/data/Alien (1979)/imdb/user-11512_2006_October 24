how do you write about a masterpiece that was released before you were
even born? well you start by watching the film many many times and when
you&#39;ve watched it a few times too many and your still scared, well you
have yourself a sci-fi/horror classic. H.R. Giger&#39;s exotic and modern
Gothic designs are what bring the setting of this movie to life. The
viewer can&#39;t help but feel uncomfortable upon the sight of all that has
to do with the alien in an otherwise bland factory-like merchandise
transportation ship in outer space. It is a beautiful and uncomforting
contrast, this coupled with the seemingly blue collaredness of the
actors, it became easy for me to relate this to my parents and their
friends, just people doing there job. What befalls them is an
incredible foreign and never before encountered evil and predatory life
force. With memorable scenes galore from this movie, its no surprised
it turned 3 sequels, 4 if you include that outrageous AVP.Ay how this
film defined what most horror movies of the legendary horror decade of
the 80s. It set a new precedent of fear and accomplishment, using
settings, camera angles, and decent acting and props, rather than just
a man in a cape or some face paint and extra hair to scare the
audience. Only a few films before this employed the deranged and
bizarre concepts to scare rather than the what i call cheap scares,
which is the scare achieved just for a temporary and quick jump or
scream by the audience, those films all classics in their time and
today include: Psycho (1960), Last House on The Left (1972), The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Carnival of Souls (1962), Halloween (1978),
Night of the Living Dead (1968), and Dawn of the Dead (1977)
