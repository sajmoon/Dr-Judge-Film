1999_August 14 

This movie is very slow, very dull and very boring. After waiting half an
hour for the movie to start after many long and dull shots at the area, the
movie begins to move. After lots and lots of boring visuals, the story
begins to move, though never takes off. Personally I hated the movie and has
been given a vote of one by me in the user vote.<br /><br />I don't recommend you see it, but it's vote of 8.2 by other viewers might
suggest otherwise. My personal opinion is that it was made in 1977 so people
have just voted for it as a classic.<br /><br />It deserves nothing as a classic.<br /><br />No stars
