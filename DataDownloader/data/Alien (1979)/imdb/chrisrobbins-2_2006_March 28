Alien is by far one of the best movies ever made because of 2 reasons.
1 It's very intense and 2 it's very scary. This is one of those movies
that the tagline does fit: In space no one can hear you scream. When i
saw this movie at the age of 8 I was so scared I had to sleep with my
parents for a long month, now i'm a huge fan of not only the movie, but
of the series. I have got alien, aliens, alien3, and alien
resurrection. The best is aliens ( alien 2) because it's got Bill
Paxton and if there where more lines for him it could be a comedy. Yes
alien is one of those movies that is nearly impossible to re-create. I
am a fan of horror, sci-fi, and action. Ridley Scott you put all my
favorite genres in one big amazing movie called alien and I will never
forget this masterpiece. This movie gets my vote for a major 10 out of
10. I will never forget this movie. It should'not even be called a
movie, more like a blessing. Thank you god. Overall: Major 10/10
