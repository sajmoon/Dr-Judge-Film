This movie sounds like it is very scary and it is.  The reason for a nine is
because the special effects are great and for a nineteen seventy nine movie
its hard to even accomplish that.  Some of the parts are grose.  But it
makes you wonder who is going to make it out before it does.  By the end of
the movie you knew there was going to be a sequel.  No complaints
here.
