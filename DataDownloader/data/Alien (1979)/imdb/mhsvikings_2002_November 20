This is one of the best movies of all time. You don't have to like Science
Fiction or Horror and this movie will still get to you. The ensemble cast is
excellent and the plot moves along perfectly. Ridley Scott has made a
masterpiece of Science Fiction and Horror here, don't miss it. A must have
for everyone's home video collection. 5 out of 5.
