Probably the best done alien film there is. From the outset you can feel
the
tension growing. From the music to the camera work the feel of the film is
transfered to the viewer giving a real sense of empathy with the crew of
the
Nostromo. Many people I know pitch Aliens as the best of the series due to
the gun/explosive quota. I believe that the two films complement each
other
in that the first is dramatic and building and the second is in your face.
After the first film you know what to expect so it is good that the second
films attacks the story from a different angle.
