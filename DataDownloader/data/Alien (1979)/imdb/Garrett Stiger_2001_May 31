Through its magnificent sets, story, and characters, Alien would influence
many science fiction films that would follow it; though few would ever equal
it. <br /><br />Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay is good and very original. The
one drawback is the minor subplot involving Ian Holm's character, Ash, which
is fairly interesting but I always felt that it bogged the film down.<br /><br />Overall, the cast is pretty good. Tom Skerritt does a nice job at
underplaying his character of Captain Dallas. Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean
Stanton, and Ian Holm also give commendable performances.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's direction is phenomenal. His attention to detail is
astounding. He takes full advantage of his sets, music, and lighting to make
the film as eerie as possible.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's subtle musical score is great; it is very effective and
quite ominous and unnerving. <br /><br />The art direction and set decoration in Alien is absolutely terrific. The
sets are large and yet they have a very claustrophobic feel.<br /><br />The special effects for the alien creature are quite convincing. The
full-grown alien is not shown in prolonged shots or whole-body shots. This
is a wise decision on the filmmakers' part; had the alien been shown in full
body shots it would have given the impression of someone in a suit and so it
wouldn't have been as convincing. <br /><br />Alien is a worthy addition to anyone's film library.
