2003_May 6 

Alien, the movie, by far outranks its later versions, its timeless, the
craft may look like it came out of a 1970's, but this is surpassed by its
plot and story. In many ways it is another '2001: A space odyssey' for
the
space generation. Ian Holm makes a fantastic android and Sigourney Weaver
seems to enjoy the role, after all, it made her subsequent career. Still
has
people glued to the television even now, a true sci-fi horror. 6 out of 5
stars from me.
