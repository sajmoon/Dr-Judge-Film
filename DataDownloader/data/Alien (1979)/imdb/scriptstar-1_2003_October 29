Yikes! Sccccreeeeeaaaammm! Oh, no! As I slowly parted my fingers over my
face and then quickly back again...this is one scarey movie. No, I'm not
talking Scarey Movie 3, TCM, 28 Days, Freddy vs Jason, or Gigli, I'm
speaking of the scariest movie of all time. Alien. Spooky scarey - low
light, eerie music, and those awful creatures. Just when you think it's
gone...boo! It's back! Acid city. No not that kind of acid. We're talking
drippy, saliva, alien acid that deforms faces and bodies. Aliens that like
to use humans as hosts...and then pop out of stomach and scoot across the
floor like a friggin roach. No not that kind of roach...the bug kind.
Killing one by one has been done before
(recently in Identity), but it was Alien (1979) that started it all followed
by six years later by Alien II (a classic), but not as scarey - eerie scarey
as the original Alien. In a theatre everyone
can hear you scream. In space...if you're alone with an
Alien...well...
