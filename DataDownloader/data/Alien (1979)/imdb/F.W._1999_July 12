Alien: How can one review their favorite movie. I can begin by saying
H.R.Giger (alien designer and artist) is brilliant. He created the most
original and frightening creatures ever. The fact that the movie always
hides the alien in the shadows made it even more frightening. Suspense has
always been a hard thing for films to truly accomplish for me, but Alien
creates it with ease. The pace of the movie drives along and engulfs the
viewer. In the end, all I can say is that Alien is perhaps the most
enjoyable movie I have seen.
