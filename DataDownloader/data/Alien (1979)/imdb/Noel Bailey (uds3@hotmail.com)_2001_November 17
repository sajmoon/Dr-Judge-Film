To judge ALIEN against its sequels is to blame Eve for handing Adam that
damned Granny Smith! Without Ridley Scott's masterpiece, there would BE no
sequels!<br /><br />ALIEN is almost 23 years old and stands even now as the benchmark for films
of this ilk. Even the fabulously entertaining ALIENS did not (and nor did
it
TRY) replicate its claustrophobic fear, its style, its inventiveness.
Ridley
Scott is a one-of-a-kind director. Like Stanley Kubrick (and I do not seek
to equate them here) he has an individuality that comes through in his
movies and stamps them as being HIS alone. ALIEN, LEGEND, BLADE RUNNER and
of course GLADIATOR all bear the mark.
The sensitivity, the human angle, the unique (at some point) blue lit
filtered backdrop. He is an artiste!<br /><br />ALIEN has dated very little, evidenced only by the youth of the actors. Can
anyone see a similarity (more-so in attitude) between the young Sigourney
Weaver and Jane Fonda in her youth?<br /><br />The bridge of the Nostromo, made up primarily from electronic junk lying
around the place was innovative (agreed, &quot;Mother&quot; looks rather old hat,
especially with her clunky old DOS interface!) The storyline has been
re-hashed so many times since, but in 1979 it was fresh and cutting-edge
stuff. The interior of the alien craft with the 'space jockey' was a
jaw-dropping visual and the barely-glimpsed alien, fear incarnate! Not too
many bio-mechanical twin jaw chompers before IT!
The ONLY time the alien looked even vaguely suss was when Ripley blasted it
out of the airlock. Just for a second one had an impression of the old
&quot;man-in-a-suit&quot; routine!<br /><br />Characterizations were superb, as they were in ALIENS! The demise of
Lambert
particularly, brings the horror of the alien confrontingly close to the
viewer. Electronic sound fx and the musical score serve to heigten suspense
at key moments, of which there are several. In the upshot however, the film
belongs to Weaver as Ripley (although a young Ian Holm is brilliant as
Ash -
watch his facial expressions!) a model of constructive thinking,
resourcefulness and bravery.<br /><br />No, they don't come much better than this!
