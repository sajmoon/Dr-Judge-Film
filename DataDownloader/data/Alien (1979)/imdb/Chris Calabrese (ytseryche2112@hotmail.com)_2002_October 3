When I think of all the movies I've ever seen throughout my entire life,
Alien sticks in my mind as being the scariest.  I distinctly remember
turning my head away or covering my eyes at certain points in the movie.
I
think I had to see it around 20 times before I could watch it without
getting really scared.  I used to look under my bed for years because of
this movie.  The concept behind the aliens is so original.  Words cannot
describe the emotions I would feel while watching this movie during my
youth.
