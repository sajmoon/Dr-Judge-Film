In space, no one can hear you scream...<br /><br />This tagline showed up on the poster for one of the most enticing,
suspenseful, emotive scifi/horror movies. ALIEN is truly the best of the old
horror.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver portrays a young flight officer Ellen Ripley, who, along
with her crew, retrieve a distress transmission from a desolate planet and
go to investigate. Soon it is clear this is no distress call.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that everyone see this movie. If you've seen the
others, see this one now. It has the best suspense I've ever seen in a film.
The first time you watch it (In the dark, alone) you may find yourself
holding your breath a lot. The depth of the story is amazing, and the
special effect work is spectacular. The actors were all superb, and Ridley
Scott is one of the best directors in this galaxy.  <br /><br />See it, enjoy it.
