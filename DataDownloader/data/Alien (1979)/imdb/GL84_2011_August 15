A ship&#x27;s investigation of a distress signal given off on a distant
planet introduces them to a savage creature that begins to hunt them
down one-by-one inside the ship.<br /><br />While this may be regarded as a legendary film, this one instead comes
across as overrated. While it may have a countless number of influences
from the different aspects surrounding it (the set-design, ship, the
alien, etc) the fact remains that, if taken on as a singular film
devoid of any of its influences, this one isn&#x27;t all that great. Plus,
for all the imitations, none of it is really important to the film
itself and speaks far more to the reaction of the public rather than
anything else to do with the film itself. It&#x27;s so slowly paced and
lifeless at times that it&#x27;s a struggle to stay invested in what&#x27;s going
on, hardly inventive at all since these are where it&#x27;s money-makers are
spent, the building-up of the suspense in what&#x27;s going to happen next.
Giving a reason to remain in a state of suspense is just as important
as the release, and this one forgets to do that constantly. You also
have the fact that this one barely contains anything about the alien,
either featuring scenes of it or getting to know it, that there&#x27;s just
such a dearth of knowledge about what it&#x27;s doing that there&#x27;s very
little beyond the physical, which is pretty impressive admittedly, to
really get worked up with this one over. As mentioned, the psychical
appearance of the creature is really the film&#x27;s best idea, suitably
foreign and extraterrestrial in concept and execution and looking quite
imposing when first viewed with some really nice features about it that
make it something to be feared. It also has a few rather fun shock
scenes that are quite impressive, which are well-known and won&#x27;t be
repeated and the stalking scenes in the later half are really
suspenseful, so there is some good stuff here, but overall this is
still somewhat overrated.<br /><br />Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and animals in danger.
