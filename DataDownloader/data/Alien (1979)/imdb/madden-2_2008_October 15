I genuinely love this film, but I have always thought that this was the
strangest crew structure in the history of sailing vessels.<br /><br />I count four officers: Dallas, Kane, Ripley, and Ash. Parker and Brett
are clearly &quot;crew&quot;. Lambert is a bit of a mystery. She is a pilot (i.e.
more skilled than just a helmsman/helmsperson). In the military, that
would make her an officer. On a civilian vessel, who knows? Since she
shows no leadership ability whatsoever, I&#39;ll count her as crew. That&#39;s
a 4:3 officers-to-crew ratio. Even if one discounts Ash as having no
real supervisory authority, it&#39;s at least ten times too high.<br /><br />Wow! How does the &quot;Company&quot; make money? Moreover, there is a lot of
living/working space allocated to just seven people. How can one
justify a sick bay/science bay that size on the SHUTTLE? And if the
shuttle has a sick bay that large, why would it not have facilities to
support seven people in an emergency? As they say in Jesus Christ
Superstar, &quot;Only wanna know...&quot;
