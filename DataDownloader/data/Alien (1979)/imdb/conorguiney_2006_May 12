Alien is without a doubt my favorite Sci-fi movie of all time. This is
the movie that launched Sigorney Weaver and director Ridley Scott to
stardom. Sigorney Weaver is in top form as the hard yet fragile Ellen
Ripley which she does a tremendous job of playing. Ridley Scott hit a
high with this one, i like a lot of his films especially ones like
Gladiator and Blade Runner but this is my all time favorite.<br /><br />At the time it came out it was given mixed reviews and with the treat
of being over shadowed by Lucas&#39;s Star Wars where a lot of CGI and
digital effects came into play, Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien over comes all.<br /><br />Ridley Scott brilliantly created an spinetingling atmosphere where the
viewer feels uneasy yet entertained, Scott is one of those directors
who is great at creating worlds for cine-maniacs to get lost in.<br /><br />This is the movie that set the stage for a lot of Sci-fi horror movies
(i.e. Event Horizon, The Abyss) but even today with the amazing new
special effects Alien stills stands on top.
