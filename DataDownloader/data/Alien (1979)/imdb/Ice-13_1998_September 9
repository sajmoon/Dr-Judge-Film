1998_September 9 

Alien is a very intense and interesting flick, which can really capture
the imagination of a person, based on the viewers ability to focus and
believe that what they're seeing is real.
This was one of the sci-fi shockers I watched in the past that is just,
unforgettable.  Based on H. R. Geiger's idea and realization of the alien
creature, director Ridley Scott and author Dan O'Bannon create an
adrenaline rockin' thriller, which 
I believe cannot and has not been surpassed.  The introduction of Sigourney
Weaver as character W.O. Ripley, was one of the best things that could have
happened to Weaver, and helped make her the star that she is today.  SFX in
the movie won it an  Oscar in 1980, and assists in leaving the viewer a
little anxious after the end, but with a clear idea of the memorable title,
especially if viewed and read about in it's original ENTIRETY, and not the
directors cut.  *Same things can be said about it's 3 ensuing sequels.
Still a sweet movie in my opinion.
