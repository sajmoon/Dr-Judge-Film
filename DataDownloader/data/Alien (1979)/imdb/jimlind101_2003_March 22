I think Ridley Scott did a fantastic job in creating a movie that still
plays on my mind to this day; Frightening, disturbing in its own way and
that great feeling of immence satisfaction when the Alien is finally
burned
up in the ships' engines are still there with me.
Sure, it's a little bit Hollywood (good [apparently] triumphs over evil)
but
that's the beauty of it all.
I think this is one of the finest casts assembled and each adds something
very special to this great film.
