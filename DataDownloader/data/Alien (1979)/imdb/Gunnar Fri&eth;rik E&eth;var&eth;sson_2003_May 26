Alien changed the sci-fi genre forever and thanks to Ridley Scott and his
people they brought us one of the greatest films of all time Alien. It has a
good plot and well made out script the special and visual effects are
amazing. The editing and the camera work are also what I would say one of
the greatest and they are also one of the main key in the film&acute;s success.<br /><br />Alien does not have a strong character development and we virtually don&acute;t
know a lot about the characters on board and they are more of a supporting
role as the camera and they effects are the lead, Unlike perhaps Aliens were
the both actors and the effects shine but that hardly matters because it is
made in a certain way that you really don&acute;t care about the characters all
that much. <br /><br />Alien has changed a lot of people lives. Many would like to say that Aliens
is the best one in the series. I think Aliens is a brilliant but not as good
as this one the third one is also good and I think that one is one of the
most underrated films of the past 15 years. I didn&acute;t like the fourth one at
all by the way. Overall a fantastic film 9/10.<br /><br />
