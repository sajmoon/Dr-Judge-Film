The late, great Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote about &quot;Alien&quot;
(actually, she was reviewing &quot;Aliens&quot; but I digress).  She wrote &quot;Alien
turned your insides into knots.  It made you dread the scenes to come.&quot; 
Exactly.  When I saw this movie at the age of 14, I nearly couldn't breathe.
 I both wanted it to end and keep on going all at the same time.  Everything
about it works: the cast, the effects and mostly, Ridley Scott's amazing
direction.  By now his &quot;look&quot; has been copied so many times (and by his
brother, Tony, as well) that to new viewers, the movie might seem old hat. 
But back in '79, this was a new, dark vision that was terrifying.  The Alien
is truly a shocking, gruesome monster.  He/She's(?) your worst nightmare: a
creature with no remorse, no soul.  Just a killing machine with no other
agenda.  And you're trapped.  If you look at the film, there's actually very
little gore (yes, except for the famous stomach bursting scene).  There is
one complaint I have about &quot;Aliens&quot;.  Once you have seen it, experienced it,
it's done.  You will never feel the same sense of terror and doom that you
feel the first time you see it.  You can marvel at how skillfully it's made
and such but you'll never get that awful, nauseating feeling that it gave 
you upon the initial viewing.  I wish there was a way that I could have my
brain wiped out of this movie (and a few others like &quot;The Godfather&quot;) so I
could experience them fresh all over again.  There's nothing like it.  That
is what makes great film.  In this regard, &quot;Aliens&quot; is somewhat better.  You
can enjoy the action in the film over and over again and pretty much feel
the same way and catch even more that you might've missed the first time. 
BOTH films are excellent compliments to the other.  They're a complete set. 
Forget the other Alien movies.  They are not in the same league as the first
two.
