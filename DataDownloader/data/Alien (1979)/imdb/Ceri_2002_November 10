23 years on (at the time or writing), this film still looks and feels
magnificent. The &quot;total environment&quot; approach to the design of sets and
artifacts gives the film a level of realism rarely bettered. Nothing
looks
cheap in this film, the performances are great, the dialogue
believable.....everything feels real. Compare this to certain big-budget
movies of the last ten years and be astonished at how much better &quot;Alien&quot;
looks when you might have expected it to look creaky by
comparison.
