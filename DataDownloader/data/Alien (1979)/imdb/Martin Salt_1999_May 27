1999_May 27 

This has to be one of my favorite films. This film is the base for H.R.
Giger's nasty aliens which destroy the life of one unfortunate woman. The
most memorable moment has to be when the alien explodes from Kane's (John
Hurt) chest. From then on, Flight Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) will
suffer forever.
Sigourney Weaver is excellent as Ripley, and there should also be a
mention for a wonderfully human performance by Tom Skerritt (Captain
Dallas). Although the film definitely does not to seem to follow logic,
 We
never discover where the aliens come from, as in a home planet) this film
trips along
at quite a nice pace. A must for sci-fi fans, this film will get you
hooked
on the Alien series!
