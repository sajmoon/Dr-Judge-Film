&#39;Alien&#39; is a groundbreaking Sci-fi horror film expertly directed by
Ridley Scott. I prefer it slightly to it&#39;s sequel, the action packed
&#39;Aliens&#39;. The film is slow to start as it depicts the vastness of
space. The creature design is amazing and the Special Effects remain
terrifyingly effective. Sigourney Weaver plays the reluctant heroine
although everyone does a good job. The last forty five minutes are pure
horror and genuinely scary. Tension is expertly ratcheted up as (MINOR
SPOILERS) the crew starts getting killed one by one. Highly recommended
and hugely influential.<br /><br />Overall 9/10
