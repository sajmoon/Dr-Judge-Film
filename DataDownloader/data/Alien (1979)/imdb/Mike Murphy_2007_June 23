The 1970s are very well known for movies that scared audiences out of
their mind. Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; startled audiences
with a sophisticated kind of imprisonment whose purpose was to cure
when really it could have been used in the next &quot;Hostel.&quot; &quot;The Poseidon
Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; frightened audiences with the
realization that there is barely escape when in a burning building or a
sinking cruise liner. Finally &quot;The Exorcist&quot; did the worst, in short,
it made every viewer sleep with their light on for the rest of their
life. The decade closed off with another sci-fi horror classic,
&quot;Alien.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is the story of a spaceship crew who is awakened from
chronological sleep to investigate a distress signal from a distant
planet. After a bad landing, the crew of seven sends a crew of three
out onto the surface to investigate. When one crew member, Kane (John
Hurt) is lowered into a derelict ship, he is attacked by an alien being
that clings to his face. Meanwhile, crew member Ellen Ripley (Sigourney
Weaver) translates the supposed distress signal into a warning,
however, they do not understand why it would be a warning until it&#39;s
too late. An Alien being is now loose on the ship.<br /><br />The crew is now faced with a challenge, a loose killer Alien on the
ship. They must keep together to stay and alive and make themselves
kill or be killed.<br /><br />Known as a sci-fi horror classic, &quot;Alien&quot; isn&#39;t all that it&#39;s worked up
to be. Being in every book of movies that are &quot;must-sees&quot; and #51 on
the Top 250 would peak anyone&#39;s interest, but i can assure you, it&#39;s
nothing special, just another sci-fi movie.<br /><br />If you want to see a good, classic Sci-fi movie, you&#39;d have a better
chance watching the original Star Wars trilogy again or even &quot;Starship
Troopers.&quot; &quot;Alien&quot; is nothing more than an entertaining movie. With
decent acting, mediocre plot, good directing, and a forgettable twist.
I can say that I can only give it an 8 marking it solely on directing
and entertainment. If I rated it solely on plot and conflict, it would
be 5/10. I&#39;m sorry for anyone that did really enjoy this movie.
