It's more than well done combination of great acting,directing and
a
script. The movie is supposed to be considered just a thriller,while it
covers much wider spectrum of genres. The basis is a science fiction
story,
yet here the plot is much more phylosofic and scince fiction is only a
frame
coming to emphasize the main ideas which are universal, such as : Human
existanse and its price,the essence  of difference between human and
organic,which is not only the intellect (see the sciene of Ash's &quot;death&quot;).<br /><br />Every time Ridley Scott deals with such ideas (see Blade Runner)
the
output is overwhelming.
The presence of Sigourney Wiever is electrifying.The first
pheminist
intergalactic heroine couldn't find a better actress, and let's not forget
the design of every little thing we see there,hey fellows it was only
1979,which means no computer graphics!!!! I'm not sure i would have
managed
to see the movie without closing my eyes, had it been done than with all
the
computer technics of the day<br /><br />
