Amazing scenes, great special effects and lots of thrills make this a
classic sci-fi thriller. Acting all around is great. Plot twists that
suprise. And let's not forget about the Alien. Great design and although you
can tell that it is just a guy inside of a suit, it is really an astounding
looking creature that makes you glad they don't really
exist.
