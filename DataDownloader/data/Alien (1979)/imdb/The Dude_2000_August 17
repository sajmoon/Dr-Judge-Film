Alien<br /><br />Rating: ***** (5 out of 5)<br /><br />The plot of Alien should be vaguely familiar to most people. An alien egg is
planted in the chest of one the crew members of the commercial ship
Nostromo. Later, a baby alien bursts out of said crew member's chest and
quickly matures into an Alien. The creature hunts down the crew members, the
crew members fight back, and one by one they die.<br /><br />Alien could have been a boring, haunted house flick in space. Yet thanks to
the visionary mind of Ridley Scott, the film was able to rise above the
haunted house cliches and create a film that is both nightmarish and
imaginative. H.R. Giger deserves special credit for designing the Alien
itself, which is arguably one of the scariest monsters put on
screen.<br /><br />The cast is perfect, especially the then new screen actress, Sigourney
Weaver, but no one ever saw this film for the acting. What really makes this
film great is its near perfect building of tension (especially between
Ripley and Ash), the truly horrifying creature, and the claustrophobic feel
of the whole movie.
