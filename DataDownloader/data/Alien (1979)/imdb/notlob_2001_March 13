One of my favourite movies.<br /><br />What enthrals me every time I see it, is the intelligence behind the whole
thing, the way the people and spaceships look and operate is believable
(eg
a tug towing a huge mineral refinery through space - obviously if the
journey takes months, it makes sense to not just transport the minerals,
but
refine them while you do it - little points like that make this a jewel of
a
film).<br /><br />Of course the main thing is the Alien, which is again handled most
intelligently, instead of the normal Hollywood approach of spending all
the
budget on special monster effects to the detriment of the story and thus
having to justify that expense by showing you the monster in as many
different, ultimately boring ways as possible, its left mostly to our
imaginations (far more powerful than any effect) with only a few glimpses
to
keep the tension going.  The incubation idea borrowed from the desert wasp
and the lifecycle of the Alien is intriguing, its not just another monster
&quot;created&quot; by radiation or some superficial reason, somebody put some
thought
into it, I appreciate that.<br /><br />The temptation for large explosions and massive weaponry is resisted most
admirably. Instead the story, acting, attention to detail and management
of
tension and mood by Ripely Scott still make me cower behind a pillow after
seeing this movie many times.<br /><br />
