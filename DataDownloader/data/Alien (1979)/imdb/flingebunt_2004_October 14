There is something about the Alien series of movies which is very
different from nearly every other series. Of the 4 movies made,
different like different movies. Yes, most people like Aliens, which
set the standard for soldier SF.<br /><br />For myself, Alien is the better movie. Full of tension and interesting
and real characters. The space ship nostramo is directed to investigate
a signal from a planet. It turns out to be from an alien space ship.
The bring an alien creature which is attached to the face of one the
crew back onboard.<br /><br />The creature is the ultimate biological weapon. It kills the crew one
by one (most because the go into the darkest parts of the ship and say
&quot;let's split up&quot;...they deserve to die).<br /><br />This movie brings a strong female lead in the character Ripley, who is
as tough as nails (but still finds time to cry a little as well as
going back to say the ship's cat).<br /><br />Yes, in some ways the movie is a little slow. In fact, read the script,
the opening is much more exciting on paper than in the way it was
filmed (restrictions from 1979 era special effects). <br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't seen the any of the Alien movies, watch the all.
If you don't like one, there many be another you love. I hated Alien
cubed (alien 3), but loved Alien, Aliens and found Alien resurrection
interesting.
