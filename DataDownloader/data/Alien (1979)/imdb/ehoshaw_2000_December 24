I rented &quot;Alien&quot; recently. It is now one of my favorite science
fiction/horror films. Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright,
Ian Holm, and three others are on the ship Nostromo, heading back to Earth.
They crash land on a bizarre planet harboring large eggs which contain a
slimy parasite resembling an oversized hermit crab. One of the parasites
attaches itself to a crew member and he is brought back on the ship...terror
ensues as the creature does some funny things (i won't ruin them for
you)...and quickly grows into a slimy monster with like 10 mouths full of
razor-sharp teeth. There is blood, gore, excellent suspense, good acting,
good direction, and nice music. I really love this film and plan to see the
sequels. Enjoyable, shocking, fast-paced...see it!!!
