One of the most original, suspenseful &#x26; powerful science-fiction films
of all time, Alien is Ridley Scott&#x27;s breakthrough film &#x26; a perfect
blend of horror &#x26; science-fiction &#x26; today is regarded as a timeless
classic in both genres. A triumph of art direction, set design, special
effects &#x26; narration, Alien continues to be one of the most influential
films in both science- fiction &#x26; modern horror.<br /><br />Set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, Alien is unsettling from its
very first frames. The plot follows a 7 members crew en-route to Earth
on board the huge commercial ship &#x27;Nostromo&#x27;. When interrupted by a
distress signal from a desolate planet, the crew lands to investigate &#x26;
discover a deadly life form that breeds within a human host. And so
begins the horror. The horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial
creature which itself is a brilliant original fusion of insect, man &#x26;
machine.<br /><br />The cast worked great as a team &#x26; it was good to see every character
getting equal importance &#x26; were made more believable by their
performances. The direction as well as writing is simply brilliant. Dan
O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s vision of the monster itself &#x26; the futuristic world he set
the plot in deserves a bow. Ridley Scott&#x27;s atmospheric visuals &#x26;
emphasis on realism over movie heroics provided Alien an ageless
appeal. The art direction, set designs &#x26; visual effects also
contributed a lot to make the film more realistic &#x26; believable by
giving attention to every minute detail of the ship as well as the
universe.<br /><br />Bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create
suspense &#x26; the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the
presence of the monster either, Ridley Scott succeeds in creating an
atmosphere that constantly provides a feel of uneasiness throughout its
runtime. Gaining much of its impact from its unique environment, beauty
of the space as well as the space vessel&#x27;s interior &#x26; terror of the
alien with unpredictable shock moments, Alien is one of the best
crafted horror films ever.<br /><br />But the biggest strength of Alien is its emphasis on suspense over gore
&#x26; graphic kills which separates it from slasher films &#x26; of course, its
pacing. Alien actually takes its time &#x26; waits until the viewers are
immersed into its world &#x26; is at its scariest when nothing is happening,
as Ridley Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run
wild. The suspense is taken to a further level by the accompanying
silence &#x26; Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s tense score turning almost every frame into
a potential nightmare scenario. The sudden shocks are huge here. The
most important thing in a horror film is not what you see, but the
effect of what you think you saw &#x26; that&#x27;s where Alien triumphs.<br /><br />Science-fiction horror doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. A genuine
fright classic. An unforgettable experience.
