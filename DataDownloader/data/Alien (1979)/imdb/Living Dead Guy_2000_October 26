I was reading reviews on this movie, and I was shocked to find out that
some
people found it boring.  I agree that it moves a little slow at first, but
it never drags anything out longer than it has to, and once the alien
comes
into the picture it seems to end pretty quickly, with death scenes so
close
together they're almost on top of each other.  I thought all of the acting
was top-notch (especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Veronica
Cartwright
as Lambert), and the movie itself is so perfect that I can honestly think
of
nothing bad to say about it.  And anybody who thought this movie sucked
probably enjoyed I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.<br /><br />My rating for Alien (1979):  10 out of 10
