Alien is a famous movie. Almost everyone has heard of it. Most of those
who have seen it do not like it. It is a slow movie amplified by the
lack of music. It is a good movie full of suspense and, yes, gore. It
is a gory movie (though not compared to todays movies).<br /><br />A good movie, just for a different generation. Many from the generation
we all know think Aliens is better; the sequel. That&#39;s because this one
is the horror, that one&#39;s the action movie. It&#39;s still a good movie,
but I like this one better.<br /><br />The first and second movies are the only movies that are classics,
though three is good...ish. More like fun. I haven&#39;t seen the fourth
yet, but i&#39;ve seen vs. Predator, and it sucks. Stick with this one.
