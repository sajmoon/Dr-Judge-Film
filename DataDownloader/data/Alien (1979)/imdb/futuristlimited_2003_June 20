Ridley Scott's masterpiece of the genre.  If you were one of the fortunate
to acquire The Alien Legacy Box set with &quot;The Alien Legacy&quot; bonus tape
(dvd), this movie suddenly becomes more than than just a beautiful and
intricate work of art.  H.R. Giger discusses his nightmares and dreams and
you can't help but be enraptured in his &quot;madness&quot;.  Everyone who helped
make
this film all talk about the incredibility of it and show what it was like
to make this &quot;genre&quot; film at the time (1979).  In 1981, as a boy, I read
the
book and it enthralled me.  Though I give credit to &quot;The Black Hole&quot; and
&quot;Tron&quot; as films that inspired my passion for sci-fi, the book &quot;Alien&quot;
truly
birthed my fascination with creatures from outer space.  Now to talk about
the film...<br /><br />Atmospheric, from the moan of the beginning score, to the sheer creepiness
of the opening sequence, this film gets to the nerves immediately.  After
having read the book, I had expectations, and they were met to my
satisfaction on a grand level.  The intricacies of the ship design to the
planet's environment and the creatures totally impressed me and left
lasting
images in my mind.  To date there is no other alien creature (other than
maybe John Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot;-albeit more a scary film)that I find
more
fascinating and just down right cool.  This film deserves the high rating
it
has here at IMDb.
Cheers all you sci-fi buffs!<br /><br />My Nods:  The infamous &quot;chest-bursting&quot; scene!
