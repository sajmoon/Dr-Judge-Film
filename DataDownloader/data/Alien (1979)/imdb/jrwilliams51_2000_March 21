I think the ending says it all for the Most, bringing into focus like a
fairy tale that comes true the Princes of the Nile floating out there in
space for generations to come, and for all that are near in the
trigonometry
of space. I've read also about the movie the Alien, and it's like as if
never enough could be said with all it's documentary, and with all that
can
be introduced to it ever throwing generation of commentary. I think it's a
great movie and of course a prelude to all the other alot like eating good
ice-cream. A real dream boat of flavor. I mean, who ever would have
thought
of a knock-out bod, and bode of a body that could take out a grurome,
all-teeth-showing alien.
