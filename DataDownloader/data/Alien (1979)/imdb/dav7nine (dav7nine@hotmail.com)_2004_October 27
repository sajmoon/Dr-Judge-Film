An absolute classic!<br /><br />I have seen Alien many times, but I just watched AVP at the pictures
and it forces you to go back and review one more time the whole Alien
World. If you like Alien then you must buy &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;, this is
the most comprehensive collection of Alien features.<br /><br />I was born in 1979 so I can't quite fully comprehend what it must have
been like for people to see it at the pictures, when nobody really knew
much about it. People had just watched Star Wars and would be filled
with the romantic notions of space and furry chewbaccas that it
portrays.... this is very, very different!<br /><br />It's just an absolute classic.... I've read the scrrenplay (in
paperback format) and that's just mind-blowing as well, it adds a whole
different angle to the film.<br /><br />The acting, art, sets and atmosphere are all great... I'm surprised
it's only 63 or whatever it is in the IMDb top 100, it's quite possibly
flawless.<br /><br />You must watch this... 9/10
