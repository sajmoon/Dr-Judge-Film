***********************************************************<br /><br />WARNING: contains some spoilers, sadly.<br /><br />***********************************************************<br /><br />OK, i&#39;ve seen all of the alien and predator movies, including alien
versus predator, (i own them all), and i&#39;ll tell u, this was probably
the scariest of &#39;em all, ill have 2 say. especially when tom skirt or
whoever that guy was, when he was in the air shafts and he turned
around and the alien jumped out right at him! <br /><br />Alien was the scariest of the series, but not the best. even Alien3 was
a bit better, id have to say, sadly. um... but i guess since Alien was
made in 1979, it was pretty good...back then, i guess. it may have been
better than AvP, because there wasn&#39;t that many scary parts to alien
versus predator. but id give alien a good high rating, considering the
circumstances it was made in.<br /><br />id give the gore factor a low rating, because it&#39;s not all about that
in this movie. it&#39;s more scary than gory. id have to also give the
swearing a low mark, cause it wasn&#39;t as much as the rest of the series,
(especially Alien3). but if u look closely on the wall at Ripley&#39;s feet
when she is thrown on the bed thing, there are pictures of all these
women...i shan&#39;t go on...? that was kinda uncalled for. the entire
movie was pretty well done, i think.<br /><br />If i could change some parts, i think i would, though. I&#39;m not that
sure of this, but i didn&#39;t get it when Ripley got the paper thing
shoved in her mouth, and she couldn&#39;t breathe.... like, why doesn&#39;t she
breathe through her nose???? {:=l well, i guess its not that
believable. <br /><br />well, i don&#39;t want to spoil the movie for u if u haven&#39;t seen it yet,
because i strongly recommend this. then aliens, then alien3, then alien
resurrection, then predator, then predator2, then alien versus
predator. those are some of my favorite movies. but I&#39;m not going to
review on those, sadly.<br /><br />so overall, id give Alien a high mark, like 859/1000 and i would
recommend it to anyone who is in sci-fiction/horror movies.
