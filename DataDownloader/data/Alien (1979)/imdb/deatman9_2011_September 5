This movie is definitely one of the best horror movies of all time. It
is one of the few classics that i say should NEVER remade. The acting
is good, it is quite an older film but the special effects are solid.
The movie uses a creepy atmosphere and solid scares unlike movies
today.<br /><br />This movie is about a mining ship who lands on a distant planet
responding to an SOS (of course this is many years in the future). Once
on the planet they explore and find a crashes spacecraft. The orgin is
unknown but they go aboard and discover hundreds of eggs. They soon
find out these eggs have strange creatures in them.<br /><br />This movie is great exspecially for the fact it was filmed in 1979. If
you are a true horror fan and you haven&#x27;t seen this movie you cant
really even call yourself a true horror fan. Go watch this movie guys.
