Why horror movies like this are no longer made? The last time I really got
fear at the cinema or at home was with movies like Alien, The Shining,
Rosemary's Baby, etc. I wonder if now it only counts terror movies whose
main characters are teenagers, their soundtracks are extremely
overwhelming
and carelessly mix horror with humor. Enough!, I hope pure terror movies
are
made again, with a lot of fear and intrigue. I don't know if The Sixth
Sense
will fulfill my expectations next Saturday.
