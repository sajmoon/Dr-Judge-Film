Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece 'Alien' is one of the finest movies ever
made.  It begins with a fairly lethargic pace and mood, but there is an
initial darkness right from the beginning, even though nothing much is
happening.<br /><br />It also has a very raw atmosphere, as everything looks realistic compared to
the hocus-pocus of other science fiction such as 'Star Wars'.  There are
some very solid performences, especially from star-in-the-making Sigourney
Weaver, the ever brilliant Ian Holm and one of the most admirable actors of
the era, Harry Dean Stanton.<br /><br />One of the most credible things about the film is the lighting and sound. 
Both have been engineered to add to the atmosphere and it is both of them
that give it its fearsomeness.  The sound is particularly frightening at
times, and the moody lighting always captures the best image to make us sit
on the edge of our seats.  Throughout the film, we can sense something that
is scary, which is down to the brilliant way that Scott and the rest of the
crew have executed everything.<br /><br />Easily the most sinister movie ever.
