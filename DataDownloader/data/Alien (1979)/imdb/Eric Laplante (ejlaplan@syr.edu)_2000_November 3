2000_November 3 

Alien, along with 2001 and Star Wars, are the three best science fiction
films based in space. All other films of this type contain elements from at
least one of these films, usually more than one. Alien's biggest
contribution is it's atmosphere. The sets and camera choices give a
specific
and intense feeling watching it. This is a combination of Ridley Scott's
and
H.R. Giger's influence. The best shot in the film is the close up of Ripley
all sweaty and dirty emerging from the ladder. Beads of sweat lace her
fingers and then the focus goes to her face, scared as can be.
Great.
