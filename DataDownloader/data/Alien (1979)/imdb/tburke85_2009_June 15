Alien is a solid sci-fi film with some flaws but the good outweighs the
bad in this one. Director Ridley Scott shows his talent as a filmmaker
in Alien just like he has for all his movies some of which weren&#x27;t as
good as others. Sigourney Weaver is the stand out in the cast of course
as Ripley the tough heroine who finds herself in one dangerous
situation after another when a nightmarish alien beast begins to pick
off her crew members on board a mining ship in deep space. Tom Skerritt
is good as Dallas but he lacks screen time because his role is cut
rather short. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including
Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and
Yaphet Kotto but most of them like Skerriit aren&#x27;t really in that much.
The special effects are amazing especially for that time and the alien
looks terrifying like something out of your worst nightmares. The movie
did a claustrophobic feel because of the confined space the characters
were in because of the ship and there was a decent amount of suspense.
The movie was a little slow in the beginning but once things kicked
into high gear suspense wise it moves at a steady pace from there.
Despite some flaws Alien is still an entertaining sci-fi horror
thriller with suspense, great special effects, gruesome deaths, a scary
alien villain, and exceptional performances by the cast especially
Weaver who make it worth the time to watch.
