Alien is not a non-stop roller coaster ride. I'm not going to lie to you.
It
dooes get the heart pumping a lot, but it will not thrill a lot of today's
viewers who only like movies with too many special effects and no plot.
Yet
Alien thrilled me. It never felt too dated. The special effects are still
good by today's standards. Ridley Scott does a great job behind the
camera,
as does the entire cast in front of it. And while the cat annoyed me, the
alien itself certainly didn't. And to top all that off, this is one of
those
movies where the sets stuck out in my mind. A few flaws aside, this is a
sci-fi horror masterpiece that will not be forgotten with all the new sci
fi
crap coming out.
