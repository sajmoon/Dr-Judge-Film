this film was misdirected, unoriginal, cheaply produced and it all
showed. the plot line was absolutely atrocious and although the
producers may have added in extra splashes of gore to direct attention
from the otherwise horrible performing i do not think it can really be
considered to be a horror. i accept that it was going to have a
challenge to compete with the seemingly unrivalled success of Star Wars
(1977) however to expect to actually give George Lucas a run for his
money wit this production was ludicrous. i am not quite sure that i
have seen another film with quite the level of subordinate scripting
and meaning that does not go directly out of its way to be considered
as a joke. e.g. scream
