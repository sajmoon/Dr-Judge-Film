Great film but not as good as the follow up. One thing that i would like to
know about this movie is why does the Alien grow from the same size as
Jonesy the cat to the size of Lurch from the Adams family in about 30 mins?
Somebody let me know please.
There should be a Bill Paxton(Hudson) character in this movie to give this
film some comedy. The part when they enter the Alien spaceship is a great
film moment because the scenery is something else. H. R. Geiger has a
strange mind but without it there would not be this great
trilogy.
Alien: 6/10
Aliens: 10/10
Alien3: 4/10
Alien res:pants(my opinion)
Alien5:10/10(here's hoping)
You may not agree with my ratings but there will never be a better film
than
the 2nd one.
