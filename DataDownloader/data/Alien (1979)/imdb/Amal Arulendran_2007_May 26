Not the regular stuff pushed out by movie studios but a classic that
will have you glued to your seat till the final moments have come to
pass. A very stylish and unique shocker with the appropriate amount of
claustrophobic and fear inducing moments that are cleverly injected at
the most unexpected moments. Edge-of-your-seat moments galore as the
crew of the Nostromo is pitted against something that none of them have
come across before and the tension slowly but steadily builds and
builds with certain parts stretched and twisted to breaking point
leaving a delightful after taste in your mouth as the final moments
come reeling down. A movie that toys with the inner depths of the mind
cleverly juggling with Claustrophobia, Fear and Tension passing them
around like a magician with his wand coming up with trick after trick.
The creepy background score sending shivers down your spine creating an
ambiance that will leave you with no breath to spare with its ever
changing tone.<br /><br />The entire cast gives superb performances through out but its Sigourney
Weaver who takes the cake with a fluent performance as Ellen Ripley
who, in the latter stages gives a performance that will keep you on
your toes till the end. You will feel for each and every character
mostly because of their brilliant on-screen chemistry and the tense
atmosphere created by them.<br /><br />A movie which will have you gasping for breath and feeling some what
relieved when the final credits start rolling as you will have lived
and breathed every second of it. This is Movie-Making at its best.
