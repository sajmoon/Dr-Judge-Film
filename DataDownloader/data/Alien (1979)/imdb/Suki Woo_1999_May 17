1999_May 17 

The concept of blending true horror film elements ( what's that behind
you?
) with science fiction ( robots are spooky!) was realised to perfection in
this magical mix of the two genres. When I saw this film on it's release,
in
the dark of the cinema - it scared me to death. The effects were awesome,
the music perfect and the restraint ( remember we seldom if ever see the
creature) masterful. The art and direction trend setting. Even today I
still
jump out of my seat and bite my knuckles at all the same old places. New
age
sci-fi buffs may criticise the concepts - fans of fast paced action with
lots of loud music and lasers may feel it's slow. But this is still the
ultimate house of horror in space - you are all alone in the dark, all
hope
is gone ---and it's coming. Arrghhhhh! The original and best.
