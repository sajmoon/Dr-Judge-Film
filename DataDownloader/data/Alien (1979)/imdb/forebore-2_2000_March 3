With its many grisly special effects and truly suspenseful moments, Alien
is sci-fi/horror at its best. The film is about the crew of a space
freighter that, while returning to Earth, receives orders to land on an
unexplored planet and investigate a derelict spaceship. While
investigating
the ship, one of the crew members is infected with a deadly creature that
proceeds to burst out of his body and kill off the other crew members one
by
one. This film is very original and imaginative. It also borrows much from
classic 50s science fiction, especially The Thing. It's a very
entertaining
movie with a good story, even better directing, and one of the most
horribly
realistic special effects in film history. My favorite scene is when Tom
Skerritt shines his flashlight into a darkened corridor only to find the
creature inches away from his face. That is the only scene in my history
of
movie-watching that was both scary and unpredictable enough to make me
leap
out of my seat and scream. Alien is a truly engaging (and terrifying)
edge-of-your-seat thriller that never once lets you stop to take a breath.
