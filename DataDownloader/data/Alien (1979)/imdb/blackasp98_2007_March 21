For me,Ridley Scott has to be one of the most prolific directors of our
time.Directing Alien to be the scariest film of 1979 brought the crowd
something new.One that doesn&#39;t use antennas or blobs that ooze to move
the people.But brings forth the raw power of terrible suffering at the
hands or teeth of an alien creature that uses no remorse or mercy in
the way it kills.The cast was fantastic in their portrayal of ore
mining personnel turned re-con team to bring back an alien for their
company to use as they see fit.But when the audience sees what and why
the creature kills the way it does,it tells us that not all aliens kill
alike.No ray guns,no blasters to disintegrate,but just sheer
strength,and absolutely no feeling by the way it kills.Gory is the
horror of life,in everyday things like accidents or mishaps resulting
in loss of limbs or other,but here the creature does it for survival
not realizing that its actions are by far from normal.But the result is
total anarchy.Ridley Scott uses power combined with terror to give the
audience a feeling of what if?,making them think i wonder what that
feels like?especially by the alien using its teeth to rip apart a skull
or chest.To us this is real classic horror at its best,and ridley scott
knows how to deliver and give us the willies.Fantastic work.
