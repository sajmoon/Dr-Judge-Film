I&#39;m of the school that does not see Alien as a science fiction movie.
Sure, it takes place in outer space and the killer is an alien... but
it think it&#39;s a slasher flick, and a damn good one at that.<br /><br />Ridley Scott took a stark science fiction atmosphere and was able to
put, essentially, Leatherface (not Freddy or Jason - they hadn&#39;t been
created yet) smack dab into it (and people wonder why I think most
post-1980 or so slasher flicks are old hat). It was brilliant, and he
created one of the few movies that, to this, day, can scare me.<br /><br />The acting, casting, writing, directing, cinematography... it&#39;s all
top-notch. I can&#39;t say anything bad about this movie. This movie is
clearly a work of art.<br /><br />If you&#39;ve never seen it, and you aren&#39;t deathly afraid of horror
movies, then I suggest getting a hold of a copy, grabbing your
significant other, turning the lights out and watching some good,
bloody fun.
