1999_November 1 

This film is an utter classic. It's good in the same way that 'The Catcher
in the Rye' is. You can't tell why, it just IS. 
   The story certainly wasn't especially original; the film itself was
one-track (Though some - myself included - would argue that that's part of
its individuality); but the chasing scifi pack is so far behind that it
probably will stand on it's own for generations.
   It's too bad it wasn't allowed to stand alone, since to a certain to
degree the sequels have diluted the formula of a film concentrating on one
thing; terror. No time wasted on sub-plots or character development, or
expensive sets and special effects.    The fact that the film is so good
without all the additions that most people seem to feel films must have
these days (Don't get me wrong, sometimes they help!), speaks volumes about
its maturity, its directness, and also about moviemakers/moviegoers
today.
   An outstanding example.
