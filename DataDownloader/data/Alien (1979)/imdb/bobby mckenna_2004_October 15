Alien that one word basically sums up what is to come. some people hear
the word alien and think of little green men whereas I hear it and a
terrifying chill comes over me.<br /><br />I first saw the film when I was six years old and it was one of the
first films I ever saw not to mention my first horror and sci-fi and it
wasn't until I was eleven till I fully got to appreciate the alien's
beauty. Every time I watch the film I am utterly petrified at the
creature and amazed at how big the sets are and the amount of effort
that has gone into what i can only describe as the best film ever.<br /><br />If you haven't seen alien yet then you haven't truly experienced
horror, but remember if you are going to watch it then get ready for a
terror which will be with you for a lifetime.
