1999_September 30 

Superb visual motifs slowly unwinding...a space-cast ensemble unexpectedly
facing an Alien horror...Giger's merging of the 
techno-organic, evoking disturbing images from the darkness
of
our  psyche...alien &quot;face-huggers&quot; implanting seeds
of destruction, foreshadowing pugnacious infants bursting from
frail
humanity...corporate androids plotting schemes of greed...the
monstrous Alien lurking within Nostromo's dark, steamy corridors...silently
waiting with machine-like sets of saliva-
drooling teeth...prepared to rip flesh and dismember limbs...
the heroine Ripley victorious....the Alien forcefully ejected
into the blackness of space...we have all suffered.
