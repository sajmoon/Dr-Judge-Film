This movie is the best of the series.  Most people that I've talked to
feel
that Aliens is the best.  I do agree that the second film is an
outstanding
film, and an awesome action movie, but you know what the marines are up
against, at least Ripley does, the same aliens from the first movie,
accept
the Queen which was really cool.  In the first film you don't know what
to
expect, and neither do the characters, your left wondering what will
happen
next, and when will be the next time you'll jump out of your seat.  This
movie is eerie and wild.  The second movie has great action.  How can you
not like the Space Marines!!!! :):)    Anyway this first film gets my
choice
for best movie of this series followed by Aliens as a very close second.
After that the rest of the films go downhill.  I give Alien a 10 out of
10!!!! :):)
