I'm sure you have all heard about this film and I'm sure you have all made
your decisions on whether or not to see this film. Stories of how Ridley
Scott merged the dying Sci-Fi genre with the suspense genre to magnificently
new and inventive ways, which is still astounding today. All this is true,
but this movie is highly overrated. Much like Bladerunner, Scott's a great
and innovative director that finds a really great niche that had been
ignored for a few years, dust it off make it huge for half a second and that
leads to a revival of said genre and then that genre because is popular
again the film becomes old hat. That really is the big problem with Scott.
They are great and inspire imitators that muddy the pool of his genius.<br /><br />9 out of 10
