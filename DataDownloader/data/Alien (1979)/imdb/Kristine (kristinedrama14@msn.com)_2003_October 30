I just saw the movie in the theatre. The &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. Maybe I expected
too much. But it wasn't that great. I thought that it has to be a scary
movie, it's been placed higher above the &quot;Exorcist&quot; in the top 250.<br /><br />Am I the only one who questions why there was gravity in space? I'll assume
that it takes place in the future. But when they arrive on another planet,
they walk perfectly. No, uh uh, that's never going to happen. Not unless the
suits they were wearing were super suits. And where did the robot thing come
from? Did anyone expect that to happen?<br /><br />The alien itself only appears like in 15 minutes of the movie. Sigourny does
kick ass. I admit this was a creepy movie. But not scary. Not &quot;OH MY GOD!
AHH!&quot; scary. It's like &quot;Oh, wow. OK. Ooh.&quot; <br /><br />Maybe I need to give the movie another chance. I just wish they didn't say
in the trailer &quot;The scariest movie ever made&quot;. Because I will point out more
than half of the movie that could've been better. <br /><br />As of the acting, good job to the cast. Great setting. And it was fun to
watch. But there were just too many questions:
1.) the gravity thing(i mentioned)
2.) they've mastered gravity, but there are no lights on the
ship?
3.) there is water leakage in the ship? you'd think they'd be
careful
4.) was there any point to the cat?<br /><br />I can go on and on. But by then I'll be retired.<br /><br />6/10
