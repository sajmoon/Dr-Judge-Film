This movie absolutely terrified me as a ten-year-old way back in 1979. To
this day, I still can't watch this film all the way through. There's no
denying how effective this film is, and the bits and pieces I've seen
since
1979 only reaffirm this belief. It is _the_ scariest thing I have ever
seen,
and it will possibly remain so. Complete genius, though.
