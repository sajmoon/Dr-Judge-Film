1998_September 9 

I can't believe there is anyone who hasn't seen this film at least once. 
Still, I come back to it again and again, and again and again it gets me
leaping out of my seat!  The story is downright terrifying (and, unlike a
lot of sci-fi, absolutely believable), the acting very strong, the suspense
incredible, the filming excellent - and the setting and monster straight
out of the worst nightmare anyone ever had!  Tread carefully when you walk
away from this film... you never know what may be following you!
