2003_June 23 

I saw this film originally in Seattle when it first opened. As a sci-fi
buff, paticularly in my youth in the 50's, I was impressed by it's
quality,
it's gothic aura, it's excellent acting by a top notch cast, and it's
creation of the first truly female hero I had ever seen in a movie. There
have been a lot of &quot;heroines&quot; in movies but this paved new ground. Maybe
someone could come up with an example I missed but I've given it some
thought and I draw a blank in trying to compare it to anything that came
before. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, the Science Officer, was the only
person
on board the ship that kept her head when all hell was breaking loose.She
had no romantic or family ties to any other character that caused her to
rise up and take over for her husband like Pilar say, in Hemingway's &quot;For
Whom the Bell Toll's.&quot; She was not merely equal to a man or inspitational
like the Katherine Hepburn's Rose in the African Queen. She had no special
gifts like Joan of Arc, Wonder Woman, or Sheena of the jungle. There were
no
sexy gimmicks, she never deffered to any of the male crew except by rank.
In
other words she was like  John Wayne's, Clint Eastwood's, or Sylvester
Stallone's characters in her ability to get things done and keep her head.
Sigourney, by the way, is a hell of a lot better actor then any of those
guys. This was a good movie in many ways but I've never heard it mentioned
as a ground breaking vehicle for women's equality.
