Well strangely enough,this was the last Alien film i saw.It helped that it
was on DVD.First of all the SFX are stunning for a film made in the 70's
and
i must commend Ridley Scott for that.For a Sci-Fi the plot is very
believable.As for acting i thought Yaphet Kotto and Ian Holm were
especially
good and added to the film in their own unique ways.I was a tad
disappointed
with Sigourney Weaver as this was one of her worst performances in an
Alien
film.That said,she didnt take anything away from the film.I thought this
was
the second best film in the series,behind Resurrection which was an
absolute
classic.This film should be high on your priority list for watching.
