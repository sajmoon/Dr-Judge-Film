Alien is getting old, but it hasn't lost any of its appeal. There are
some people out there who are gonna try to tell you its &quot;outdated&quot; or
that its &quot;running out of steam&quot;. Those people suck. While we can argue
about the film's merit, one thing we can all agree on is that in
general, some people simply suck. And the people who disrespect this
film definitely suck.<br /><br />Thats sorta why I like Alien. Alien doesn't discriminate between people
who suck or don't suck, Alien is simply hungry.<br /><br />Now, its true this film has a slower pace. Essentially, this is what we
in the know like to refer to as building tension and suspense. You also
don't see the Alien up close all that much. Whether that was an
artistic choice or a budgetary solution is up in the air, but it works
because Ridley Scott is a master film maker.<br /><br />The film begins by building an incredibly realistic atmosphere,
directly contrasting the cartoony feel of Star Wars and sci-fi in
general. Going with the incredibly surreal not to mention nightmarish
designs of Giger's cannon was truly inspired. Never has there been a
more terrifying yet beautiful, intriguing yet grotesque creature as the
&quot;Xenomorph&quot;. <br /><br />In the sequels to follow, we learn more about the insect-like life
stages of the xenomorph and its various stages of growth. Its all
really cool stuff that is more sophisticated than it actually needs to
be. You can read into it enough to explain the almost human-like
proportions/configuration of the xenomorph that appears in this film,
and the dog-like xenomorph that appears in film 3.<br /><br />Alien truly was an amazing film and along with Blade Runner, has
solidified Ridley Scott as one of the sci-fi gods. You can still find
references to these films today and its a trend that will likely
continue well into the future... whatever that future may bring.<br /><br />Some people on here worry that teenagers won't appreciate this film; I
disagree. I think they'll be channel surfing late at night and come
across a sci-fi marathon with movies like Planet of the Apes and 2001
and sit back and be blown away.
