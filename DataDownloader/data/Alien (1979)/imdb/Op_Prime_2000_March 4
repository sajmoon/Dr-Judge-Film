While Aliens is my favorite of the series, Alien is way scarier. Sigourney
Weaver delivers a great performance. The music and effects are terrific.
What makes this movie scarier than the others is because you never know when
the Alien is going to appear and who's next to get it. Unlike the sequels,
Alien was more about scares then action. Overall, my second favorite of the
movie series.
