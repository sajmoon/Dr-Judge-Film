Don't get me wrong. I love this movie. The sheer beauty of the designs -
the
'Nostromo', Giger's work on the Alien, the alien ship etc. all adds to the
sheer enjoyment of this movie. I saw it with my father in 1980 on the big
screen, and several times we almost fell of our seats. It is horrific!
Great
stuff.<br /><br />The Point of my summary is this.. without the SF-trappings it would
function
fine as an excellent horror movie - which is exactly what it is! In my
book,
technology in SF movies should add something intrinsic to the action that
is
just not possible today - like in 'Bladerunner' with the replicants etc.
In
'Alien' this is just not the case.<br /><br />'Alien' could be a great Brothers Grimm's Tale if you replaced the bad guy
with a dragon or some other such monster.<br /><br />The fun part of this film-series is that the movies are so diverse ... a
pure horror movie, an action thriller - and a somewhat philosophical
thriller. Alas I haven't yet seen #IV, as I got a bit disappointed with
#III.<br /><br />Anyway - a great movie by any standard. Well done indeed Mr.
Scott!!<br /><br />9/10
