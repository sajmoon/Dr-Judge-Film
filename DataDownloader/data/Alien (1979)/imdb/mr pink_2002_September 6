CUT! This is something Mr. Scott should learn to say every once in awhile.
This could have been a great film, it does have a decent story,
unfortunately the director was just to incompetent to make this a good
flick. Had there been more editing and fewer ungodly long takes it would
become a much more enjoyable watch.
