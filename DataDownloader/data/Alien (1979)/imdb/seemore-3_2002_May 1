It is interesting to note that both Ridley Scott and Robert Wise never made
their name from directing any one genre of film.  In fact, they seem to go
out of their way to make as diverse range of films as possible:<br /><br />Gladiator; Thelma and Louise; The Duellists; (Ridley Scott), The Day The
Earth Stood Still; West Side Story; Sound of Music; (Robert
Wise).<br /><br />Yet they both managed, in my view, to make the two most effective horror
films in their era: The Haunting (1963, Wise) and Alien (1979,
Scott).<br /><br />I think what the two men have in common, is their approach to filmmaking,
which is treating their audiences with great maturity. This is the
antithesis of modern filmaking now, especially in the horror
genre.<br /><br />Scott has approached Alien as he would any one of his films: to tell a good
story as effectively as possible without insulting the
audience.<br /><br />The result being a plot that is, if one is honest, not far removed from any
of the slasher flicks of the eighties such as Friday the 13th, where the
cast systematically get bumped off one by one.<br /><br />Where Alien differs greatly, though, is the sheer understatedness of the
whole thing.  From the lighting and sets to the superb ensemble acting, the
whole movie is flawless.  The alien is totally believable with a life cycle
of its own.<br /><br />Scott paints his canvas with greys and blues, then to complete his
composition, adds a splash of scarlet - (you'll know it when you see
it).<br /><br />Like Wise's The Haunting, Scott's Alien sticks to the adage 'less is more'.
Thankfully, we hardly see the alien though one could argue for a change, as
the design of the alien is so good, whether seeing just a tad MORE of the
alien would have helped the audience along a bit.<br /><br />It's a small point, for it doesn't detract from the fact that Alien is one
of the most important films of its genre in the last 40 years.  This year
Alien will be 23 years old.  A new generation of DVD viewers is now enjoying
a movie that hasn't aged a jot and can still hold its own in the 21st
century.
