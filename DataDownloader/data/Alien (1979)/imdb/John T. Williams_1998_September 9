Every house has a room that strikes fear in the heart of young children. It
is usually in the basement, next to the furnace where no light from the
rest of the house seems to reach. When parents tell their kids to get
something out of this room, they usually have to enlist the help of an
older sibling just to make it down there. This room was my bedroom when my
mother rented Alien for my twelfth birthday.
I am now 26 and it has been a few years since the last nightmare. Alien is,
without question, the scariest, most frightening movie that I have ever
seen. If you want to permanently scar your children, have them watch this
movie.
