2003_October 20 

I read the book before I saw the film. In the book the original creature
is
different. On first viewing I got so frightened that I wanted to escape,
but
I sat with eyes lowered through the most tense sequences. It was not
untill
my third viewing could I watch the movie all the way through. The
apperance
of the Alien as it lowers itself behind Brett is remarkable, because one
cannot make out what the thing is. The way Scott shot the monster
presented
it as truely 'alien'. No one had ever seen anything like it before. Now of
course we are used to it, but then it scared you. The sets, the acting and
the wonderful eerie
music all congealed to lift an otherwise routine movie into a work of art.
Subliminal, sexual and terrifing. Must be seen on the big
screen.
