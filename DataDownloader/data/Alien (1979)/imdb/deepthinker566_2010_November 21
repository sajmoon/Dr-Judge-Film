This movie really scared me when I first watched it, it was one of the
most heart beating, suspenseful films ever. Made by Ridley Scott (Blade
Runner, Gladiator, Body of Lies, American Gangster, Robin Hood) It
stars Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean,
Stanton, John Hurt, etc.<br /><br />In the near future, during its return to the earth, a commercial
spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress SOS from a distant planet. The
seven-member crew are woken up from the hypersleep and the spaceship
subsequently descends on the planet. While exploring the planet, a
three-member team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge
chamber inside it containing thousands of eggs. When a curious team
member goes too near the egg the parasite inside the egg attacks him,
rendering him unconscious. He is brought back aboard, the spaceship
takes off. After a little while the parasite dies and his host wakes up
seemingly unruffled. But other crew members are unaware of the living
nightmare which is going to descend upon them when the alien creature
planted inside its unfortunate host would emerge.<br /><br />A lot of scenes in the film will give you goosebumps, such as the
facehugger appearance, and the chestburster scene (which is spoofed in
Spaceballs BTW).<br /><br />Aliens had more action than the first, because there is more suspense
and horror in the first. Not to mention the film has awesome special
effects.<br /><br />Alien is truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made (Other great
sci-fi films: Aliens, Independence Day, Avatar, Transformers, Predator,
Star Wars, Back to the Future, etc.) Alien gets 10 stars.
