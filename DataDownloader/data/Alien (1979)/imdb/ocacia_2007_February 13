This film is close to perfection, the style the music the genre. And i
am talking about it now in 2007, so put all of this into the context of
1979--wow! The pace the way it takes the viewer to this alien place, it
feels like you are there in the situation. It doesn&#39;t try to sit on the
overused Hollywood storyline or action line. The best parts have in no
action. You don&#39;t see much blood and gore but you feel it! Alien 3 had
a similar style, never understood why people didn&#39;t like it. In Aliens
it is just not classic, it is standard guns in guns out (still it is
good) but it isn&#39;t a film it is more a very good movie. Alien is a film
by all the arts standards you would want to throw at it.
