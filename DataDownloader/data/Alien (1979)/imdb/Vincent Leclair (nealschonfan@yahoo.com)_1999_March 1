1999_March 1 

Ridley Scott shows us again that he have a visual gift. He creates a great
claustrophobic atmosphere in Alien. His second movie (The Duellist was the
first one), is just great. The special effects are good for the time. There
are some scenes so intense and powerful : when the alien got out of Kane's
body is always is a great moment in film history. Visual effects made by
H.R. Giger are impressive.<br /><br />The non cast star is good. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley (who played in the
inferior sequels Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurection) shows us that she is
able to play a lead role. Tom Skeritt is good as Dallas (you must see the
uncut version to know what happens to him...)<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith 'score is chilling and powerful. James Horner take some
music of Goldsmith in Aliens.<br /><br />Warning: people who like a lot of gore, nonsense story and full of action
(explosions) will maybe not like Alien. Alien is more a slow thriller than
an action movie. But YOU MUST SEE IT.<br /><br />-Ripley to Ash &quot;Ok, just get rid of him&quot;
