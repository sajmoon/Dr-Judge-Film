I didn't see this movie in its entirety until I was in college.  Home on
break, I saw it on HBO(starting at 1 am).  If you haven't seen this movie
before, and you're thinking of watching it, by all means, do so alone at
1am.  Horror movie directors now NEED to see this movie- the way for the
first 40 minutes nothing happens, and those are 40 of the most
nerve-wracking minutes I've ever seen.  Though, it has lost some of its
effect through repeated viewing.  A few scenes it's real obvious the alien
is a guy in a suit, but they do a good job of hiding this by keeping it off
camera for more than a second or two in all but one scene.<br /><br />All in all, a great creepy movie, followed by one good and 2 terrible
sequels.
