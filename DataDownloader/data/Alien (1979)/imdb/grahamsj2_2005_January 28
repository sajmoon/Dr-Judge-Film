This is the benchmark for Science Fiction films to aspire to attain.
The film's Director, Ridley Scott, already a &quot;known&quot;, was catapulted
into the forefront with this one, along with the entire cast. The
acting in this film is superb by the entire cast, but most especially
Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm. The fact that the entire
cast consists of only 9 or 10 characters must have made it easy to work
together. The special effects work is absolutely first-rate also. The
action comes thick and fast after a sort of slow but necessary start.
Once it begins, hold onto your hat! Alien is, far and away, the best
film of it's genre that I've seen in years.
