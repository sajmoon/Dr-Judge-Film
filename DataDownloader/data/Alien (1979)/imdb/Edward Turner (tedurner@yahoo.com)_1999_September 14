1999_September 14 

After 20 years, this is still the scariest and most suspenseful film I have
ever seen. I was left rather in the cold after seeing James Cameron's
sequel, Aliens, which is still very good, but can't hold a candle to Ridley
Scott's classic in terms of shear terror. Some people complain that Alien is
slow and thinking about it the pace of the actual script is leisurely. Yet
from the start Scott creates an atmosphere that you can cut with a knife and
moves the film along so that two hours pass by all too quickly. Its
basically a haunted house in space as Scott preys on everyone's primal fears
about the bogey man fear of the dark... and takes them too their extremes.
Production values art direction, SFX, Jerry Goldsmith's score and
performances from Weaver especially but also from British stars Ian Holm and
John Hurt (Until he gets serious tummy trouble) is impeccable. The famous
scene when the alien bursts out of his stomach still makes me feel queasy
and this is an objective exercise in understated direction and the fear of
the unknown (you don't see the creature until the very end) that is far
scarier than Cameron's 1986 blast fest. A classic. 10/10!<br /><br />
