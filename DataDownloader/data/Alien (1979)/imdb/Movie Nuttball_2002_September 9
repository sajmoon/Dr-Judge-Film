Alien is one of the greatest sci-fi films in my opinion and it has three
sequels. With a great story, good acting, and a lot of mystery I believe
this is the ultimate Alien movie.Sigourney Weaver`s first Alien film and I
don`t think it'll be her last.Alien has great music by Jerry Goldsmith!If
you are interested in seeing the Alien films for the first time I recommend
see this one first and then you can see how it all began. This is truly a
great film!
