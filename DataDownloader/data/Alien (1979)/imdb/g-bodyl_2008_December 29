This is a great movie, better than I expected. I say that because I am
not a fan of horror movies. Since this movie is involved in the sci-fi
genre, I decided to check this film out. I am glad I did.<br /><br />The plot is simple. It&#39;s about seven crew members aboard a spaceship
returning large amounts of mineral ore to Earth. Along the way, they
intercept an apparent SOS transmission. But little did the crew know
that the transmission is not an SOS, but an warning. One that will end
in devastation.<br /><br />The acting is great and believable led by Director Ridley Scott and
unknown actress Signourey Weaver. Scott is one of the best directors of
all time. Weaver did a great job with Ripley. I also give kudos to John
Hurt and Ian Holm, more great actors.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent. Especially for a movie released in
1979. In fact, It won best an Oscar for visual effects.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the when the alien popped out of the chest of one
guy. That was scary. I think I should check out the rest of the Alien
movies.<br /><br />I rate this movie 9/10.
