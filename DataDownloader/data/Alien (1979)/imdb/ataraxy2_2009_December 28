And so it begins... as vague shapes slowly form the letters... A L I E
N. A simple introduction but one suitable given the intensity that
follows.<br /><br />As I watched I realised ALIEN was giving me the most intense and
nerve-wracking experience film might ever offer to me - I was
frustrated at the sheer tension, the film was succeeding in awakening
within me paranoia and anxiety, it kept mounting and mounting, and I
kept anticipating and distressing. It was absolutely thrilling -
certainly one of the most enjoyable and exciting film experiences I&#x27;ve
ever had. If this comment encourages anyone to see the film under the
circumstances I did they have struck gold.<br /><br />The golden guidelines: 1. See the film without any prior knowledge...
at all. Even being born in 1992, it is still surprising that I hadn&#x27;t
heard anything about the movie beyond its status of &#x22;brilliant&#x22; and
&#x22;terrifying&#x22;. And I was lucky in this regard. Everything in the film
was a surprise to me, I didn&#x27;t know anything about the story and the
characters, or even the alien. I was familiar only with the poster art
&#x96; an egg. In a way it was as if I was there watching the film just how
people would have seen it in 1979.<br /><br />2. Night, home-alone, quiet. No distractions.<br /><br />3. Watch the &#x22;Theatrical Cut&#x22;. The Director&#x27;s Cut is inferior due to
the awkward placement of additional scenes that kill the suspense, and
the shortening of many scenes that work better with their original
lengths.<br /><br />If anyone reading this has managed to succeed in 1. then BY GOD rent
the film now! <br /><br />Alien is most certainly a masterpiece. A film that is capable of
creating such terror in its audience deserves that title. The set
designs are brilliant and succeed in setting the atmosphere and
creating reality; the work of H. R. Giger is impeccably disturbing and
suggestive; and technically, with the exception of one or two shots,
Alien has aged gracefully. I look back on my first watch with great
fondness, and I remember it vividly.<br /><br />It would be a shame to not allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying A L
I E N and ultimately you won&#x27;t know unless you try, but I tell you
this: It&#x27;s worth it.
