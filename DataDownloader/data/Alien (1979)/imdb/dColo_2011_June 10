Alien came out of nowhere at a time when everyone was crowding to
theaters to see Star Wars types, and showed us a much, much darker side
of space. You can see why a lot of people would want to see this, at a
time when sci-fi films were at a golden age, and sporting the coolest
tag line of any movie before or since. &#x22;In Space, No One Can Hear You
Scream.&#x22; In my opinion, any marketing team that can beat this deserves
a pay raise and a month off! <br /><br />What&#x27;s even better about the tag line is Alien&#x27;s ability to live up to
it. Ridley Scott, still relatively new to Hollywood at the time,
directs this movie like a pro, jacking up the tension during pivotal
scenes until you can barely handle it, and then deciding whether or not
to scare us or to slow things back down again, and the end result is a
real treat. One could think of Alien as a traditional haunted house
story, except the house is actually a giant spaceship and the ghost is
actually a sleek, stealthy, and damn scary alien.<br /><br />As far as acting is concerned, Alien is once again a step ahead of most
horror movies, swapping the traditional two-dimensional stereotypes for
genuine characters, who you can care about, be scared for and be sad
for when they get killed (lot of that going on here). this is helped
along by great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm,
Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton.
Weaver, in particular, is fantastic as the plucky heroine Ripley, now
hailed as one of the most iconic heroes of all time. Sigourney Weaver
has had a great career, but her performance in Alien - not to mention
her Oscar-nominated turn in the sequel - still remains the highlight.<br /><br />I presume you already know about the infamous Chestburster scene, but
if you don&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t ruin it for you. There is a reason though, that
this sequence has had the impact it&#x27;s had. It&#x27;s more than just another
shock tactic. It&#x27;s a fact that deep down, men are slightly unnerved by
birth. It&#x27;s always an uncomfortable thing for us to see. What Alien
does to male audiences is that is shows them OTHER MEN giving birth,
and that concept scares the crap out of them! <br /><br />10/10 - Masterpiece
