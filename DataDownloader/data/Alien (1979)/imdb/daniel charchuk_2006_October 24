Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting
the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott
hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or
buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly
effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it&#39;s
unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps
the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn&#39;t look
dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still
scary. Great performances too, and a good script, making this much more
than just a monster flick.
