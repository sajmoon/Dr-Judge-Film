Where to start? This is alien The best horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen.Its
not like the horror movies they make these days (full of nonsense) It
may not have much blood or action, but at the moments the alien appears
you really feel it, SCARY! I think this is one of the best, or the best
horror creature ever created. This movie is like The godfather trilogy,
and the star wars Original trilogy. IT WILL NEVER DIE! An absolutely
one to watch! I would say go and watch it with your girlfriend:P it
really helps. personal rating ***** out of ***** this movie is really
dark that makes the movie very strong at scare moments. You have my
sympathies.... Ash (alien)
