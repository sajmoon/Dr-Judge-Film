This movie was a turning point in terror and sci-fi genre, it was smart,
stylish, violence and gory. It had everything to make a great sci-fi
thriller and everyone should see it. Sigourney Weaver is sensational as
Ellen Ripley. This is a must see movie!
Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence and gore, and for some
language.
