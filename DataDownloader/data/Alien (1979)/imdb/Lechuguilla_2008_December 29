A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative &quot;sci-fi&quot;
flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a
Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about
this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer
screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot
filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite
incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET
shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug
in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and
incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.<br /><br />But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably
to escape the crew&#39;s incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where
did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope,
he&#39;s in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is
condemned.<br /><br />I&#39;m constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by
conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects.
Where in this film is a sense of the cosmic? Where is the originality?
Where is the science fiction in all of this?
