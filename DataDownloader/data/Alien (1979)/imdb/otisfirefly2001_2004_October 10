This movie can instantly be called a classic. While the world was busy
enjoying the lovable, cuddly E.T. This movie was released. This movie
definitely sent shock waves through the bouls of film making, and still
gets audiences attention today. <br /><br />Ridley Scott really outdid himself with this movie, rivaled only(in my
opinion) by the job he did on Hannibal. The camera work is fantastic,
The special effects are surprisingly good for a movie from the late
70's, the acting is top notch most notably from Siqourney Weaver as Lt.
Ellen Ripley.<br /><br />Not much else can be said about this movie classic. <br /><br />I would strongly recommend this movie to any who have not yet viewed
it. If you are looking for thrills, look no further then ALIEN.
