ALIEN was and still is one of the Best Sci-fi/Horror movies ever made
thanks to the wonderful team involved with making it, (Ridley Scott,H.R
Giger, Dan O&#39;bannon, etc..) a marriage made in Hollywood heaven. As the
title suggests ALIEN was truly alien and did not humanise or turn it
into a bug hunt like it&#39;s sequel did, I did enjoy Alien3 more than
Aliens and Alien resurrection and I almost forgot Aliens versus
Predator, in those there were way too many other people around to make
it scary, in space everyone can hear you scream especially Newt. James
Cameron is a great action movie director and that&#39;s what he turned
Aliens into a commandos in space with typical bad ass Hollywood lingo
that aged very badly because it was so imitated so often. Sequels are
supposed to answers brought up by the original and non of them
did...Like where did the aliens come from?
