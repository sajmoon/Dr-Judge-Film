Alien is easily the greatest sci-fi horror movie. Weaving strong themes of
suspense, fear, and the omnipresent darkness, Ridley Scott has created a
masterpiece. The cinematography is profound, the acting is strong without
being cheesy, the special effects are surprisingly good, and the alien
itself is amazing. H R Giger has been influenced by an oceanic lifeform
called the Phronima, and modelled the beast on this tiny organism, to great
effect. The drool factor, while not fully controlled in this one, is still
gross in a cool way, and there's so much fun in watching the behind the
scenes footage. I highly recommend this for serious collections.
