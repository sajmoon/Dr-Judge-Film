I haven't read all the comments here but apparently noone asked the
obvious
question: How can the alien grow so fast? The film is almost in real
time,
and in a couple of hours the little squeeker has turned into an 8 foot
behemoth.<br /><br />And then it stops. None of the aliens (except for the queens) ever gets
taller than that. And most of them in &quot;Aliens&quot; were probably much older
than
the one in &quot;Alien&quot;. Now every medical man would agree: popping up in
height
like that would give you serious joint and coordination
problems.<br /><br />Ridley Scott calls it &quot;exotic biomechanoid&quot;. Oh, NOW I get
it.<br /><br />One other thing: I can see why activating the self construction program
for
the ship is such an elaborate procedure. But turning it off again? There
should be a simple Esc key in case you change your mind or forgot
your wallet. Man, this space ship engineer obviously has never been
chased
by an alien AND had to rescue a cat at the same time.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is a milestone in suspense cinema. It blew me away 20 years ago
and
never stopped amazing me since. But if you want to maintain it's fright
factor full force, don't watch the &quot;Making of&quot;.
