Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to
actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even
if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still
have been worth it to watch the original Alien.<br /><br />What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the
first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is
incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is
also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how
to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly
perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a
very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring
on the Aliens, bitch!
