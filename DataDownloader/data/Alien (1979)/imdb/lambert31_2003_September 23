Seven people along for a deadly ride, with only four of them driving.
Those
seven are the crew in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror film Alien, which was
his
directorial debut. Let me start with Kane, whom we see first rising from
his
cryogenic tube like a vampire from a coffin. Man, you're going to have a
BAD
day. John Hurt (Rob Roy) acted capably in this film; sadly there isn't
much
for his character to do except die horribly. Kane is the first driver
though, and all the crew's sorrows begin with him: a man whose curiosity
costs more than just his life. Isn't he lucky to have friends like
Lambert,
a character apprehensive from the start, and Dallas? Veronica Cartwright
(The Birds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Witches of Eastwick) is
flawless in her part, as no one else can seem so realistically terrified.
Tom Skerritt does fine as Dallas also, although I've only seen him in this
movie. They risk their lives rushing Kane back to the infirmary, carrying
him like a corpse, which is fitting since he is already dead. Lambert and
Dallas don't know that yet. Their hope is blind. Too bad Ash doesn't have
Kane's best interests in mind. This has to be Ian Holm's (The Fifth
Element,
Fellowship of the Ring) most chilling performance yet! I've said enough.
You
know how the story proceeds from here.<br /><br />
