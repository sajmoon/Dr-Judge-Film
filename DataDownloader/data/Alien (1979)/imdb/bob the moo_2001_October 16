The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the
unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this
one.<br /><br />It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing
the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a
mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to
approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series
late.<br /><br />It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking
so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are
still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek
vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his
secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is &quot;born&quot;
the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a
formula we know oh-so well now!)<br /><br />However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some
dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of
great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course
the real star is the one we see least of.<br /><br />We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in
shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing
machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap
a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive
movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member
sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure
cruelty.<br /><br />The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other
films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a
new level.<br /><br />
