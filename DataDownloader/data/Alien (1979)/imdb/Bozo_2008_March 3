2008_March 3 
This was a very different movie for its time. Most sci-fi movies were
cheaply made in the 70s and had poor acting and things like that from
what I can tell. Then Alien came along and sci-fi was changed from that
point on. The acting here was first-rate and flawless. They used
big-name actors to fill the parts in this movie such as Tom Skerritt,
Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt. The only person who
I thought was very annoying and poorly played was Veronica Cartwright&#39;s
character, Lambert. I wanted her to be killed so she would shut up.
Everyone else was perfect though. The story was excellent and well
thought out. The costumes and FX were very good for 1979. I would
recommend this movie for horror and sci-fi fans, you will enjoy it.
8/10.
