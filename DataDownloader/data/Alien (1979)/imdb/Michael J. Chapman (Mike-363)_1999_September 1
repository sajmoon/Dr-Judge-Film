1999_September 1 

A great cast, a great director, great special effects all team up to keep
you on the edge of your seat almost the entire movie.  I was physically
tired at the end of this movie from being tensed up.  It's first sequel,
Aliens, was also a superior movie.  The rest of the sequels should not
have
been made.  The thing that struck me at the time this move was released
(1979?) was that the Alien looked alien, not just a humanoid figure with
different facial features.  The inner set of choppers that slid out to
take
a bite out of you was innovative and very effective.  A must see
movie.
