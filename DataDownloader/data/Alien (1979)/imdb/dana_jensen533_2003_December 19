The reason &quot;Alien&quot; was and is so popular is because if you go back to 1979,
the movie going public had never seen anything like the Alien creature in
all of cinema history. It paved the way for MANY Sci-Fi movies, and for the
last 24 years Hollywood has tried to capture the magic of &quot;Alien&quot;. Want
proof? How many films can you think of that are a rip-off of &quot;Alien&quot;
(Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and many many others). I'm afraid only &quot;Alien&quot;
will stand the test of time. I suggest all fans of the &quot;Alien&quot; series buy
the new &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; DVD Collection.
