There are not so many movies, which I&#39;m craving to have in my DVD
collection, but &quot;Alien&quot; is definitely one of them. It is grim and
tough, it is dark and surreal, it is violent and freaky, it is
thought-provoking and mesmerizing. You can try to make fun of it, but
you cannot hurt its reputation of a solid sci-fi, because there are so
few movies of this calibre. Like in case with &quot;Terminator&quot; I do not
like the following &quot;part&quot;: &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot; turned the
initial concepts into &quot;shoot-&#39;em-all&quot; parody.<br /><br />Atmosphere of loneliness and constant danger is created and being kept
up all through the movie. One wrong actor could have ruined it all but
the director made the right choice. Every actor is in its place and
performs very well.<br /><br />I agree with those IMDb reviewers who mention that &quot;Aliens&quot; destroyed
the original concept. Damn right. &quot;Alien&quot;, as I see it, was never about
a war of marines vs. hordes of ETs. &quot;Alien&quot; was about our fears and
loneliness, about such moments in our life when no living man, even
with a big plasma rifle or whatever, can help you, and you have to
fight for yourself.<br /><br />I&#39;m very grateful to our DVD market that it lets us buy &quot;Alien&quot; movies
separately. I would never buy the &quot;Alien quadrology&quot;, because the
quality of all the parts is extremely different.<br /><br />10 out of 10 - triumph of sci-fi genre. Thank you for attention.
