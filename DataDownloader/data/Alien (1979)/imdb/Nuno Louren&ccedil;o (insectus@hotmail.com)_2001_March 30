This movie is probably one the greatest sci-fi milestones ever made. The
plot seems very simple, and indeed it is. But this is not in anyway a
plot
driven movie. What makes this movie great are its environments brought to
life by a flawless and genius direction by Ridley Scott. The characters,
all built by strong performances, specially by Tom Skerrit, Sigourney
Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt, seem completely convincing as 22nd
century
people crewing the &quot;Nostromo&quot;, a titanic starship. When the appearance of
the
alien comes, the designs made by H.R. Giger are quite notable, making the
creature itself also a milestone in horror and sci-fi. The only problem I
can see in the movie is the fast pace of the end sequence that leaves
behind
the questions about the nature of the creature itself, that as a scene
shows, is a reflection on a broken mirror of humanity itself. That
doesn't
stop it from being a great movie.
