One of the reasons for the brilliance of the film, despite some of the
silly, carping criticisms of it the Halliwell Film Guide, is that it
creates and maintains throughout the Gothic features, although updated,
which we find in many of the Gothic stories popular in the 18th and
early 19th Centuries. Like many of them, &#39;Alien&#39; is largely set in one
location and the characters cannot escape from the other-wordly menace
that threatens them. I consider it a masterpiece of the SF/Horror
genre, and still, despite its many good challengers, the best. I first
got interested in it years ago when I read a magazine article about
Giger, the creator of the extraordinary &#39;artwork&#39;, including creatures,
alive and dead, in the film. I read the book, saw the film, and for me,
as for many since, &#39;the rest is history,&#39; as they say.
