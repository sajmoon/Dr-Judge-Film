Ridley Scott has created only the truest form of fear in movie history.
This film shows what if you were in space... alone. No one can hear
you, no one can save you. You are stuck with a monster tormenting you
knowing that you have no chance.<br /><br />It is hard to know that there is someone out for your blood, but for it
to possibly be in the next room with no where else for you to go. You
can make one wrong move, resulting in yours and possibly your crew's
death. How would you like that? This is why this remains only one of
the scariest sci-fi movies.<br /><br />Because in space, no one can hear you scream.
