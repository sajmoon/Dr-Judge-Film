Before The Terminator series and Avatar, Ridley Scott gave his best to
scare the wits out of me in this imaginative sci-fi horror &#x22;Alien&#x22;.
Once you combine a dinosaur egg with scientific experiments, you get
one horrifying and very nasty looking alien.<br /><br />The only problem that I do have with this movie was the slow pacing but
it gives our characters some development/screen time.<br /><br />The acting was excellent. Every Sigourney Weaver movie you see, &#x22;Galaxy
Quest&#x22;, &#x22;Holes&#x22;, &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, you name it. She was very good at her
performance.<br /><br />The darker tone of the movie was very solid and the science was very
interesting to let me know what&#x27;s going on.<br /><br />The special effects were very unique and the sound effects were solid.
Even the directing from Ridley Scott was creative and the visuals were
good.<br /><br />Ridley is a very good director and made another good movie known as The
Gladiator 21 years later in the early 2000 and this movie is one of the
greatest sci-fi horror movies ever made. Thumbs Up.<br /><br />9.4 out of 10
