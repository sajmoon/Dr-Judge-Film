1999_March 29 

This tagline changed the face of science fiction movies for decades. Alien
was released in 1979 and was the first and the best of four films to hit the
big screen. The commercial starship Nostromo is returning to Earth with
20,000,000 tons of mineral ore when its main central computer, &quot;Mother&quot;,
interrupts the journey and informs the crew that they must investigate a
distress signal coming from planet LV-426. When three crew members go and
search the surface for this signal, one of them ends up with something on
his face, a parasite or facehugger. Later on, it falls off of his face and
he seems to be fine but little did anyone know that the facehugger planted
an Alien inside his body, which bursts from his chest in a shocking scene.
As the remaining crew members hunt for the creature, it has shed its skin
and grown into a very scary creature. It kills each crew member until only
Ellen Ripley is left, which leads to a final showdown in a small shuttle she
escapes in after detonating the Nostromo.
Alien is so much more entertaining than any of its successors. It has the
claustrophobic atmosphere, characters you care about and Ellen Ripley
(Sigourney Weaver) at her finest! She uses her wits and intelligence to kill
the creature, not machine guns and grenades like in &quot;Aliens&quot;. Everyone puts
in a great performance. The best characters in the film were Ash, the
traitorous android, Parker, Rambo-like tough guy and of course Ripley. All
in all, Alien is one intense film. Suspenseful and very scary. Stands apart
big time from the other 3 films that followed it.
