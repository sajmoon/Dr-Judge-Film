My Take: A gripping sci-fi thriller that hides in the dark and leaps at
you when you least expect it. <br /><br />(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)<br /><br />If Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY revolutionized what we
conceived of science fiction movies, then Ridley Scott&#x27;s ALIEN is the
2001 of monster pictures. Here&#x27;s a movie that takes something familiar
(something as old as a space monster and the doomed interstellar crew
in preys on) and serves the formula right. Add a touch of effective
atmosphere and suspense courtesy of the slimiest, most streamlined
monster in movie history since the shark from JAWS and you got a
classic. I read a review of this film where the critic described ALIEN
as a haunted house movie set in the infinity of space. I couldn&#x27;t think
of a better way to describe it. <br /><br />It is in this film that we are introduced to the familiar plot (as of
today) about crew members of commercial ship who come upon an alien
roaming around their ship, killing them of one by one. This plot would
soon be borrowed by other Sci-fi films, but only &#x22;Alien&#x22; does it right.
Pretty unique for its kind. Unique too, is the film&#x27;s use of
super-advance technology, pretty new back then. The film is one of the
first to exhibit the cryogenic sleep in space. I haven&#x27;t seen anything
as unique as that.<br /><br />The film does all the Sci-fi things right, and even goes beyond its
knowledge. Ridley Scott does it with great creativity, making up for
some little-known flaws in the film. Little-known because Scott does
what needs to be done, and done right.<br /><br />Rating: ***** out of 5.
