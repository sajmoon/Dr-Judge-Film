2004_February 26 
A brilliant, terrifying film with outstanding acting from a premium
Anglo-American cast. Could be a metaphor for some anti-Freudian demon.
Could be a pessimist's reasoned extrapolation of science-fact. Could be
a surreal soap-opera episode. It could be a cold war allegory. It's all
these things.<br /><br />It's also desperately bleak. There's little love and the relationships
between the characters, strained at the beginning, become terminal
fissures as the show progresses. It's got as much existential punch as
Kubrick's 2001 but it mainlines it in the way that Star Wars did for
'the Force' (i.e. as device, not the issue). Added to the committed
execution of the idea are Giger's bizarre designs and an extraordinary
techno-free production inventiveness which lifts the tale out of the
NASA's-latrine surroundings and into the imagination. Oh, and as Ridley
Scott is at pains to point out in the DVD commentary(!), Jerry
Goldsmith brilliant (understated) score.<br /><br />Not the scary movie to impress a date at. 8/10
