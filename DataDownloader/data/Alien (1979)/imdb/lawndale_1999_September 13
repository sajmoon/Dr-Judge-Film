1999_September 13 

Actually, &quot;Alien&quot; has a lot more going for it than just the bountiful supply
of unsettling subtext. But it's the subtext that holds the film together to
its satisfactory resolution.<br /><br />This film is brilliantly directed. Unlike its three successors (especially
the second and fourth installments of the series), this film knows that the
alien will be much more terrifying if it's never actually seen in its
entirety. It can be seen descending from the shadows or in horrifying
ultra-close-ups, but you don't get the &quot;full body&quot; alien shot until very
late in the film, making &quot;the perfect organism&quot; all the more mysterious and
frightening. <br /><br />Many members of the ADHD generation claim that the movie is boring-- and
that simply isn't true. &quot;Alien&quot; actually BUILDS to it's action-oriented
sequences; it has much more to say and takes much less for granted than does
its overblown sequel. <br /><br />During the first 'movement' of &quot;Alien,&quot; you're forced to contemplate the
mechanics behind what exactly is happening to the crew of the Nostromo. The
implications that a crew would be 'expendable' to a corporation has
fundamentally TERRIFYING ramifications for an unsettling direction in which
our society is headed. When Mother actually processes that particular
transmission, you must reconsider what had been presented earlier-- and the
results are not pretty.<br /><br />Veronica Cartwright gives a particularly affecting performance here. Of all
the characters, she seems the most genuinely terrified as she attempts to
understand why this horrible creature has come into her life. The other
performances are all solid, if somewhat unremarkable, as
well.<br /><br />Rating: 8 out of 10. A classic, but it looks VERY dated-- unlike &quot;Aliens,&quot;
the f/x and the dialogue haven't held up particularly well. More character
development would have given the film even more emotional impact and would
have heightened the intensity of the otherwise well-developed theme.
Tasteful restraint of gore. The direction of Ripley's final scene is
especially dazzling. The second-best film in the series, just behind the
gorgeous &quot;Alien 3.&quot;
