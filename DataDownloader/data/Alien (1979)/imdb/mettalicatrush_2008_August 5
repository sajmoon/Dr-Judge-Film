Scott&#39;s vision of hostile aliens paved the way for many lesser
directors to portray hostile alien lifeforms but barring a few none
have been able to create the same amount of horror as Alien did.<br /><br />A strange signal on an off-world leads the humans straight into the
path of a species which is parasitic in nature and evolved to the
extent of being the perfect killing machines.<br /><br />The movie might be science fiction on the outset but plays out like a
edge-of-the-seat horror. Thankfully the lack of CGI forces the special
effects crew and Scott to exploit lighting, sound and clever editing to
the full extent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Alien franchisee has been murdered by the studio and
is now a joke. Its foolish to wait for the studio to ever redeem
themselves, so horror fans, accept that 1979 was as good as it gets and
watch the reruns as often as possible.
