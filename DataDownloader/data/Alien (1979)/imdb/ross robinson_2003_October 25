Alien i think has got to be a classic horror movie. This was the first ever
Alien movie, it was made and filmed in 1979. Sigorney Weaver is a fantastic
actress i think. She was good in all of the Alien movies. In 2004 there will
be a release of ALIEN: 25th anniversary addition to buy because it will be
25 years since the actor and actresses starred in the alien
film.
