Alien (1979, Dir. Ridley Scott) <br /><br />When a mining ship lands on a planet to investigate upon a suspected
SOS, the entire crew are unaware of the terror which they would unleash
upon their ship. When a alien life-form attach&#39;s itself to the face of
crew member, Kane, the rest of the team act fast to try and separate
the two organisms. Unbeknownst to everyone, this is the start of the
terror which would affect every member of the seven person crew.<br /><br />After watching &#39;Alien&#39; it&#39;s not hard to see that nearly 30 years later,
it still has the ability to scare you. The story is simple and has been
used in countless films since the introduction of &#39;Alien&#39;, but this is
not what makes it great. Firstly, there&#39;s a small number of characters
featured within this film. The are seven human characters in the film.
Whilst this might seem like a small number, it does actually give a
chance to add a lot of character to each individual, and add to the
fright factor. Too many characters give the alien a disadvantage. The
special effects are basic and so convincing, with only slight
appearances of the alien to tease everyone. Do to being a fan of
movies, i have large knowledge of what happens behind the scenes. The
disadvantage of this, is that i rarely get spooked by movies anymore,
but this was an exception. I literally jumped when the alien appeared
in the dark. If you want a go at a classic fright fest, then choose
this.<br /><br />&quot;We have Parker. Can Brett be far behind?&quot; - Kane (John Hurt)
