Alien i think should at least be in 5th in the top 250 list,why well
great acting great effects great script and of course the directing by
ridley scott.Well of course you have to give credit to Giger who made
the the eggs the alien and the design of the ship.His work looks like
it was made by the devil.And Danobanon for writing it.He first got the
idea of this movie from darkstar which was the comedy he wrote.He
wanted to name this move darkstar but decided to name it alien
instead.And how about Sigourney Weaver,one of the best performances
ever,it should be remembered for ever.the movie is also loaded with
horror and suspense.id suggest you see this movie especially the
directors cut.
