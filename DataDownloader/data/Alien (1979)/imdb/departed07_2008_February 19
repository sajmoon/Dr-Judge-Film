&quot;In space, no one can hear you scream.&quot; <br /><br />While Halloween was the sister to Psycho in slasher pictures, in 1979
director Ridley Scott made a motion picture of what it would be like to
be somewhere where people wouldn&#39;t hear you screaming if you were being
chase by an evil monster.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; takes place in space where a group of miners led by Dallas,
played by Tom Skerritt, land on a strange colony from another planet
where they think that all would be normal until they discover that a
group of eggs are laid on the floor with Kane (John Hurt) attacked by a
spider-like creature before being knocked out for a while. Members of
the crew include Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica
Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm) and Parker
(Yaphet Katto) where they want to know what kind of creature is on
Kane&#39;s head before seeing a special surprise at the dinner table.<br /><br />Later in the film, a new monster takes place inside the spaceship where
it goes after the crew members one by one leaving only a matter of time
before everybody dies.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is a landscape in horror survival where it plays like a silent
motion picture where we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next. It&#39;s
creepy, very effective, and it&#39;s the kind of film you don&#39;t want to
watch in the dark.
