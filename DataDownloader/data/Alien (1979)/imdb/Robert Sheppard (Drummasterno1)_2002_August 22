I love this film.  It has to be one of the best ever.  It has so many
groundbreaking parts that remade the genre of science fiction movies.  The
famous Chestbursting scene is amazing.  It is scary and also very
realistic.
The movie also sticks to the story and does not let up on the suspense.  If
you have never seen this movie, go see it. I give Alien a 9 out of 10
rating.
