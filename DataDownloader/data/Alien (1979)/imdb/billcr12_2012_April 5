Alien is the equivalent of watching paint dry. A spaceship is traveling
back to earth with a valuable mineral from another planet. They receive
a signal from outer space of unknown origin. Time to investigate this
mystery. <br /><br />The crew find a dead alien inside a space craft and when the chamber is
opened it is filled with eggs. One hatches and a tiny creature attaches
itself to one of the astronauts face. Unable to remove the critter, it
finally falls off on its own. <br /><br />The man who has survived the baby monster is eating dinner with his
crew mates when an alien bursts from is stomach and runs away, hiding
in the star trek enterprise. The uninvited guest kills some of his
fellow travelers and further battles ensue. In between, there is a good
amount of brooding. Alien is a two hour drag.
