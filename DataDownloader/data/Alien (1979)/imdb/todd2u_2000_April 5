This is the beginning of one of the best movies trilogy. This and the
first
one is my favorite of the four. Alien is a true classic. I really like
this
movie. It had great acting, and not to mention great special effects. For
a
movie that was made in the late 70s it had good effects.I recommend this
film to anyone who likes Science Fiction movies and a creepy
Alien.
