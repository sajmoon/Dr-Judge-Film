1999_June 7 

This movie really impressed me for one thing....the introduction of the
ALIEN....no cute spielbergian ET ,no grey colored big eyed dwarfs like in
the X-files.I'm sure if we ever encounter Aliens in real life they will
look
like this creature,black, slimy,eyeless and insectious ...and that double
fanged mouth...brilliant!This creature is our nightmares visualized in
latex.<br /><br />The movie on the other hand is pretty good,the ensamble
acting
is great and the fx are very good.But there are some very slow spots,but
all
that is rectified once the creature starts having lunch on the crew
members.Good movie but Aliens is better.
