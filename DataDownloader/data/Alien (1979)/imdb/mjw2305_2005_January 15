A classic movie is one that can stand the test of time. Alien does and
it still looks stylish, even when it is compared to many movies that
have borrowed ideas from it.<br /><br />What you don&#39;t see, scares you more, a premise that is very often
attempted but rarely works. Ridley Scott managed to pull this off with
style, he got the balance exactly right and the result is terrifying.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was an inspired selection as the now legendary
character &#39;Ripley&#39; (probably the first female action hero, certainly
the best) and the supporting cast are all more than adequate.<br /><br />I can&#39;t deny that this film has dated a little, but when compared to
other Sci Fi/Horror movies of the same era, you really can see how
awesome this movie is. An undoubted classic that will terrify audiences
for decades to come.<br /><br />9/10 and they may be a little harsh
