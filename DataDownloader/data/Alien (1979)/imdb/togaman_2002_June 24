Just as the alien in question is the perfect killing machine, &quot;Alien&quot; the
movie is the perfect science fiction movie. The story, dialogue and acting
are superb. The special effects (pre-digital) hold up well by today's
standards.  There is no weak link in the ensemble cast and Sigourney Weaver
is the consumate protagonist. The set was almost a character of its own and
was much copied but never equalled in later, lesser movies.
