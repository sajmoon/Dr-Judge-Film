This is the ultimate sci-fi film of the century! It has a crap version
of the alien but Ridley scott made the film about suspense so you know
the alien is there but not see him till near the end. I saw the
directors cut and thought the scenes that were cut should have been
left in, especially where ripleys just activated the self destruct and
finds dallas and brett in a cocoon state, which would explain the
cocoons in ALIENS and why ripley freaks out when the marines find them.
Parker was the funniest of the crew the way him and brett scare each
other after letting the cat jonesy out the locker when looking for the
alien. My favorite scene is where ripleys heading back to the shuttle
and the alien id in the corridor and the music and suspense kicks in,
that an ultimate scene.I also liked the bit where ripley trys to
de-activate it and mother does not accept the abort sequence and ripley
says &quot; you bitch&quot;..&quot; ohhh&quot; and whacks mother one.
