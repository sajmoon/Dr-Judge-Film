Alien is classic for a few reasons. For one: it is a rare beast, so
emotionally and incredibly involving that when you stop watching it you
have to emerge from the world you were in. Two: it defined the genre, a
gory space horror that remains shocking today. And three: it is one of
the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />We know little about the Nostromo when it first appears in that
isolated place called space: only that it has 7 passengers and is
heading towards earth. We are soon introduced to the characters,
already on a mission as they receive a distress call from an unknown
planet. A few are reluctant to go, but they are forced to (mainly
because of the incredibly dominating Ash) unaware of the horror that
awaits them...<br /><br />I guess human instinct and interest must have got the best of them,
because instead of instantly fleeing and at the sight of a beast that
was once alive (that stands an enormous hight) they enter it. Then do
they flee? No. They go deeper. And deeper.<br /><br />Squeamish people may very well want to keep what I say in mind. There
is some shocking, jumpy stuff here, making even the hardest jump and
genuinely fear for the lives of these fictional characters, despite
their evident stupidity. A pillow may be handy nearby.<br /><br />Though we don't know why at the time, Ash develops a huge interest in
these aliens, and seems completely intent on keeping them alive,
unaware of the immense danger it will lead these passengers to live
through. Despite having a face-hugger strapped across his face Kane
(John Hurt) is let through without being bacteria-free checked,
endangering the others more than himself. The chest burster scene will
prove my point.<br /><br />The thing is, though this may not seem incredible, there just isn't a
lot wrong with it. The script, acting and storyline are brilliant, and
the tension is unbelievable and, nearing the end, unbearable. The
constant feeling of fear twists in the pit of your stomach, and though
the outcome may be slightly evident, you can't help feeling genuine
fear and sorrow for these people and hope for their survival.<br /><br />Along with that, it ask interesting political questions, aimed at
government agencies and other undercover special forces. I wish not to
reveal these (mainly for public enjoyment) but keep an ear close and
handy and you will see what I mean. It is both daring and intelligent.<br /><br />Sigourny Weaver (playing Ripley) is incredible, her performance
completely real and believable. This film is not isolated like the
characters stuck in it: this is a bold, in your face film that demands
seeing. A masterpiece of modern (and old) cinema.<br /><br />**** out of **** (4 out of 4)
