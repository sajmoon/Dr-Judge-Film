Ridley Scott has made several masterpieces and I find him a very skilled
director. This was his first (major) film and after seeing Aliens and Alien
3 I decided to rent this hoping to get it on DvD (only found on VHS). And
boy was it good. The performances were better then average - good material
from Weaver, Kheto, and especially Holm. The special effects were excellent
as well but the best part is the Alien rarely came out which added to the
horror effect. Scare wise this movie has its good share of surprising
moments that'll sure make you jump. Visual wise this movie is impressive but
not as impressive as Blade Runner. It has a good ship design and some cool
looking Alien effects. I feel that this was the best of the 3 (I haven't
seen Ressurection). It had the most horror in it and the most originality.
Aliens was your above average shoot 'em up and Alien 3 was lacking. I highly
recomend this to anyone who is a fan of Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver, or
just plain damn good movies in general!
