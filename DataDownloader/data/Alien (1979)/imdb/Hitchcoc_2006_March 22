This is the ultimate fright fest. From the planet these junk dealers
come to, to the appearance of the monster and subsequent events, this
is one wild ride. First of all, there is a bleakness and an eeriness.
These people are on a salvage mission, trying to bring things back to
sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down
to the planet, they have not been told what lies there. There is a
darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star
Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge.
When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his
face, we know that there is something coming. The scene following is
one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive
way). The alien is a true threat, dripping corrosive venom and poison
blood, terrorizing the ship, leaving one person to combat it. If there
is a more claustrophobic, terrifying movie than this, I'd like to know
what it is. The other Alien movies don't quite make the grade because
they draw on way too much of the same thing and it seems forced.
