I've seen this classic science fiction many times, yet it still tenses me
up.<br /><br />Originally a 'sleeper',&quot;Alien&quot; launched Sigourney Weaver's career,
(unfortunately she went ahead a did two 'horrible' sequels) and went on to
almost cult-classic status.<br /><br />Ridley Scott masterfully directs the screen adaptation of the science
fiction best seller, with (almost) Hitchcock like suspense, and a
'white-knuckle' ending.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a out-of-this-world unique science fiction, then
by all means see 'it'.<br /><br />
