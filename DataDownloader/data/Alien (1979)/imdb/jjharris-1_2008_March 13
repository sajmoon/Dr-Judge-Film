Alien gets the sci-fi/suspense/horror mixture perfectly right. I&#39;ve
seen this film many times and it still gets me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />The sets are brilliant. The dilapidated, dark and gritty Nostromo is
the perfect setting for the suspenseful hunt of the Alien (or it&#39;s hunt
of the crew, if you prefer.) The music is hauntingly simplistic, but
builds the appropriate tension at all of the right moments.<br /><br />The cast is excellent! What more can be said. All of the actors have
tremendous performances.<br /><br />The story elements are great. Plenty of plot twists and development.<br /><br />Of course, the suspense is so heavy that even after seeing this film
numerous times I can&#39;t relax while watching it, even at 3:00pm on a
sunny afternoon.<br /><br />This is what great film-making is all about!
