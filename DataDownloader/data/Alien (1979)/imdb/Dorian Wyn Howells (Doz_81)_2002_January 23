The title gives away what this film is about.<br /><br />The film builds perfectly, and the limited cast of 7 all do well in this
film, but there are two stars...Weaver as Ripley and the Alien itself. I
would give anything to have seen this film on it's release! This probably
scared the hell out of anyone who went to see it!!<br /><br />The film is full of tension, and the bleak, dark, and creaking Nostromo is
a
vast hiding place for an Alien that we as an audience and the crew have no
acquired info on. It's a new breed and a vicious one at that! Of course
the
Government KNOW about it's existence (they would wouldn't they!!!) and the
ships computer - Mother - mis-informs (or lies as I would put it!!) the
crew
to go down onto a planet to answer a distress call!! They think their
answering a distress call, but it's a warning....oooops!!!<br /><br />The imagination surrounding the film's concept has to be acknowledged,
it's
a work of art on all levels. From concept, through to design, and the
Alien
itself is just terrifying!<br /><br />Ridley Scott handles this film perfectly, he sets up a claustraphobic
atmosphere in most of his scenes and the tension gets almost
unbearable!<br /><br />The main scenes are of course the 'chest bursting' scene and the
introduction to the Alien. The scene where Tom Skerritt (Dallas) crawls
through those tunnels and eventually meets the Alien. Who knew that a
small
'bleep' on a computer screen could create sooooooo much tension???!!!!
Well,
it does! The final 20 minutes is also a piece of great cinema. Avoid
though
if you are epileptic, 'cause there's a scene towards the end that will
definitely give you a fit! (I'm being sincere! I wouldn't joke about
that!)<br /><br />A great film, a landmark in horror and sci-fi films and it launched the
career of Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />Basically, you can't fault this film.<br /><br />Perfect 10!<br /><br />Enjoy!
