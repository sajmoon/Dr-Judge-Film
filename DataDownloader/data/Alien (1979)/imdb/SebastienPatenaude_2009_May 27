Maybe not as powerful and surprising today because we&#x27;ve become used to
that kind of film (becaused copied so many times) but back then it was
very fresh and surely terrifying. The tempo is slow but it works in
context and contributes to create suspense and intensify surprises. The
atmosphere and visual design are great and still look fine in the 21st
century (with a couple of exceptions: one being a particular &#x22;head&#x22;).
The premise of the film was like a B-movie but everything was done to
make it a quality A-movie including the actors who play seriously
without any &#x22;camp&#x22; factor. Sigourney Weaver, in her first movie role,
created a standard for strong female heroes that was extremely rare in
those days. The alien creature as designed by Giger was a stroke of
nightmarish genius recognizable and memorable amongst all others. It
was even more effective because it was glimpsed so quickly and
infrequently. Alien and the sequel Aliens have influenced tons of films
and video games afterwards, especially visually. It&#x27;s certainly a
classic in the sci-fi thriller genre and should be seen by everyone.
How I wish I could have seen it back in its heyday, but then perhaps I
would have been psychologically scarred forever by its chilling images
