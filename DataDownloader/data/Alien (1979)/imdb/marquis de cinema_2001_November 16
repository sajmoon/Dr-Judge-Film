One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story,
suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect.
Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how
Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space
Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science
fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological
reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett,
Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would
go
with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien
4(1998).<br /><br />The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by
HR
Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are
the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a
Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had
Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but
vurnable woman.<br /><br />Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror
from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975])
which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of
the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes
the
music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story.
Mozart's &quot;Eline Kleine Nachtmusik&quot; enforces the cold, expecting, and
unknown
fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling
horror and anticipating terror within the plot.<br /><br />Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with
brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the
death
of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members
discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene
between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too
bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt
in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert.
Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards
Ripley.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump
started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became
known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986).
Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three
film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than
Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science
Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The
Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch.
