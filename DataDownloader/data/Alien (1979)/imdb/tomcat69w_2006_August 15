What can I say that hundred&#39;s &amp; thousand&#39;s of people have not already
said or thought?! Well;...anyone who might have perused any of my posts
might know that Alien is my All-Time Favorite movie.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to have been alive and old enough to see it at the
theater&#39;s in 1979. And it was the single most entertaining movie
experience EVER! I saw Alien on it&#39;s first run. The tagline alone got
to me. &quot;In Space,...No One Can Hear You Scream!&quot; WOW! And for an
Adrenaline Rush that is non-stop,...this film Top&#39;s them all. I&#39;m sure
there are some who do not like this movie. I have read some of the
negative post&#39;s and just shake my head in silence. Ridley Scott became
my absolute all-time fave director with this one and secured that
position with Blade Runner. The movie may seem slow-paced to today&#39;s
audiences,...but it pay&#39;s off in spades for a little patience. This is
to me as perfect a film that has ever been made. Every aspect from
acting to dialogue, music to cinematography,...every detail makes this
a &quot;Classic&quot; and a solid 10/10 from me. If you have not seen Alien,...Go
Now! Rent it, Buy it. But make sure you are in the Dark cuddled up to a
Loved one for the Scariest Ride of Your Life! Simply The Very Best!
