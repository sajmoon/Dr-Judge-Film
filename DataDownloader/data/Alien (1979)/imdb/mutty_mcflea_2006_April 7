Two years after &#39;Star Wars&#39; redefined space as an epic battleground
full of bold characters, &#39;Alien&#39; swings in the opposite direction,
combining &#39;It! The Terror from Beyond Space&#39; and the writers&#39; own &#39;Dark
Star&#39; to bring us a galactic shipping lane full of ordinary bums just
doing their jobs. That&#39;s the interesting thing about the movie;
everything else, less so, bar the impressive production design.
Well-realised performances (particularly from Yaphet Kotto and Harry
Dean Stanton; Sigourney Weaver is wooden) service a screenplay filled
with dialogue so unmemorable that it barely registered as I listened to
it. The chestburster scene is WILDLY overrated: the alien, with its
jutting jaw, looks around as if it&#39;s itching for a fight, and then
zooms across the table in hilarious fashion, as if someone off-screen
has just yanked on a fishing line. Ridley Scott&#39;s direction is
occasionally too ponderous, trying to raise a brainier than average
monster movie to the status of art piece, and occasionally he succeeds
in creating a sullen and disquieting atmosphere, but all too often the
bleating sound recording and languorous pace do the movie a disservice.
The crashed ship, the dead pilot, the facehugger, and, of course, the
title creature itself, however, are deservedly applauded.
