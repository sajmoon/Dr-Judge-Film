Alien is an overrated film, but is still very suspenseful and gives some
good 
thrills at times. Ridley Scott does very good with the direction, and the
cast is 
good as well. The story takes place in space, with a ship investigating a
planet 
with a mysterious reading. When they reach the planet, something has entered<br /><br />the ship and is killing the crew off one by one. Sigourney Weaver and Tom<br /><br />Skerritt are good in the lead roles, while Yaphet Kotto, Veronica
Cartwright, and 
Ian Holm are also good. The movie has too many slow paced moments to<br /><br />actually be an exciting film. The sequel Aliens was superior. Alien is still
a good 
movie, but was somewhat disappointing. 8/10 stars.
