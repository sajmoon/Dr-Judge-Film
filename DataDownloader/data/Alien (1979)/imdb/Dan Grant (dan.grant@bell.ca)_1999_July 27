I think Aliens owes a lot of it's success to the original but it is a film
that stands on it's own.  Alien, however is a very terrifying film, it just
takes a little while to get there.  What is very good about the original is
that the set design is really one of the stars of the film.  Everything is
meticulously laid out before us and this adds to the element of fear that
Alien is famous for.  I have to say that Aliens scared me more that almost
any other film ever made and although I personally find Alien to be very
good, (but just a step under Cameron's version and vision) it has to be said
that this movie is very frightening and it is extremely well made.  There is
quite a bit of tension in here and it stars Tom Skerrit, that alone makes it
worth the price of a rental.  I think this is the perfect predecessor to
Aliens.  You should see this before you watch the second one.  They
complement each other perfectly.  And if you skipped the last two all
together, you would have a true feel of what good film making is all about. 
Alien is a very frightening film.
