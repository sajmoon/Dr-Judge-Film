Some people say there is no such thing as perfection, maybe not, but
ALIENS comes very close. This is a beautiful film, and as with a fine
wine, you need to prepare it correctly to enjoy it's uniqueness, i.e
NICE BIG SCREEN, NO LIGHTS, SURROUND SOUND, ON YOUR OWN (I would'nt
advise that with the wine though!)<br /><br />I remember when I first saw this film, I knew from the first 3 minutes
this was going to be something special, it is one of the most absorbing
films I have ever seen in the sense that it soaks you into the movie,
literally, hence why you should see it alone.<br /><br />The effects are fantastic, the sound is a dream, but it is the
atmosphere created from the incredible direction by ridley scott that
will make you feel you are part of this cursed crew.<br /><br />After I saw this film I followed everything that ridley scott did,
hoping for another taste of this magic, it never happened. I watched
the sequels 2,3 and 4 but was hugely disappointed, WHY? Because this is
the genuine article and the rest are fakes, as simple as that. Trying
to fake this film is like trying to fake the 'mona lisa' with felt
tips.<br /><br />--- DO NOT READ THIS NEXT CHAPTER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM---<br /><br />(SCROLL DOWN NOW ----------&gt;)<br /><br />The beginning of this film can never be equalled. The camera moving
around that sleeping ship, the helmet reflecting the distress signal,
the sound of that signal- just pure brilliance. The crew waking, the
chat around the table, mother, and the realisation that there 'not
home' paints a picture of deep space more vividly than any other film
has come close to. Thats just the start. The sound of the wind on that
planet, the craft, that alien in the chair - the size of it! The way
that alien craft was depicted, pure genius. I could go on and on.<br /><br />---------- OK YOU CAN READ ON NOW ------------------------<br /><br />Ridley is superb, they all are. Unlike the second film with those
pathetic marines, this is outstanding acting by all. The crew seem to
have been together for years, which is exactly how they should seem,
and scott has pulled it off perfectly. This film has not aged a bit, in
fact it is way ahead of more modern sci-fi's (with the help of giger)
but not only the brilliant design and work of that fantastic artist but
also the visuals (screens, computers, navigation) just seem to be so
right, even now in 2004. Then there is the tension and horror to
come--I could go on forever, one sentence to sum up-<br /><br />DO NOT MISS THIS INCREDIBLE FILM.
