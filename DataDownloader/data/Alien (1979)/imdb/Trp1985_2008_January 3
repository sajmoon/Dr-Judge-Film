It&#39;s amazing how Ridley Scott&#39;s &#39;Alien&#39; (1979) still manages to pack a
punch after all these decades. None of the sequels, even Cameron&#39;s
great &#39;Aliens&#39; (1986) hasn&#39;t got the constant suspense this movie
delivers. I mean, the Alien (Giger&#39;s ingenious design) isn&#39;t even shown
in full detail or neither is it present before the screen more than
seconds at a time. But it&#39;s sinister presence and the claustrophobia
felt by the crew members of the doomed &#39;Nostromo&#39; is perfectly rendered
by Ridley Scott&#151;in another person&#39;s hand this would&#39;ve easily fallen
into the ilk of &#39;Friday The 13th&#39; or &#39;Nightmare On Elm Street&#39; type
slasher flicks. What was to be a &#39;b&#39; movie was elevated to a new
standard both by Scott&#39;s impeccable direction and H.R.Giger&#39;s morbidly
creative &#39;alien&#39; design. It can easily be compared to Friedkin&#39;s &#39;The
Exorcist&#39; (1971), in it&#39;s build up towards a shattering climax and
pace. Directors&#151;at least the good ones&#151;knew the tension that can be
derived from atmospheric effects can be an added bonus to the film, and
not to rely on creature effects and gore alone. I have seen Alien a
couple of times, when I saw it in my childhood it scared me shitless.
But as I matured, I&#39;ve come to admire the film&#39;s intricate set-design,
the claustrophobia and the helplessness in space, and of course the
sinister alien creation that would be iconic in film lore. All in all,
this is fine piece of film-making done by one of the most influential
director&#39;s of our time.
