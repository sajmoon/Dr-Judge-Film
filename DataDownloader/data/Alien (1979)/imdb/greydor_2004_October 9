This has to be the most suspenseful movie I have ever seen. I have seen
it advertised or commented on as horror. This is not a horror genre
movie. It is sci-fi with an equal amount of suspense. I don't normally
watch movies more than once but this one I make an exception for. No
matter how many times I have seen it, it still is good. Sigourney
Weaver, always a favourite of mine, is at her best and Ian Holmes is
hardly recognizable in one of his best performances. Look for Geiger's
alien drawings to see the inspirational art work for this movie. The
special effects are subtle at times and that's what makes the suspense.
I've seen all 4 in the series and this is undoubtably the best one.
This is an absolute must see.
