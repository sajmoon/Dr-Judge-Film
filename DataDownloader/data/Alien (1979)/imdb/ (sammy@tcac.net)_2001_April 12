2001_April 12 

I remember going to the theater to see this movie with a date while I was
in
high school.  After the movie, my right arm had distinct fingernail
impressions caused by my date's reactions to the unbelievable sights and
sounds of the movie.  For 45 minutes, nothing happens.  I mean -
absolutely
nothing.  Then, out of the blue - POW! You are hooked, but you don't
quite
know by what, and it will take another 10 minutes to find out.  And once
you
do, the queasiness begins.  But again, Ridley Scott is not about to let
you
off that easily.  Time builds to allow your queasiness to settle - until
(when else?) it is time to eat.  What follows is the most unexpected and
incredible appearance by another creature in moviedom.  Your emotion
turns
from shock to suspense, and then to terror, and finally frustration.  But
just when you want to scream . . . you realize that &quot;in space, no can
hear
you scream&quot;.  :)  Four out of Four Stars.
