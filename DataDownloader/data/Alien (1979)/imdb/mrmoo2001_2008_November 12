&#39;Alien&#39; is a suspenseful film that takes place on a space freighter
called the Nostrama. It basically revolves around the crew trying to
avoid being eaten by a stealthy, ninja-esquire alien.<br /><br />Which makes me think, if the Nostrama actually had a comprehensive
security system, &#39;Alien&#39; would have been a lot less exciting...<br /><br />CAPTAIN: Computer, scan for alien organisms.<br /><br />COMPUTER: Alien organism located on aft deck 6.<br /><br />CAPTAIN: Seal off aft deck 6 and incinerate.<br /><br />COMPUTER: Affirmative...<br /><br />(sound of wooshing flames and screaming alien etc... screaming
eventually dies down)<br /><br />COMPUTER: Incineration complete.<br /><br />CAPTAIN: Well, that&#39;s that taken care of. What&#39;s for lunch?<br /><br />But then, what would a multi trillion dollar space station need a
security system for? OK, to be fair, &#39;Alien&#39; was made in the days when
people thought that computers went &quot;beep boop&quot; and made typewriter
sounds as text appeared on the screen one letter at a time.<br /><br />What still doesn&#39;t make sense is the fact that the Nostrama seems to be
lit with strobe lighting. Or the fact that the astronauts are allowed
to smoke. Or that there&#39;s rain inside a space ship. Or why they&#39;d be
armed with flamethrowers on a space vessel (being, as they are, in
space, where oxygen is in very limited supply). Or anything, really.<br /><br />However, &#39;Alien&#39; isn&#39;t about the realistic depiction of space travel
(which truly would be boring). It&#39;s a knife movie in space... only
instead of a psycho killer we have a killer alien, and instead of a
knife he has teeth and claws and more teeth.<br /><br />Which means that far from being realistic, &#39;Alien&#39; is all about setting
the mood, generating atmosphere and building tension. And &#39;Alien&#39; does
it well.<br /><br />The characters are believable. This is essential. If we can believe
that the characters live, we can believe that they die. We can also
believe that they&#39;re scared.<br /><br />The alien, still yet to be cheapened by future sequels, is
nigh-invincible and mysterious, and a ubiquitous threat to boot.<br /><br />There are lots of surprises. Unless you are unlucky enough to have a
friend or sibling tell you all about &#39;Alien&#39; before you watch it, you
will be shocked, or at least surprised by what you see.<br /><br />In summary, &#39;Alien&#39; holds up really well even after all these years,
and is still worth seeing as a film in its own right.
