Just saw that Ridley Scott will soon be bringing out a film
(Prometheus)that has roots in his masterpiece &#x22;Alien.&#x22; It prompted me
to go back to user reviews of this epic film, and in one of them, from
2005, a reviewer identified as Patuguitos simply and rightfully
acclaimed &#x22;Alien&#x22; as the perfect film. Bravo--it is true. This film was
victimized by bias against its science fiction genre, garnering awards
only in the areas of special effects, set direction, etc. Yes, it
features a fearsome creature (brilliantly shown in increasingly
frightful glimpses):apparently Oscar voters felt this disqualified the
film as a serious piece of cinema. Absurd--&#x22;Alien&#x22; deserved
nominations, if not wins, as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress,
Editing, Set Design, Special Effects, Score, and perhaps other
categories. I have been a discriminating film-goer for almost 60 years.
To this day, &#x22;Alien&#x22; stays with me as one of the most thrilling,
satisfying experiences in a theater I&#x27;ve ever had. 32 years later, it
has lost none of its impact. Yes--the perfect film!
