The movie is quite good if you know it's from 1979.At this time they
couldn't work with great effects like in the new Alien-films.So with no
fantastic effects trying to create a Sci-Fi film where effects are from
big
importance is difficult.But Scott succeeded, it's one of these movies you
know from the first minute on that it's something special.And that's quite
right, because through that film Scott created a new genre or at least
gave
now life to Sci-Fi.
Very enjoyable is to buy the Alien-films all together and watch them a
weekend through.So you get the story at one piece and don't have to remind
yourself everytime new.Also you can see how Sigourney Weaver changes in
every film.This shall NOT be promotion, but I did so and was
surprised.
