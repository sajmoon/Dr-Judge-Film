Next to the Star Wars trilogy, Alien is the 2nd best sci-fi movie ever and
one of the best horrors.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the story, Sigourney Weaver and her space crew
investigate some strange creatures. Then they disturb one of the eggs they
find. Trouble starts. Sound scary? It is.<br /><br />It's too bad that Sigourney Weaver never won an Oscar for her role as
Lieutenant  Ellen Ripley (in this one she's just ripley, in Aliens she's a
lieutenant). The sound and special effects are amazing, and it's very scary.
Trust me--you won't be bored. Grade: A
