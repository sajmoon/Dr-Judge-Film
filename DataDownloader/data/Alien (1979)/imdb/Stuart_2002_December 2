This is still the best of the 4 films in the alien series. Ok some things
look a little dated in some parts, but its still brilliant, after all name
another film with such an original, famous scene like the chest burster
coming out of John Hurt.<br /><br />Watch this film its brilliant and it set the standard for Sci-fi films to
this day (after all it has a 2nd claim of being one of very few films to
have a sequel thats on par with the original)
