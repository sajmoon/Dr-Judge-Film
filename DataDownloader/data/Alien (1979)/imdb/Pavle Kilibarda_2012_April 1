2012_April 1 
This film matches my taste in art on every level. It is slow, elegant
and perverse in a very intellectual way, and is also a movie which
addresses the intelligent viewer: one who immerses himself into the
detail of the design and script and, of course, who is expected to use
his imagination throughout the viewing.<br /><br />I have shown this film to several of my friends, who were not quite as
impressed by it as I was, indeed they yawned and called it boring
several times during the very long &#x22;prologue&#x22;, so to speak. I was
disappointed, but not surprised. Contemporary sci-fi is reduced to a
cheap but dynamic story and CGI (of course, there has been a pair of
brilliant films in the past ten years, but shoddy is the norm in my
opinion). If you are looking for a fast-paced piece with lots of
action, this may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />On my part, I believe that this film comes as close to perfection as
possible: the only &#x22;flaws&#x22; I notice and that occasionally bother me are
the effects in some parts, such as the android head and drops of water
in the end shot. The volume of the score sometimes seems to be too low
for my taste and I believe all of Goldsmith&#x27;s masterwork should have
been used as per his idea. Finally, there is a pair of shots in which I
believe a little too much of the Alien has been shown, and I don&#x27;t
really like the way the part of the suit beneath the torso was made. Of
course, all of these things are trivial in the big picture, and you
probably wouldn&#x27;t notice them on the first viewing.<br /><br />And why do I think this is the finest work of art in movie history? I
have already said that it engages the viewer in a very discrete
fashion. The scene on the alien planet alone should leave you puzzled,
but no sooner do we start asking ourselves the first row of questions,
the next one has emerged, and so on. For the first-time viewer, the
most enthralling question is certainly what the creature looks like and
what might we see in the next shot, which for me was an original
experience.<br /><br />The design is probably the finest point of the film. Ron Cobb designed
the human element of the film, whereas the great master Giger outdid
himself with the alien vessel and creatures. The environment of the
alien vessel is the most foreign looking and curious I have ever seen
in a movie, and that is not taking into account the many refined sexual
themes. The dichotomy of human (functional, wet, sometimes
sterile-looking) and alien (dark, massive, uneconomically large and
erotic) is why I enjoy watching this work over and over again.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already mentioned the acting, so I will only
mention Ian Holm&#x27;s performance, which I find to be the finest of the
cast. There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, and very
laconic at that. This actually allows the atmosphere, score and
body-language to come into the foreground - especially in the third
act, when the flashing lights, sirens and Mother&#x27;s voice seem to give
an unusually loud and urban tone. The fact that we are aware, as the
audience, of this illusion (which somehow comforts the viewer after
having witnessed the previous events, and by this time likely being
thoroughly horrified) underlines even more aggressively, despite the
lights and sounds, the solitude aboard a massive, empty, eerie star
freighter.<br /><br />Of course, the ending is shockingly sublime, with the extract from
Howard Hanson&#x27;s Romantic Symphony providing a wonderful respite from
the cathartic ordeal (this is, in fact, the only part of Mr. Scott&#x27;s
tampering with the score that I approve of), and you will probably
continue watching till the credits end, dwelling on the most powerful
theme of the movie: the vastness, hostility and unthinkable age of the
Universe.
