I have seen a dozen alien movies including Alien vs. Predator. I even
knew what the alien looks like so I wasn&#x27;t having high expectations
from this movie. But, It got me, boy! From beginning till the end, the
movie was astounding. Unlike other movies which are made today (which
show a lot of gore and are very action packed) Alien is the only alien
movie that gives a creepy feeling of &#x22;We are not alone&#x22;. Unlike today&#x27;s
movies, they spent the first few minutes only to show us the entire the
art-direction of the ship and how it works. Surprisingly enough, all
the important scenes take place in these areas. Ridley Scott very
cleverly creates the tension, slowly and slowly and a bit fast and a
bit more fast and then a bang in the end! I still wonder how the hell
they must have created those creatures and that too with extremely
higher detail. The story to has a hard solid structures with pretty
shocking twists. This movie is not like those non-sense action horror
movies where you just watch people dying. Alien is way ahead of even
today&#x27;s film-making. It&#x27;s a true benchmark like 2001 A space Odyssey.
It&#x27;s a highly recommended masterpiece. I hope this one releases again
in 3D!
