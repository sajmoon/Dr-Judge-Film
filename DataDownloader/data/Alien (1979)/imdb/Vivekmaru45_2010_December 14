The rating I have given is purely because of the plot, excellent
background score and the superb special effects.<br /><br />That being said, let us move on.<br /><br />The plot I have already explained in the title of the review. It is a
basic encounter a new hostile-to-human species plot. That the species
needs a human host to develop itself into a completely different form
is simply genius. <br /><br />Some the actors in the film look out of place, and I wonder why they
had been cast. Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean, Stanton Veronica Cartwright
all are miserable choices. <br /><br />Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm are the real
stars of the film. <br /><br />Plot The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip from
Thedus to Earth, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral
ore and carrying its seven-member crew in stasis. Upon receiving a
transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship&#x27;s
computer awakens the crew.[12] Acting on orders from their corporate
employers, the crew detaches the Nostromo from the refinery and lands
on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas
(Tom Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt), and Navigator
Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) set out to investigate the signal&#x27;s
source while Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer
Ash (Ian Holm), and Engineers Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker
(Yaphet Kotto) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.<br /><br />Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a
derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large
alien creature whose ribs appear to have been exploded outward from the
inside. Meanwhile, the Nostromo&#x27;s computer partially deciphers the
signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of
warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of
which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and
Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, where Ash
allows them inside against Ripley&#x27;s orders to follow the ship&#x27;s
quarantine protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature
from Kane&#x27;s face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive
acid. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead.
With the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth.<br /><br />Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering
stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts
from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking
conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the
creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and
flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew&#x27;s cat into a large room where the
now-fully-grown Alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the
ship&#x27;s air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the
Alien into an airlock where it can be expelled into space, but it
ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in
the ship&#x27;s shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the
shuttle will not support four people.<br /><br />Accessing the ship&#x27;s computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been
ordered to return the Alien to the Nostromo&#x27;s corporate employers even
at the expense of the crew. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and
decapitates him with a blow from a fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to
be an android. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the
other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members
plan to arm the Nostromo&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism and escape in the
shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering
the necessary supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and
heads for the shuttle with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her
way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then
returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as
the Nostromo explodes.<br /><br />As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is
aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch,
causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the open
doorway. She shoots it with a grappling gun which propels it out, but
the gun is caught in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the
shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley
activates them and blasts the Alien into space. Ripley puts herself and
the cat into stasis for the return trip to Earth.<br /><br />In writing the script screenwriter Dan O&#x27;Bannon drew inspiration from
the following films: The Thing from Another World (1951), Forbidden
Planet (1956), and Planet of the Vampires (1965).<br /><br />H.R Giger was recruited to work on all aspects of the Alien and its
environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict
spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult.<br /><br />Imitations: Contamination (1980), Inseminoid (1981) and Xtro (1982).<br /><br />Conclusion: buy the &#x22;Directors cut&#x22; showing five minutes extra footage.
