This movie beats all other Sci-fi horrors! Ridley Scott was the one who
brought the remarkable picture to our eyes, and yet he's an Englishman
and thats why I'm proud! <br /><br />&quot;I admire its purity. A survivor...unclouded by conscience, remorse, or
delusions of morality&quot;<br /><br />Seven crew members are on there way home, until they're awakened from
hypersleep by &quot;Mother&quot;, the ship's computer system, who has detected a
beacon from another planet, known as the LV-426. Their next unexpected
mission is to land on the LV-426 and search to see if there is any life
form, orders from &quot;The Company&quot;. Three of the members carry out a
search on the planet to see if they can find anything worth bringing
back. It's only when they realise that Kane, one of the crew members
has been molested. A &quot;Facehugger&quot; attached to his head while
unconscious, feeding him oxygen... what is it doing? After Kane has had
the pleasure of giving birth to the little sh!t, the crew start to
realise what they've brought onto the ship as it starts to pick one
member off at a time.<br /><br />A fantastic movie by a fantastic director!
