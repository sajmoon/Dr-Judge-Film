After seeing James Cameron's Aliens, I decided to check out Alien. So I
rented the DVD from my local Blockbuster. I must say that I was not
disappointed. Even though the film is 21 years old, it is still as great and
fresh as it was back in 1979. Watching the DVD, it makes it look so fresh
that it could have only been released last week! Nearly everyone knows what
this is about so I won't say anything. What I will say is that it is a well
made, suspense filled and occasionly gory film. The effects are great (
especially the alien ) and are not dated in any way. The small cast are
excellent and the set design is wonderful. If you get the DVD version, there
are about a dozen scenes not included in the original such as a full view of
the Alien in one attack shot and a much talked about scene which would have
made the ending to James Cameron's Aliens impossible.Overall, an excellent
example of Science Fiction that is well worth seeing.
