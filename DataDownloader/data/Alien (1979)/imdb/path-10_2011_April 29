Conceived by Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett and directed by Ridley
Scott, Alien (1979) is a timeless classic. The setting is a vast and
isolated space where the storyline follows a small crew of a transport
ship which is woken up by unknown signal. After they investigate it
they come in contact with one of the most iconic creatures in the film
history.<br /><br />I particularly like the art design in this film. The sets are
intriguing and bizarre which makes them very beautiful in a way. The
highlight is indeed the design of the creature itself in all its forms.
It is original, bizarre and extremely detailed. The amount of realism
and detail applied to it is just amazing. The good example of this is
the scene where it bursts out of the Kane&#x27;s chest. That&#x27;s one of the
most shocking and at the same time one of the best scenes I have ever
seen. Obviously the most amazing is the fully grown Alien. Taller than
the human, large tail, strange body, smooth head, detailed skull under
it, mouth inside a mouth and a strange fluid dripping from it is just
something we haven&#x27;t seen before. One could really agree with Ash and
his opinion.<br /><br />I also like the concept of its life cycle. It goes from a strange egg
to a parasite to a brutal little thing and finally transforms into a
perfect dominant specie. Another great component of the film is the
music score. It is just as beautiful and intriguing as everything else.<br /><br />In my opinion horror dimension of the film is only second to all this.<br /><br />10/10
