Of all the Scifi&#39;s I own this is one of my favorites. I remember when
this trailer came out (* oddly I was a bit young I admit *) However I
credit this movie with something unique . The Trailer was brilliant ,
but showed you nothing . All I remember seeing was the word Alien on a
green egg shape . No Poiler there ...<br /><br />This movie is one of those that sucks you into the picture immediately
and refuses to let you go. Ridley has created what is arguably the
strongest female character in a sci-fi film. At the same time not
giving into the clich&eacute; of bombshell I think this film and the later
released Aliens are Sigorney Weaver&#39;s best performances.
