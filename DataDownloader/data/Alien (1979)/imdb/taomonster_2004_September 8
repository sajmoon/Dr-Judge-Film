This is the original spacehorrormovie of all times. All the others are
no way near as good or well made. This brilliant movie has it all....If
you haven't seen this one...it's about time. Only one movie does it
credit without being a ripoff( not counting Aliens ) and thats Pitch
black starring the( in this movie) awesome Vin Diesel. Its not nearly
as cool or horrific but worth a look. I personally hated Alien 3 which
is the same movie as Alien without the suspense or excitement about
this powerful new monster. Aliens is a different movie all together.
This actionpacked-thriller rule action-thrillers. But I don't think you
can compare Alien with Aliens. Alien rule above all in space!! See it
in the dark.
