I was a teen-ager when I first saw this picture back in theaters in 1979.
When I got out, my legs were shaking. That hadn't happened to me since I had
seen a re-issue of &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) in a drive-in. &quot;Alien&quot; was inspired by a
1958 B &amp; W mini-classic &quot;It! the Terror From Beyond Space!&quot; The film's
terror follows a scene where an astronaut (John Hurt) is infected with an
alien organism after a crew of 7 touch down on a planet to investigate a
distress signal. What follows will take your breath away, (and leave your
eyes semi-closed) with shocking, supremely suspenseful set-pieces, marvelous
Ridley Scott direction, authentic-appearing sets, eerie music, an
ever-evolving, terrifying Alien costume and superb ensemble playing by the
rest of the cast: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Ian
Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto.  Followed by three decreasingly
effective sequels (so far).
