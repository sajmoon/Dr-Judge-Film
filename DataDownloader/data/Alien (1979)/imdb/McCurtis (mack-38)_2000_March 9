2000_March 9 

I've seen many horror films, but something about Alien by a brief
advertisment that just show &quot;An Egg and words In Space No one can hear you
Scream&quot;, that was it, but it was enough to hook me.  When I first saw the
movie at a wide screen theater, the tension was  so great, I actually sat
on
the end of the seat<br /><br />Missed the part of the Alien popped out the man's chest, for some reason I
and many fellow men, just had to take a break and walk out in the lobby to
relieve the tension. I wasn't prepared for the main character to be
killed,
for not only did I jump completely out my seat, it was unheard of for
known
actor to get killed. My only disappointment after reading the book, &quot;why
did'nt they try more to kill the thing&quot;, well all was brought out in the
book, and Ripley Scott, gave his reason for deleting those scenes.  I do
like Aliens better, but nothing could explain the initial fear of the
first
one.  I highly recommend seeing this film.
