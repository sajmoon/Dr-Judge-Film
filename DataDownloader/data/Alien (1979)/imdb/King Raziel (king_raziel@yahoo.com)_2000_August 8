2000_August 8 

I remember seeing this film when I was very young.  I was around six years
old and my mean babysitter brought it over on video to watch.  I had never
seen anything like it before.  It was my first &quot;R&quot;-rated movie!  I was truly
terrified but I kept wanting to see the Alien and what it would do.  I never
cried during the film...well, not until I went to bed.  The graphic, gory
death scenes and horriffic screams and sounds in this film make it one of
the most frightening films in motion picture history.  Today I absolutely
love this film, simply because it still scares me!  Sigourney Weaver was
brilliant.  This is still her best role in my book.  Many believe James
Cameron's sequel is the best film of the series.  To me, it's the second
best.  Alien rules!  Ridley Scott's original film is more of a &quot;horror&quot; film
while Cameron's(though extremely brilliant) is more of a action flic.  Alien
will be a horror flic that will never be forgotten.
