A rebuke to Star Wars. This is horror the way Darth Vasder should have
been in the hands of a real film maker instead of Lucas&#39;s indulgent
fantasy about fluffy monsters. Those who don&#39;t know what its about the
synopsis is an abandoned derelict space craft harbors eggs which have a
life cycle similar to insects and John Hurt gets his most famous role.
Dark tortured tense this also precedes Das Boot surprisingly with its
mobile camera, the first use of steady cam, and tense claustrophobic
darkly lit sets. Has received a minor backlash because it is so good
and critics hate admitting this genre can produce classics. Watchit
again and again and never be disappointed
