I don&#39;t know that many Sci-Fi pictures that are more like a horror
movie. This movie was absolutely scary, some very memorable scenes, two
great actresses, one realistic alien, great effects for its time,
awesome storyline. In parts of the scene, when the character faces one
problem, they get into a bigger problem, then again, etc. This is
probably the best Sci-Fi movie of all time (behind Star Wars). I would
definitely recommend this movie for any sci-fi, horror, or even movie
fan. You would be absolutely blown away by this movie, so blown away
you&#39;ll think a giant vacuum is trying to suck you out of your house.
ENJOY IT!
