There&#39;s really not much to say about &quot;Alien&quot; that hasn&#39;t already been
said. It&#39;s one of my favorite films of all time and I&#39;d still argue
that&#39;s it&#39;s the best thing Ridley Scott has ever done (and that&#39;s
saying a lot). So instead of rehashing the same old reviews, I thought
I&#39;d share with y&#39;all my first experience with Alien...<br /><br />Back in the summer of 1981, my parents decided to take my brother and I
to a drive-in. Yes, an actual drive-in. The feature presentation was
this swanky new film everyone had been buzzing about, some newfangled
adventure movie y&#39;all know as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot; The movie
started around eight, my Dad provided us with tons of snacks and my
brother and I first got to see Indiana Jones from the comfort of my
parents&#39; wagon, snuggled in our sleeping bags in the back seat.<br /><br />When the film was over, my brother and I were supposed to go to sleep
while my parents watched the second half of the double feature, one of
their favorite films, &quot;Alien.&quot; <br /><br />I was seven years old.<br /><br />Needless to say, I didn&#39;t go to sleep that night...<br /><br />Needless to say, I didn&#39;t sleep without a light on for a month...<br /><br />Needless to say, &quot;Alien&quot; became one of my favorite films as well and
that night, as frightening as it was for a seven year old, became one
of my favorite childhood memories as a thirty-two year old man.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film, savor it. Find a dark, dank evening,
turn off all the lights, and soak in every moment.<br /><br />Just make sure the kids are really asleep...
