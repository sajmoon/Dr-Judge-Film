Ridley Scott's frenetic camera work combined with the nightmarish, yet
genius biomechanoid visions of H. R. Giger brought us the most hideous,
disgusting creatures that ever might be out there in deep space.   The theme
of the movie is often imitated, but never executed as well -- even in its
own sequels.<br /><br />With lurking not uncommon to the mythical realms of Howard Phillips
Lovecraft, the creature is out there in the shadows, camouflaged by the
technical scenery.  Sleek and slowly it creeps, yet jumps quick to the
attack, jaws slashing, screaming.  <br /><br />More than scary, this film taps into the fears of the unknown and leaves us
there unguarded.
