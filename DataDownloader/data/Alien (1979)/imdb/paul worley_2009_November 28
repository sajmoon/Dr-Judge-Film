When I was a boy (Born in 88) I ask my father what was the scariest
movie he has ever seen. He told me it had to be Alien. He told me that
it the most original sci-fi thriller up to date. And I believe him. I
knew about the creature, how it worked, how it looked, the ending of
the movie, how many survived, yaddie yadda, but when I saw the movie I
haven&#x27;t been put in so much suspense until I saw the Blair Witch
Project. The Xenomorph is a beautiful snake like specimen.<br /><br />Ridley Scott gave a Gothic feel to the movie and the music made you
feel as if you were there. It&#x27;s form of suspense wasn&#x27;t like most
horror movies where you could say, &#x22;Oh I would just do this, or that,
because you know there are so many ways out of those situations.&#x22;
You&#x27;re set dead in space on a ship that is basically a labyrinth with a
monster who is a mystery until the very end. Even during the peaceful
scenes in the seemingly safe rooms your still at the edge of your seat,
just waiting for it to come.<br /><br />There has never ever, ever, been a science fiction character of any
species that beats this one.<br /><br />This has got to be the best movie of all time.
