1999_July 29 

It becomes more than a little depressing after a while, when people
discuss
this film and say: &quot;It's OK, but Aliens is way better!&quot; The reason,
apparently, is that in Alien, &quot;nothing happens,&quot; whereas Aliens is
&quot;Kick-ass!&quot; Quite. The sad thing is, I know how they feel, since I used to
agree with them. James Cameron's sequel has far more action in it - ie,
weapons are actually used effectively against the aliens - and is a more
traditional crowd-pleaser. Its main fan-base consists of undemanding
teenagers, (who no doubt fast-forward through the first hour of the film,
since nothing happens in it) who enjoy quoting amongst their friends such
classic lines as: &quot;Let's rock!&quot;, &quot;Get away from her, you bitch!&quot; and &quot;F**k
you!&quot; I have nothing against this viewpoint as such, and they're entitled
to
their opinions, but it would be nice if they could justify them with
something more than they do. It can hardly be insignificant that most of
this Alien's detractors find it difficult to string a grammatically
correct
sentence together to oppose it; sorry if that sounds unpleasant, but I
think
it's unfair that such a brilliant and important film should be given such
a
raw deal so much of the time. I suppose, as mindless Hollywood action
films
go, Aliens isn't so bad, and the series as a whole is far superior to many
others - but the first is the only one I could ever call a good film. It
is
far more intelligent, frightening, visually impressive, inventive, and far
better acted, directed and scored than any of its sequels or imitators. As
for James Cameron...I won't even start on why I hate him.
