Alien is truly a work of art. Ridley Scott hand carved this monster in
space epic from almost nothing, a fairly limp script and a budget that
required some imagination. Scott delivered on every front and made this
classic that I believe will live on well after Hollywood does a shoddy
remake of it.<br /><br />The manages suspense like no other, its music is so haunting and mellow
that it murmurs beneath the surface until its ready to pounce. The pace
is uncomfortable speed, in its first half very little happens and
though it doesn&#x27;t drag it pulls you along giving you just enough
interest to keep you attached, but keeping the audience at an arms
length to make u feel like you are a peeping tom, all the more creepy.
The famous chest bursting sequence is where the film really kicks off
and literally drives into a speed at which is relentless and
horrifying.<br /><br />The scenery in the film is just stunning. From Gigers towering and
disturbing Alien set pieces to claustrophobic nostromo. Every inch of
the film is thought through superbly, the scenery and the lighting and
the music compliment every aspect as the film goes on. Sigourney Weaver
is nothing short of amazing, her first major role was one that she
would be remembered for forever. Ripley is the quintessential female
action hero, a tough as nails captain that displays a ferocious side,
but at the same time has a warmth and nurturing aspect that makes her
oh so likable.<br /><br />Alien&#x27;s four sequels (I&#x27;m excluding Alien Vs Predator)all attempt a new
take on the original film. The sequel Aliens captures something new,
but retains the same feel of the original. Some argue it as better than
Alien, but I disagree, Alien is unbelievably refined and well done,
whereas Aliens offers a staggering action caper with a great weighted
drama as well. Alien 3 is the major miss step in the franchise, but it
still has some merit. And Alien: Resurrection tries something new and
half achieves its goal, but I can&#x27;t help thinking they could have gone
further with it.<br /><br />Alien is incredible, a classic film that all should see. And though not
to everyones taste it is undeniable that this film has stood the test
of time because its so damn good.
