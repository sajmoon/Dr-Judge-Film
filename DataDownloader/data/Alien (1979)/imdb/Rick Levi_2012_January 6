I just watched this movie because of the glowing reviews on IMDb, its
pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes (96%), and because I really liked
another Ridley Scott movie, Blade Runner. I had watched Gladiator,
Thelma and Louise, and Kingdom of Heaven but I didn&#x27;t really like them.
I think Blade Runner is the only movie I&#x27;ve seen that deserves a
perfect 100/100.<br /><br />Alien is a good movie. A very good movie. It&#x27;s just not as good as
Blade Runner. The movie is often compared with Star Wars, which isn&#x27;t
unreasonable because both movies are set in space. However, Alien
places more emphasis on the &#x22;science&#x22; part of science-fiction. So, is
the movie better than Star Wars? I think it is. But is it more
enjoyable?. No, it&#x27;s not.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t really like horror movies. I used to be pretty easily scared.
I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that the scariest movie I saw as a kid was
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It didn&#x27;t matter that there were
dwarfs for comic relief, the queen was pretty scary. I was willing to
take a chance with Alien, though, because it was a science-fiction
movie as well as a horror movie. But Alien isn&#x27;t scary.<br /><br />I think the reason Alien isn&#x27;t scary is because it&#x27;s somewhat a part of
the popular culture. Not so much as Star Wars, of course, but it is.
Everyone already knows what&#x27;s supposed to happen to Kane and what the
Alien is supposed to look like.<br /><br />And I thought the lack of screen time for the title character was a bit
disappointing. You never see the entire thing in full light except for
this one part at the very end. And then you realize why it had to have
such limited screen time; the creature is a costume. I thought it was
just a puppet but, no, there was an actor in that thing, no doubt about
it. I looked it up on Wikipedia to make sure and it&#x27;s true, the thing
was a costume not a puppet. <br /><br />So Alien isn&#x27;t very scary. If you&#x27;re looking for a good horror movie, I
think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. If you&#x27;re looking for a good science-
fiction movie, well, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;d
probably say it&#x27;s the fifth most enjoyable to watch after (in this
order, with the first being the best) Blade Runner, Jurassic Park, Star
Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It&#x27;s
definitely more enjoyable than 2001: A Space Odyssey. You can see the
impact 2001 had on it but Alien is better because it has an actual
plot, you can care for the human characters (including one that is
almost like HAL), and it is also pretty complex and makes you wonder
what just might be out there in space.
