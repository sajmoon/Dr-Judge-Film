This is a masterpiece of film in the horror/sci-fi genre. Large
budget-scale
production. Real artwork production design. Very well-written script.
Seven
professional actors. Strong and scary effects. Ridley Scott&acute;s masterminded
direction and a just awesome monster which shows to be just as intelligent
as destructive. All this makes &quot;Alien&quot; to something above the usual.
Sigourney Weaver couldn&acute;t have made a more perfect film debute. That&acute;s why
I
cosider &quot;Alien&quot; to be the best sci-fi-movie ever done.
