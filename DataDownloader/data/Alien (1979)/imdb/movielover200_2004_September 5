Alien is still creepy and thrilling, whether in Director's Cut or the
regular edition. The story is about a spaceship crew on a ship called
the Nostromo, who land on a strange planet, where a strange alien egg
hatches, and out bursts a hand-like creature onto one man's face. The
creature injects fluids into the man, and the crew cannot remove the
thing. Soon, it dies, and he is as normal as ever. One day when they
are eating, suddenly he starts having strange stomach contraptions, and
soon, a chubby worm-like alien creature bursts out of his stomach. The
thing scurries away. Soon, the crew starts disappearing, and one crew
member, Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, suspects that the alien has
grown giant, and is slaughtering everyone. And there is no way to
escape, since they are in space, days away from Earth. In space, no one
can hear you scream. Alien is one of the best sci-fi films ever, and
even spawned three sequels so far.<br /><br />Grade: 8/10<br /><br />MPAA Rating: R<br /><br />My Rating: Ages 14 and up (gore, language)
