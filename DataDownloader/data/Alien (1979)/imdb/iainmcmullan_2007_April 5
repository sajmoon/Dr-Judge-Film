Wow were do I start , this film is truly amazing . When this film was
released back in 79 ,YES THAT&#39;S 79 , it must have been like an alien
itself landed . There is nothing in this jaunra before or after this
film that can beat this film , not even Cameron&#39;s fine sequel .<br /><br />This film might be getting on to nearly 30 years old but it still looks
great . From the first moment in this film where the computer logs on a
starts up the movie grips you and does&#39;nt let go . Ridly Scott&#39;s vision
of a deep space mining ship is truly amazing and still looks plausible
today .<br /><br />Scott&#39;s masterfull us of lighting and narrow corridors created a
situation so intense and chilling that when I first saw this film 20
year&#39;s ago it was the best movie experience I think I ever had . You
really get a feel for the characters in their dire situation that
director&#39;s today seem to overlook in favour of gore and special
effect&#39;s . You really get a feel of how helpless man is if he were to
come up against such a creature .<br /><br />And boy what a creature . I don&#39;t think the alien has been surpassed in
movie history by a more realistic or terrifying creature . Giger broke
the mold when he dreamt this one up . The alien in this movie has a
more humanoid look about it than any of the sequels which I think
give&#39;s it a more psychologically menacing aspect to it . It&#39;s Scott&#39;s
sparing use of the creature due to him not having the budget or huge
animatronics team behind him Cameron did that works so well leaving the
imagination of the cinema goer to run wild . <br /><br />The film builds gradually to a crescendo of and ending with great
twist&#39;s along the way . The casting for the film was perfect and great
array of talent on show scott&#39;s went for unknowns with ability rather
than the established star root . This worked well as it reinforced the
impression ordinary people in an extraordinary situation it probably
also cut down on cost .<br /><br />This lead&#39;s us to be introduced to the very talented Sigourny Weaver
who play&#39;s the Riply character to perfection and made her an icon in
movie history . <br /><br />In the age of CGI and high wire&#39;s some younger viewers may find it all
a little dated but for me when the alien became computerised it lost
it&#39;s magic and realism and you just did&#39;nt find it scary anymore . <br /><br />So if you have&#39;nt seen it yet your missing a real treat .
