This classic Sci-Fi/Horror/Thriller is a relentless suspense film is
about a group of Space Explorers (Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt,
Veronica Crtwright, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton and John
Hurt) are in a routine mission that accidentally bring aboard an
extremely dangerous and adaptable life form.<br /><br />Directed by Ridley Scott (Black Hawn Down, Blade Runner, Legend) made
an excellent Sci-Fi/Horror/Thriller. This was one of the most original
and best films of 1979. The cast are extremely good (Especially Weaver
in her first lead role). The film has an unforgettable scene with John
Hurt in the dinner table is a knockout. It was great seeing the fold
print of Alien, which i had the chance to see it in a special theater
with fans from the first film, it was great. Although i didn&#39;t have a
chance to see the Director&#39;s Cut, when it was re-release in 2003.<br /><br />The original 1999 DVD has an strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1)
transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound
and the original-Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. The DVD has an
not-bad running commentary track by the director. The DVD also has
Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and more. The film won an Oscar fro Best
Visual Effects. The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction-Set
Decoration. This DVD is digitally remastered in THX Picture Quality and
Sound.<br /><br />The new two disc set of Alien has the Original Theatrical Cut and the
Director&#39;s Cut. DVD has an brand new commentary track by the filmmakers
and cast members. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1)
transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound
and an new DTS Audio. For both versions of the film on the same disc.
The second disc has deleted scenes, new featurettes with the cast &amp;
crew and more. Those who still have their 1999 DVD Edition, you are
better off keeping it for the solo commentary track by the director and
two alternative isolated music tracks. This is a one of a kind film,
don&#39;t miss it. Panavision. (**** &frac12;/*****).
