(I am Spanish, so more alien than that is impossible) Directed by
Ridley Scott, this still one of his five best movies, and my favourite
movie of him and of my lifetime. Despite the plot (space ship, derelict
spaceship, bad-ass alien) the power of this movie is in the visual side
and in the both repulsive and frightening use of the sexual elements to
encrypt and describe the alien world. What can be more horrible to
terminate your life than use the very first thing that started it?
That's right! That alien is the freudian attack to everybody's fear,
the human sex in rampaging state.<br /><br />Feel the fear in every nerve of your skin, this movie will scare you
even 20 times after see it.
