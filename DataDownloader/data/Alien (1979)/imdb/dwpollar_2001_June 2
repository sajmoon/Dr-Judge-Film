1st watched 6/2/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Ridley Scott):
Well-constructed scary movie where the murderer just happens to be an
alien.
Tremendously paced &amp; photographed by director Ridley Scott, keeping you
on
the edge of the seat till the very end.  Sigourney Weaver is not
necessarily
the star in this movie, she just happens to be the only survivor, and then
goes on to be the star in the many sequels that follow. There are many
well
done things in this movie including the transition of the alien itself
from
the attached lifeform on John Hurt's character's face to the almost
human-like appearance that it has near the end.   The story itself is
simple
but the characters are very down to earth and believable enough that you
do
care for them unlike some cheap horror movies where the characters are so
stupid that you want them to die.  It is no doubt why the movie started a
trend of these type of pictures because of it's obvious box-office appeal
and the quality that was put into it.  It's successors of course do not
come
close to the type of all-around quality that is displayed in this
picture.
