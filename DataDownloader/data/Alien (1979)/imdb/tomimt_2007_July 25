We see a huge ship flying through space. Inside we see helmets placed
on the cockpits chairs, when the computers turn on. We see reflections
of the data from the visors of the helmets, when the automated
procedures wake up the the crew of seven.<br /><br />The opening scene has burned itself into my mind. It has been there
since I saw the film for the first time as a kid aged of six or so.
From some reason I thought that scene was a bit scary back then. Even
though I don&#39;t think the opening as scary anymore, I still do think
it&#39;s a great way to open a story.<br /><br />Ridcley Scott manages to serve a visually and stylistically stunning
movie, the best movie of the Alien franchise. From the design of
Nostromo to the derelict ship of the space jockeys, we see solid design
all around. H.R. Gigers alien design is, well from the lack of a better
word, so alien, yet so familiar, that it stays to haunt you in the back
of your mind. A hunter, whose only priority is to survive and ensure
the survival of the species.<br /><br />It&#39;s very difficult to try and pin point a weak link from the film.
There may be one or two inconstancy&#39;s in the story and a couple of
special effects may look like they were done in the late 70&#39;s, but the
thing is, that the film and the effects have taken the test of time
very well. This is a movie with deep shadows and alien sounds. This is
a story, that dives deeper inside your psyche than you even realize.
And it gets better each time you watch it.
