Two comments stand out about Alien in the review from Newsweek in 1979:
One, that Alien reminds us that not all extraterrestrials are cute, as
in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Second, that the movie is
nothing more than a scifi haunted house story. The reviewer was really
impressed by Ridley Scott&#39;s terrifying and claustrophobic telling of a
very unwelcome guest on a deep-space version of the Edmund Fitzgerald.<br /><br />Anyone who appreciates the craft of film making should too.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think anyone really anticipated that the Alien, chest-popping,
acid-dripping, chrome-toothed, eggplant-from-Hell answer to the little
guys with the big heads in CEOTTK would become so ingrained in our
national pop-culture. You can do a sock-head impression with your hand,
have it pop out of some sort of surface, do a periscope swivel while
you emit some sort of high-pitched shriek, and then have your hand
scurry off . . . and everyone gets it! At the same time, anyone who has
to sit by the fat, sweaty guy on the Southwest Airlines flight can do a
Sigourney Weaver impression, when she gets face-to-face with Eggplant
Boy.<br /><br />Alien scared the pasta sauce out of me, sitting there in the UA Cinemas
in the Spokane Valley, 28 years ago. Cripes, it was uncomfortable. What
was even weirder is that, without the theatre&#39;s intention, the climate
of the place matched the cold dampness of some of the Nostromo&#39;s
interiors. It was hot out and the A/C in the theatre was doing
double-time and a half while the critter picked off one member of the
crew after another.<br /><br />Which brings us to the ending, the infamous cat-saving scene and
Sigourney in ribcage-length-ed t-shirt and panties. Stephen King, in a
review of the best movies of 1979 in (I think) Crawdaddy Magazine, said
that hyper-feminists and male chauvinists both groaned when Weaver&#39;s
character, Ellen Ripley leaves herself wide open to attack when she
saves the Nostromo&#39;s house cat. The Feminazis snarled that Ripley
betrayed femalehood by doing something girlish, and the pigs in the
audience, while drooling over Weaver, bra-less, and with buff buttocks
clearly defined in her undies, snickered at Ripley&#39;s being just like a
woman, stopping to save a stupid cat.<br /><br />King disagreed with both of them. He pointed out that it was Ripley&#39;s
ingrained humanity that caused her to do what all the armchair
commandos were complaining about. We&#39;d respect her less if she didn&#39;t
do what a compassionate person would do.<br /><br />I liked King&#39;s thinking, here. Sigourney Weaver became a star by
portraying a woman with power who uses her intellect and strength to
stay alive on the Nostromo. If she hadn&#39;t been compassionate, she would
have been nothing more than a Terminatrix. Even the little bits of
cotton stretched over boobs and butt made her seem more human, a more
sympathetic character.<br /><br />Well, I&#39;ve thought this thing too hard. I recommend Alien for the three
things all great action movies need to entertain: Empathetic
characters, believable situations, and a great, great bad guy.<br /><br />The Buick fangs and acidic blood are gravy on the mashed potatoes!
