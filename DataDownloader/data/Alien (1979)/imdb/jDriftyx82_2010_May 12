I first saw this movie when I was like 8 years old, and I loved it. It
was one of my favorite movies, behind Star Wars (4-6), and Toy Story.
But then I watched it again for the second time with my younger cousin
and it just....Wasn&#x27;t the same. It&#x27;s still a great movie but I guess in
the last few years I&#x27;ve been spoiled by other awesome movies, and
Aliens still holds up, but not as good.<br /><br />I still highly recommend this movie, but keep an open mind.<br /><br />Originally: 4/4 Now: 3/4<br /><br />Also, don&#x27;t watch Aliens 3. Aliens is good and Aliens 4 is fine. But
Aliens 3 is just garbage
