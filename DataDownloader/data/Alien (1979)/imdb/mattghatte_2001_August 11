My i the only person who think this is a awful, awful movie. First problem
is that Ridley Scott trys to build up tension(what little of it there is) so
nothing at tall happens for 2/3 of the movie. And when the alien does
finally does appear, its so disspointing, so dark, so boring. But the main
reason why its bad is that sometimes the film is just depressing to watch,
this film is just so lifeless and dull its unreal.
