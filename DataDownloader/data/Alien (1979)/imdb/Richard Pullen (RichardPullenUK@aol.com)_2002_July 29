Star Wars for grown ups? Oh no it's completely different! This is a chilling
suspence thriller all the way!<br /><br />A bunch of astronauts on there way home to earth...they get a distress
call...they don not ignore the call, and they embark on some visitors of the
&quot;Oh my God NOOOOOOOOO! Argggghhhh!&quot; kind!<br /><br />Maybe Ridley Scotts finest 116 minutes!
