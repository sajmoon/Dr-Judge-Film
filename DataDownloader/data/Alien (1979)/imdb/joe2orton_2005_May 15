What can I say that has not already been said. We live on a violent
planet in a violent universe. That said, the director extended that
desperate aggression out into the universe. It is a lonely place, a
violent place, where even human life is cheap and a species could be
extinguished without guilt. Eventually all moral issues were put aside
and the true horror of base animal survival took over. It was frail
humanity versus a brutal universe in the form of an alien species that
had no other urge but to feed and breed. Like in Jaws we saw so little
of the creature that our imaginations took over and created a world far
worse that any that could be put on screen. In a way to put in on
screen is to exorcise the demon and face the tangible fear. But to keep
it in the shadows was brilliant. I can think of no better horror movie
of this kind.
