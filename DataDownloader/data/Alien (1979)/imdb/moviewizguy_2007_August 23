When commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, heading back to Earth,
intercepts an SOS signal from a nearby planet, the crew are under
obligation to investigate. After a bad landing on the planet, some crew
members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they
discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship&#39;s computer
deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of
the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in
until it is too late.<br /><br />So, like every classic, I always watch them so late so there&#39;s no
surprise here. I was really looking forward to the film, since it was
being called a horror or sci-fi classic from people to people. But the
problem with that is that the ending and some memorable scenes tend to
go out in public for people who haven&#39;t seen the movie, like me.<br /><br />So the first 20 minutes passed. Nothing special there. I honestly
thought the action would start right away because I&#39;ve seen AVP before
this movie so I expected things people wouldn&#39;t expect because the film
was made 1979 and I&#39;ve seen it in 2007. I knew the ending and I kinda
knew a bit of the middle so that probably lowered my rating for this
movie.<br /><br />One other reason why I might not give this movie a perfect rating is
the clich&eacute;s. Of course, if I&#39;ve seen this movie in 1979, it wouldn&#39;t be
called clich&eacute;s but to let you know, so many movies pulled off the same
clich&eacute;s so I can&#39;t help myself but roll my eyes when characters do
stupid things to get themselves killed.<br /><br />On a better note, I love this movie for its intensity, thrills, and
suspense. Actually, there is one pop up scene, probably the only pop up
scene, that made me yell out loud. That&#39;s how suspenseful the movie is.
The death scenes are well made since you wouldn&#39;t know how they would
die (but you would certainly know who would die).<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver&#39;s performance as the heroine was, I suppose, heroing
and tough. The special effects were decent, as for the Alien design. I
have to admit, though, the last 15 minutes of the movie was annoying
because of the light flashing constantly on the screen, to heighten
tension, of course.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t say this is the greatest movie ever. If I&#39;d seen this in
1979, my opinion might be different, but no, this is 2007. I would say
this film is a great sci-fi thriller which keeps the suspense and
tension throughout. Other from that, there&#39;s nothing else to say about
this movie.
