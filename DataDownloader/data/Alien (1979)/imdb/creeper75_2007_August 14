To me, this is the mother of all alien movies. Sure, there was alien
movies before it, but ALIEN set the stage for all the great modern day
alien movies that followed. It spawned a handful of sequels that were
every bit as good as this one, but none ever surpassed it. Sigourney
Weaver was perfectly casted for this movie and I for one will never
forget her performance in this one and the few that followed. This film
has a great mix of science fiction and horror, something a lot of
similar movies fail to achieve. Also, it has some really good special
effects for its time and I feel as though it has gotten over-looked by
todays young audiences. If you liked Alien vs. Predator, and you have
never seen the original ALIEN movie, then you need to go back and watch
it and all the sequels to understand where this movie left its mark on
alien movies of today. An instant classic and a definite MUST SEE for
Sci-Fi and Horror fans alike.
