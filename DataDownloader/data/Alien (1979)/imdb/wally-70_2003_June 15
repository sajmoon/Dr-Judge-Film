This movie was so terrifying I had to leave the theater. I was physically a
wreck for a week after seeing it, nightmares etc. Even the SECOND time I
watched it, on cable, I had to shut it off before the ending. It took me
three times to finally make it through.<br /><br />That is to its credit. The film is revolutionary. Its filming style was
casual and intimate which brought you right into the atmosphere the
characters were experiencing. It was freaky, with strange surprises like Ash
the robot. The alien itself was only seen in horrifying glimpses making your
imagination fill in the terror. The sets were dark, noisy and full of
shadows.<br /><br />
