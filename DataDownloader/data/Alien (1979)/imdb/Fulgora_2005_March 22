It's amazing how more than 25 five years (hell, I'm 25) after its
release, Alien still reigns as a major landmark in film making,
especially in the science fiction and horror genres. Any new film that
comes out that features either space ships, or monsters, or both, will
be compared to Alien. And 99 times out of 100, it will fall short.<br /><br />Maybe where Alien succeeds and most fail is at building a sense of
tension that is almost unbearable at times. Ridley Scott explores the
desolation of space, bringing it into the space ships and making it
nearly a character in the film. Add to that a monster that is scarcely
seen throughout the movie (remember that old rule in horror, that says
that the less you see it, the scarier it is?), and you have a
masterpiece that refuses to get old.
