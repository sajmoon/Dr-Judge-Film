Alien is not a bad movie. In fact, it&#39;s a pretty good one. More of a
thriller than the sci-fi/horror ones that its sequels were. But therein
lies my only problem watching the Director&#39;s Cut when it was
re-released in the theater. I was reminded what a slow, borderline
boring movie it is for the vast majority of its running time. Still, it
was the only one I hadn&#39;t seen on a big screen, so it was cool to see
it. I&#39;ll still take Cameron&#39;s Aliens over this any day. For that
matter, I&#39;m one of the few who actually liked Fincher&#39;s Alien3.
Resurrection, well, I liked a lot about it, but there was plenty not to
like as well.
