My rating 4**** out of 5<br /><br />Alien remains one of my favorite Sci fi flicks. Sigorney Weaver, Tom
Selleck, Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright, and Yapott Kotto fighting a space
Alien. Who could forget the other mouth coming out of the Alien's mouth.
What a great film. Ridley Scott handles the film with great care and Jerry
Goldsmith's music is just great this might be one of the greatest 70's sci
fi movies of all time. Predator was made in the 80's which was kind of like
Alien. The Intruder Within was a made for t.v movie which was a nice clone
and Alien was later followed by three sequels some were
great.
