1999_October 13 

At this point in time, I have seen up to Alien Resurection &amp; I still have to
admire the original concepts in Alien.  This film had chills, it was gross,
it kept you on the edge of your seat, I liked it when I first saw it &amp; still
do.  It still is scary, even when you know what is going to happen.  Great
acting, special effects, directing, etc.
