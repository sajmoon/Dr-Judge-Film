What can I say except that this is &quot;the&quot; film to study for atmosphere, mood
and production values as well as pacing.<br /><br />It is really next to flawless, Scott is easily one of the best directors
working today and I think that it is perhaps the best Sci-Fi film ever
(sans
2001 which I consider to be more than Sci-Fi) made.<br /><br />Astounding visuals you won't see anything like it, it is truly a must see
for fans of all walks of life you certainly won't see anything like this
again.
