Alien is a true horror sci-fi classic.  The film is a staple of american
cinema and one of our only true masterpieces!  Sigourney Weaver made her
big
screen debut as the film's leading lady. A heroine that would go onto to
develop and influence every female heroine that came after her.  It all
starts when they investigate a strange signal coming from a nearby planet.
They investigate the source and one of the crew members is attacked by a
deadly E.T. They bring him aboard the ship and in a exquisitely terrifying
scene the alien is born and gets loose upon the ship. It begins to grow as
it feeds and soon comes fater the remaining cast members. With scenes that
set the standard for every suspense scene ever filmed. Ridley Scott
directs
the film with horrific pizazz piling on the horror laden suspense and
intelliegent and convincing performances. The direction is taut and the
cinematography is claustraphobic and intense.
