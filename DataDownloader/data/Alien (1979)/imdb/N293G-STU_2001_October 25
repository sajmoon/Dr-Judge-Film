'Alien' is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever to grace the silver
screen.
It is also one of the scariest. Technical limitations (ie, the alien was a
guy in a suit), meant the creature is not seen as much as was first
proposed. Like 'Jaws', this 'less is more' scenario worked to the film's
advantage - it became scarier as we never really got to see the whole
alien.<br /><br />Visually, the film is top notch. Enlisting the talent of surrealist H.R.
Giger was a masterstroke. His visualisation of the alien life cycle is
superb and engrained on the public conscious (the horrific John Hurt
sequence is the main reason for this).<br /><br />The sound department also did an ace job on the film. All the eerie music,
alien screams, computer noises etc are superb. This attention to the sound
helps darken the atmosphere, essential for a horror film.<br /><br />All of the actors give very good performances as the mining ship crew.
Sigourney Weaver is particularly strong but my favourite performance comes
from Sir Ian Holm as Science Officer Ash. A brilliant actor, Holm plays his
part in 'Alien' to perfection.<br /><br />In general, I would thoroughly recommend 'Alien' to anyone who has not yet
seen it. Made in 1979, some things look a little dated but I defy anyone
who
is not shocked by 'the John Hurt scene' the first time they see it. Simply
a
masterpiece.
