Easily one of Ridley Scott&#x27;s finest films, and one of the best of the
sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production
design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The
pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the
editing is great, Scott&#x27;s direction is superb and the story is
wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also
thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is
just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine
jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as
Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film
history but a contender for Weaver&#x27;s best ever role. It is a delight
seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the
curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10
