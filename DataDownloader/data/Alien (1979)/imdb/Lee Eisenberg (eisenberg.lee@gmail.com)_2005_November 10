There may be debates over whether movies should portray aliens
positively or negatively, but &quot;Alien&quot; shows that all bets are off. This
is possibly THE perfect sci-fi/horror flick; in fact, it doesn't even
suffice to call it such. From the moment when the egg attacks Kane
(John Hurt) to Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) battles against the
title character, this movie has you tensed up every second of the way.
You may be very suspicious of every movement around you after watching
this movie.<br /><br />Obviously, what made &quot;Alien&quot; so great was that it had a woman going all
bad-ass on a big ugly creature from another world. You probably know
about the &quot;chest&quot; scene (or maybe you've seen a spoof of it), but you
have to see it to believe it! All in all, this is a great movie. Weaver
turns in a top-notch performance, and great support from Hurt, Harry
Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright and Tom
Skerritt, add to the movie's high quality. &quot;Aliens&quot; was also pretty
good, &quot;Alien 3&quot; was tolerable, and &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot; was...well,
that's debatable. But this one remains the best. 1979 was truly a great
year for movies, what with &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Being There&quot;,
&quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, &quot;1941, &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; and &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.
