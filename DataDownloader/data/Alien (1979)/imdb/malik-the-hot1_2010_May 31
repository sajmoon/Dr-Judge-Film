this film is overrated and i expect everyone to stay away from. The
movie itself is very slow, outdated. Opening scenes look like some old
spaceship movie based on outerspace landing, the movie is so dull it
keeps you waiting for anything to pop-up, although i must admit it is a
bit creepy, but too slow. I watched this movie alongside the predator,
and i must say the predator is far entertaining movie, i eagerly wanted
to see an alien with something innovative, but it lacks what the
predator has i.e: heat vision and array of weapons. The alien movie
reminds me of the film relic released in 1996, accept that sorry to say
that relic has an edge over this one, because its more entertaining,
rather than this boring farce, which i regret wasting my time on, the
only decent alien movie of the franchise has to aliens, all the rest
after that have been worse than even this one. 3/10
