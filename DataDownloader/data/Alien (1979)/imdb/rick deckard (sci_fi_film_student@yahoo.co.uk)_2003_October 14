More than any other science fiction movie of the seventies; this Ridley
Scott classic married the genres of sci fi with the horror genre. From the
haunting first presence of the mining ship, Nostromo to the end credits,
this film can still rivet the viewer to their seat, as HR Giger's alien
creation progressively wreaks havoc on all members of the ship's crew.
Maybe
it is only in space where no one can hear you scream, but this deftly
crafted film can still raise hairs on the arms of those whose home is
terrestrial. A truly memorable achievement by Scott complimented by an
outstanding cast including John Hurt and Ian Holm as well as a confident
performance by Sigourney Weaver.
