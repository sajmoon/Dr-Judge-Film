Having watched the new Directors Cut of the film. I am reminded of when
I first viewed it in 1980. I was in awe of the great sets, the
claustrophobic feel of the space ship and the fact I could relate to
the crew. I think it works well because 1. It has great set designs and
the direction of Ridley Scott is excellent 2. The crew is convincing
with that corporate image and you can relate to the criticism of the
company. (Truckers in space) There is a hierarchy which is both male
and female and the engineer team who feel they are belittled, but
vitally important. 3. It was the first time a female was the lead
action hero role which had been predominantly male. And though some may
think that a half naked Sigourney Weaver was unnecessary. It makes her
role all more powerful as she shows vulnerability in the presence of
the alien. 4. Considering when it was made the overall feel of the
spaceship looks very genuine and you feel that you are on the ship. 5.
The Alien too, is convincing, not a rubber shark like creature but
again a believable baddie. 6. It must have been difficult to try and
make the film with a Hitchcock feel to it but the twist in the film is
excellent. 7. To capture fear on film is not an easy task but Ridley
Scott achieves it- which is what makes Alien a classic of its genre
