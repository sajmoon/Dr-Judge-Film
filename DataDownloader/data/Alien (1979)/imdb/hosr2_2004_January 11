I saw this film again recently on DVD. I remember it's release - came out
the same time as Clockwise &amp; the latter filled up the cinemas whereas me and
my friend were alone in the cinema for Alien (a very scary experience!).
Then it began to catch on, until it became one of the great cult films of a
generation.<br /><br />Re-seeing it reminded me of how fabulous this film is. It's got everything,
from brilliant acting to wonderful cinematography. The dramatic tension is
unmatched by any film in any genre. The underlying story helps. And I
remember being quite shocked in '79 - many people thought space was going to
be 'nice'. The idea that a creature would exist with the all-out drive for
survival at any cost wasn't featuring much in popular culture.<br /><br />I don't think any sci-fi film before or since matches this (not even Scott's
later Blade Runner). An outstanding film which stands the test of
time.
