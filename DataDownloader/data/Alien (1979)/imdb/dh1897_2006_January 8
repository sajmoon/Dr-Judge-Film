Brilliant design, cinematography and ensemble acting.The strength of
this film is that, unlike its sequels, it has relatively little gore,
and instead slowly and calmly builds up a sense of suspense and stark
fear. Cold and detached in its storytelling. This is my favorite sci-fi
film of all time.<br /><br />Designs by Hans Rudi Giger, Ron Cobb and others are so otherworldly in
appearance, that it more than anything before it (with the possible
exception of 2001:A space odyssey)makes the audience feel convinced
that all this is possible. Cinematography is equally beautiful, and the
cold tone of the film, coupled with its patient sense of pace, makes
this an original that makes its sequels (by lesser directors) pale by
comparison.<br /><br />The acting by all seven actors is superb. No one is the star, all are
essential. <br /><br />As Star Wars is set in a fictional world in no specific time period, I
do not consider it to be actual science fiction, but a brilliant space
fairy tale. So as much as I love the Star Wars saga the title of sci-fi
champion belongs to Ridley Scotts Alien
