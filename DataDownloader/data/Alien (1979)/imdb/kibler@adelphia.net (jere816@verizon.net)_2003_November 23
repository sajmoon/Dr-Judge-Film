Alien - Mining spacecraft lands on a distant planet while investigating an
SOS and an alien life form hatches from its egg to wreak havoc for the crew.
Well-paced, visionary space-horror film takes time getting started, but
emerges as an unnerving grabber; has jumpy jolts, slime, and
stomach-churning shocks. Oscar winner for Visual Effects. Director's Cut
version, including a digitally remastered picture and extra footage, hit
theaters in 2003. Sequel: ALIENS. <br /><br />*** (out of ****)
