while ridley scott's direction is flawless, the only place i have always
felt that this film falls short of the second one is in the acting and the
depth of the characters. granted, with it being the first in the series, i
can forgive it for this flaw.
as a sci-fi/horror film, alien is a great example of how to properly combine
the elements of both genre. plus, it's got some nice gore and the alien
itself is one of the most memorable monsters in movie history.<br /><br />while i rank the second movie as my favorite, it's really unfair to compare
the two since the first is a horror movie and the second is a war/action
movie.
both films are great and worth watching multiple times.<br /><br />rating:8
