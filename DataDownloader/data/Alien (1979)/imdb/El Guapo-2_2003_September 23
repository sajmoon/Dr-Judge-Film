I have this little theory... that talented filmmakers often do their best
work (notice I said talented?) with their first couple of features.  If the
talent shows any promise, the film gets noticed, makes money, wins a few
awards.  When you've got nothing left to prove, you lose that hunger that
drives you for success, the hunger that only lets you get 3 hours of sleep
each day, the hunger that gives you that attention to detail over every
little thing.  &quot;Alien&quot; is truly the work of an artist obsessing over every
little detail and nuance.  The set design, cinematography (Adrian Biddle,
one of the great british cameramen), special effects and visual effects
(considering it was the late '70s) are all top notch.<br /><br />Scott, who ironically would come to be known in the 80's for his cleverness
with chiascuro (thanks to such insipid tripe as &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Someone to
Watch Over Me&quot;), willingly settled into his director-for-hire mode that he
remained in until breaking out with &quot;Gladiator&quot;, truly a stunningly epic
film, despite the limitations of the screenplay which was basically a
revenge or die story.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; takes it time, long and leisurely, setting up the character
development, the arc of the plot, and slowly turns up the intensity to the
scary climax.  The film has aged somewhat, due in no small part to Cameron's
sequel &quot;Aliens&quot;, which owes more to Heinleins novel &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; than
it does to Scott's &quot;Alien&quot;.  <br /><br />This film has haunted my imagination since I first saw this film when I was
13 years old... The cinematic themes of dark betrayal, such as the
corporation of the film essentially using the crew of the Nostromo as a
&quot;mule&quot; for the Alien, were still new to me.  Perhaps I had too much time on
my hands, but I often would think about how Ripley said if they had brought
the creature on board, then they would all have had to spend time in
quarantine upon their return to Earth.  Then, in a dark moment of mabacre
creativity, I realized perhaps the company had created the alien through
genetic engineering themselves, sent it out to that planet, and then planned
to use the Nostromo crewmembers to bring back the Alien species to Earth to
use as a form of biological warfare.  It kind of puts a neat twist on the
film, since they never did explain where exactly that crashed spaceship (The
&quot;space jockey&quot; creature) came from.
