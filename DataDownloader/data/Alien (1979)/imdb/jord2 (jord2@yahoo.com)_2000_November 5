2000_November 5 

When one brings up the subject on horror movies, your first thought is of
the &quot;Scream,&quot; &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series.
But then you think a little harder, about the good ones--&quot;The Exorcist,&quot;
&quot;Rosemary's Baby,&quot; &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and &quot;Alien.&quot;<br /><br />I admit, I have yet to see &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; but to this day, &quot;Alien&quot; remains
the creepiest movie I've ever seen (and when I say 'creepiest,' I mean that
it did not leave a lasting sense of fear...it was just 'creepy.'  I still
have yet to see a movie that will actually scare the wits out of
me).<br /><br />Nothing prepared me for &quot;Alien.&quot;  I already knew exactly what was going to
happen, and I still found myself in the dilemma of who would live and who
would die.  The suspense was incredible, almost unbearable--at the end of
the movie, I felt like I was gonna hurl!  Not because of the gore (I've
actually got a pretty strong stomach for that), but because of my
connection
to the characters trapped aboard the monstrous Nostromo.  The feeling of
hopelessness, despair, stranded in the middle of nowhere and awaiting the
inevitable was so effective, I almost couldn't take it.  The claustrophobic
sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the
ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with
surprisingly
good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science
fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into
the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.<br /><br />Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time
the
baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing
scene!  Oh, but don't watch &quot;Spaceballs&quot; before watching this...it'll make
it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around
him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We
had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we
could
really feel for them, a feeling of &quot;It's not fair!&quot;<br /><br />The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film,
somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end
with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing
from
all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I
had
seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.<br /><br />And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide
what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see
dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse
of
what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over
lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him.
We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with
blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second
mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even
answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the
body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the
heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just
me.<br /><br />Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't
see a resemblance in his directing between &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; (or
&quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; for that matter) besides stunning sets and
stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film
as
well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in
this film).  &quot;Alien&quot; will always remain one of the most inventive and
influential additions to cinematic history.
