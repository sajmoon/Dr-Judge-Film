The commercial mining ship and refining ship the Nostromo is returning
to home through the outer rim. The ship&#39;s crew of seven are in
hyper-sleep, only called to action in the most dire emergency, with the
ship running on automatic, the corridors empty, the bridge lifeless.
Until an alien SOS is broadcast and the crew&#39;s blissful slumber is
broken so that they can help. The crew clearly don&#39;t like each other
and this is not a Star Trek style Utopian existence, they are
co-workers cast together, they do the job and live to together in a
clutch of uneasy alliances.<br /><br />As they realise they are not near home and have been awoken for another
reason, they are, by the nature of their contracts, required to
investigate. A three man team is assembled but as time goes on and more
of the alien message is deciphered it appears that it is not an SOS but
a warning, and from this point on claustrophobic movies will never be
the same again.<br /><br />Alien is one of the greatest horror films of all time, preying on all
of our most primeval fears, fear of the unknown, fear of being eaten
and fear of something inside destroying us, all of these fears are on
show here with perhaps the most prevalent being the fear of the dark
which this film does supremely well, without it being so dark that you
can&#39;t see what is happening (A la &quot;Alen 3). The script builds up slowly
but purposely allowing the feeling of unease to grow inside us but
without being boring or tiresome. The performances are all top notch
with all the leads doing their jobs to perfection, with everyone
playing their parts like it&#39;s a kitchen sink drama which again, makes
the horror that much more terrifying as the ordinariness of the
performances leads to terror that we can relate to perfectly.<br /><br />I can&#39;t remember much about the score but it does not detract nor take
anything away from the film so I guess it must be good. The direction
is Ridley Scott&#39;s best ...Yes, better than &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and better
than &quot;Gladiator&quot;. However, although this film is Ridley&#39;s best work, it
hasn&#39;t lead to a career of mediocrity, rather a career that has lead to
quality, consistency and continued invention.<br /><br />Aliens is okay and three and four aren&#39;t worth looking at, but thirty
years later this is still a chilling and inventive horror that is as
unsettling to watch as it is enjoyable.<br /><br />PS Final thought. Sigourney&#39;s dressing in the space suit is still one
of the sexiest scene&#39;s in cinema history, and I still don&#39;t know why?
