(Five out of five stars)
Think about it:  Take away the outer space setting and the fact that the
killer is a wicked alien monster, and, basically, you have your classic
people-locked-in-a-house-with-a-murderer body count slasher flick.  No,
really.  Watch it again, and you'll agree that this is like an expertly
directed haunted house/slasher film in space, with the huge mother ship
and
all of its clunky chambers and winding, labyrinthian corridors
substituting
for the old, dark haunted house.  In fact, I think this film stands alone
(with Carpenter's remake of &quot;The Thing&quot; and Cronenberg's remake of &quot;The
Fly&quot;
not far behind) as one of the best horror movies AND science fiction films
of all time -- quite an accomplishment.  The insectile, H. R.
Giger-created
alien is one of the most frightening and evil-looking creations of its
kind,
with rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth and jaws inside of jaws -- this
thing is nasty.  As Ripley, the ultimate, kick-butt, action-movie heroine,
Sigourney Weaver heads a great cast (Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm as
the eerily detached medical officer who is not all that he seems, Yaphet
Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright).  This also has one of
the best poster tag lines ever:  In space, no one can hear you
scream.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHT:  Geez, take your pick.  Of course, there's the hugely
famous
chest-bursting scene, in which the egg that was implanted in John Hurt's
stomach by that spidery, face-clinging thing doesn't quite agree with him;
or there's the other famous, claustrophobic scene with Skerrit, armed with
a
flashlight and a heat sensor, chasing and then being chased by the alien
through dark, endless ventilation shafts; and you can't forget Ripley's
frightening final encounter with the alien after she thinks she's safe and
sound in her escape pod (doesn't anyone know they're never safe and sound
in
these kinds of movies?); and the list goes on and on. ...
