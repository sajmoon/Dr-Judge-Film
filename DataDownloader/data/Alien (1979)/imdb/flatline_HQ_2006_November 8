Well, I would have thought this movie to have been far better than what
it was.Perhaps I&#39;ve been spoiled by the special effects that litter
modern day films of the same nature, but I wasn&#39;t buyin&#39; the guy
crawling around in an &#39;alien&#39; costume one bit.<br /><br />Many people hail Ridly Scott for his directing talents, I on the other
hand find that he is a little bit over-rated. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he
does a fantastic job with all that he does, but he doesn&#39;t seem to push
the envelope; he does as is expected to get the job done, but not too
much else.<br /><br />That being said, Alien was probably the hardest film to do out of the
entire franchise, origin stories always are. Aside from this film, I
have only watched the second installment before writing this review so
as not to taint my views too much.I think the best thing about &#39;Alien&#39;
is that it left a lot of room to expand and improve.<br /><br />So on the final report I may say that do to the dry and almost
pointless dialog at times and the poor attempts at astonishing us with
lots of flashing buttons, as well as &#39;satisfactory&#39; direction I would
give this 5 out of 10 only to add another point for a total of 6
because without this film we may not have seen &#39;Aliens&#39; or the others
to follow.<br /><br />It&#39;s worth watching, especially to study the development of cinema.
