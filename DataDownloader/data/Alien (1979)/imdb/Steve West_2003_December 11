Recently saw the Directors Cut version in the cinema, much, much better
on
the big-screen than on the horrible 20-year old VHS tape I saw it on the
first time last year. It's wierd, I saw Alien the last out of all 4 Alien
movies, I used to watch Aliens when it was on TV every year in the late
80's/early 90's, must have seen that half a dozen times.<br /><br />I imagine that watching Alien for the first time back in 1979 before
anyone
knew of the &quot;Aliens&quot; must have been incredible, I felt a little closer to
those original Alien watchers with my big-screen experience. The movie
had
much more impact, was more immersive and made me jump slightly several
times
in the cinema. I'm not sure what scenes were added for this version but
it
seems surprising that scenes were cut in the first place considering the
running time is under 2 hours.<br /><br />Alien is a damn good film, pipped at the post by Aliens for all-around
best
Alien film. Alien is definately the scariest of the lot and is an expert
film in every regard (I'm still not sure about the use of dripping water
though). The film had a slightly &quot;Thing&quot;-ish quality in that there's a
lone
beast that can stike at any time, and it's not clear who is friend and
who
is foe, it was good to see all these now well-known actors in younger
bodies
trying to save their own skin.
See this at a cinema get if you get the opportunity, or watch the DVD on
a
big screen with surround sound in a darkened room.
