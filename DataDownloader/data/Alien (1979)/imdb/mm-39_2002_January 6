This film is okay, but the more I watch it the less I like it.  The film
does not age that well.  This film must have been a real shocker in 79, but
very average in 02.   I guess the build up from Aliens 2 gives this film a
big let down.  A creature runs around the ship, and we have a bunch of hack
and slash.  It is worth seeing the first time, but I would not want to watch
it a second time.
