Just yesterday, I re-watched Ridley Scott's classic 1979 science-fiction
epic &quot;Alien.&quot;  I haven't watched &quot;Alien&quot; in about two years and in that
time, I've felt that the movie now seems dated and has lost its impact. 
Really, not so as I found out yesterday.  I watched the director's cut that
was part of the 9-disc quadrilogy set and I have to say that this movie
really got to me this time, which has never before happened when I've
watched this.  I have always liked James Cameron's &quot;Aliens&quot; as my favorite
movie in the series (and it still is) but I feel I have to rethink a number
of thoughts I have towards the original.<br /><br />First, Ridley Scott is an amazing filmmaker and his work in this film has
only been matched by David Fincher's direction in &quot;Alien 3.&quot;  What I mean by
that comment is that Fincher matched it in atmosphere, not like James
Cameron or Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director of &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;), both of
whose visions were more action-oriented, much rather than suspense.  Just
three years after making &quot;Alien,&quot; Scott would go to direct Harrison Ford in
&quot;Blade Runner.&quot;<br /><br />Second, the production design.  Everything just looks so dark and eerily
beautiful.  The space scenes are almost hypnotic; we've gotten so used to
seeing space in the movies that it rarely surprises us anymore.  With the
production here, the space scenes are really stand out and show us that we
really aren't alone in the universe.  The scenes on the alien planet are
truly scary too.<br /><br />Third, the acting especially by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  She looks so
young in this movie (she was only about 24 when this was made).  I liked her
character a lot in this movie in that we see shades of her future role in
&quot;Aliens.&quot;  The rest of the cast is pretty sufficient too, especially from
Veronica Cartwright as Lambert.  We see in later scenes the fear in her
character.  I somehow got the feeling that she was really on the verge of a
nervous breakdown.<br /><br />Fourth, the movie itself.  &quot;Alien&quot; is a downright scary and effective
science-fiction film.  It's a landmark film and has spawned an incredible
afterlife in not only comic books and three highly successful sequels, but
also a rival series (&quot;Predator&quot;).<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; - 10/10
