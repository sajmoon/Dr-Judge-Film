I first saw this movie when I was about four years old.  I loved Doctor
Who
at the time and loved all the sorts of &quot;aliens&quot; with laser guns and
such.
My dad rented out Alien at the local video store and I thought it would be
a
movie with &quot;Dr. Who&quot; type aliens in it.
Boy - I was wrong and I was totally scared out of my brain by this
movie.<br /><br />Alien is an absolute classic.  The plot is simple enough and I found that
it
tended not to focus on all of the characters (to gain sympathy for them).
Because the Alien is so terrifying and horrific, you find that it doesn't
need to do this ...<br /><br />Another brilliant masterstroke of this movie is the heroine - Ripley.  I
find it great that there is a female hero of this film - it makes it a lot
scarier and adds a sense of vulnerability.<br /><br />The actual design / special effects of the Alien is also quite
brilliant.<br /><br />I find that this is the best movie of the 'Alien&quot; series (even over the
sequel - Aliens). This movie could be one of the best movies of all time.
