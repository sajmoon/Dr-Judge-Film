Without a doubt the best movie in the Alien series. I know many people tend
to like Aliens (1986) much more. I'm not one of them. It's hard to beat this
classic. Even though the special effects aren't quite as good as in the
later movies it's much better. You don't get the same feeling from the other
movies. Many people seem to focus too much on special effects and not about
the story and that's a shame. You don't want to miss this one. It's a movie
everyone should have seen!
