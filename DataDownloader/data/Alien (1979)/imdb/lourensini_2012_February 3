Directors must realize that ain&#x27;t darkness that build a thriller. It&#x27;s
the plot. And I&#x27;m not going to do a personal review saying the movie is
amazing just because Ridley Scott directed it.<br /><br />Alien is too much overrated. And except the fact it&#x27;s a pretty original
movie, it has nothing to call my attention. There ain&#x27;t nothing amazing
about the actors and the plot is mostly predictable. You can see whats
about to happen since they get out from the spaceship to explore
another lost ship in a distant planet. <br /><br />The Soundtrack follows whats going on in the movie, thats nice (or is
the minimum music producers should do. But it ain&#x27;t no The Untouchbles. <br /><br />The worst part is the constant dark screen. And when it ain&#x27;t black, is
black and blue. Of course, its supposed to create a thriller
atmosphere. But it doesn&#x27;t. It just makes you try to imagine what the
f**k is going on through the hole movie. <br /><br />Actors perform well (but not impressively), at least if we compare this
to Alien Ressuraction.<br /><br />The reason I&#x27;m giving it a six it&#x27;s just because Alien its and amazing
creature, smart and with incredible capabilities to procreate without
and male (through parthenogenesis, I assume). And to kill whats near by
it without even feel threatened.
