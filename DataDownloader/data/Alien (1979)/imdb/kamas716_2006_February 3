I have watched this movie dozens of times, almost as much as Star Wars,
and it still scares me. It's scary because it built tension the old
way, like Hitchcock did. It's scary because of what it doesn't show
you.<br /><br />I was only in grade school when this came out, and my parents wouldn't
let me go to it. I finally saw it on video years later and was totally
blown away. One of the best sci fi movies ever, also one of the best
horror movies. I really wish I had seen it in the theatre.<br /><br />I would say this is the 2nd best sci fi series (behind Star Wars). Even
though it has a different feel from the later movies in the series,
it's still my favorite.
