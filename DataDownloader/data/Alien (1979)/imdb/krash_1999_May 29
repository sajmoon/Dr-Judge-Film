1999_May 29 

What do people see in this film? I am not one for horror films, though I
do
like this alien stuff. Nothing happens in the film. Nothing. We spent most
of the time waiting and waiting for something to happen. This movie could
have been cut to half an hour, easy. There is a saying that says that fear
is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really
well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far.
Rather
than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we
wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the
special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago so we can't
expect too much, but look at Star Wars which came out around the same
time.
They were much better than alien and Lucas had half the
money.<br /><br />Alien is simply a boring movie that deserves no credit.
