Thsi is an excellent movie. Its movements are slow, spades, spasmodic,
very sexy. Voluptous, cherry, sensual ... It is a hit! It goes slow:
The jelly in your stomach will never stop moving: Catch it and run.
Akira Kurosawa, the master, would have loved to ate this one but it was
already produced in the Chinese tense: present, past and future, it&#39;s
all a flan. The secret of this movie is as follows: The people in the
Boat (no relation to Cornell University, they speak in secret because
they are perverts) are so scared of their aborting a secret mission
because it involves an extraterrestial crew that seems to be
particularly active: It swallows humans. If you liked -INVASION OF THE
BODY SNATCHERS-, watch it! This master 20 Century classic movie, will
film your verbs like Pipi Longstocking will jump down from that Budha
tree: Buddha was not G. Patton! The tense means to say G. Patton was
not Pato, lest Plato. You will love this aliensL: They are bad as Hell!
