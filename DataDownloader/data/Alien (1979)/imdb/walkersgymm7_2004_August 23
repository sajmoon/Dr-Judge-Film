This has been hailed one of the greatest Sci-Fi/ horror movies of all
time. I want to know who was the first person to ever say this! If you
know e-mail me! This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen
in my entire life!! It was so incredibly slow with no action or
excitement at all!! The plot was bad and the script was worse!! But the
worse thing of all was Sigourney Weaver she is such a talented actress
and she didn't express any talent at all in this movie!!! I can sum up
the plot in a few sentence fragments. Stupid spaceship, gets infested
with Alien Species. AHH!! People die and Sigourney's main goal was
saving some animal, I forget if it was a cat or dog. She abandons the
spaceship kills alien and life moves on!!
