Got to go against everyone here, but another outdated Scott film which left
me bored.<br /><br />It took too long to get going, was very cliched but worst of all had no
character to warm to at all. Infact it was probably a collection of every
type of negative characteristic in people somewhere in someone in this
film.<br /><br />A good ten minutes of this film is wasted on not one but two scenes of
people searching for a cat. After the tedium of that the attempts to scare
was usually in the form of a big bang.<br /><br />Weaver's hardly in it until the last half hour &amp; when she is she comes
across as an unconvincing hero(ine). There's little charcter development
with her or anyone.<br /><br />As my concentration wained things became a little confusing. I must've
missed the explanation of why there was cat on the ship, or what went on at
the end with the 5 minute count down to override the ship (when she was
trying to escape). Despite all the ammunition there was a amazing lack of
enthusiasm to use the gun &amp; on an alien who we never really got to see that
clearly.<br /><br />I enjoyed 'Sphere' of all films as I got into the plot and could play along
with the mystery, so thought I'd give this a go as it was recommended by
more than one correspondant. Unfortunately, not only was there no real
suspense or horror in this. There was nothing to entice the viewer to
engross themselves in the plot.<br /><br />3/10<br /><br />
