Ridley Scott established himself as a master of atmosphere with this
groundbreaking sci-fi film.  Space would never look the same with H.R.
Giger's disturbing, sexually tinged visuals and Ron Cobb's grungey vision
of
commercialized space.  Treat yourself to the 20th anniversary edition DVD
and see just how visionary this film was...and still is.
