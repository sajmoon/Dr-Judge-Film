Alien is one of the best movies ever! It is intense, scary,
suspenseful, violent, and bloody. I love the thrill of wondering where
exactly the alien is and where he will strike next. Also anticipating
the death of a character is fun. Alien looks good. The costume is
amazing in detail and the acting is perfect. Alien is slow to start but
it&#x27;s worth the wait. Now you are definitely wondering why Alien is not
a perfect ten and that reason is the darkness. Alien is extremely dark.
On my small T.V. I can barely see anything. Almost all of Alien is
nearly pitch black. You need a pretty big T.V. to get a good visual
experience. If you own a DVD player you should see alien as I gave it a
nine out of ten so it is a movie to see.
