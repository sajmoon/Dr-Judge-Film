Perhaps the biggest thing to strike us about Alien is the fact is was
originally released in 1979. To watch it now it's hard to realise it's
nearly 25 years old. Few films of this genre that have come after it
(included it's own sequels) have come even close to matching it's suspense
and shock value.
Back in 1979 when first released, cinema audiences were treated to a roller
coaster ride of terror few expected. Little was really known of the film so
when people sat down and witnessed the scenes now infamous to us all, it
really shocked. Many thought Alien was going to be another one of those
B-Movie sci-fi fares - how wrong they were.
Set in the not too distant future, the crew of the Nostromo are returning to
earth with 20 odd million tonnes of mineral ore, when they are re-directed
to intercept a distress beacon which they have picked up. On investigating
the beacon, they come across a derelict alien craft which appears to have
crash landed on a small, barren planet. 3 of the crew investigate the craft,
and find thousands of alien eggs containing parasitic life forms. One of the
crew ends up being attacked by one of the life forms. Soon afterwards, the
Alien makes it's appearance in one of cinema's most gut wrenching scenes
ever. The Nostromo now has 6 humans and 1 horrific Alien life form on board,
which has nothing more on it's mind than slaughtering all living
life.
The scenes in Alien are some of the most tense and atmospheric you will find
in any film new or old. The Nostromo looks creepy and unwelcome, and the
fact that the Alien could be lurking around every corner the scared witless
crew turn, your heart is always in your mouth.
The sequels of Alien have been varied. First sequel Aliens is actually
regarded by many to be the best in the series. But for a tense, atmospheric
and genuinely frightening experience, Alien is still the best. And if you
can see the new Director's Cut which has been released, well it's even
better.
