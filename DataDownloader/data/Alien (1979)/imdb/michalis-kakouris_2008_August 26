I agree in general. I cannot say it is the best movie ever but
certainly in my opinion one of the top. The problem of rating this and
other older movies is the fact,that most people tend to compare it with
contemporary film making. This is totally wrong. When we saw Alien i
was a student in England in my teens. People were leaving the theaters
scared to death!!!We never had a similar experience in the past. It was
the scariest movie we have seeing up to that time. It&#39;s being copied
ever since thousand of times, but never surpassed even by Aliens, which
also is a very good movie, an action thriller and not a sci-fi as this
original. The creature is also the meanest, ugliest, scariest and
perfect alien ever designed. It is the perfect killing machine, and
this what makes the film so interesting. The humans are helpless when
confronting it, and although technology has advanced they are still
very weak compared to it. I think that if there is a moral issue coming
from Alien is that we have to be humble no matter how much we advance
scientifically. Alien is the punishment for our arrogance, an arrogance
which is obvious in the early stages of the movie. I would give it a 9.
