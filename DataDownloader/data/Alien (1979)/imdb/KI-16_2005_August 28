This film was by far better than all of subsequent followers. It dwarfs
the others as a matter of fact and actually made the others easy to do.
Become the film laid out a masterful template. Attempting to re-release
this film today would be a huge mistake, the generation has no patience
for the type of style and setting up of a story that this films
delivers. They want action and explosions right out the gate. They want
horror but this films delivers terror which is totally different from
horror. Terror stalks you and haunts you until your nerves are
completely shattered and then it resigns. Only to return just when you
feel you have a grasp on what just happened. Horror on the other hand
is the end result of what you found terrifying. The film plays so deep
in the mind that it is hard to escape the images.<br /><br />When the film first opens up with the shot of the ship. Like a haunted
house, I felt like death had entered the ship and oddly enough the
first person it touched was Kane. He was the first to be awakened by
deaths hand. The soundtrack was perfect! The cast, perfect! I've
watched this film so many times it would be embarrassing to say. I
absolutely love this film for it didn't pretend to be like any other
film. The idea that space had been conquered and people traveled
through as casually as traveling to other parts of the country and then
have something truly terrifying happen. It's like the &quot;Deliverance&quot; but
in outer space, an easy trip turned into a nightmare.<br /><br />There were so many great lines in this film, but one of my favorite is
when Ripley asks Parker about how much time before the ship blows. &quot;How
much time before the ship blows?&quot; &quot;Ten minutes!&quot; &quot;No bullshit?&quot; &quot;If we
ain't got of here in ten minutes. We won't need no rocket to fly
through space!&quot; Classic, dark humor in moments of complete despair.
