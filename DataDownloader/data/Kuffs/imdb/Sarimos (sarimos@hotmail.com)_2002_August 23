<br /><br /> &quot;Kuffs&quot; is a movie which it shows you the serious, tight, and humorous
aspects of the police force. Christian Slater shows us in &quot;Kuffs&quot; that early
in his career that he can be up there with all the best. Along with the
legends, Slater tells us that he does have the potential to become the best
of the best. Along with other movies done by Slater (Broken Arrow, Interview
with the Vampire) he shows us in &quot;Kuffs&quot; that as an actor he can become
emotional, serious, and funny all in one character. Although Slater wasn't
nominated for an oscar in &quot;Kuffs&quot; he should of in my book. And perhaps for
others who enjoy the action/comedy type of movies. Just about anyone who
watches this movie will get something positive from it.
