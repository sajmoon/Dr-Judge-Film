I just saw Kuffs and can&#x27;t believe I have never ever heard of it
before. It stars Christian Slater as George Kuffs, a slacker/loser who
leaves his pregnant girl friend. His brother runs a privately owned
police agency (they are not the official police of San Francisco but a
title at the beginning of the movie explains that since sometime in the
1800s they have set up privately owned police agencies in different
districts around the city) and after some strange circumstances Kuffs
ends up being one of these &#x22;sheriffs for hire&#x22; tracking down the
vicious gang that was going after his brother. There are some good
jokes and the action is okay it also doesn&#x27;t have too much swearing or
nudity or blood/guts so it is okay for most people, PG-13 and safe at
that rating even.
