1999_March 6 

I liked this movie.  I thought it was pretty good (especially Christian
Slater's performance- What a hottie!!).  I don't think it is the best movie
in the world, but it isn't the worst either.  It is one I would recommend
for ANYONE who loves either Christian Slater or violence.  (I loved the
scenes where he is in the shower, and the one where he is cooking for his
date with his shirt off!!!)
