Christian Slater is the ne'er-do-well, yet the impressionalbly<br /><br />hip title character in this decent action comedy. George Kuffs<br /><br />is a high school drop out who decides to take over his dead<br /><br />brother's police patrol and to avenge his death. Kuffs stumbles<br /><br />his way to find to his brother's killers and manages to make a<br /><br />real image of himself. Slater is fine as Kuffs, whose constant<br /><br />joking around might have irritated the folks around him, but his<br /><br />humor really paid off, in this comedy flick that might remind a<br /><br />few Slater fans of his other avenger movie, &quot;Gleaming the Cube,&quot;<br /><br />except &quot;Kuffs&quot; is way funnier and more good
