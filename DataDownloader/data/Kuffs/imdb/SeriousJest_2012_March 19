This film has decent camp value, which is actually helped by the
passage of time, because it is now even more evident how ridiculous
early-90s fashion was. Hence, the villain with the T-shirt of his own
picture (which was actually a fad back then) is even more hilarious.
Also, Evans took chances with creative camera shots and sound, and they
paid off. This movie simultaneously pays homage to, and makes fun of,
movies like Beverly Hills Cop...although Slater is not as funny or
personable as Eddie Murphy. Jovovich, on the other hand, came across as
very sweet and endearing, and looked very pretty...I wish she got more
screen time. Hard to believe that was 20 years ago; she&#x27;s aged well!<br /><br />You should focus on the film&#x27;s irony to really appreciate its value. It
doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously, and neither should you. However, in
the end, there were too many mediocre and unfunny (even in an ironic
way) lines and moments to justify recommending that you spend time
watching this movie. If you do get dragged into watching it, however,
you probably won&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s just...okay.<br /><br />For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com
