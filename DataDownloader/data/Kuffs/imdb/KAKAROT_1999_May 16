Most people only remember her as the girl dancing in her underwear in the
beginning.<br /><br />Milla plays Kuffs' girlfriend, Maya. She is so good in this movie, she is
so
good in every movie. Through the movie Maya and Kuffs are fighting.<br /><br />I like this movie because it marked a certain point in Milla's
filmography.
It was one of the movies where people started noticing her as an
actress.
