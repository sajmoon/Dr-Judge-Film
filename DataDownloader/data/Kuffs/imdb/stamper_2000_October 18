This is a typical revenge action film in which there is really nothing much
to look out for. At the beginning it seems to be really going somewhere, but
that changes fast. To make this quick this film has: no cool action scenes,
no cool or good dialogues, plenty of overdone shooting (Kuffs is way too
lucky), no jokes and well it has one nice thing Milla Jovovich. But in this
film she is featured not just only seen for a short time but she does not
have a great role either. One thing is nice though, you see her hopping
around in her underwear.<br /><br />Do not see this, unless extremely bored (like I was) and you might even be
able to sit through it<br /><br />4 out of 10
