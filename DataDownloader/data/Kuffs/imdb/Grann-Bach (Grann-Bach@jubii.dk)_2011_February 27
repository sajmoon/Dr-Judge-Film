Kuffs is a young moron(with *attitude*!) who wants a lot of money
without doing anything for it. His brother dies, leaving the district
to him, and the killer goes free because of red tape. How can he run
it? He has no skills or experience. Well, I&#x27;m gonna have to get back to
you on that, because this doesn&#x27;t answer that. Does he try to get
revenge for his sibling? Of course. How leader-like. Slater&#x27;s dubious
charm is put to the test and fails, and the painful asides exist for
little other reason than to deliver exposition. There&#x27;s plenty of
backstory and details, and hardly any of it is on the screen... it&#x27;s
said in dialog. Instead, we get lousy attempts at comedy(usually silly
to the point of being cartoonish... it&#x27;s hardly ever funny, and the
running gags literally physically hurt) and... occasional melodrama.
The whole thing is scored by Harold Faltermeyer, and yes, he was indeed
still doing the Eddie Murphy style 80&#x27;s tunes. This does the buddy cop
thing a little, awkwardly. All the characters are quirky. Who thought
this weird mix of things that can work separately would work? All of
what I&#x27;ve described can be good if you pursue one. This skips back and
forth between them all. The 97 minutes sans credits pass extremely
slowly. You never get into it. You&#x27;re given no reason to like anyone in
this(what&#x27;s with Ted? Did they think that they&#x27;d cast the supercop dude
from the Police Academy flicks?), except for Jovovich(beautiful and
cute as usual... even if she wasn&#x27;t legal yet), and she&#x27;s barely in
it(and no, my dislike of this isn&#x27;t on account of that). The setups do
not make sense, they&#x27;re just there for sit-com scenarios that don&#x27;t pay
off. Why can&#x27;t George aim when it counts? We get some OK action, all
shootouts. The tension is lacking and the choreography is lazy. And you
do not give someone dual Berettas in a film and not have them use them
way more. The clich&#xE9;s are plentiful. One portion has a lot of bizarrely
bleeped out F-bombs(using &#x22;notes&#x22; on a keyboard and other random
noises, taking you completely out of the fiction)... it&#x27;s as if they
suddenly realized they should go for PG-13 instead of R, and made the
bad decision to censor it like that. It&#x27;s also half-heartedly
photographed. The DVD comes with a meh 2 minute theatrical trailer, and
the suggesting of watching Dazed and Confused(maybe that&#x27;s so, haven&#x27;t
seen it) and Sneakers(...no. Just no. It&#x27;s so much more entertaining
than this that you can barely imagine it) if you like this. I recommend
this to girls who want to fawn over Christian. Everyone else, you can
do far better. 5/10
