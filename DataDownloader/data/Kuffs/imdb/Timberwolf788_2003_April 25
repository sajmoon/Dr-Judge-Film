This is one of the best action-comedy movies that I have ever seen. The
movie is full of hilarious one-liners, and action too. The plot is very
original, not like a scheme I have ever seen in a cop film before. Don't
watch this movie expecting it to be like Lethal Weapon, this isn't a film
to
be taken seriously. It's about a young, renegade 20-year old who takes
over
a special police unit after his brother, who ran the unit, was killed.
This
is a good action-comedy that will keep you laughing through the whole
film.
And Milla Jovovich is in it to boot...yeah, I'm a guy, sue
me.
