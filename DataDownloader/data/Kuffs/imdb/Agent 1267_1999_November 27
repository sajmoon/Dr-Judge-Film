1999_November 27 

This movie was filled with thrills and chills.  I was on the edge of my seat
and couldn't wait to figure out what happens next.  It was a touching
portrayel of a young menace to society turned into a cop because his brother
is killed and he seeks revenge.  He ditches his girlfriend Maya (played my
Milla Jovavich) because he finds out she is pregnant.  This movie was the
coolest action packed movie ever!  It's a must see, totally.  I mean, who
needs experience when you got attitude?
