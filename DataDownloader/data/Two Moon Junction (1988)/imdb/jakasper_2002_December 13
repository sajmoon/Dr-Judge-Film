I saw this film in a movie theater when it first was released. A man in
the
movie theater I was in yelled out &quot;what's the point?&quot; during the movie.
The
point of this movie is to provide visual and aural candy for the eyes and
the ears. TMJ has two very attractive and sexy leads in Sherilyn Fenn and
Richard Tyson, and the soundtrack nicely compliments the action. No, it's
not Shakespeare, but it's fun.<br /><br />Zalman King loves to show beautiful women in his movies, without worrying
too much about a plot or dialogue that makes sense. All my women friends
that have seen this movie love it, because we as women all love looking
at
hunky Richard Tyson. Enough said.<br /><br />Another erotic movie to check out is &quot;Delta of Venus&quot;, also by Zalman
King.
It does actually have a plot along with lots of sex. Anais Ninn (the
author
of &quot;Delta of Venus&quot;) would be proud of Mr. King's effort on this
one.<br /><br />This is one I have viewed many times, because it is such a great fantasy
and
a kick. Kristy MacNicol and the rest of the supporting cast is great too.
I
think this film will appeal more to women than to men. Just don't take it
too seriously...
