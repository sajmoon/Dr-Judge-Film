Though no one won any awards for their acting in this movie, it is worth a
look.  If you go beyond the overt storyline you can start to see nuances
that point to the more complex psychological makeup of the characters and
takes this movie to a different level.  This is why I like this movie, it
isn't just raw sexuality but the complexity of human relationships further
complicated by societal standards and expectations and how one choses to
integrate them.  This film not only features veteran actors such as Burl
Ives and Louise Fletcher, but features Richard Tyson whom you may remember
from the tv series Hardball, and Sherilyn Fenn.  And check out Samantha
who
is played by Milla (as in Milla Jovovich who played in The Fifth Element).<br /><br />You would probably like this movie if you liked 9 and a Half Weeks or Wild
Orchid.
