The first time I saw this movie I was in college and I went to a girls
house to hang out, she put in the movie and told me that it always got
her hot. Well she was right! The plot and acting is pretty lame but it
has the desired effect. This movie soon became the &#x22;sure thing&#x22; movie
among my friends when having girls over to watch a movie. Every one of
us had a lot of success thanks to this movie! The girls never realized
that they were watching a movie that was made to get them hot and
bothered. I had my wife watch it, and she thought the movie was pretty
B rate....but the results were the same!! <br /><br />I love this movie!!!
