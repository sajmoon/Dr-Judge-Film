Richard M. Tyson and Sherilyn Fenn are super hot together. Great movie,
much
better than the Zalman King's first hit movie, &quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot;.  The whole
scenario of rich Southern belle meets muscle bound trucker is campy, but
steamy.  Look for great cameos by Herve Villachez and Christy McNichol.
One
of my favorites!
