Here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is
possible for a movie to fail. Terrible writing, terrible acting,
terrible directing...what we have here is an unmitigated disaster.
There isn&#39;t much of a story at all and what little story we have is
basically just one ridiculous clich&eacute; after another. Sherilyn Fenn plays
April, the young, beautiful Southern belle from a wealthy family who is
about to marry some successful but boring guy. Inevitably she falls for
the big, dumb hunk who shows up completely out of the blue. And there&#39;s
your whole movie. That&#39;s it. Most of the dialogue is laughably bad but
the filmmakers hope to distract you from this by having Fenn take off
her clothes at regular intervals. Well, I guess we should be thankful
for anything that distracts from the unintentional comedy which ensues
anytime anyone speaks in this movie. Someone actually read this script
and decided it was a good idea to make this movie? Fenn and Richard
Tyson, who plays the object of her desires, are quite bad here but you
almost can&#39;t blame them as the script gives them absolutely nothing to
work with. This movie just miserably slogs along until just when you
think things can&#39;t get any worse Louise Fletcher, playing April&#39;s
grandmother, gives a quite serious speech about just how important her
family&#39;s silverware is. Yes, they&#39;ve been handing down these spoons for
generations! Do you know who ate with these spoons? Oh boy, is this
bad. It&#39;s the most laughable moment in a movie which is basically
nothing but a series of laughable moments. An awful script, amateurish
directing and some really lousy performances. That about sums it up.
Terrible, just terrible. Stay far, far away from this one.
