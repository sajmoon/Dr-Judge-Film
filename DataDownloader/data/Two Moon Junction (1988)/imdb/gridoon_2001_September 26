This film doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.

King's direction is ultra-stylish and Fenn and Tyson make an attractive
couple (the film will appeal to both sexes). It still plays like an
extended
TV commercial with soft-core overtones, but at least it almost constantly
keeps its tongue in its cheek, which turns out to be a big plus. Clever
ending, too.    (**1/2)
