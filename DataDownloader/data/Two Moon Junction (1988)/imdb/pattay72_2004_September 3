I remember watching this movie with some high school girl friends and we
absolutely loved it. It was a nice little sexual fantasy film with just the
right tone, like Body Heat, but with well orchestrated sex scenes and a
dreamy background. I could feel the longing in the characters. It was just a
little bit naughty and a little bit nice. Too bad most of the lead actors
never made it very big because how beautiful they all were. Even Christy
McNichol was good.
