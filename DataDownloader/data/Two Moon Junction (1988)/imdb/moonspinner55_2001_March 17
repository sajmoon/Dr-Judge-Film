It&#39;s a two moon travesty when peroxide blonde Sherilyn Fenn rebels
against her society family and fianc&eacute; to rip the T-shirts off Richard
Tyson, a carny hunk in tight jeans. Lousy attempt to mine the same
erotic territory as &quot;Nine 1/2 Weeks&quot;, but at least that film had a
competent director...this thing&#39;s got Zalman King (you know right away
where he&#39;s coming from: he keeps the girl naked and begging). Kristy
McNichol shows up in a cameo played for high camp value (she gets naked
too!). A couple of lines made me laugh, but film is embarrassing when
it tries to get serious. The crux of this garbage is that Fenn&#39;s
character can&#39;t make a decision without stripping and crying, stripping
and crying. Maybe she should have dumped Tyson for McNichol? *1/2 from
