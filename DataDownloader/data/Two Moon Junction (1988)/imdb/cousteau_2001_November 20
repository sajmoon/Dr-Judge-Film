I have to admit that, of Zalman King's films, the only other one I've seen
is &lt;In God's Hands&gt;-which is not erotic, but very sensual- and this is
the only 'erotic' film I've ever really watched. <br /><br />   Having said this I let the film be what it wants to be; erotic. Nothing
more, nothing less. If you watch &lt;Two Moon Junction&gt; having
preconceptions about how erotica HAS to involve bad acting, or a lame
script, you won't let its passion take over your film experience. I have to
admit I wasn't particularly interested in the acting as much as the
chemistry between the characters. I felt the acting fine, and chemistry
top-notch=)<br /><br />   Not many people have seen &lt;In God's Hands&gt;, a film about three
nomadic surfers, but just in case you either have or are planning to see
this other Zalman King &quot;great&quot;: After seeing it, you will appreciate what
King was trying to put forth in &lt;Two Moon Junction&gt; after seeing
&lt;In God's Hands&gt;. Passion. Sensuality. The difference is TMJ is erotic
wheras IGH was about the surfer mentality and spirituality. In both films
however, what you see and think are not as important as how you feel while
you're watching them. The whole is greater than the sum of their
parts.<br /><br />   Richard Tyson as the lead may or may not be adequate for guys, although
attractive to most of us women. But whether you're a chick or not, you will
find Sherilynn Fenn outright gorgeous, point blank. She's beautiful, sexy,
sultry, seductive, mischievous, etc...not to mention a platinum blonde with
a charming Southern accent. (Watch for a few tiny but oh-so-precious Milla
Jovovich scenes=)<br /><br />    Overall this film obviously isn't an Oscar contender, because there is
no category for &quot;most sensual film&quot;. But the fact that this is a
little-known gem with a LOT of sex appeal,- no taboos, no manipulations or
even morals to shove down your throat- is what gives this film its unique
appeal, and &quot;the sky is the limit&quot; sexual power; the less preconceptions you
have, the more you will enjoy the film =) 
  <br /><br />    Did I mention the soundtrack perfectly complements the eye candy and
captures the mood of the film? Another Zalman King strength.
