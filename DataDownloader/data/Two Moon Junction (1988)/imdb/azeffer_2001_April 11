It wasn't so bad.  The leads were attractive.  Richard Tyson is a real
sexpot, and Sherilyn Fenn as the pretty blonde at times looks like Madonna
from her &quot;True Blue&quot; period (remember the slicked back platinum hair?).
Louise Fletcher is creepy as usual.  It was strange to see Kristy McNichol,
who I think of as the cool tomboy or wholesome girl playing a trashy,
slutty
drifter.  Although I actually think she pulls it off.  Definitely a late
night movie.
