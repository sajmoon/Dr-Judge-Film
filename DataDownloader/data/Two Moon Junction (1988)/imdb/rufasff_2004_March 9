Though Fenn is very pretty, I'm a little surprised so many found this sexy,<br /><br />even..well... GOOD.  Too bad we have heard so little from this actually
quite witty 
actress since &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;<br /><br />   That said, TMJ is great silly trash fest fun; with some real mind bending<br /><br />cameos from once respectable stars.  I remember I saw this with a friend
after 
we read the synopsis in the paper, and I thought, &quot;I have to see this&quot;. I
was not 
disappointed.  Burl Ives, who had been assumed dead(by me) for at least a<br /><br />decade, was the capper. What would Rudolph say?<br /><br />         Highly recommended &quot;so bad it's good.&quot;<br /><br />
