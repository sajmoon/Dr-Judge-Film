2008_October 8 
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the worst film I have ever
seen.... and, over a period of 50 years watching films, I have seen
many bad ones. The script is embarrassingly risible, the direction is
pedestrian but the acting is dire, dire, dire..... how come these
people get paid?. The two lead characters look, for most of the film,
like the cardboard on the back of a cereal packet. I have never rated
Sherilyn Fenn very highly... her performances in both Boxing Helena and
Twin Peaks were, to put it mildly, amateurish but in this film she
makes even a piece of dead wood look like an Oscar winner.<br /><br />I managed to sit through only 20 minutes of this rubbish before
switching off the DVD and throwing it away! Erotic???? There&#39;s more
eroticism in a wet paper bag floating down a drain in a rainstorm!
Zalman King should take up dominoes instead.... he certainly can&#39;t
direct a film and, as for his script..... my 5 year old grand daughter
can string words together to create better, more interesting and
cohesive sentences than his.<br /><br />This is an insult to the film industry.<br /><br />Even if someone offers you money to watch it... don&#39;t.... avoid it like
the plague!
