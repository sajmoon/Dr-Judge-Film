a glossy, self satisfied, pretentious yarn from mega bore mr. zalman king
about a southern belle who meets this muscular geezer at a fun fair who
gives up her beau in order to fill enough screen time to keep the raincoat
brigade happy. that's about all i could make of it. at one point she
decides
to go back home then comes back to this bloke, gets shafted (cue another
gratuitous to some but i don't mind sex scene complete with overdone
pouting and stupid visuals. i was so angry with her at this point that i
wanted to slash the seats but i forgot i was watching it at my own place
and
not the theatre. ha!
