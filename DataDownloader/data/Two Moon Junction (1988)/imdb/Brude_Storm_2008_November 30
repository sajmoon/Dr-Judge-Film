4 Stars is too low for this surprisingly strong film. Yes, it&#39;s a
Zalman King movie, but it was among his first and unlike probably
everything else he did since, was a very good movie. It has a good,
tight story and some very strong performances from its leads,
especially Richard Tyson (who really should have become a big star but
just never quite did for some reason).<br /><br />I still believe that it is among the sexiest movies ever made, and that
is not possible if you do not care about the characters or are drawn
into their passion. Most movies of this type fail to engage the viewer
in the story and so the passion and sexuality suffer, but that is not
the case here. One doesn&#39;t need to watch this movie as an excuse for
some cheap titillation, it also delivers as an enjoyable film as well.
