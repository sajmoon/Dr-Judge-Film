The interesting thing is not that we have another &quot;Lady Chatterly&#39;s
Lover,&quot; nor that unlike its namesake, it does focus on the prurient as
its anchor.<br /><br />No, the interesting thing for me that it is set in the south. When this
came out, as now, the south of the US has all sorts of cinematic
baggage. The husky boys are more animal, the rich boys are more daftly
aristocratic, and the girls more vapid. Its a land created for
cinematic stereotypes.<br /><br />So the deal is that while we are distracted by a few nipples, there&#39;s a
more powerful story chugging along here, one that feeds the Chatterly
story by casting a world in which no one controls any emotions, where
guns and trucks are the first things you expect, and where the large
are small.<br /><br />Ted&#39;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
