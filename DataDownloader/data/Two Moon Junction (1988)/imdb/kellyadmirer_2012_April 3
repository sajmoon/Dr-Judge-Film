Sherilyn Fenn stars as a young woman just out of school,
dispassionately destined for marriage to her cipher of a hometown beau
(Martin Hewitt in a truly thankless role). She feels something lacking
in her life, now what could it be? Turns out that it&#x27;s that handsome
carny (Richard Tyson) who just blew into town and only lives for the
moment. Too much is riding on the wedding (a huge estate goes to her
and so on and so forth) for her to blow it off and follow her
&#x22;passion,&#x22; so what&#x27;s a girl to do?<br /><br />You don&#x27;t watch a film like this for the plot (it comes full circle in
a showery kind of way), because there really is no plot. Instead, you
watch for the atmosphere, the characterizations and the nudity and sex.
And there&#x27;s plenty of all those things. In fact, there&#x27;s so much that
they are all over-done and you find yourself actually wishing there was
a plot worth watching. Only at one point, when there&#x27;s a Deputy with a
shotgun, do we feel anything remotely similar to dramatic tension, but
that blatantly melodramatic cloud passes quickly. Assorted potentially
interesting characters appear, say a few words, and enter oblivion, and
Sherilyn at one point implies she has a hidden agenda, but it turns out
it&#x27;s only what&#x27;s hidden under her clothes. Then, we&#x27;re back to the
atmosphere and the....<br /><br />One of the things that makes this a cult classic is the numerous
absolutely inexplicable cameos. We get Kristy McNicol, Herve
Villechaize, Don Galloway, Louise Fletcher, Juanita Moore, Milla
Jovovich (all completely and utterly wasted except McNicol, who does an
energetic wild-girl impression), and mother of God if it isn&#x27;t Burl
Ives playing the heavy. This would only have been better as a camp-fest
if they could have gotten ol&#x27; Burl (and he looks like he is on his last
legs) to sing &#x22;Holly Jolly Christmas,&#x22; but the minimal soundtrack is
pretty good in an 80&#x27;s sort of way despite that unfortunate omission.<br /><br />The cameos are amusing, but they are simply curiosities, kind of like
Art Garfunkel of all people turning up in Sherilyn&#x27;s later, also
completely campy, &#x22;Boxing Helena.&#x22; Here, she literally spends half of
her time on camera either completely naked, half-naked or wearing
outfits in which she struts around as if she might as well be naked.
Tyson must not have owned many shirts, because he spends the same
amount of time bare-chested. If you like that sort of thing, this film
delivers. They flirt like crazy (the best part of the film), Tyson
self-consciously strikes as many Ralph Lauren model poses as possible,
they take motorcycle rides, they meet by the lake at midnight, so on
and so forth.<br /><br />Sherilyn weirdly ends her last sex scene crying (after doffing her
clothes about as quickly as is humanly possible), and she later tried
to pass that off as being uncomfortable showing so much skin. But she
also chose several years later to pose for Playboy, so who knows what
was really running through her mind.<br /><br />Fenn and Tyson are both extremely attractive (though Sherilyn sports
some of the most unattractive hairstyles possible), but Tyson runs
rings around her in the acting department (and Olivier he&#x27;s not). The
second and last time Sherilyn tries to throw a hissy fit, it looks like
even she doesn&#x27;t believe she can pull it off convincingly, and it dies
stillborn, like the plot. Thankfully, she doesn&#x27;t bother attempting a
Southern accent, while others like Galloway try to sound like Colonel
Sanders. She says &#x22;You frighten me&#x22; and it sounds like &#x22;pass the milk,
please.&#x22; You probably won&#x27;t be watching her (usually naked) scenes and
thinking about her thespian talents, though.<br /><br />I really like this film, and every time I watch it, I&#x27;m amazed at what
they got away with back then (if you like this one, see &#x22;Mischief&#x22; as
well). It is that rare mainstream film that broaches the topic of the
female libido (which word comes up at the only amusing juncture in the
film) and follows though all the way. There are a handful of truly
classic shirt-rippers from the &#x27;80s, and this leads the pack.
