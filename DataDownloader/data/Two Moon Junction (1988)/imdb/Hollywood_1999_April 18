1999_April 18 

A total waste of time, Two Moon Junction. The name may sound fancy, but
trust me, the movie is far from that! Sherilyn Fenn
(April) is supposed to get married in a few weeks, and she meets this chap
from a carnival, and goes to bed with him. The reason??
Simple.She's'looking
for excitement! Sherilyn Fenn is totally wasted in this movie. Anyone
who's
seen her in Three of hearts will know what I mean. Overall rating...2/10.
Stay clear.
