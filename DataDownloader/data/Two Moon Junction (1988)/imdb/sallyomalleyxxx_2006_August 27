This is, without question, the most hilariously bad movie I have ever
seen in my life. I&#39;d give it one star, but its very badness makes it
entertaining! Bad script, bad acting, bad music, bad hair: hysterical
from beginning to end. I&#39;m serious, by the end I was exhausted from
laughing so hard! Even the scene where the dog dies is funny, and I&#39;m
the type who cries buckets over Old Yeller.<br /><br />I&#39;m not even going to bother discussing the so-called plot, except to
say: rich gal, engaged to successful guy, meets buff carnie worker and
falls in love with him. Many shirt removals ensue.<br /><br />As for the &quot;soft porn&quot; some critics have touted, it&#39;s disappointing. I
keep hearing that women like this movie. All that tells me is how
pathetically under-served women are by the film industry, that they
would be grateful for such paltry crumbs as these. Yes, Richard Tyson
is attractive (except for the hair) but you hardly get to see any of
him. He occasionally takes his shirt off, whoop de doo. Is his lower
body covered with horrible burns, or something? It must be, because
nudity in this movie is confined to the female characters. Time and
again the camera focuses lovingly on Sherrilyn Fenn, who, by the way,
makes having an orgasm seem like an unpleasant chore. One wonders if
she&#39;s ever actually had one.<br /><br />Even the makeup is incompetent. There&#39;s this one scene, after Tyson&#39;s
character gets beaten up, where he has what looks like a perfectly
round hole in his forehead, and he and Fenn are having sex, and it&#39;s
supposed to be hot, but you keep seeing this weird hole in his head and
laughing...OMG, it&#39;s sooooooooooo bad. I&#39;m shocked to see so many
positive reviews of this ridiculous clunker. 2 out of 10 stars.
