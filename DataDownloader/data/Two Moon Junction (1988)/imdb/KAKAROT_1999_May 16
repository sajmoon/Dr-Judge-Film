Milla plays the little sister of Sheril Linn Finn in Two Moon Junction.
In
the movie, Two Moon Junction is a bar that is Sheril Linn Finn's favorite
place to go.<br /><br />The reason I think other people liked this movie is that it is about a
young
girls rebellion. A girl that is not yet ready to get married. Most girls
like
this movie.
