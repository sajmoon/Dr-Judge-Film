This movie is funny as hell and has tremendous camp value. See it for over
the top performances by Oscar winners Louise Fletcher and Burl Ives, and
lousy performances by Kristy McNichol and Richard Tyson and. Outdoing them
all is Sherilyn Fenn, who owns the screen.  This is Southern fried garbage,
but Fenn is having an extravaganza!
