gets it on with hunky,I mean top choice Richard Tyson. Those scenes
burn up the screen...<br /><br />Check out the scene at the carnival where Fenn sees bare-chested
Tyson... George Thorogood and the Destroyers in background.<br /><br />Great supporting cast of Burl Ives and Louise Fletcher( One Flew Over
Cucukoo&#39;s Nest/nurse Ratchet fame) <br /><br />Fenn and Tyson melt the screen. I was surprised when I &quot;stumbled upon
this flick&quot; back then after reading a lukewarm review in the NYT. The
part the &quot;Times&quot; forgot was the erotic/almost soft porn love scenes.
Whew!
