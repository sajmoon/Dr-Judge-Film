Hot Shots! is the only film of its kind that I actually have taken a
liking
to. Mostly because I love aircraft and Top Gun. Otherwise, this kind of
humor is greatly overrated - it's a bit childish and somewhat tiresome to
see people get hurt in hundreds of different ways. But this film is
bearable.
