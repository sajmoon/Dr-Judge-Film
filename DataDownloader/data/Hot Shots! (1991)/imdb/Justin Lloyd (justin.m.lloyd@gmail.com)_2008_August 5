This movie is a lot of fun to watch. Yes, there&#39;s a lot of spoofing
going on, and one comedic line after the next, but unlike spoofs of
today, they actually make sense and bring together a cohesive story.<br /><br />That said, the other strength of the film is that, comedy aside, there
actually is a storyline going on, and its pretty good. You feel like
you&#39;re watching a movie, instead of a string of stupid &quot;hey this is
from this movie&quot;, &quot;hey that&#39;s from that movie&quot; scenes strung together.<br /><br />Lloyd Bridges is fantastic as the clueless admiral, Carey Elwes plays
one of the most egotistical jerks I&#39;ve seen, and Charley Sheen&#39;s comic
timing with his lines really bring this one together.<br /><br />The other great part is you don&#39;t even have to have seen the movies its
spoofing to understand what&#39;s going on or to laugh at the jokes. One of
the best movie spoofs there is.
