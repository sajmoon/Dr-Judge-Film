&quot;Hot shots!&quot; is a great movie.
It will keep you laughing from the begining to 
the end. It has some really unusual
gags thrown in gratuitously, making it crazier
and funnier by the minute. I highly recommend
this comedy to all every one, and I guarantee
that you will not be disappointed in this one!!!!!!!!
and hey, don't over-look the sequel!!!!!!
I give this excellent comedy 4.5 stars out of 5.
