The current IMDB rating of 6.1 is, in my opinion, waaay too low for this
gem. The movie is a spoof of mainly top gun, with jokes making fun of
various movies throughout. All the jokes are silly jokes, not witty subtle
jokes. But still quite quite funny. The jokes are similar to the leslie
neilson police squad type of jokes. I give it 8/10. If you like Leslie
Nielson/Mel Brooks type spoofs, this is the movie for you.
