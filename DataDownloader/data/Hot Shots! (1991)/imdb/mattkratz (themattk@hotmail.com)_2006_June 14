I think this was a decent send-up of the Top Gun movies and other films
as well. (Dances With Wolves, etc.) There are many hilarious scenes,
such as Jon Cryer&#39;s &quot;Wall Vision&quot; and Charlie Sheen&#39;s Indian nickname
translating as &quot;Fluffy Bunny Feet.&quot; You know something bad and funny is
going to happen when Dead Meat reveals all that he&#39;s carrying-right
before he goes on a mission. Charlie Sheen gives a truly hilarious
performance as Topper-a man on a mission, in more ways than one. The
Superman and Dances With Wolves scenes are inspiringly funny, and the
movie was overall a good one. I recommend this to anyone who likes
comedies and spoofs.
