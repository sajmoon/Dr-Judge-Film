If you like spoof movies, then this is the movie for you.  I just got done
watching it for the 10th time and still found myself rolling off the couch.
This is how spoofs should be done, not so over the top that it loses it
grounding (Wrongfully Accused) or throw jokes blatantly in your face a mile
a minute hoping some of them will work (Baseketball).
