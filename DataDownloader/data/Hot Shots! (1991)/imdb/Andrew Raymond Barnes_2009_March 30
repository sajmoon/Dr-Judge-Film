I recently caught up with this one for the first time since it came out
and it still made me laugh heartily throughout, and hysterically in
places. This is from the time when spoof movies were really FUNNY and
not disasters of scripting and direction, relying purely on visual
gags. This one has a story that is expectedly thin ( but consistent)
and characters that shine -and none so more than the wonderful Lloyd
Bridges as Admiral Benson. He is pricelessly funny every second he is
on screen with such intense deadpan delivery that one cannot help
laughing, even before he opens his mouth. Characters who are so mad and
bizarre are always fascinating, but especially so when figures of
authority and power are portrayed, and a great actor inhabits the role.
The two leads play tongue in cheek performances with the proper
seriousness, and the supporting cast is a mixed bag. There are some
great visual gags and also many movie references, which is always part
of the fun of this type of movie. I have to also say the flying scenes
were excellent.
