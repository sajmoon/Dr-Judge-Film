Jim Abrahams &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is Slap-Stick Fun! It&#x27;s deadpan hilarious &#x26;
earns itself a viewing. Believe me, if you want to have a full-hearted
laugh, then &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is waiting for you. <br /><br />&#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; Synopsis: A Parody of &#x27;Top Gun&#x27;, in which a talented but
unstable fighter pilot must overcome the ghosts of his father and save
a mission sabotaged by greedy weapons manufacturers.<br /><br />You can&#x27;t look for logic in &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27;. This is Slap-Stick stuff, in
which, it&#x27;s the humor that has to work, nothing else. In that
department, &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; clicks &#x26; how. It parodies &#x27;Top Gun&#x27; to the
hilt, and the overall jokes &#x26; story-telling, is truly laugh-out-loud
funny! <br /><br />Abrahams &#x26; Pat Proft&#x27;s Screenplay is ingenious. Abrahams&#x27;s direction on
the other-hand, is highly energetic. Cinematography is satisfactory.
Editing is decent. <br /><br />Performance-Wise: Late/Great Lloyd Bridges steals the show with a
performance that will you in splits! Charlie Sheen is adequate. Cary
Elwes is in full form. Valeria Golino is perfect. Jon Cryer brings the
house down with several hilarious moments. Kevin Dunn is good. William
O&#x27;Leary is passable. Ryan Stiles stands out in a small cameo.<br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is Slap-Stick Cinema At Its Best!
