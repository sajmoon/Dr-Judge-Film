This is one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve seen, and I still get sucked
into it on cable when I surf by and see it. Jim Abrahams directed and
co-wrote it with Pat Proft, and they nailed it. It&#x27;s a spoof of Top
Gun, and they get everything right.<br /><br />The cast is the best: Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Lloyd
Bridges, Bill Irwin, and more. There&#x27;s no use trying to describe the
movie&#x27;s plot or run through the jokes. If you haven&#x27;t seen &#x22;Hot
Shots!,&#x22; go see it now. If you have seen it, it&#x27;s time to see it again.
It&#x27;s a comedy not aimed at junior high boys - well, they may think it&#x27;s
funny, too, but who cares. Competent adults will roll on the floor with
this movie. The follow-up, &#x22;Hot Shots, Part Deux&#x22; is just as good.
