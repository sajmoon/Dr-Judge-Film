I didn't appreciate this movie the first time I saw it.  The second time I
loved it--and it's only gotten better over time.  This movie is so chock
full of memorable funny quotes it ranks up with the old Mel Brooks films,
Python, and Airplane.<br /><br />Lloyd Bridges is simply hilarious as the senile naval commander.  His role
in this movie and it's sequel is one of my all time favorites.
