I generally don't enjoy movies that are built around sight gags, but this
one starts hard with surreal gags and simply does not let up.  Hardly five
seconds go by that you don't see something truly absurd, and they manage to
get in some pretty funny material as well.  Old Man Bridges is truly
inspired as the doddering old admiral, but mostly because some of his bits
are just so darned funny.  Just thinking about what he says after falling
down the stairs always cracks me up.  Surprisingly, Charlie Sheen is just
irreverent enough as Topper Harley aka Fluffy Bunny Feet to pull it off. 
I've seen the movie several times, and can STILL spot new gags, that's how
tightly they're packed in there.  So if you're in an absurd mood, and can
enjoy a well done gag film like Airplane, you'll probably enjoy
this.
