Hot Shots, part 1 is my number 125 movie. It has great humor and it is very
funny. I think part 2 was about twice as funny. Of course, it has not a good
story and not good actors, but it just wants to entertain and it did. Mainly
it is a parody on &#132;Top Gun&quot;. I consider this movie as one of the Top50
comedy movies. 
It could have been better, but it is good. The more you watch it, the more
you will see any details that you have not seen before. So you watch this
film over and over again. <br /><br />All in all, I rated this movie 9/10 and recommend it to comedy fans,
especially to fans of The Naked Gun and Hot Shots 2. If you have any
questions, feel free to ask them.Cu; Rinho
