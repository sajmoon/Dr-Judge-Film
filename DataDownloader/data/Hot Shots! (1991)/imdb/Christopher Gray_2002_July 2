The makers of Airplane! decide to make fun of the highly successful Top
Gun.
And the movie is fine. It's not amazing or spectacular but has its moments
of comedy that show that whatever you did to see this movie is not
wasted.<br /><br />Topper Harley is wanted to test out a new plane for the navy and meets up
with a rival, an attractive secretary and a loony Admiral(brilliantly done
by Lloyd Bridges).<br /><br />It's not a long film but it's fine to watch when bored though watching it
time and time again may drag the jokes out of it. ***
