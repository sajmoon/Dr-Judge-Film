A great comedy, indeed - but some scenes are funnier than other. I
regard the piano scene in the first part of the movie as one of the
best parodies I've seen! And that's not only because the Gershwin tune
is better music than &quot;Makin' Whopee&quot;... - Valeria Golino shows comedy
of top class doing this hilarious remake of Suzie Diamond.<br /><br />Lloyd Bridges also brings several funny moments into the movie. Nearly
80 years old when the movie was made, he shows that age means only a
little compared with skill and experience.<br /><br />Finally, one may wonder why every successful comedy has to be followed
by a sequel that hardly makes you laughing...
