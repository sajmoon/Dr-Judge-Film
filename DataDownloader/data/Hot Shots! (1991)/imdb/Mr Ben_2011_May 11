I&#x27;d first watched this many, many years ago as a teenager and thanks to
Film Four, I was reacquainted with it tonight. Of course, it isn&#x27;t as
funny as I remember but that&#x27;s the thing with these spoofs - with the
large number of gags on screen, there should be something to make you
laugh. And sure enough, &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; does have several moments to make
it worth your while. But due to its pedigree with classics like
&#x22;Airplane!&#x22; and &#x22;The Naked Gun&#x22;, it does suffer by comparison. Luckily,
it isn&#x27;t as bad as recent spoofs like &#x22;Meet The Spartans&#x22; so the
chances are, you&#x27;ll enjoy this.<br /><br />Before finding the benefits of a web-cam and Tiger Blood, Charlie Sheen
used to be an actor. Here he is as Topper Harley, the US Air Force&#x27;s
best pilot recruited back into the fold by Lt. Commander Block (Kevin
Dunn) to assist in a top secret mission to destroy a nuclear weapons
facility. But Topper has baggage - his father was an equally talented
loose cannon, responsible for the death of one of his colleagues which
is something Topper feels he is bound to repeat. But feuding with
fellow pilot Lt. Gregory (Cary Elwes), Topper begins to fall for his
therapist Ramada Thompson (Valeria Golino). But will his feelings wreck
the mission or is it the underhand attempts at sabotage that may cost
the lives of the team? <br /><br />Like most spoofs, there is a machine-gun regularity to the gags whether
there are spoken or visual. Sadly, not all of them hit the mark. There
isn&#x27;t a sense that you can&#x27;t take your eyes and ears off the screen
like you get with &#x22;Airplane!&#x22; where a momentary lapse in concentration
means you miss some hilarity. Another issue I have is that the funniest
actor on screen, by some margin, is Lloyd Bridges as the insane Admiral
Benson. Giving the late Leslie Nielsen a run for his money is no easy
feat but Bridges perfectly captures the straight-faced lunacy that the
spoof genre requires. Sheen, Elwes and Golino simply can&#x27;t match him
but this movie still has enough to carry it through.<br /><br />Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older now but &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; isn&#x27;t as good as I
remember. The jokes aren&#x27;t as funny and the visual gags seem a little
unimaginative but there are still some moments to enjoy. I also like
the fact that it tries to spoof &#x22;Top Gun&#x22; which, if we&#x27;re honest about
it, kinda ran like a parody anywhere. Despite its age, &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22;
remains a comedy that most fans of spoofs will enjoy. It&#x27;s no classic
but considering how most spoofs these days are about as funny as a
fifty mile hike, it remains a strangely amusing spoof of almost any
military action flick you could mention. And if you&#x27;re too young to
have watched this the first time around then maybe it will do you some
good to see Sheen before he became a rock god from Mars with Adonis
DNA. This film is winning but isn&#x27;t it an open goal anyway?
