I&#39;m not sure why, but I guess I was interested in seeing the first Hot
Shots since my mom only has the sequel and I noticed the movie in
Blockbuster, I also love Charlie Sheen in comedies, he works so well in
spoofs. Not to mention all in all, I do love spoofs, most work for me.
It&#39;s just the kind comedy that I like. Hot Shots! proved itself to be a
worthy spoof that is more than worth watching. It spoofs Top Gun, An
Officer and a Gentleman, 9 1/2 Weeks, Gone with the Wind, Rocky, among
many other movies.<br /><br />Topper is a pilot who is wanted back in the navy and falls for a woman,
but he has an edge is considered a rebel. Cary Elwes gives him a hard
time constantly, especially since his father caused Cary&#39;s father to
have a freak plane accident. Cary is also in love with Topper&#39;s woman
and wants revenge.<br /><br />Hot Shots is a great comedy that I have to admit is a guilty pleasure,
but it has so much that most comedies lack now a days. It&#39;s just a fun
innocent movie that deserves a little bit of a higher rating. Charlie
Sheen rocks in comedies, although they have destroyed my new favorite
guilty pleasure, 9 1/2 Weeks, it&#39;s all good.<br /><br />7/10
