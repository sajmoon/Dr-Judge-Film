the movie hot shots is obviously a broad comedy.you really have to look
at the big picture to understand its genius.it&#39;s sort of like the monty
python gang doing their take on hamlet and playing it straight.that&#39;s
the genius of hotshots,that the actors play it as if they too were
doing hamlet.of course there are several funny bits contained in the
movie,and two sequences which are absolutely hysterical.but it is the
intentional over the top acting that really makes this movie.i suspect
they may have had to do numerous takes for many scenes, because the
actors could not keep a straight face.the dialogue is brilliant in this
movie and delivered perfectly deadpan every time.and of course there is
also some physical comedy,which doesn&#39;t hurt.this was a much more
enjoyable movie than the naked gun series. i also must mention lloyd
bridges who played a very important,and very dimwitted admiral.there
are many absurd scenes which are brilliantly overacted.this is a fast
paced movie, which kept me interested to the very end. 6.75*
