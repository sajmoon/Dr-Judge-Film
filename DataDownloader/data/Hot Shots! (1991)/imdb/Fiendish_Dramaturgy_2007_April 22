This is probably one of the better spoofs/parodies today. In my
opinion, while it doesn&#39;t come close to Blazing Saddles, Young
Frankenstein, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, or Spaceballs, it does rank
with the Naked Gun and Airport movies.<br /><br />It is not intelligent, but it is plain stupid fun. Turn off your
intelligence, leave your common sense and thinking cap at the door, and
just enjoy. It is quite mindless fun, and holds nothing Top Gun to be
sacred. I find that a plus.<br /><br />If you like satire, this is well worth your time, and rates a 7.6/10
from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
