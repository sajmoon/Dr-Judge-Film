The movie is full with very, very stupid scene&#x27;s that are funny at the
same time which makes this movie in a way irresistible to watch.<br /><br />The story is just a lame excuse to make a movie full with jokes. So
Basically the story serves no purpose at all and it are the jokes and
the jokes only that make the movie. Some of the jokes are really lame
and stupid and some of the jokes are so lame and stupid that they are
actually funny. The humor is typical Jim Abrahams like and a must see
for his fans and fans of Leslie Nielsen movies.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this but Charlie Sheen is unfortunately no
Leslie Nielsen. He just is not the greatest comical talent I have seen.
Cary Elwes however does surprising good and Lloyd Bridges is simply
hilarious, I have to admit that I laughed at nearly every scene with
him in it.<br /><br />Not the best comedy of all time but funny enough to watch over and over
again.<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
