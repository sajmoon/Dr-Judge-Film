this is one of the greatest comedy spoofs of all time in my opinion.
you got LLoyd Bridges in it, Charlie Sheen, just to name a few.. there
are numerous sight gags to send you laughing, lots and lots of slick
one liners, too many to list here, many many funny moments as this
movie parodies such as Top Gun and a few others,, spawned a sequel as
well 2 years later. I spent the whole time laughing my butt off,, you
really can&#39;t compare the two movies,, as the sequel spoofs other
popular movies as well. Charlie Sheen does very well in his role as
Topper Harley ace pilot. you got characters like Dead Meat , and
Washout which make the film even more funnier,, there are a few star
cameos as well,, look for them,, overall this movie will have you
laughing very hard i know it did for me.
