2008_July 7 
Never really watched Top Gun and that is the movie this one takes the
most shots at. Charlie Sheen is in the lead role here and he is very
funny and good...I always think he is one of the funnier actors out
there. Jon Cryer whom Charlie costars in two and a half men is also
great in this one and Lloyd Bridges is right at home in a spoof movie.
I also like Cary Elwes. The plot has a man recruiting the best pilots
around, he recruits Topper Harley out of an Indian reservation and
before you know it you are meeting the recruits and their fates in the
case of &quot;Dead Meat&quot; who just has a wonderful family and everything is
going right for. You of course have the meeting with the sexy lady that
ends up with a rather bizarre love scene ala Nine and a Half Weeks
involving foods. Still Lloyd Bridges takes the cake as the funniest guy
in the movie as the man has had quite a few operations. This movie is a
spoof though, so along with all the funny things going on, there are
some dud jokes as well. This is also the type of spoof where it is
dependent on you having seen the films it parodies for maximum effect.
