&#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is one of those movies that make fun of other movies or in
this movie&#x27;s case, just one, &#x27;Top Gun&#x27;. Parodies are always welcomed by
the masses, they are watchable to viewers of any age, but in the end
they are just for laughs and nothing more. &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; has those same
characteristics of any parodies that came before and after it, although
for me this movie was a bit more...<br /><br />And maybe that&#x27;s because i never really liked &#x27;Top Gun&#x27; in the first
place, and all these jokes that are made in &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27;, and that
revolve around not only the main events in &#x27;Top Gun&#x27;, but almost EVERY
event, are very funny and likable, they will maybe make you realize:
&#x22;Oh my god, this is so right, all flaws and unrealistic things that
were made in &#x27;Top Gun&#x27; are shown here in a hilarious way of making fun
of &#x27;Top Gun&#x27;&#x22;. That&#x27;s the main thing i like about this movie, these
jokes aren&#x27;t so funny if you didn&#x27;t watch the &#x27;Top Gun&#x27;, but if you
did, and you don&#x27;t consider it to be one of your favorite movies, then
you will think that &#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is quite funny and entertaining.
Charlie Sheen sets a whole new meaning to an expression &#x22;cocky slick&#x22;,
he makes most of the jokes and provides the biggest laughs to the
audience. Except for &#x27;Top Gun&#x27; stuff, this movie also contains minor
parodies on other movies (e.g. &#x27;Rocky&#x27;). <br /><br />&#x27;Hot Shots!&#x27; is one of those movies with which you just can&#x27;t miss. You
will be satisfied on most of the levels after seeing it and you surely
won&#x27;t think of it as a garbage, in fact it is more likely you think of
it as one of the best parodies and rate it even higher than i did.
