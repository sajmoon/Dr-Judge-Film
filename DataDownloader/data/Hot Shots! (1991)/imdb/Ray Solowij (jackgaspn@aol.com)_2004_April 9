2004_April 9 

I grew up watching this movie over and over and over and over again.
Later
I'd watch the Naked Gun Trilogy and then Airplane.  As I grew older still,
I'd
allways pay homoge to the minds who brought us such films, and violently
cursed out today's corny comedies such as The New Guy.  &quot;Why can't there
great comedies like HOTSHOTS, Airplane, the Naked Guns!?&quot; I'd say.
&quot;That's
real comedy!&quot;<br /><br />Then one day I found out that those movies, including Kentucky Fried
Movie
and TOP SECRET were by the same men, in different multiples:  David
Zucker,
Jim Abrahams &amp; Jerry Zucker... my idols.  It's becuase of those men and
films
that I've found where I belong in life.  Laughing.  If it wasn't for that,
I'd probably
be some fat piece of SHlT little emo kid, and for that I thank Zucker
Abrahams &amp;
Zucker from the top of my heart.  More than Jesus.
