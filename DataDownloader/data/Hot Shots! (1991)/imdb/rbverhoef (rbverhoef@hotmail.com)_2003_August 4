'Hot Shots!' is one of the more funny silly movies. The whole movie is
one
big 'Top Gun'-spoof with Charlie Sheen in the Tom Cruise-part. For a
goofy
movie like this Charlie Sheen has the perfect face. Some of the jokes try
too hard to get a laugh, but a lot of them work quite good.<br /><br />Consider this movie is from Jim Abrahams, one of the directors from
'Airplane!' and 'Top Secret!', and you know you have a very funny movie
here. You have to be in the mood, but if you can enjoy other movies in
this
genre you will definitely like this one!
