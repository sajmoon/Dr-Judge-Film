This movie contains some good sight gags plus the talents of Lloyd
Bridges and Charlie Sheen, but it lacks the vitality and great script
of 'Airplane'.<br /><br />Still, it's good fun for the most part and I always find something new
to laugh at each time I view it. The special effects are very ingenious
as well and it's often pretty difficult to tell what's real and what's
a model.<br /><br />Lloyd Bridges, though, is the standout here; he's just so outrageously
funny and certainly gets the best lines. He's even funnier in the
so-called sequel.
