I found the film to be very funny.  Whilst most gags are just smile-worthy,
there are a few that are the laugh-out-loud type.<br /><br />It takes of (mainly) Top Gun, and bits of other films such as Superman, Gone
with the wind and Cocktail.<br /><br />Not quite as good as The Naked Gun trilogy, but certainly as good as the
Airplane films.<br /><br />Charlie Sheen shows that he can play comedy films very
well.<br /><br />Its a bit jumpy in a few places, but that could have been editing due to
showing on TV
