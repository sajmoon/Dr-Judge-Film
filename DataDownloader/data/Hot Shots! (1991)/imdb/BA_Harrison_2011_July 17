2011_July 17 
Having recently watched the entire god-awful Scary Movie series over
four successive evenings, I vowed to do my chuckle muscles a favour and
reacquaint myself with some of the genuinely hilarious &#x27;send-ups&#x27; from
my youth; so why the hell did I sit down and re-watch Hot Shots, which,
although a slight improvement over the Wayans Brothers/David Zucker
horror comedies, is far from a side-splitting classic? Most likely
because I remember it as being funnier than it actually is, or maybe I
was just confusing it with Part Deux.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, seeing the film again has done little to restore
my love for the spoof genre, being a very hit and miss affair that
primarily lampoons 80s blockbuster Top Gun, but also throws in random
references to other films along the way. A few of the gags are funny (I
enjoyed the silly repeat joke with the chihuahua), but the greater
percentage fall flat on their face; given how rapid-fire the jokes are,
that&#x27;s an awful lots of groans over 84 minutes.<br /><br />I guess I&#x27;m going to have to go even further back through the annals of
comedy to find a really good parody; I just hope that Airplane, Top
Secret and The Naked Gun are actually as good as I think they are.
