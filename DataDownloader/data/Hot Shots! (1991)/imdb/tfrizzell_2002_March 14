&quot;Hot Shots!&quot; is not a total loss. There are some hilarious moments, but as
a
whole the film is only watchable. &quot;Top Gun&quot; and dozens of other films are
made fun of in this would-be laugh-fest. Charlie Sheen does well with his
tongue-in-cheek role. As a matter of fact most in the film do pretty well,
but there are far too many misfires at laughs to make &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; the
success it could have been. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
