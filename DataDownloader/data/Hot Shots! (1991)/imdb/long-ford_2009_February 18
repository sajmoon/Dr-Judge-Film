This is a weak spoof best watched if you have nothing else to do. It
wants to be a parody of &#39;Top Gun&#39; but it&#39;s difficult to spoof something
that&#39;s already (unintentionally) campy. Anyway, it still might have
worked as there&#39;s some funny material in the script. However the
editing is very poor. Most of the jokes are stretched so long that
there&#39;s little humor left. What should have been breezy fun appears
labored instead. Both Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes are in good form but
can&#39;t rise above the material. The sequel &#39;Hot Shots! Part Deux&#39; was
far funnier in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall 3/10
