Kristen Wig&#x27;s Bridesmates impresses with whacky incidents and uncommon
characters making each scene worthy to watch making you laugh hard. The
novelty of the universal theme of jealousy-friendship triangle is
conveyed very well on screen. Due to that, it becomes very easily
relatable to watch right from the first act of the film.<br /><br />The big ensemble of cast, notably Kristen and Melissa impress with
splendid performances.<br /><br />The dialogues are crisp, funny but crude to a great extent but
eventually works at most instances. However the crude exhaustive
conversations at some scenes could stand out to be quite odd. At the
downside the last act becomes shockingly clich&#xE9; and ends like a typical
chick flick.<br /><br />But In overall a great entertaining, stress reliever.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10
