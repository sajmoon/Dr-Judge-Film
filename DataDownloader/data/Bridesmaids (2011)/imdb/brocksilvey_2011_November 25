A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of
the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given
better material to work with.<br /><br />When Wiig and her &#x22;Saturday Night Live&#x22; fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph,
are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder
why someone didn&#x27;t think to give these two a buddy comedy along the
lines of &#x22;Baby Mama.&#x22; But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and
the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the
character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before
the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies
must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy
ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig&#x27;s character endures
becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig&#x27;s frantic efforts to
wring comedy out of situations that don&#x27;t lend themselves much to
laughs.<br /><br />Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and
there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth
sitting through.<br /><br />Grade: B
