This is going to be short and sweet as there are a lot of reviews that
go into really good detail.<br /><br />Here is the thing, if you don&#x27;t have a sense of humor or don&#x27;t like
crude humor, don&#x27;t see this movie. Some of the reviews on here are just
ridiculous. &#x22;It wasn&#x27;t what I expected from the previews&#x22;. Really? It
was EXACTLY what I thought it was going to be from the previews. Do you
not watch SNL? What previews were you watching? I thought the movie was
really funny and the only reason I saw it was because I lost a bet with
my wife (I wanted to see X-men: First Class).<br /><br />I love Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph on SNL so I knew they were funny
but I didn&#x27;t know they could act as well. The chemistry between the two
of them really makes the movie for me. Maybe because they have spent so
many years together on SNL or maybe they really are best friends but
you really believe that the two of them are best friends. The dialog
between the two just seems real.<br /><br />So is short, this humor is not for everyone but to think it is any
different than the previews is just moronic.<br /><br />Good Movie. Go see it!
