This movie was absolutely hilarious! Funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen in years! <br /><br />And don&#x27;t get me wrong, the storyline and such were great, but Kristen
Wiig just MADE the movie. Definitely not the stereotype/typical actress
in a &#x27;female&#x27; comedy. It wasn&#x27;t the typical romantic comedy and that&#x27;s
why men should see it too (although more women than men will enjoy the
movie because we can relate more to certain scenes..?).<br /><br />Please don&#x27;t compare it with &#x27;The Hangover&#x27;. Just because it involves a
wedding and it&#x27;s from the perspective of women, doesn&#x27;t make it the
&#x27;female hangover&#x27;. This is a different style. People will watch the
movie with certain expectations/prejudices if u compare it with another
movie.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews for this movie. The one&#x27;s that gave
them, are they mostly guys? If yes: then go watch Shoot &#x27;Em Up again
and sush! ;)<br /><br />The one thing that&#x27;s bad about the movie is the title, because it makes
you think that it&#x27;s another lame romantic comedy with only women in the
lead role.<br /><br />Oh, and is it me or is there a link with Little Britain (besides Matt
Lucas of course)? &#x22;Annie, it&#x27;s Rita..&#x22;<br /><br />:)
