Kristen Wiig is without a doubt one of the best members of the Saturday
Night Live cast. She&#x27;s had some moderate success in movies so far with
supporting roles in Paul, Whip It, and a very small role in the comedy
Date Night. I&#x27;ve been wanting to see her get a starring role for quite
sometime now, but does it end up being good or not? In Bridesmaids,
Annie (Kristen Wiig) is picked to be the maid of honor by her best
friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Annie and Lillian have been best friends
since they were young and Annie, getting to be her best friends maid of
honor, should be lots of fun and a time to make some great memories
right? Wrong. Once Annie gets introduced to another member of the
bridal party Helen (Rose Byrne), all hell breaks loose between them. We
get the two of them bickering throughout the majority of the movie and
trying to one up each other to show Lillian how much better they are
than one another. Along for the ride is the rest of the bridal party
played by the likes of Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper from The
Office, and Melissa McCarthy, who ends up stealing the entire movie.<br /><br />There is also a subplot involving Annie and a police officer played by
Chris O&#x27;Dowd. While a few of the scenes between them feel unnecessary,
O&#x27;Dowd comes off as sweet and funny in the nice guy role. Another
subplot involves Mad Men&#x27;s Jon Hamm but he feels underused and
surprisingly isn&#x27;t very funny in his role. One problem that I have with
this movie is the back and forth with Wiig and Byrne. While both women
are good in their roles the scenes where they try to one up each other
just come off as annoying and make their characters, especially
Bryne&#x27;s, unlikeable.<br /><br />All in all, the movie ends up being quite hilarious overall. Wiig shows
that she can be a leading lady in a comedy. Maya Rudolph continues to
show off her comedic chops time and time again and we get a breakout
star in Melissa McCarthy.<br /><br />Other than a scene involving gross-out humor the movie is a funny,
raunchy, and sometimes sweet comedy that pretty much all women, and
even a good bit of men are sure, to enjoy.<br /><br />Rating: 7.5/10
