This movie is one of a kind--the only screamingly funny comedy which
also makes you really care about its characters. It&#x27;s one of the best
comedies in the history of movies, and certainly the best comedy of the
last decade...and beyond.<br /><br />How often has a movie made you fall out of your chair with laughter and
then, not ten seconds later, tugged at your heartstrings? This great
film has that effect. <br /><br />Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy deserve starring and supporting
Oscars respectively, and Wiig deserves a writing award to boot. The
whole cast, from Rose Byrne to Chris O&#x27;Dowd to Maya Rudolph to Jon
Hamm, deserves outspoken praise. The movie is quite indescribably
wonderful.
