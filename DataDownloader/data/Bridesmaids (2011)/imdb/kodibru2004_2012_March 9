At the start of Bridemaids, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect besides comedy
only because several friends told me about the movie , so I decided to
give it a try. The movie is about a group of ladies involved in their
friend wedding. Basically, the two bridesmaids fought for the most
attention from the bride.The movie is clearly for females, which
throughout the whole movie they did the craziest but funniest things
ever. My favorite part of the movie is when they were at the bridal
shop looking at gowns and all of a sudden everyone stomach turned, this
part had me crying laughing. I definitely want to see another movie
similar to this one in the near future with all females. Bridemaids is
definitely a must see.........
