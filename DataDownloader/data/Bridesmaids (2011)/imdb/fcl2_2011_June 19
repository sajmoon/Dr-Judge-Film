Having read the other reviews - I was wondering if I had seen the same
film!! Went with 3 girlfriends - and all 4 of us found this film
absolute rubbish!! One girlfriend said she couldn&#x27;t stand it and left
around 30 minutes. I thought I would give it a bit more time, but when
the remaining 2 also said they couldn&#x27;t stand it, I concurred, and we
all left. So no - we could not give a review of ALL the film. We gave
it 48 minutes - that was all be could tolerate. And believe me, our
little group likes a good laugh and have enjoyed some great funny
films. This is NOT one of them. Sorry - but I HATED this film - just
awful
