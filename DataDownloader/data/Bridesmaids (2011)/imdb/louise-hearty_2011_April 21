What a great movie. I laughed so hard. I went to the screening last
night, so I saw the uncut, unrated version. The theatre was packed and
everyone from the theatre, talking after the movie in the lobby all
seemed to love it and be laughing so hard retelling parts of the story.
So many funny parts. My friend liked the story, but didn&#x27;t like some of
the crude parts. The 2 hours flew by - you know that&#x27;s a great movie.
The acting was great and there were some surprise band appearances.
While some of the actions were a bit on the dramatic side, they were
still extremely funny. Great acting by everyone in the movie. Gotta
love the airplane scene. I was retelling the scene at work today and
everyone was laughing just hearing about it. I think this movie will go
far and it&#x27;s one I want to watch again, right now!
