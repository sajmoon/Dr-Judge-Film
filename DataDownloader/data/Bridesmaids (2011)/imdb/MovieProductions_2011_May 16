***1/2 out of (****)<br /><br />There&#x27;s me in the box office. A heterosexual male purchasing his ticket
to see a fluffy, women-empowerment production while the lady at the
counter scoffs as she advertently prints out the tickets. I choose my
seat, preferably the middle row, with my large buttered popcorn and a
behemoth size of my choosing of Diet Coke. Ten minutes into the movie,
I already have to use the restroom. And no, it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t because of the
Diet Coke, the excessive popcorn, or that I have diarrhea. It&#x27;s because
I was laughing so hard my knees started to buckle, my face started to
turn sweaty, and I couldn&#x27;t control an ounce of my body. I seriously
think &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen in a decade. Never
has a comedy been this good at tossing punchlines out of the sky. <br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; revolves around Annie (Wigg) who is chosen to be
Lillian&#x27;s made of honor (Rudolph). However, things aren&#x27;t so easy when
she got used by her ex-boyfriend, her cake bakery got shut down, and
Lillian&#x27;s close friend Helen (Bryne) is trying to steal the pedestal of
friendship.<br /><br />First of all, let me just say, the acting is just fantastic. Literally
every performance is pitch- perfect, and I think not one ounce of
improvement is needed. Kristen Wigg seriously is one of the funniest
female comedians, and she make jokes out of a phone book and still be
hilarious. However, my favorite has to be, hands down Melissa McCarthy.
I kid you not, every time she was on screen, my laugh-o-meter
skyrocket, my heart strings were tugged at, and I sat there knowing I
was going to have a great time. Furthermore, I know I&#x27;ve said this like
a thousand times, but the movie is HILARIOUS. I can&#x27;t stress it enough.
Guy, girl, homo, hetero, bi, African American, Asian, Caucasian. It
doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, you will laugh. <br /><br />And lastly, this movie has definite rewatchability. After you see it,
you&#x27;ll want to jump back in line and see it at least two more times. I
know I wanted to, and probably will. <br /><br />All in all, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; may be lengthy, but dammit, it is the
funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen all year. With top notch performances, a
reasonable pace, and witty/clever humor, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is one of the
best movies of the year and reasonably so.
