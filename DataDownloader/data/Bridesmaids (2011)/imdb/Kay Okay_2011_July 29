It turns out I&#x27;m a girl. I did not get the hype over The Hangover at
all, and I laugh at a lot of anything and everything. I just found it
dull, predictable, and completely forgettable. I was truly reluctant to
go see Bridesmaids because it was so hyped as the woman&#x27;s Hangover.
Ugh. Furthermore, my own bridesmaiding memories are neither endearing
nor funny. I broke down though, having gone through everything else I
wanted to see in the last several months, and went. What a wonderful
surprise. <br /><br />I liked that it wasn&#x27;t one clich&#xE9; laugh after another, but very genuine
huge laughs in the right places. Loved that there was an actual plot to
it that was pretty real in amongst the escapades that were over the top
for the laughs. If this is the girly version of the current comedies,
maybe I am a girl after all. <br /><br />** SPOILER ** My only criticism is maybe just a preference. I knew from
right after girl met boy that boy will catch girl in the end. Too
predictable / overdone. Not sure how I&#x27;d change that because I am also
tired of the All Men Are Jerks themes in some &#x27;women&#x27;s&#x27; comedies, and
Rhodes served to show us a decent guy who was not a pushover. Will have
to think about what else can be done to prevent that predictability. <br /><br />** end SPOILER **<br /><br />Last comment. Love that they all looked like real people and all
gorgeous.
