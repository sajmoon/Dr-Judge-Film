I want to start off by saying this is a good movie and I would
recommend it to others. I just read all of these glowing reviews and I
must have had some really high expectations. I wasn&#x27;t blown away like
all of these other people were. I saw it with my girlfriend. We both
laughed and had a great time. After it was over, we moved on though. We
weren&#x27;t quoting the movie or talking about it for hours.<br /><br />The character development was great. I enjoyed the originality of the
jokes and situations the characters were placed in. For the most part,
it wasn&#x27;t stupidly predictable, although there were parts where I knew
what would happen later in the movie.<br /><br />This is a fun, witty comedy. I think it was geared toward the female
audience. (I&#x27;m male) While I did get some really good laughs, I could
tell some jokes were just not meant for me. I just sat there, rolling
my eyes, like I was sitting at some sort of girl slumber party that I
wasn&#x27;t invited to. The older, female audience was practically wetting
its pants, however. Maybe they&#x27;re just not used to the crude,
in-your-face humor, reminiscent of so many &#x22;guy&#x22; movies just like this.<br /><br />There were some scenes that went wayyy too long. OK, I get it, it is an
awkward moment, lets move on..... There&#x27;s no reason to waste 10 minutes
of a movie to stress how awkward a moment is. And of course, there HAD
to be a musical moment where everyone breaks into song and dance
together, as if they all got together the day before and rehearsed.
This single moment turned this movie into a &#x22;chick-flick&#x22; for me,
sorry.<br /><br />On a more positive note, the acting was great! My favorite
character/actress was the groom&#x27;s sister! By far! Kudos! Sorry, I don&#x27;t
know anyone&#x27;s real name. Seriously, its far too much to keep track of.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a female, go see this movie. If you&#x27;re a guy who wants to see
a movie with a girl, you could do much much worse than Bridesmaids. I
did enjoy myself, and left with a smile on my face. The completely
packed theater was justified. I just didn&#x27;t think it was quite as good
as the other reviews are saying. I was expecting to see a movie that
we&#x27;ll be watching and re-watching for years, judging by what others
said. If my girlfriend gets it on Blue-ray, and its a rainy day
outside, I&#x27;d gladly watch it with her again. I just won&#x27;t go out of my
way.<br /><br />All-in-all, I&#x27;d recommend this movie. I think most people should see
it, and you can judge for yourself what you think of it. I don&#x27;t want
to scare anyone away because it was good. Just not THAT good (in my
opinion).
