My wife and I recently watched this movie with great expectations of a
laugh filled presentation and boy were we disappointed! This movie is
probably one of the most depressing attempts, I&#x27;ve seen for humor in
years. I see nothing funny in witnessing public displays of crude
behavior, especially from women! I kept thinking, as I watched this
movie it must be going to get better, it never did and when it finally
ended I couldn&#x27;t believe that anyone would think that this might be
construed as a comedy! I was relieved to see that the academy award
nominee, rightfully did not win for her awful performance. Good funny
movies are a joy to watch in today&#x27;s depressing economy, this movie was
just plain awful!
