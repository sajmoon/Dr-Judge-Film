I went to see this film when it first came out with six other girls and
I was surprised at just how funny this film was! I expected it to be
like every other chick flick. <br /><br />I know lots of people claim this is the female &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; but it is
so much better. The acting is great, the relationships between all of
the characters are so natural you can almost relate to them. Rose Byrne
was especially good, her portrayal of Helen was spot on, with the fake
smiles and laughs. Kirsten Wiig and Maya Rudolph are known to be good
friends and it is shown greatly in this film. Melissa McCarthy does
steal the show here and fully deserves her Oscar nomination - she&#x27;s
hilarious. You almost wish you knew someone like her because she
provides over half of the films&#x27; comedy.<br /><br />I guess the plot outline is fairly basic and predictable but you hardly
notice it because the humour in this film shines through in nearly
every scene. <br /><br />Overall, if you have not seen this, watch it - it will make you laugh
all the way through. It&#x27;s brilliant because it&#x27;s a chick flick with
harsh language, vulgarity and cringe-worthy circumstances which are
sadly rare in this genre of film which is often considered trash -
&#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; is what chick flicks should be like.
