Not normally a fan of these kind of films, not exactly aimed at the
&#x27;bloke&#x27; market this. Girls will love it, of course, and guys... will
still find it funny.<br /><br />All the things i hate are still there, everythings over the top, poor
jokes, a wedding that doesn&#x27;t go to plan... etc... but then there are
some very funny moments the whole way through too.<br /><br />One thing i&#x27;ll never understand about these kinds of film however, is
what they spend over $30mil on! But they&#x27;ll always get there money
back.<br /><br />Basiccly, if your girlfriend does drag you along to see this film,
you&#x27;ll pretend you didn&#x27;t like it, and tell her it was lame, but you&#x27;ll
laugh just as much as she will.
