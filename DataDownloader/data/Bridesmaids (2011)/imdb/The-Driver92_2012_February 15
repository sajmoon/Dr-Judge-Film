This movie is just plain awesome. 3 stars, people? Really? I honestly
don&#x27;t understand how folks can rank a movie like this, which is
obviously well crafted, even if you may not like the brand of humor, a
low rating and then give a piece of crap like &#x22;What&#x27;s Your Number&#x22; a
high one. The script, partially by Kirsten Wiig is great here; in some
respects your standard comedy plot that you can see coming from a mile
away, but in other respects very daring (the main character has to deal
with a bout of depression in the middle of the movie, for instance).
The directing is by one of the co-writers of the Freaks and Geeks TV
show who has also been in the Judd Apatow &#x22;stable&#x22;, so that&#x27;s quality,
too.<br /><br />But what really, really sets this movie apart are the characters. Very
rarely does a guy- comedy have a set of characters as nuanced and funny
as this one - off the top of my head, I can think of some Apatow/Apatow
family movies that reach this: Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the first
Hangover movie, and Superbad, for three. But aside from those, which
are fantastic in their own right, don&#x27;t get me wrong, you have to go
back to some of the great comedies of all time for this level of
characterization: American Pie, There&#x27;s Something About Mary, and Annie
Hall are some that come to mind here. It&#x27;s a wonderful combination of
script and actor that gets these roles just exactly right. Maya Rudolph
is funny and raunchy without losing her cool-person aura as the
bride-to-be, Wendi McClendon-Covey (of Reno 911 fame) is hilarious as
the foul-mouthed housewife, and Melissa McCarthy... oh man, Melissa
McCarthy. I always liked her in Gilmore Girls but who knew she could
not only play off the female Zach Galifinakis role but do it as well as
old Zach could? Every single scene she&#x27;s in elicits a belly laugh.<br /><br />So I don&#x27;t want to say that if you dislike the movie you are probably
racist against women, but you are. No, seriously, screw what other
people say about this. If you&#x27;re a guy and you like the Judd Apatow
series, you will like this movie as well. If you&#x27;re a girl and wished
those movies would have more chicks sharting in them, you will like it
as well. If you are a member of the Moral Majority... why are you
reading reviews of Bridesmaids in the first place? I&#x27;m pretty sure
that&#x27;s a sin.
