Most chick flick comedies are usually unwanted by many people because
of their childish and mostly caricatured humor and their escapist love
stories. But when Apatow and Paul Feig tries to save this genre, it&#x27;s
still has its chick flickness but it has a realistic and full of heart
storyline. The film has its raunchiness. It&#x27;s hilarious throughout.
Bridesmaids must be the best comedy movie of the year so far, and one
of the funniest chick flick comedies ever.<br /><br />First goes to the actors. Kristen Wiig&#x27;s is a brilliant comedian. Her
craziness and charisma really made the show aside from the humor. Maya
Rudolph gives a lot of heart to her role. Melissa McCarthy has the best
parts and she nearly steals the show. The rest of the cast did a great
job to this film.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is not as generic as the other female comedies existing.
The story isn&#x27;t really that original but it portrays in a realistic
way. Not quite realistic but it&#x27;s not an escapist love story where the
main girl is perfect human being but a loser. Aside from the love story
plot, the parts when she is being jealous to her best friend&#x27;s new
friend. There&#x27;s mixed emotions and comedy to those scenes. Paul Feig
knows how to put humor plus heart perfectly in a comedy film.<br /><br />The humor is written by clever writers even the star of this film. What
we expect to this film, it&#x27;s hilarious throughout. The raunchy humor
and some toilet humor mixed with heartfelt emotions and awkwardness.
It&#x27;s (obviously) one of the merits of this film.<br /><br />Most people say this film is like The Hangover but with female cast.
The Hangover is more clever but this one is more hilarious and more
heart than you expect. The performances plus the hilarious humor, this
film is easily one of the funniest female comedies ever although it&#x27;s
unnecessarily long but it&#x27;s undeniably enjoyable(even if you&#x27;re a guy).
