There were no other good movies running, so she insisted we go and
watch this one. I was standing in the queue for the ticket and I was
thinking, am I the only guy around here? I saw girls all around me,
horrible sight.<br /><br />Once I got in, I was planning to take a short nap, thinking its a
typical chick flick , but it turned out to be pretty hilarious, some of
the scenes were pretty funny. It had a &#x22;girl&#x22; kinda thing in it, but
still some of the scenes impressed me. Overall good enjoyment for the
money.<br /><br />I thought it was a bit too long, but still I enjoyed this movie. I will
recommend this movie to people who think its a pure chick flick kinda
movie, because its not, its got some decent scenes in it which really
makes you laugh.<br /><br />If you want a good laugh then go for it.
