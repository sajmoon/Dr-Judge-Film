Just watched this hilarious and touching comedy with my movie
theatre-working friend which stars current SNLer Kristen Wiig today.
She also co-wrote and co-produced it. She plays Annie, a failed bakery
chef who currently works at a jewelry shop whose best friend-played by
her former SNL castmate Maya Rudolph-is getting married. This friend is
now chums with someone in her new circle who has a little friction with
Annie. I&#x27;ll just stop there and just say that any comparisons with The
Hangover are fine as there are some gross-out humor that can be both
funny and maybe a little too much for some tastes. Still, the
characterizations and relationships between are real enough that one
does care for them. And besides Wiig and Rudolph, there&#x27;s plenty of
funny stuff from the supporting cast with the likes of Ellie Kemper of
&#x22;The Office&#x22;, Melissa McCarthy currently of &#x22;Mike &#x26; Molly&#x22;, and Jon
Hamm of &#x22;Mad Men&#x22; as a jerk of a boyfriend of Annie. In addition, a
couple of former SNLers in Nancy Walls (Mrs. Steve Carell) and Melanie
Hutsell also appear in a screamingly funny tennis match (though I only
recognized the latter in the movie). So on that note, I highly
recommend Bridesmaids. P.S. There&#x27;s an appearance by the Maya
character&#x27;s favorite group that was a nice surprise especially with the
song they sang. And this was the late Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s last film role
as Annie&#x27;s mother. Incidentally, she hosted SNL twice during the &#x27;70s.
