As a comedy, to me, this movie just wasn&#x27;t really good or funny enough.
It actually was a pretty awkward movie to watch at times and I just
can&#x27;t understand why it is being liked so much. Oh well, perhaps I
simply need to be a woman to &#x27;get it&#x27;.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was buildup like
a realistic and serious movie, complete with emotions and women trouble
and all but with yet also some truly over-the-top comedy thrown into
it. This just wasn&#x27;t a combination that worked out very good or felt
organic to me. Some of the insane comical situations really seemed out
of place and totally not in tone with any of the rest of the movie.
This especially goes for the movie its gross out moments.<br /><br />It&#x27;s good and all that there is a big and popular comedy for- and by
women for a change but I&#x27;m just incapable of seeing it as a great or
fun one. But like I said, this is probably all because I&#x27;m male and
just can&#x27;t relate to any of the issues being handled in this movie, or
just simply don&#x27;t find them all that interesting or appealing. Yes,
this foremost truly is a chick-flick, so if you are a female, simply
just ignore what I have to say about it, since chances are you are
going to have a totally different opinion- and feeling toward this
movie.<br /><br />But really, the movie as a whole doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that well
written or clever. It&#x27;s of course mostly being predictable and most of
the comical situations feel forced and like they were shoehorned in.
Besides, it seemed so unlikely to me that all of these girls were all
truly friends, since most of the them have very little in common. Some
of the characters are also terribly underwritten and I have no idea why
they were in this movie at all.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not like the actors were bad though. I known lots of people are
always saying bad things about women doing comedy but this movie
definitely shows that females are perfectly capable of handling comedy
material. It of course helps that the movie is written by females. You
could really tell that by basically everything that this movie was
written by females for females. The dialog and story-flow all feel more
natural because of this. I only did wish the comedy was something
better and more natural feeling as well. But again, if you are a
female, chances are you will still end up really liking this movie.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed but then again, this movie clearly wasn&#x27;t
made for me.<br /><br />6/10 <br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
