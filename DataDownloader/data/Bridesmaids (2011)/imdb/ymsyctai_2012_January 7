This movie is what the Hangover movies should have been... funny. I
can&#x27;t recall seeing Kristen Wiig anywhere before this movie but I&#x27;m
going to keep an eye out for her. I never spoil movies in my reviews by
telling you what the movie is about especially when I love the movie.
This movie is a laugh fest from beginning to end. Well written and
never a dull moment. Even though we have an all female cast in here
this isn&#x27;t a chick flick. There is some romance in the film but it is
very minimal and works in the story and isn&#x27;t forced into it just to
have it in there. I heard they&#x27;re planning a sequel to this movie but
without Wiig. I could see that working if it is super well written but
I really think Wiig would be missed. In this movie she basically plays
the sane person that reacts the the madness around her coming from the
other crazy female cast. I guess the only good thing about Hangover is
that is brought these kind of comedies into the mainstream light.<br /><br />GO RENT THIS NOW.
