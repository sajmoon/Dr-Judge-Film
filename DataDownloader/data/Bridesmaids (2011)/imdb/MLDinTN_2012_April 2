I was expecting to laugh a lot and didn&#x27;t laugh once. This movie was
not that funny, I don&#x27;t get why it got so much press as being the
funniest movie of the year. A bunch of F words, don&#x27;t make a movie
funny. Melissa Mccarthy had the best role, but the jokes just didn&#x27;t
make me laugh. Kristen Wiig&#x27;s Annie character was just mean and ugly to
her friends. Plus, the way she treats the guy who likes her like crap,
but he still wants her at the end. I don&#x27;t buy it. Different scenes
seemed like SNL sketches, like Annie doped up on the plane or Annie
breaking all kinds of traffic laws trying to get her guy&#x27;s attention.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Over-hyped, I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth seeing.
