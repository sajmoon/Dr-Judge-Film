My husband and I went to a screening with few expectations because
lately the comedies have been awful. We were very pleasantly surprised!
The three main characters were developed very well and their
relationships were portrayed very believably. Maya and Kristen grew up
together and Maya is getting married. A new friend has taken over,
which upsets Kristen. She is not in a good place at the time and needs
Maya, who is not available like she had been in the past. We haven&#x27;t
laughed out loud so much in a long time, but you do feel Kristen&#x27;s pain
throughout the movie. The bridal salon scene is absolutely hysterical
and people were still talking about it on the way out of the movie.
Don&#x27;t miss this one!
