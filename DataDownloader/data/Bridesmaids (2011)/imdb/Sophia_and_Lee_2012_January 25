There are a handful of recent comedies that have made me laugh out loud
(or LOL) consistently. Thank You for Smoking was a smart one. Get Him
to the Greek was one too - though not as smart. Superbad, Observe and
Report and Role Models are included on the list. Still sitting on the
throne of mirth, for me, is 40 Year Old Virgin. All of these films have
extended scenes that people will talk about for a long time.
Bridesmaids meets the same standard. <br /><br />Of course, it&#x27;s not enough to have just two knockout sequences and
Bridesmaids has a multitude of linked nods, winks and exclamations on
the periphery of larger events that keeps the momentum going. The
characters are often exaggerations of real people than recreations. The
predominant style is &#x22;it&#x27;s funny because it&#x27;s true&#x22;, but taken a step
further for emphasis. If there is a criticism, it is that Judd Apatow&#x27;s
style was imprinted so heavily on some dialogue that the characters
seemed to be channeling his voice and I half expected to see Steve
Carell make a cameo appearance.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t planning on thinking too much before I started watching and
enjoyed the show purely for its laugh content. Since the film doesn&#x27;t
set out do anything but use life&#x27;s frustrations and let-downs for
laughs, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me about analysing the characters
afterwards. Bridesmaids is worth every minute you&#x27;ll use to watch it. I
was chuckling for days.
