Saw this film yesterday at a preview screening, and enjoyed it. Most of
the girls in the screening loved it, whereas the one man was saying at
the end, &#x22;I didn&#x27;t get it!&#x22;... I guess I was somewhere in the middle of
the two opinions. <br /><br />I was hoping for more sass from Rose Byrne. And less vom-com from Sukie
From Gilmore Girls. The comedy is a blend of well-timed mutterings and
over the top cringe moments, but overall Wiig does well, and has great
Meg Ryan-esque hair.<br /><br />As I walked away from the film, what stayed with me most wasn&#x27;t the
comedy, but an overwhelming desire to call some old girlfriends I
hadn&#x27;t spoken to enough recently. Its a great portrayal of female
friendship, and its difficulties (we&#x27;ve all been there in one way or
another), topped by the very genuine-seeming moments of in-jokes
between Wiig and Rudolph. They were definitely the best moments.
