Bridesmaids really is what is seems: a funny, loose, entertaining and
interesting movie with well developed characters that use a simple
story to show the relationship between them and also their personal
crisis, all centered by a woman that is living the worst moments of her
life few days before her best friend&#x27;s wedding.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is being compared to The Hangover (2011) which isn&#x27;t fair,
because this one may seems a chick flick but it&#x27;s not just for having
more important qualities. The Hangover is just a male celebration
without any other interest than just make audience laugh and have fun
with absurd situations involving male culture and clich&#xE9; comedy
situations effectively used.<br /><br />Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, the movie is not absurd. The
female culture is there for sure when talking about marriage crisis and
all that bridesmaids culture, but it&#x27;s just a background story. The
personal dramas, the difficulties to achieve some objectives in life,
relationship crisis between love and friends, the feeling that the
world is conspiring against your wills... all of this is universal and
everyone goes thru it at least one time in life. The movie shows it all
in brilliant small doses without being corny for the effective use of
comedy moments to relieve what would seems melodramatic, also it&#x27;s not
cheesy because there are amazing performances by an ensemble cast that
most of the times use improvised dialogs and moments, making the movie
flows naturally and with no pressures or high intents to be funny.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig shines and gears entire movie, her performance is
stunning. Being or not being based on personal experiences, her
character fits her perfectly. Rose Byrne also have her important
moments and proves one more time that she&#x27;s getting better with each
new work. The other supporting characters are well placed, even some of
them being a little underused.<br /><br />Predictable? Yes, but loved it anyway. It&#x27;s impossible not be
fascinated by so charismatic characters within simple and at the same
time amazing funny and heartfelt moments that never requires more than
great honest performances.<br /><br />As another one said: &#x22;It&#x27;s strong proof that one can make a comedy
about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited.&#x22;
