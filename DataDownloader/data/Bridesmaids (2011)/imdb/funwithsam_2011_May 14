I saw the trailer and previews of this movie and thought it might be
kinda cute. My girlfriend FINALLY had a night off so I suggested we go
see Bridesmaids so we did.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t sure how Kristen Wiig would do as a lead in a movie. I saw her
in Whip It and she was very good in that movie (enjoyed that movie a
lot too!) so I was hoping she could pull it off. Guess what? She did.
The entire cast was very cool. Complimenting each other as far as what
they brought to the group of friends.<br /><br />But the scene stealer of the movie has to be Melissa McCarthy. She
played Megan who was the brother of Maya Rudolph&#x27;s betrothed. This girl
was HILARIOUS. She was the Zack Galifianakas of the movie.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to get into the whole story but if you want a good laugh
(and at times, one that may make you pee yourself), go see this movie.
Enjoy!
