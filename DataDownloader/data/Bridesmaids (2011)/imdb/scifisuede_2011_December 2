I don&#x27;t know why I thought that this film would be one of those dumb
in-your-face explicit comedies that seem to be the trend lately. Maybe
it was the title, which made me think it&#x27;d be about a bunch of drunken
bridesmaids having sex left and right. Maybe it was because the person
who recommended it hasn&#x27;t had the best taste in films. Either way, I
watched it with low expectation - and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It&#x27;s darker and deeper, with well-developed characters. All the
bridesmaids have different backgrounds which result in their having
different characteristics. The protagonist&#x27;s character is well told and
it&#x27;s played really well by Kristen Wiig. We can sympathise with her
&#x27;going down the drain&#x27; life, even when she&#x27;s being weird and crazy.<br /><br />The main event of the film is of course the rivalry between our
protagonist and her best friend&#x27;s NEW best friend, which are funny at
times and frustrating at others. There&#x27;s a good mix of drama and comedy
in the whole storyline, but as the consequence, there are some awkward
moments there as well - some funny parts are not realistic enough
compared to the more serious dramatic parts. But hey, that&#x27;s how life
is - sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry. It&#x27;s still a refreshing
comedy compared to what Hollywood is dishing out these days.
