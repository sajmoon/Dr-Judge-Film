OMG this movie is hilarious!! I&#x27;ve gone back to see it twice just this
past week. SO MUCH FUN!!! The cast is brilliant. I don&#x27;t know how much
of this was improved versus being written but it all feels to organic
and the cast chemistry is fantastic. I laughed so hard that I cried
through most of the movie. It&#x27;s so not a &#x22;Chick Flick.&#x22; IT&#x27;s SOOO MUCH
MORE!<br /><br />The best part of this movie is that it&#x27;s not gender biased. The cast is
mostly female but, they are unapologetically raunchy. Think Sex And The
City meets The Hangover. Judd Apatow just found his next major hit. The
guy is just a comic genius. <br /><br />And it&#x27;s not just the dialogue that&#x27;s funny. The physical comedy and
the scenes are brilliant and perfect. You will only be disappointed if
you don&#x27;t see it.
