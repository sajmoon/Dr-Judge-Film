2011_July 17 
I have seen quite a few movies released this year, some brilliant(Tree
of Life), some great(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2), some
good(On Stranger Tides), some disappointing(Green Lantern) and some
really bad(Battle:Los Angeles). Bridesmaids is one of the brilliant
films I have seen released this year, while there are one or two
moments where the gross-out humour is a little tiresome, I haven&#x27;t seen
anything this funny and this original in a while. The production values
are great, the cinematography is crisp and smooth and the scenery and
fashions are very striking. The soundtrack also brought a smile to my
face, as did the buoyant direction, the original and well-paced story
and especially the sharp and acerbic writing. The characters are
examples of those perhaps that initially you think am I going to like
these characters, but the actors clearly make an effort to give them
personality and likability. Of the talented cast, Kristen Wiig and
Melissa McCarthy stand out, both these actresses are brilliant, but
Rose Byrne and Chris O&#x27;Dowd are also terrific. Overall, a great film
and one of my favourites of the year so far. 9/10 Bethany Cox
