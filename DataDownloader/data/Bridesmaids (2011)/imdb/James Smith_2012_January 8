The acting in this film is excellent; despite the comic and crazy
dialogue, there is a lot of subtlety in the delivery. Lead actress
Kristen Wiig is superb as Annie, the maid of honour, working fluidly
alongside a talented and well directed cast. Interestingly, the only
actors that didn&#x27;t fit for me were Annie&#x27;s English flat mates, Gil and
Brynn (played by Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson), whose inclusion is
baffling - those scenes could easily have been edited out with no
detriment to the final film.<br /><br />Unlike other wedding films, this one has a bit more bite and language -
so a welcome change for a genre that was in danger of being dominated
by slush. An excellent comedy that has a bit of soul and keeps the
laughs coming.
