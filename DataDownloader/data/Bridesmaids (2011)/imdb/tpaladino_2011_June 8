I had heard rave reviews about this film, and was genuinely excited to
see it. The trailers were great, and the premise seemed to be very
funny; the anti-chick-flick, but done in a way that both sexes could
enjoy. <br /><br />It was NOT, however, the film that the trailers made it out to be--
which is to say, &#x27;The Hangover&#x27;, except with a female cast. You know; a
motley crew of misfit bridesmaids get increasingly deeper into raunchy
and improbable situations, and hilarity ensues. <br /><br />While these were some of the elements, it&#x27;s NOT what the film was about
at all. This most definitely IS a chick flick, no two ways about it. So
don&#x27;t go into the film expecting anything else. The plot is firmly
grounded in well-trodden chick territory (bitchy and undermining BFFs,
nice guy vs. bad boy, picking a wedding dress, female depression and
self-sabotage, etc.)... its all there, and a far more prominent part of
the movie than the heavily-advertised slapstick elements. <br /><br />Now, with that having been said, it is still a damn funny movie. There
were a ton of truly hilarious scenes, and really well developed and
relatable characters. It&#x27;s not entirely the film that the trailers want
you to think it is, but worthwhile nonetheless. <br /><br />Instead of &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; with women, a more apt comparison might be
&#x27;Mean Girls&#x27; with grownups... of some combination of the two. Which
really isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all.
