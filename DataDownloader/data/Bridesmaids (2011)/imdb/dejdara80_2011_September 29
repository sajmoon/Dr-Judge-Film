This IS the most disappointing movie I have seen this year. I saw the
high ratings on IMDb, and even great ratings on otherwise unforgiving
meta-critics so i gave it a shot. What a mistake. Movie is mildly
saying...catastrophic. The humor, the plot, the lines...its like its
been made by 10 year old girl. I really cant believe that people found
this movie hilarious or funny. It starts a bit promising but i was
preparing myself for awesomeness that has been promised from various
reviews, and i waited and waited....but nothing happened. The acting
itself is not that bad, but the plot, clich&#xE9; dialogs, and dullness was
killing my brain cells. <br /><br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
