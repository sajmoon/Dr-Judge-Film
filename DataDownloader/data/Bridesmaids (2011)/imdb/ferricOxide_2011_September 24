All the promotional material for the movie gives the impression that
it&#x27;s going to be a comedy. It gives the impression that it&#x27;s going to
be a female buddy movie in a similar vein to The Bachelor Party.
Instead, it&#x27;s 115 minutes of unfunny, hatefully mean-spirited garbage
with, what little comedy is to be found in the movie, 15 minutes at the
end that tries to make you forget how awful the prior part of the movie
was.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of the experience of seeing this movie was
that I didn&#x27;t spend $25 on tickets to see it at the local googolplex.
Instead, I only paid 480 Microsoft points. I still feel kind of
butt-raped for having spent those points, though.
