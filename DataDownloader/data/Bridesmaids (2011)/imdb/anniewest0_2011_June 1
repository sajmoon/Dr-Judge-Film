Kristen Wiig, you deserve and Oscar, and I know I&#x27;m not the only one
who thinks that. Maya Rudolph, you shat in the middle of a busy street.
That takes some serious balls. In general I really liked this movie,
and that &#x22;like&#x22; would be love were it not for the fact it sometimes
dragged and let the air out. Could have been a crisp 90-100 min film,
but for some reason that&#x27;s verboten nowadays unless you&#x27;re a small
indie. Judd Apatow, I blame you. You&#x27;re clearly great at what you do
but you make us sit though epic comedies and it does the films a
disservice. Overall though, I laughed, I felt for the main character,
and I thought the film was surprisingly soulful. A generous 8/10.
