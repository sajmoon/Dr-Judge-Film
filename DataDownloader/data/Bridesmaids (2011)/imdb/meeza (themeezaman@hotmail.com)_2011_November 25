2011_November 25 
I am sorry to separate myself from most of the moviegoer audience, but
I just did not feel the love of &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; and think it&#x27;s the most
overrated movie of the year. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I did not mind
walking down the cinematic aisle with a viewing of &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;. It
did have its share of shits and giggles, especially the former in a
most- talked about bridal dress shop scene. But the movie has been
hailed as the top comedy of 2011 by many film critics, and I just don&#x27;t
think it deserves that ring of honor. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; stars the always
enigmatic Kristen Wiig as Annie, yea she is a bridesmaid and also the
maid of honor of her best gal pal Lilian played by Maya Rudolph. Annie
is intimidated by Lilian&#x27;s new close friend Helen (Rose Byrne) who is
an egocentric socialite who will stop at nothing to be Lilian&#x27;s new
best friend and dethrone Annie from that classification. Sounds like
silly teenage girls battling for a &#x22;best friend&#x22; confirmation, doesn&#x27;t
it? Well, that is pretty much how it is in &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;. Now, that is
not what &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is all about. There is the rest of Lilian&#x27;s
bridesmaids entourage- the bored housewife Rita (Wendi
McClendon-Covey), the adventure-seeker Becca (Ellie Kemper), and the
zany Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Director Paul Feig dresses up
&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; with many aspects that have already been addressed in
other chick-flick movies; the jealous friend, the villainous socialite,
the crazy obese character, and the formulaic rom-com storyline. The
primary romantic storyline in the movie is of Annie and police officer
Nathan Rhodes. They are opposites that are destined to be together; and
their boy-gets-girl, girl-loses- boy, girl-desperately tries to get boy
again-in movie&#x27;s final scene is a narrative feature that has been
exposed way too many times in this genre. Sure, I am speaking now to
forever hold this piece on what is awry of &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;, but there was
some positive uniformity in the film. Kirsten Wiig was very good as
Annie, and the Annie protagonist is what made me want to hold on to
&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; as much as I can. Wiig continues to get &#x22;wiiigy with it&#x22;
as one of the best female comedic actresses in today&#x27;s Hollywood. Chris
O&#x27;Dowd no doubt was arrestingly charismatic as the witty-liner Officer
Dowd. And it was very joyous, even though a bit heartbreaking, to see
legendary actress Jill Clayburgh in her final performance as Annie&#x27;s
mom. Clayburgh passed away a few months ago. Wiig and Annie Mumolo
scripted up the &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; screenplay with some funny lines, but not
enough in the &#x22;laugh out loud&#x22; department. A lot has been talked about
new comedy queen Melissa McCarthy&#x27;s performance as the madcap Megan,
now it was good but not to the level of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar
nomination as it has been buzzed around. Megan sure did a bit of
scene-stealing in &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; but I think it does have a bit of
Alan-takeoff in them. You don&#x27;t know what I am referring to, stream or
Netflix &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; and &#x22;The Hangover Part 2&#x22;, which it would be an
exercise of futility because chances are you already saw them. Jon
Hamm&#x27;s performance as a womanizer who uses Annie for sex is one of the
most pointless performances of the year, Hamm is a good actor and I
don&#x27;t want him to be a mad man towards me for my comments but his
talents were wasted here. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is a recommendable feature, but
there is not enough colorful-movie coordination for it to be proclaimed
as a comedic classic. *** Average
