You ever have that movie that everyone loved and you despised with
every fiber of your being? That&#x27;s this movie for me.<br /><br />Something I&#x27;ve noticed in reviews for this film is that the word
&#x22;funny&#x22; keeps popping up. Yet no one can name WHY this movie is funny.
They just say that it is and we&#x27;re supposed to take their word for it.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a man and I found this movie horrendously unfunny and miserable.
It&#x27;s not like the premise is unfunny, so why isn&#x27;t it registering with
me? For me, the movie fails because it only focuses on the negative
aspects of these shenanigans. It only shows how these events affect our
hero in a BAD way. This isn&#x27;t funny, it&#x27;s just depressing.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know who would like this film, and the people I do know who
like it can&#x27;t explain why. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the worst film ever
made, but it&#x27;s MY most hated. It is one of two films where I honestly
considered walking out and asking for my money back.(The other being
the 2010 version of Alice In Wonderland)
