This is probably the most honest and thorough examination of women I&#x27;ve
seen on the big screen ever. Kristen Wiig breaks out from SNL into a
movie star as forlorn Annie Walker, with beautiful awkwardness. Annie
is the sad sack who screws up everything in her best friend Lillian&#x27;s
(Maya Rudolph, also from SNL) pre-wedding soirees, but you still root
for her to find success and happiness. You also root for her to redeem
herself against Helen Harris (Rose Byrne), the gorgeous trophy wife who
appears to be an unwilling participant in a BFF competition. All and
all, it&#x27;s one of those you&#x27;ll laugh, you&#x27;ll cry movies, and I highly
recommend it.
