Annie (Wiig) plays a character going through tough times. In fact, you
would think it&#x27;s a drama based on how depressed she is. But she is
tasked with planning her best friend&#x27;s (Rudolph) wedding. There, we
meet the antagonist along with some of the other bridesmaids.<br /><br />Melissa McCarthy was unbelievably hilarious in this movie. Every single
scene she was in was funny. Some of the other bridesmaids were
excellent like Rose Byrne and Ellie Kemper.<br /><br />Every situation Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (the co-writers) put the
bridesmaids in allowed the women to do what they do best--be funny.<br /><br />For people comparing this movie to the Hangover, they are completely
different premises with a few similarities. But there is no doubt that
the Hangover Part 2 will have to be extremely funny to top this one.<br /><br />Kudos to Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy for making some of the most
classic scenes that people will still be laughing to years from now.
