So, you all know the story. Kristen Wiig plays Annie, the oldest best
friend of Lillian (Maya Rudolf), the bride. Annie is down on her luck
after her bakery goes out of business, and she has a cad of a boyfriend
played by John Hamm. Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor.
However, Lillian now has another close friend named Helen (played by
Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, beautiful, thin, and sophisticated. So,
Helen begins to dominate the wedding activities like picking the
dresses, planning the bachelorette party, hosting the wedding shower,
etc. Annie&#x27;s bridesmaid outing to a Brazilian Steakhouse is a big flop,
and everything Helen does is beautiful. Annie gets really jealous and
ticked off by Helen and after many problems, gets kicked out of the
wedding by Lillian.<br /><br />This movie was just decent for me. Fairly funny with a few times where
the crowd did burst into laughter. However, it was not laughs from
start to finish. The characters were pretty well developed, and it was
a bit chick-flicky. Annie has some pity party moments, and near the end
Lillian and Annie sit on Lillian&#x27;s bed and talk over all Lillian&#x27;s
bride panic problems. That was a bit &#x22;womanly&#x22; emotional stuff to me (a
guy).<br /><br />A pleasant surprise was Chris O&#x27;Dowd playing a cop, Officer Nathan
Rhodes. He pulls Annie over for broken tail lights on her car. Nathan
is charming, funny, believable, and sincere as he falls for Annie.<br /><br />Other reviewers complain about the toilet humor and sex in the movie. I
did not see any problem with it. The toilet issues relate to food
poisoning, and are limited to one scene. There is relatively little
sexual content. A couple of scenes of Annie lying next to a man in bed
with no action or body parts. Just lying in bed. A few humorous bits of
dialog here and there about sexual topics, but nothing really graphic
or gross.<br /><br />Worth the $1.50 I paid for it.
