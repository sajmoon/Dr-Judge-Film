This is a wonderful, fun, funny, heartfelt movie. I am an older man, I
expected the typical chick-flick but I was very pleasantly surprised,
it is so entertaining. The chemistry between ALL of the actors was
great. There are so many things to be impressed with in this movie. The
casting was absolutely superb. Every actor is perfect for their part in
the movie and could be a separate movie by themselves. The script is
wonderful, it keeps you entertained with laughter even during dramatic
moments, and it works.<br /><br />I cannot stop thinking about this movie, I will be seeing it again very
soon. Do you yourself a favor and see this movie, you will not be
sorry.
