I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet - this is a solid 6. It&#x27;s got some funny
parts and some boring parts (for a guy) and not enough interaction
between Kristen Wiig and easily the most likable character, Rhodes. If
you&#x27;re an SNL watcher, you&#x27;ll definitely recognize some signature Wiig
mannerisms, which I didn&#x27;t love because it made it more difficult to
see her as a character and not just Kristen Wiig.<br /><br />I asked my wife what she thought and she said she&#x27;d give it a 7 or 8
and the mostly female audience was laughing much of the movie, so I
would say women (in general) would find this a little more enjoyable
than I did.<br /><br />It has its good and bad moments and borders on &#x22;chick flick&#x22; at times,
but you could do a LOT worse for something to watch with your
significant other.
