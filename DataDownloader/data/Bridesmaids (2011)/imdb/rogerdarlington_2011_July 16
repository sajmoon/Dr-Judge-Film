Hollywood is constantly pumping out crude, gross-out comedies aimed at
testosterone-charged young men, so it&#x27;s a change to have a comedy with
a good dose of both crudity and grossness aimed at women of an older
age demographic. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is a chick-flick that will appeal to
many guys too and, at its best, it is laugh-out loud funny.<br /><br />At its core is Kristen Wiig as maid of honour Annie who gives a
marvellously naturalistic performance that reminds us of Meg Ryan at
her height (&#x22;When Harry Met Sally&#x22;) and Wiig - familiar to American
viewers but unknown outside North America - also deserves credit as
co-author of the often sharp and acerbic script.<br /><br />But is this a movie that feminists will find appealing? I&#x27;m glad you
asked. On the one hand, there are six leading roles for women actors
here and ultimately the film is about female friendship and support. We
avoid the bums and breasts that would be in a male-oriented gross-out,
but lovemaking scenes in which the woman wears her underwear look
ridiculous and we still have vomit and faeces.<br /><br />On the other hand, a narrative that places at its heart the notion that
the marriage ceremony and all that leads up to it is the height of any
woman&#x27;s aspiration and consequently worth throwing inordinate amounts
of energy, time and money at is deeply unfeminist. And the only
developed male character in the movie is an Irish state patrolman of
unbelievable gentleness.
