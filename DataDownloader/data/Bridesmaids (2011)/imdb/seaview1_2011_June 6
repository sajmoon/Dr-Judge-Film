TV&#x27;s Saturday Night Live has long been a proving ground for some of the
top comedians who have often gone on to greater fame. Witness John
Belushi (Animal House), Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading
Places), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Will Ferrell (Anchorman),
and Tina Fey (30 Rock) among many. Certainly a few have failed in films
like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber. Current female SNL
player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids,
an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately
love. After numerous supporting roles in popular films like
Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and
she co-wrote the screenplay too! Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single
woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life
consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon
Hamm). Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible
roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby. When her best
friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to
be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns,
showers, and the reception. When Lillian&#x27;s wealthy, &#x27;perfect&#x27; friend,
Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take
over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes
things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship). In a
series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal
ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend. Along the way
she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O&#x27;Dowd), who takes
a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her?
It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her
anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her
apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an
outsider to her best friend&#x27;s wedding, Annie&#x27;s fate takes a dramatic
turn amid friendship and love.<br /><br />Audiences have been well aware of Wiig&#x27;s physical and whimsical skills
as a skit comedienne. What this film does is show an entirely different
spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo
directed by Paul Feig). By playing a sympathetic character with flaws
and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented
actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had
life&#x27;s ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that
the payoff at the end is more satisfying. The scenes between Wiig and
O&#x27;Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the
story on a firm emotional footing. As one of Lillian&#x27;s friends, Melissa
McCarthy (Mike &#x26; Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the
film with some of its funniest moments in support. Even Byrne shines as
the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi
McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party. As Annie&#x27;s mom, Clayburgh
performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film. Jon Hamm
is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments. A toast to Lillian and her fianc&#xE9; by
Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly
and outrageous. When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays
her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test. A scene
where she sits at her mom&#x27;s home alone watching a video of Castaway&#x27;s
scene of Tom Hanks losing his &#x27;best friend&#x27; Wilson is a hoot. On the
plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes
obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with
McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal.
Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter
and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as
the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual
gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.<br /><br />The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes
especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes
a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are
the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy. When her
relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated,
desperate behavior. She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a
good man because she has never been treated so nice. It&#x27;s really about
Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human
being. In fact, Annie&#x27;s plight and desperation shares its DNA with
Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary.<br /><br />With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old
Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling.
Don&#x27;t think of this as just a &#x27;chick flick&#x27; but rather an entertaining,
contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen. And do stay
for the closing credits if you want a bit of raunchy fun.
