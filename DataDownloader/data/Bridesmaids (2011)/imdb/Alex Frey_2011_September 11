It doesn&#x27;t happen often that I would give 10 stars to a movie just like
that but this one deserves it because it got balls, balls on what many
viewers hope to be a chic flick which it is not to my satisfaction. If
I knew what to expect I would rate this movie probably with 8.5 stars
but after reading how disappointed the romantic comedy fraction is
about this movie, who expected another boy meets girl, boy falls in
love, they have a have a break up and get back together in the end kind
of movie it deserves the whole 10 points. Haven&#x27;t we seen them all?
Haven&#x27;t we seen them enough? I sure did and this movie kept surprising
me the entire 2 hours. I didn&#x27;t really know where it would go, I didn&#x27;t
know why it is going where it is going, and while it was crossing
several lines of good taste it was surprisingly touching.<br /><br />This movie got Kristen Wiig in the lead, she is not cut out for a
romantic comedy, she is weird on SNL and she was weird in this movie
and the role was perfect for her. This movie isn&#x27;t even a comedy or a
drama it is pure satire and it shows women doing men stuff. I am sure
that is upsetting a lot of men and makes them insecure. The movie
provides rare insight for men what women think about us men in bed and
what they dream of, it is not another Cinderella Story and that is the
charm about it. It was refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy (Mike &#x26;
Molly) from her dark side, it actually fits her brilliantly and even me
as a guy was charmed by Chris O&#x27;Dowd in his role as officer Rhodes.<br /><br />This movie features plenty of scenes with profanity which I wouldn&#x27;t
dare to laugh at if it was done with men but since these things
happened to women I simply loved it since I have never seen it before.
This was a new kind of movie to me and I can only recommend to see it
if you like dark satire and when you are not ashamed to see bad things
happen to good people, if you are the type of person who likes to see
one of those streamlined romantic comedies you will be disgusted. You
certainly need a brain for this movie because it doesn&#x27;t have a
dramatic soundtrack that tells you where to laugh and where to cry it
has no music whatsoever, it let&#x27;s the characters act it out and that
suits this movie quite well, however there are people who need a
soundtrack since they don&#x27;t know the concept of sarcasm and satire and
they will end up confused.<br /><br />I quote one of the other reviewers since he analyzed it brilliantly,
this is the ultimate anti chick flick. This is a love it or hate it
kind of film, the reviews clearly show that, it is new and provocative
and in 10 years the same people who are ripping this movie apart today
won&#x27;t remember why they did it. As time goes by movies evolve and cross
more and more lines, this movie is a front runner when it comes to
that.
