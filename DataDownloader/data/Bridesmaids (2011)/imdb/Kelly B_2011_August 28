My girlfriend kept asking me if we&#x27;d go out to see Brides Maids which
would also be enjoyable by us males as well. After having her beg just
a little more I decided to go see it with her. The opening scene was
memorable but after that it went downhill very fast, after about 30-40
minutes in the movie we looked at each other and I asked her what she
thought of this movie. I was glad to hear she shared my opinion about
this movie being annoying instead of funny... I guess the problem with
the genre is that jokes for some people don&#x27;t work for other. The key
to make a great comedy is to have different kinds of jokes to serve
different kinds of people. The jokes (or tries to make them) in this
movie were just focused on one type of people. For us (and a lot of
people in the same theater), they became annoying instead of funny.
