How one feels about the raunchy female kink-fest Bridesmaids also
hinges on how much one likes (and/or can tolerate) the old
Wilson-Phillips standby, &#x22;Hold On&#x22; (for real). The song is an admitted
guilty-pleasure to many (including myself); but Bridesmaids shouldn&#x27;t
be quite the guilty pleasure as that song as there should be NO guilt
in liking this female driven Judd Apatow-production (thanks to him we
have Superbad, Knocked-Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Anchorman, Step
Brothers etc in our video libraries!!). <br /><br />It is a rare female-driven bawdy comedy along the lines of The Hangover
(but NOT as graphic or extreme) that is smart, crafty and
emotionally-driven with a mature-comedic performance by its star,
Kristen Wiig (SNL, Knocked Up, Whip It). Wiig&#x27;s Annie finds her life
spiraling downward after her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph - SNL,
Idiocracy, Away We Go) becomes engaged and her life appears to be
approaching &#x22;perfection&#x22;. I MUST say and stress that Wiig is a marvel
here and her bridal shower meltdown is one for the record books
(cookie, anyone?!). Wiig may have been around for years; but this
performance solidified her as a comedy star.<br /><br />With a &#x22;new&#x22; best friend (Rose Byrne - Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later,
Insidious, &#x22;Damages&#x22;) who steamrolls into Lillian&#x27;s life, Annie feels
abandoned and alone when all of her thoughts and concerns should be
focused on the upcoming nuptials of her best friend. The drama that
plays out behind the film&#x27;s comedy is surprisingly sophisticated and
grown-up and very realistic. Add to this comedy-drama some
fine-supporting players as in the UNCREDITED sleazy/sexist Jon Hamm
(&#x22;Mad Men&#x22;, The Town, The Day the Earth Stood Still); a still radiant
but SADLY late Jill Clayburgh (Love and Other Drugs, An Unmarried
Woman, Running with Scissors) in her last role; and a perky Ellie
Kemper (Somewhere, &#x22;The Office&#x22;, Get Him to the Greek) and Bridesmaids
has a little bit of everything for everyone (although fellow supporting
player Melissa McCarthy of TV&#x27;s &#x22;Mike &#x26; Molly&#x22; takes it a bit too far).<br /><br />Even if the film is all-about Annie and her fellow bridesmaids ... I
think the story of ANYone being &#x22;left behind&#x22; as a friend moves onto
the next stages of his/her life is a universal one. Wiig&#x27;s performance
captures the fragility of a scared individual who&#x27;s life has not turned
out according to plan ... but as the story (and song) can attest -- if
one can &#x22;hold on for one more day ...&#x22; things may change.<br /><br />Life does come at us one day at a time ... it is too bad that films
like this come around much less often.
