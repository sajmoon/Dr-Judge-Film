Loved love loved Bridesmaids so much that I went to see it twice in 1
week! It is a brilliant and very funny movie.<br /><br />I was not expecting it to be as good or funny as it turned out to be! I
was also not expecting to hear a PROPER Irish accent either. Well done
Chris O&#x27;Dowd! I thought it was funnierthan The Hangover, which I know
is a bold statement. You get to know and love each of the main
characters. The chemistry between them is visible and the script is
witty and fun.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this when it comes out on DVD! I would also
love to see a sequel to this too!
