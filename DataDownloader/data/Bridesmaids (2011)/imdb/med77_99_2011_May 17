Let me start by saying that I adore Rose Byrne, I just think she has
grown into a really talented actress, and in Bridesmaid here, she
played her role to perfection. I loved her in the Horror movie
Insidious released just few months ago, and always been a fan in
Damages.<br /><br />Bridesmaids tells the story of Annie, a single middle aged woman
struggling with her own life when her best friend Lillian gets engaged
and assigns Annie as her maid of honor. Worried about losing her best
friend and pressured by leading the bridesmaid, things start to spiral
out of control. And to make things worse, she has to compete with
Lillian&#x27;s new friend, the rich and always competitive Helen ( played by
none other than Rose Byrne ) who seems to be trying to steal Lillian&#x27;s
friendship. <br /><br />The movie has plenty of laugh out loud moments, very hilarious, funny
and at times disgusting scenes. It came out as a real fresh Comedy that
I enjoyed most parts of. The characters were lovable, funny and
interesting to follow, and the actresses playing them were very good.
The problem I found with Bridesmaid was in the editing, it seems it was
done in a rush and so appeared choppy and inappropriate. For example,
in an early scene when Annie was making a speech, she was holding a
wine glass, and in that same scene, the glass is quickly shifted from
the right hand to the left hand then back to the right hand. And there
were many other editing problems I noticed that I won&#x27;t go through
here, but it was obvious. Also I thought some scenes were a bit
ridiculous and too long. The whole movie running time was a bit too
long for me as they could have easily cut some unnecessary scenes.<br /><br />In summary, a pretty decent and fresh Comedy with laugh out loud
moments and funny characters that falls just short from being great
with some ridiculous scenes, it drags a bit and was a bit too long in
my opinion.
