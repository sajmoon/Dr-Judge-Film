This spring, Universal Pictures and producer Judd Apatow (Knocked Up,
The 40-Year-Old Virgin) invite you to experience Bridesmaids. Kristen
Wiig leads the cast as Annie, a maid of honor whose life unravels as
she leads her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), and a group of
colorful bridesmaids (Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi
McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper) on a wild ride down the road to
matrimony. Annie&#x27;s life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime
best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian&#x27;s maid of
honor. Though lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the
expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect,
she&#x27;ll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you&#x27;ll go for
someone you love.<br /><br />well finally i saw this movie that i couldn&#x27;t wait to watch. i was so
much curious and anticipated to watch this movie since i saw those
overwhelming positive reviews that it got mostly by Critics. which
literally shocked me to hell since it is a R rated comedy. most of
those silly humor doesn&#x27;t please Critics and me too. i don&#x27;t like silly
comedies too but if a movie no matter which type or genre is actually
good then why wouldn&#x27;t Critics appreciate it. Judd Apatow gave some
Critics friendly movies, he is the producer of this movie.<br /><br />this was one of my most anticipated movies this year, i had really high
hopes with it and i am so glad to tell you this that it really lived up
to my expectations, literally. i was not a regular viewer of Saturday
Night Live but use to see it when it was on TV, the repeat telecast.
and i am a big fan of these ladies especially Kristen, Maya and
obviously Tina. Kristen wiig stands out from the rest of ensemble cast.
i really liked her in this movie. i really wish her a great and bright
career ahead and hope to see more of her good movies.<br /><br />i hardly remember giving a 4.5 Star rating to any other comedy like
this except for dark comedies. this is such a lovely and pleasant
surprise from this time. this is story of Annie, she is a bit lonely as
far as her love life is. she has a childhood good buddy, Lillian who is
going to get married and obviously she is been chose as Maid of Honor.
she sees a competition from Helen who is more of a expensive buyer and
bizarre girl tries to make differences between them too step by step
and during this competition she sees herself loosing her best friend
and we see hilarious sequences where troubles breaks out. what happens
in the end, not gonna tell.<br /><br />this is not a very fast paced or boring but a slow moving movie that
never gets boring or tiring even with a running time of nearly 2 hours.
i loved everything that is there in the movie. this movie is one of the
most actually funniest movies i have seen lately. i actually laughed a
lot. in few scenes i had some uncontrollable laughter. this is comedy
at its best. hilarious movie with seriously looking humor. i really
liked how it is not so much filled with silly gross crude humor. i mean
it is there but not completely filled by it. very nicely and
intelligently written. in the end it turns towards a bit softer drama
that will really touch you. and overall a Chick Flick feel to it.<br /><br />very good direction by Paul Feig. i am really impressed by the writers.
really superb job with one of the best written comedies. excellent
screenplay, nice plot and story. it may get a bit uneven in the middle
but not much that overall effects the movie. nicely done acting by
Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi
McLendon-Covey , Ellie Kemper , Jill Clayburgh , Chris O&#x27;Dowd , Rebel
Wilson , Mic hael Hitchcock , Matt Lucas , Tim Heidecker , Terry Crews
and others. really nice comic timings by everyone. i liked Kristen
Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Melissa McCarthy in it. you will see my favorite
good looking and dashing actor Jon Hamm in this movie too with a minor
role. i really like him. he has a hilarious sequence with Kristen in
the beginning of the movie. it has other good things too.<br /><br />i would definitely recommend you this most delightful lovable and
excellent comedy of the year. i must say there are many R rated
comedies coming this year and this movie has set a bar. i am not sure
most of them would be able to reach it. Do Watch guys.
