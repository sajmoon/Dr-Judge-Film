This is a boring film.<br /><br />This is what happens when a not very talented actress writes and
produces a film and is in the main lead. She is annoying as hell and
the scenes that are supposed to be funny fall flat. Especially the one
on the plane to Las Vegas.<br /><br />In the final part the film tries to become sentimental but by then I
was way past caring for the main characters. The only person who acted
was Jill Clayburgh. What a contrast between her acting and the others.<br /><br />I saw it via Netflix DVD and thank goodness I did not pay money to see
this nonsense in theaters. I only wish that I could have seen some
other DVD instead.
