So after receiving rave reviews I decided to see Bridesmaids. It was a
very good comedy. It was VERY funny and had some stand-out scenes. The
comedy&#x27;s success comes forward because of Kristen Wiig. I had already
mentioned that she was by far the best cast member in Saturday Night
live, but not only is she great at the comedy but she also gives a
heartfelt character. Melissa mcCarthy was also enjoyable, as was Rose
Byrne who was freakin HOT. Overall, I was pleased with this comedy. My
complaints would be that while it is a very funny film, there is
nothing that stands out as original in its storyline and it is rather
formulaic when the plot is looked at. Still, definitely enjoyable and
worth a watch.
