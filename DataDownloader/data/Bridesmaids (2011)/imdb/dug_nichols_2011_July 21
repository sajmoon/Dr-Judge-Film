This was actually a really nice surprise. I pictured myself cringing
through two hours of insufferable pain, while paying down the,
&#x27;Pay-Back Movie Contract&#x27;. Was I ever wrong? Maybe I should stop right
there. You probably do not know what the, &#x27;Pay-Back Movie Contract&#x27; is.
That is OK, I will explain - I am here for that. Let&#x27;s say a guy takes
his wife or significant other to an action or scary movie. You walk out
of the theater discussing different segments of the movie you just
viewed. Little did you know that a legal and binding contract was being
filed in the cerebral court of one&#x27;s spouse. You better respect that
contract, or else. Enough of all that. When I found out that we were
going to see Bridesmaids I knew I had to prepare, but I did not have
the time to dream up an illness or excuse. I was in for it. I mean -
even the name implied the movie would be bad for man-viewers. I knew
this was going to be a massively gross chick flick&#x85;my brain began to
scream so load I thought my coronal sutures would fail. About ten to
fifteen minutes into the film, I had to eat my words. Even though the
movie depended heavily on poddy and poopy based juvenile humor, I could
not stop laughing. I may not like many shows for women (This is
probably because I am not a woman) and I don&#x27;t care about touchy-feely,
boo-hoo, fluffy-foo-foo characters caught in some never-ending,
non-stop, redundant story about chicky junk - I enjoyed this flick.
This was an out and out funny story - well written and well acted -
bravo.
