Going into the film, I thought it would be a typical modern chick-flick
although I was pleasantly surprised when i realized that I was laughing
non-stop.<br /><br />The film stars fantastic women comedy actors,the best in fact and the
star of the IT crowd and one of my favorite actors Chris O&#x27;Dowd. It is
about a wedding and rivalries between the bridesmaids, Kristen Wiig is
fantastic from start to finnish. Although I only noticed as the credits
played at the end that Judd Apatow produced it, therefor it must be
funny.<br /><br />The film will have you in tears. A must watch, maybe even the comedy of
the year.
