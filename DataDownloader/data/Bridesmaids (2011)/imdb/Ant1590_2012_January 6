Having heard good things about Bridesmaids, I was really looking
forward to watching this film. Boy was I let down! I actually turned
off my TV half way through the movie. While this film does have its
moments, the moments are only somewhat funny. On top of that, there is
not one original joke. I now can relate to the many other bad reviews
on this board.<br /><br />On the flip side...wait...there really is no flip side. This is an
average comedy at best. This may sound harsh, but I truly believe my
third grade self could compete with the humor in this film. I also
think that many people share this belief. In conclusion, if your
looking for a gut busting comedy, keep on looking cause this film isn&#x27;t
one of them.
