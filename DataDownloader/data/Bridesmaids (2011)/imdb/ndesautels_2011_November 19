I really don&#x27;t know why people liked this so much. When I saw the
preview it didn&#x27;t look that great but after all the hype and good
reviews I figured I better give it a chance. I loved the Hangover and
since I keep hearing that this film was the female version I was
expecting some great adult humour.<br /><br />This film is nothing like the Hangover! Just adding some jokes about
shitting yourself does not make it a edgy. The lead character is
extremely unlikable, and though she acts like a complete dick
throughout the film towards her friend and love interest she never
apologies and for some reason they end up apologizing to her. <br /><br />The pacing was terrible, the film was way too long. The jokes were few
and far between. The characters were very undeveloped and soulless. The
whole thing was pretty pointless. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.
