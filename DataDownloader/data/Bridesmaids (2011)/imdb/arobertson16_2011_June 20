I have only one word to describe this movie, AWFUL!!! This is badly
written, poorly acted and edited and after about 30 minutes I wanted to
walk out, something I have never had the urge to do in the movies
before! The whole movie is one bad scene after another and seems only
to rely on gross out toilet jokes and other disgusting humor that makes
me want to wretch at the thought. It seems a lot of Hollywood movies
lately are getting more and more daring on the things they get their
actors to say and do. I&#x27;m all for realism in movies and I don&#x27;t object
to cursing or natural bodily functions being used in a humorous way but
when whole movies seem to be based on these jokes it really starts to
wear thin and just seems to be a desperate way to get audiences to
laugh out loud. When you take away all the gross out jokes from this
movie all we are left with is a nonsensical plot that goes nowhere,
characters that seem unrealistic and one dimensional and a feeling that
Hollywood has dropped yet another bomb into an already overflowing
toilet bowl.
