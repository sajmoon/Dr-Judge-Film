Something does not seem to add up. Something seems to have passed me by
and I have no idea what it is. As I sit down and recollect what took
place during the past 125 minutes I am overcome by mixed sensations of
satisfaction and disappointment. How will I rate this? This is the
constant thought that is running across my mind whilst I recollect my
thought. I always had 4 stars in mind, 4 out of 10! I know I am being
very pessimistic and sincerely I feel I am a bit too harsh on my
opinion. Hence I am content to settle with 6 stars, 6 out of 10!<br /><br />Are you familiar with the term Ventricular fibrillation? In Layman
terms it&#x27;s a condition where a human has an irregular heartbeat.
Normally our hearts beat almost to that of the beat of the Bee Gees hit
Staying alive. Now picture the same beat on a heart rate monitor. A
normal beat Vs a patient who is suffering with VF. Erratic lines will
be jumping all over the monitor and if something is not done about it
the patient sadly will die. This is what the flow of comedy was in
Bridesmaids. It was very erratic, the funny scenes are very scarce
however when it did get funny, oh boy does it crack you up. The scenes
are amazingly well written and brilliantly interpreted by the cast.
However once that particular scene is done and dusted with it bogs down
tremendously. Now this brings me to the script. Written by Kristen Wiig
and Annie Mumolo I have strong feeling this was entirely written for
women. I am not exaggerating. I am seated in a theatre full of women
whilst I watch this. I am also overhearing a lot of negative chatter on
the movie as well. This is one in particular that stuck in my head
&#x22;This is nothing like Hangover&#x22;. Exactly what my thoughts are as I am
watching the movie. I believe the marketing campaign was a bit
misleading to a few us since this was supposed to be the female version
of The Hangover. In fact they did approach Todd Phillips for the
directorial however does not seem to have worked out well. <br /><br />When Lillian (Maya Rudolph) quite unexpectedly is to be married, best
friend Annie (Kristen Wiig) is unanimously picked as her maid of honor.
Annie who has no sense of direction in life hits rock bottom and now
there is now way to go but up or so she thinks. At the rehearsal dinner
Annie is introduced to Lillians&#x27; fianc&#xE9;s bosses wife (Did I lose you
there?) aka Helen (Rose Byrne). There is saying &#x22;The party starts after
a toast is made&#x22;. OK I made that up, but really after 25 minutes into
the movie, break out its first comic relief. It was hilarious and my
sides hurt after all the laughter! Annie feels she is being stepped on
by Helen and wants to regain control of all that is left until the
wedding day. Sounding a bit like Bride Wars, Monster in Law at this
point of time, it actually is quite similar although it should not be
mistaken for a parody. Regardless of it all, the 6 ladies bond in an
effort for making this a successful wedding treat for Lillian. Megan
(Melissa McCarthy) who is the sister of the groom and Officer Rhodes
(Chris O Dowd) are the show stealers. In fact the directorial approach
by Paul Feig is felt more like that of THE IT CROWD or EPISODES
(Sitcoms). It&#x27;s not slapstick like Jack Black doing Cartwheels in
Lilliput. It&#x27;s all in the script and its lines and its very little
acting but more of the dialogue that matters.<br /><br />Undoubtedly I am clearly a minority who share this opinion, since this
summer hit was very well accepted by our viewers; however I do know
that there is a potential market out there that has misread the entire
advertising campaign and would feel as I do. <br /><br />YES YOU NEED TO BE DRUNK TO HAVE THE HANGOVER!<br /><br />Title: Bridesmaids Directed by: Paul Feig Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya
