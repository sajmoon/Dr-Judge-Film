Bridesmaids is not the feel-good teen sex farce it initially passes
itself off to be. Instead, it&#x27;s bizarrely reminiscent of Alien, in that
the entire cast is older, seasoned and no longer the wild party-going
folk we&#x27;d expect of them. While there are laugh-out-loud moments, the
more substantial themes of life-altering change, staying true to
oneself, and recognizing the power of friendship, are dark and serious.
Once the dilemmas hit and the lead character begins her downward
spiral, the joke-a-minute pacing from the introduction is lost -
reflection, problem solving, reparation and forgiveness replace the
humor, along with lengthy scenes of drunkenness or bad decisions that
simply aren&#x27;t that humorous.<br /><br />Annie (Kristen Wiig) has just lost her bakery &#x22;Cake Baby,&#x22; is forced to
move in with an incredibly weird brother and sister team, is barely
able to pay her bills, and drives a car clearly on its last legs. She
thinks she&#x27;s reached rock bottom when her best friend Lillian (Maya
Rudolph) announces her engagement. Annie is to be the Maid of Honor,
and must put aside her personal quagmires to deal with the
responsibilities of organizing a wedding shower and bachelorette party.
She&#x27;s in for a shock when she meets the other bridesmaids, a colorful
mix of dysfunctional women: Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a loud-mouthed
mother of filthy-mouthed children; Becca (Ellie Kemper), a simple girl
with far too few worldly experiences; Megan (Melissa McCarthy), an
overly obnoxious manhunter; and Helen (Rose Byrne), a ludicrously
wealthy socialite.<br /><br />Helen poses the biggest problem &#x96; unbeknownst to Annie, Lillian has
become very close to the prettier, richer, skinnier woman, and
immediately a feud is formed. Annie wants to prove to her best friend
that she&#x27;s every bit as good as Helen, but Helen&#x27;s massive assets allow
for better partying, bigger gifts and superior treatment, especially
when it comes to a wedding dress, a trip to Paris and a luxurious manor
location for the shower. Despite the helpful distraction of bonhomous
Wisconsin state trooper Rhodes (Chris O&#x27;Dowd), who is incontestably the
perfect match for Annie, she can&#x27;t seem to top her rival, please her
longtime confidant, or get out of the rut that is her completely
depressing life.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are decent actresses, but far from
leading lady material. Since the film was written by Wiig, it&#x27;s likely
the story and script are heavily influenced by her point of view,
attributing to giving her the blame when the dialogue tries to be
representational of candid girlfriend conversations, a la Sex and the
City&#x27;s routine meal-oriented get-togethers, yet lacks funniness or
naturalness. The supporting cast frequently takes away the spotlight,
being comprised of character actors scrounged up from The Office, Reno
911!, It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mike &#x26; Molly, Mad Men,
Damages, Come Fly with Me and more, but can&#x27;t hide the saddening aspect
of roles competing to be more pathetic and engage in more embarrassing
activities (the best of which involves a food poisoning ordeal) while
being filled by B-list actresses.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)
