A genuinely funny script that didn&#x27;t really need to go the gross-out
route, it doesn&#x27;t suffer for choosing to do so anyway. At its best
during a rapid-fire first hour, the humor cools off noticeably when the
drama llama rears its head during the home stretch, like it suddenly
decided not to fully commit to any one specific identity. Though it
occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and
legitimate discomfort, the flick&#x27;s lively, personable cast is never far
off, life preserver tucked under one arm. Loaded with all-stars from
every corner of the comedy spectrum, the jokes are delivered with
predictable credibility, with many cast members also showing a
surprisingly strong set of dramatic chops to boot. Despite a sappy,
lovesick ending that seems to stand in contrast to its initial
character, this is a witty, charming, raunchy little bundle of joy
that&#x27;s as good as you&#x27;ve probably heard, no more and no less.
