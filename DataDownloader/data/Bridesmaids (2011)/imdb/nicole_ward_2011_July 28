I can see that many people obviously loved this film Bridesmaids, but I
found the complete opposite! I expected a hilarious film which was
basically &#x27;the female version of the hangover&#x27;, but it was not at all.<br /><br />The humour was not consistent throughout. Yes there were bits that I
did find very amusing, however it was only certain parts and not enough
to keep me entertained.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t have high expectations for films usually but this really
disappointed me :/ I think the storyline was a good idea and I can see
were the potential is for it. However, it wasn&#x27;t fulfilled. So much
more could have been done with it and I am shocked that the director
did not. <br /><br />With more work this could have been the amazing film it is meant to be,
which it sadly is not.
