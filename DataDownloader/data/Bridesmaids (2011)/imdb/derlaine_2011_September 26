Really disappointed in this movie. I loved Hangover, Superbad, The
Office, Blades of Glory, etc, but this movie was not that funny.<br /><br />The whole movie is about a loser character being jealous and petty
about her best friend&#x27;s wedding. Instead of being happy for her new
life and doing everything she can to make her wedding wonderful, she
spends the whole time being jealous that other girls are prettier,
richer and throw better parties than her. She only warms up to her
&#x22;rival&#x22; when the rival looks uglier than her. Wow, how shallow can you
get? <br /><br />To top it all off, the humor is not outstanding. There are about 2 good
lines in the whole movie, and the slapstick is not outrageous enough
that it&#x27;s special.
