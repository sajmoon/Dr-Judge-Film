Many people have been describing this as the female version of The
Hangover. Those people however forgot to do one tiny thing- watch both
films! Yes both films revolve around the preparation for a wedding and
contain their fair share of low brow comedy but that is where the
similarities end.<br /><br />Bridesmaids follows Annie (Kristen Wiig), the maid of honour for her
best friend Lillian&#x27;s (Maya Rudolph) wedding. While she is preparing
for the big day though, the rest of her life is falling apart around
her. Her love life is in tatters and she is struggling to keep on top
of the bills. All the while she has to set up the wedding, organise the
bride and compete with the other eccentric bridesmaids to keep things
on track.<br /><br />The main thorn in her side comes from Helen (Rose Byrne), one of
Lillian&#x27;s new friends and bridesmaids who Annie feels is taking her
friend away from her just when she needs her the most. Add to that the
other colourful Bridesmaids of Megan (Melissa McCarthy), Rita (Wendi
McLendon-Covey) and Becca (Ellie Kemper) with the continual flow of
jokes and situations and you get one decent comedy.<br /><br />What I liked about Bridesmaids was the fact that it did not shy away
from all the gruesome details just because the characters were female.
Usually women in films are depicted more prim and proper so it was
refreshing to have this change. Some might consider some of the scenes
to go a little too far or continue for just a bit too long (one scene
in particular did start to drag for me) but I felt overall it just
about hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Wiig, along with her co-stars, impresses throughout the film showing us
that she has a place as a comic actress and the addition of Chris
O&#x27;Dowd as the love interest worked well.<br /><br />If I were to pick fault with the movie then I would have to say that
some of the characters didn&#x27;t make me want to care that much about what
happened to them (but then again this is primarily a comedy not a
drama) especially the bride who I never felt had that was enjoying her
wedding at any point. Also there were probably a few too many sub-plots
and side stories that could have been shaved of to drag the time under
2 hours. Apart from that, I was pretty impressed.<br /><br />This may be one set out for the females in the audience but it is very
much a guys film as well. There is a bit of a romcom element but it
takes a backseat to the main female character driven comedy. Some will
find the jokes distasteful and not rate the movie because of this but I
was chuckling away on more than one occasion. Guys, if your going to be
dragged along to one &#x27;chick flick&#x27; this year then make sure it&#x27;s this
one.<br /><br />For further reviews feel free to check out:
