What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig&#x27;s comedy style on SNL is her
refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic
eccentrics week after week, she&#x27;s never afraid to be unsympathetic
because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her
gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her
breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version
of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009&#x27;s &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. They share an
ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context
of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won&#x27;t mistake this
movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine
Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and
breezily directed by Paul Feig (&#x22;The Office&#x22;), this is a sharp,
character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and
showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all
over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in
the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop
she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is
already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets
engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there&#x27;s competition for
the coveted role from Lillian&#x27;s new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious
Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and
Helen over Lillian&#x27;s preferential attention until the wedding day.
Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous
excesses that come from the &#x22;wedding industrial complex&#x22; with Helen
obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously
over-the-top Paris-themed shower.<br /><br />Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian&#x27;s cousin
Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie
for her single state; and Megan, the groom&#x27;s unfiltered,
adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don&#x27;t go according to
plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans
are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends
when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g.,
her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic
citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and
dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie&#x27;s
dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (&#x22;Away
We Go&#x22;) has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who
showed deft comic chops in &#x22;Get Him to the Greek&#x22;, captures the
haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with &#xE9;lan.<br /><br />However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa
McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it&#x27;s
hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is
arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey
(&#x22;Reno 911&#x22;) and Ellie Kemper (&#x22;The Office&#x22;) have their moments as
sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren&#x27;t given much screen time
to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (&#x22;Mad Men&#x22;) really nails the
blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows
toward Annie&#x27;s romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O&#x27;Dowd proves
likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop
constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her
final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing
as Annie&#x27;s whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at
125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of
the funniest movies of the year.
