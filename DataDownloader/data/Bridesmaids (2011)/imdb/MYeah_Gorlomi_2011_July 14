Today, I got out to see Bridesmaids, a raunchy female-driven comedy
that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a woman in her 30&#x27;s, living in
Milwaukee, and crumbling under personal crises. She&#x27;s gone through a
bad break up, has been forced to shut down her bakery, and has also
been chosen by her recently engaged best friend, Lillian (Played by
Maya Rudolph), to be the maid of honor at her wedding, but due to this
wedding, Annie fears that she may lose the one relationship she&#x27;s been
clinging desperately to, and along the way, discovers that she needs to
get her own priorities in line.<br /><br />Director Paul Feig, and especially screenwriters Annie Mumolo and
Kristen Wiig delight in blending real human flaws and quirks with gross
out gags and snappy one-liners, while still being able to retain
control of character development. The movie is very sweet and
thoughtful, and it&#x27;s also the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen this year, so
far, even if not everything in the picture works. It has a slight
tendency to drag, and a hit or miss romance subplot between Annie and
an Irish cop.<br /><br />But where would this movie be without its great ensemble cast? One of
the main cast standouts is obviously Wiig. She gives it her all in a
quirky, and quietly subtle performance that holds the whole movie
together. She proves she&#x27;s got lead star chops to spare, so I&#x27;ll be
waiting in line for her next movie.<br /><br />Not to be forgotten is co-cast standout, Rose Byrne, who plays
Lillian&#x27;s rich, over preparing friend, Helen, with whom Annie is
constantly competing with, and whenever Byrne takes the stage, she
doesn&#x27;t disappoint.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s Melissa McCarthy, who earns some of the biggest laughs in
the movie as Megan, the raunchy sister of Lillian&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;. They&#x27;re
just the tipping point of a great cast that also includes Wendi
McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, as well as the final film appearance of
Jill Clayburgh. These cast members give it their best, and Bridesmaids
benefits immeasurably from that.<br /><br />I&#x27;m gonna give it *** out of ****
