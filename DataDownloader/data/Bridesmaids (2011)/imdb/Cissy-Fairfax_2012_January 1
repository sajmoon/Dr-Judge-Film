2012_January 1 
Surprising in several ways how much I enjoyed this, expecting it to be
a film for a female but it was far from that, in fact to the contrary
it with much emphasis on a dry humour it was probably more suited to a
male audience.<br /><br />It was pleasantly refreshing to see, in the main, a more written based
comedy rather than the simple visual and crude masturbation type gags
of Hangover &#x26; the In Betweeners. I had to check a couple of times on
the level of English imput into this film, as the style of humour was
unlike anything I&#x27;d seen out of the States and after too many attempts
to count have probably laughed more than three times at a film from
outside of the UK or Australia for the first time since Airplane.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not to that standard, but can be applauded for at least half a
dozen genuinely funny scenes, good characters and further refreshing to
see it written by females. One of the criticisms, if any were that
having watched the additional/deleted scenes there were several that
probably warranted a place in the film and would have improved it.<br /><br />7/10 is extremely low, given some of the recent films that pass as
comedy on a rating closer to 8. This was certainly that.
