THE GOOD - I am not a romantic comedy fan. I&#x27;ll admit that. However, I
am a fan of good movies. This movie is ridiculously funny! The story
centers on a bridesmaid at odds with another bridesmaid for her best
friend&#x27;s affection. Jealousy and competition ensues! We follow our
heroine&#x27;s life as the world just continues to take a dump on her.
That&#x27;s the sum of the story. A movie about love and jealousy among the
ladies. I&#x27;m male, but I feel as if I am one of the girls in the story.
I am one of the bridesmaids as we take a glimpse into the various
relationship problems, which bind the story.<br /><br />THE QUESTIONABLE - Some may find it a little long for a two hour comedy
movie but I have to tell you - two hours of laughs. Come on! <br /><br />THE BAD - Perhaps the worst part of this film was the fact that most of
the side plot dealing with the side characters was never integrated
into the main character&#x27;s part of the movie. It almost felt like a TV
show. You know, where we are following different stories that never
really work well with the overall story. But hey whatever so&#x85; <br /><br />WHY do I give this a8/10 IMDb style or a very high 3 out of 4 stars.
Look my original IMDb rating for this film was a 7/10. But I switched
it to 8/10 because I believe the chief purpose of a comedy is to make
us laugh. I can&#x27;t say most comedy movies make you laugh and feel for
the characters throughout. This one did. More than that, this movie is
one of those stories where certain memorable scenes will stick with you
for a while. Chicks using the bathroom on the streets, breakdowns in
front of people, being used by studs for sex, getting drunk and getting
kicked off a plane... If this sounds interesting to you I&#x27;m sure you
will be interested in watching &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;.
