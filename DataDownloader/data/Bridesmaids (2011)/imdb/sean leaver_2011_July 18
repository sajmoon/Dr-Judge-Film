As per some of the other reviews, I was expecting the female equivalent
of The Hangover. To give you some perspective, I would rather have a
hangover than watch Bridesmaids again.<br /><br />The thing that&#x27;s puzzling me is who are all these people bigging it up?
Are the film makers paying crew, family &#x26; friends to vote &#x26; review
positively? I could understand a few good reviews but not the number
that are on here.<br /><br />If you really want to get the best out of this film, wait &#x27;til it&#x27;s
available on DVD. Or even better, wait until it&#x27;s broadcast on TV. The
best bits are definitely in the trailer.<br /><br />Pleae don&#x27;t waste your time &#x26; money at the cinema.
