Where to start on this terrible disaster of a movie? First of all, for
a comedy getting so much attention and success, it wasn&#x27;t funny at all.
If anything it was melancholic and absurd. I love watching movies, and
all kinds at that, but to sit through this one was nothing short of
torture.<br /><br />I like Kristen Wiig. I think she&#x27;s funny. This movie, however, falls
way short of expectations. The so called comic acts were nothing but a
series of crass and vulgar situations.<br /><br />I&#x27;m quite surprised why this is so highly rated. There must be
something wrong.
