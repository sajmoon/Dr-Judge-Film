What I loved about this film mostly is these ladies don&#x27;t mind not
looking glamorous if it means they will get a laugh. This is a rare
thing, Hollywood women rarely are seen in an uncompromising state.
Taking a film like the hangover, the women are sensible and the men
make complete fools of themselves. Heaven forbid the ladies look like
they have fun, its a rather stifling look at women in comedy,
especially when you look at romantic comedies where the female leads
rarely make much of a lasting impression.<br /><br />Enter Bridesmaids which is unashamedly funny, there are so many laugh
out loud moments that some of the slower moments can be forgiven. The
lead performance by Kristen Wigg is fantastic, as a neurotic down her
luck girl, with a sharp tongue and a magnet for disaster. Bridesmaids
works in the same way The hangover did, a great ensemble in that each
bring something different to the table. Though at times I felt more
could have been done with the supporting cast, Kristen Wiggs character
is so much fun its only a minor grievance.<br /><br />The film is a laugh riot that should appeal to everyone, despite it
looking more like a girls film, it is genuinely universally amusing. In
fact there is enough gross out humour to compete with likes of American
Pie.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is without a doubt the funniest film I&#x27;ve seen this year,
though the ending I felt was a little bit too neat any negatives are
fairly minor and are made up for by so many laugh out loud moments. I
would rather watch this a thousand times than watch the hangover part 2
again.
