In my defence I didn&#x27;t get &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; either, the brother to the
sister here. This, for me, was an overlong, only occasionally amusing
modern comedy peopled with that contrasting combination of weird and
supposedly normal people, put into supposed comedic situations by a
bachelorette party staged for a prospective bride. Thus we get the
creepily strange fat couple that rooms with Kristen Wiig&#x27;s Annie and
the even more overweight (the bigger the waistline, the stranger the
persona appears to be the rule here) groom&#x27;s sister with a penchant for
puppy dogs and a flair for picking-out air-marshals on plane-flights
who attempts to bond with Wiig at her lowest ebb. The story, if I can
call it that, is told from Wiig&#x27;s point of view and starts immediately
with her engaging in casual sex with a guy who kicks her out of bed by
morning and to whom she&#x27;s no better than his number three shag. Some
humour does emerge as she gets into a bidding competition at the
engagement party of her best friend&#x27;s Maya Randolph&#x27;s new best-friend,
the super-rich, super beautiful Helen, well-played by Rose Byrne but
after that the humour gets scatological at a posh bridal-wear shop,
drunken on board an aborted plane flight to Vegas and finally kooky and
at times surreal encounter with an off-beat cop with whom she makes an
unlikely connection. Of course it all ends up happily at the wedding,
her best-friend credentials to the bride re- established as they belt
out Wilson Phillips&#x27; feminist anthem &#x22;Hold On&#x22; and she gets reunited
with her cop but by then the laugh count had dropped even more. I&#x27;m
vaguely aware that this strain of humour mixing gross, crazy people
with so-called normals is all the rage - I&#x27;ve not even mentioned Jill
Clayburgh as Wiig&#x27;s, yes you guessed it, wigged-out mother, or some of
the other bridesmaids who drop out of the picture after an hour or so,
but this slacker humour just doesn&#x27;t float my boat, especially when it
runs way beyond 2 hours in the telling.
