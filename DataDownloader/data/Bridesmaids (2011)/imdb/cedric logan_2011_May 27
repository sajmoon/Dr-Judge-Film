Me &#x26; my boo were really stocked and looking forward to this comedy that
was getting rave reviews from critics and fans alike.so fair enough
were excited expecting a classic comedy.The opening scene was hilarious
and raunchy in all in 1 and left a little more 2 be desired from the
film from the opening..We were laughing most of the movie but then
their were like 10 minutes that could have been edited for a more
hilarious film(some bits with Kristen Wiig as Annie with the male lead
could have been trimmed for more comedy with all the ladies just
causing more mayhem AND more of Melissa McCarthy from the CBS hit TV
show &#x22;Mike Molly&#x22;, would have been heaven on earth..some spots were a
tad dull and unnecessary and took away from all the laugh out loud
moments.Overall Grade B
