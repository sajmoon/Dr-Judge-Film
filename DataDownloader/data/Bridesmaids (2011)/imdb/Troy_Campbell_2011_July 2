Hailed as the female answer to crude comedies such as The Hangover and
Knocked Up, the latest from Judd Apatow (here working as producer)
doesn&#x27;t quite reach those lofty heights. Star comedienne Kristen Wiig
(getting her first lead role after a thriving run of supporting gigs in
Paul, Whip It, Adventureland and Walk Hard) is marvellous as Annie, the
worst Maid of Honour ever, and Melissa McCarthy and Australia&#x27;s own
Rose Byrne offer noteworthy support as the chick version of Allan
(short fat guy from The Hangover) and the bitchy frenemy respectively.
However, for every hilarious &#x22;I can&#x27;t believe they just did/said that
moment&#x22; there is a lengthy run of humourless scenes that stall the
momentum. At 125 minutes Bridesmaids goes for way too long, and Maya
Rudolph is achingly dull as the wife-to-be Lillian, but there are
enough laugh-out-loud moments to ensure both sexes walk away with a
grin on their face.
