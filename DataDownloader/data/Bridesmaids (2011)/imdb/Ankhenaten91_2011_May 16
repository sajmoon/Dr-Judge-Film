You know what makes a movie like this so good? It is that the movie is
funny. Not funny in a ha ha, that was good way but you look at the
person next to you and you are both equally shocked at how good the
movie really is. Do the actors do their job? is the script funny? is
the direction good? The answer to all of these questions is yes.<br /><br />We have seen over the last 10 or so years some really funny movies, and
all of them feature women as secondary characters who might be a little
funny but the focus is never on them for too long. Here the movie takes
what could be another piece of garbage about girls doing the things
they do before they get married and elevates it to a level of greatness
that only the best of comedies can achieve.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig wrote and stars as Annie, a down on her luck 30-something
woman in Milwaukee, WI who is looking for stability after her bakery
shut down. She has a job she hates working at a jewelery store selling
wedding rings to people in love. She lives with the most vile brother
and sister possibly ever and her best friend who she has known from
childhood Lillian is getting married in Chicago to a rich guy with a
great job. Lillian is still the same great friend that she has always
been and no matter how much money or influence her new social circle
affords her it doesn&#x27;t change how she treats Annie and that is
commendable and a nice change.<br /><br />The movie is great, it isn&#x27;t afraid to be dirty and raunchy and it
loves the weird stuff that the women all do. It makes the women here
equals with anything you might see in other Judd Apatow/frat pack
movies and it gets the tone right. It could be done wrong on so many
levels but it doesn&#x27;t go for the cheap way out and it makes the movie
fun and inventive and very good.<br /><br />Cons: It is too damned long, I don&#x27;t know why this is the case with all
Apatow movies her either directs or produces but damn, cut it down
please. The subplots are a bit much in a couple of places and could be
tightened up but this is a minor flaw in comparison.<br /><br />Go see this movie, it will make you laugh and it will do it often.
Great flick!
