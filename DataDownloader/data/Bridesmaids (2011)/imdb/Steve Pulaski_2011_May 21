When it comes to comedies, anyone can be the star. Women rule in
Bridesmaids, and boy do they make some movie characters, like the wolf
pack in The Hangover seem well behaved. Judd Apatow, the comedy wizard
he is in the 2000&#x27;s, has made realistic teen films like Superbad and
dramas with comedic relief like Funny People. He is a multi-talented
screenwriter, director, and producer, and his charm is shown off in
Bridesmaids.<br /><br />Bridesmaids proves that women aren&#x27;t as calm and collective as some
other comedies make them out to be. They are not always waiting to pay
the guys&#x27; bail when they do something that gets them thrown in the
brig. They sometimes debate how they will get out of the brig. Hall
Pass showed women can have more fun than the males, and Bridesmaids
shows women can have fun doing the men&#x27;s job. 2011 is definitely the
year of the women.<br /><br />The plot: Annie (Wiig) is a failed bakery owner who&#x27;s best friend
Lillian (Rudolph) is getting married. Annie anticipates she will be the
maid of honor, but feels shoved to the side when Helen (Byrne), the
groom&#x27;s boss, begins to takeover and plan the wedding the way she sees
it.<br /><br />Annie, Lillian, and Helen are accompanied by Rita (McLendon-Covey), the
foul-mouthed mother of three, and the hilarious Megan (McCarthy), the
chubby and outspoken hilarity of the group which derives from her
quick-witted remarks and very relatable attitude to some women.<br /><br />Knowing a lot of my mom&#x27;s friends, I could pretty much play &#x22;who&#x27;s who&#x22;
and put them in the roles of the cast. I had everyone with a secondary
part and an extra laugh at every joke beside everyone in the theater.<br /><br />If cut appropriately, Bridesmaids cut fit on Saturday Night Live, the
show Kristen Wiig is currently cast on, called something like Revenge
of the Bride Buffoons. Wiig is extremely talented, and seeing her in
Adventureland, Extract, and Paul I can say I&#x27;ve never seen a bad movie
with her in it. We can all forget MacGruber ever happened.<br /><br />Even with Apatow only producing the film, it still delivers the charm
and relatable characters seen in every one of his films. Besides having
tons of comedy, there always is some sort of human-being essence to
these characters showing them as more than just actors with lines, but
pre-existing characters that are three dimensional. It is almost more
than a movie.<br /><br />Apatow is currently working on an HBO show, which is looking
interesting, called Girls about a group of twenty something females and
their separate lives. It seems like a younger Sex and the City, and if
it keeps the format like Bridemaids, odds are it will be funny and
clever.<br /><br />Bridesmaids proves women can be just a vulgar, obscene, hilarious, and
dirty as men. It is by no means a chick flick, more like a raunchy
comedy with a heart. It lovable even at its most disgusting scenes.
Even the dress fitting scene is hilarious as well as disgusting. It is
one big mix of fun.<br /><br />Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey,
Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O&#x27;Dowd, and Terry Crews. Directed
by: Paul Feig.
