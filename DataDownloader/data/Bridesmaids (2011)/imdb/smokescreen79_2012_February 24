After seeing this movie, or rather after seeing the first five minutes,
both I and my girlfriend concurred that if there was any time there
would be a legitimate reason to slit ones wrists, then it would be
during or after watching this fart in your face movie.<br /><br />What the X$&#x80;!? are people on, to actually enjoy such a worthless waste
of film ? And to be nominated for two Oscars ? Put down your
crack-pipes people!<br /><br />There isn&#x27;t even a valid point to point out the horrible movie-angels
and horrible way it was filmed. How unsympathetic, how hideous and
pathetic this stool smear was. This stank of so much desperation in
trying to make the audience laugh, that it would have been less
embarrassing to try to explain how you ended up jerking off to two
girls and a cup. It sure did feel like you were a cup!<br /><br />Now I&#x27;m not bent on using this kind of language, but I have never seen
a movie that has made me want to travel back in time, to commit suicide
drastically, just so that I would never have to accidentally see this
mentally and emotionally challenged crap of a movie.<br /><br />Now even atheists have reason to believe that there is truly a hell to
watch out for. Drag this out for all eternity and you will never commit
a bad deed for the rest of your life!
