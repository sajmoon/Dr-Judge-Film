First lets get this out of the way...this isn&#x27;t some lezbo, &#x22;chick
flick&#x22; meant to be a response to &#x22;The Hangover Part II&#x22;, as some
moronic comments and reviews seem to imply! Actually, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;
works an all levels and succeeds where &#x22;The Hangover Part II&#x22; fails to.
Whereas &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; delivers a funny script, a great story, a
fabulous cast, &#x22;The Hangover Part II&#x22; feels forced, shallow and
stilted.<br /><br />Kristin Wiig is great and did a fantastic job both in her role and as
the writer of the movie. It soo good to see female comics and writers
score a success for a change, to shut all critics up who for some
insane reason think that women cannot write or direct &#x22;raunchy&#x22;
comedies!!! Ever since &#x22;Away We Go&#x22;, Maya Rudolph has been a revelation
(not that she wasn&#x27;t impressive before). I want to see more of her in
movies, but good smart ones, like &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;, not some crappy
run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.<br /><br />Then there is Rose Byrne...I have a soft spot for her and I have loved
her in &#x22;Damages&#x22;, great acting, just like in &#x22;Adam&#x22; and &#x22;Get Him To The
Greek&#x22; and now &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;. Besides being talented and smart
there is a smouldering sensuality and sexuality just below the surface
if you look carefully and really take her in...ahem OK this is supposed
to be a review not a Danielle Steele novel! LOL Anyways to make a long
story short, I had fun and a lot of laughter watching this movie...so
if you want to pause all the re-boots, sequels and franchise movies,
and have a good time, there is no better way than seeing &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;!
