It&#x27;s been called a chick flick so many times that my husband was
dreading taking me to see it for my birthday. I promised him that by
the end he&#x27;d tell me that he was wrong and that it was one of the
funniest movies he&#x27;d ever seen and NOT just for ladies. As we walked
out of the theater still laughing and quoting lines (as we did the
whole 1 hr drive home) he said &#x22;hunny, you know it hurts me to say this
but...you were right&#x22;. (been waiting 10 yrs to hear that phrase lol).<br /><br />I honestly cannot remember a movie that we laughed so hard at. I would
say the only thing that comes close would be The Hangover. There were
just so many scenes where I was laughing so hard my face and stomach
were hurting and tears were streaming down my face. This one is a BIG
winner in our book. I&#x27;ll be buying the DVD the day it comes out. Now
I&#x27;m just trying to convince my husband we should go see it in the
theater again next weekend lol ;-) Seriously, I cannot say enough good
things about this movie. Go see it!!! You definitely wont regret it!
