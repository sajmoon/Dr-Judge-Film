There should be a film classification which restricts admission to
people UNDER a certain age. In the case of Bridesmaids it should be
restricted to under fifteens. That&#x27;s about the level of humour of this
film. Despite the good reviews it&#x27;s actually a pile of inane,
predictable, juvenile rubbish.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it, but it was just embarrassing. I felt no
sympathy at all for any of the characters. If I enjoyed slapstick and
gutter humour I might have liked it better. Every &#x22;joke&#x22; was stretched
out beyond its limits. Overall, a painful experience.<br /><br />This is a final line of text to get past IMDb&#x27;s silly restriction on
too-short reviews. Bridesmaids is still rubbish.
