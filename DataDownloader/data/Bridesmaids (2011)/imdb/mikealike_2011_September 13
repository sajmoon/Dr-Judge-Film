Definitely, people nowadays are growing more and more different and
apart; otherwise I couldn&#x27;t explain why this movie has so contrasting
reviews on IMDb whilst other movies tend to polarise the opinions. I
found myself wondering how do those who hated it look or feel or think
- maybe it would have been useful if they had offered examples of what
they consider good comedies... Or maybe it&#x27;s just the people involved
in the movie that provoked the rebellious reactions? I did not know who
directed the movie or that Kristen Wii is a SNL regular. And I enjoyed
the movie as it was, not very elaborated but alive, kind in a
surprising way. A zillion kudos to Kristen Wiig - I for one loved her
character! Brought a lot of optimism and compassion in a world obsessed
with perfection, rules, the right look, relationship, job...the right
everything. The gross moments did not seem artificial, one could laugh
at them shamelessly because the action slowly build up to them. And
they were decent, I&#x27;ve seen comedies with out of order icky situations
and it did not feel that bad way here. The character is great: we have
a loser who cannot stop herself from saying the most daring truths in
the face of strangers or friends and who can accept herself and go on
with her life as it is, even when things go from bad to worse. Oh, I
miss the times when people like this roamed free, and they were not
relaxed only if they were stupid enough not to realise how inadequate
they were!The others are also good, kinda cooky but still plausible. I
know: in a particular way, the movie manages to be innocent, fresh,
childish. Which is rare nowadays. Maybe I was heat struck (the negative
reviews really made me wonder), but it sure felt that way to us. I
recommend watching it free of analysis, comparisons and antipathies.
