Chris O&#x27;Dowd (IT Dept geek Roy of &#x22;IT Crowd&#x22;) and Matt Lucas (of
&#x22;Little Britain&#x22;) shine in this story set in Wisconsin delighting their
British fans with scream of laughter and joyful tears. We are so proud
of them - what a great casting!!<br /><br />In terms of the script, I was slightly worried because at first there
are considerably cheapish slapstick gags but as the plot thickens you
see more and more subtle and brilliant humour entwined with physical
comedy with a constantly powerful embracing and compassionate tone
making me laughing and crying at the same time.<br /><br />This would be one of my all-time favourite chick films. I felt utterly
uplifted when I left the cinema near Marble Arch (which was infested by
a not very sophisticated audience as usual).
