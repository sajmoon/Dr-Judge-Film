Producer Judd Apatow often gets criticized for not giving women
significant parts in his films. Well, he can prove those critics wrong
because Bridesmaids, which he produced, shows that women can also be
funny.<br /><br />Bridesmaids stars Kirsten Wiig as Annie, a single and unlucky woman
whose bakery recently went out of business and she also lost her
boyfriend after losing her business. Maya Rudolph is her best friend
Lillian, who has recently gotten engaged and has just chosen Annie to
be her maid of honor. While in the process of getting the wedding
prepared, Annie sees a rival in Helen (Rose Byrne), Lillian&#x27;s new
friend. Whatever Annie tries to do, Helen has to one-up her, driving
Annie mad in the process. Along the way, Annie meets a charming Irish
cop who&#x27;s well played by Chris O&#x27; Dowd (star of a great comedy series
called The IT Crowd). O&#x27; Dowd fits nicely in the role and I hope he
gets more work due to this film&#x27;s success. Now, if there was an MVP
award given to this film, Melissa McCarthy would win it fair and
square. Her role as Megan is hilarious and when she comes on screen,
she makes those moments last and she gets the funniest lines. Kirsten
Wiig (who co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo) is also good and was
better than I expected her to be. Rudolph is also good in the film, as
is Wendi McClendon-Covey (Deputy Johnson on Reno 911!) and Ellie Kemper
(Erin on The Office) as the other bridesmaids. Jon Hamm from Mad Men
has some good scenes here as well as Annie&#x27;s friend with benefits. Like
many of Apatow&#x27;s previous films, there&#x27;s a scene that&#x27;s too good to
mention here and should be seen just to be believed. All I&#x27;ll say is
that it involves Indian food and a bridal store. Some critics may
criticize this scene as being out of place and too raunchy for a movie
like this, but hey, it&#x27;s comedy, it&#x27;s not supposed to be Citizen Kane.
In fact, that&#x27;s the scene that got the most laughs in my theater. It&#x27;s
probably the funniest food regurgitating scene I&#x27;ve seen since Stand By
Me. I also want to give an honorable mention to Jill Clayburgh in her
final film appearance as Annie&#x27;s mom. The relationship between her and
Wiig&#x27;s character works and provides some memorable scenes.<br /><br />Director Paul Feig (creator of Freaks and Geeks) does a good job with
the film. Watching this again recently, it&#x27;s not as funny as the first
time but don&#x27;t let that stop you from enjoying it because there are
still laughs to be had.
