In principle, I believe that young women are as much entitled as their
male counterparts to indulge in sexual fantasy, bathroom humor and
disgusting personal behavior. And, in the Hollywood tradition of
one-bad-(but-financially-successful)-film-deserves-another, there are
reports that studios are planning several films that will travel the
route staked out by &#x22;Bridesmaids.&#x22; Before they do so, I hope the MPAA
will establish a new rating: Z (no one over 50 admitted unless
accompanied by a 20-something, female of questionable taste).<br /><br />Kristen Wiig is a talented comic and there are a few moments in this
movie that are actually funny. But most of the young women with whom
she is surrounded are, like the young men in similar movies,
illustrators of juvenile humor, grown up only in the sense that it
mostly involves sex rather than farting and burping.
