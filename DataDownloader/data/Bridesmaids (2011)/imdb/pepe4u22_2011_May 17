Just came back from this wonderfully funny and well received movie. I
had a chance to watch this movie with the target audience that being a
strong female presence in the audience. What i found was a funny
hilarious movie with that unlying feeling that the character played by
the funny lady from other apatow movie ms wiig. The movie is basic
about an upcoming wedding and the fun with some bridesmaids.. Just go
to this movie and enjoy the experience will bring a lot of laughs and
some tears but a tight and wonderful experience and look for some
slight resemblance to the hangover but with more depth of character. I
loved this movie and it was made better by excellent writing and strong
performances by all
