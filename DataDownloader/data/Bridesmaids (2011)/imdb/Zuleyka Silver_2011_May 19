So what&#x27;s this movie Bridesmaids everyone is talking about? All my
girlfriends were telling me to go see it! And of course I am a huge fan
of SNL&#x27;s Kristen Wiig! Today after lunch my friend and I decided to
catch a matin&#xE9;e for $12.50 at Arclight Sherman Oaks. Can I say best
$12.50 I have ever spent! I mean I am not the kind to laugh at most
jokes, I usually say &#x22;oh that&#x27;s funny&#x22; but never do I laugh out loud,
rarely happens. BRIDESMAIDS HAD ME ROLLING ON MY SEAT! LMFAO! Not a
dull moment/scene! I went through a roller-coaster of emotions;
romantic, hilarious, disgusting, I mean crude! So much more than a
chick flick. I actually saw a couple groups of guys! GO SEE IT! If you
saw it what are your favorite moments, lines?<br /><br />http://zuleykasilver.blogspot.com/2011/05/bridesmaids.html
