I knew this movie would blow after seeing that dismal trailer. And
going into the theatre proved that. The huge problem: Melissa McCarthy.
That unfunny hack just added to the crapiness of this film. Who cares
about the bridesmaids? Didn&#x27;t they show what would happen with Made of
Honor? The jokes are so old, they were first shown when Fred Savage was
still a star. Also what ticks me off is how they tried to pass this off
as &#x22;The Female Hangover&#x22;. No. This is no where near as funny as The
Hangover, it&#x27;s closer to Fool&#x27;s Gold. As soon as those end credits
rolled, i was happy. Never was i as close to death by boredom than when
i watched Duplicity. Avoid this flick. Go see Thor again or Priest. Go
see Fast Five. Hell, you see Madea&#x27;s Big Happy Family Reunion in any
theatres, duck in there. Bridesmaids 1/10
