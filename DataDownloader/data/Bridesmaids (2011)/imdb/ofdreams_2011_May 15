This film has multiple personality disorder. There are some genius
moments and scenes, but they are drowned out by extreme, crass,
predictable, over-the-top scenes full of stale gags. Many honest,
well-written, amazing conversations and lines just float ungrounded in
the wacky framework, or is the wackiness ungrounded in the dramedy
framework??? . . . the honesty and closeness of the main relationship
becomes unbelievable and subsequently the &#x22;realness&#x22; base of the film
loses all credibility. <br /><br />In spite of not enjoying the move overall that much, I think Wiig is a
genius on screen and I hope to see her in something great with a
different writing/directing/producing team.<br /><br />Lastly, I cannot believe Paul Feig directed this! Almost all of what he
has directed and produced demonstrates his mastery of comedy with depth
and nuance, so intelligent and insidious it surprises and wins you
over. Freaks and Geeks is one of the BEST TV shows ever.
