Funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen in my entire life, and I feel sad for the
others who say they&#x27;ve walked out on the movie, because clearly you
have no imagination, and no sense of humor. I could watch this movie
non stop for the rest of my life and never stop laughing. I love the
humor, the disgusting puke, and poop parts are the best, and to say
that IN REAL LIFE people would get fired for the things they did in the
movie, Hello... she does, and also, IT&#x27;S A MOVIE. I&#x27;ve seen E.T. and I
don&#x27;t believe aliens with flashlight fingers exist. Get a sense of
humor, and stop being so uptight. The movie gets an
A+++++++++++++++++++++++++ in my book. :)
