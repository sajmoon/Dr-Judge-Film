Great action movie, No Lame scenes, Some humor with Rock&#x27;s so called
Hit-man, Over all this movie is action packed thriller, with some
graphic killings, and bad as$ fight scenes... Good Flash backs to
understand the past. A must see if you are a Rock fan or just a action
packed shoot em up drive FAST kind of movie watcher !!! Billy bob
Thorton was pretty good as well, how does he get the cool guy roles all
the time and always knocks it out of the park. The hot chick from
Entourage is , well HOT in this as well and again is not disappointing.
There looks like there could be a part 2 with one of the characters
sons, I would be interested in seeing it if they do indeed do it.
