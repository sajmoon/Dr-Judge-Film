Not since Tommy Boy did I laugh out loud so hard. Melissa McCarthy made
this movie. Kristin Wiig is excellent and has more talent than most.
She is confident enough to know not to overplay her character. Most
comedy&#x27;s today are a string of lousy sketches with the hope some type
of theme will emerge...which rarely happens.<br /><br />Bridesmaids scores here with a decent little movie to boot. The
director could have let Maya Rudolph show more of her comedic chops.
She played things well under the radar. Jessica St. Clair nailed the
beauty queen well with fine acting.<br /><br />See this movie...laugh out loud! If you are reading this director (and
you really should) there is NO excuse for a bad movie today. Learn from
the masters...craft a good story and allow your actors to make magic.
We need good comedies in this world!
