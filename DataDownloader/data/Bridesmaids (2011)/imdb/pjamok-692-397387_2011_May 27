Absurd pathetic women, fart, poop, drunk humor that isn&#x27;t even funny.
It is obvious that there is much improv going on as the characters do
not connect at all and some of the conversations between characters
don&#x27;t make much sense or tie to the rest of the film. The gags such as
the engagement party toast go on and on and on and completely lose the
viewer. In real life, people would get arrested and lose their jobs if
they did some of this stuff (especially the cop). The gags end up being
annoying rather than funny.<br /><br />I haven&#x27;t walked out of a movie in decades, but I walked out of this
one. Some of the actors are good, but this movies is an abomination and
a total waste of money. That&#x27;s an hour and half and $7.50 I&#x27;ll never
get back. Awful, awful, awful.
