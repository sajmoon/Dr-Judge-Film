Paul Feig has directed a comedy that will bring you to tears. He has
turned the writings of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo into a side
splitting comedy that just won&#x27;t quit. It is not a &#x22;Chick Flick&#x22; as
many may presume, but it is rather one hilarious scene after another as
I have not seen in many years. The costuming is great. The casting by
Allison Jones is perfect, and the cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is
very effective. I don&#x27;t know if he kept a straight face while filming,
but it must have been a very difficult task. The audience should thank
the producers for providing the audience with a full two hours of fun
and frolic. I doubt that it could have been any better, and more just
like it would be welcome from these truly professional comedians.
Please don&#x27;t make it too long a time before the next sequel, the
audiences are eagerly awaiting another side splitter.
