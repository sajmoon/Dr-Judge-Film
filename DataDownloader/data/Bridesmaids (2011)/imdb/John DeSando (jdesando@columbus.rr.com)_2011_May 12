&#x22;Bridesmaids are like matrimonial interns.&#x22; Conversations with other
Women (2005)<br /><br />Is Bridesmaids a Hangover for chicks? In a small way, yes, but
Bridesmaids is better, even in the scatological scene where a dress
fitting turns into a hilarious disaster as the girls head for the
nearest head. I remember a cruder attempt at fundament fun in Hangover.<br /><br />It&#x27;s all about best friends Annie (Kristen Whig) and Lillian (Maya
Rudolph) preparing for Lillian&#x27;s wedding with Annie as a maid of honor
who is clueless about arranging a wedding. The conflict arises when
another maiden challenges her for best-friend status and maid of honor
honors.<br /><br />Bridesmaids has its share of stereotypes: cute but amorously lost Annie
(Kristin Wiig), plain but lovable affianced Lillian (Maya Rudolph), fat
and randy Megan (Melissa McCarthy), perfectly pretty, wealthy snob
Helen (Rose Byrne), et al. Yet amidst these types we&#x27;ve seen before is
a story of loss and redemption not so heavily attended to in other
Judd-Apatow produced romcoms.<br /><br />Director Paul Feig lets the pathos in when the comedy needs a rest, and
writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo infuse the dialogue with an unusual
intelligence. Unfortunately the of-beat wit ends as the film sags
midway with Annie&#x27;s emotional and amorous problems struggling with
jealousy over Helen&#x27;s high-end bridal arrangements and combat with
selfish lover Ted (Jon Hamm) and blue collar cop Rhodes (Chris O&#x27;Dowd).<br /><br />The film revives with the requisite going-to-Vegas breakout happens
even before the girls get there&#x97;on the plane in some set pieces about
drugs and booze and flight attendants that sure beats Snakes on a Plane
and Airport for a smart mix of slapstick and satire.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is a leap forward for intelligent comedy where characters
overcome stereotypes to be memorable and insightful about the
challenges 30-something women face in a society where their voices are
more frequently heard above the din of dim-witted boy men. <br /><br />But the best was at the beginning when the girls are overcome with bad
food that poisons their dress fitting and provides the best potty
shenanigans ever, spilling over, so to speak, into sink and street.
