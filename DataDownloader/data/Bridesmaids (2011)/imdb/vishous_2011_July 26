2011_July 26 
Last week I was blackmailed into sitting through this chick flick which
I&#x27;d heard (from guys and girls I thought I trusted) was &#x22;hilarious&#x22;,
but the fact that the opening scene almost made me hurl my face off,
paved the way for yet another predictably awful cinema experience. I
sat through the movie secretly making notes on my Android, got home,
sat down to write this review and thought &#x22;where do I start?&#x22; and
that&#x27;s when I realised, &#x22;when suddenly it becomes difficult to write a
review on a movie I hated, I know I&#x27;ve hit an all time favourite&#x22; (or
not, as it may seem).<br /><br />The story basically follows a bride and her bridesmaids as they try and
make it from engagement to marriage and for one reason or another
&#x22;things don&#x27;t pan out the way you&#x27;d expect&#x22; (but actually they do).
Refreshingly though, the bride is not protagonist of this movie its one
of her bridesmaids; personally I&#x27;m bored to death of watching
bridezillas! The trailers do a good job making this squashed bike wreck
look funny &#x96; I smile even now as I watch it again &#x96; oops &#x96; but believe
me when I say those are the only funny moments in the movie.<br /><br />There&#x27;s an uncomfortable silent-but-violent odour of &#x22;the hangover&#x22; all
the way through the movie, the character profiles are roughly the same
(the frustrated married one, the sensible one, the crazy one and the
weird permed one) but throw in rich-lonely-bimbo and closet lesbian and
you basically have 99% of womanhood represented in the movie. The other
hangover whiffs are: the (wannabe) Vegas hen do, stolen puppies&#x27; v
stolen baby, missing bride v missing groom.<br /><br />The acting came across more forced and scripted than an apology from
Bart Simpson; most of the humour (ironically) is toilet humour and why
oh why is there some limp, flaccid love story in mix? (Oh yeah, it&#x27;s a
chick flick). Again, maybe this is a girl thing, but I didn&#x27;t
understand anything the women said, I felt like I was watching a
schizophrenic have a conversation with a pinball machine (maybe my
man-brain just switched off as soon as I heard what I thought were
women nagging). Why did Matt Lucas humiliate himself doing this
gibberish? What was wrong with Chris O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s American/Irish accent?
Was he meant to sound like bipolar, devil possessed Emily Rose with a
speech impediment? By far the worst scene in the movie was the speech
scene, I was cringing so hard I think I think my Buccinator (the muscle
that makes you smile) went into spasm. The best scene in the movie was
the street poo scene &#x96; again, ironic how toilet humour (ie man humour)
got the theatre erupting.<br /><br />Finally, Melissa McCarthy was brilliant! Although her character was
obviously a rip off of Alan from &#x22;the Hangover&#x22; she played it
convincingly and naturally, it&#x27;s no wonder she is doing great
professionally (check out Mike &#x26; Molly and we all know she&#x27;s in Gilmore
Girls too). I personally prefer classy, sweet women, so the filthy
innuendoes didn&#x27;t impress me but all in all she&#x27;s the only thing that
makes the movie bearable. Ultimately, I&#x27;m an open minded guy ergo most
chick flicks I wouldn&#x27;t actively avoid watching, but this is the clear
exception.<br /><br />p.s. I didn&#x27;t even talk about the dumb British girl, endless woo girls,
Rastafarian Father of the bride (huh?) and the Porsche guy (double
huh?)...
