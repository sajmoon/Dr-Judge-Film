I had heard a lot about how great this movie was. After watching it I
am totally disappointed and it irritated me how horrible these women
where portrayed. The maid of honor is a whiny &#x22;poor me&#x22; who can&#x27;t bring
herself to any level of self respect. The best part was when the one
bridesmaid slapped her out of feeling sorry for herself. The
&#x22;beautiful&#x22; bridesmaid was just a self centered b***h. The competition
between the two brings women down to such a low level that it made me
sick!! Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy and not a lesson on how to be
a good person but this went so overboard that I felt little redeeming
qualities in any of the women. There were a few good laughs in the
movie but I would not recommend it at all.
