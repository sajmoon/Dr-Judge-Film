Annie&#x27;s (Kristen Wiig) life spirals into chaos through a cascade of
events spurred by the announcement that her best friend Lillian (Maya
Rudolph) is to get married and she is to be her maid of honour. After
failed business investments and a love-life in self-inflicted permanent
hell (punctuated by masochistic nights spent with her egocentric prick
sex buddy) she seems to have already hit bottom. Only to be proved
entirely wrong, when Lillian&#x27;s work associate, the sumptuous Whitney
(Jessica St. Clair), collides head on with Annie in trying to fulfil
the bridesmaids honours. The remainder of Lillian&#x27;s ragtag team of the
Brides little helpers is made up of foul-mouthing mom of three rascals
Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), goodie-two-shoes Becca (Ellie Kemper) and
tomboy Megan (Melissa Mccarthy), the movies very successful response to
Alan from &#x22;Hangover&#x22;. The entourage is however secondary, as the movie
really and truly focuses on Annie and her debacles with only limited
time offered to the supporting cast.<br /><br />As chaos reigns laughter ensues. Sometimes in droves, but more often
with a little smirk of enjoyment. The movie in the end does turn out to
be a bundle of fun, but it does have a very weird mix of conversation
based humour, subtle absurdities and situational comedy with immature
fart and anal jokes coupled with people thinking that swearing equals
being funny (both these points punctuated by the appearance of Matt
Lucas of Little England ignominy). In the end not everything works in
this slightly chaotic comedy unsure of which direction to best take.
Add to that some some of the key jokes in the movie just dragged on
beyond their expiry date replacing a good laugh with an internal
suggestion for the editor to recut the movie. But after an uneven start
our girls in pink really get going and break inhibitions to force out a
tirade of laughter. The dramatic side of the story is also very well
written, so you feel strongly drawn to sympathise with Annie, whilst
simultaneously screaming at the screen for her being such an emotional
moron. However irritating she is as a person, you somehow end up
gunning for her and happy she found a pastry munching Irish cop to get
romantically involver with.. <br /><br />The ending left me slightly disappointed. Rushed and lacking the warmth
of the build-up it really would have done better with some more minutes
to prepare for the big resolution.<br /><br />Definitely up there with recent comedies such as &#x22;Role Models&#x22; or
&#x22;Hangover&#x22;, but for brief issues with pacing and bad jokes. The movie
also feels way too engineered and sincere for its own good. Being the
response to &#x22;Hangover&#x22; doesn&#x27;t help it one bit in this regard.
