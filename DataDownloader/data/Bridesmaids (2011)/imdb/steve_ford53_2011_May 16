I have heard a comedic film is the most difficult to do and be
successful. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is a film that meets this challenge head on
and pulls it off admirably.<br /><br />Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a down-on-her-luck 30 something who is barely
scraping by after her bakery failed. Her lifelong best friend, Lillian
(Maya Rudolph), gets engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor.
Although honored she is chosen, Annie feels as if her life is on a
rapid decline and Lillian&#x27;s is on the path to success.<br /><br />Determined to do the very best job at planning all of the pre-wedding
activities she arrives at the engagement party and is introduced to the
rest of the bridesmaids. She finds a rival &#x22;Lillian best friend&#x22; in
Helen (Rose Byrne) and the no holds barred competition for Lillian&#x27;s
approval leads to laugh-out-loud antics and situations until Lillian
disappears on the morning of the actual wedding day. Annie and Helen
need to bury the hatchet to find Lillian and hopefully get Lillian &#x22;to
the church on time.&#x22; The remaining bridesmaids, Becca (Ellie Kemper),
Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey) and especially Megan (Melissa McCarthy) are
all funny in their own right and without their contribution the film
would not be as worthwhile. John Hamm, of &#x22;Mad Men&#x22; fame plays Ted,
Annie&#x27;s on again - mostly off again relationship.<br /><br />The film works well and although there are some pretty silly scenes the
overall experience is enjoyable and the whole audience seemed to enjoy
as well.<br /><br />I recommend this film.
