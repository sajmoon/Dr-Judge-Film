Bridesmaids is an extremely crude movie revolving around the life of
Annie(Kristen Wiig)after being selected as the Maid Of Honor by her
best friend Lillian(Maya Rudolph) however when Annie meets Helen(Rose
Byrne), competition ensues between the two and we see Annie&#x27;s life
begin to take a turn for the worst.<br /><br />The movie honestly has a good cast, I was very impressed with the
performances especially Megan(Melissa McCarthy) who was the highlight
of the movie for me, she is hilarious and brought a really good energy
to the cast. My only critique for the acting is Kristen Wiig, she seems
like a bland actress to me, maybe it was just her character but she put
me off for most of the movie. Lillian was a little boring but the rest
of the cast did good jobs with their roles. <br /><br />There were parts of this movie that had you laughing so hard, most of
which was because of Megan and the movies kept a good pace also. The
script I thought was well written, the plot was creative and
entertaining though a little predictable and the casting was excellent
I just wasn&#x27;t really drawn to any of the characters and that made the
movie lack emotional depth.<br /><br />Aside from the movie&#x27;s predictability and the lack of being drawn to
the characters, Bridesmaids is funny and had solid performances from
the cast. If you&#x27;re in the mood for a comedy,check it out
