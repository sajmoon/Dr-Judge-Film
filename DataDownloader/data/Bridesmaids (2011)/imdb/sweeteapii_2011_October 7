At fifty-something, I&#x27;m no spring chicken, and when it comes time&#x97;on
rare occasion&#x97;to go to the movie theater, I want something I can relate
to. Every time I turn around, it&#x27;s another comic book hero or Science
Fiction or droopy no commitment, &#x22;hey we&#x27;re best friends let&#x27;s have
sex&#x22; movie. Hurray! Bridesmaids to the rescue! Being a woman of some
years, I&#x27;ve seen all my friends walk down the plank into matrimonial
bliss. I&#x27;ve done it twice, now, myself...what can I say, I&#x27;m a
statistic. Just the same, there were bits and pieces of Bridesmaids
that hit home. I&#x27;ve been in five bridal parties in my life, and along
with my first marriage (kind of skipped it the second time around), it
makes a half dozen moments of memories. I really enjoyed the movie. I
recommend it to any woman who has been a part of the ritual. It&#x27;s
alleged as the female version of Hangover, but from what I saw of that,
it is totally different. Hangover just seemed like someone pushing the
shock value button while Bridesmaids was a lot deeper. What do you
expect? Women have more substance than men.
