Every time one turns on On Demand recently, he is bombarded with
commercials for this. As with all movies, they splice together the
&#x22;funny&#x22; clips. It seemed like it could be okay. After all, I like
Kristen Wiig. I am favorable to Saturday Night Live alumni.<br /><br />My wife commented that she rented it one evening. The following day I
decided to see if it was still available. Indeed it was. That was quite
unfortunate.<br /><br />The plot just never got going. It had the makings of being good. My
wife commented that it was kind of like the female version of The
Hangover. Except for the laughs. Seriously, this was brutal to watch.<br /><br />I may have gotten a half chuckle once or twice. And that was all.<br /><br />This was a waste of time and money.
