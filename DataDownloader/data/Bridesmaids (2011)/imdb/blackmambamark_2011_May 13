Can women be funny? Sure they can, but only when it&#x27;s under 30 minutes.
I&#x27;m sorry, i know that may sound sexist, but seriously, name me a
female comedy that is made up only of women that is worthy of
remembering? The only thing i can think of is when they roast somebody
on Comedy Central.....hence why, because it&#x27;s under 30 minutes.
Anything after that, always tends to fall into the emotional clich&#xE9;&#x27;
side. Honestly, i&#x27;m rooting for you women....i really am. I want you to
turn this tide.<br /><br />The first half of this movie is comedy at it&#x27;s best. I haven&#x27;t laughed
that hard in a long time. The pace and timing is spot on, very relative
to &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, which is great. However, some of the comedic bits
created this strange uncomfortable vibe between the characters. I know
it was intended to make the scene even more funny, which in a way it
did, but since they did it at almost every turn, after a while it began
to loose some of it&#x27;s luster. But, still funny non the less.<br /><br />So you got a great first half that has everyone in audience geared up
for more laughs.....so you would expect a hilarious finish, right?
Well, once again, they fell back into the cheesy emotional not so funny
clich&#xE9;&#x27; sequence that i hoped would never come. Case in point, take
&#x22;The Hangover&#x22;.....imagine right after Mike Tyson punches Allen, the
guys sit around a mope about how much they have messed things up,
instead of doing other hilarious tid bits. And that is the route this
movie took. Yes, i understand that this is the one for the
ladies......but come on gals. If you want a girl to girl movie, i&#x27;m
sure blockbuster has an entire section dedicated to just that. Let&#x27;s
bring something new to the table. Prove that you can be funny all the
time and not so emotional.<br /><br />Bottom Line......the movie started out with a bang, and looked very
promising.....but then it slowly morphed into a giant clich&#xE9;&#x27; trap. I&#x27;m
sorry, but if you want me to buy your comedy, don&#x27;t include a sequence
where a girl bakes a cake that says &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry&#x27; on it.....sorry, i know
i spoiled a little bit of it, but now you know what to expect, because
that&#x27;s exactly what this movie turns into. It goes from hilarious
comedy to cheesy chick flick. So is it bad? No, not really......but, it
could have been so much more.
