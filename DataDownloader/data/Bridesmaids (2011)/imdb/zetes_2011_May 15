Kristen Wiig stars and co-writes this Judd Apatow-produced film. It&#x27;s
billed as a raunchy, female-centric comedy, sort of a girly Hangover
(which I&#x27;m sure was the original pitch), but it&#x27;s far better than one
might expect from that description. There&#x27;s a real story here, with
very well written characters. And, while it&#x27;s absolutely hilarious when
it wants to be, the pathos Wiig wants you to feel for the characters
works. Wiig plays a hopeless woman in her mid-thirties. She has
recently lost her bakery, as well as her boyfriend. The only attention
she gets from men now is from a heartless prick (John Hamm) who just
wants her as a friend with benefits. She&#x27;s further hurt when her best
friend (Maya Rudolph) announces that she&#x27;s engaged.<br /><br />Wiig is chosen as the maid of honor, but she finds that she&#x27;s in direct
competition with Rudolph&#x27;s other close friend, Rose Byrne, who is
wealthy and can provide Rudolph with a lot of things that Wiig (who
works as a saleswoman in a jewelry store) could not. The other
bridesmaids are played by Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911), Ellie
Kemper (of The Office) and Melissa McCarthy (of Mike and Molly). Their
pre-wedding adventures generally end with Wiig screwing everything up.
Chris O&#x27;Dowd (of The IT Crowd) has a nice role as a police officer who
gets involved with Wiig. Yeah, it&#x27;s a predictable romance, but O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s
character is well written and he&#x27;s very funny and charming. The romance
actually develops quite naturally. Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s final role is as
Wiig&#x27;s goofy but understanding mother. McCarthy, a very large and
confident woman, is probably the breakout performer of the film.
Everything she says and does in the movie is a riot.<br /><br />Wiig may be playing a character that she&#x27;s played before on Saturday
Night Live and in many of her film appearances, but it&#x27;s still
perfectly funny. And with the great writing backing the character, I&#x27;d
say the performance is quite excellent. Byrne, who could easily have
become a harpy, is given several small details that give us an insight
into her character (most notably her two step-kids, who hate her). The
film is almost cursed with too many great characters. McLendon-Covey
and Kemper pretty much disappear at a certain point of the film, which
is unfortunate. McLendon-Covey, in particular, is hilarious when
describing her three foul-mouthed, chronically masturbating sons. There
are also several non-speaking roles played by people comedy buffs will
recognize, like Tim Heidecker (of Tim &#x26; Eric fame) as Rudolph&#x27;s
husband-to-be, Lynne Marie Stewart (who plays Charlie Day&#x27;s mom on It&#x27;s
Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Rudolph&#x27;s mother, and Nancy Carell
(n&#xE9;e Walls, Stephen Carell&#x27;s wife and former Daily Show correspondent)
and Melanie Hutsell (whom I haven&#x27;t seen since the mid-90s when she was
on SNL) play Byrne&#x27;s and Wiig&#x27;s tennis partners in one great sequence.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn&#x27;t like in the film was John Hamm&#x27;s role,
which is far too two-dimensional compared to everyone else. He feels
like he&#x27;s in a much broader comedy (I think Wiig just wanted to share a
goofy sex sequence with him; by the way, between this movie and
MacGruber, Wiig is the queen of the awkward sex sequence). Director
Paul Feig is best known as the creator of the classic dramedy series
Freaks and Geeks, and he&#x27;s directed for pretty much every great comedy
series of the past decade and a half, including Arrested Development,
30 Rock, The Office and Parks &#x26; Recreation, so you should know you&#x27;re
in great hands there.
