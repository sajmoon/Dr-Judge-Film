When I first heard about this movie and saw who was involved with it, I
thought it might actually be decent. After constantly seeing previews,
I started to lose hope. It just didn&#x27;t seem funny to me. Then the
reviews started coming in and everybody seemed to love it. It was
constantly being compared to &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. I didn&#x27;t particularly like
&#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, so I still didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up, but I
figured I might as well check it out. I must say, I was wrong. This
kicked &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;&#x27;s ass and then made it sit in a corner wearing a
dunce cap.<br /><br />Not only is this movie packed with double the laughs of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;,
it&#x27;s actually got some heart. Instead of just being a bunch of random
gimmicks thrown together for cheap laughs, this movie has honest
characters who are doing honestly funny things. Just when you feel like
it&#x27;s about to slip into absurd comedy, it gets a little bit heartfelt.
But then when you feel maybe it&#x27;s going to get a bit preachy it gets
back to absurd comedy, without feeling unbalanced.<br /><br />Every single person in the cast was funny. Kristen Wiig, who I&#x27;ve been
getting kind of sick of on SNL, was hilarious and gave a shockingly
genuine performance. But the nicest surprise came from Melissa
McCarthy. Everyone was raving about her, but I just found her obnoxious
in the trailer. Yet again, I was wrong. In the movie, she gets some
great laughs and even she has a few touching scenes.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that in a year where most of the comedies have been
less than mediocre, I missed half of the dialogue because I couldn&#x27;t
hear it over the laughter of the audience in my theatre. I went in
wanting to hate this movie, but it truly was great.
