Help! I may be losing my sense of humour, which I fear. While many have
found The Hangover and its Part 2 really funny, somehow I&#x27;d hardly
classify them as really being comedies of their respective years since
there are padded moments that doesn&#x27;t do the story any good, while at
times having scenes which were really engineered and came across quite
artificially. The same goes for Bridesmaids, widely touted to be the
female version of that Todd Philips directed series, and in the same
vein, suffered a similar fate in having the expected play out as they
should, and nothing more.<br /><br />Not that I&#x27;m expecting rocket science, but the story does indeed take a
leaf out of The Hangover, borrowing its basic setting of an impending
wedding, coupled with a celebrity finale that is as formulaic as how
most wedding dinners here are conducted - you get the fanfare
introduction of the appetizers, before a rather bland main course
topped off by noodles or rice, followed by desserts before everyone
forms a beeline for the doors.<br /><br />Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, the latter /who also stars as
the leading character Annie, this film could have been labelled as a
singular rather than a plural entity, given varying degrees of screen
time granted to the rest of the entourage. Annie is that neurotic woman
who cannot seem to get her act together, being a flop in her
confectionery business, a flop at her sales work, in total disarray for
having entered into a f*ck buddy relationship with a rich playboy, and
in arrears with her apartment rental. We only know that she&#x27;s best
friends forever with the bride to be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) and has
been tasked as the maid of honour, which is where the whole film
revolves around.<br /><br />Not. Despite its wedding theme, there is only a handful of scenes
related to the run up to a wedding, such as the fitting out for gowns
in an expensive shop which provided some of the best scenes in the
film, a bridal shower and of course the expected finale for a film like
this. The rest of the scenes felt like glue, being there piece the
disparate scenes together so that it can flow from joke to joke. On the
jokes front, there&#x27;s a good mix of verbal jousting and slapstick, which
came complete with the obligatory toilet humour, and plenty of potty
mouthed characters who think that swearing equates to funny. Obviously
some worked while others tanked, with brilliant ideas all utilized in a
single setting, leaving mediocre ones to prop up the rest, which was a
pity.<br /><br />The real crux of the film, one which actually made me appreciate and
enjoy this a lot more, is its theme of the rich and poor divide given
the presence of Helen (Rose Byrne) as the antagonist, being extremely
loaded, and for reasons to be unveiled which had nothing to do with
Lillian&#x27;s wedding, if at all, having set up to be Annie&#x27;s chief rival
to be well received, and recognized as Lillian&#x27;s BFF. It addresses how
sometimes money can be used to buy emotions, affections, friendships
and all things superficial, but when it comes to the crunch, nothing
beats sincerity and a keen interest without having baggage such as
ulterior motives. Sure there were a couple of engineered scenes to
bring this up in not so subtle terms, but I guess when used in the
context of weddings from the female perspective, meaningful things can
be built without the need to always resort to material wealth, though
of course the latter, together with personal connections, sometimes
help, and that&#x27;s the ugly truth.<br /><br />Surprisingly the story was allowed to wander all over the place, to
allow Annie to get involved romantically with a cop (Chris O&#x27;Dowd)
naturally in contrast to her f*ck buddy, but also to provide some comic
relief no matter how brief those moments actually became. I suppose no
flick chick can entirely omit this aspect in a film with the absence of
that proverbial Prince Charming type, so O&#x27;Dowd served the purpose
complete with his Irish accent used to sound exotic and to provide a
very small talking point in the film. A trip to Las Vegas got set up as
well but for all the fanfare expectation, everything got centered
around the airplane journey which was included in the trailer, and
somehow overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />If only the film had avenues to bring in the other bridesmaids,
especially Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey into the picture, it
would have been more inclusive since they won&#x27;t fade away as
unimportant, disposable caricatures. Even Melissa McCarthy had it lucky
to have a jarring, comeback moment of sorts to engage the audience
directly, being the equivalent of Zach Galifianakis in his turn in The
Hangover though less annoying, to literally slap some sense to the
protagonist and preach ideals and values to the audience out there.
It&#x27;s a pep talk alright about self confidence and self pity, mildly
amusing though not contributing much to the story anyhow.<br /><br />Still, the film lived up to its marketing billing of The Hangover
equivalent for the female crowd, and it shows, despite venturing into
gross out territory centered in and around a bridal shop, which
personally contained the best moments of the film. Call me crass but at
least my laughter was sustained in that setting alone. Recommended.
