As raunchy as any female flick could bear, BRIDESMAIDS is not just a
female version of THE HANGOVER spin-off. It hinges firmly on a 3S
lady&#x27;s (single, seventies and stuck) personal mire, and elaborates a
watchable diagram of friendship and, eventually a tad of love. <br /><br />The film manages a tug-of-war competition between our protagonist Annie
Walker as her childhood BFF Lillian&#x27;s maid of honor and an almost
immaculate bridesmaid Helen (a new friend of Lillian) to the coronet of
the best friend of the bride, the battle is inequitably brutal since
Helen&#x27;s filthy rich and such a phony, thus soon it plummets into a
steep plight for Annie. However a fairly anticipated buck-up is
congenially under the way, so no more melodrama and a woman&#x27;s victory
is all well-deserved. <br /><br />The film is a tailor-made vehicle for Kristine Wiig (who co-writes the
script) and her comedic bent has grabbed the best platform to bloom and
it is an awesome job! The hysterical turmoil of her life is
surprisingly conceived with humor and self-mockery. Among the sidekicks
Melissa McCathy is another feat on screen, her embodiment of life with
her own weight is the best part in the film and expunges extensively
the side effect of a hackneyed plot contrivance. Also Wiig&#x27;s Saturday
NIGHT LIVE co-star Maya Rudolph and an inscrutably dulcet Rose Byrne
are adeptly cast. The great news is that the film has become the
highest grossing R-rated female comedy of all time in USA, while a sad
thing is that it is Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s final film. <br /><br />It is also another triumph for the producer Judd Apatow (after the
tepid welcome of FUNNY PEOPLE 2009), he is still able to pioneer the
red-hot craze for the modern-day comedy and be innovative, I hope
BRIDESMAIDS 2 will not be a disheartening cool-down as THE HANGOVER
PART II (2011) did.
