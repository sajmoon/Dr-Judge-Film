2011_July 2 
I went to watch a screening of the new comedy bridesmaids with very
high expectations and I can easily say that this has been one of the
best films I have ever watched. I&#x27;m usually not into comedies, but this
film made me laugh out loud several times and can&#x27;t wait for it to come
out on D.V.D. Previous reviews I have read raved about it, dubbing it
as the female Hangover, so I am very happy that it was as good as I had
hoped it would be.<br /><br />The characters were all brilliant, the script was entertaining and best
of all this film proved that girls can be just as bad as boys. Not only
this, but actress Melissa McCarthy also deserves credit for her
fantastic role as Megan, who will have you in stitches with her
brilliantly funny mishaps and disasters during the film. I am delighted
to say that this is a brilliant film and one of the best I&#x27;ve seen for
a long time!
