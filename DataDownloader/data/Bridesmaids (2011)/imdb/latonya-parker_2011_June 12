Must see. This movie is the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen in years. We
laughed so hard until we were screaming and crying!! I loved every
second of this film. You MUST go and see this movie. I usually don&#x27;t
watch movies twice but I am taking my mother 2 go and see this movie.<br /><br />It was hilarious all of the way thru. Never a dull moment only sheer
humor. They could not have selected a better cast. The bride and the
bride mate were pure comedy. Unlike other movies who try to be funny,
this one just flows. You can tell that the writers had a great since of
what they wanted. The director did a great job as well. <br /><br />Again, you must go and see this film. I am so ready for a part two.
