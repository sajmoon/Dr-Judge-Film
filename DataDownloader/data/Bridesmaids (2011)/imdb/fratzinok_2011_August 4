I was worried because the reviews were so good, and sometimes when
expectations are high going in, you are disappointed! But this was not
the case here!!! This movie was hilarious from beginning till end!!!
Kristen was awesome, believable, relate-able. Melissa Mc Carthy stole
the show for sure!!! This movie was over 2 hours, but it did not seem
too long at all. There was never a dull moment! I saw this twice, once
with girlfriends and once with my husband and another couple. The
second time, my friend&#x27;s husband was laughing louder than any woman in
the theater!! There is raunchy jokes, potty humor and language in this
film. If you are not into that, you may not enjoy this! Personally I
loved it and would could watch this again and again!!!
