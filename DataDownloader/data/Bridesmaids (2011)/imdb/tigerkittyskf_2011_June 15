The past decade has just been awful for Hollywood. The latest movies
that have come out have had the same plot, only just with different
actors and characters. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that I won&#x27;t even waist
my time or money on going to see a movie at the theater anymore, simply
because I know what&#x27;s going to happen just by watching the trailer.
But, this movie was a breath of fresh air! Bridesmaids was jam packed
full of sight gags and slap stick comedy! Almost every line was joke
and it kept you laughing right through to the end.<br /><br />Usually in every movie you have an actor that either doesn&#x27;t fit their
part or they just plain suck. The casting director for this movie has
done their job and done it well! I didn&#x27;t notice a single actor that
didn&#x27;t fit their part. Everyone was exceptional.<br /><br />I usually don&#x27;t give movies more than 7 out of 10 stars, but this movie
was thoroughly entertaining and has EARNED 9 stars! <br /><br />Overall, awesome movie!
