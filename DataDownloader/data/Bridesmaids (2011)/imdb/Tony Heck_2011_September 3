&#x22;Why can&#x27;t you be happy for me and then go home and talk about me
behind my back like a normal person?&#x22; After being asked to be the maid
of honor to her friend Lillian (Rudolph), Annie&#x27;s (Wiig) life that is
already in disarray becomes even more so. After thinking she is being
replaced as best friend she tries too hard to compensate. Almost
ruining the wedding in the process. This movie has what I call the &#x22;Due
Date&#x22; or &#x22;Hangover&#x22; curse. Like those movies, the first people to see
it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is
great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long
and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in
thinking this is the female &#x22;Hangover&#x22; I was excited. While I can see
the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While
this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn&#x27;t as good as
expected. Overall, this is a good movie, but because of the
expectations I had I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I thought. I give it a
B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might, just to see if it&#x27;s better the second
time.<br /><br />*Also try - Something Borrowed &#x26; The Sweetest Thing
