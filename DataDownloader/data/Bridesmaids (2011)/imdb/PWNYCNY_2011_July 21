The problem with this movie is that the lead roles went to the wrong
actors. This movie should have starred Melissa McCarthy and Ben
Falcone. They were incredibly funny! The other cast members were not.
Every scene with Ms. McCarthy was hilarious, especially the bathroom
scene which she stole. As for the story itself, the conflict between
the two bridesmaids was completely contrived, seemed to be almost
tragic and not particularly funny. The actors were not funny and indeed
there were moments when Maya Rudolph seemed like she was going to cry.
Now if Melissa McCarthy had played the main bridesmaid and Ben Falcone
her boyfriend, then the movie would have been a farce and would have
generated a lot more laughs, but so much for &#x22;what if.&#x22; Anyway, the
movie has a lot of raunchy humor which required raunchy actors, and
with the exception of Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Falcone, the raunchy actors
were not there.
