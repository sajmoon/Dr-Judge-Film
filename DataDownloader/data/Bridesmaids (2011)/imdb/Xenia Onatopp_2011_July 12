So I saw this with my mom, which is the perfect person to see it with.
As this movie encompasses nothing more than an uncomfortable intro, a
warming middle section, and an &#x22;I have a cramp from laughing&#x22; ending.<br /><br />From the beginning scenes you couldn&#x27;t really tell if you would enjoy
this film or be suffering through 2+ hours of I want to be funny but I
am not really! The best friend chemistry between Maya Rudolph and
Kristian Wiig was hard to find. Despite this however, out of no where
you find yourself smiling. And it turns out that smile was the movie
stretching your face muscles for some strong laughs that last through
out the film. The film follows in the tradition of the &#x22;Hang Over,&#x22;
&#x22;Wedding Crashers,&#x22; and &#x22;40 year Old Virgin.&#x22; But it stands on it own
by presenting a strongly funny all female cast that could be the
beginning of a new comedic voice(Kristin Wigg). Just wish it could have
been about a 1/2 hour shorter.
