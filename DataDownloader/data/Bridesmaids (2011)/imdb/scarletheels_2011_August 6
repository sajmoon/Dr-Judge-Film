Annie (Kristen Wiig), a down-and-out woman who&#x27;s lost her business and
boyfriend, is invited to be her childhood friend&#x27;s (Lillian, played by
Maya Rudolph) Maid of Honor. Coordinating the wedding is the insanely
rich and pretentious wife of the bride&#x27;s husband&#x27;s boss, Helen (Rose
Byrne), who from the get-go, tirelessly competes for Lillian&#x27;s
attention. In the mix are Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a housewife who
is desperate to escape the confines of suburbia, Becca (Ellie Kemper),
a clueless newlywed, and Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the groom&#x27;s crass
sister. The subtle rivalry between Annie and Helen eventually backfires
on the both of them and it&#x27;s up to the two adversaries to put aside
their differences in order to save the big day.<br /><br />One of the more hyped-up movies of 2011, Bridesmaids is marketed as a
raunchy, female version of The Hangover, which is understandable but
unnecessarily deceiving. The only correlation between the two is an
impending marriage. This is less about the bridesmaids and more about
about its central character, Annie, a self-loathing, loveless character
who projects her negative attitude on to anyone who has the misfortune
to cross paths with her. They include customers in the jewelry store
she works at, Nathan (Chris O&#x27;Dowd), the baby-faced cop she ends up
romancing, and her own best friend. At times, Annie is difficult to
empathize with because she&#x27;s such a destructive force. She&#x27;s so intent
on sabotaging herself that she loses her job and drives away a man who
only wants to see her succeed and be happy.<br /><br />You may not realize it right away but Bridesmaids is a chick flick
that&#x27;s been made palpable for men with some raunchy (though implied)
humor and the really funny comedic relief of Melissa McCarthy. Kristen
Wiig shows quite a bit of restraint, to the point where I wondered if
this is the same ham of Saturday Night Live fame. I was disappointed,
especially during the airplane scene, which was her moment to shine. It
seemed like such a wasted opportunity, both for Wiig and her fans.
Whether this was her choice or the director&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t know. McLendon-
Covey and Kemper receive limited screen time, as does John Hamm, who
plays Wiig&#x27;s boorish, inconsiderate &#x27;fuck buddy&#x27;.<br /><br />Besides McCarthy, O&#x27;Dowd and Byrne deserve pats on the backs for their
performances. O&#x27;Dowd may seem out of place with his Irish accent but he
manages to infuse some much needed positive energy. He&#x27;s silly and
lovable with amusing observations about life and his law enforcement
profession. My favorite was the quip about the ugly carrot in every bag
(and I just ate it). Byrne as the gorgeous, impeccably groomed trophy
wife was perfectly cast, as well.<br /><br />The film clocks in at two hours and five minutes, thanks to jokes
getting stretched well past their expiration. I like Kristen Wiig but
her writing, especially the dialog, doesn&#x27;t always gel. Sometimes, it&#x27;s
obvious a scene exists solely to showcase herself as &#x27;the emerging
female comedian&#x27; yet she never fully satisfies. Other times, the banter
between characters is so unrealistic and outrageous that it&#x27;s no longer
humorous but outright awkward to watch. I squirmed more during the
jewelry store scenes than I did during the much talked about diarrhea
outbreak. Kristen Wiig is no Tina Fey but I don&#x27;t hold that against
her.
