Bridesmaids directed by Paul Feig, written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen
Wiig.<br /><br />Starring Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie
Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, and Chris O&#x27;Dowd.<br /><br />Let me start by saying expectations for this film were pretty high, and
they were met to a certain degree. Bridesmaids is a fairly entertaining
film, with several funny moments but also several WTF one&#x27;s as well.<br /><br />The basic plot is that of Annie a woman who lost not only her boyfriend
but also all of her savings. She then finds that she has been picked as
her best friend&#x27;s maid of honor, where she finds herself working
through some weird rituals alongside a group of bridesmaids.<br /><br />This film has some nice direction (alongside other things) and some
funny moments. It&#x27;s pretty impressive considering the fact that this is
Kristen Wiig&#x27;s first leading role (I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s very funny on
SNL), and there&#x27;s some funny moments from other members of the cast
(especially Jon Hamm in a cameo as Ted a man that Annie has a sexual
relationship with).<br /><br />One note of interest is that this is Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s final film (the
actress that played Annie&#x27;s mother). Not the best way to end your
career, if you ask me.<br /><br />Overall a pretty good time.
