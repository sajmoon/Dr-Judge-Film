2011_November 2 
Of my entire DVD collection, there are only a handful of romantic
comedies because, no offense to fans of the genre, most of them are
total crap. Predictable, corny, and shallow&#x85;I would rather suffer
through a Uwe Boll marathon than watch the average romantic comedy.
Leave it to producer Judd Apatow and rising star Kristen Wiig to
actually make a romantic comedy worth watching. It&#x27;s a chick flick that
despite it&#x27;s themes of female friendship/bonds, weddings, and
relationships, is still funny enough for men to enjoy. Any doubts in my
mind were erased when I saw this film in theaters and a scene was so
disgusting that it caused a group of elderly women who didn&#x27;t know what
they were getting into to leave the theater muttering about how filthy
the movie is (for the record, it was the infamous dress shopping/food
poisoning scene). The movie follows the character of Annie (Wiig) as
her life essentially falls apart around her. She hates her job, lives
with a pair of obnoxious roommates, and the closest thing she has to a
relationship is &#x22;no strings attached&#x22; sex with a man who laughs at the
thought of an actual relationship. She holds on well enough until her
best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces that she&#x27;s gotten engaged.
Of course, Annie is going to be her maid of honor but there appears to
be some competition in the form of Lillian&#x27;s new friend/wife of her
fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s boss, Helen (Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, tasteful, and
impeding on Annie&#x27;s territory. As the wedding draws near, the two butt
heads over everything from the dresses to the wedding shower, but there
can be only one&#x85;wait, wrong movie.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig deserved this movie. She&#x27;s one of the best talents to come
from SNL in recent years and she&#x27;s provided some hilarious supporting
performances movies like MACGRUBER and PAUL. This movie is her chance
to be a leading woman and she knocks it out of the park. I love the
awkwardness Wiig infuses into her characters; her character feels
really genuine in this movie. She&#x27;s struggling to get by and luck just
isn&#x27;t on her side. She means well as she tries to help Lillian plan her
wedding but her plans just turn into disaster, and Helen is there to
take advantage of every misstep. I feel like I&#x27;ve seen Rose Byrne has
been everywhere lately; I know I&#x27;ve got at least 2-3 other films she&#x27;s
been in this year. No complaints though, because she&#x27;s great. She&#x27;s
proved her comedic chops in GET HIM TO THE Greek and she continues her
excellent work here. She&#x27;s snotty, overbearing, and self-centered
without coming off as a caricature. And then there&#x27;s the A+ supporting
cast giving their best here: former SNL alum Maya Rudolph, Wendi
McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper. Melissa McCarthy stands out as
probably the funniest bridesmaid in the crew. She&#x27;s been compared a lot
lately to being the Zach Galifianakis of the BRIDESMAIDS team and it&#x27;s
pretty accurate. She&#x27;s the schlubby, socially inept goofball of the
group and steals most scenes. Finally, there&#x27;s Chris O&#x27;Dowd and Jon
Hamm as Annie&#x27;s love interests and opposite ends of a spectrum, both
providing some great laughs (especially Hamm).<br /><br />Earning almost $300 million worldwide, BRIDESMAIDS was a blatant
success and proves that romantic comedies don&#x27;t have to be
mass-produced from the same mold. I&#x27;m hoping the cash this movie banked
will convince filmmakers to put some creative energy into future
rom-coms instead of flooding the market with cheap garbage. I&#x27;m glad to
see Kristen Wiig getting so much attention from this film and I hope
that means she&#x27;ll be getting more leading roles in the future. This
movie is hilarious and has a lot of feeling behind it. If there is a
comedy where men and woman can come together and both enjoy it, it&#x27;s
this one.
