This is like a big slap in the face to all the lame chick flicks out
there as of now and a breakthrough, star making leading role for the
brilliant and hilarious Kristen Wiig. I have never seen a comedy in a
long time that was as consistently funny and I mean laugh on the ground
with tears coming down your face funny as well as touching and for once
genuine characters that you can relate to and have an instant,
believable, bond and chemistry on screen that makes the ongoing crazy
shenanigans all the more effective and hysterical. The showstopper,
scene stealing, laugh riot Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and no wonder
has her own sitcom and she should host or be apart of SNL or something
she is so freaking funny I almost wet myself! Maya Rudolph and Kristen
Wiig should make more comedies together and are much better than Tina
Fey and Amy Poehler were in Baby Mama, they are a comedy dream team and
the rest of the cast is the cherry on top. The movie goes through
typical issues from the average chick flick like jealousy,
insecurities, narcissism, cat fights, self-doubt, self-pity,
self-destruction you name it but it deals with those is a more honest,
realistic non sugar-coated way that was refreshing and smart from the
norm and raises the bar so high for chick flicks (which is more anti of
that anyways) and comedies in general that I personally can&#x27;t see any
comedy this year or in the future surpassing its comedy greatness, it&#x27;s
golden!!! Overall if you were waiting for a movie that will truly make
you laugh harder than you ever laughed before in the theaters in a long
time your wish has been granted, wear depends just in case because you
might need them. Highly Recommended! The most satisfying comedy in the
past decade that I never wanted it to end and forget about the
overrated The Hangover and its unnecessary sequel and bring on
Bridesmaids 2 already! 4.5 out of 5 stars.
