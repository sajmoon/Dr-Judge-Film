This movie is hilarious fun. My wife drags me to one chick flick a year
in the theater, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s this one. Considering the talent
involved, I expected something more than meets the eye after seeing the
trailer. However, I was not expecting such a hysterical experience.
This is a chick flick for dudes... the anti-chick flick &#x22;chick flick&#x22;
if you will.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie is that although you get a sense of the
heart and charm, it&#x27;s not afraid to pull any punches just because the
characters are female (the scene in the bridal shop will be the topic
of much discussion, I assure you). I also loved the cast, lead by the
always awesome Kristen Wiig. She was perfect in this role and I hope
she does more work like this. She can make me pee my pants with
laughter, and then straighten me right back up in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />I also loved the pacing of most of the film. Several scenes had just
the right amount of awkwardness or pause or &#x22;beat&#x22; that really added an
extra element of hilarity. There were several of those scenes where the
audience was collectively cracking up, almost violently so. People were
wiping tears from their eyes and still relaying jokes back and forth to
one another as they filed out of the theater.<br /><br />Anyway, guys, trust me.. make this the &#x22;chick flick&#x22; you surprise your
girl with and take her to the theater. You won&#x27;t regret it.
