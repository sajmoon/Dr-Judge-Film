Judd Apatow and Kristen Wiig bring their hilarious minds to the test,
and they have accomplished to make the first ever &#x27;rated-R&#x27; chick flick
comedy. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is an example of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; with female
actors, and it&#x27;s what I would call it: &#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22; meets
&#x22;Superbad&#x22;. Saturday Night Live&#x27;s Kristen Wiig, plays her first feature
film role, as Annie, a thirty-something who recently failed to make her
bakery, is living in an apartment with lazy siblings, and has a sexual
relationship with Jon Hamm. But anyways, her best friend Lillian,
portrayed by Maya Rudolph, is getting engaged and asks Annie to be her
maid of honor. Then, it afterward leads into hilarious situations,
where Annie and bridesmaid Helen, portrayed by Rose Byrne, are jealous
of each other&#x27;s friendship with Lillian. So, the whole movie just talks
about the misadventures of bridesmaids, until the big wedding day.
&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; happens to be one of the best Judd Apatow comedies ever,
and it sure has its moments. From an unexpected food poisoning, to
Kristen Wiig drunk on an airplane, and some good old-fashioned raunchy
humor. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo provided a well-written script
filled with raunchiness, which is a good idea for a chick flick. The
cast is so perfect, that I have to explain each one personally. Wiig
and Rudolph have their most hilarious and touching moments in the film,
Rose Byrne is a beautiful actress that portrayed the role perfectly,
Jon Hamm was a little annoying, Chris O&#x27; Dowd makes clever optimism in
his portrayal, but it&#x27;s Melissa McCarthy that stole the entire show
with such raunchy humor, and a performance filled with deserving
laughs. Now, in mixed thoughts, the movie is such a long 2-hour comedy,
the entire second act took to long to develop, and some characters were
too annoying. But even though &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is so long, and has
hilarious material that makes people gag, it&#x27;s worth watching this
excellent comedy for the unique script, and clever cast. Seriously,
watching this movie over and over, can still make you laugh every
single time. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a hilarious, and deserving
chick flick&#x22;.
