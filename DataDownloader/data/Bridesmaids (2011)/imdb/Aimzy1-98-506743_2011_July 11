I thought this film was hilarious and I would definitely go and see it
again or buy the DVD as i was laughing all the time and also found it
good in the way that it is a chick flick, and my boyfriend also found
it really good! I found the simple jokes funny... And was laughing
every two minutes! I am a movie fanatic and would definitely love to
add this to my collection at home! <br /><br />I think all actors were chosen well, especially Megan! She is a well
known actor and so is Anne which made it all the more fun to watch and
relate to other films they have taken part in. I also appreciated that
it wasn&#x27;t very predictable! Therefore you were constantly watching and
laughing at new things.
