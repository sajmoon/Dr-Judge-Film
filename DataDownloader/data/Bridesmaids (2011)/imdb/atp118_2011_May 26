Im going to start right off the bat and say i liked this more than the
original Hangover. For everyones information i am a male in my mid
20&#x27;s. When i went to see this i was convinced it was a Chick Flick and
that it was the womens version of hangover. Wow was i completely wrong.
I saw this movie with a couple of my buddies and some girls we were
with. I was laughing out loud the entire movie and everyone in the
audience was as well. Their were some moments in the film i was crying
of laughter. I&#x27;ll take the cast of bridemaids over the cast of hangover
in a second. The movie itself has a great plot and great characters.
The last time i remember laughing out loud in a theater was when i saw
wedding crashers. I&#x27;ll put this movie in my top ten comedies of all
time.
