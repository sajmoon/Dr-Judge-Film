I generally rate the movie and do not write a review. But today I am
taking this pain only to save the precious time of as many people as
possible. If you are a single girl around 27, this movie will depress
you. And the depression is like a slow injection ! Then the gags are so
unfunny that they annoy the hell out of you. Some scenes are over
lengthy and totally non-sense. And on the top of that, the main lead
actress is very very ugly, so ugly that she becomes pain to the eyes.
At least in this movie. She is the main lead and you are portraying her
to be an absurd woman with no self-respect. In fact, many characters
are unnecessary. You make a movie for adults and you expect them to
laugh at potty humor, drunk humor, long sequences! Sorry, that&#x27;s not
possible. Please don&#x27;t watch. IMDb doesn&#x27;t allow me to write a short
review so I had to write extra.
