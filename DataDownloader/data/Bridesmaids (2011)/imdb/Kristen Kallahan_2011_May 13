And this movie was aimed at me -- I&#x27;m a woman and I&#x27;m into comedy. I
expected to have a good time. I didn&#x27;t. It just never got funny. A lot
of &#x22;almost funny&#x22; scenes. A few chuckles. But we deserve better than
that.<br /><br />A great cast wasted. The heroine is unlikeable. I don&#x27;t understand how
you write a script for yourself and make yourself unlikeable from every
aspect. <br /><br />Her big &#x22;blow-up&#x22; scene (intended to be hilarious) just makes you
cringe. Shut up and be gracious for your friend, the bride&#x27;s, sake.
Don&#x27;t make it all about you.<br /><br />The only actor who got good laughs from the audience was Melissa
McCarthy (&#x22;Mike &#x26; Molly&#x22;). <br /><br />But her character is another head-scratcher. She seems to be a butch
lesbian. Yet lusts after men. So many things just didn&#x27;t make sense
about this movie. And you get distracted thinking &#x22;Why does the
Wisconsin highway patrol officer have a British accent?&#x22; &#x22;Is that rich
lady a bitch or not?&#x22; &#x22;Why is that lesbian coming onto that man?&#x22; &#x22;Just
what is the main character&#x27;s problem? Is she mentally ill?&#x22; None of
this is helpful to a comedy.
