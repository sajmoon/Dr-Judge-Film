The Hollywood summer has dawned upon us and the first set of movies has
been predictably thrust upon us with loads of sequels along with the
much anticipated sequel of Hangover 2. Hangover 2 will be a subject of
discussion in next week&#x27;s review. But currently among the crop of
movies released is an apparent chick flick called &#x27;Bridesmaid&#x27;, which
by the title itself should be a turn off for men. <br /><br />But contrary to the repeated studio chick flick clich&#xE9;, this one
deserves to be called the sequel to 2008 blockbuster The Hangover,
rather than the rehashed turkey that is to be presented to the paying
audience next week.<br /><br />The wedding scenario that is done to death gets a fresh look and this
one does not hide behind the curtains of sugar coated humor. Co-written
by SNL veteran Kristen Wiig and produced by guy flicks veteran Judd
Apatow, Bridemaid produces some shock inducing laughter&#x27;s in sequences
that generally would require the viewing men to grow a vagina to go
through the entire wedding season. Kristen stops at nothing from a
hilarious food poisoning emergency during the wedding dress shopping to
virtual breakdown of one the bridesmaid during the pre-wedding all
ladies social gathering, the movie just turns the entire wedding
episode upside down.<br /><br />The ever miserable love life of Annie (Kristen Wiig) becomes to a
virtual breakdown of her life during the wedding of her &#x27;since
childhood&#x27; best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Her unprofessional work
ethic at jewelry store left aside; Annie is pretty much miserable in
everything. Jon Hamm is the latest of her boyfriends that she has been
dealing with; who uses her as &#x27;f**k-buddies&#x27; in his own words. She is
sharing an apartment with British siblings who are outrageous in their
own rights. Finally, for her the bottom point in her life would if she
moves in with her mother, no prizes for guessing that whether it
happens after all.<br /><br />Things really start to unravel when the wedding festivities begins with
Lillian aligning Annie with a blockbuster team of Bridesmaids for her
wedding. Special mention for Melissa McCarthy who steals the show
during the movie characters every comic turn. Ellie Kemper and Wendi
McLendon- Covey provide enough support to deserve their place in the
movie. But it is rivalry between ultra-suave &#x26; rich Helen (Rose Byrne)
and Annie to be the Maid of Honor that provides the background for
crazy wedding rides. The sequences of their rivalry are some of the
best cat fight you would witness without reaching to an actual physical
fight. The movie manages to pull off a genuine romantic angle to
Annie&#x27;s story with a budding romance with a highway patrol police
officer who more than obliges to pull over Annie for her various
driving offences.<br /><br />Bridesmaids provokes enough laughter from its audience to make them
forget about the Hangover they are or would receive while watching
Hangover part II; which is if not funny and original then is at least a
cautionary tale for the makers of Bridesmaids to tread the waters of
franchising the movie only after a few after thoughts about not slaying
the chicken that lay golden eggs. A final mention to Kristen Wiig and
her brand of comedy; it deserves to be mentioned among the likes Tina
Fey and Julie- Louis Dreyfus.
