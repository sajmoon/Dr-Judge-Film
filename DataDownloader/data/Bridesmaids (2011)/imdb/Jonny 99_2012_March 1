The most surprising thing about this supposedly female version of &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; (and &#x22;The Hangover II&#x22; which was apparently the same movie)
is how much it is not a female version of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. While to some
degree a raunchy comedy, the movie deals more with the complexities of
female relationship and dealing with personal failure in life more
similar to Alexander Payne&#x27;s &#x22;Sideways&#x22;. The movie take a long, well-
informed look at the waning process of longstanding female
relationships as well as female rivalry. The rivalry between Wiig&#x27;s
Annie Walker and a far more successful suitor for her best friend since
grade school Lilian (Maya Rudolph)is the better developed with very
funny scenes of one-ups- manship (or one-ups-womanship). Annie&#x27;s
coming-apart-at-the-seams development after she loses first a bakery
business, boyfriend and eventually her best friend is also interesting
to watch. You cannot blame Lilian&#x27;s or Chris O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s character turning
their back on her as her behavior gets more and more erratic. While the
strong plot carries the movie, there are some very distracting
problems. Wisconsin looks nothing like Southern California where a lot
of it was shot. State policemen act nothing like Officer Rhodes and
would quickly get fired if they did. Melissa MacCarthny&#x27;s Megan, which
got her an academy nom largely to make the group seem less stuffy,
makes no sense. Is she supposed to be the Zach Galifianakis screw-up
from &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; or the international spy we hear about towards the
end of the film. Wendy McLendon-Covey&#x27;s Rita is an interesting
character given that she foreshadows the miserable life that Maya&#x27;s
character (who seems a little old to be getting married for the first
time) is destined for later down the road. The film does have some
surprisingly darker moments before the obligatory ending dance number.
In short, more substance here than you have been lead to believe
although there are some genuinely funny moments.
