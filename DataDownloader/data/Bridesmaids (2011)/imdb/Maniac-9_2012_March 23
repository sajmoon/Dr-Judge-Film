The way that this movie was marketed and hyped up about I thought I was
going to see the female version of The Hangover, which it&#x27;s not even
close to being. There&#x27;s a few comedic points of the movie but for the
most part it&#x27;s a typical sappy love story. The movie wasn&#x27;t bad mind
you just not what I was hoping to get out of the movie going
experience. They call the movie Bridesmaids but it ought as well have
been titled The Bridesmaid since the whole movie is basically about
Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character Annie. The Helen character and the bride Lilly
get a bit of time too but the other 2 bridesmaids are basically after
thoughts. Like I said it wasn&#x27;t a bad movie but at the same time I
don&#x27;t think it deserved the Best Picture nomination.
