This movie is being advertised as &#x22;the Hangover for women&#x22; and not your
typical chick flick but I find that to be the most false advertising of
all-time. Not only is this thing a typical chick flick, it&#x27;s like chick
flick concentrate. I honestly can&#x27;t imagine many men laughing or
enjoying this film if they&#x27;re being totally honest. How this qualifies
being called a comedy almost beyond belief. It&#x27;s an average story about
a &#x22;relatable&#x22; woman with issues that grows and discovers herself and
true love over the course of a film. YAWN. Very little is funny in even
the remotest of ways. Maybe the ending could be considered heartwarming
but any praise this film generates has got to be from people
desperately wanting it to be good or wanting it to be funny because,
quite frankly, it&#x27;s neither.<br /><br />It is, however, a strong contender for most overrated movie of the
year. If you&#x27;re a guy, do yourself a favor and avoid this like the
plague even on DVD. Many of us will get persuaded to see it like I did
but don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.<br /><br />I&#x27;d say the critics don&#x27;t want to tell the truth about this film
because they either don&#x27;t want to anger the women in their lives or
their female patrons. Seriously.
