This movie is most definitely worth watching. The story is clich&#xE9;, yes,
yet the makes have created something out of it I could laugh at. It
caught my attention since the situations are so weird, but created with
an eye for details. <br /><br />I most absolutely loved the actresses,they managed to really be the
persons the should be. <br /><br />This is a movie I would be proud of if I&#x27;d created it. I think the
makes should definitely be proud, as this is one of the better movies
containing the bridal theme. I have seen wedding daze, wedding
crashers, bride wars and this movie and I must say this is definitely
one of the better ones.
