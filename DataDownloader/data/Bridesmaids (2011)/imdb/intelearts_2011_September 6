Bridesmaids is the funniest straight-up comedy that this viewer has
seen for a very, very long time. Sure, it&#x27;s rude &#x26; crude, with a
sentimental side, and it&#x27;s all delivered with such verve that it
triumphs.<br /><br />The plot is exactly what the title says - Bridesmaids, and every one of
them is portrayed well (We really liked Melissa McCarthy, know from the
Gilmore Girls and Mike &#x26; Molly, who gives it 100% - she is the OTT
character and rather than nauseate she brings her wonderful energy to
this and it works). Director Paul Feig, best known for TV comedies The
Office and Freaks and Geeks does a really nice job.<br /><br />There is scene after scene of laugh out loud lines, and we can&#x27;t
remember the last time a comedy made us laugh this much, instead of
just smile. <br /><br />Bridesmaids is definitely not just all focused on sex and
relationships, there&#x27;s a good measure of life in there too. The
situation comedy is nearly as sharp as the lines and generally work
well - it&#x27;s the wit in the script and the comic timing that really
makes this though.<br /><br />Honestly, if you coped with American Pie there is nothing worse here -
and for my money this there is an honesty about being female, single,
and over 30 that makes this more than just the laugh-fest it is.<br /><br />A funny and fun film with a great ensemble cast that you&#x27;d have to have
missed the last 20 years to find offensive - made us laugh....a lot.
