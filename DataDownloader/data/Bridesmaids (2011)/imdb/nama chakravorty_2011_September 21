&#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; is a One-Time Watch, that entertains here and there. An
engaging &#x26; hilarious first-hour, and a sterling central performance by
it&#x27;s lead star Kristen Wiig, are enough to give this recent box-office
hit a watch.<br /><br />&#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; Synopsis: Picked as her best friend&#x27;s maid of honor,
lovelorn and broke Annie looks to bluff her way through the expensive
and bizarre rituals with an oddball group of bridesmaids.<br /><br />A full-on Woman-Flick, &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; begins wonderfully &#x26; offers an
engaging &#x26; hilarious first-hour. The Screenplay by Annie Mumolo &#x26;
Kristen Wiig herself, is top-notch in the first-hour. But, in the
second-hour, it falters hugely. The Screenplay loses pace and the
clich&#xE9;d moments, disappoint. Though it does pick-up again in it&#x27;s
penultimate moments, the overall impact seems to be missing. How one
truly wishes if the writing material, could&#x27;ve been as good in the
second-hour, as it was in the first-hour.<br /><br />Paul Feig&#x27;s Direction is fair. Cinematography is good. Editing is
passable. Art Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: As mentioned,
Kristen Wiig delivers a sterling central performance. The Talented
Performer, stands on her own all through. A performance that deserves
to honored! Maya Rudolph is first-rate, as usual. Melissa McCarthy is
fantastic &#x26; brings in a host of good laughs. Rose Byrne is nice. Wendi
McLendon-Covey &#x26; Ellie Kemper support well. Chris O&#x27;Dowd is passable.
Jon Hamm stands out in a guest appearance. <br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; is decent one-time watch.
