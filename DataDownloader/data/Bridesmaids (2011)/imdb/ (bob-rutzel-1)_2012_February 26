Lillian (Maya Rudolph) picks Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her Maid of Honor,
but Helen (Rose Byrne) vies for the job anyway and things get way out
of control.<br /><br />This could have been a nice movie regarding friendships if the
inappropriate and disgusting parts were eliminated. And, there were
many. Let&#x27;s start with the inappropriate and almost x-rated sex act in
the opening scenes to the disgusting parts: a woman in a wedding gown
defecating in the street ; a woman defecating in a sink of all places;
a woman throwing up on the head of another woman also throwing up in a
toilet; and language, language, language throughout. Do women really
talk this way when by themselves? <br /><br />Billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here unless the
disgusting parts mentioned row your boat. Women wrote this screenplay
and when that happens, they seem to have a tendency to outdo the men to
come up with Super-Raunchy stuff and that they did. <br /><br />The only thing that would change these disgusting acts is that they be
shown as promos on network TV during prime time. Now, you know that
will never happen. The promos only show you the tame stuff and off you
go to what you think will be a nice movie regarding friendships and
then get the shock of your life. <br /><br />However, there is a nice boy meets girl scenario when Annie meets
Officer Nathan (Chris O&#x27;Dowd). These scenes are pleasant. And, later
when Annie needs Officer Nathan to help find Lillian and she does crazy
things in her car toward that end, Nathan won&#x27;t budge because he was
jilted earlier by Annie. These scenes are somewhat comical. Too bad the
rest of the movie wasn&#x27;t like this. <br /><br />Ready for more shocks? It seems that if your character behaves
outrageously in a raunchy manner you get a Best Supporting Actress
nomination. <br /><br />And, one more: there is also an Oscar nomination for Best Writing for
Original Screenplay. Give me a break. (1/10)<br /><br />Violence: No. Sex act: Yes. Nudity: No. Public Defecation: Yes.
Children spewing F-bombs: Yes. Language: F-bombs throughout.
