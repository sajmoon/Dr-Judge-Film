&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is a huge breath of fresh air after the atrocious,
forgettable messes of romantic comedies that were &#x22;Bride Wars&#x22; (2009)
and &#x22;You Again&#x22; (2010) to name a few. After sitting through those
movies, which despite their bad reviews were actually modest box office
hits, I truly assumed the wedding movie was dead. Wedding movies of
late were either overly- sentimental fluff that could be used as
wedding planners&#x27; promotional videos, or uninspired slapstick comedy
where attractive women pull mean pranks on one another.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is already being toted as an alternative wedding movie
because it&#x27;s co- produced by Judd Apatow, and has gross-out humor that
decidedly appeals to guys. There is toilet humor in only one section of
the movie, and it is funny, but it&#x27;s not solely what makes the film
great.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are two of the funniest and most talented
women to ever come out of &#x22;Saturday Night Live&#x22;. I always thought they
deserved the successful post-SNL careers that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
are currently experiencing, and this movie may ensure they get it.<br /><br />Wiig, as the star and the co-writer of this film, turns in a great,
poignant performance here as Annie, a woman who is down on her luck in
love and her career. She once owned a bake shop that closed due to the
recession, and she&#x27;s in a hapless, artificial relationship with a cad
played by Jon Hamm.<br /><br />Her best friend Lillian (Rudolph), on the other hand, is getting
married and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. The trouble is, Annie
is not quite as experienced in planning wedding festivities as another
bridesmaid, Helen (Rose Byrne), who is a more recent friend of Lillian.
Helen is quite a bit wealthier than Annie, and much more ostentatious
and bombastic about her position in life, although more subtly.<br /><br />It&#x27;s really funny how Wiig plays up how enraged Annie is over Helen,
and Helen is indeed a character who is easy to dislike. Many other
Hollywood writers would have staged a big fight between the two
bridesmaids involving throwing food and scratching. The problem with a
scene like that is it&#x27;s childish. You really wouldn&#x27;t see women in
their 30&#x27;s acting such a way, unless perhaps they&#x27;re on &#x22;Bridezilla&#x22;.<br /><br />More to the point though, the movie works because it really centers on
how preparation for a happy event like a wedding can be really
stressful on different involved parties for different reasons. Such
planning also rekindles hard feelings in some people over where they
are in life, and why they are not where they want to be. For that
reason, you really empathize with Wiig in her performance. Fortunately,
it also helps that her comic timing is spot on.<br /><br />There are also great supporting performances all around. Melissa
McCarthy (TV&#x27;s &#x22;Mike and Molly&#x22;) steals a lot of scenes with some
gut-bustingly hilarious lines, not to mention a gross- out moment
involving a bathroom sink. Chris O&#x27;Dowd also turns in a memorable
performance as Officer Nathan Rhodes, and has many genuinely sweet
moments alongside Wiig. The late Jill Clayburgh was the perfect casting
choice for Annie&#x27;s Mom, and has some great lines that keep the movie
down to earth. It&#x27;s hard to think of a better final performance on her
part.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; did occasionally fall victim to a few wedding movie
clich&#xE9;s, such as one of the bridal party members getting cold feet the
day of the wedding, and a big name musical act actually performing at
the end of the film. However, there is so much this movie did correctly
that many wedding comedies have done wrong, especially &#x22;Brides Wars&#x22;.<br /><br />I should note, however, that &#x22;Bride Wars&#x22; was also co-written by a
female former SNL-cast member, Casey Wilson, so it&#x27;s not entirely fair
to rip on that movie. Plus, Wilson is a very talented performer who
happened to be fired from SNL before she really got to shine.
Considering how well Wiig has done on and outside of SNL, it probably
wouldn&#x27;t hurt for her to give Wilson some writing tips.
