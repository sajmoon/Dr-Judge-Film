Let&#x27;s start this off by saying, I think Maya Rudolph is a fantastic
actress and have loved her forever. That said....this movie was so
criminally mismarketed that I can&#x27;t believe anybody walked out thinking
they got what they walked in to see. This film is a very touchy feely
personal journey piece, not the gut busting laugh out loud comedy that
was in the trailers. Had I gone in expecting a drama/comedy, then I
would have been OK, not thrilled, but OK with the movie. Throw in that
Melissa McCarthy was beyond awkward in most of her scenes... can&#x27;t
believe she is the same actress that is great in Mike and Molly.
Overall, just a very disappointing comedy that left me wishing I had
skipped it on the video shelf.
