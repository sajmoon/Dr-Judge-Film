First, this movie is a very shallow comedy. No comedy of this nature
should be over 2 hours. It means that the funny parts are far too
spread out to keep momentum, and shines too much light on the generic,
contrived story we&#x27;ve all seen before. There were a few funny scenes
and lines (all of them in the trailer), and the rest was BORING.
Watched with my wife this past weekend and we both were very
disappointed as we had been wanting to see this movie for months. I&#x27;m
certainly glad we didn&#x27;t spend $25 on it, and even free (on the video
player they provided on our United Airlines flight) it was still a
waste of time. There were other movies to choose from and we feel duped
into watching this one. We even stopped watching the lame Cars 2 to
watch this, and I kind of wish I had watched the end of that one
instead. Considering how bad Cars 2 was, that really says something.
I&#x27;d give this a 1, but I like most of the cast and they all had their
moments, but this movie answers the question: &#x22;what happens when you
stick some of the funniest comic actresses of the year into one movie?
You get a mess...&#x22;
