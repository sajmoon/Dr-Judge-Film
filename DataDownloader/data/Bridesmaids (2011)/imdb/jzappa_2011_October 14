I would say Kristen Wiig fixes a bawdy, plucky and boldly
estrogen-soaked banner in the male-dominated raunch-comedy genre with
this comedy from the Judd Apatow workshop that his fans have long been
hoping for, were it not for that the dilemma at the center of the film
is an earnest jealousy over who gets to plan a girlfriend&#x27;s wedding and
lose all self-control when you&#x27;re not chosen to do so. It&#x27;s not
empowering in the way 9 to 5 or A League of Their Own are, but more
like a smarter, funnier, ultimately not a whole lot less petty Sex and
the City.<br /><br />Wiig plays a has-been cupcake entrepreneur whose bakery went bust in
the downturn and whose love life comprises ad hoc sex with her
obnoxiously vain bed pal, in a hilarious turn by Jon Hamm. Indeed,
Bridesmaids opens with one of Wiig and Hamm&#x27;s vigorous sessions in bed,
an unmistakable broadcast that this is a movie that doesn&#x27;t want much
to do with restraint like most chick flicks. When Wiig finds that her
lifetime best friend Maya Rudolph is engaged, and that Wiig herself is
to be maid of honor, the new reality propels her into a cave-in of
resentment, unhappiness and self-pity. But when it&#x27;s revealed that
Rudolph&#x27;s bridal party will also involve the moneyed, statuesque,
impossibly proper Rose Byrne, Wiig&#x27;s anxieties filter into extravagant
circumstances of uncontrollable impulses. This New Money snob is
plainly a challenger for Wiig&#x27;s BFF position, a rallying call Wiig
confronts with a swelling succession of ill-advised efforts at
one-upswomanship, each bombardment including at least a couple of cup
sizes full of explosive laughs.<br /><br />As funny as these moments are, it&#x27;s the smaller, more perceptive ones
in this Apatow production that I hoped would make it worth
appreciating, for director of Bridesmaids is Paul Feig, creator of
Apatow&#x27;s early call to arms for all his talented regulars, Freaks and
Geeks, also both touching and hilarious. And indeed, an early scene
here with Wiig and Rudolph, in which a chat effortlessly rolls from
blowjobs to finely conveyed inside jokes, seizes the patterns and
mutual implicit back story of friendship without a glitch. When Wiig
meets a romantic-interest policeman named Rhodes, played expressively
by Irish actor Chris O&#x27;Dowd, the sense is likewise discreet and
credible. But this diverting but unfocused formula comedy, which gets
this handful of qualities so spot-on, doesn&#x27;t appear to grasp that it&#x27;s
wide of the mark for much of the remainder: It&#x27;s content to indulge in
graphic and humiliating inconsequentialities, and bashful about the
material about which it should&#x27;ve been graphic and indulgent.<br /><br />Wiig has the unaffected beauty and self-deprecating showmanship it
takes to be a star comedienne. She so deftly manages both the laughs
and the more tender frowny-faced side of Bridesmaids that the movie&#x27;s
supporting characters often don&#x27;t have the opportunity to come into
their own. Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s talented consort Rudolph is too often
demoted to judgmental on-looker of Wiig&#x27;s behavior.<br /><br />As two of Wiig&#x27;s fellow dyed-to-complement entourage, Wendi
McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper have virtually nothing to do, except
one scene culminating in amusingly maudlin drunkenness. In fact, the
one eponymous character who imperils to give Wiig a movie-stealing
hustle for the envelope is the groom&#x27;s husky sister Megan, played by an
unvaryingly laugh-out-loud Melissa McCarthy.<br /><br />It&#x27;s an excessively manufactured hodgepodge, attempting too many comic
ideas that ultimately drown the core theme of what a modern woman needs
from friendship, love and marriage. If the movie was meant to be
bolder, it definitely had a apt satirical foil at its center. The issue
of overindulgence, which inculcate the series of extravagant parties in
the long build-up to the overstated wedding that ends the movie is left
virtually ignored. Never does Bridesmaids ever try for real biting
stuff. So at the same time as it feels unreasonable to carp that
Bridesmaids never comes together as a cutting satire of the demeaning
protocol of getting married that it portrays, the existence of other
comedies in Apatow&#x27;s canon, perhaps especially Feig&#x27;s work, which
develop their character arcs into something more complete and poignant,
prevails as an gauge of Bridesmaids&#x27; lack.
