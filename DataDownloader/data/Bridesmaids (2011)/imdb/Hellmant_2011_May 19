&#x27;BRIDESMAIDS&#x27;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />Judd Apatow tries his style of raunchy yet emotional comedy/drama with
a chick flick by producing this Kristen Wiig vehicle (an &#x27;SNL&#x27; and
supporting film player vet). Wiig stars in the film as well as co-wrote
it with comedian Annie Mumolo. Apatow&#x27;s buddy Paul Feig (who created
the popular short run TV series &#x27;FREAKS AND GEEKS&#x27;, which Apatow also
produced) directed the film. It co-stars Maya Rudolph (a fellow &#x27;SNL&#x27;
vet), Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Wendi McLendon-Covey
and Chris O&#x27;Dowd. The film tells the story of a woman going through a
midlife crisis at the same time that her best friend is getting
married. Most of the film&#x27;s big laughs come from the type of vulgar and
crude humor you usually only see in guy movies, which is a nice change
of pace and ballsy. The film isn&#x27;t quite as consistently hilarious as
Apatow&#x27;s best films but for the most part it works and it does have the
touching emotional aspect that Apatow films are known for as well
(which it actually does a better job of delivering).<br /><br />Wiig plays Annie, a down on her luck jewelery store clerk who had
recently attempted to follow her dreams and open a bakery. Despite
Annie&#x27;s great cooking talents the bakery failed due to the recession
(she says). She&#x27;s also had a lot of poor luck with men and is
constantly treated like merely a f--- buddy by the pretty boy she
wishes was her boyfriend (Jon Hamm). When her best friend Lillian
(Rudolph) tells her she&#x27;s getting married and asks her to be her maid
of honor she falls deeper into depression and despair. Things are
complicated further when a rivalry grows for Lillian&#x27;s affection
between Annie and Lillian&#x27;s new good friend Helen (Byrne, looking more
stunning than ever), who&#x27;s also the rich beautiful wife of Lillian&#x27;s
fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s boss.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of hilarious moments, including some of the
raunchiest and most vulgar dick and fart jokes of any comedy recently,
but at times the jokes tend to stretch on too much and lose a lot of
their momentum. The movie is way too long for a slapstick romantic
comedy (at a whopping 2 hours and 5 minutes!) and some of the vulgar
jokes are almost too grotesque to even sit through (at least for me, I
had an extremely hard time stomaching this movie). When it is funny it
works though and Wiig is very impressive in the lead. The rest of the
cast is more than adequate as well (especially Byrne, McCarthy and
O&#x27;Dowd). The emotional drama of the film is surprisingly what works
best about it, it really feels true and heartfelt (especially the
relationship between Annie and a friendly police officer (O&#x27;Dowd).
While the movie isn&#x27;t quite as good as Apatow&#x27;s best it&#x27;s still an
impressive achievement and hopefully will help pave the way for more
female driven crude comedies to set new ground in the future.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
