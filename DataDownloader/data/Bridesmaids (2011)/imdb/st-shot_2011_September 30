Why should guys have all the ungoverned gross out laughs in films seems
to be the intent of Bridesmaids a very funny response to the men
behaving silly Hangover franchise. What amounts to a girls road trip
picture is filled with some gut busting moments. <br /><br />Annie&#x27;s (Kristin Wiig ) lifetime buddy Lillian (Maya Rudolph) asks her
to be her maid of honor. Cash strapped Annie just coming off the
failure of her cake business is honored but also perplexed on how to
keep the cost down but remains determined to give her friend the best
she can afford. A well heeled other maid (Rose Byrne) however attempts
to assume Annie&#x27;s duties with the two tight rope walking a precarious
civility and developing a fierce competition. Out gunned Annie&#x27;s
attempts to keep things under control with disastrous but hilarious
results.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is filled with comic moments of shockingly funny scenes
with the diffuse group of maids and bride to be all pitching into the
laugh pool. Wiig does a fine job of embarrassing herself in scene after
scene while Rose Byrne as her poised nemesis does an equally fine job
of stoking her insecurity and fostering havoc. In the role of the
requisite funny fat guy ala Zach Galifinakis, Jack Black etc. Mellissa
Mc Carthey fits the role perfectly with the same self assured dead pan
flare.<br /><br />While the cast and the situations do hold there own in the zany
department with guy versions Bridesmaids begins to drag with time outs
for melancholy reflection and heart to hearts stretching the film
beyond two hours resulting in diluting the full comic thrust and while
it prevents Bridesmaids from becoming the bride of all comedies there
are more than enough belly laughs for a good time to be had by all.
