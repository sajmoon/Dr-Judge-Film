So I was pretty interested in seeing this movie, in the past I&#x27;ve been
a big Judd Apatow fan and I like the idea of a female-centered comedy.
I was excited when I saw the great reviews, which made it watching the
movie especially disappointing.<br /><br />The movie was a pretty painful experience. It is filled with
uncomfortable/awkward moments from jokes being dragged on too long, for
example the toast at the engagement party (which I fast forwarded
through when I couldn&#x27;t take it any more)as well as fart/vomit jokes
which I can&#x27;t believe continues to appear in so many movies. Overall,
the movie seems to paint a negative picture of women. I was surprised
that this was written by a woman, it basically portrays women as sad,
unable to function with out a man, catty and superficial. Anyway, can&#x27;t
speak for the whole movie given that I turned it off half way through,
but I felt the need to write to save others the time.
