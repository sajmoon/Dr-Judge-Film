In Milwaukee, the bitter Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a complete
loser with a messy life: she is the sex toy of the womanizer Ted; she
has a lousy job of seller in jewelry; she drives a junk car; she shares
her apartment with two morons and siblings; she bankrupted her bakery
business. When her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) invites her to be
the maid of honor with four bridesmaids, Annie feels jealous and
envious of the gorgeous and wealthy Helen Harris (Rose Byrne) and they
compete to be Lillian&#x27;s best friend. Meanwhile the police officer
Nathan Rhodes (Chris O&#x27;Dowd) feels attracted to Annie.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaid&#x22; is an overrated comedy with a terrible story, scatological
jokes and an envious lead character that takes the most despicable
attitudes in the party of her best friend due to her envy. I really did
not like this awful story but I laughed with some bizarre situations.
The joke with the Brazilian food is ridiculous. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Miss&#xE3;o Madrinha de Casamento&#x22; (&#x22;Mission Maid of
Honor&#x22;)
