There is something I don&#x27;t quite understand. If Maya Rudolph is the
bride, and she is a woman of color, why aren&#x27;t there any other women of
color as her bridesmaids? This seems to be such a deliberate oversight
on the part of the Hollywood producers ad a negative view of the
actress about her own race. I haven&#x27;t seen the movie, but if she is
passing for white then she has allowed Hollywood to use her as a pawn
for benign racism. It is beyond belief that any African American even
partly has never had any dealings with their own people unless they are
in denial and totally identify with being white. Even if it is true,
why capitalize on it. It shows great disrespect and embarrassment
towards her mother, Minnie Ripperton, one of the greatest singers of
all time. If I am wrong in this issue I stand corrected and apologize
profusely. This reminds me the racist eras of when Elizabeth Taylor
portrayed the role of Cleopatra instead of the likes of a Dorothy
Dandridge or Eartha Kitt. Shame on you, Hollywood once again!!
