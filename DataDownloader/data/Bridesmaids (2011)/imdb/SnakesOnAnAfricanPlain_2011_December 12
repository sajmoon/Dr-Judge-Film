No points for plot or story. You can pretty much tell exactly where
every relationship and character arc is headed, and at over 2 hours it
becomes a bit unnecessary. Luckily the film is just fantastically
funny. It really does know how to play out all kinds of humour. From
those embarrassing moments, to gross-out set pieces, and a variety of
oddball characters. Wiig plays Annie, who has just been asked to be the
maid of honour at her best friend&#x27;s wedding. Cue a series of comical
mishaps and a rivalry with Rose Byrne. Chris O&#x27;Dowd really stood out to
me, undoing most of the harm from Gulliver&#x27;s Travels. His relationship
with Wiig seemed believable and was a good anchor point for the rest of
the shenanigans. There were times when this very comical cast tried to
outdo each other in the now common improv scenes. This was sometimes
too distracting as it would just go on and on. Melissa McCarthy should
also be applauded for taking on a role with no shame. Great cast, great
jokes, just a bit overstretched in places.
