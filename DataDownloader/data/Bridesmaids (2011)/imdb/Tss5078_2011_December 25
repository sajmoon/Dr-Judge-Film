Ever since this movie came out, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it,
still, I was hesitant to see it. I mean bridesmaids, a wedding, I just
wasn&#x27;t sure. It was however produced by Judd Apatow, and that alone
made me give it a chance. Basically, Bridesmaids is a girls version of
The Hangover meets Knocked Up, with an almost trip to Vegas and without
the hangover. Kristen Wiig is the writer and star of this film and she
was great! I&#x27;d never even heard of her before this film came out, but
after seeing it, I want a lot more. It seems pretty hard for a woman to
make it in comedy, it&#x27;s a fairly rare event, but she&#x27;s got a tremendous
future ahead of her. As for the story it&#x27;s pretty solid, it&#x27;s a comedy,
so you&#x27;re not really looking for realism, just something cohesive that
you can follow and this definitely fits the bill. If you&#x27;re looking for
something funny, but different, I&#x27;d highly recommend this film.
