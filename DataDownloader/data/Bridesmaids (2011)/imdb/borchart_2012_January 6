I do not understand all the positive reviews here. How can such an
awful movie get 7.0 average rating on IMDb? The movie is advertised as
a comedy, but there is hardly any funny scene in it. Most of the time,
the sad and boring life of the main protagonist (a lady) is shown,
where big parts are not related to the other brides. This is more
depressing than funny to watch. <br /><br />I believed that this might be some ladies version of the popular film
hangover, but you cannot compare it at all. Where hangover dealt with
the wedding-eve party only and the funny things that happened, this
movie starts weeks before the marriage and deals with all sorts of
other topics (that were mostly not funny BTW). There is not really a
red line in this film thats what i missed.<br /><br />Overall, after the movie i had the impression to have wasted 2 precious
hours of my life for a not entertaining movie. I hope i can warn some
people from doing the same.
