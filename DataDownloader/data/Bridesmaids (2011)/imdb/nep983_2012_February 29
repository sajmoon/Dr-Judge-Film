I have to say I loved this movie and thought it was pretty funny and
definitely deserved those two Oscar nominations. And I have to say
Melissa McCarthy is just hilarious.<br /><br />Basically the movie is about someones best friend getting married and
all that stuff but still it&#x27;s worth checking out. The cast is also
pretty funny too <br /><br />Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo deliver a funny script as well. I also
think this movie isn&#x27;t overrated either. 7/10 See it! or go rent it at
least. What this movie doesn&#x27;t need is a sequel that will ruin
everything.
