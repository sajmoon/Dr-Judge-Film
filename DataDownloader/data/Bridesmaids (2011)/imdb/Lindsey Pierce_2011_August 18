I really enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud in the theater. A lot.
It was like the female version of The Hangover in a lot of ways.
However, this movie isn&#x27;t really about bridesmaids; rather it&#x27;s about a
woman (Kristin Wig&#x27;s character) waking up to her current lifestyle,
hitting rock bottom, and finally taking responsibility for herself.
Where the Hangover stuck to the main plot throughout the entire film,
Bridesmaids flips back &#x26; forth between Annie&#x27;s personal/love life and
her role in her best friend&#x27;s wedding. It was a good mix of emotion and
comedy so I never got bored and was always surprised. I would have
liked to see some funny outtakes during the final credits like most
comedies do.
