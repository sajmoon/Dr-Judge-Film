2011_November 13 
To sum it up - this film is crass, unfunny, foul-mouthed (and I thought
I was broad-minded!), poorly written drivel that masquerades as a
comedy. There are a lot of American comedies that I find less than
amusing nowadays and which seem to be focused on teenage boys and their
bodily functions, but this female version really scrapes the bottom of
the barrel. (Thank God for the Coen brothers! And for writers who
understand that good comedy uses humour, subtlety, satire and wit
rather than a sledgehammer to get a point across!) This film sets out
to shock and that is, in fact, the only area in which it succeeds.<br /><br />The women in it are (mostly) so awful that if you were a guy you&#x27;d
choose to be gay, and as a woman you would choose to elope! A minute
with this group of women is 60 seconds too long.
