I had not expected this movie to be one of the worst I saw this year.
After all, it has a decent rating on IMDb, it&#x27;s produced by Judd
Apatow, and it was lauded as the &#x22;female hangover&#x22;. What could go wrong
here? As it turns out, pretty much everything. This movie managed to
literally hit all, and I really mean all, the wrong buttons for me.<br /><br />I guess that at least something could be said for the premise, which
basically is combining a fart comedy with a romantic drama. Somehow,
though, it manages to take the very worst aspects of a drama and the
very worst part of a fart comedy.<br /><br />First of all, save for one or two instances, the humor totally misses
the mark. I think I smiled maybe twice during the entire two hour
running time, which must be a new low on the jokes per minute scale.
The jokes just don&#x27;t work..the physical humor is just plain vulgar in a
bad way, and the verbal humor, while probably supposed to be sharp,
just comes across as pointless angry ranting. Also, just about every
scene goes on for way too long, ruining any potential there might have
been.<br /><br />For a drama, it also fails badly. First of all, just about every
character with the possible exception of the police officer love
interest, is self-obsessed, unsympathetic, shallow and just plain
boring. It&#x27;s impossible to care about these characters as they go
through the horribly overlong (the movie is slow to a fault, as well)
motions and end up at the horribly predictable conclusion.<br /><br />I suppose some will pass of this movie as &#x22;clever&#x22; or &#x22;original&#x22; but in
the end it&#x27;s just the same old romcom template which has been done
hundreds of time before..only this time with no humor, no chemistry and
a lot of poorly executed &#x22;serious&#x22; take on the subject.
