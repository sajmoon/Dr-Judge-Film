BRIDESMAIDS is not a film this viewer would normally have watched, but
in a week where there is very little else available On Demand on
television, the button parked here. In many ways the film was a
surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was
that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to
demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men.
But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy
in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with
other women. Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed
by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in
distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR
(barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women
in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.<br /><br />Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream
of having her own bakery and having a meaningless physical relationship
with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya
Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting
married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is
broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer,
she accepts the responsibilities. The sparkle of the wedding dream
plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will
be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese
socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate
mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca
(Ellie Kemper). In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian
caf&#xE9;, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of
Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as
potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.<br /><br />There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of
attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes a sparkling Chris
O&#x27;Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie&#x27;s
ridiculous life and Annie&#x27;s mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was
to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was
completed). Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her
expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods
along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER,
this is a sad little film about bruised women and how their
interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead. <br /><br />Grady Harp
