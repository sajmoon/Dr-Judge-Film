The title &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; was a little misleading at first, me and
probably everyone else who only heard the title was instantly thinking
&#x27;chick flick&#x27;. I&#x27;d like to make it clear right now, just because a
movie has a female cast, that doesn&#x27;t automatically make it a chick
flick (not bashing that sub genre, just clarifying). It was a bit on
the rom-com side, but most comedies are. Anyway, once the trailer
started and i saw that the brilliance of Apatow and Feig were
collaborating, i had to see it. From beginning to end i couldn&#x27;t stop
laughing, the cast was perfect, especially Kristen Wiig. It&#x27;s as if the
jokes were tailored to her comedic style, which is probably due to her
involvement in the writing process. What was really great about this
movie, which is a large part of any comedy movie being successful,
Bridesmaids is infinitely quotable!! (supposed to be all caps, but IMDb
told me i couldn&#x27;t shout hahah but i love shouting!!!!). Seriously, i
saw it a few days ago at an advanced screening, and haven&#x27;t been able
to stop talking about it. Instant classic, cant wait to see it again.
