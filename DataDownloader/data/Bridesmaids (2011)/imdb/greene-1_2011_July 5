As a British guy I am glad to report that this &#x27;chick-flick&#x27; made me
laugh out loud several times in the normally reserved arena that is the
London film circuit. Understated performances by the ensemble cast
really bring out the humour and largely avoid the in-your-face obvious
gags which can be a let down to a sophisticated audience. Not that this
film is without elements of quite medieval grossness, but these are
played straight which actually adds to the comedic element and
furthermore they do not dominate the film. Wisely they have avoided
stereotyping the characters and you actually come to care for them
warts and all, this has the added bonus of sustaining interest during
the &#x27;serious&#x27; moments also. Bridesmaids has a multi layered comedic
approach which will appeal on many levels. There are a few weak scenes
but these are more than compensated for by the overall work. In
conclusion this film manages to wrap up a meditation on the nature of
friendship and love whilst ladling out the laughs, go see!
