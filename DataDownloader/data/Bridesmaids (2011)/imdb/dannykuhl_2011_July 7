I love Kristen Wiig. She&#x27;s one of my favorite performers on SNL and has
been very funny in previous movies. Therefore, I was very excited to
see this movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I literally
hated this movie. Not only was it not funny, but the scenes were
uncomfortably awkward and hard to watch. I&#x27;ve never left the theater in
the middle of a movie, but this was the closest I came. I only stayed
because the movie had such great reviews, and that made me think it was
going to get better. Instead, it got worse as it went along, and the
ending was terrible. The movie did make me chuckle a couple of times,
but the awkward and boring parts far outweighed any laughter or
enjoyment. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could enjoy this movie.
