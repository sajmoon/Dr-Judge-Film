Literally the best, most hysterical chick flick ever! I laughed so hard
that I cried, multiple times. Every woman needs to see this movie. Even
some guys were in the theater laughing too, so don&#x27;t think of
Bridesmaids as a strictly chick flick movie. The laughs are non stop,
with good humor and a great plot. You fall for the characters and you
will want to see this movie again. Even the trailer doesn&#x27;t do the
movie justice, because the movie is a lot funnier than the trailer.
Worth ever penny to see it theaters, and I will most definitely buy
this movie when it comes out on DVD. As of right now, this is the best
movie of the year!
