I thought this was supposed to be the female version of Hangover. Like
Hangover it made a ton of money at the box office. And like Hangover
there will probably be a sequel or two. But the similarity ends there.
Whig &#x26; Rudolf are from SNL and this feels like one very very long SNL
skit. Ms. Whig is on her way to becoming the next Adam Sandler. I can&#x27;t
believe this movie received Academy Award nominations and a movie like
Drive didn&#x27;t (well maybe one for sound). Melissa McCarthy is very
strange and because she is so different from most of the comedy actors
working today she is very watchable. You never know what she might do
next. I get the impression she will do anything for a laugh. A good
example is the sink scene in the upscale wedding shop. When she hosted
SNL she also took a lot of chances. I hope she starts to get better
material in the future.
