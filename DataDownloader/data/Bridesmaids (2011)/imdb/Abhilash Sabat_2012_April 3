I wasn&#x27;t really interested in watching this flick, but the positive
reviews did interest me. And i had a nice time watching it. Enjoyed it
mostly. Its more like a &#x22;female version of The Hangover&#x22; and in fact is
better than The Hangover. The &#x22;all female cast&#x22; are pretty good. They
DO make you laugh during all the funny sequences. The gags are pretty
much fresh as well. Its a Judd Apatow productions flick, therefore no
surprise that this was an actually good comedy to look out for. Also be
sure to watch out the UNRATED version of the movie, just about 6
minutes longer but adds few more laughs to the original version. Funny,
girly and entertaining..ain&#x27;t that a unique combination! By the way, no
idea why the hell Melissa McCarthy was nominated for an Oscar!!! Fine,
she had one or two funny moments.. but an Oscar nomination? She hardly
had about 15-20 minutes in the movie! Do watch it for its uniqueness
and freshness.<br /><br />My Rating - 6.5/10
