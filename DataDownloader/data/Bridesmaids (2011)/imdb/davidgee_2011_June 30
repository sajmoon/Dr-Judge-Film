Funny and very very rude, this is one of those movies you almost feel
guilty about liking. MURIEL&#x27;S WEDDING crossed with SEX ANMD THE CITY 2
and quite a lot of American PIE.<br /><br />Food poisoning in a bridal shop; Sex and City 2 and American Pie 1 had
hilarious incontinence scenes, but BRIDESMAIDS blows (not the best
verb) both of them out of the bathroom. Annie and Helen&#x27;s &#x27;showdown&#x27; at
the bridal shower was a well-scripted high spot, creating the momentum
for the turnaround moment and an irony-rich happy-ever-after ending.<br /><br />The characters really are not hugely different from Carrie Bradshaw and
Co but well-rounded with everyone given good lines and comic moments.
All the performances are outstanding except for Matt Lucas&#x27;s cameo as
Annie&#x27;s house-mate; he&#x27;s NOT given any good lines. And if the movie
does appear to pillage every bridal-themed movie ever made, it recycles
the material in a way that makes it seem original even when it plainly
is not. Sometimes crude and even gross, BRIDESMAIDS had me laughing out
loud from start to finish.
