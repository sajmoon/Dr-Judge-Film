I was under the impression that &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; would be another ditzy
rom-com, perhaps something on the lines of the ghastly &#x27;Bridewars&#x27;. I
had been avoiding it for some time until word of mouth got to me and I
learned of its international ensemble that included many gifted comedy
actors. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and refreshing surprise.
It has the polished look of those typical New York rom-coms and even
the romance and dramatic moments of that genre but what sets it apart
is the dialogue and the crudeness which really gives it more of a touch
of reality and it is done so amusingly. The humour is very dirty but
the jokes work excellently. It&#x27;s nice to see a comedy for a change with
interesting and funny female characters swearing and cussing and make
fools of themselves. All the actors perform confidently. Kristin Wiig
(whose also the co-writer alongside Annie Mumolo) does an excellent job
in carrying the film. She is wonderfully supported by the first rate
Rose Byrne, competent Maya Rudolph, scene stealer Melissa McCarthy,
laidback Chris O&#x27;Dowd, always dependable Jill Claybourgh (in her final
role) and many more. The writers and actors ensure that there&#x27;s plenty
to laugh at and I found myself laughing out loud many times. I see that
many have compared it to &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; but in my opinion,
&#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; is both funnier and cleverer.
