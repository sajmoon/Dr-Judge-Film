This movie isn&#x27;t quite as overrated as Paul was, despite the fact that
it got even better reviews. This movie has three things that saved it.
1. The way it made me actually care about Kristen Wigg&#x27;s friendship
with the bride. 2. The bridal shower scene. And 3. the most important
one, the fat chick, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy. Good Lord was
that chick hilarious. The scene where she just went screw it and began
crapping in a sink almost had me in tears. Every time she was on
screen, I had a smile on my face. I wish the same could be said for the
rest of the film. This movie has very unfunny scenes, the stuff on the
plane wasn&#x27;t funny, the scene where Kristen Wigg and Rose Byrne are
trying to get attention from the cop wasn&#x27;t that funny (exept when the
car rolled by and no one was seen in the car), and that scene where
Kristen and Rose are trying to give the better speech, Oh my God, shut
UP!!! That&#x27;s another problem, this movie is way, way too long, this
movie is about 2 hours and 5 minutes long, that&#x27;s already pretty long
for a comedy, but for me, it felt like five hours. Seriously, if a
movie is 2 hours long and it fells like 5, something has gone horribly
wrong.<br /><br />5/10
