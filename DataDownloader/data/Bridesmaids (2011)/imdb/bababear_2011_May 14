This is a perfect example of a script that needed a couple more
rewrites before they started to roll the cameras. There are several
hilarious short sketches here: Annie&#x27;s bizarre interaction with
customers in the jewelry store where she briefly works, a group of
young women becoming ill with food poisoning in an awesomely
pretentious bridal boutique where they try on overpriced and awesomely
hideous dresses, and a falling out between friends that disrupts a
vulgarly overdone bridal shower. Plus, this should push the issue of
making Casting a category at the Oscars: the young women are all
delightful in their own ways, and casting Jill Clayburgh as Annie&#x27;s
mother is an act of genius.<br /><br />The director should have watched some of the Marx Brothers movies, or
those directed by Howard Hawks. They took off like racehorses and
trusted the audience&#x27;s intelligence to keep up. This needs at least
thirty minutes cut out.<br /><br />There seems to have been directed to be watched on TV. There are
numerous spots where viewers could fold laundry, get a snack, go to the
bathroom, whatever, and it&#x27;s easy to see where the dead spots are
coming. It&#x27;s as if the director ran out of breath. And when you know
when a pop song comes on the soundtrack the action is going to screech
to a halt.<br /><br />Also, this is proof of how unnecessary profanity is in films. At first
there&#x27;s the mild amusement, but too soon the ladies are turning the air
blue: this has the unfortunate effect of making them sound as if they
are women pushing forty who are still in the sixth grade.<br /><br />Still, I&#x27;d recommend BRIDESMAIDS to anyone because the parts that do
work are greatness. And the wedding dress the bride wears to the
tastelessly overdone wedding- which she mentions to Annie in passing
her father can&#x27;t afford- is a hilarious sight gag, looking like canned
whip cream which has been sprayed on the unfortunate bride and somehow
turned to fabric. Bridesmaids&#x27; dresses are supposed to be hideous- it&#x27;s
traditional- but her outfit is something no woman would wear to a dog
fight.
