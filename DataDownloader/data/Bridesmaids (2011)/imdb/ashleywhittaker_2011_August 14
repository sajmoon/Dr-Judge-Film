Bridesmaids implores you to, &#x27;Save the date&#x27;, as the all-female cast
glare menacingly in their pink meringue frocks from the poster. For all
its gown fittings, cake tastings and bachelorette frolicking,
Bridesmaids really brings it with the toilet humour. This is definitely
not one to take your mother or a first date to. You&#x27;ll know what I mean
once you experience the pillow bitingly graphic sex scene that opens
the film. I should warn the fainter of heart that this seemingly lady
friendly, wedding-themed, rom-com comes from the creative loins of one
Judd Apatow; the man responsible for gross-out genre hits including, 40
Year Old Virgin and Superbad. <br /><br />Perhaps not so well known this side of the pond is the film&#x27;s writer,
Kristen Wiig, who has successfully helmed the team at Saturday Night
Live alongside the likes of Tina Fey since 2005. Honing her craft as
part of the infamous Los Angeles comedy sketch group, the Groundlings,
Wiig is comfortable among a cast of like-minded women who you will just
about recognise from bit parts in various indie flicks and alternative
US comedy series. A notable scene stealer comes in the form of Melissa
McCarthy; a regular on US cable, she does a 180 degree turn from her
usual style to portray Megan, the groom&#x27;s masculine yet predatorily
hetero sister. McCarthy is hardly a rose between thorns though amongst
this cast of truly glittering comedic performances.<br /><br />In fairness, I could describe Bridesmaids as the all-girl version of
recent hit, The Hangover, but in truth, it&#x27;s so much more than that.
Sure, it follows the fool proof plot of, best friends forever-one gets
engaged-they both set out to plan the best wedding ever-jealousy sets
in-a rift arises-then all is forgotten with a heart wrenching reunion,
but what else do you want from a light-hearted rom-com? Having seen
both, I can attest that the script is infinitely more natural and less
cheesy than the Hangover and I give full credit to the aforementioned
Wiig. Admittedly, the in your face toilet humour does seem more jarring
when delivered by females, but that says more about the Neanderthal
mentality of us viewers. You will be shocked to see the bride, Maya
Rudolph, defecating in an unthinkable location and even women&#x27;s&#x27; the
irresponsible drunkenness seems somehow more upsetting, but Bridesmaids
is a trail blazer in this sense. It&#x27;s nothing we haven&#x27;t seen before in
cinema, it&#x27;s just being said from behind a particularly beautiful
bridal gown.<br /><br />For those of you expecting a reprisal of that hallowed, long
anticipated girls&#x27; night out to the cinema of 2008 (and, undoubtedly,
again just last summer for the sequel) be aware that Bridesmaids is the
anti Sex in the City. In my opinion, and I loved SATC 1 and 2, this is
a good thing. Bridesmaids doesn&#x27;t skimp on drama or laughs, yet manages
to create authentic relationships between relatable women. It&#x27;s
surprising to find a film that subtly imparts touching life lessons
alongside diarrhoea and vomit explosions but Bridesmaids delivers just
that. Tell your boyfriend from me that I promise he won&#x27;t be bored and
please, for the love of god, don&#x27;t eat before you watch it.
