Went to see this movie on opening night with my wife. My wife laughs at
almost anything remotely funny and I didn&#x27;t hear much out of her for
the first 20-30min. I found the best aspect of the movie was the
relationship between Kristen Wiigs character and the policeman. I found
the parts with the bridesmaids to be be over the top, ridiculous, and
annoying. They tried too hard to be funny. I did like Kristen Wiig&#x27;s
character and wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing her in a romantic comedy. Chris
Odowd&#x27;s character was charming. endearing and was the most real. I was
really rooting for him to end up with the girl. In all, the movie has
some funny parts (mostly what you see in the trailer) but it would
probably have been better to have rented it.
