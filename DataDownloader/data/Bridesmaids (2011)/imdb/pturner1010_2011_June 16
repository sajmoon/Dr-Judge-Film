Synopsis: Down-on-her-luck Annie becomes maid of honour for her best
friend Lillian&#x27;s wedding. Fighting and bonding with the other
bridesmaids, Annie attempts to deliver the best wedding she can.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig is officially a comedy Goddess. The co-writer and star of
Bridesmaids takes centre stage after years on American television&#x27;s
Saturday Night Live and being sidelined with smaller roles in recent
comedies like Paul and Date Night. Here she is barely off screen and is
a hysterical joy to watch throughout. Funnier than the entire cast of
The Hangover (either of them), she would be enough to single-handedly
split your sides, but with an ensemble this brave and funny and writing
this hilarious, Bridesmaids is a laugh-out-loud comedy that deserves to
rule this summer. The sisters are doing it for themselves!<br /><br />Bridesmaids is very rude, occasionally very sweet and often
ass-clenchingly awkward. If you think gross-out comedy belongs to boys,
wait till you see these girls at their dress fitting. If you think men
being mean to women is funny, wait till you see it as written by a
couple of women. If you think the writer/producers of films like The
Hangover push the boundaries of taste, wait till you see these girls
get angry. But most of all if for some reason you think women, can&#x27;t be
funny, give yourself a slap and go see this film!<br /><br />The story might follow a fairly conventional path with the
romantic-comedy trimmings resulting in an ending that lacks much
surprise. However the narrative is tightly constructed and Annie really
&#x27;hits bottom&#x27; (allowing for countless awkward and self-deprecating
moments) before the film delivers its predictable resolution. The
script is brilliantly written with a touching and believable
relationship between the two best friends, Annie and Lillian. The comic
set-pieces escalate in a consistently hysterical fashion, standouts
being the dress fitting and a plane journey that allows Wiig to show
off what a gifted comedy performer she is. The script crackles with
witty and memorable dialogue, much of it delivered by Wiig, but the
supporting cast all get their own moments to shine as realistic and
funny characters.<br /><br />The best reason to see this film is Wiig. There is nothing she won&#x27;t do
in this film for a laugh. Whether it&#x27;s flailing her legs in the air in
the opening sex scene, toilet humour, acting drunk, selfishly ruining
parties, or swearing at a young woman, all vanity is left behind.
Wiig&#x27;s performance is consistently hilarious. As writer she has rightly
put herself up-front, giving her a vehicle to finally show off her
comedic prowess. The supporting cast are excellent with particular
standouts being Melissa McCarthy as Megan (in another unflinchingly
funny/awkward performance) and Chris O&#x27;Dowd as a sweet cop. However
despite the presence of a couple of male British TV stars (O&#x27;Dowd and
Matt Lucas), the women get all the best lines and even Matt Lucas is
totally outshone by his look-a-like &#x27;sister&#x27; in the film. All give
solid, believable and occasionally completely over the top
performances, but they are anchored by a sweet script that (like so
many other Judd Apatow produced/directed movies) isn&#x27;t afraid to poke
and prod at the state of people trapped in unhappy marriages.<br /><br />Paul Feig directs effectively, drawing riotous performances from the
cast and keeping the pace brusque throughout. Like many recent comedies
that are produced, directed or executive produced by Apatow, the film
is over two hours, but unlike some others, Bridesmaids does not drag or
sag after the half way mark and its story feels full and not
overburdened by an abundance of improvisation.<br /><br />The film is a sweet look at female friendships, the madness that
surrounds wedding preparation and could be seen to deal with the
pressures put on modern women to conform, succeed (in both love and
career) and above all get married! Wiig&#x27;s lovable loser clearly does
not have enough respect for herself and the audience will find
themselves rooting for her to make big changes in her life. However
Bridesmaids is a comedy; there&#x27;s no message of self-empowerment and
marriage and heterosexual romance are still held as the aspiration for
modern women.<br /><br />Aside from the overly familiar romantic comedy elements the film should
be enjoyed for the hilarious script and the performance of a brilliant
ensemble of very funny, very entertaining women. It is hugely
refreshing to see a film with female performers totally lacking in
vanity that is this rude, this vulgar and this amusing. Written by
women, starring mostly women but aimed squarely at both men and women,
Bridesmaids deserves to be a huge comedy hit.
