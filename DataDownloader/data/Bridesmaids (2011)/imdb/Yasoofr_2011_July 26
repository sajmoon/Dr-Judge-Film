This movie was so Funny it made me actually pee my pants a little. When
i went to this movie i thought it would be a normal funny movie but its
not it the BEST movie i ever watched. This movie made the hangover a
drama movie. Melissa McCarthy (megan) is the best character ever!!! The
whole cast ensemble made the movie excellent!!!!!! <br /><br />Kristen wig made an outstanding performance+ Maya Rudolph too!! Im
laughing write know as i was writing this because i remembered the
bridal shop scene. I hope this movie will be made into a sequel and win
a lot of awards because it deserves the awards. <br /><br />If your a parent and your child wants to see this movie let him watch
it there&#x27;s only one sex scene at the very beginning. Im 14 and i
watched this movie at theaters its really funny!. I went to this movie
4 times in theaters the more i watch it the more i laugh. Hope you get
to see this movie one day you really have to see this.
