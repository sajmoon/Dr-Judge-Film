This was much funnier than I expected! I was crying in laughter at some
points. It definitely had the Saturday Night Live feel to it at times
with skit-like scenes and character-driven jokes. This certainly wasn&#x27;t
a chick flick, so men would likely enjoy it despite the title. When I
saw it, the theater was filled with both men and women, and I
definitely heard laughter from both genders. Kristen Wiig&#x27;s (Annie)
character with her dry humor and side commentary, and Melissa
McCarthy&#x27;s (Megan) character with her in-your-face-but-likable manner,
were the most hilarious. Overall, despite a few slower-paced scenes
that seemed to drag the movie out a bit, this was a great one to catch
in the theaters.
