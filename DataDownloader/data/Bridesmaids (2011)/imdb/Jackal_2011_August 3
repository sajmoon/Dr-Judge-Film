I felt that this year was lacking a good comedy and this movie really
delivered. With a full female cast and randomly Irish (and cute) cop,
Chris O&#x27;Dowd it was in-your-face hilarious. It was funny in a way that
appealed to both genders with not a huge amount of &#x22;inside female&#x22;
jokes and while the patheticness of Kristen Wigg sometimes got a little
painful it worked for the movie. You feel bad for her but she&#x27;s just so
funny that you can&#x27;t help but laugh between her troubles.<br /><br />Another standout was Melissa McCarthy who delivered her low brow humor
with enthusiasm and absolutely no shame. Wait till you get to the plane
scene. Wigg is overshadowed by McCarthy&#x27;s banter with her seatmate.<br /><br />You believed in each character and they were all unique and had depth.
Even minor characters had motivation and dimension. And there were some
funny scenes... I haven&#x27;t laughed so hard I cried in a very long time
but you get to parts and you can&#x27;t believe how well it is put together.<br /><br />So go see this, if you haven&#x27;t already.
