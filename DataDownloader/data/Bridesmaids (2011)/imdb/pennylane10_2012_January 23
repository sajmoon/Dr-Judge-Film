I&#x27;m seriously shocked by all the hype surrounding &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;. I
understand the Best Picture Musical/Comedy mention at the Golden
Globes, because the competition there is always quite weak, but the
nomination for Best Picture of the year at the PGA&#x27;s? Sorry, but I
don&#x27;t get it. I didn&#x27;t dislike the film at all, though. I thought it
was a rather funny comedy with a good screenplay and better acting,
hence the relatively high mark, but that&#x27;s it! <br /><br />I admit that the scene with the teenager at the jewelery store, Annie&#x27;s
breakdown at Lillian&#x27;s bridal shower and the plane incident were
hilarious. Kristen Wiig does a really good job and carries the whole
film so well it&#x27;s astonishing, considering her lack of experience as a
leading lady. Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy are highlights as well.
The latter, though, is receiving way too much praise in my opinion for
her performance as Megan. She is definitely one of the best parts of
the film, but I think her character is too one-dimensional to be
getting that much attention.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn&#x27;t really like. First, the food-
poisoning scene. I thought it was too much and not funny at all,
actually. The other thing that didn&#x27;t do it for me was the whole
romantic storyline. I felt they gave it too much screen time and that
the film could have easily got rid of it. I would have preferred if it
had focused only in the relationships between the bridesmaids, which is
the best thing about it.<br /><br />Finally, I must dedicate a few words to Jon Hamm. How come he wasn&#x27;t
even credited? He was hilariously funny as Annie&#x27;s &#x22;sexual partner&#x22;.
Sure his screen time is reduced, but he&#x27;s a real scene-stealer!
