I&#x27;ve had very mixed feelings about this movie from the first time I saw
a poster for it in my local theater. On the one hand, I love Maya
Rudolph and Kristen Wiig and I like raunch (like the scenes with John
Hamm). OTOH, I hate scenes like the food poisoning scene. So, I wasn&#x27;t
going to go, but one of my husband&#x27;s cousins (female) said it wasn&#x27;t
that disgusting so my daughter and I went.<br /><br />We liked it, though the disgusting stuff was too much, there was enough
funny stuff that the movie almost came together. My daughter tells me
that Hangover 1 was less gross than Bridesmaids. I wish people would
pay less attention to Judd Apatow.<br /><br />The interesting thing was that most of the audience when we went to see
it was women between the ages of 40 and 60 and a few men of about the
same age. I figured the audience would have skewed much younger.<br /><br />What made the movie work for me were the scenes like the brilliant
staredown between Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne, the generally sweet
scenes between Kristen Wiig and Chris O&#x27;Dowd (what a cutie!), the scene
where Wiig knows she must dump Hamm, and even the scene when she makes
the incredible cupcake for herself, during a time when she&#x27;s swearing
to other people that she&#x27;s no longer baking. And the scenes in the
jewelry store - hysterical!<br /><br />I was also happy to see Jill Clayburgh, even if I didn&#x27;t recognize her
at first (she died not long after the film was done).<br /><br />Now, about Meghan - what bugged me about her was that she was written
and performed like Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Not all fat women, even not all
Irish fat women, act like Rosie. But, I like that Meghan was quite
successful and smart on her own, even if she was socially very awkward.
I just wish every time someone decides it&#x27;s OK to show fat people
having sex, that food wasn&#x27;t instantly involved.<br /><br />As a writer and an actress, Kristen Wiig has huge potential. I just
hope some guy doesn&#x27;t ruin her next script. Bridesmaids wasn&#x27;t ruined,
but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as it could have been.
