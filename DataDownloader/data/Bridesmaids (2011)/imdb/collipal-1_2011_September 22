Bridesmaids is a comedy with abundant vulgarity, frank discussion of
sexual subjects and adventures with a questionable common sense;
however, the subjects of friendship dealt by the screenplay, as well as
its unexpected emotional impact, put it on a different category than
the one from many contemporary comedies. And even though the result is
not a perfect film, I have to say I found it funny, satisfactory and
very entertaining.<br /><br />Even though Bridesmaids can be considered like a &#x22;chick-flick&#x22; to some
point, I think that the film is closer to the style from Judd Apatow&#x27;s
filmography (who in this case was the producer). However, every single
scene displays the sensibility from co-screenwriters Kristen Wiig and
Annie Mumolo, who besides of writing a vulgar comedy for women, also
created realistic and well defined characters with a wide evolutionary
potential. The main character from Bridesmaids (Annie) shapes the film
and brings the necessary emotional component to impulse the story. On
that way, the scenes with scatological comedy or slapstick take a very
interesting dimension; as an example, I can point out the visit to the
elegant dressmaker where the ladies will try their dresses on; I will
not say how the scene ends, but it simultaneously works as a grotesque
joke, as a hard shock to Annie&#x27;s frail self-esteem, and as a point for
her rival Helen. In other words, what makes the laughs from this film
satisfactory is the fact that they are an integral part of the
narrative.<br /><br />And besides of that, I have to mention the excellent performances,
starting by Wiig&#x27;s, who takes absolute possession of her character and
makes the spectator to empathize with her. Besides, she has such a good
chemistry with Maya Rudolph, that the long friendship shared by their
characters is absolutely credible. As for the character Helen, instead
of making her a typical pre-fabricated villain, Rose Byrne brought
humanity to her and makes her a figure of an ambiguous intention. And
Melissa McCarthy steals the show, because she brings such a pure and
sincere personality to her character which does not only feel funny,
but also even touching.<br /><br />Director Paul Feig wisely drives the movie with a minimum stylish
interference, letting the scenes to develop to their own rhythm and
allowing them to extend themselves to see if the actresses find some
improvised moment which adds unexpected laughs or lightens some
melodramatic scene. However, at the same time, that makes a few scenes
to get a bit repetitive (for examples, the problems on board of a
plane). Besides, I think that the characters Rita and Becca had comic
potential which was not enough explored.<br /><br />Despite those complains I have, I enjoyed Bridesmaids pretty much, and
I can recommend it as a genuinely funny comedy whose occasional
vulgarity does not interfere with its narrative duties nor with the
feelings it expresses without falling into the cheap sentimentality.
And I have not even mentioned the romantic aspect, which I found
soberly managed and not cloying at all. Oh! And the excellent
soundtrack full of female rock.
