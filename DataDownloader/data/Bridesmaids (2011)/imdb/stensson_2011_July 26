This film has reached big audiences in the US and has also been
commented on the newspaper&#x27;s culture sections. Another kind of girl
movie, it has been said.<br /><br />But the difference is maybe just the fact that the women here are doing
the same things as guys have in just too many movies. There are the
common stereotypes. The girls who have known each other since
childhood, the disgusting and mean rich bitch, the overweight woman who
anyway is &#x22;a real person&#x22;. They get food-poisoned, drunk and have
conflicts. You&#x27;ve seen it before, but that was about guys.<br /><br />Certainly there are funny scenes and Kristen Wiig is very good
including much warmth. But calling this feminist, as some people have
done, is going too far.
