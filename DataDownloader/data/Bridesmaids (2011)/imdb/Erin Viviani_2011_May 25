Bridesmaids is a very funny movie of all times! I kept laughing the
whole time when it came to jokes. I also thought the movie was
HILARIOUS!!! The movie was packed so I didn&#x27;t really focus at the
beginning because I was looking for a seat but the beginning wasn&#x27;t
really a major part in the movie. The movie will absolutely not get
boring even for a second or two. The women in this movie are naughty
and funny. Sometimes, I would feel sorry for the main characters at
some time. I would recommend this movie to people who love comedies,
romance, and naughty bits. There is a lot of things going on this
movie. I give it a 10. You absolutely need to see this movie!
