The soulfully, relatable comedy is nicely blended with over the top
crass, crude humor. The amusingly unique movie plays out from the
female standpoint and mentality and that differs from movies of this
kind that are typically based upon the male psyche. It is up there with
the best of the irreverent, nasty comedies of this genre such as the
Hangover, Knocked up and Superbad. <br /><br />By creating a cynical theme, due to the melancholy, jealousy and
nihilism that the friend believably feels from the occurrence of her
bff getting married, a crass/slapstick comedy evolves into a dark and
sophisticated one. When a Bff gets married resulting in the inevitable
&#x22;growing apart&#x22; while at the same time the friend not getting married
feels as though she is going nowhere a soulfully bluesy mood resonates.
The acting amongst the main characters, especially their connection
with each other was well done. <br /><br />The assortment of side characters and bridesmaids were well developed.
We really cared about these supporting characters since their own
histories, and idiosyncratic personality traits created complex
eccentrically believable personas. Especially amusing were the heavy
set bridesmaid and the policeman. <br /><br />Finally the typical plague that frequently decimates movies of the
genre, the overlong sappy &#x22;tie things neatly together&#x22; moments, did not
go on too long. Instead what was wisely focused on was crude, slapstick
humor, developed side characters and real connections between friends.
