Lot of people said this is woman version of &#x27;Hangover&#x27; i&#x27;m pretty sure
they said it before they watch this. there are few similarities between
&#x27;Hangover &#x26; Bridesmaids&#x22; but this is not that fun ride.<br /><br />I like to categorize this to &#x22;dramatic ,comedy&#x22; yep first &#x22;dramatic&#x22;
then &#x22;comedy&#x22; it takes you half a way but then leave you there and with
lot of unbelievably weird characters.<br /><br />i expected lot from this but it turned out drama about weird and failed
women&#x27;s life with some funny moments but mixed with sad story and
&#x22;Annie&#x27;s (Kristen Wiig) acting bit over the top or too dramatic (i
think character writers responsible for that). I can&#x27;t find that great
feeling i had with &#x22;Hangover&#x22; not even close . so don&#x27;t bring &#x22;Hangover
&#x22; and &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; to the same track .But you will find &#x22;Alan&#x27;s&#x22;
female version ;) <br /><br />This had chance to get lot better but that stupid scene (you will find
out what i&#x27;m talking about ) changed/turned everything ,i have no idea
why they did that. sure this explaining women&#x27;s lives and touching
their hearts but they categorizing this to a comedy is very
disappointing .. maybe less weird characters make this more funnier .<br /><br />i&#x27;ll give this 5/10 , one time watch &#x26; not a bad movie this is a
average chick flick with lot of hype ,if they going to make part 2 i&#x27;m
sure it will follow &#x22;Sex and city 2&#x22;
