Saw this movie with a cinema full of females due to a Chick Flick night
at the local movie theatre. This movie was hilariously funny. It made
me (and the rest of the theatre) laugh, cry and &#x22;awww&#x22;. There were no
parts where you wanted to skip forward a chapter (like in some books)to
get to see what happened. There was no waiting for the next interesting
bit to start! Just continuous laughter throughout the theatre. Best
movie I&#x27;ve seen in... as long as I can remember! The SNL girls were all
amazing. Full of a cast that I hardly knew (besides Rose Byrne), I was
extremely impressed with the turnout! The shorts for the film
definitely don&#x27;t do the movie justice! Highly recommended watch!<br /><br />Warning though: You do need to be able to take the swearing and the
cringeworthy bits, or it won&#x27;t be your cup of tea!
