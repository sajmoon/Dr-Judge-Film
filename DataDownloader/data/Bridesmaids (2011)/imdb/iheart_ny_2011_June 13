I know I&#x27;m a little late on reviewing this one, I was going to just axe
my review altogether. However, Bridesmaids is a film that is simply too
good to be ignored. The reason for this is because it so easily could
have been a bad movie. It could have been fake, and unrealistic, it
could have featured paper-thin characters with no depth. It could have
had a lousy script, with PG-13-friendly antics and adventures. It
could&#x27;ve featured ridiculous product placement, and could have involved
no realistic conflict, with an even more unrealistic conclusion. <br /><br />However, it really doesn&#x27;t do any of these things.<br /><br />Bridesmaids has a great line of actresses that make the cut, in every
possible way, and proves that women can truly be funny, instead of
portraying them, as they easily could have, as whiny bitches. Kristen
Wiig is a comedic genius. She co-writes the script, alongside Annie
Mumolo (who appears in the film as a jittery passenger on a plane, look
for her), and these two ladies bring a hell of a lot to the table. <br /><br />Kristen Wiig, while having written a beautifully nuanced script that&#x27;s
funny, yet relatable, and therefore, a bit sad, is the star of the show
here. She plays Annie, a lovelorn, broke, and generally unhappy woman
whose best friend is getting married, and asks her to be the maid of
honor. Whilst dealing with the bizarre and expensive rituals that come
with that duty, her life begins to unravel. Friends, love, work, and
life, in general begin to blur, and the mistakes of her past become
full circle. She&#x27;s a genuine character, she&#x27;s not a clich&#xE9;. As are the
rest of the woman in this terrific film.<br /><br />Maya Rudolph (another SNL favourite) plays Wiig&#x27;s best friend Lillian,
who&#x27;s in the middle of planning a wedding, and begins to drift from her
lifelong best friend, Annie. Rose Byrne (who I love in Damages) has a
surprisingly apparent comedic side, playing Helen, a member of the
bridal party, who is Lillian&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;e&#x27;s boss&#x27;s wife (or something like
that), and she is essentially the woman who&#x27;s (possibly inadvertently)
trying to destroy Annie and Lillian&#x27;s friendship.<br /><br />Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911! fame), gives a hilariously deadpan
performance as Rita, a relative who is sarcastic, embittered, and
generally dissatisfied in her marriage and resents her three sons. She
clicks with Becca (Ellie Kemper, of The Office), a newlywed, who is
extremely enthusiastic about becoming a wife and mother, who claims to
have been &#x22;so distraught&#x22; when she was single. <br /><br />Rounding out the bridal party is Melissa McCarthy (of Gilmore Girls,
and now Mike &#x26; Molly) as Megan, the groom&#x27;s sister. She&#x27;s the oddball
of the group, being decidedly more rough-around-the-edges as the rest
of the ladies. While she appears to be for this movie, what Zach
Gilifinakis was in The Hangover, she is given room, as are the rest of
the ladies, to make exciting, complex, and rewarding characters. But
McCarthy is probably the funniest one of the bunch. <br /><br />It&#x27;s already being referred to as the woman&#x27;s answer to &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;,
or &#x22;Hangover in Heels&#x22;, which I don&#x27;t agree with. First of all, I
didn&#x27;t really like &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. For me, it was impossible to root
for those four jackasses who weren&#x27;t genuine, and felt clich&#xE9;d and
ridiculous. While this film certainly has its crude sequences, it&#x27;s
more about friendship, and how to react to things that happen in life
that are not ideal. It&#x27;s about how a friendship can survive whatever
punches that are thrown at it.<br /><br />The fact that each of these ladies are given room to make great
characters makes this film as good as it is. Given that they don&#x27;t
really whine, and they prove that women ARE funny, and can be
hilarious, sets it apart from any other film like this, that has been
made in the last decade. It also sets the bar for any R-rated American
comedy to be released in 2011. Bring on the sequel.
