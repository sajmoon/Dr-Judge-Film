Okay, i just registered right now so that i could write a review on
this movie. It was suggested by two ex-friends, who i will now call
acquaintances because they let me waste my money. That is not what
friends do! That being said, this movie definitely has a few laughs
here and there, but i probably forced myself to laugh because i went
into the theater thinking it&#x27;s a comedy. I feel as if the whole movie
was forced into comedy, although i think it would have been a great
movie had they made it more into a drama. I think the blond girl (dont
know name) definitely did act well, i was sad for her when she was
going through the stuff and i would have loved to see her get her life
back together.<br /><br />I definitely think the humor they used has been done to death, like
food poisoning, going in the bathroom in your pants etc etc. It is
worth a watch, ONCE. Only if you pay less then $3 for it, but
definitely not worth watching at the movies.<br /><br />I give it a two star (can&#x27;t see the start for me to submit??)
