This movie does divide people. It is very foul mouthed and it does not
care if you like the language or the way the characters act in it. I do
respect if people feel offended by it. Unfortunately that will cloud
their view of the underlying themes in this. Just because it is crass
and vulgar, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s pointless.<br /><br />Quite the opposite is the case. You have strong themes of friendship,
envy and growing older to bare (well our characters have to bare those
things). Not to mention the whole wedding thing, that is quite a big
deal for every woman. I didn&#x27;t enjoy every joke, but I liked the way
women handled themselves in this. Our main character has an arch and
you can clearly see her progress through the whole film (and all the
jokes).<br /><br />Again, if you are easily offended this is not for you. Don&#x27;t expect it
to be a female Hangover either. And then you might enjoy it too :o)
