World, meet Kristen Wiig. Kristen Wiig, meet world. This is one
uncommonly hilarious actress delivering a performance (of a script that
she co-wrote with Annie Mumolo) that should endear her to audiences
from here to Jupiter. In Bridesmaids, she elevates an otherwise
formulaic comedy to heights of unqualified enjoyability.<br /><br />Wiig plays Annie, a failed baker who is slouching away behind the
counter of a jewelry store and having occasional romps with a
self-obsessed hunk (the ever-dashing Jon Hamm) who would sooner perform
an underwater shark-flossing than commit to a relationship. She had
hoped for more, but she has resigned herself to taking what she can
get. She agrees to be the maid-of-honor in the wedding of her childhood
bestie Lillian (played by Maya Rodulph), accepting all the rights,
duties, and catty craziness implied therein. Her fellow bridesmaids
make up a colorful assortment of amusing personalities. Not the least
of these is Megan (played by the scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy) who
suggests enthusiastically that the bridal shower be fight club themed.
Annie is immediately upstaged by Helen (Rose Byrne), Lillian&#x27;s
sickly-sweet and effortlessly gorgeous friend from her fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s job.
She&#x27;s fashionable, rich, and endlessly capable of making Annie feel
hopelessly inadequate.<br /><br />The group embarks on a journey towards matrimony that is filled with
that winning combination of raunchy gags and tenderness that has become
synonymous with the Apatow brand (Judd Apatow, the writer and director
of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, worked as a producer on this
film). Bridesmaids takes the Hollywood assumption that female
characters in comedies must be sweet, supportive of, and secondary to
their male counterparts and drops a deuce on it. Jokes about explosive
diarrhea and projectile puking aren&#x27;t just for the men anymore. Wiig
and her fellow funny-women embrace the sorts of gross-out gags that
would make the Farrely brothers blush and the results are
side-splitting.<br /><br />But the movie never loses sight of the relational heart at its core.
Director Paul Feig cultivates a sensitive balance between situational
antics and the emotional center of the story. In less attentive hands,
McCarthy&#x27;s Megan could have been nothing more than another punch-line
but she is instead allowed unexpected depth. Wigg imbues Annie with an
air of magnetic unselfconsciousness that makes her sympathetic as she
struggles to overcome one failure after another. Her jerky relationship
with a charmingly affable Irish cop (Chris O&#x27;Dowd) develops naturally
and is thoroughly satisfying as a result. These are well drawn
characters being played by more-than-capable actors.<br /><br />Of these it is Wiig&#x27;s star that shines brightest. Her comic energy
combined with surprising dramatic chops result in a performance and a
film that is irresistibly likable. Take your bow, Kristen Wiig, those
cheers are for you.
