The high expectations of Bridesmaids really lets it down. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong, the film is genuinely quite funny, but knowing when those funny
bits are from the trailers and reviews just lessens their impact. It&#x27;s
almost as if you&#x27;re thinking &#x22;Ok I know I have to laugh in a minute&#x22;. <br /><br />The characters are introduced well at the start and they make you more
interested in the plot, but some of them disappear halfway through the
film when they could be used a lot more; they&#x27;re definitely needed.
Chris O&#x27;Dowd is one of the best actors in the movie though the acting
throughout is quite good for a comedy. <br /><br />One other thing that makes the film slightly less powerful, is that the
main character isn&#x27;t really introduced very well at the start so you
don&#x27;t sympathise with her later on in the plot. <br /><br />Altogether Bridesmaids is a good watch for anyone who likes comedy,
just don&#x27;t expect too much from it.
