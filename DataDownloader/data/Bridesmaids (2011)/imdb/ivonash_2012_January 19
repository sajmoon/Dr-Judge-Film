The movie gives us a wonderfully presented glimpse into female
friendships, their fickleness, their fragility, their volatile nature,
their foundations, and their strength. All the actors and actresses,
even the most minor ones, play their roles in such a way that they make
it possible for the viewer to forget they aren&#x27;t real people in the
real world.<br /><br />The comical aspects aren&#x27;t forced, they emerge and arise naturally from
the plot&#x27;s development. The scenes with sexual banter and/or bodily
functions aren&#x27;t the basis of the movie&#x27;s humoristic side; they&#x27;re
merely a backdrop adding an &#x22;Oh my!&#x22; to the overall atmosphere.
