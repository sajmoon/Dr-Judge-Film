A movie for women, about women, and by women. Well, make that last one
written by women but directed and produced with the Paul Feig and Judd
Apatow touch. This means that we get comedy and emotion in equal parts.
But it also means that we get perverted humour, clich&#xE9; cat-fights, and
sweet romance.<br /><br />Some of the requisite inclusions like trying on bridesmaids dresses,
which incorporates the perverted humour, are absolutely hilarious.
While some of the requisite girl fights are stupid, ridiculous, and
completely unrealistic. Realism may not be something they&#x27;re aiming for
here, but it&#x27;s funnier when it&#x27;s true.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is more about Annie (Kristen Wiig) than the other
bridesmaids. A better title would have been &#x22;Kristin Wiig Before the
Wedding&#x22;. Wiig is best known for &#x22;Saturday Night Live&#x22;, and they do
take a lot traits from SNL, live over-using Wiig, having scenes last
longer than they should, but at least the majority of them are funny.
Thankfully the other featured bridesmaid is played by Melissa McCarthy.
She is given the best character, the funniest lines, and proves how
good of a comedic actress she is.<br /><br />Undeniably, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is hilarious, but the ridiculously high
critics&#x27; rating really just suggests that men love it when women swear.
It&#x27;s funny but it&#x27;s not brilliant.
