A very funny movie, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is more than just a female take on
&#x22;The Hangover.&#x22; Although the movie did contain some thematically
Hangover-like elements (general silliness and buffoonery), one scene in
particular&#x97;and I&#x27;m talking about the scene when the bridesmaids all go
shopping for their dresses after having dined at a questionable
Brazilian restaurant&#x97;manages to outgross even some of the raunchiest
&#x22;guy&#x22; movies. Kristen Wiig is hilarious (as always) as the main
character whose life is spiraling to rock-bottom (loser
boyfriend&#x97;played by an uncredited Jon Hamm at his absolute smarmiest,
lousy job, bizarre roommates) just as her bff (Maya Rudolph) is
planning her wedding with the assistance of a new buttinsky bff, played
with appropriately haughty aplomb by Rose Byrne. Melissa McCarthy is
offensively hilarious as the earthy sister-of-the-groom who lacks any
sense of tact, and Jill Clayburgh (in her final film role) is quirkily
earnest as Wiig&#x27;s mom. Although the film devolves somewhat into a
typical happily-ever-after master narrative (Wiig&#x27;s character really
can&#x27;t be happy until she finds a man&#x97;luckily, that man is played by the
handsome and charming Irish actor Chris O&#x27;Dowd), its sharp sense of
humor and caustic wit definitely make it worth seeing. And just try to
resist singing along to Wilson Phillips&#x27; &#x22;Hold On&#x22; during the wedding
scene.
