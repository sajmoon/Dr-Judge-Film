Sorry, didn&#x27;t have the patience to sit out for this pretentious movie.
First of all, the so-called &#x22;best friends&#x22; didn&#x27;t play convincingly as
best friends, they didn&#x27;t look or act like good friends, even their
facial looks and expressions didn&#x27;t ring true to show that they could
be very good friends. I really don&#x27;t know how these critics and movie
goers would consider this is a good movie, maybe hearing women&#x27;s &#x22;wise
crackings&#x22; are so exciting, because usually wisecracking is the words
from the male? Not long ago we have a very boring movie, &#x22;The
Romantics&#x22;, also got the similar scenario and storyline, a bunch of
male and female alumni as best friends all invited to participate a
wedding and it turned out to be a vicious back-stabbing debacle. That
amateurish and so-called best friends&#x27; wedding is no different from
this &#x22;Bridemaids&#x22;, but this one also sucks big time in my opinion; I
might have to bang my head on the wall to turn myself into a moron to
watch this pathetic movie. After viewed it about 30 minutes my wife
finally lost her patience, pushed me with her elbow and suggested:
&#x22;This movie looks so pretentious and shallow, could we just leave now?&#x22;
&#x22;Thought you&#x27;d never ask!&#x22; I responded. So, another several ten dollar
bills were down the drain. Those movie critics, I really want to kick
their behinds.
