Have not laughed this much in a move for a long time.<br /><br />Took my female friend, I&#x27;m a guy, to see this movie as she has been
wanting to see it. Heard good things about it.<br /><br />We saw it at a second run theatre and it was still very well attended.<br /><br />This is a very funny movie from the female perspective, which is a
refreshing take as many recent wedding movies have been from the male
perspective. It is male friendly, in that the jokes are not too much
inside jokes only women would get. There may have been a few but
everyone enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is a very funny movie. There are a lot of jokes tossed around and a
few are easy to miss. The foul language was used to make a joke or a
point, it was not like some films that just cuss to establish a &#x22;tough&#x22;
character, here it was for comedic affect.<br /><br />The ensemble cast each was a different personality that a person would
have to deal with in a wedding party. The writing really worked the
dynamics well to provide character development that lead to more
laughs. It was over the top at times, but intentionally so and did not
take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Go see it with friends. You will have a good laugh-out-loud time and
something to talk about afterwards. There is something to be said about
experiencing a good comedy in a movie theatre with other people. It is
more enjoyable when you are laughing with other people. Know I probably
embarrassed my friend by how loud I was laughing and spilled our drink
from a &#x22;OMG she did not just say that&#x22; moment.<br /><br />There is one extra scene after the movie ends before the credits. Was
hoping there was something after the credits as it is becoming more
common, but unfortunately it was all before the credits and after the
movie.
