What&#x27;s that? You don&#x27;t know any of these people? Okay, surely you know
Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph from SNL right? You don&#x27;t? You&#x27;re a sad,
poor pathetic monkey if you don&#x27;t even know at least one of these
people....<br /><br />If you don&#x27;t know them...you better get used to them because these
women are comic gold. That&#x27;s right...I said it... GOLD... especially
Wiig. Why, you ask? Because she not only stars in this masterpiece --
she also wrote it. Oh, have I got your attention now? I thought so.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t need to explain the movie --- the synopsis states it pretty
damn clear. I mean, really. Annie (Wiig) is broke but wants to give her
best friend since grade school (Rudolph) the best bride-to-be
experience she can on her very limited budget. A &#x27;newbie friend&#x27;
(Byrne) outshines her in every single category... and let&#x27;s face it,
guys..... everyone has a breaking point, am I right? Thank goodness
that WE are all private individuals who live private lives. I mean...
who wants to be there on display when something goes horribly wrong?
Count me in if it consists of this hilarious supporting cast. I don&#x27;t
even mind that we get swayed from the main storyline about the
wedding.... because the interactions between Annie and her sibling
roommates (Wilson and Lucas) and her d*ckhead boss (Hitchcock) make
this story even MORE fun.<br /><br />That&#x27;s what this review is all about... not spoiling a damn thing. You
might leave this article saying... &#x27;he didn&#x27;t say what the movie is
about&#x27;..... oh really? It&#x27;s pretty clear what it&#x27;s about --- it&#x27;s about
2 hours long and worth every damn penny -- you want story? Then read
the frickin&#x27; synopsis.... I&#x27;m not about to spoil any surprises in what
is clearly gonna be one of this year&#x27;s best comedies.<br /><br />More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: A
