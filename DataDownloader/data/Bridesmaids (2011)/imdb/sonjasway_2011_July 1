The only redeeming parts of this movie were the ones without the other
women! A couple of scenes with Kristen Wiig alone were sweet - the ones
that weren&#x27;t attempting to be funny. But as it&#x27;s marketed as a comedy
for and about women and as that it is a massive failure. Does anyone in
this generation have the ability to tell a story without attempting to
make jokes out of masturbation and bodily functions? This was supposed
to be a comedy for women, not 12 year old boys. It takes real skill and
a real story to make those things truly funny and not just lame and
sad. I have never felt the need to write a review before but the fact
that I saw this rated as a 7 something and read a reviews that said
this was hilarious upset me. What a waste of film! Don&#x27;t waste your
time or money on this title.
