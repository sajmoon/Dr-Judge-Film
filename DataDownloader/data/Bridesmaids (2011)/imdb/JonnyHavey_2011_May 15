&#x22;Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable&#x22; Director Paul Feig and Producer
Judd Apatow have successfully created a romantic comedy that breaks
through the usual limitations and rules of the genre. Bridesmaids
proves that women can be as raunchy as men releasing the ridiculous
upon audiences in original fashion backed by heart. Kristen Wiig has
finally proved that she is much more than the goof seen on Saturday
Night Live jumping to the top of the comedy genre brining the buddy
comedy to the feminine arena. Wiig stars as a thirty-something year old
women named Annie whose life is headed on a downward spiral. Her
roommates are impossible to live with, her job sucks and her love life
is nonexistent except for meaningless sexual escapades with a man named
Ted (Jon Hamm, The Town). To top it off her best friend Lillian (Maya
Rudolph, Away We Go) puts things into perspective when telling Annie
she is getting married. On the bright side, Lillian has chosen Annie to
be her Maid of Honor giving Annie something worth working for. Annie&#x27;s
excitement doesn&#x27;t last long as she meets Lillian&#x27;s diverse bridesmaids
choices, Megan (Melissa McCarthy, CBS&#x27;s Mike and Molly ), Becca (Ellie
Kemper, NBC&#x27;s The Office), and Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey, Reno 911!:
Miami) along with Helen (Rose Byrne, Get Him to the Greek) who uses her
wealth and power to takeover as Maif of Honor. Annie has hit bottom and
with the support of a police officer named Rhodes (Chris O&#x27;Dowd,
Gulliver&#x27;s Travels) and the antics of female relationships, she embarks
on a hilarious yet meaningful journey to rediscover herself. <br /><br />Bridesmaids differentiates itself from the rom-com stereotype with the
clever clich&#xE9;-free scriptwriting of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. No
matter how outrageous the jokes become, they are smart, fun and
unbelievably believable. Consequently, the film controls the outrage
allowing the humor to improve the story and support the almost perfect
Apatow cast. For example, Melissa McCarthy acts like a complete idiot
racking up the laughs giving male raunch a run for its money. However,
the stand out performance and the best performance of an actress this
year so far comes from Kristen Wiig&#x27;s multidimensional melding of
comedy and drama.<br /><br />How do you complain about a movie as unique as Bridesmaids? Well first
audiences expecting to see a chick flick have no idea what they are
getting themselves into and if they cannot take the raunch it is going
to be a painful two hours. Also, while the film is titled Bridesmaids,
viewers may expect a story based around more than one woman, when in
actuality it is not. Even so, the only real problem with the film is
its song and dance happy ending, undermining what could have been a
great finale.<br /><br />Comedies bordering the two-hour mark usually have a hard time
engrossing the audience as the jokes run thin and the drama ensues,
however, Bridesmaids&#x27; comedy becomes smarter and smarter giving each of
the bridesmaids a matrimonial purpose in Wiig&#x27;s fasttrack to the
A-List.
