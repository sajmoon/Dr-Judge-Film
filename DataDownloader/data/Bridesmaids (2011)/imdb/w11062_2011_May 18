Has some funny scenes. Airplane scene is good. Has some overly dramatic
scenes that don&#x27;t fit in. A vulgar scene at the bridal shop wasn&#x27;t
funny. Wiig&#x27;s character is unlikable at times. She&#x27;s upset too much.
Wiig goes over the top a lot.She fights with her friends and throws
tantrums that were uncomfortable. Movie is too long. Should have been
90 min instead of 2 hours. A lot of scenes don&#x27;t work. Not a great
movie. Final scene was nice. Melissa McCarty is funny. Chris O&#x27;Dowd is
good. Sad to see the late Jill Clayburgh in her final role. If you and
your wife or girlfriend need to go out and do something, you won&#x27;t
regret it. Thank you.
