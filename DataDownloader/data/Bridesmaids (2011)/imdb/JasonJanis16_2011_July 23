First off I&#x27;m a guy, I wanted to see it more than my girlfriend, and we
saw it in a group in a packed theatre. Everyone one of us was blown
away at how good this movie is. I haven&#x27;t heard anyone talk bad of it
until I began reading reviews on here. Wtf is wrong with you people?!
You don&#x27;t find this funny then go read a book about the origins of pi.
You people must have had a lobotomy or something. If you like family
guy /hangover/ futurama/ Simpsons, etc. You will love this movie. Yes
it has some crude, poop, humor parts, but so what? If you are an adult
who can&#x27;t handle jokes about poo (fecal matter) then what the hell is
wrong with you? Hint, everybody poos, get over it. I loved the set up,
the scene on the airplane and puppy parts &#x22;I&#x27;m really more of a six
puppy person.&#x22; if you&#x27;re older than 13 and younger than 60 you SHOULD
be able to handle the style of comedy and laugh you arse off. Hope so,
cheers.
