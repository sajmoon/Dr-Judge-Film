Faithfully married to a series of realistically hilarious misadventures
starring a medley of uniquely amusing women, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; proposes an
exclusive look into the unvarnished truth that hides behind a seemingly
classy and tamed circle of female friends. Unlike the other so- called
chick flicks, this one divorces any subterfuge that could inhibit the
viewer from witnessing the pukey, uncouth and utterly exposed sight
untainted by fairytale cosmetics so commonly used and abused in these
types of films. Every single layer of &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is carefully
examined in such a way as to reveal the almost unnoticeable yet
existent folds and rough marks that are indivisibly sown on the female
fabric. Beyond magnifying these subtleties, the film is cleverly able
to always get a laugh out of every mishap thrown in the way of this
wolf pack of crudely enchanting ladies. From the neurotically envious
Annie (Kristen Wiig) to the placidly insidious Helen (Rose Byrne),
there is clearly a multivariate spectrum of talented actresses that all
shine through in their own way. When confronted with the question: &#x22;Do
you take &#x27;Bridesmaids&#x27; as your thoughtfully decided film selection,&#x22; a
simple &#x22;I do&#x22; is assuredly the most adequate response.
