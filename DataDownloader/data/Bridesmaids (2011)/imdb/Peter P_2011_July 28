In my entire life I haven&#x27;t been so much annoyed and irritated by a
movie! Needless to say, my girlfriend and I walked out after 1 hour
(the whole movie is about 2 hours long!) This movie is literally
fart-poop-vomit &#x27;&#x27;comedy&#x22; with no plot, poor acting, and no point at
all. After one hour (with constantly getting worse over time) this
movie reached the point in which bridesmaids are vomiting in close
shots all over the place and over each other in the fancy bridal shop!!
What can I say? At that point I took it as an insult to the audience,
who has been so shamefully cheated by the trailers and false marketing
to buy the tickets for a &#x27;&#x27;romantic comedy&#x22;. Instead, we got this
disgusting and terrible movie which is a total waste of money and time
and an insult to the common sense, after all. As another reviewer said:
giving this movie 1 out of 10 can be considered generous!
