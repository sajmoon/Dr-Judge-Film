I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from Bridesmaids. An all female comedy is
the kind of film that would not normally appeal to me but thankfully
Bridesmaids turned out to be on of the funniest films i have seen in
the past 12 months.<br /><br />The story revolves around Annie , who&#x27;s life seems to be passing her by
while her best friend , Lillian is getting married . Although Annie is
a lifelong friend of Lillian ,a new friend Helen has come along and has
decided to plan the wedding to the horror of Annie.<br /><br />If you thought the first Hangover film was funny then let me tell you ,
this was much funnier. Some of the scenes had me laughing out loud and
the one where they get food poisoning in the wedding dress shop had me
in tears.<br /><br />Kirsten Wiig is brilliant in the lead role and she really shows what a
talented comedienne she is. There are some cameo rolls from Matt Lucas
and Chris O&#x27;Dowd that are impressive too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
