Annie(Kristen Wiig) is thrilled to be maid of honor at best friends
wedding, she is Lillian(Maya Rudolph), someone that Annie has known
since forever. But this flattery doesn&#x27;t last, when Annie meets
Helen(Rose Byne), Lillian other friend, and she is very rich, and Annie
starts to feel like she being kicked to the curbed. She also meets the
other bridesmaids, Megan(Melissa McCarthy), Becca(Ellie Kemper),
Rita(Wendi Mclendon-Covey).<br /><br />You just gotta call this the female hangover, it was fun ride, it is
pretty funny. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy pretty much took this
movie, the others where alright, but Wiig and McCarthy are up there
with Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, and Steve Carrell.
