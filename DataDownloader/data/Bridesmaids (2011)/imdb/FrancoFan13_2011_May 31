I admit, I only went to see this film because of Kristin Wiig and Maya
Rudolph. I&#x27;m a HUGE SNL fan. But after watching the movie, I really
enjoyed it. It wasn&#x27;t overly funny because they managed to balance the
film out with a serious tone. I thought that Kristin and Maya
compliment each other&#x27;s comedic talents perfectly. I loved how it was
witty funny. The improvisation brought the film together. I also really
liked the message and the focus of the film. That friends always stick
together no matter where in life they are, a true friend is always
there for you. So if you have a best friend go take them to see it! I
also loved how it&#x27;s not just a chick movie. I saw a couple fellas in
the theatre (not with any girls!) and they were laughing just as much
as we were. Its classic slapstick comedy done right. I would definitely
watch it again.
