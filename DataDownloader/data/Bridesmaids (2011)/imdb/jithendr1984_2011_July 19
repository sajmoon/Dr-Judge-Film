Went to watch this with my girlfriend, I expected this to be good.<br /><br />The only funny/fitting character in this movie the the large girl. <br /><br />Some of the characters are mildly entertaining but the main character
really cannot act. There really is no story line here, its quite
predictably trying to implement a female version of &#x27;The hangover&#x27; and
failing.<br /><br />I found it hard to understand why some people were laughing for some
bits of this movie, I believe it may be tuned to a very American sense
of humor.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t remember the last time I paid to see such bad acting. The movie
is overall quite depressing and painful.
