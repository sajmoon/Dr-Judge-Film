Bridesmaids was always a film that was doomed, in my opinion, to get a
lot of negative attention. Firstly, it&#x27;s an almost all-female led
production in a field (comedy) now considered to be the almost
exclusive preserve of the guys. Secondly, it&#x27;s yet another female-led
film that centres around the world of weddings. Holy smokes, wasn&#x27;t
Bride Wars enough already? If anyone is still thinking along these
lines, you&#x27;re missing out. Bridesmaids features a lot of women, yes,
but these aren&#x27;t the man-hating shrews or the pony-loving simps
Hollywood so often serves up. These are women like you, me, your sister
or your mum, profiled with gentle affection and scathing wit. This is a
movie that puts realistic and flawed characters into increasingly
extreme situations and plays off real tensions and authentic reactions,
all while poking fun at the roiling juggernaut that is the wedding
industry. Obviously, a fair share of the humour is based around female
interaction, and that&#x27;s where the movie gets it&#x27;s heart, but at the end
of the day Wiig and Mumolo&#x27;s creations are funny regardless of gender.
And if you/your boy really can&#x27;t bear to sit through a film without
fart jokes, well, there&#x27;s a healthy dose of them thrown in for good
luck.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig is adorable as Annie, the confidence-lacking protagonist
and sometime maid-of honour whose struggles with various aspects of her
life form the backbone of the story. Watching her stumble erratically
from one well-intentioned disaster to the next is both hilarious and
painful. It&#x27;s hard to deny that Annie suffers from terrible luck, but
as we see during the film, her own attitude means that she frequently
manages to make her bad luck worse. Audiences will either love Annie,
because she reminds them of their own weaknesses, or they&#x27;ll hate her,
because she reminds them of their own weaknesses. Maya Rudolph&#x27;s
Lillian provides the perfect foil, bringing an air of quiet dignity and
optimism to contrast with Annie&#x27;s cynicism <br /><br />The supporting characters are equally well drawn and cast; special
mention to Jon Hamm&#x27;s almost gleeful turn as hot-but-hideous misogynist
Ted, and Melissa McCarthy&#x27;s impossible to forget (in almost every
sense) Megan. But some of the less provocative characters are also
among the best; not enough mention IMO has gone to Rose Byrne. Helen is
a character set up from the beginning to absorb most of the audience&#x27;s
dislike, and it&#x27;s thanks to Byrne&#x27;s subtle performance that the role
doesn&#x27;t descend into caricature and that Helen ultimately ends up
receiving a fair share of the audiences&#x27; sympathy. The late Jill
Clayburgh simply IS everyone&#x27;s eternal mom, serving up sympathy and
tough love in a velveteen glove.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few problems. Some of the gross-out humour
spills into the tiresome, and some of the casting is a bit out-there.
I&#x27;m guessing mainstream American audiences will be thrown by the
presence of Irish comedian Chris O&#x27;Dowd as a main love-interest, which
is a shame as his performance is great; acerbic, sweet and goofy all at
the same time. It&#x27;s the performance he&#x27;s needed to give since leaving
TV&#x27;s IT Crowd, and here&#x27;s hoping it will bring him further roles to
stretch his stuff in. <br /><br />By and large, however, Bridesmaid&#x27;s is the funniest film I&#x27;ve seen at
the cinema in a long while. It&#x27;s both authentic and original, something
we haven&#x27;t had for too long in a cinema scene dominated by nth degree
sequels and parodies.
