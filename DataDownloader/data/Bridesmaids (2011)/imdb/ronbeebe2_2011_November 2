this movie is off-the-hook funny. If you don&#x27;t enjoy it you either live
in a cave or under a rock. 10 out of 10 stars. And don&#x27;t think this
kind of drama does not happen in reality - it happens, every day. More
surprising is which characters take the movie and run with it. Although
the main character (the blonds) is SNL-funny in her own right, the
heavy set sidekick is truly a gem in this one. NOT family friendly, but
extremely funny nonetheless. One of our favorite movies in years past
was Super Troopers and this movie literally plays along the smae lines
(meow). I am certain they will have a sequel as this movie still has
plenty of humor left on the table.
