Movie critics are supposed to be the ultimate arbiters of cinematic
taste. The stereotypical image of critic is one of a dead-eyed, cynical
intellectual, looking down his nose at the mere trifles before him.
This is the image I have to live up to: high-minded, snooty, and
highfalutin. So, what can I do with something like Bridesmaids, a film
so decidedly low class, brimming with fart jokes, innuendo, and other
aberrations? Well, if the experience of seeing it proves anything, all
I can do is laugh breathlessly and wonder when the barrage of laughter
will stop. In the case of Bridesmaids, it never stops. Here is a movie
you watch twice &#x96; first because it&#x27;s good, and then again to hear all
the lines you missed because you were laughing breathlessly at the
previous exchange. <br /><br />The film begins with Annie (Kristen Wiig), a failed baker who is
drifting aimlessly through her life. She&#x27;s continuously late with her
rent; she habitually hooks up with a man who treats her like an
appliance, and (to make matters even worse) her best friend is about to
get married. Bride-to-be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) enlists Annie as her
maid of honor. The inevitable hi-jinks ensue as we meet the rest of the
bridesmaids: repressed Rita, innocent Becca, perfectionist Helen, and
the sturdy Megan. Take this rag-tag group, a churrascaria, and a posh
bridal salon, and you&#x27;ll get one of the most revolting, hysterical
scenes in any comedy. <br /><br />At its base, Bridesmaids is a comedy of embarrassment, rooted in the
steady decline of Annie as she descends into jealousy. The script
(written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) is incredibly knowledgeable about
the dynamics of female relationships, culling out every possible
chuckle and guffaw. The film is Kristen Wiig&#x27;s bed for comedy stardom,
and she succeeds without reservation, effortlessly toggling between the
comedic and dramatic notes. Yet to say the film belongs solely to Wiig
does the rest of the cast and crew a major disservice. The ensemble is
flawless, and the direction unobtrusive. Timing is everything in
comedy, and Bridesmaids ticks like a clock. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll be shocked if there&#x27;s a better mainstream comedy released this
year. Is Bridesmaids derivative of The Hangover? Yes. But on a
character to character level it surpasses that film, presenting
likable, three- dimensional characters played by outstanding actresses.
What makes Bridesmaids so refreshing is the fact that every one of its
gross-out gags is rooted in the truth of central friendship between the
main characters. High or low brow, that&#x27;s worth celebrating.
