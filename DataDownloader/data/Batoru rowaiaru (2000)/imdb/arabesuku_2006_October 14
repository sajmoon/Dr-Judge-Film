When I saw &#39;All About Lily Chou-Chou&#39; (aka &#39;Riri ShuShu No Subete&#39;, by
Shunji Iwai, 2001), I thought this was as messed up as teens could get
in these movies.<br /><br />However, after seeing &#39;Battle Royale&#39; (aka &#39;Batoru Rowaiaru&#39;), I
realised I was clearly wrong in my presumption.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil it for those who have not seen this movie yet,
but all I will say is that &#39;Battle Royale&#39; is dark, gory and sinister.
This movie has a constant love/hate, trust/mistrust relationship about
the teenagers and a dark ending around every corner.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely outstanding and the film itself stunning.<br /><br />A must-see, but definitely NOT for the faint at heart.
