Battle Royale (2000) takes a combined influence from The Most Dangerous
Game (1932) and Lord of the Flies (1963) and applies it to a socially
aware story that involves elements of horror, satire and science
fiction. Alongside these elements there are sardonic references to the
broader context of Japanese culture and the general knee-jerk attitudes
of Japanese society regarding the behaviour of their youth and the
importance for them to succeed in their education. In fact, you could
argue that there has been something of a general push in Japanese
cinema over the last ten years or so to depict this supposed slip in
attitudes and lack of overall traditional values presented by the youth
of the country, with their behaviour at school and their withdrawal
from more social activities in favour of surfing the net as being a
major factor in the supposed decline of Japanese society as many people
see it.<br /><br />Similar themes and concerns are also expressed in many J-Horror films,
such as The Ring (1998), Pulse (2001) and more recently One Missed Call
(2003), wherein the youth of Japan are swayed by the lure of technology
to the extent that they are ill-equipped to deal with the fears and
concerns of everyday living. The same themes are made explicit in a
film like Takashi Miike&#39;s Visitor Q (2001), which shares the satirical,
meta-textual approach presented by Battle Royale, but in a much more
subversive and controversial form. In fact, the moral message behind
Visitor Q and Miike&#39;s other great film The Happiness of the Katakuris
(2001) show that the problems facing contemporary Japanese society can
be corrected by restoring the basic foundation of the family unit and
the retrogressive ideas of the fraternal and maternal role-models and
the influence that they have on shaping the lives of their children.
Tellingly, the characters of Battle Royale have become disconnected
from their parents, cast adrift in a world that they&#39;re ill-equipped to
understand and as a result unable to cope with the pressures that their
adult society has put upon them.<br /><br />Here, the allusions to Lord of the Flies are developed with the idea of
children out of control, but contrasted further against the lurid, pulp
sensationalism of a film like The Running Man (1987); in which the
socio-political fears of the Japanese government are exploited by both
the commercial corporations and the media into producing scandalous
entertainment. It&#39;s a disturbing idea, one that gives the satire a much
needed dose of grit as the film occasionally veers off into teen soap
romance and the occasional clich&eacute;s of Japanese youth cinema. Despite
this though, the tone of the film is exceptional throughout; perfectly
juggling the more comical moments of satire, particularly those
involving the always brilliant Takeshi Kitano, with the disturbing
scenario and bursts of excessive violence. It is also worth noting that
the film is able to elicit empathy and understanding for this large
cast of characters, creating elements of back-story and personality
from the very brief scenes of narrative exposition, which is truly
astounding when you think of how easy these kids could have descended
into faceless victims or two-dimensional clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the performances from the young actors are strong,
covering the sheer horror presented by the film&#39;s central concept and
the various ways in which the different kids attempt to survive (some
refuse to fight, some band together, others attempt to smash the system
and a worrying few can&#39;t wait to cause bloody mayhem), and the
skilfully way in which the writers bring the usual teen preoccupations
with looks, popularity and the opposite sex as factors that eventually
lead to their downfall. Battle Royale is seriously good; not only as a
horror/thriller/satire with a teen-film subplot but as a piece of
genuinely superior and exciting film-making. At the time of writing, it
would seem that a Hollywood re-make is apparently in the works.
