The first thing I was thinking when watching this movie was that it was
pretty close to the 1963 Lord of the Flies. That is not necessarily a
bad thing...<br /><br />OK, the script is quite different, in regards that it is set in a
modern world and the reason for the combat (the main content of the
movie). Still, everyone who have seen Lord of the Flies, will recognize
how similar it is.<br /><br />I like this version, even though the storyline could be better. Most of
the acting is great, and even though these actors are young, they
really give a good performance. ...and that&#x27;s not easy, since this is a
quite violent movie. To act being hunted, being the next one to be
killed, to be the killer (as the only option), is refreshingly good.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the storyline could have been better, or, hasn&#x27;t been
used to it&#x27;s full potential (in my opinion). The start is OK, the
explanation of &#x22;the game&#x22; is very good, the game itself is weak at best
(many &#x22;stupid&#x22; turns), and the end a bit &#x22;typical&#x22;.<br /><br />The &#x22;gore&#x22; is great if you like that kind of stuff (like I do), and if
you like a merciless killing-medley.<br /><br />Wish more could have the guts and/or get the funding to create movies
like this. Movies that is pure violent, horrific and TRUE, in the sense
of how a human being would react in an environment like this. My
favorite horror movies manage to capture this feeling.<br /><br />7 of 10 is my rating. Good work!
