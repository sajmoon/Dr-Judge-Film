Battle Royale is based on the shockwave novel by Koushun Takami, which is
a
bestseller in Japan, and which has become very controversial in a very
short
time (and it is really easy to understand why). The plot is relatively
simple (a class of junior high school students are forced to kill each
other
on a desert island, the last survivor wins and can go back home), but it
is
this simplicity that makes its strength. No need for a very long prologue
before we enter the main act. Each of the 42 pupils involved in this
&quot;game&quot;
are not volunteers (no one would be..,), and of course they are forced to
kill their best friends /girlfriends in order to survive this horror. The
personalities and characteristics of each of the participants are of
course
very contrasted and even if there are some cliches, well, the worst has
been avoided. There are even quite &quot;realistic&quot; (even if it is very
difficult
to judge what can be realistic with such a plot) moments. The
transcription
of the inner thoughts of the characters, which is one of the strengths of
the
book, is averagely well retranscripted. Takeshi Kitano plays a &quot;teacher&quot;
(whose name is ...Kitano), leading the operation of surveilliance of this
&quot;game&quot;. It is very difficult to give an objective comment on this movie.
Violent. Ultra-Violent. And bloody. This is for sure. The book has to be
read for a more complete description of the hesitations and fears, but the
movie restranscripts very well the book is the sense that it is all
&quot;absurd&quot;. There is no real meaning to this violence. The students know
this,
but it can not be avoided.  It is quite sad that the movie dropped an
essential background element of the book (the story in the book takes
place
in an imaginery Japan which would have not lost WWII, and the movie takes
place in a slightly modified modern Japan), but I guess that making this
happen in the &quot;real-world&quot; shows that there is no need to go to an
imaginary
world to see to what extreme behaviors humans are capable
of.<br /><br />Highly disturbing. Rated R-15 (forbidden to under 15), very, very violent,
but nonetheless interesting.
