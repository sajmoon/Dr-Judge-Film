I couldn't believe my eyes. Out of all of the horror/survival films I
have ever seen, this is definitely on top of the list. I don't just
mean that in terms of foreign films, I mean in terms of film. I was
immersed into this crazy scenario that may seem absolutely ridiculous
at first, but once you look at it, it almost turns into a not so
outlandish thought.<br /><br />The story is laid out like this: Japan has is going down the proverbial
crapper. Unemployment is at an all time high and kids everywhere are
boycotting school. The country is in chaos. The government decides to
pass a law that is basically aimed at scaring the country into order.
The Law is called the BR Act. Heres the crazy part. A class is selected
by impartial lottery (and the grades seem totally random, as indicated
by the shot of the 1st or 2nd grader in the opening sequence) and sent
to an undisclosed, evacuated location. The classmates then have 3 days
to kill each other off until there is only one student left. This year,
it is a class of 9th graders (keep in mind that Japanese kids go to
school year round. in our school years, these kids would be seniors).
They are sent to an island, given weapons, and fight to survive.<br /><br />The cast in this film is chock full of Japanese Stars. Kitano Takeshi
(Kitano) plays the teacher that basically plays the ringleader. If you
have watched spike TV, you have seen him before. This is the actor that
plays as &quot;Vic Ramono&quot; on MXC. The rest of the cast is comprised of
Japanese teen pop idols. Most notably, the gorgeous Chiaki Kuriyama
(Chigusa). You probably know her too. She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill
Vol 1. Ando Masanobu (Kiriyama) plays the most menacing villain I have
ever seen.<br /><br />Asside from the classic Japanese blood sprays and the amount of ammo
some of the guns put out, there is great attention to detail in this
film. From what I have read, since the author (Kinji Fukasaku) of the
original book directed the film, everything is kept true to the book as
close as possible. Every time a student dies, their names appear on the
screen in the order they died. Inside the main building, there is huge
system of screens that show who is dead and what not. Anyway, that
screen is exact on the names as well as the 'danger zone' map. I had to
look twice to realize that. That is damn good editing right there.<br /><br />The characters in the film, though Japanese, can be related right back
to the kids you knew in high school. I joke around with my friends all
of the time saying, &quot;Oh thats so and so&quot; and, &quot;oh man, that is
definitely so and so.&quot; This brings so much depth into the film. It is
simply amazing to watch how everything plays out. This is like
Darwinism in the 21st century. I watch this film just saying, &quot;this is
what would happen.&quot; That is what the entire film is based on, the crazy
idea of 'this could happen.' The whole tag line of the movie is, &quot;could
you kill your best friend?&quot; The question is so spooky, I don't even
know if I could answer it. It taps into something so deep that you
really have to think about it.<br /><br />This film does have some comical moments. It is just too damn funny to
watch Takeshi Kitano sit on a couch and eat cookies while at the same
time watching his former pupils kill each other. There is just
everything in this movie. There are those love stories that you saw all
too often in school as well as those feuds between certain cliques and
egos.<br /><br />If you want a superb psychological thriller, this is the movie. This
film sent shock waves across Japan when it burst onto the scene.
Intelligent writing, great acting, beautiful locations, and decent
effects bring this film together. Its Lord of the Flies with High
School Kids. Its just great.<br /><br />10 out of 10
