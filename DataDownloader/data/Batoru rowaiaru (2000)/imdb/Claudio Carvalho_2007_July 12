In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the economy of Japan
is near a total collapse, with high rates of unemployment and students
boycotting their classes. The government approves the Battle Royale
Act, where one class is randomly selected and the students are sent to
an island wearing necklaces with few supplies and one weapon. After
three days, they have to kill each other and the survivor wins his or
her own life as a prize. The forty-two students of a ninth grade class
are selected to participate in the survival game and abducted in their
bus. Under the command of their former teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano),
they have to eliminate each other following the rules of the sadistic
game where only one wins.<br /><br />The screenplay of &quot;Batoru Rowaiaru&quot; is badly developed regarding the
explanation and advantages of such stupid act. It seems that the writer
and the director were only interested in the action of the movie, which
is great by the way, and forgot to justify how this survival game could
improve a shattered economy or the control of masses, more specifically
the students. The way this pointless story is disclosed, most of the
students seem to be normal youths, while the government and their
teacher seem to be the sadistic villain. My vote is six.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &quot;Batalha Real&quot; (&quot;Royal Battle&quot;)
