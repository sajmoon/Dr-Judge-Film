An interesting movie which closely resembles 'Lord of the Flies'.<br /><br />A brief summary: Unruly teens are placed on an island to battle it out,
the survivor walks away a ... well... survivor. This is part of a
government program to decrease the criminal rate as well as setting
examples for the unruly teens.<br /><br />The acting is typical teenager type. But not as exaggerated as most
western movies. It has a more 'off-camera' sense rather than
'in-the-spotlight' acting. The story is very interesting and it keeps
you wanting more just to see who the new victims are in this game. You
also get to see some (not much) character development with the
protagonists since their inception into the Battle Royale program.<br /><br />The death scenes are mediocre, not all that creative, yet maybe it is
their boringness that keeps you watching. The unconventional scythe to
the oh-so-common crossbow are some of the weapons employed.<br /><br />A decent movie, -2 points because it doesn't leave you wanting more by
the end. And -1 point because it is easily forgettable and doesn't have
anything truly breathtaking or unique.
