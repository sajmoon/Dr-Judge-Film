Presumably intended as a satire on the youth of Japan&#39;s disrespectful
attitude towards their elders, this doesn&#39;t really make much headway in
that direction but is fully functional as downbeat, disturbing horror:
a class of troubled teens are armed and placed on a deserted island and
told to kill each other off until only one remains. Sort of &#39;Lord of
the Flies&#39; meets any futuristic death sport movie, then, but there&#39;s
more to it than that. The movie gets better the more it goes on, the
more the rivalries and relationships are explored, the more the focus
tightens as the numbers are whittled down. The violence is senseless,
and cruel, and dirty; you&#39;ve got to feel sorry for both the kids who
can kill to survive and those who can&#39;t, and the acting is convincing
all round. Music is well used, and I think this might be the first time
since &#39;2001&#39; that a classical music score hasn&#39;t seemed like a
pretentious knock-off. This is hard stuff to watch at times, but it&#39;s
very effective.
