Well, having read the book and being disappointed in the past by book
to movie viewings, I was not too optimistic about this one. However,
given the fact that most of the actors/actresses are in their teens,
the acting was spot on. The film itself is brutal with regards to the
violence and quite shocking in spots. I can&#39;t tell too much as it would
give away some of the storyline and I was glad that they pretty much
followed the book as best they could. This is not just an updated
version of Lord of the Flies but more of a commentary on what can
happen when parents quit doing their job and allow the government to
control the children. However, this movie is definitely not for the
faint of heart.
