So I&#39;ve heard of this film for years now and the story most defiantly
intrigued me tho I had never read the book nor did i read the manga
version although I was and even mores so now eager to read them both. <br /><br />The 2 main reasons why I watched this film is the story plot and the
fact that Chiaki Kuriyama was staring in it being a big fan i had to
give this a look. I was blown away i knew from what i heard that this
film had a great story i never knew how powerful it could be. <br /><br />not only did give us a shocking and nerve pounding story with very
interesting circumstances, but it also gave us some brilliant
characters that are actually pushed to their limits in this film. the
score in this film i felt personally was OK nothing special but it
still gave the film that constant unnerving edge and was appropriate in
heart breaking moments. <br /><br />I do feel the first part of the film could of been longer so we could
get to know the characters better before they are transported onto the
island. but overall i feel this was a brilliant film with tons of
gruesome thrilling moments.
