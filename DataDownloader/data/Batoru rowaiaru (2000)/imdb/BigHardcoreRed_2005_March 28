Battle Royale, or Batoru Rowaiaru as named in Japan, was a pretty cool
Japanese action flick. Most of the special effects were pretty awesome
looking, but a few could be considered a bit cheesy, such as the over
splattering of blood. Believe it or not, the movie actually had it's
funny moments as well. The instructional video from the overly perky
girl telling the rules of the death game was a pretty funny bit.
Usually the humor from Japanese movies can escape me, but I liked the
humor here quite a bit, at least until the action and killing started.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is that, due to escalating violence in
schools, a law is passed which allows the military, or some kind of
militia, to take one troubled class and turn them all loose on an
island with the object of killing each other until one is standing.
They have 3 days to complete their objective or they all die.<br /><br />As the game begins, every 6 hours there is an update on which
classmates were killed and how many were left. These updates also alert
the students to danger zones, which are just places you do not want to
be when the time comes. The students are all issued a survival pack and
a random weapon as well. Some weapons are horrible and useless and some
would be great to have in a situation of this kind.<br /><br />The main characters are Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) &amp; Noriko
Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) who are close friends and refuse to kill each
other. The game is also somewhat rigged with the addition of two
&quot;ringers&quot;. One of whom plays for fun, another who has another reason.
Basically, one good and one evil. The good one is named Shougo Kawada
(Taro Yamamoto) and helps the students who he does not find a threat.
Also, Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill) puts in an amazing
performance. I can see why Quentin Tarantino chose her for his movie
based on this part here.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this movie - violence, action, humor and all
with very few complaints or annoyances. I can recommend this movie with
a clear conscience. 8.5/10
