The movie &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a lovely representation of the book by the
same name. True to almost the entire book (a rarity these days), this
movie captured me fast and kept me entertained. A great movie, though
in Japanese (yes, you will need to read subtitles.), Battle Royale is
amazingly done and realistic (in my opinion). I could see it happening,
someday, somewhere. As the title suggests, there will be blood. My
advice: If you don't like blood, don't watch it. However, in the event
that you DO like blood, Watch With Glee! You'll love this movie. There
is enough blood for the term &quot;bloody movie&quot; without the blood being...
too much, as it can be in some movies. In comparison to other foreign
films I've seen, I like this one the best. It has a simple-to-follow
plot without just pouring information into your skull all at once. It's
perfect in every way. I just hope the people in Hollywood don't get
their hands on it, because they'd kill it, like they did with Ringu,
Ring 2, and Ju-On.
