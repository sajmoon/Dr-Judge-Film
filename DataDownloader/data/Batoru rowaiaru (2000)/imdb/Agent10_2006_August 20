Battle Royale may seem like some serial killers favorite dream, the
plausibility of such an event is not too far-fetched. While the film
took a rather extreme stance on what to do with nagging problems of
discipline and apathy, the very idea of using violence to solve these
problems seems rather realistic.<br /><br />It&#39;s amazing the book this film was based off of wasn&#39;t made by an
American. Frankly, I&#39;m ashamed as an American that we couldn&#39;t come up
with something so feral and nihilistic. Are all of the daily dosages of
violence and havoc not helping us? Have we lost our edge? Well, on a
more serious note, BR was certainly something that opened my eyes.
While the budget could have been better in order to add some more
realism to the violence, the underlying message leads one to wonder
just how far off these assumptions are. While we tend to believe that
mankind could never do this to anyone, one needs to look no further
than the wars, genocide and evil we partake in every day.<br /><br />But what really makes Battle Royale a disturbing film is the rather
candid nature of the characters. While the shell shocked people were
quite realistic, it didn&#39;t seem too implausible that adrenaline junkies
like Kiriyama would enter in these contests just to experience the
thrill of killing someone. Either way, I regard this as a piece of
fiction, but like all texts that deal with the decay of society, this
feels vaguely familiar.
