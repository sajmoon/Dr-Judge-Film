the moment i found out about the book (at church camp), i was hooked.
the book was so awesome to read and i told all my friends. i let like 5
people borrow it, then some of my friends bought their own copy. some
even let the teachers read it! thats how interesting it is. the book is
golden, a true classic in Japanese and English. my copy has worn out,
but thats cause its been read so many times. when i heard there was the
movie, i flipped out. an awesome book, but would the film match up to
it? although everything wasn&#39;t covered, the movie is a true
masterpiece. you get most of everything big that happened. most of the
killings, but not everyone. i got a copy off of netflix. a true winner.
this movie is a classic in my library and in my top five of all time.
the sequel, however, let me down a little bit. it was basically a
Japanese war movie. but it was battle royale nonetheless, and i was
definitely pleased. now if koushin would write another BR book.
