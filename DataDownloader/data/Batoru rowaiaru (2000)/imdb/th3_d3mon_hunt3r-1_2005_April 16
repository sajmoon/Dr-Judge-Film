I'm not sure why I like this movie so much, it's sometimes depressing
and dark at times but at the same time, there's humour from Takeshi's
role and great violence from Chiaki Kuriyama aka Go-Go Yubari from Kill
Bill and not a dis-similar personality either. The plot is different
from a lot of other movies and it's interesting to see how the
'players' will deal with their classmates - kill or be killed? It's
still a great movie and much better than the (in my opinion) poor
sequel which bares little resemblance to this one. So grab this and
some of your friends and watch this some night because we all know that
Hollywood is eyeing this up for a remake some time...and I can't see it
being anything as good as this.
