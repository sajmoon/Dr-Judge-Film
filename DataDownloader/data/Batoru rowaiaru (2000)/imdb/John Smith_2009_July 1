I never saw more cruel or controversial plot in a Japanese movie as i
saw in &#x27;Batoru rowaiaru&#x27; aka &#x27;Battle Royale&#x27;. The whole idea of making
futuristic (although i didn&#x27;t see much of future in environment, only
the intro says it&#x27;s future...so it must be future!) action flick where
a class of 40+ students is given ultimatum to kill each others in
period of 3 days because there can be only one survivor, and all of
that happens on a deserted isolated island! Movie starts as brutally as
it gets, and from that point it gets more emotional through numerous
flashbacks (some of them were unnecessary) and dialogs, because it&#x27;s
not 40 strangers on island offing each other, it&#x27;s 40 classmates,
colleagues from school, many of them are friends with each other or
even something more and they are killing each other, that&#x27;s the
intriguing part of this whole film. Action scenes are very well
executed for a Japanese movie, although quite several times i felt they
are just overcooked and unrealistic (which was sometimes a good thing,
because i don&#x27;t wanna feel like i&#x27;m watching &#x27;Rambo&#x27; or some veteran
war movie where everything has to be realistic and to the point).
Acting was pretty good, hilarious in some scenes though (those Japanese
girls sure know how to scream and yell at each other very effectively),
casting contains no familiar faces as expected. One more thing i&#x27;d have
to take against this movie is its very ending which was in my opinion
as overcooked as those burgers that are so overcooked u can shatter
them just by throwing them on floor. I don&#x27;t think will be making a
remake of this movie anytime soon, because it&#x27;s very controversial and
basically against everything they stand for, and it&#x27;s also not a 100%
hit blockbuster so Hollywood producers sure as hell ain&#x27;t gonna rush
buying off rights for remake too.<br /><br />Japanese movie makers have shown great talent for making horror movies,
and with &#x27;Battle Royale&#x27; they have shown us that they can make
something realistically (if you can take this for being realistic at
all, considering this world were living in today...i could) intriguing
and unique, and not just fictional and eerie horror movie. Everyone
should see this film, action fans will like it for plenty of shooting,
girls will love it for strong emotional connections between lead two
characters as well as others, and all those who just like good movie
regardless of its genre, language or cast, will enjoy it like i did.<br /><br />8/10
