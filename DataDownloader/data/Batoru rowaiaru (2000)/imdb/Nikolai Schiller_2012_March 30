One of the greatest things about Asian cinema is that they are not
afraid to go all the way. This is a film, unlike most American mimics,
that you can actually see the brutal kills. &#x22;The Hunger Games&#x22; was a
movie that chickened out in detailing the brutality that their
characters were actually going through. Thus sucking all the tension
away. This film, on the other hand, got straight to the point and
developed its characters while the game was in action. &#x22;The Hunger
Games&#x22; attempted to do this with its flashbacks, but failed, as the
information it gave us felt rather irrelevant to anything that was
happening during the battle. In this film, however, it shows us why
certain characters act the way they do, and why certain characters are
willing to kill certain people. We get an insight on the relationships;
a girl who doesn&#x27;t like another girl for disliking her clique will
probably get killed. A girl who knows his boyfriend cheated on her with
another girl will probably kill the boyfriend and the mistress. Plus,
there was a larger sense of urgency with this film since they had
collars on their necks. I do, however, wish they had gone a little more
into the terrible consequences of the danger zones, which kept
switching, but you can&#x27;t have everything. Another thing that the film
did really well, with such fine sedulity is the basketball game. These
flashes to the game were necessary to entitle that all these kids who
are killing each other are all friends. The film had many great set
pieces, most of which involved the question, &#x27;can you even trust your
best friend?&#x27; Would you? I wouldn&#x27;t. This film has a rather cryptic
ending, but a simple message. Based on the novel, which turned manga,
this film does feel a little amateur at the beginning, but once it
kicks into gear, it is great. The violence by the way is very fun, but
not as gory as I suspected. 10/10
