This is considered the apex of Japanese &quot;shock&quot; cinema, but this
benefits from being based on a novel, and directed by an experienced
and talented director Kinji Fukasaku. Fukasaku was old and near death
when he decided to direct this, what inspired the decision was that
Kinji was in a boarding school during the breakout of World War 2, and
said he related to the book because he remembered, being abandoned by
the adult staff, hiding in ruins beneath the corpses of other children.
I&#39;m adding this because a story which seems so fantastic to a lot of
people, can be poignant and real to those with different experiences.
That being said...holy s*&amp;t! Holy s*&amp;t was my first thought as I
watched this movie, it was Lord Of The Flies, with arbitrary weapons
and explosive collars. Between all the action is an immensely dark
sense of humor (look out of the Godardesque in-titles), expressed
through the children&#39;s immaturity and inability to comprehend the
seriousness of their situation. Between the bullets there still 14 year
olds, interested in crushes and clicks, which adds helpful drama and
comedy to the constant mayhem.<br /><br />The shock of the premise gives way pretty early on to one well
developed scene after the next, as the body count rises. Takeshi
Kitano, plays the teacher master-minding the project, and plays one of
the best casual villains to ever grace a screen.<br /><br />Not a movie for everyone, talks of the American remake were put on hold
after the Virginia Tech shootings, and it&#39;s unlikely the mainstream of
the states would accept a movie like this anyway. Highly competitive
schools and high suicide rate, make movies like this and &quot;Suicide Club&quot;
major hits in Japan and over seas, where the context makes more sense I
guess. Anyway, believe the hype, if you get a chance see it.
