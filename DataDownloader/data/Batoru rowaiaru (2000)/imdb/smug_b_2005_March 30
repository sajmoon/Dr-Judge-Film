If you have not already seen this movie, then do so. This is THE
greatest movie ever made! I cannot go into detail, as I do not want to
give anything away. But, I will say that it is a sort of cross between
Lord of the Flies and 1984. It gripped me from the start, and
subsequently I have lost count of the amount of times I have watched
it. Fukasaku kinji was one of the best film-makers to grace the planet
with his presence. He is only surpassed by Miike Takashi (Visitor Q et
al.). Overall the acting was good. Especially from Beat Takeshi (The
Teacher Kitano), as always, though my favourites were Shibasaki Kou
(Souma Mitsuko), Hyuga Hitomi (Sakaki Yuko) and Kamiya Sayaka (Noda
Satomi), though the latter two did not really have that much
screen-time. There is a little bit of over acting in the Lighthoue
scene. But, this does not make the feature any less enjoyable. Indeed,
the Lighthouse scene is the best scene in the movie. Get this film
today!
