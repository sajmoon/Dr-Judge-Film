I don&#39;t think I had ever been affected by a film as much as I was the
first time I saw this one. It can be seen as a film full of senseless
violence, or it can be seen as a statement on the resolve of humankind,
and the reactions of humans when placed in an inescapable, nightmarish
situation. Could you kill your best friend? Some of the kids in this
movie can&#39;t act, and that&#39;s quite obvious, even for someone watching it
in subtitles. The players who CAN act, however, really CAN act.<br /><br />As usual, Takeshi Kitano plays a very understated character, but with
three dimensions. He is superb as the teacher who introduces the class
to Battle Royale.<br /><br />Some scenes in this film are ridiculous, to such an extent that you
might laugh out loud, when you shouldn&#39;t. Some might call this a black
comedy. I think it&#39;s a terrific horror story, essentially, as well as a
critique on human nature.<br /><br />This is a terrific film, and a personal favourite of mine. The only
person I know who doesn&#39;t like this film is my father, who thought it
was just violence for the sake of violence. He likes Steel Magnolias,
though, so his opinion is certainly questionable, to say the least.<br /><br />A word of warning: If you&#39;re going to get this movie, get the original
cut, and not the Special Edition. The SE of Battle Royale is spoilt by
a number of factors. For one, there was no need to add new scenes, like
the basketball match. I felt these extras additions detracted from the
overall dark feel of the piece, and I consider them to be completely
unnecessary. They also make the film drag slightly. As well as this,
there is the fact that the grey/dark blue filter used in the original
cut of the film has been removed in the Special Edition, making the
whole film appear more like a made-for-TV movie rather than a cinematic
masterpiece.
