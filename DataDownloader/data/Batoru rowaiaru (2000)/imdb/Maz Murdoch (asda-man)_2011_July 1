&#x22;Battle Royale&#x22; may seem on the surface to be just mindless killing of
older children, however the genius of Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s masterpiece is
the hidden message and impressive writing that lies their. In a similar
way to Kubrik&#x27;s &#x22;A Clockwork Orange&#x22; (as it&#x27;s often compared to) it is
a comment on a future society that&#x27;s deteriorating, with youth&#x27;s
disrupting the world. From here the society props us a survival
programme called &#x22;Battle Royale&#x22; in which students must kill themselves
until only one survives.<br /><br />&#x22;Battle Royale&#x22; is written to perfection. Why? Because one of the
greatest things about this film is the way it explores the lives of
students we don&#x27;t even know that well and makes us care about them!
This is the source to why the film is so utterly gripping (like the
book I suppose). We have three main characters, but throughout this
violent journey we&#x27;re introduced to people who we haven&#x27;t even seen
before in the film and are made to care about them. It&#x27;s pure genius
writing that goes along with the spectacular visuals.<br /><br />Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s directing is brilliant. He follows the same Japanese
formula for directing which mimics Tarantino&#x27;s directing in the
spectacular &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;. It really is very nice to look at right down
to the lighting and effects. It is pretty gory, but could&#x27;ve afforded
to be a little more bloodier but that doesn&#x27;t really matter. Kinji
Fukasaku takes us through the darkest side of human nature to thought
provoking effect! he even manages to splash jet black humour in there
which does actually work really well and sometimes to a metaphorical
effect.<br /><br />Another thing I really adore about this film is the melodramatic music.
It uses it in a similar way to Stanley&#x27;s masterpiece &#x22;A Clockwork
Orange&#x22; it&#x27;s over the top and works to near-perfection.<br /><br />In the end this is a stunningly original film with a heart-felt message
to give. All the aspects work to create a near perfect film with the
spectacular screenplay, impressive directing and stunning
cinematography. I sit here writing with a &#x22;Battle Royale&#x22; T-Shirt.
Yeah, it&#x27;s really that good.
