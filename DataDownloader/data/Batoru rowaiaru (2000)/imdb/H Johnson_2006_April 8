Okay, the first 30 minutes are pretty freakin&#39; sweet, I will admit, and
I made a mental note when I was watching them...&quot;the rest of this movie
will either get extremely awesome or extremely disappointing.&quot; Sadly,
the second one was true.<br /><br />Battle Royale was a brilliant concept, only so poorly written it hurt.
People who give this a good rating clearly don&#39;t care about good
cinema, but only cool action and violence. This had some extremely
intense, violent, but always predictable scenes in it, which was
extremely disappointing.<br /><br />My advice for you is to definitely watch this movie, because it does
have some extremely great moments, but also to not judge it on its
&quot;sweetness,&quot; but on it&#39;s merit as a movie. It is entertaining, but not
at all good.<br /><br />-H
