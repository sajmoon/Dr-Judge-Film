This is hands down one of the best Japanese movie ever made. It&#x27;s a
character driven movie that is done really well. Although the
characters is basically the whole students in a class room. Which
totals about 42 students. This movie does a real good job of building
those characters, even by slightly which is impressive considering this
movie is less than 2 hours long. This is also Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s
favorite movie from the 90&#x27;s and for good reason and isn&#x27;t really a
shock. Since it has just about all the elements that Tarantino gets
inspired from. I don&#x27;t think he is a bit of a overrated director by his
work but still...For him to rank this movie as number one shows how
good it is. The build up is really quick as well, since the students
get put in Battle Royale just 5 minutes in. If you want a more detailed
development I recommend the novel this movie is based on or even the
manga. This is simply a gripping and enthralling flick, that will get
you immersed from the beginning to end. If your one of those audience
that don&#x27;t like things that are grotesque or very violent, than this
won&#x27;t be the movie for you. To the rest if you miss this movie, you
will be missing out, especially for people that really enjoy films.
There just isn&#x27;t any boring moment in this movie, just about every part
is thrilling to the point it hardly gives a breather. So the premise is
about a class room full of students getting put on a island to kill
each other because of a game called Battle Royale and each one gets a
bag either filled with weapons or something useless. This is because
the students became too rebellious and the adults became afraid of
them, thus they allowed this horrendous program to go on. Sure this
premise has been done before but this is probably the first one to do
it in a manner that is super effective. It&#x27;s simply a survival/horror
film at it&#x27;s best and even has creepy psychological aspects to it as
well. Like how far would you go to survive? The script isn&#x27;t something
that is perfect but it&#x27;s still very effective and the acting is
believable as well, although slightly over the top. The special effects
is passable especially since this came out in the early 2000. I usually
don&#x27;t go by what critics say but this movie deserves the positive
feedback it&#x27;s been getting. I am not sure if this flick did well in
japan, I assume it did but it isn&#x27;t a shock that it&#x27;s become a cult
film although a lot of film lovers watched this. There will be a lot of
movies in the future that will have elements that came from this movie
because it will inspire either the directors or the writers. If you
enjoy watching movies or any cult films than do not pass on this one.
This one deserves a 9.3/10. This came out in the year 2000 but still
holds up today and even beats some movies of this genre in the present.
Just don&#x27;t bother watching the sequel even out of curiosity, unless you
really have to. But it&#x27;s going to ruin the experience with this one, it
just lacked just about everything that made this one great.<br /><br />9.3/10
