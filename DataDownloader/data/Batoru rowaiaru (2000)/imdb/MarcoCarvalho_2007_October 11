What is the point!!?? The premise of this movie is that in a not so far
away future Japan will have a serious unemployment issue and 800.000
students feeling that there is no future for them start to boycott
school and authorities are afraid of rebellion.<br /><br />Sounds good so far? Wait for it &#133; Teenage rebellion is a great topic,
we only have to look around us to see lost and broken children, apply
this to a crumbling society and there is potential havoc.<br /><br />Them what do the authorities decide to do? They will randomly choose a
class of 40 9th graders put them in an island somewhere and make the
fight it out until one remains. Yes, I said randomly, no matter if you
are a great student, perfect attendance you can still be drafted to
this island &#133; you have to wonder why these teens are so upset. Go
figure.<br /><br />Even if killing 40, random students out of 800.000, rewarding the most
violent and traitorous of them could have some deterrent affect on the
rest of the student population &#133; first they had to know about it and
every single student in that class seamed surprised to hear of this
BRact (bet you next time they&#39;ll read the fine print in their
registration form).<br /><br />Technically the film is not so bad, very good photography, competent
music and sound track, good editing to. There is a mix of actors
ranging from the very good to the &quot;thank God he died so I don&#39;t have to
see his acting again).<br /><br />Despite the actors effort the characters are poor, with 1 or to
exceptions we know nothing about them, what makes them run &#133; or fight &#133;
or just scream scared.<br /><br />In short if you are looking for a gore/slash movie and you have nothing
better to do go for it. But if you are looking to get an insightful
look at society and teenagers &#133; there is no point.
