First, do not see this movie if you are squeamish, it is filled with
ultra-violence (though not as bad as Ichi the Killer or Beat Takeshi&#39;s
remake of Zatoichi).<br /><br />The basic premise of the movie, is that as part of their compulsory
school graduation a group of students is taken to an island and told
that only one of them is allowed to survive.<br /><br />The concept, of course, seems ridiculous, even under the dystopian
future of Japan the movie takes place in. But, it&#39;s lunacy actually
helps to increase the movies value as a satire. Although there is
plenty of ultra-violence to titillate any viewer, it is not simply
shocking but also a method of Brechtian alienation.<br /><br />I saw this movie myself, right after graduating from high school, and
it really hit close to home. Although it is often compared to Lord of
the Flies, I didn&#39;t really see this. In Lord of the Flies, the children
created the problems of society on their own. This feels more like
Ender&#39;s Game where the adults try to fix the problems they themselves
have created; and instead pass them onto the children as a result. This
especially hits with &quot;the exchange students&quot; as it almost seems like
something the school boards would do to help teenagers learn. (I must
resist the urge to call them TA&#39;s.) Finally, the exercise of having &quot;a
most dangerous game&quot; at the end of compulsory education seems to be
very much like the way high school felt to me. The kids in the movie
have no experience or knowledge of how to fight that they don&#39;t bring
to the table on their own; much like how today&#39;s students are
constantly having to go through independent studies and group work
projects with no guidance; rather than a back to the basics teach and
then test; then reteach what was not learned approach. The real schools
will say that it helps prepare the student for college, but as I found
out myself, we&#39;d be better served in college by a better understanding
of the basics.<br /><br />So, if your looking for an action adventure story akin to a large scale
version of &quot;The Most Dangerous game&quot; you&#39;ll get that; if you&#39;re looking
for an intellectual satire on how high school has become a system for
weeding children out of society before they get to college instead of
teaching them, you&#39;ll get that too.<br /><br />And as one note on the film making itself rather than it&#39;s content
(which missing the point with this piece, but anyway), Beat Takeshi&#39;s
acting is the best I have seen him. He combines his manic facial
expressions and sudden mood swings from his comedy work with the raw
talent and believability of his dramatic work. His talent is sufficient
to make it seem like this could actually happen if he was your teacher.
