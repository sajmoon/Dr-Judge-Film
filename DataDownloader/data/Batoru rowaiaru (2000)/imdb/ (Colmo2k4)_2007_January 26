The principle problem with this film happened early in the film. When
the kidnapped kids demand an explanation of the disaffected former
teacher why they are there, he explains &quot;they passed a law...Battle
Royale!&quot; as if that could perfectly explain why a struggling government
would attempt to curb the excesses of their adolescents by pitting them
violently against one another in an elaborate game with no audience,
resulting in one remaining hardened and traumatised individual. How
this would actually improve society escapes me, aside from trimming the
numbers slightly; human history is littered with far more effective
examples of how to cull a population. Frankly, there are less flimsy
premises propping up the average adult movie.<br /><br />From then on, I spent more time cracking jokes about the absurd premise
than getting sucked in by the fear and tension of the participants,
which is sad, because it could have been different. As others have
mentioned, the film suffered for lacking an actual point to all the
violence - nobody actually gained from it.
