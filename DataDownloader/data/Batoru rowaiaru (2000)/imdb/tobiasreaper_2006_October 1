This has to be one of the most if not THE most original film i&#39;ve ever
seen...<br /><br />There&#39;s so much that it has on the plus side. There&#39;s bucket loads of
action, the directing and acting is phenomenal and the plot, Oh my god
the plot! Fantastic and strikingly original.<br /><br />Your given a plot, no no...a game where violence and mayhem will take
place, your even given a time limit.<br /><br />I myself enjoy tartan Asian movies and i think that there are some
fantastic foreign movies that don&#39;t get half enough attention, e.g.
Oldboy, Brotherhood (one of the best war movies ever!) and Hard Boiled.
This film is well up there with those fantastic titles and is on my top
list without a doubt I was extremely impressed and if you like action
and originality then sit back and enjoy!
