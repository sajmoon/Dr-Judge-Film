If you were put on an island and told you have to kill everyone in your
class within three days or you die what would you do? Well thats what
the kids int this film are told and its rather scary how suddenly some
of them can turn on their friends but when it comes to survival i
suppose we would all kill..wouldn&#39;t we? This is a foreign masterpiece
that has no equal. Not only is the story absolutely out of control and
completely crazy it is also really compelling and mind boggling. I can
guarantee you will be thinking about your own lives and friends and
wondering what you&#39;d would do if you had to kill one of them to save
yourself after watching this film.<br /><br />But don&#39;t get me wrong i think this film is absolutely brilliant and
deserves all of the credit it deserves, anyone not sure whether they
want to sit through two hours of sub titles then take my advice and do.
Cause after ten minutes you forget your watching a Japanese film and
you decide you don&#39;t care anyway.<br /><br />Watch it now!!!! Oh but avoid the second one cause its not quite as
good.
