For anyone who has read the book, you will certainly enjoy this movie.
If you have not read the book, then you may enjoy it anyway, but you
run the risk being confused, and will not understand all that is going
on. <br /><br />This movie has been hailed as showing too much over-the-top and graphic
violence, but anyone who has read the book could tell you that the
movie is a walk in the park compared to the book&#39;s description of the
killings.<br /><br />What many people who will only watch the movie will take away from it
is a feeling of watching Lord of the Flies in Japanese. Personally, I
felt a connection to the main characters after reading the book. This
connection was only amplified after watching the movie. <br /><br />If you can get your hands on a copy of the movie- watch it. If you can
find the book (not that hard)- read it. And if you read the book, then
you will certainly want to watch the movie.
