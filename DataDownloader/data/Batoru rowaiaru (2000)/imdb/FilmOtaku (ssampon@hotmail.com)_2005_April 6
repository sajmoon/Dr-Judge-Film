Kinji Fukasaku's film &quot;Batoru Rowaiaru&quot; (Battle Royale) is based on
Koushun Takami's novel and features a pretty frightening premise. It is
the new millennium and Japan is in a state of near-anarchy. Students in
particular are running wild; making their teachers' lives hell or
skipping students entirely. In response, the government enacts a new
law called the Battle Royale Act in which randomly chosen classes of
students are drugged and taken to an evacuated island. When they wake
up, they have electronic collars around their necks and are told by
their teacher that they must spend the next three days hunting and
killing one another. The last one standing survives and is able to
return home; if there is more than one student left, they will all die
when the collars around their necks explode. The students are all given
random bags with food, water and one &quot;weapon&quot; enclosed. The weapon can
be anything from a pot lid to a machine gun. In this particular &quot;game&quot;,
of the 42 classmates, the two students we see the most of are Noriko
(Maeda) and Shuya (Fujiwara), a girl and boy who have obvious feelings
for one another and don't want to kill anyone, they just want to figure
out a way to get off the island alive, and together. Alternatively, the
other students are all subscribing to Darwin's theory and doing what
they have to in order to survive and make it off the island alive; this
means forgetting friendships, even love affairs. Most are reluctant,
but there are a few who immediately adapt to the circumstances.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I was actually surprised the
film wasn't more shocking or violent. Obviously, seeing (mostly)
innocent teenagers being killed is shocking, and the deaths were
definitely violent (I'm not sure how an ax to the head couldn't be) but
I think I was expecting just a little bit &quot;more&quot; I think. That's not to
say that the film wasn't good; I thought that the premise was very
interesting, and it definitely is an interesting social commentary in
the same vein as William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The film also
had a satisfying ending, though it wasn't what I expected out of a
foreign, particularly Japanese film.<br /><br />&quot;Battle Royale&quot; is definitely violent, but it's not so over the top
that the average viewer is going to get turned off or sick over it (I
don't think). The story alone is interesting enough to look it up; I
just honestly think that I had the unfortunate occasion to hear some
preliminary reviews from people I know that said it was just intensely
violent and shocking, and when it wasn't, I was a little let down.
Truth be told, that is probably a good thing, and I'm the psycho for
being disappointed with a mere above average level of violence in film.
Either way, it would not be a bad idea to check this one out if you
come across it. 6/10 --Shelly
