&quot;Battle Royale&quot; is one of the most controversial and challenging movies
ever made.The film is very gory and violent,but it&#39;s also
witty,satirical and thought provoking.The concept of &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is
pretty simple.The act of Battle Royale decrees that once a year a class
of 9th graders is chosen at random,stranded on a small island,and armed
with random weapons.The kids are also outfitted with strange necklaces
that monitor their locations and life functions,and explode if more
than one student is alive at the end of 72 hours.The kids are forced to
become savage killers,and the movie provides them with interesting
personalities and human reactions to the horrible situation in which
they find themselves.The acting is brilliant and the violence is
horrific and merciless.The film is very exciting and
well-photographed.A masterpiece that needs to be seen by every fan of
wonderful Japanese cinema!
