There sure wouldn&#x27;t be any discipline problems in our schools if we had
a Battle Royale every year.<br /><br />About 60 students are selected and taken to a deserted island. Only one
can win.<br /><br />Several students make alliances, but they forget that the game ends in
three days, so alliances will not work unless they can figure out how
to beat the game.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is a bloody film with student killing each other
hourly.<br /><br />The ending certainly leave room for a sequel.
