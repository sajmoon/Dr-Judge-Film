I haven&#x27;t read the novel, but I certainly am considering it. This is
also the only thing by Fukasaku that I&#x27;ve watched, which I most
definitely intend to change. And finally, this will not be the last
Japanese film that I take in. This is immensely shocking, tragic,
funny, sad, frenetic and enjoyable. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many times
this yanked the carpet out from under me, and yet, as paradoxical as it
may sound, I had no trouble following it. Somehow this manages to not
overstimulate the viewer to the point where it becomes unpleasant, and
yet create an atmosphere of constant threat and danger, and compelling
drama. It seems utterly *unreal* how well this builds and maintains
tension. The characters are all credible and the psychology is all
spot-on; the only negative I can truly say about this, and it is a
minor complaint, is that I could honestly not keep track of everyone,
and tell them all apart from one another. This has perfect pacing, it
is amazing how much energy there is in it, and yet it doesn&#x27;t lose the
audience at any point. The action is outstanding and exciting. This is
engaging, absurd, beautiful, with moments of creepiness... I could go
on. The music is impeccable, the score and classical pieces alike.
There is a lot of bloody, at times gory and/or brutal, violence and
disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 34 minutes long behind
the scenes featurette and two trailers, however, for some reason, on
the Scandinavian released disc, none of those three(unlike the movie
itself), are subtitled. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it.
10/10
