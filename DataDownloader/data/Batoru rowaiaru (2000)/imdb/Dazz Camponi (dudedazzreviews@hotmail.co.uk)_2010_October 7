Cult classic thriller Battle Royale is based on a book by Koushun
Takami of the same name and both the book and the movie has caused
controversy. It&#x27;s well-known for it&#x27;s gory violence and on lists and
surveys, remains to be one of the top 20 horror-thriller movies of the
decade. So is Battle Royale really this good? The answer to that
question is yes, it really is. The story is simple yet brilliant and it
keeps you hooked for the duration of the movie. The characters were
brilliantly written and the actors who starred in the movie did an
amazing job playing their parts. Tatsuya Fujiwara did a brilliant job
playing as Shuya and Aki Maeda was great as Noriko, the rest of the
cast gave out a solid performance as well. The direction and the
writing were all brilliant and the script was done very well. A movie
like this was bound to cause controversy but the movie was brilliantly
done. The cast and crew should be proud of this! I saw the movie before
reading the book and again after and the book is better than the movie,
which was to be expected. However, the movie does capture what it is
supposed to capture. The acting was brilliant as they captured the
emotions of their characters perfectly and you could feel their
emotions: Fright, panic, stress, love, hate, delight, etc, and that&#x27;s
what I love in a movie because it makes you feel connected. The
violence and blood shed in the movie is very high and yet it didn&#x27;t
really feel unnecessary for the movie. The book was violent so I
expected as much from the movie. The book makes you feel more attached
to the characters than the movie does but you still feel attached to
them in the movie as well. Overall, I would seriously recommend this to
anybody who loves a good thriller and don&#x27;t mind subtitles or violence
but if you do mind subtitles and you don&#x27;t like gory violence, give
this a miss. I really recommend you watch this subbed though, dubbed
usually isn&#x27;t very good in a foreign movie.<br /><br />To read more reviews, please visit:
