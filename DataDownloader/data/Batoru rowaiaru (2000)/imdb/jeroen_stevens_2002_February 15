'Mulholland Drive' being too long a film for me to be able to catch my
train
home, I had to choose between a children's film, some films I'd already
seen, 'Battle Royale' or no film at all... The description showed good
potential, reminding me of works like 'Das Experiment' and 'Lord of the
flies'.<br /><br />Sadly, the film turned out to be utterly disappointing: the violence is
there just to shock as many people, the 'scenario' is almost non-existent
and shows some impossibilities (the IMDB guidelines advise me not to say
which, but it won't be hard to find out yourself) and the acting is totally
over the top - Takeshi Kitano being one of the very few exceptions.<br /><br />For me, most of the time, giving opinions on the IMDB stops at rating the
film. But after having read so many cheerful reviews and a score of (on the
15th of February) 8.1/10, I felt it was my duty as a decent citizen to
inform you of the emptiness of this total crapmovie. However, if you want
to
see more than 30 ways of killing an opponent, this one is highly
advised!<br /><br />2/10.
