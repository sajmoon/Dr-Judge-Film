it was a very fun movie to watch, though it was just a little
ridiculous through out the killing, and was very gossipy, there was
only really one thing to say. amazing film. hunger games is never going
to be this good. this is the real thing and the movie was just
wonderful. best part of it all must have been the ending. but just to
say if you really aren&#x27;t the type to watch gossipy movies (not that
this really was among the killing) i would think a bit before watching
this.this movie will really churn your feeling but hey, it is made for
that. more than anything its not one of those movies that are ruthless
and made for just the sheer joy of kill and gore (also the movie does
not have much gore). its made for sheer fun and love of the movie.
Overall...<br /><br />AMAZING.
