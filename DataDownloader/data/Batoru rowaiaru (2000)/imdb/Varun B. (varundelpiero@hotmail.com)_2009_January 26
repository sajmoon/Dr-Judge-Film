Many have been quick to dismiss BATORU ROWAIARU as a tasteless
gore-fest with little or no class or intelligence to speak of. The fact
that the violence involves mostly teens adds to the
sensitive/controversial nature of the film. Those who understand the
position of Japanese society at the turn of the century will understand
the deep-lying social implications of this film, and will revel in its
ultimate brilliance. At the turn of the century, many Japanese adults
were fast becoming afraid of the youth, who were becoming more and more
uncontrollable and rebellious. This Motion Picture is a fantastic
extension of the concept of Japanese teen violence.<br /><br />The movie is an altogether superb one, and is not as tasteless as many
make it out to be. There is a reason why film great Quentin Tarantino
lists this as one of his favourite films of all time.<br /><br />The acting, especially by relative newcomers Aki Maeda and Tatsuya
Fuliwara is quite excellent, as is the story, direction by Kinji
Fukasaku, and the overall atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />Thankfully, I saw the subtitled version, and not the dubbed one (if
there is such a thing). Overall, a quite visceral and cerebral feast.
8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at 145. Highly
recommended.
