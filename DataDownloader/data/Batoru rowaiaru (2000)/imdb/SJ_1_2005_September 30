Battle Royale's premise is very interesting and already gives it a good
head-start. Imagine if a class of teenagers from a school was sent to
an island, where only the last one left alive survives. It's
far-fetched and ridiculous, certainly the idea that a &quot;transfer
student&quot; would willingly enter themselves into the game for fun is
stretching it a bit, but it's something everyone can relate to. A new
spin on the countless reality TV game-shows and also, everyone's been
in school, so you could imagine your school class in this position and
how strange a situation it would be.<br /><br />However, the premise also brings problems along with it, with a class
of 42, as is shown in the film, how do you present it? There's always
the danger of it becoming just a couple of hours of continuous killing
and violence, and how do you flesh out the characters? With a premise
as disturbing as this one, any of the students being killed is
shocking, but how do you decide which characters to develop and which
ones to kill off straight away. Certainly the filmmakers would have had
a difficult job with this concept and trying to make it into a decent
film.<br /><br />There are, as you would expect, characters that die who we really don't
know anything about except their name, but by the end all the key
characters have been developed and we can now recognise them. The
aforementioned &quot;transfer student&quot; is a sadistic teenage killer who we
always expect to be lurking in the background, and we're cheering on
anyone who's anyone to just finish him off.<br /><br />There are twists and turns along the way and it's suspenseful all the
way through. Who can our main characters trust? Can anyone really be
trusted? By the end however, it needs to come to a conclusion, and it's
here where I wasn't really satisfied. It's very difficult to come up
with an ending to this concept, if one is left alive as the game's
rules suggest, then it's an anti-climax, if a few of them escape, it's
an anti-climax. It needed something really new and original to finish
it all off, and let's just say I maybe expected more from the ending.<br /><br />Overall, the film is intriguing and worth a watch, but it fails to
deliver a really great conclusion which would have made it into a great
film.
