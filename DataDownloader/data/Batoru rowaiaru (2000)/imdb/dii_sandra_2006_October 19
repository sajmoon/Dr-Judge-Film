A boy from my class showed the movie as a presentation. I didn&#39;t know
what to expect. I think the movie was really good. It wouldn&#39;t be my
favorite choice but i wouldn&#39;t mind watching it.<br /><br />It&#39;s not really a movie for people who don&#39;t like killing and blood and
stuff but if you can handle that it&#39;s quite fun to watch. I think the
actors did well,because it probably won&#39;t be easy tot play such a role.
So to people who like watching movies with killing and blood. I
recommend this movie to them. I give it a big plus! A 10 of course. So
watch this movie because it&#39;s a really good one!! But watch it with
subtitles because you might not speak Japanese.
