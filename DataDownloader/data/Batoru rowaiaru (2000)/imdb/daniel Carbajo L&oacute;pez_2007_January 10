Some years in future, Japan lives a great breakdown: lots of people
without work, the students don&#39;t respect the adults, riots everywhere.
To solve the problem, government promotes the BR law: once a week a
random class will fight with each other until only one student lives.
This will not only be useful as a population control but also as a
natural selection, as only the strongest lives. The movie is about one
of the class that take part in the &quot;championship&quot;. Many people has
claimed that the movie has lots of nonsense violence and it makes funny
about people killing each other. Well, it is true that the movie is
violent, but not more than most Hollywood films (Bond, Seagal, etc), I
expected more blood indeed. In fact, most of the students seem totally
frightened about the situation and behaves in a very logical way: they
make alliances to survive, they protect each other and some commit
suicides as they don&#39;t want to play the game. Of course there are some
that become sadistic and kill everyone the see but this is not the
usual. In the deep side there&#39;s a reflexion about the society and the
relation between parents and children and their lack of communication,
but most people tend to ignore it at watching all the deaths of the
film. Actors are quite good and the behaviour of all the characters is
very well done. Every student reacts different and logical and the
dialogues are typical of a 16-year-old teenager and a bit silly,
though. One of the best things is the cast: it is not usual that the
actors have the age their characters have (we are used to see
24-year-old actor trying to be a boy of 18), this makes the film more
touching, due to the youth of the characters. In fact, a very good
movie, but not for all tastes due to its violence and plot. In the
extended version (1h more), most of the aspects and topics of the film
are perfectly told, but it results too long for most of people.
