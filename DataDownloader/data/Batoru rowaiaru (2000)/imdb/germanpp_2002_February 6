2002_February 6 

I am amazed by all the praising reviews I have read since I watched this
movie. I respect all opinions, but all got for my money were two hours of
cheesy, violent entertainment.<br /><br />I personally did not find it specially sick or shocking. It was simply too
bad to be unsettling.<br /><br />The plot does not make any sense in the first place. I do not have a deep
knowledge about Japanese culture, but a law like Battle Royale sounds
totally unrealistic. Someone please explain to me the positive effects it
would have. And virtually all other details are borrowed from previous
films; there is nothing original about the explosive necklaces, the fight
to
death until only one stands alive, the random distribution of different
weapons, and so on.<br /><br />Most of the characters were clich&eacute;, and many of their reactions were not
credible. Add to this the generally very poor performances, and you get a
very laughable lot. The hero smoking his cigarette thoughtfully while
drinking from his flask and the hot evil girl are especially
hilarious.<br /><br />The version I watched was dubbed into French, and I accept that the
dialogues are probably better in the original version. But I just cannot
believe that a good script can be translated into all those stupid lines.
Most the talk about love, fear, trust and desperation just made me
laugh.<br /><br />I hope that the classical music sound track, and tricks like the screen
turning to black to highlight some key lines of the characters were some
kind of joke, and not a lame attempt to give some real profound
atmosphere.
In that shabby context, I found myself associating the classical scores
with
TV commercials of toilet paper, tomato sauce and the like.<br /><br />I enjoy being unsettled and sickened by movies. Good films with lots of
physical or mental violence tend to leave me in a very good mood one or
two
hours after leaving the cinema, once the emotions wear out.<br /><br />As for bad violent movies, like Battle Royale, I guess I have seen enough
of
them (hasn't everyone?) to be able to sit through two hours of teenage
slaughter without being touched at all. Maybe it is that I do not find
high
school uniforms and Japanese young girls all that attractive. I was going
to simply forget about this movie,
when I heard all the hype about it, and felt compelled to write a bad
review.<br /><br />On the bright side, I personally like Kitano, and he made me laugh a
couple
of times in this movie.
