This film is film that I believed had to be made, and it was only a matter
of time before it was.  Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could
never
have conceived making.<br /><br />Firstly to get it out of the way I will say that I loved this movie,
although at no point did I feel comfortable while watching it.  It had the
power and emotional content, that while not necessarily apparent in the
dialogue was visible on screen at all times.<br /><br />I am truly glad that this film has come out of mainstream Japanese cinema.
It would have only been made in the US by independent film-makers who
would
have basked in the glory of its controversy and felt oh-so-smug that they
had created it, while shoving a moral in your face.  While I actually have
no problem with US Indie film I do feel that a Western background would
have
comprised on visceral content, and upped the content of cheap moral
points.<br /><br />For those who say the violence was &quot;cartoon-style&quot; and laughable must have
been watching a different film.  Whilst this film is heavy in black humour
I
can clearly say that the deaths are shocking in the extreme, and there is
no
relenting from the beginning to the end.  Only occasionally does the
camera
pan away from the final deed.  The only deaths that have a dark humour
content to them, are those involving Kitano (Beat Takeshi) and the &quot;lone&quot;
vigilante (those who have seen the film will know what I am talking
about).
Other sections, such as the &quot;Training Video&quot; are equally comedic, and
absurd.  Yet other deaths are shocking in the extreme, and show how the
slightest suspicion can have disastrous consequences for groups that only
have trust to keep them together, a truly shocking scene in the Lighthouse
reinforces this.<br /><br />The fact that this film employs Children as the main protagonists of the
story is the key to the whole impact of the film.  We have all seen films
like The Running Man where adults fight adults for survival and it seems
that much less shocking, albeit that film was handled in a completely
different manner.  Children have the innocence that makes the brutality of
this film that much more shocking, adults in the same situation would have
had the reaction from audiences of cheering at the screen as the hero
dispatches yet another victim.  This could never and would never have been
the case with this film.<br /><br />To another commentator who felt that this film sticks with you less than
Scream, I simply fail to find this to be anywhere close to the truth.  The
deaths in Scream although bloody are nothing but pastiche of those films
that Scream is mimicking, ultimately throwaway deaths that up in brutality
in order to out-do the last one that have one or two psychotic
perpetrators,
who eventually get their comeuppance.  In this film their are no victims
and
besides one exception there are no villains amongst the children.  They
simply HAVE to play the game or die.<br /><br />Well I encourage all those who feel they can stomach it to go and see this
film or find it available somewhere (as I believe it has been banned in
the
US).  It is not truly a film denouncing the evils of Reality TV or showing
us the future of that trend of Broadcasting, that is merely a plot device
to
place the children in this situation.  The nature of the film lies in its
deconstruction of Friendships, Trust and our views on Innocence.  Go and
see
it not as a spectator of this BR spectacle but as one of the participants
and remember what was important to you when you were at school, and
whether
any of those rivalries, hatreds and friendships would have been enough for
you to decide who deserves to die and who deserves to live.
