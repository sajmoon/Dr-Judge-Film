Easily the most jaw-droppingly awful movie I've seen in ages. I wish so
badly that this was released in theaters over here so it could get
pummeled by the critics. Akin to most Asian &quot;schockers&quot; and horror, its
all premise and absolutely nothing else. The first ten minutes is kind
of cool and does a decent job (or rather not) of setting up what
unfortunately turns into the most baffling mess of a movie I've
possibly ever seen.<br /><br />A bunch of annoying brats with 30 second characters (theres like 100 of
em) let loose and run around babbling about nothing while acting
scared. The writing is pathetic, the acting even worse, then a tally
goes up every couple of minutes in the corner of the screen signifying
somebody died. How brutal. How shocking. How stylish! Lets over-analyze
and get philosophical about it because its an allegory or wait, a
metaphor, um, its ironic, yeah thats it.<br /><br />Too bad not an iota of time is given to develop anything so you could
care less who's getting killed. I mean I couldn't even finish this
crap. Some annoying girls started screeching about some abandoned
outhouse or some crap they were trying to hide in and its like what the
hell are you girls even talking about. I just had a bail on it and try
again the next day. Beyond annoying. Of course this film could never be
made in North America, it would be laughed out of the multiplex by
everyone other than the local mallrats.<br /><br />A really bad movie thats been heralded as something otherworldly but is
about as smart, fun, important, and digestible as the turkey sandwich
I'm now eating. HIC!
