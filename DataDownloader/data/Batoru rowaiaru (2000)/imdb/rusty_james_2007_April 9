Many comments on here have gone into depth about the author&#39;s own
thoughts on the film &quot;Battle Royal&quot; from a Western, cultural point of
view. This goes to show that there is a message here that transcends
the cultural barrier. Truly, the film&#39;s imagery and interpersonal
conflicts can be related to on many levels and it speaks to people of
many nations. For the moment, please leave those comments behind and
try to understand what the film is saying towards the culture that it
comes from; that is to say, audience for which it is truly intended
for: The Japanese in order to add another dimension of understanding. <br /><br />More of less this film is about the Japanese Educational system. It&#39;s a
metaphor- an extreme, gory, shocking and sometimes humorous metaphor,
but a visage of a system in Japan nonetheless. Let me explain: First,
the Japanese school system is extremely competitive in the pre-high
school and high school years. There are tests that actually place you
in college and furthermore your &quot;rank&quot; in the education system. This
literally determines your place in society. Needless to say, the
competition for placement in a good school and the tests they give are
high-pressure. The angst that a child new teenager feels is strung
throughout this movie, silly &quot;I love you- you must help me&quot; themes, the
click theme, the young lovebird theme, the &quot;devil may-care&quot; theme, and
yes, the suicide theme. Each of these steps point to a part of the
Japanese school system and outlines the way children feel when they are
reaching puberty within the school system here, and truly it reflects
the broad range of extreme feelings they have. The pressure, the
hatred, the rivalry, the distrust- it&#39;s all there. Second, it shows how
the school system provides failure where there should be success and
success where there should be failure. The rampant, uncaring students
that ruin everything for a few good students, the way that sub
ordinance is more important than speaking your mind, and how the
ability to stab another in the back in order to survive is marked out
in no uncertain terms. All of these things are truly stemming from the
no-fail school system where uncaring students are moved along the
lines, pushed into factories in later life while screwing it up for
everyone else in the process. Third, the character that Kitano &quot;Beat&quot;
Takeshi plays is bitter-sweet, one that is borderline insane and
erratic, truly speaking for the teachers locked into the system that
will not change for its own good. The pressure and sadness that Kitano
portrays, along with extreme humor in announcements and act of violence
approved of by the system, creates a dark metaphor for a system that is
not only failing the students, but dashes the hopes and dreams of
teachers to bits. <br /><br />Hopefully when one looks at this film, they get the humor in it and see
it for what it really is: a social commentary not meant to offend, but
to entertain and shock one into thinking. <br /><br />This film is worth owning. It has a very potent message, but is
enjoyable enough to watch over and over. It truly has a large cult
following here in Japan and is a source of release for teens feeling
the angst of school.
