This movie was cheesy and exploitative, with ridiculous logic and
little character development. The laughable subtitled dialogue may have
been lost in the translation, so that's excusable. Characters'
motivations were paper thin, and there was simply not enough time to
lay it out properly, leading to ridiculous interactions between almost
everybody.<br /><br />Okay, now that is out of the way, I have to say I LOVED this film. The
premise is courageous and exceedingly captivating. The young actors
pull off their roles tremendously well, especially the principle
characters.<br /><br />Highlights for me: The frightened and spastic ways that the children
handled the weapons, i.e. missing 'easy' shots that scared kids would
probably miss, too.<br /><br />The lighting/scenery. It set the mood perfectly. I'm no
cinematographer, but I love movies like this that look beautiful and
don't draw the mind away from the plot. Music was appropriate.<br /><br />I believed the relationship between the male/female leads. That sounds
simple, but is very hard to achieve in this context.<br /><br />Several moments of subtle black humor that were not 'comic relief' as
in most American suspense films.<br /><br />Did I mention the premise? It took balls to make this movie, period.<br /><br />As for the issue of a remake. Let Tarantino have a go at this one. But
please, God, not Oliver Stone. I think an independently financed,
reasonably-budgeted movie could happen. Who has the courage? Yeah, it
will probably never happen.<br /><br />If I ran the circus........<br /><br />I suggest not doing a strict remake. I would cut down on the number of
characters, probably in half, to enhance the characters. I would make
it a long film, perhaps 2.5 hours, and do something the Japanese
filmmaker didn't: Make it believable. Show these poor children as they
descend into madness. Show the inner conflict more. Keep the ages of
the kids the same, but find a couple very young-looking adults so that
seduction can be used to it's full extent (you know which character I
mean). It's an exploitation film, no doubt, so go ahead and show some
skin, and throw in lots of stuff to make people cringe. And don't go
overboard trying to make a social or political statement. It works just
fine as a &quot;what if&quot; experiment.<br /><br />I don't condone remakes in most cases, but there are filmmakers who
could do MUCH better that the awesome original.
