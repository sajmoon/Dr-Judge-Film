This movie is Kinji Fukasaku&#39;s legacy. With this visual interpretation
of Koushun Takami&#39;s novel of the same name, Fukasaku managed to not
only portray the horror described in the novel, but also keep its
social commentary intact. <br /><br />&#39;Battle Royale&#39; is set in a future where Japan&#39;s baby-boom generation
have succumbed to their deepest fears and anxieties regarding the
ever-widening social gap between the older adults and teenagers. The
adults not only fear the &#39;confused&#39; teenagers, but marginalise and
punish them, as unemployment levels reach an all-time high, and the
economy begins to suffer. Because of this hysteria, teenagers
frequently boycott school and turn to crime as an outlet for their
frustrations and the media and government frequently prey on this for
their own gains, hyperbolising every case and creating hysteria and a
teenage-baiting frenzy amongst the older generations. Eventually the
government instigates the BR act; an act which creates an impartial
lottery forcing a random high school class to take part in an
all-or-nothing game of survivalism. The winner is the sole survivor.
The prize for victory is life. <br /><br />The movie is quite often breathtaking. Not in a way which suggests
facing something of beauty, but more in a way which suggests staring
into the face of horror, and feeling it stare back. <br /><br />When I first saw this movie, I was in my last year of high school. No
other movie has shocked and disgusted me as much as &#39;Battle Royale&#39; did
when I first watched it.<br /><br />&#39;Battle Royale&#39; is directed in an energetic, yet sombre way. The
opening sequences are confused and sporadic, yet they convey a lot of
information regarding the setting and the mood of the movie. The camera
at times shows frenzied, close-ups of violence, and at other times
remains cold, distant and detached from it. All the while during the
violence, a number scrolls along the bottom of the screen, showing
statistics about the violence that ensues upon the island; it really
adds to the grotesque nature of the horror you are made to witness. <br /><br />The island which the movie portrays is shown as having been abandoned
to nature, allowing the viewer to really feel the loneliness and fear
that all the students face, even within the cliques some have chosen to
stay in. Throughout the movie, you are given small flashbacks or clues
given by other characters about their fellow classmates, the teacher
and the government. Each character, regardless of how minor, adds to
the horror of the film. The teenage actors in this film do an excellent
job in portraying their fears, anxieties, frustrations and terror at
having to outwit or kill their fellow classmates. Even when things are
merely alluded to, they are often portrayed in such a way as to make it
obvious to the viewer. There are many scenes from the book that simply
could not be shown in the movie, but are still described by other
characters or shown after the fact. The subtlety of the movie is one of
its strong points. <br /><br />The score, utilising a beautiful set of classical European
compositions, really helps to add to the juxtapositions of the
innocuous and mundane with the deadly and the extreme, which are
apparent throughout the movie. One recurring composition in particular
effortlessly conveys the feeling of tragedy with such gravitas that
it&#39;s difficult not to feel moved by some scenes. <br /><br />There are various actors whom you should look out for in the movie.
&quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi as the jaded and amusingly deranged teacher/br game
leader, Masanobu Ando as the Holden Caulfield-esquire protagonist Shuya
Nanahara, Tatsuya Fujiwara as the deranged and homicidal Kiriyama, and
Kou Shibasaki as the stunning, but murderous sociopath Mitsuko. They
were all scene stealing actors who give staggering performances
throughout.<br /><br />In conclusion, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is the kind of movie that is bound to
leave an impression on you, regardless of the kind of movies you
normally like to watch. It&#39;s brutal, it&#39;s tense and it&#39;s tragic. Well
worth a watch, especially if you can get a hold of the extended
version.
