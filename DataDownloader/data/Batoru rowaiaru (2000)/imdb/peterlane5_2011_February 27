A brutal and at times disturbing Drama/Thriller. I wouldn&#x27;t call it an
action movie because it&#x27;s so much more than that. As violent as it is,
it is also beautiful in a way. Plot: In the near future society is on
the verge of collapse. School children boycott schools and begin
rioting. Out of fear and desperation to regain control, the Japanese
government passes an act that as punishment the chosen students must
fight to the death on a deserted island in a reality show type game
until there is only one left alive. This chronicles a chosen 9th grade
class. Some give up immediately by suicide, others band together and
try to find a way off the island, while some just enjoy the killing. Be
warned this is a very violent and bloody film(but it isn&#x27;t really any
more bloody than Kill Bill: Vol 1). The whole concept of teenagers
being pitted against each other to fight to the death is disturbing but
it raises the questions; &#x22;How far would you go to survive? Would you
kill your best friend or sacrifice yourself to save them?&#x22; Despite it&#x27;s
violence, this is a pretty good movie. This movie shows that even in
the worst of situations a bond can be formed that will never be broken.
Most of the characters are well developed and it&#x27;s sad to see most of
them meet a violent end. While watching the movie, I got a &#x22;Lord of the
Flies&#x22; vibe from it and anyone who has read the book has to check this
out. I really enjoyed the ending, it&#x27;s touching and I don&#x27;t want to
spoil anything but it ends on a sort of happy note. and I will say this
I shed a tear. I&#x27;ve heard that the sequel isn&#x27;t as good but I still
want to see it and see what the surviving characters are doing. As
violent as this movie is, it&#x27;s one of those movies you must see. See
