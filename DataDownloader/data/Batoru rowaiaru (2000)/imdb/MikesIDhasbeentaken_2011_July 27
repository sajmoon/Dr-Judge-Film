There are certain films, that will come along, and will always be
recognised as a cult classic. But this status does not do this film
justice.<br /><br />Its the kind of film that should be up there with the best, whose name
should be compared with the greats.<br /><br />most &#x27;asian extreme&#x27; films are normally quite good, always offering
something different. For me, this is where i started to watch them, and
i&#x27;m sure anyone that watches Battle Royal today, will soon be watching
more, not just &#x27;the ring&#x27; or &#x27;the grudge&#x27;, but &#x27;Audition&#x27;, and &#x27;a tale
of two sisters&#x27;.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no point in trying to explain this film, the film does that far
better than anyone could put down in words, just watch it, and after,
watch the sequel, which, although not as good as this, is also a great
film.<br /><br />As the title states, i believe everyone, at some point in their life,
should watch this film.
