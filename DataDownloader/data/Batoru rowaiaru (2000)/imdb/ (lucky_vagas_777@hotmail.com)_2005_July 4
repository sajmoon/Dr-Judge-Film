Battle royal's plot takes place in a modern Japan that is being overrun
by children, the government see's teenagers as a threat. So to combat
this they capture teenagers, strands them on a island and forces them
into a bloody competition where they have three days to kill each other
until their is one survivor left, the winner earns freedom. If more
than one person is left on the island they all die, via exploding neck
collar, if they try to leave same thing. Its pretty easy to see the
social commentary, but just for the slow its basically mirroring the
competition that Japenese students go through.<br /><br />Good movie -Rex Coal<br /><br />check out my site for more of my reviews http://black-face.tripod.com/
