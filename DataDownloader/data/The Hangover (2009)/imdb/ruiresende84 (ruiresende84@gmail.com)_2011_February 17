Comedy is a hard genre. It&#x27;s really hard to find talented comedy actors
that make us laugh without feeling empty in doing it. I&#x27;m not talking
about the easy laugh of an arranged false situation where you just
laugh at the awkwardness of the scene. True comedy is closer to true
drama than to anything else. That&#x27;s what i think. But once in a while,
one can find a decent comedy, that succeeds in the performances. More
rare is to watch something that does something interesting on the
narrative level. This is the case.<br /><br />The performances are standard routine in what concerns today&#x27;s physical
acting and word timing. This is the part of the thing that usually gets
outdated so soon, so i suspect that in 15 years we&#x27;ll no longer laugh
at the phrasing, timing, or even most of the written jokes. Zach
Galifianakis is the exception. He acts really funny because he&#x27;s the
only character who doesn&#x27;t act to be funny. He doesn&#x27;t force his comic
act into the audiences. He stands outside the comic forces of the film,
quite literally, as his character is an alien forced upon the well
acquainted group. So he just stands there, and there resides the fun of
his performance.<br /><br />The nice thing here is done on the narrative structure of the thing.
The story is about a group of guys who don&#x27;t remember what happened the
night before (drugs, booze, etc.). They are given clues (the baby, the
tiger, the police car) which are the links to those unremembered
events. Following those leads, in a sort of a twisted detective story
mechanics, they will be able to retell the events they don&#x27;t remember.
So, the narrative structure is that these characters will reveal a
story that has already happened, to Them! This is a fun concept, and a
clever device. And it is really rare to find clever structures applied
to mainstream comedy.<br /><br />Well the unveiling of the missing puzzle pieces of their night is not
as great as it might have been. The Mike Tyson episode is forced upon
the narrative, probably there to include Tyson and sell some more
tickets with his presence, but it just feels out of place, a scene from
another movie. But overall, this is OK.<br /><br />My opinion: 3/5<br /><br />http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com
