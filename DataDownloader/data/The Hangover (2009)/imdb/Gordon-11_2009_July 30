The Hangover is about a group of 4 guys going to Las Vegas for a
bachelor party just two days before the wedding.<br /><br />Though bachelor party films are so overdone, The Hangover puts a fresh
spin on the whole concept. The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I
like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as
they wake up from their eventful night. It&#x27;s so refreshing to see them
trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they
really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it&#x27;s out of the world.
Basically the film is unbelievably funny, you have to see it to believe
it.
