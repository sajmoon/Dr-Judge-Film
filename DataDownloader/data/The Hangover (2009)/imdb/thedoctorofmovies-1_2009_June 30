MovieRantsByTheDoctor.Blogspot.Com <br /><br />This experience has me wanting to be hungover, in Vegas, not
remembering a thing! You have to admit sometimes the most
interesting/invigorating thing you can do is freak out about what you
did last night, and try to put the pieces together! I&#x27;d say that would
make a great movie but no...they went beyond that and made the movie
gut busting. I&#x27;d say I haven&#x27;t laughed that hard for a movie in a long
time. Bradley Cooper was great he was the cool guy in the group who had
a lot of the ideas, the cracks about his life were awesome and I am
sure something all guys can relate too (especially the family men). Its
crazy how they had the regular circle of friends for the movie, the
&#x22;smart&#x22; one (Ed Helmes&#x27; character...Andy from the Office) who did some
really stupid stuff, marrying Heather Graham though was the smartest
thing he has ever done, would be any man&#x27;s dream come true. The &#x22;cool&#x22;
one, Bradley Cooper&#x27;s character mentioned earlier, and the &#x22;retarded&#x22;
one, (Zach Galifianakis) he was so dumb because basically he was comic
relief for a comic which just basically added to the laughs. I am
pretty sure his character in a baby standing silent with those glasses
on made me laugh.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know what to say I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about
this movie, at some point I was put off but I can&#x27;t remember when
because they immediately recovered with an awesome laugh. <br /><br />So that&#x27;s what I am going to do I am going to say only positive things
about it and just say that if you are feeling blue and in need of good
medicine, this movie deals out the best of it and in mega quantities.
So go see The Hangover for a good time!
