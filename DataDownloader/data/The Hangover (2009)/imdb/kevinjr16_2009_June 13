This movie is definitely worth seeing. The entire cast is hilarious and
the story is goofy but not silly. Think Harold and kumar meets road
trip. I went in expecting a mediocre movie with a few laughs but i was
laughing the entire time and it was just as good as knocked up or the
40 year old virgin. This is not your over done Vegas movie. This is 4
guys getting as fu**ed up as they can get in one night and then the
hell they go through the next day. Without spoiling anything, lets just
say it involves chapels and the Chinese. I will be seeing this movie in
the theatres at least once more. Do yourself a favor and go see this
movie.
