if you like these fast paced, sarcastic and well acted movies this is
the one for you. i am a big fan of Zach Galifianakis. seriously, this
guy is a wonderful actor. not to take anything from the rest of the
cast, i will go see anything he because he just delivers.<br /><br />great cinematography, excellent guest appearances roster.. but
specifically, the characters are so greatly combined in the story line,
with personal development stories and unique personalities that just
work!<br /><br />what else can i tell u? honestly, it&#x27;s best not to know much... just go
watch it and get ready for some fun, laugh and a lot of &#x22;... holly
s***t i cannot believe i just saw this!!!&#x22;<br /><br />it most definitely enters the classic cult ones like out cold.<br /><br />we want more!
