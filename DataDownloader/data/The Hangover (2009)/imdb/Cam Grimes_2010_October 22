I went into this film expecting to laugh. But I didn&#x27;t expect to come
out laughing as hard as I was!<br /><br />I couldn&#x27;t imagine how much effort went into making this film as funny
as it was. The story, characters, and, most importantly, the one
liners, were all perfectly executed.<br /><br />Everyone in the cinema was laughing at every joke! To pull that off is
amazing! I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before. To this day my
friends and I talk about how funny it was.<br /><br />Boundaries were pushed, a**es were laughed off, tears were cried.
Absolutely brilliant film!!!!
