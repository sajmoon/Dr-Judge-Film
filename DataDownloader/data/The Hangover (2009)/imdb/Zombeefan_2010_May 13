The hype surrounding this film was enough for me to give it a watch,
and while the movie itself was decent and funny, the best moments of
comedy come not from the film itself, but from the stills of what
happened during the wild night in Vegas.<br /><br />Now I won&#x27;t say the film is a total let down, some of the scenarios are
quite funny and watching the group trying to put the events of the
night back together and seeing their escapades unfold makes for some
good short laughs or quick smiles, but so much more could have been
achieved if the film went into a different direction. The simple plot
device of a bachelor party weekend in Vegas can provide so much fodder
to work with, and I am sure that a great writer could have incorporated
numerous scenarios into place to make a great flick, even coupling the
events of the night with the escapades of the day after, but instead we
are kind of left sifting through the unknown aftermath, and while it
may come off as funny a lot of jokes don&#x27;t work like they should
because you don&#x27;t know what led them to that particular point.<br /><br />It is still an enjoyable watch, but it does leave a lot to be desired.
