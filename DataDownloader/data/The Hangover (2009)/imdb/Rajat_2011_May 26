Whatta movie!! Wow. Hangover is the best comedy movie ever made. Don&#x27;t
read anything else. Just go and watch the movie.<br /><br />How the hell did they manage to find this guy Alan. and why haven&#x27;t we
seen him any other movie till now?! Alan is superb, the spine of the
movie if i can say. Stu is hilarious and Phil is the kinda guy we all
want to be - cooler than ice.<br /><br />Great script, superb performances, the merc looks stunning and so does
Tracy in the bridal dress. and the soundtracks are too good. I&#x27;ve been
running around to get all the songs from this movie for so long now!<br /><br />Well even if you have a crazy bunch of friends like these guys, you
have to watch this masterpiece. 10 on 10.
