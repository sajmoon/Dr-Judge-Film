I saw this movie very recently on a DVD and now I regret as to why and
how I missed it theatrically. Its amazing movie, and I totally fell in
love with the characters. God, may be I liked the movie &#x27;coz there has
been many occasions when I have landed in the same situation where I
completely lost my mind and woke up the next morning remembering
nothing. Hahaha!!!! And really the situation becomes really
embarrassing when there are people around you who saw me doing all
f***ing funny things and were completely on their perfect mind. Hhahaha
.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everybody. This is really a great movie and
you will laugh to every bit part of its one liners. Great Job!!! Though
the movie is essentially a Male Movie, and I am damn sure almost 90% of
the lot would find (at least a tiny bit) of their life&#x27;s fun in it!!!
Thanks a lot Warner Bros.
