God only knows when the last time I actually laughed at a &#x22;comedy&#x22; film
that I saw in the theater. Most &#x22;comedy&#x22; films are full of poor acting,
recycled garbage, terrible jokes and toilet humor. I mean, how many
times can you see the same thing over, and over, and over again, before
it gets as stale as a bag of month old potato chips?<br /><br />With that said, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was BRILLIANT! Finally a comedy film
directed towards a mature audience with mature humor. The characters
worked extremely well together, and the plot was, actually interesting.<br /><br />So many comedy films these days are so, ridiculously, stupid, there
isn&#x27;t much of a plot at all, just lame jokes and cardboard acting. This
film took it to the next level, and it&#x27;s the first time, in forever, I
can say I actually laughed out loud at a comedy film.<br /><br />OUTSTANDING!!! For MATURE audiences only
