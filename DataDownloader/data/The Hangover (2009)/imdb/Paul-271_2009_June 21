I as well as my wife truly enjoyed this movie and neither of us
expected to. In fact, the entire theater broke up laughing more often
than not - and at the appropriate times too. One odd comment is that a
family brought their son, perhaps aged 3, to this one and even he
laughed at several funny slapstick sort of moments. This kid&#x27;s laughter
caused others like us around him to laugh even more.<br /><br />As a note about kids; this movie definitely earned its R rating. I
suppose a 3 year old isn&#x27;t badly affected by this movie because all the
R stuff went over his head, but if you are offended by sex jokes or
situations, avoid this one at all costs. Both my wife and I were
surprised at how much one can get into an R rating. We thought we&#x27;d
stumbled into some other rating but then again, I don&#x27;t know what else
their is either.<br /><br />Mostly what&#x27;s fun about this movie is that it has a good spirit. It&#x27;s
not mean although some of the situations the &#x27;boys&#x27; get themselves into
can feel pretty tense. If you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie depends if you have a
sense of the absurd as well as if you feel comfortable with openly
sexual situations. If you say &#x22;No&#x22; to either of those, you just can&#x27;t
enjoy this thoroughly modern absurdest comedy.
