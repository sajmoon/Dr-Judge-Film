I&#x27;ve never actually written a review on IMDb before. After seeing the
ridiculous ratings this movie received, I had to make an account. I
enjoyed movies like Super Bad and Wedding Crashers, so I thought this
couldn&#x27;t be much different(plus everyone&#x27;s been so hyped up about it).
IT&#x27;S CRAP. Almost all the jokes are lame and fall flat throughout the
whole movie. I maybe smiled/laughed twice? It makes me think that
people who rated it highly must have been so drunk or f*cked up when
they watched it. The actors suck. It all seems so forced that it&#x27;s
embarrassing. The type of scenario in this movie has been so over done.
I&#x27;m bored of it.
