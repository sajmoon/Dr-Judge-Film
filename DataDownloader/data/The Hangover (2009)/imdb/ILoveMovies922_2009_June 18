Jon Lucas &#x26; Scott Moore have written a delightful comedy. I liked the
movie better than the title. <br /><br />Given today&#x27;s marketplace of coming of age comedies, teen comedies,
young adult comedies and just plain old comedies, The Hangover
succeeds. <br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t have the novelty effect of 40 Year Old Virgin or of The
Wedding Crashers, but still I thought it was enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The actors live up to the well written script. <br /><br />Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather
Graham, Sasha Barrese, Jeffrey Tambor work very well together. As well
as with the director, Todd Phillips.<br /><br />As the director, Phillips does a very nice job of having his actors
involved in comedic antics, while moving the story along at a nice
pace. <br /><br />I believe that it was at the top of the charts when it first opened and
that it has been doing pretty well since.
