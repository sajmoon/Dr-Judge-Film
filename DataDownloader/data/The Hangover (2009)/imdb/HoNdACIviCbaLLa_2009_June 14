When i went into the theatre to see this i had heard some pretty good
reviews from online sources or just some friends that told me it was
funny. Still, I really didn&#x27;t know if it would be the kind of movie
that had a few funny scenes but nothing too special. It turned out I
was extremely happy with my choice to pay to see it in theatres, this
movie was awesome.There is plenty of those one liners you will be
repeating with your friends for a long time. I laughed a lot more than
I usually do with comedy films, the last movie that made me laugh this
much was Superbad,which most of us know was a classic...anyways don&#x27;t
waste anymore time,go see this movie, you wont regret it I promise.
