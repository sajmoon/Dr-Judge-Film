The Hangover takes a standard premise and turns it into a hilarious
comedy that combines raunchy humor with &#x22;what&#x27;s going to be next&#x22;
mystery. After the crazy bachelor party, the three guys can&#x27;t remember
virtually anything about what actually has happened and where the groom
can be. This simple concept appears to be very productive and the team
of screenwriters squeezes all the juice out of it providing plenty of
laugh-out-loud scenes. The humor not only stems from frequently absurd
situations the guys come across, but also their mostly hilarious
interactions. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis make for a
great comedy trio playing characters of totally different
personalities. Phil (Cooper) is a party animal; Stu (Helms) is a
pragmatist; and Alan (Galifianakis) seems to live in his own bizarre
world. They all bring different elements to the film. Galifianakis is
especially hilarious delivering totally unhinged, yet perfectly likable
performance. Even though The Hangover is not sufficiently heartfelt or
powerful to be a classic in my book, it still delivers more than enough
laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through.
