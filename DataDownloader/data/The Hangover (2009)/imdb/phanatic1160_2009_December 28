expecting a laugh riot after the huge buzz and the top rating here on
IMDb, i was rather disappointed by this &#x27;chuckle-fest&#x27;. the first smile
didn&#x27;t cross my face until about half an hour into the movie, which is
way too long for a comedy. <br /><br />this movie consists of a rather uninspired plot without any really
fresh ideas, and of dialogue that seems mostly improvised. the endless
&#x27;beauty&#x27; shots of vegas also struck me as either needless
runtime-padding or product placement.<br /><br />the solid efforts by the main cast make this one barely above average.<br /><br />(imdb: the 10-line minimum on these reviews is really annoying!)
