Nothing more then a deranged completely unashamed thrill ride of
laughs, This film delights itself in mocking, teasing and outright
twisting things that would normally be frowned upon if they were ever
committed in real life.<br /><br />Showing a fairly accurate portrayal of how things can get out of
control in Vegas, The film follows the exploits of Phil, Stu and Alan.
Three guys who one day go out on a stag-night to the city of sin itself
before a wedding with Groom-to-be Doug who goes missing the following
day next morning leading to the three trying to piece together the
events of what exactly happened during that crazy last night in which
they were all tipsy and out of their minds.<br /><br />Characters swear like sailors, Propert is broken and smashed, Danger is
made a complete laughing stock, all put together to form one anacarhic
and funny comedies. I especially laughed at the &#x22;pretending to ***k a
tiger scene. With the amount of raunchy jokes and a scene of full
frontal male nudity, This is definitely not one for the kids or
grandparents.
