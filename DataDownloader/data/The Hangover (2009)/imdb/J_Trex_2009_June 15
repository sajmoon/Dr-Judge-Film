I saw this move last night, for the 2nd time, and can say, without
question, this is the funniest movie of the year, or possibly any other
year. Where to begin? Give credit to the writers first and foremost,
because this was LOL funny from start to finish and the storyline and
dialog kept the comedy pace going throughout. There weren&#x27;t any slow
spots.<br /><br />The acting was pitch perfect, from the main characters to those with
secondary roles, including brief cameo appearances. Zach Galifianakis,
in a breakthrough role, was great as the goofy brother-in-law to be, Ed
Helms was outstanding as the Dentist buddy, Brad Cooper also great as
the hipster friend, brief appearances by Rob Riggle as the cop, Matt
Walsh as the Doctor at the Hospital, Jeff Tambor as the father-in-law,
Mike Tyson as himself, and the Wedding Singer (Dan Finnerty) in one of
the funniest bits in the movie (he sings 50 Cent&#x27;s &#x22;Candyshop&#x22;), and
numerous others actors, really contributed to the film.<br /><br />The film also finished strong, with a great ending that tied everything
up nicely, with the closing minutes the high point of the film.<br /><br />A great movie, an instant classic I would add. Can&#x27;t wait for the DVD
to come out.
