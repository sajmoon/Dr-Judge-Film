The Hangover is a very funny movie with several parts in the movie that
made me laugh out loud for quite a while, my friends too and the whole
audience also obviously really enjoyed it. This movie is better than
most of the new comedies I&#x27;ve seen in the last couple years or so. The
performances are good with all of the actors knowing their roles and
getting really good laughs with the parts they&#x27;ve been given. On the
down side there are a few parts where they go for too easy a joke or a
joke you can see coming, or where the movie drags without any laughs
for a while, but all things considered this is still well worth seeing
if not at the movies then rent it when it comes out on DVD.
