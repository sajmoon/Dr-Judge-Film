I can not remind myself that I&#x27;ve laughed this much for a long time.
Everything from start to finish offers a wonderful blend of humor, so I
think everyone will find something they like in this movie. It&#x27;s hard
not to find a favorite character because all the characters have so
many things to offer.<br /><br />After seeing this movie for the third time, I think it has exactly the
same charm as the first time. I will probably look at it many more
times in the future and that says a lot about the movie. I recommend it
to anyone who has not seen it and if it&#x27;s been a long time since you
saw it, watch it again! It&#x27;s worth it.
