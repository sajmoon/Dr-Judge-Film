Well produced, generally well directed, generally well-acted. The
technical work and editing do help push the creaky old storyline along.<br /><br />The writing is so-so. The narrative structure is tepid, punctuated with
precious few fleeting flashes of cleverness.<br /><br />In short, the writers/producers believed that over-the-top
acting/directing could carry a movie with a narrative premised on a
drug-induced &#x22;lost night&#x22;. If there was some kind of brilliant twist or
tour-de-force, it would redeem the exercise. Unfortunately, the
development is a surprisingly prosaic, vanilla treatment of the
premise.<br /><br />I know this approach works OK for some folks. I watched this on the
recommendation of a guy I&#x27;d just met who seemed like a pretty smart
fellow. But it turns out to have been a pretty tame product. If you
expect quality narrative from a movie, skip it.
