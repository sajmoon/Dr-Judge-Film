The makers of this film copied the style of the Farrelly brothers, you
know the guys that brought you Dumb and Dumber(1994),Kingpin(1996),and
There&#x27;s something about Mary(1998). And came up to being as good and
entertaining.<br /><br />It begins with four friends Phil(Bradley Cooper), Alan(Zach
Galifianakis), Stu(Ed Helms), and Doug(Justin Bartha). Decide to go to
Las Vegas for a bachelor party, there friend Doug is getting married,
so they wild night of celebrating, and swore this would be a night they
would never forget. Well next day they realize that it really was a
night that they did forget. Everything is messed up, they feel out of
it. To make matters worse the groom to be Doug has gone missing.
Murphys law ensues as they try to find there friend. Will they find him
in time before the wedding? <br /><br />This was one funny raunchy,slapstick comedy. Everything was timed
perfectly, I mean every joke and every gag. And there are no scene
steelers, every character shines in a comedic way. A perfect adult
comedy, it never once gets boring or stupid for a second.
