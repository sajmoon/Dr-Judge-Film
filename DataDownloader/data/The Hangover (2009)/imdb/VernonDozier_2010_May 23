I realize comedy is subjective and it is hard to convince someone who&#x27;s
laughing that the gag he just guffawed over isn&#x27;t really funny. So to
be helpful to those debating whether to see it or not, I offer this. If
you found the movie &#x22;Sideways&#x22; unfunny and overrated, you will probably
find this one unfunny and overrated as well. Both feature the same
inattention to the most essential ingredient in comedy: timing. Both
feature mostly unlikeable characters. Both are basically boring.<br /><br />Some here have criticized The Hangover as racist, sexist, or just
gross. If done right, such politically incorrect ingredients don&#x27;t
prevent me from laughing, and sometimes they actually enhance a comedy
if done right. But those ingredients are not funny just in and of
themselves. The Hangover brought me one or two mild laughs. The rest
was just gross or otherwise offensive without any imagination behind
it. There are no &#x22;I can&#x27;t believe they just did that&#x22; laughs here. The
gags are stale and occasionally cruel, and the characters are
unsympathetic. I&#x27;m stunned at the popularity of this garbage.
