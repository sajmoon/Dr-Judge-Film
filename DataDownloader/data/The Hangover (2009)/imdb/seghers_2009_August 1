I almost gave this movie a 10. But comedies are hard to do, and there
are some slight imperfections. The characters were not really well
defined before the fun starts. It might have been a little more
interesting if we&#x27;d known more about the groom and the best man, who I
guess was a bad teacher who doesn&#x27;t like kids? Not sure. Anyway...
that&#x27;s not what this movie is about. In short, I loved this movie. My
wife and I laughed our heads off. It has a great ear for the way people
talk, and the one-liners fit well into the story and connect with the
personalities of the characters. I love the way it starts the morning
AFTER (hence the title) and the characters have to piece back together
what happened. I guarantee this- you have never before been so
compelled to stay seated for the closing credits as you will be for
this movie- I wont say why. I laughed HARD from start to finish, and
VERY strongly recommend this comedy to anybody who has just once
understood what it was like to party JUST a little bit too hard....
