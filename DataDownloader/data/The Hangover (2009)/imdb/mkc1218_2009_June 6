The Hangover will make you want to grab your credit card and call your
travel agent. (Luckily I don&#x27;t have to, I am leaving for Vegas on
Thursday. And I only wish I have half as much fun as these guys did.)<br /><br />Rowdy, raucous, and a touch raunchy, The Hangover comes at you with
full comic force and doesn&#x27;t let up, even through the end credits. This
is a comedy the way I like my comedies: untamed and out of control. I
laughed my (synonym for donkey) off.<br /><br />After sitting through what seems like my 500th bromance, how wonderful
for a movie to pull out the comic stops with a clever story and so many
great gags that you&#x27;ll be talking about long after the lights come up.<br /><br />The casting and performances are PERFECT. (Zach
Getastagenameforgodssake finally has a breakout role!!) The direction
is spot on.<br /><br />And Heather Graham, darling, you look as good as ever at 39. If I were
married, I would leave my wife for you.<br /><br />Bruno, you have a hard movie to top.
