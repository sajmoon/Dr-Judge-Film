I laughed once at this movie, where the wedding singer does 50 Cent&#x27;s
&#x27;Candy Shop&#x27;. Apart from this, nothing. The acting was okay, the
characters too. The main thing that was lacking was a good script. You
know what you&#x27;re gonna get with one of these kind of movies, but
unfortunately this just didn&#x27;t deliver. I had a few beers before, and
was ready to laugh.... but this movie just couldn&#x27;t deliver them.
Shame, because the premise sounded fairly good. I don&#x27;t like trashing
movies, but I think it&#x27;s best that if you must see this movie, then
don&#x27;t expect a lot, and you won&#x27;t be too disappointed. I know lots of
people rated it highly, but I can&#x27;t think why for the life of me. I&#x27;m
not a prude, and laughed pretty good at Stepbrothers and stuff of this
ilk, which you can call puerile and stupid. I&#x27;m just very disappointed
that the most important thing of the whole film was just not up to it,
cos everything else was there. Sorry guys!
