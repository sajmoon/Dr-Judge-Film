Four friends go to Las Vegas to give one of them, Doug (Bartha), a
bachelor party he will never forget. The next morning three of them
wake up with no memory of what happened the night before and they can&#x27;t
find Doug.<br /><br />This movie is a perfect example for not believing the hype when it
comes to comedies. The new rule is if the movie is hyped too much (and
it was), don&#x27;t go see it, or leave the DVD on the shelf. This new rule
should become a law. I&#x27;m working on that. <br /><br />No good lines, just the usual banter when not one of them can remember
anything. Eventually, they find clues that tells them things, but not
the whole story. No good physical comedy either. Nothing was funny. No
one stepped forward with the kind of timing comedy demands. No one. Oh,
there are some gross comments, but I wouldn&#x27;t call them funny or even
humorous. I guess they were expected to be made. <br /><br />And, here they are in Las Vegas. One would think there would be more
shots of Vegas than there was. Total loss here. At this point I am
wondering if the director was one of the three and forgot he had a
movie to direct. Sad is all I can say.<br /><br />I would simply call this a slice of life as would happen to you and to
me. Nothing funny, just straight up concern for what happened and where
is Doug? That kind of slice. No one even tried to be funny. See? Also,
I am convinced there was a reason that the actors weren&#x27;t nationally
known. Well, except for Jeffrey Tabor, but his character didn&#x27;t go to
Vegas. <br /><br />Wait a minute. I did laugh once. When the three are hauled into the
police station and to get out of the damage they did, they made a deal
and volunteered to be tasered to show school children what happens when
someone is tasered. Kind of OMGish, but I have to admit to laughing.<br /><br />Now I must issue a warning. They find the camera and the camera
pictures tell them all they need to know about that night when they
couldn&#x27;t remember what happened. These pictures run during the credits
and do show nudity, and simulated sex. Again, there is also nothing
funny in these pictures. Just some are crude.<br /><br />After watching many of these so-called comedies I just know I need to
find my real home planet. In the meantime, I am going to abide by the
new rule.<br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, via the pictures at the end. Nudity: Yes, via
the pictures at the end. Language: Yes.
