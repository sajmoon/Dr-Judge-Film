Because of the hype, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m a fan of
Wedding Crashers, Role Models, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and I expected
this film to be of the same general caliber. It was, in many ways.<br /><br />However, this film is definitely a dude-flick (paralleling the
*chick-flick*) as it explores the male-escape fantasy through a device
I will not reveal due to IMDb&#x27;s scary spoiler laws. I feel like it
crossed the line several times in regards to a woman&#x27;s sense of humor
and her tolerance toward &#x22;humor&#x22; using violent sexual offenses,
pedophile-related jokes, and sexualized breastfeeding--hard to make the
ladies bust out laughing with this list of serious icks and no-no&#x27;s.<br /><br />The other annoying part of this film was its audience. Sadly, half the
theater was filled with &#x22;gentlemen&#x22; that had seen it before and were
either yelling things like &#x22;OH GOD, I LOVE THIS PART&#x22; before the scene
happened, giggling during silences in the movie, or naming the item
(repeatedly) that is making him laugh so hard in the first place.<br /><br />I think movies like this should be made, and I&#x27;m so glad men are
laughing and enjoying themselves--but ladies--you may decide to just
let the guys go ahead and enjoy this one their own. Having seen &#x22;The
Proposal&#x22; last weekend, I would definitely save my money and go see
that with your girls instead. Hilarious, worth the ticket price, and a
genuinely good time.
