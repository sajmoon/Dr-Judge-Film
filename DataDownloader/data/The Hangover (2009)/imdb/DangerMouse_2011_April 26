This movie was absolutely one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. I
laughed so hard I almost choked and died; and it would have been a good
way to go.<br /><br />This movie is EPIC, like up there with Spinal Tap. I kept laughing for
days. The only way I can think to describe it: If Pulp Fiction had a
baby with the Wedding Crashers and gave it up for adoption to the Three
Stooges. The movie has that weird, skewed-world feeling to it. The
language is outrageous - there&#x27;s not a ton of violence, but what&#x27;s
there is like, &#x22;omg!&#x22; Things don&#x27;t quite make sense. You have to just
roll with it and embrace the randomness - but it&#x27;s easy to do that
because the wackiness is pee-your-pants hysterical. The characters are
utterly irreverent and so likable. A few times I couldn&#x27;t catch my
breath I was laughing so hard. Oh sh*t..just watch it.
