Yes, a raunchy comedy revolving around guys who have had a few too many
is the year&#x27;s best film so far. It&#x27;s not only the gallons of laughs
that Mike Tyson and Zach Galifianakis are only the start of, it&#x27;s that
this is a great mystery film. The mystery revolves around Doug (Justin
Bartha), a man who&#x27;s about to get married. He goes to Vegas with his
friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms), and his
bride-to-be&#x27;s brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Their perfect night in
Vegas turns into a hangover for the ages. They&#x27;ve lost Doug, and can
not remember a thing from the night before. They must go out to find
Doug. The night before involves a tiger, a chicken, a baby, a stripper
named Jade (Heather Graham), who Stu accidentally marries, and Mike
Tyson. The real joy of this movie is that we&#x27;re as interested to figure
out what the hell happened as much as they do. You feel like you&#x27;re
part of the mystery. The conclusion is nothing less than perfect. When
the end credits roll, you see a bunch of pictures on a camera that show
what really went down that night. It is the perfect finale to a movie
that can only be described as a funnier, raunchier version of Dude,
Where&#x27;s My Car?
