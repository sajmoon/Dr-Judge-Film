The Hangover is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It&#x27;s
clever, crazy and never leaves the viewer bored.<br /><br />Doug (Justin Bartha) is getting married, and his friends want to take
him to Vegas for a bachelor party. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a brash
teacher desperate for fun, Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist with a horribly
controlling girlfriend, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is&#x85;Doug&#x27;s bizarre
brother-in-law to be. The night looks like it will be awesome, but
things get crazy when Stu, Phil and Alan wake up the next morning to a
trashed hotel room complete with a chicken, tiger and baby! Not only
that, but Stu is missing a tooth and Doug is nowhere to be found. So
the three guys set off to find out where their friend is, who the baby
belongs to, and how the tiger ended up in their bathroom. The guys then
go on a crazy two-day adventure figuring out what exactly they did that
fateful night, and how to fix everything in time for Doug&#x27;s wedding.<br /><br />This film is just hilarious, there&#x27;s no other word to describe it. The
guys get into crazy situations with weird twists and turns that are
just confusing to the viewer as the characters. Along with the great
characters and plot, The Hangover is chock full of great one liners and
memorable quotes. If you&#x27;re in the mood for a hilarious adult comedy,
The Hangover is a real good time.
