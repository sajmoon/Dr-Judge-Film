I found reading the reviews of this movie more entertaining than the
movie itself. Yeah, there are some funny moments, but for the most part
it just over-promises and under-delivers. There are so many elements to
the story that go too far over the top, but don&#x27;t have enough absurdity
or humour to make it work. There are plenty of comedies that are more
outrageous than this one, but they pull it off because they have the
comic delivery to make us laugh enough that we just don&#x27;t care. In the
case of The Hangover, the delivery is just not funny, witty or foolish
enough to make any of the major comic devices work. As a result, most
of the content just seems gratuitous and annoying, and falls really
flat.<br /><br />The Hangover is watchable enough, and you will laugh a couple of times,
but don&#x27;t let the over-the-top reviews fool you. It&#x27;s just not that
great. Unoriginal, and stupid in a bad way.<br /><br />One last thing. PLEASE, people, stop comparing this to Wedding
Crashers. It&#x27;s not anywhere near as funny or as well executed. You&#x27;re
just embarrassing yourselves.
