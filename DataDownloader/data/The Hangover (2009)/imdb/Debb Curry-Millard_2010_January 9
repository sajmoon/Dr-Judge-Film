I was really, really looking forward to this film. Every trailer I&#x27;d
seen made me laugh.<br /><br />So Saturday night comes around. It&#x27;s available through Virgin and so
cuddle on the sofa with snacks and start watching it.<br /><br />Keep glancing at Hubbsta as he hadn&#x27;t laughed once and I had to admit
my laughter was a bit forced at times.<br /><br />It was a real shame as I think it could have had more potential. It&#x27;s
for the people who liked AnchorMan, 40 Year Old Virgin that kind of
film.<br /><br />If anything, it had a sweetish ending.
