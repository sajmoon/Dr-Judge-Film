2009_June 20 
Look, from the previews you pretty much know the whole story going in:
some dudes go to Vegas for a bachelor party, get wasted, and wake up
wondering what happened. You should be able to tell going in exactly
what this movie is, and what to expect. If anything, this movie was
much funnier than I expected it would be from seeing the trailer.<br /><br />So, complaining about the fact that The Hangover is juvenile, sexist,
stoopid, etc., says more about the reviewer than it says about the
movie. For what it is, it is quite effective. It made me laugh out loud
numerous times. Ed Helms is great, as is most of the cast. Also, I
think they do a good job of keeping the plot (or what passes for one)
interesting, even though you know from the preview seemingly everything
to expect. The pace is fast, and the laughs are numerous right up until
(and through) the closing credits. What else do you want? Really, the
negative reviews on IMDb do quite a good job of outlining what&#x27;s good
about this movie. Here are some choice quotes from the &#x22;hated it&#x22; pile:<br /><br />&#x22;The humor is crude, sexist, violent&#x22; Duh.<br /><br />&#x22;depraved in a bad way&#x22; <br /><br />You make that sound like a bad thing.<br /><br />&#x22;I could care less about any of the main characters!&#x22; <br /><br />I thought Seinfeld proved that audiences could laugh at characters that
weren&#x27;t likable. Who cares if you don&#x27;t like the characters, as long as
they are funny? <br /><br />&#x22;Ultimately, The Hangover is just a bunch of crude gags strung together
in place of an actual story. It&#x27;s yet another film in which grown-ups
act like teenage nitwits&#x22; <br /><br />Yeah, pretty much. Your point?<br /><br />&#x22;99.9% of the jokes were...tasteless&#x22; <br /><br />Yes. Yes they were. And I laughed at them.<br /><br />&#x22;Definitely not a chick flick.&#x22; <br /><br />Wow, quite the cin&#xE9;aste, you are.<br /><br />&#x22;We are supposed to laugh at someone (admittedly by accident) bashing a
car door into a baby&#x27;s face.&#x22; <br /><br />Hey, I did, but that&#x27;s just me.<br /><br />&#x22;The four main characters in this are all completely lacking a moral
compass and, quite frankly, I would be ashamed if I really knew guys
like these in real life.&#x22; <br /><br />This is a movie, and not real life. So your point is...? <br /><br />&#x22;You have to be concerned about our society when this passes for
entertainment.&#x22; <br /><br />This from a guy who gave a 7 to &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22;. I think the fact
that there&#x27;s a SECOND Transformers movie coming out is a much more
damning indictment of our society than anything in this film.<br /><br />&#x22;This movie, like many other new &#x22;comedies&#x22; contains nothing but
vulgar, offensive humor, the kind of humor that you feel guilty at
laughing at. If you enjoy obscenities being shouted every three
seconds, vulgar jokes, and shock laughs then this movie is right for
you.&#x22; <br /><br />Pretty much, yeah.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you are an uptight moral majority type looking
for a reason to be offended, avoid this film. If you get your panties
in a bunch when adults use adult language, don&#x27;t see this film. If you
want to see a realistic depiction of the horrors of alcohol and drug
abuse, perhaps you should see a different movie. If you go into a movie
called &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, with a plot about a bunch of guys having a
bachelor party in Vegas, expecting that by the end you and the
characters will learn some important life lessons, grow as human
beings, and come away with a more deepened spiritual outlook...perhaps
you are an idiot.<br /><br />If, however, you want to laugh at something stupid for a couple of
hours, check it out. I don&#x27;t know about these other folks, but that&#x27;s
why I go see a comedy. And this one made me laugh. A lot.
