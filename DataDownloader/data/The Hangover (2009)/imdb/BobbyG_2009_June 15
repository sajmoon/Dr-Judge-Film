I heard from two people I know &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was an incredibly funny
movie so when my girlfriend suggested we see it, I said OK. Maybe my
expectations were too high, but I laughed, at most, 5-6 times. There
were some truly offensive and very unfunny parts the crowded theater
found hilarious. You have to be concerned about our society when this
passes for entertainment. I&#x27;m sorry, but liberal use of the &#x22;F&#x22; word
does not make a scene humorous. I rate it a 5 because it is one of the
many lame and average attempts at humor Hollywood has released over the
years. The fact that it currently ranks at #130 of all time over the
likes of Animal House and Something About Mary is truly puzzling.
