If some good, clean fun is what you&#x27;re after, The Hangover is not the
film for you. The film will, however, deliver two out of three (minus
&#x22;clean&#x22;).<br /><br />Director Todd Phillips (Old School, Starsky &#x26; Hutch) offers as much
raunch, wit and general shock value in his newest comedy as the typical
laugh seeker could ask for, and though The Hangover doesn&#x27;t quite reach
the same level of true humor as Old School, it comes close.<br /><br />The film centers around the aftermath of a Vegas bachelor party, the
events of which unfold as the celebrants &#x96; sans the missing groom to be
&#x96; investigate their nocturnal circumstances in order to find their
friend amidst the worst hangovers of their lives. What they find far
surpasses the embarrassing photo or puke-stained clothes that usually
accompany the day after woes of a night of bad decisions.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms deliver solid comedic performances, but
it&#x27;s the uniquely odd yet amusing qualities of Zach Galifianakis&#x27;
performance that transform the film into the laugh-out-loud movie it
is. A supporting role of bubbly Heather Graham also brings the film
some charm.<br /><br />Watch for appearances by Mike Tyson; Matt Walsh, Bryan Callen and Dan
Finnerty (some of Phillips&#x27; staples); and Mr. Phillips himself&#x85;all of
which add an extra &#x22;hey!&#x22; factor to the keen observer.<br /><br />The Hangover doesn&#x27;t breach the cosmic levels of comedic genius we
always hope for, but it makes for an amusing evening. Worth full price.
