Unless you&#x27;re some smug, pretentious, uptight anti-social person that
people don&#x27;t like to hang out with you&#x27;re gonna love this flick. It&#x27;s
hilarious. Off hand the &#x22;group of guys going to Vegas for a bachelor
party&#x22; doesn&#x27;t sound enticing or something that could make for a great
movie since it&#x27;s an epic retread in cinema but director Todd Phillips
takes the idea and runs with it.<br /><br />The movie, unlike most, doesn&#x27;t center around the bachelor party but
the next day as the guys try and trace their way through the night and
figure out what exactly happened the night before in a drunken haze.<br /><br />The flick plays like a whimsical, drug induced detective story. They
chase leads, confront many colorful characters, and find themselves in
and out of trouble while trying to piece together the pieces of the
night before and locate their pal (the groom) who was lost along the
way.<br /><br />The Chemistry of these fellas is outstanding. None of them miss a beat
and they&#x27;re all funny. Of course the lesser known Zach Galifinakis
really shines here as the not all there, cling-on, soon-to-be-brother
in law of the groom. None of his one-liners miss their target and the
sheer sight of him puts a smile on our faces.<br /><br />All in all a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing throughout
and this I promise you. NOW GO SEE IT!
