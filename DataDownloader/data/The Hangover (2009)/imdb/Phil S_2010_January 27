2010_January 27 
When the sum of a film&#x27;s entertaining parts fit into its widely
distributed trailer, you know something is wrong. The humor it devised
itself is absurdly sophomoric, and while that can put a smirk on your
face as you reminisce on your college binge-drinking years, it just
doesn&#x27;t justify an entire film. The rest of the humor, which is
presented awfully, just isn&#x27;t original. The cast is simply bad. Racial
stereotypes are always a winner in movies, and this one just proves it.
Why are we so keen to praise such a film? We&#x27;ll only get more crap like
this if we incessantly tell Hollywood it has us rolling on the floor. A
good concept does not necessarily a good film make, which is damn
unfortunate.
