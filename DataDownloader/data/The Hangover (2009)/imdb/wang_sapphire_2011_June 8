Thought this was just another guys&#x27; film, I didn&#x27;t know I would like it
that much. The movie gives out interwoven surprises and laughter. All
the most impossible things, happened in so many ridiculous ways, and,
when you look back, also so reasonable(yeah, it&#x27;s Vegas...)<br /><br />The story is told in a very clever way. Hurry with the guys to be
shocked by what had happened the night before, witness the faces of
&#x22;how could I/he have done that&#x22;, rediscover the romantic accident,
tumble into unexpected meetings, experience dangers, and embrace the
happen endings. <br /><br />I also like the way those characters interacted in the movie. Sometimes
they got very angry, sometimes they were obsessed with crazy ideas,
just what I thought most people would do in Vegas, but sooner or later,
some of them would get the better judgment, try to cope, and to make
their way out.<br /><br />Finally, this is not a movie just for guys.
