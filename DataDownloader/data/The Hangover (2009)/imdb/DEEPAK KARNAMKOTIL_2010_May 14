Why did I went to watch this movie &#x96;<br /><br />I never noticed when it was released , but slowly it started building
at the Box office .. just like a Stanley Kubrik film and then it was
just every where&#x85; news papers, talk shows, and the marketing of this
film in India was really good. So&#x85; that&#x27;s how I was interested in this
movie, but again, I felt that it would be another brainless Hollywood
sex comedy.<br /><br />Highlighting point of the movie &#x96; Though it was a comedy , it had more
suspense as the film moved ahead&#x85; that is the key point of this movie&#x85;
it is not a predictable story..no &#x85; not at all.. It was like Idiana
Jones &#x85; solving the puzzle and moving ahead for the next clue.. and
this continued till the last frame with rib tickling humor.<br /><br />About the director &#x96;He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and
suspense.<br /><br />Performances &#x96; 1. Zack is the star of this movie 2. Ed Helms is the
second in the performance 3. Ashley is the stylish and sexy 4. Mike
Tyson and his Tiger were awesome 5. The gay Gangsta &#x85; Keng Jeong &#x85;
superb .. look out for his entry 6. The Music<br /><br />Summary &#x96; I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if
the film is good. So , sorry &#x85;. No clues .Just get Hangovered after
watching The Hangover
