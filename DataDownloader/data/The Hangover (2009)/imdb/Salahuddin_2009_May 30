Humorous movie in every aspect.<br /><br />I watched the movie at a preview screening at UBC, so the audience were
all college students. Everyone I talked to so far had loved this movie.<br /><br />The tale of how three friends tries to find the lost groom before his
wedding after their crazy night in Las Vegas. The movie gets funny from
the Las Vegas part right till the end. There is hilarious stuff in
every other scene. Not to be missed, one of the best comedy of 2009.<br /><br />The entrance of Chinese goon is Hilarious, will have you in splits.
They have touched on all types of jokes especially the minor mention of
the different sex (gay, interracial, beastiality) The only movie that I
can think of that is relatively similar is Harold &#x26; Kumar. I recommend
everyone to watch it (not for kids), you wont regret it.
