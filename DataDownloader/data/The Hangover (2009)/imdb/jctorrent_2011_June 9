I lived in Vegas when this was made. I was set-up; by my friend no
less. The double-date from hell. I thought it was going to be a total
disaster: a dirty, raunchy movie, that wasn&#x27;t going to be funny; and
make me look like a jack-ass with my uptight (first) date. The girls
looked like they were ready to bolt for the door.<br /><br />The girls started laughing first. It redeemed it self almost
immediately, and just got better.<br /><br />It&#x27;s possible that we had a bias towards liking it , since we lived
there, and had seen things happen there; like the guy who robbed the
liquor store naked, then went and hijacked a city bus with all it&#x27;s
passengers, still naked, then got in a high speed chase with the cops
and was finally arrested live on TV. So yeah, that&#x27;s typical Vegas for
us. The movie felt so much like home for us, we couldn&#x27;t help but like
it.<br /><br />If you have caviar tastes, this is not the movie for you. For the rest
of us, it&#x27;s money well spent.
