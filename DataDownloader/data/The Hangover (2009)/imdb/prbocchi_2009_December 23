I am a little surprised that this movie has averaged such high reviews.
It seems to be universally well reviewed on the web and many people I
know that have seen it have highly recommended it. This may be the main
reason why I was so disappointed, but overall I thought it was quite an
average road-trip-gone-wrong type of movie and would have rated it as I
have regardless. I certainly didn&#x27;t experience the laugh-a-minute
entertainment that others have mentioned. A faint chuckle here and
there, but that&#x27;s about it.<br /><br />Now I don&#x27;t mind the odd far-fetched &#x22;silly&#x22; movie so I&#x27;m not a prude
when it comes to this type of genre. The premise of the movie had
potential, but the execution just didn&#x27;t quite cut it for me. For
starters, the acting was mediocre. &#x22;That was bad acting&#x22; came to mind
in several scenes. Some of the situations were a little over-the-top,
juvenile, and lacking in comedy. The cops with the tasers is just one
of many examples. If you&#x27;re into &#x22;kicked in the nuts&#x22; kind of humor,
then you may find this really funny, but only barely made me grin.<br /><br />Not the worst comedy I&#x27;ve seen and overall wasn&#x27;t a totally unenjoyable
experience, but certainly (for me) not worthy of the hype it is
receiving.
