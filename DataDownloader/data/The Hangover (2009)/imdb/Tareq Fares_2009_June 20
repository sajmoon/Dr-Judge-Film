Hilarious storyline + Great Cast + Amazingly written <br /><br />=the funniest movie in recent memory<br /><br />This is not your average summer comedy. This is what i call the perfect
medium of low and high comedy. With the exception to Zach Galifianakis,
the cast is not full of colorful characters and hilarious antics, but
rather letting the mysterious wonders that Las Vegas has to offer
unfold for these gentlemen. This genuine work of art has some much of
the high comedy that many of today&#x27;s comedy&#x27;s are missing, putting
ordinary people in extraordinary situations. But also including the
guilty pleasure that we all enjoy, the low comedy, especially Zach&#x27;s
hilarious performance and dialog. Actually, I am a firm believer that
this film will be a jump start for Galifianakis&#x27;s long career ahead.<br /><br />This won&#x27;t be one that will be forgotten anytime soon. You will find
yourself going right back to the theater to watch it again. Can&#x27;t wait
for The Hangover 2!!
