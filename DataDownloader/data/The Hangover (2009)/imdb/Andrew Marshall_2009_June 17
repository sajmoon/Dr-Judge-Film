I noticed that this movie was lingering in the Top 250 movies, so I
decided to take a look. The film is very much along the lines of a
Farrelly brothers movie and follows a Bachelor party in Las Vegas.
Three of the four middle aged guys wake up and have no recall what
happened the night before. They have lost the groom and they need to
try to piece together what happened during the previous night. The
humour in the movie is very base, but the story does zip along. I found
a couple of the visual jokes very funny and it was very light-hearted
throughout. I probably will not remember a thing about it in a few
months, but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It seems
the director Todd Phillips will provide competition for the Farrelly&#x27;s
in the future.
