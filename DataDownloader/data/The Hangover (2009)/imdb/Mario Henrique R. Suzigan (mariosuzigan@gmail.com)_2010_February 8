This is an original comedy with the oldest characters of the last 20
years in comedy movies. <br /><br />The originality of this plot is in the way how the story is told and
how each character has a role in it. <br /><br />The story is based on a stag party in Las Vegas: we have the fianc&#xE9;,
the crazy fianc&#xE9;e&#x27;s brother, the best fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s friend and the fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s
friend who is already marriage. OK, until here there is a lot of movies
with the same premise, except by the way how the story will be told.
That is the differential of this movie and what makes it so cleaver and
funny.<br /><br />The story starts after a crazy night, which the spectators don&#x27;t know
what happened, all the characters wake up and realize the fianc&#xE9; is
missing and that no one have memories of the last nigh. How will they
discover what happened is the key of your entertainment!<br /><br />Trust me, I&#x27;m sure you will laugh until the end of the movie, as I am
sure this movie is destiny to be a classic in American comedy
