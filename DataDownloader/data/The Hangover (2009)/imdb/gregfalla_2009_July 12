With writers churning out script after mundane script; and story lines
weaker than the state of some actors after a hard night on the town:-
this film is exactly what those who have a hangover need; a breath of
fresh air. This is the funniest film of the decade. Compare it to the
likes of Yes Man which has Jim Carrey to carry the story but this
script calls upon actors of lesser known fame- and it does the script
and film more justice than having a well known cast member (I am not
criticising Yes Man either by the way!). The laughs are sustained
throughout and you are able to explore &#x27;The Night Before The Morning
After&#x27;. We have all been there, but it has never been this amusing.
Even calling upon physical attributes of the actors for jokes; i.e.
weight or facial hair allow this script to have more depth than modern
day thrillers. A true classic is born in the shape of the Hangover.
