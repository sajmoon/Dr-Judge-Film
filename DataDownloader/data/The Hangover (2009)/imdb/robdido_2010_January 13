Not since 1984&#x27;s Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks has a good old bachelor
movie come along like &#x27;The Hangover&#x27;. Doug (Justin Bartha) is getting
married and heads to Vegas for a low key bachelor party with mates Phil
(Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis aka. Fat
Jesus).<br /><br />The night doesn&#x27;t turn out as planned and they wake to find their hotel
room trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and the
groom missing. With no memory of what happened the rest of the movie is
a hilarious trek through Vegas trying to put the pieces together.<br /><br />There are no big name comedians, instead a chemistry that develops
quickly between the guys which makes the comedy work, especially from
Zach Galifianakis who really shines. Heather Graham is as hot as usual,
and Mike Tyson has a cameo which is the only part I didn&#x27;t like. A lot
of improvisation can be felt through out the whole film and there are
some great photo&#x27;s at the end credits that looked like they really did
go on a wild night in Vegas.
