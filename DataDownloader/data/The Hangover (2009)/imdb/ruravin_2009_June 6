Absolutely loved this movie. The theatre was all laughs through the
whole movie. Don&#x27;t go expecting a cinematic masterpiece but if you are
looking for out of control laughter this is your flick. The story was
funny the acting was hilarious and I don&#x27;t want to spoil it but the end
was so funny my wife hurt her ribs (no I&#x27;m not kidding) from laughing
so hard. <br /><br />I am going back to see this movie again. And I don&#x27;t do that often, but
for any guy with a sense of humour or has ever been to a bachelor party
(or can&#x27;t wait to go to a rockin&#x27; bachelor party) this is a must see
movie.
