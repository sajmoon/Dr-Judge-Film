Just before his wedding, a man and his three friends go to Vegas, a
land of adventure where anything can happen. And in this movie,
anything does happen. You&#x27;ll never believe so much can go so wrong in
such a short time. How will the friends be able to recover from such a
seemingly disastrous night? <br /><br />I had heard some positive buzz on &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; from a variety of
people, and figured why not watch it? And I will say that while I&#x27;m
glad I did, it&#x27;s not quite on a par with other comedies, despite
several humorous and outrageous moments. The first twenty minutes is a
bit slow, and although it quickly recovers, I just didn&#x27;t end up
feeling as entertained as I had hoped when it was all over. Maybe the
characters weren&#x27;t lovable or something... I don&#x27;t know. I see this
film&#x27;s popularity declining in a year or two. I&#x27;d much rather watch
&#x22;Slackers&#x22;.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The cop car bit is hilarious, the Asian guy from
&#x22;Community&#x22; is pretty cool, and the tiger... well, there&#x27;s a tiger! In
fact, my favorite part is Ed Helms&#x27; song about the tiger (sometimes
referred to as &#x22;Tiger Snooze&#x22;, though the actual title is unknown to
me). Oh, and a Holocaust ring. My biggest complaint is Heather Graham.
While she does fine, I just never cared for Graham and I heard that the
part was offered to Lindsay Lohan. I much prefer Lohan, and it&#x27;s a part
that could have helped her collapsing career. Oh well.<br /><br />If you like &#x22;Old School&#x22; and &#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22;, this is probably your
sort of film. I don&#x27;t mind those, but it&#x27;s not really my favorite. And
this isn&#x27;t exactly the same -- it&#x27;s not Will Ferrell, it&#x27;s not Judd
Apatow. But, the trend in comedies these days is going in a direction I
don&#x27;t necessarily appreciate as others do. I can&#x27;t pinpoint it.
