I saw this movie in theaters twice in the first week that it came out.
Unlike most of the R-rated comedies released recently it has some
sexual jokes, but never gets completely raunchy. Everybody in this
movie did a great job, Bradley Cooper has been one of my favorite
actors, since I first saw him in Wedding Crashers with Owen Wilson and
Vince Vaughn. He was hilarious in The Hangover. The Hangover is
definitely not like Judd Apatow movies, which should be kept far out of
the reach of kids under 13, it is a movie for the whole family to
enjoy, and will make a great gift for anyone of any age. All in all
this was a pleasant surprise, and I hope to be seeing it winning many
awards in the near future.
