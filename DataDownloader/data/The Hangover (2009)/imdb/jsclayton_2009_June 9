2009_June 9 
You know I thought it would be hard to top the comic lineup of films
that we had in 08&#x27;. Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers,
Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Role Models. Last year was a good comedy
year. Until 12:01 A. M. June 5th, 2009.<br /><br />The Hangover has got to be the funniest film I have ever seen. The
characters have great development and fall wonderfully into their
situation. If you haven&#x27;t seen the preview here&#x27;s a synopsis: Guy&#x27;s go
to Vegas for bachelor party, they get messed up, spend the rest of
movie looking for the groom they lost the night before. Bradley Cooper
was the perfect choice for the leader of the bozos about in Las Vegas.
Ed Helms is perfect as the doctor with the horrible girlfriend (Also
played very convincingly by Rachel Harris) and the uptight but loose at
the same time attitude. ALAN is the off the wall comic relief in this
equation and has some of the most memorable lines in the film. The
soundtrack is also great and goes well with this film.<br /><br />This is truly the funniest movie in a long time that I have seen.<br /><br />Go Watch AS Soon AS Possible
