I just had to comment because I think people are a little out of hand
on this movie. I am a big fan of comedies, and usually make it to most
of the big ones in theaters. I heard a lot of hype before going to see
it, left the movie with a smile on my face, but my sides and cheeks
didn&#x27;t hurt. Thats how you can tell if a movie is really funny.
Comparing it to recent comedies to come out I would rate it below the
likes of Tropic Thunder, Pinapple Express, Borat, Superbad, 40 Year Old
Virgin. It was probably on par with Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah
Marshall, Knocked Up (also overrated), etc. It was a solid, good funny
movie, but has no business being on the top 250 list, and being one of
the top comedies of all time (according to the list). There were
laughs, but I never found myself sucking for air or bending over cause
my sides hurt, which I did for the previously mentioned movies. <br /><br />6/10
