I just saw the Hangover yesterday and I must say that it is definitely
one of the top funniest movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. I had heard many great
things about it and how hilarious it was so naturally, I had big
expectations. This movie went above and beyond those expectations.
There are only a select few times that a movie has made me actually
laugh out loud multiple times. The Hangover had me laughing out loud
every minute. Literally, there is something funny every minute of the
movie. The situations and characters are all so absurd that you can&#x27;t
help but laugh at that alone. I loved every bit of the movie because it
just catches your complete attention for 2 hours. The makers of this
movie are comedic geniuses for creating this movie and fulfilling what
every comedy movie wants to do: create a laugh a minute. This is an
awesome movie and I recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh.
Trust me, you will love the Hangover!
