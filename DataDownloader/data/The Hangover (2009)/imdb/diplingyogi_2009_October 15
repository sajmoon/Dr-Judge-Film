If you&#x27;ve liked Very Bad Things you will definitively not like this
movie. &#x27;Hangover&#x27; seems like a bad copy of that film.<br /><br />This film was recommended by a friend of mine, saying he &#x22;laughed his
way through the whole film&#x22;. I assume that his humor tastes are more
middle-of-the-roadish or maybe he had a similar experience in Vegas, so
he could connect to the ridiculous events on screen. I think, I laughed
twice.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think this film should be in the top 2000 (lest alone in the
top 250). There must be something very wrong with the rating system on
IMDb.<br /><br />If you choose your movies based on ratings on IMDb, make an exception
for this one. Rather re-watch Very Bad Things or Fear and Loathing.
