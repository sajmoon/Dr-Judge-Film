I went and watched this movie last night at the drive in along with the
new terminator movie, i went to basically see terminator and this was
playing along side of TS. I liked this movie more than i did
Terminator.<br /><br />When it first started i thought it was going to be a stupid comedy, but
i found myself laughing at quite a few different scenes.<br /><br />The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the Pedophile jokes, and the director
should be ashamed for trying to find humor in adults having sex with
minors.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a fun film, i give it 5 stars out of 10
