I watched &#x27; The Hangover&#x27; today after hearing recomendations from
friends. Twenty minutes into the film I couldn&#x27;t understand why I
wasn&#x27;t laughing. I am no prude and have found comedies such as &#x27;Knocked
Up&#x27; hilarious. However the clich&#xE9;d storyline and frat house &#x27;jokes&#x27;
took it&#x27;s toll on me. I found the humour that they used with the baby
crossed a line. It is fine to use vulgar humour if the jokes are
intelligent and well thought out. The makers of South Park posses this
skill, unfortunately the makers of &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; lacked the skills to
do this. Instead relying on clich&#xE9;d frat boy humour appealing to the
lowest common denominator.
