Slightly concerning time for me to go and see this film as my brother
was in Hungary on his stag do at the time but this didn&#x27;t stop me
rolling in the aisles.<br /><br />Set in Vegas this tells the story of Doug (Bartha) embarking on his
stag night with his 2 best friends - cool teacher Phil (Cooper) and
geeky Doctor/Dentist Stu (Helms) and his soon to be &#x27;weird&#x27; brother in
law Alan (Galifianakis ). They head out for a night they will never
forget and it turns out they do just that.<br /><br />They wake up the next morning with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in
the cupboard and a missing Groom. The hilarity ensues as they retrace
the previous night&#x27;s steps in a bid to get Doug back in time for his
wedding. Cue shot gun weddings, camp Asian gangsters, plenty of
gambling and of course Mike Tyson.<br /><br />Where the film lacks in recognisable faces it certainly makes up for in
humour and suspense. The story is uncomplicated but keeps you on the
edge of your seat as the plot thickens. With all that it has to offer
it&#x27;s little wonder they didn&#x27;t feel the need to use an all star cast.
For me Zach Galifianakis is the star of the show with his character&#x27;s
lack of social grace and weird dress sense.<br /><br />I fully recommend seeing this film with a crowd.
