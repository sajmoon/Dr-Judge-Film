Todd Phillips, the writer/director of Road Trip, Old School, and
Starsky &#x26; Hutch, brings us another rowdy trip through manhood with The
Hangover. We follow Doug (Justin Bartha), his best friends Phil
(Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), as well as Alan (Zach
Galifianakis), Doug&#x27;s future brother in-law, who plan on making Doug&#x27;s
bachelor party one to remember. It&#x27;s certainly memorable, but not the
night itself.<br /><br />The morning after Phil, Stu, and Alan find themselves back in their
hotel suite with very little clothing, a chicken, a baby, a missing
tooth, and no Doug. Oh, and their is a tiger in the bathroom. The three
set out in search for the missing groom who has a day to be back in
L.A. in less than two days for his wedding. They take the baby, shake
off their hangovers, and hit the strip looking for clues that lead them
to the hospital, a wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson&#x27;s house.<br /><br />The story is as ridiculous as it sounds, but I was still completely
engrossed in what was going on. I couldn&#x27;t believe how messed up their
night was, yet I was completely focused on what would happen next. It&#x27;s
the kind of film where from the start you just accept that crazy things
are going to happen and you just enjoy the ride.<br /><br />The three leads, Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis could not have been
better choices. Cooper has the looks and charisma to handle his &#x22;too
cool&#x22; character. Helms, more commonly known as Andy Bernard on NBC&#x27;s
&#x22;The Office&#x22;, is perfect as the nice guy with a mean streak (and
missing tooth). Galifianakis could not have made me laugh any more than
I did. His looks alone let you know you can&#x27;t take him seriously. He is
pudgy, childish, and completely engrossed in his character. <br /><br />Unlike some filmmakers who make similar films, Phillips has not fallen
off his game. He didn&#x27;t get lazy and go through the motions. Each
scene, each line, and each set up follow through in their delivery and
add to the flow of the film. There were times when the action might get
a little too serious, but he brings us back from reality and throws a
one liner or situation you can&#x27;t help but laugh at. It&#x27;s so enjoyable.<br /><br />I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect coming into this film and I sure am
pleased with the results. I didn&#x27;t anticipate liking The Hangover as
much as I did and it is probably going to be one of the best films I
will see this summer. If you are of age and are in need of a good
laugh, go see this. I take that back. If you are of age go see it
anyways. It&#x27;s worth the price of admission and then some.
