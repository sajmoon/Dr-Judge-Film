STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />There&#x27;s lots of places I&#x27;d like to visit in America, with it&#x27;s fifty
one states and stapling as the most powerful country in the world. But
Las Vegas, to be honest, has always stood out as one I could quite
comfortably avoid. The emphasis to me has always seemed to be on the
casinos, and I&#x27;ve never gambled in my life (well, I&#x27;ve brought the odd
lottery ticket.) But of course, there&#x27;s also plenty of super hotels,
nightclubs, world class shows...the place would seem to have something
for everyone. But, from the sweeping over shots on the opening of The
Hangover, my main problem with it now is that it all looks too over
whelming to me, with bursting visual stimuli coming from every pore.
&#x22;Designed to inflame the senses&#x22; as Ned Flanders well described it in
an episode of The Simpsons. &#x22;A place where it&#x27;s against the law to be
responsible&#x22; as Piers Morgan more worryingly described it in a recent
newspaper article for the Mail. Aya Napa and Ibiza are wild enough for
me, but if you had the time and the money, just how out of control
would things be if you had your stag night in Vegas? There&#x27;s people in
the world that could do that, and that&#x27;s the high concept idea of this
film.<br /><br />How wild it gets is that the groom Doug (Justin Bertha) goes
missing...that&#x27;s without mentioning a trashed hotel room, a tiger in
the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a stolen cop car and the naked
Chinese man (who turns out to be a camp Triad boss!) who jumps out the
boot. Somehow smooth Phil (Bradley Cooper), charmless Alan (Zach
Galifianakis) and meek Stu (Ed Helms) must make sense of it all while
searching for their friend who&#x27;s getting married in less than twenty
four hours. It&#x27;s such a simple but effective idea that probably works
so well because of it&#x27;s what if?...potential. Men together are laddish
and egg each other on, and just how out of control could things be and
just what would the consequences be? Of course a lot of the humour is
facile and over the top, but it works well with the tone of the film in
that&#x27;s the mindset of the men involved and quite often the film is pant
wettingly hilarious.<br /><br />The director (who luckily has a string of well known credits behind
him) has taken a cast of unknowns and produced a highly successful high
concept comedy that&#x27;s inspired and original and like the best of them
nowadays, about as politically correct as a drunken Roy &#x27;Chubby&#x27; Brown.
As such, it&#x27;s definitely one of the better comedies of recent times.
