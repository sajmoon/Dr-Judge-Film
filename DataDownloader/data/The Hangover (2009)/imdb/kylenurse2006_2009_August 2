This is quite easily, the funniest film I have seen this year! I
watched Bruno a few week s before this film, and in my opinion, The
Hangover, is 10 times better! Borat is also better than Bruno, but The
Hangover is much better than Borat! If you haven&#x27;t watched this film,
go and watch it! I have watched this film twice already, and I am
surely going to buy this on DVD when it comes out! This film also
contains a great cast of characters with great actors and actresses. I
love this movie so much, because it made me laugh in almost every
sentence in the film, but not just because of the jokes, and the things
they were saying, the great acting, and the way they were saying it,
and how they looked when the actors said it.
