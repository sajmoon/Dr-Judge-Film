Apparently so.<br /><br />This movie, like many other new &#x22;comedies&#x22; contains nothing but vulgar,
offensive humor, the kind of humor that you feel guilty at laughing at.
If you enjoy obscenities being shouted every three seconds, vulgar
jokes, and shock laughs then this movie is right for you. However if
you are looking for a comedy that has structure, and real humor that
won&#x27;t make you feel dirty, then look somewhere else. I could honestly
stare at a wall and laugh harder than when I did watching this movie.<br /><br />Now I won&#x27;t just denounce this movie all the way. It did have an
original storyline: Three guys trying to find their friend after a
crazy night of partying. And their were some &#x22;funny&#x22; parts in this
movie that didn&#x27;t involve vulgarity. But as far as movies go, this is
just your typical obscene comedy that lacks real humor. But hey, if it
sells, that&#x27;s all that matters to the writers.
