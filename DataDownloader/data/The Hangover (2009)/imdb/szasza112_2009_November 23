I &#x27;m happy that this film is out of top 250. The top 250 is reserve for
best films ever, not movie like this. Is it funny? Yes? Then please
watch really funny movies like: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060123/
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072431/
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054068/ and after I&#x27;d like to read your
comments! I&#x27;ve watched it last night and this film is not 8 but only 6
(but rather 4) points. What are the punch lines? A missing teeth? The
Chinese guy? The cop&#x27;s car? The tiger? Mike Tyson&#x27;s punch? The wedding?
Come on... So boring and so USA movie. Szasza, Hungary
