I got to The Hangover after everyone else had already seen it, told me
how brilliant it was, told me their favourite &#x22;bit&#x22; and told me to get
around to going to see it. Having been burnt many times before though,
I did not let this praise make me have any grand expectations and I
came to it just hoping that it would be funny. And it was. I had some
good laughs and plenty of chuckles throughout the film &#x96; enough to
enjoy it right through from the setup to the pictures over the end
credits. Whether I would be able to enjoy it for a second viewing
though I&#x27;m not so sure.<br /><br />The reason for this is that many of the laughs came from the sudden
nature of the comedy &#x96; whether it be a sudden physical act or the
unexpected nature of a line. It is a slightly childish type of comedy
with lots of people getting hurt in funny ways and this only has so
much of an appeal to me. Like the Oriental gambler says, &#x22;it&#x27;s funny
because he&#x27;s fat&#x22; and that does rather sum up why some of the film is
funny. This is not to take away from some of the very funny lines and
scenarios that the film comes up with, but I still did think that the
majority of my laughs would be dissipated if I had known what was
coming (as I would with a second viewing). The flow of the story works
a little bit against it as well. In some regards it has a good
&#x22;mystery&#x22; structure to it but then again the central concept means that
in too many scenes we have to listen to a character explain that they
have no memory etc etc. Fortunately it is mostly funny enough to cover
up this clunky repeated problem.<br /><br />The cast really help the comedy by their delivery. Although he is not
really that well known in the UK (The Office US not being a big show
here) Helms was the standout for me. In a character with elements of
his Andy in there, I found him very funny and with a great sense of
timing. Galifianakis is pretty good as well, although he has a simpler
character in many ways. Cooper is not quite as good with the comedy but
he is a good presence in the film and plays off the others
(particularly Helms) well. The various comic characters in support
include mostly funny turns from Graham, Jeong, Riggle and of course
Mike Tyson.<br /><br />In summary, The Hangover will be loved by the majority of the target
audience but is fast-paced and funny enough to please the casual
viewer. It may not stand up to repeat viewings due to the nature of
some of the laughs but it good fun without too much reliance on crudity
or basic pratfalls.
