About-to-be-wed Justin Bartha is accompanied by his three friends
(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) to Las Vegas for one
last breath of bachelor freedom. All hell breaks loose though after the
first night as Bartha is nowhere to be found and the trio of pals have
absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired. Would-be
comedic dynamo which starts off like a champion and then fades into
obscurity like a washed-up bench-warmer. The typical &#x22;Old School&#x22; and
&#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22;-styled comedy wears out its welcome as the zany
situations (a missing tooth, an abandoned baby, a loose tiger, a stolen
police car, the yakuza, and so on) come at you fast and furiously with
adult situations and sometimes downright vulgar outcomes being the
orders for the day. Lost in the mix is Bartha (just basically getting
lost in the shuffle early on) and usually dependable performers like
Heather Graham and Jeffrey Tambor who have little more than token
parts. Cameos by Mike Tyson and Mike Epps are unnecessary distractions
and the inclusion of sexually-confused Asian crime boss Ken Jeong
(seeing more of him than we want) are dizzying sidelines which
represent little rime, reason, and most importantly merit. Good for a
few laughs, but at an over-priced expense. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
