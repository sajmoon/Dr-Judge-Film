When Todd Phillips announced the viewing of his newest movie &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; my first instinct was to reject it immediately, because my
track record with this director hasn&#x27;t exactly been the best. Don&#x27;t get
me wrong, Todd has given us some exceptional stuff over the years.
&#x22;Road Trip&#x22; was a bit dodgy, but overall a funny movie, Old School
wasn&#x27;t too bad either, it did have it&#x27;s moments of enjoyment. But I
think the moment where Phillips really lost my respect was with his
2006 film &#x22;School for Scoundrels&#x22;, I can&#x27;t even begin to describe what
a bad movie that was.<br /><br />Anyway, my mind was set. I wasn&#x27;t going to set myself up for
disappointment again. However my friends would not give up until they
got me to sit down and watch this movie. At one point, I believe they
even threaten to tie me to a chair and tape my eyelids to my head and
make me watch it. Course I knew they were bluffing, but I wasn&#x27;t going
to take the risk. So that same weekend I finally I gave in and decided
to buy a ticket for &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, and with great surprise I came out
of the cinema cracking myself with laughter. It&#x27;s time&#x27;s like this I&#x27;m
glad that my friends are dangerously obsessive.<br /><br />The Hangover is a huge come back by Todd Phillips. It&#x27;s a breath of
fresh air that outwits most of the modern comedies you see now a days.
The title makes it pretty obvious that it&#x27;s about a group of blokes
that have one hell of a night and as a result suffer from hell of a
hangover, with one of its main symptoms being memory loss. After waking
up in a trashed apartment with one guy missing, the three friends make
their way to the streets of Las Vegas making several stops and
gradually putting together the pieces of the puzzle that will hopefully
solve the mystery of what happened at the bachelor party as well as
mark the location of the soon to be married groom.<br /><br />A great thing about this movie is that you don&#x27;t ever know what&#x27;s going
to happen. These guys just go from place to place with no idea of what
lies ahead, and that in itself leaves for a very funny effect.
Phillip&#x27;s is also very careful to make sure that he doesn&#x27;t expose too
much information about what happened that night, the supporting cast
only gives a limited bit of info to three main characters, so that way,
it doesn&#x27;t ruin the ending for the audience, as well as maintain the
hilarious effect of not being able to determine what kind of unexpected
occurrence will take place.<br /><br />Apart from it being genuinely funny, The Hangover also succeeds in
delivering an equal balance of character and crudity. Although they
appear somewhat stereotypical, Stu, Phil and Alan are all consistently
amusing figures. The chemistry between them is convincing, effectively
funny, and very well portrayed by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach
Galifianakis.<br /><br />With a clever script, efficient direction, and hilarious auto-play
between characters, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; makes for an overall considerably
funny movie about the modern concept of road trip to Las Vegas.
