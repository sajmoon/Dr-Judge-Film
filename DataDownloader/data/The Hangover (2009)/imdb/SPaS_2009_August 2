Where to begin? Guess I could start with the evolution of raunchy, R -
rated yet smart high-concept comedies where three - dimensional key
characters must deal with over - blown situations and charicatured
characters in modern - day America, learning lessons in life in the
end. These include such modern classics as American Pie, There&#x27;s
something about Mary and about a dozen examples by Judd Apatow and co.
in the last five years. However, this would be just tooting my own
horn, and since most of you have seen those movies, who gives a rat&#x27;s
a$$?<br /><br />So, here we have the latest inclusion: a comedy about three guys waking
up in a terrible hangover in Vegas, only to realize they have lost the
groom along with their memory in a barchelor party gone way out of the
map, and that they have only about 48 hours to find him and get to the
wedding. Directed by Todd Phillips, who also gave us &#x22;Road trip&#x22; (and
which I&#x27;ve always considered superior to &#x22;American pie&#x22; for the sake
that &#x22;RT&#x22; is just more laid-back).<br /><br />Unlike for example most of Apatow&#x27;s comedies, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is not
&#x22;smarter&#x22; than what the premise lets you in on. You can&#x27;t break it down
to analyze it, because it&#x27;s just what the one - line description says.
I guess the film-makers considered two choices: re-write it and force
it into the successful &#x22;Apatow&#x22; mold, or play it out like it is: like
an &#x22;eighties&#x22; comedy. They did the latter, and with that, the right
choice.<br /><br />The Hangover&#x27;s biggest assets are that it&#x27;s been crafted to the hilt on
all distinctive areas: - The characters. When you meet them at first,
you go like &#x22;ok, so they are not clear caricatures, but how could these
guys ever be friends?&#x22;. But, along the movie, you grow into accepting
them, with their pros and cons. You get to recognize their roles and
how they &#x22;complete a full circle&#x22; without it being too obvious from the
get-go. Huge plus.<br /><br />- The dialogue. Well, the usual Kevin Smith/Judd Apatow - stuff. Kind
of like &#x22;Friends&#x22; but with F - words and pop culture references. Good
stuff, though.<br /><br />- Plot. The whole thing plays out like a good mystery and gives a 100
minutes of laughs without missing one beat, losing pace or losing focus
(basically this is what &#x22;Dude, where&#x27;s my car&#x22;, SHOULD have been).
Let&#x27;s just repeat the thing that really struck me in &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;:
there are no lulls. This, I consider a defining strength: when one clue
has been solved, it moves straight into the next one. The &#x22;ok...what
now?&#x22; - bits have been surgically removed. Also, you will NOT check
your watch when the film moves from the second act to the third. Now
THIS is rare.<br /><br />Gotta hand it also to Phillips (whose best movie so far) and to the
cast - along with castING. Bold having this many new names in key
roles.<br /><br />8 out of 10 stars. Hope they won&#x27;t ruin this with the already green-lit
sequel.
