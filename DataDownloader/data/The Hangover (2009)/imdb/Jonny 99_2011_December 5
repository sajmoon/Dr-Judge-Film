Highly original mix of raunchy comedic, snappy dialogue and absurdist
situations. The Hangover is the comedy you always wondered why
Hollywood doesn&#x27;t make. The movie manages to combine the smarts and
observation of &#x22;Juno&#x22; with the absurdist situations of Marx brothers
movies and frames all of it in an R-rated Las Vegas romp. The
non-linear narrative structure makes for a re-watchable film that is
destined to be a cultural touchstone along the lines of &#x22;Stripes&#x22;,
&#x22;Better Off Dead&#x22; and the &#x22;Revenge of the Nerds&#x22; series. Best comedy
since &#x22;Tropic Thunder&#x22; although that was a better and more substantial
film.
