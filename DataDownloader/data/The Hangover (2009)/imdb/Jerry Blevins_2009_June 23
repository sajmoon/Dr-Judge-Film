This is a revised review of this movie. I originally gave it a 9, but
after the hype and rewatching this movie, my views have changed.
Afterall, the true test of a movie is time.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I loved this movie, the first time I saw it. But
unlike other comedies, Tommy Boy, Old School, Happy Gilmore, etc. this
movie doesn&#x27;t have replay value.<br /><br />The initial shock of the photos was epic for me in the theaters, but it
lost a lot of weight after knowing they were coming when I watched it
on DVD.<br /><br />Great 1st time watch. Below average 2nd.....
