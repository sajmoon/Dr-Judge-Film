&#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is undoubtedly one of the best mainstream comedies of
2009 so far. With that said, it&#x27;s important to remember that comedies
are rarely very funny, and especially American ones. And naming &#x27;The
Hangover&#x27; one of the best comedies of 2009, it&#x27;s also important for me
to say that I didn&#x27;t find it very funny, it was very entertaining and
joyous, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny; most of the gags or jokes
seemed somehow familiar, and the sketches drawn into the script were
occasionally misplaced (the Taser scene). With that said, the three
main performances does everything to this movie; Bradley Cooper as the
cocky alpha-male with a twist, Ed Helms as the pussy-whipped nerd and
Zach Galifianakis being somewhat of a baby inside a grown-up man, and
they were all great in their characters. The whole atmosphere of the
movie works greatly, like &#x22;what exactly happened last night?&#x22; and you
pulsate in the same manic rhythm as their Las Vegas trip simply goes
more and more terribly wrong. And after a 100 minutes of Las Vegas
meltdown it&#x27;s nice to see that the movie&#x27;s got a heart (Heather Graham
shines as a shattered stripper) and the end credits are greatly
provided with pictures from the night we never experienced.
