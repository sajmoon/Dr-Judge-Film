Let me start by saying that this film was the absolute funniest movie
of 2009. Director Todd Phillips has created comedic gold in this buddy
comedy about a bachelor party in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong
when the groom goes missing; now, his three friends must piece together
what happened over a night none of them remember to locate him in time
for his approaching wedding. Similar to DUDE, WHERE&#x27;S MY CAR but in a
more adult vein, it&#x27;s hilarious to watch the events unfold as the guys
find out just how insane their missing night was. I&#x27;d been excited to
see this movie when it came to theaters, having heard all the hype
building behind it and it lived up to all I&#x27;d read.<br /><br />The cast was phenomenal in this movie. The three main characters
(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) were hilarious,
especially the character of Alan (Galifianakis). Future brother-in-law
Alan was the requisite outcast character who&#x27;s slow-witted nature never
seems to fit with the cool Phil (Cooper) or the high-strung Stu
(Helms). Supporting the main trio are a slew of cameos as the guys
retrace their steps to find the truth. Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham,
Ken Jeong, and Mike Epps pop in for a few laughs and even Mike Tyson
has a few scenes where he&#x27;s surprisingly funny.<br /><br />There isn&#x27;t too much I can say about the film without risking dropping
spoilers, as the film is just as much a mystery as it is a comedy. The
film ranks as one of the funniest raunchy buddy comedies I&#x27;ve seen and
was a much appreciated surprise when I caught in in theaters. It&#x27;s an
intelligent comedy with the perfect level of immaturity and some great
performances, which should be enough to entertain anyone. Check it out
and be sure to sit through the first half of the end credits where they
show photos from the missing camera and shed some more light on the
most insane bachelor party.
