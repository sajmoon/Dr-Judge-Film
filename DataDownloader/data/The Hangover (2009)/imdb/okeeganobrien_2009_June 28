Funny stuff. To be honest I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of &#x22;Old School&#x22; or
&#x22;RoadTrip&#x22;. I thought both film were overrated. But after seeing this
i&#x27;m now a Todd Phillips follower! The movie has a very simple plot
line. Four guys go to Vegas as a bachelor party and wake up hungover.
The thing that I liked about this movie that really had nothing to do
with how funny it was, was that it was well made. Some comedies have
horrible lighting and visuals and only focus on the jokes. But this
movie looks great, sounds great and was edited fantastically. Having
said that, it was naturally funny. It didn&#x27;t feel forced at all and and
there was no political agenda behind it unlike shows like Family Guy
and movies like Harlod and Kumar. Overall this movie was one of the
funniest, well done comedies I have ever seen. Everyone in the cinema
was laughing and having a great time. If you like to laugh, which
everyone should, you will love this film.
