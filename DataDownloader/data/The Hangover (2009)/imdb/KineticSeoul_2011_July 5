This was the biggest comedy for 2009 and for the most part it deserves
all the hype it got. It was ballsy and had some hysterical moments and
kept me entertained and amused all the way through. This comedy was
such a big hit that it even made few of the actors in this get more
roles and stand out even more in other movies they will be featured in
later. Especially Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, also even Ken
Jeong. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand tries a bit too hard after
this flick though, he was good in this movie though. To sum it up this
movie is a instant classic comedy that will be remembered for a while
even after you finish watching. This movie had just about all the right
comedic element to the point it&#x27;s most definitely worth seeing if you
like comedies. Yes, some of the jokes might be a bit crude for some
audiences. But aren&#x27;t all comedies now a days trying to push the bar? I
personally liked the shock factor in this, this movie is a 8.6/10 for
me.<br /><br />8.6/10
