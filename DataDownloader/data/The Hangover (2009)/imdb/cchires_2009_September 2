The Hangover is summer&#x27;s best film! I won&#x27;t go into details about the
funny parts because if you are one of the few people who still haven&#x27;t
seen it, words just won&#x27;t do this film justice. I will, however, give
kudos to those involved in making this movie.<br /><br />Primarily, the film works as a result of a brilliant narrative device:
we are just as clueless as the characters are about what happened the
night before. As the film progresses, we are given one shocking
revelation after another, each building to high comedy. The momentum is
almost non-stop! <br /><br />A lot of the humor is also generated from the corky characters and how
they react to each shocking development. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and
Zach Galifianakis all turn in brilliant performances and stay in
character rather than just acting goofy. The fact that they all seem so
believable makes the chaos that they face all the more hysterical.<br /><br />Laughter is valuable to your health and it is hard to produce an
effective comedy these days. Anyone who needs to laugh is well served
by seeing this movie; even if you don&#x27;t need a laugh: see this movie!!
