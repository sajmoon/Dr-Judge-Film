The Hangover is one of those movies that could have really been
something special, if the pieces were placed together well. The plot
was engaging, the acting was great, the pacing was perfect, and the
premise itself is something unique and overall a win-win scenario. What
was left? The content within the plot. The right blend of humor and
comical suspense could elevate this to one of the comedic greats of
recent decades. But, they just missed the mark, barely missed the mark.
Oh, but it was so close. The Hangover is an excellent story about
escapades and mayhem in Vegas and their consequences, but gets hindered
because of the overload of crude humor, softer second act, and an
under-written character that wasn&#x27;t funny at all. Despite these
setbacks, The Hangover is worthy of a viewing, especially if you
enjoyed Todd Phillips&#x27; brand of crude adult humor.<br /><br />In the surprise-sleeper hit of the summer, we follow two good friends
of the groom and the bride&#x27;s brother taking the groom to Vegas for a
bachelor party before the wedding. All of a sudden, it is morning,
three of the four wakes up to a disastrous room; and a random baby
nearby. Oh and there&#x27;s a chicken and a tiger in the hotel room as well.
One is missing a tooth, the other has scratches everywhere, and one is
missing pants. The groom is missing. The rest of the movie is spent
picking up clues as to what happened, how it happened, and where on
earth the groom went. The setup is crazy, and the events that unfolded
the evening before was just as crazy. This is a sort of script the
mainstream hasn&#x27;t experienced in quite some time. The movie becomes
mostly comedy, but with hints of mystery as well.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is most definitely the screenplay, which was
molded well by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Instead of a Ferrell or
Apatow production which creates a situation and improvisation fills in
the gaps, The Hangover relies strictly on plot and what twists and
turns are thrown to our main characters. The hangover peeps encounter
an angry Mike Tyson, disgruntled cops, gangsters, and much more in the
span of 48 hours that follow the mysteriously drunken evening. This is
the first raunchy comedy script I&#x27;ve seen that deserves at least an
Oscar nod for its creativity since The 40-Year-Old Virgin several years
ago.<br /><br />Of course, it&#x27;s the premise that sold the tickets, since virtually
nobody knew who was actually in the film. Nonetheless, Bradley Cooper
and Ed Helms steal the show with their outstanding performances as the
frontrunners in the chase for the truth of the previous evening and the
groom. Everyone else (even Mike Tyson) does a respectable job, with the
exception of one. Zach Galifianakis&#x27; role as the screw-loose brother of
the bride just falls flat most of the time. His character comes cross
as a mix of a pedophile, a druggie, and Brick from Anchorman (in terms
of the random statements and questions). This mix fails because Steve
Carell perfected the dimwit role as Brick, and there virtually no
consistency with Alan&#x27;s character. He is the one role that was not
fleshed out.<br /><br />Your other drawback is the amount of crude humor. Crude humor is best
in small doses (see: Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Dumb and Dumber,
40-Year-Old Virgin). In The Hangover, it&#x27;s a bit overblown, and
sometimes is used to try to save a scene. Todd Phillips improved upon
his pacing abilities and good shots of Las Vegas, but still relies too
much on crude humor and not enough on other ways to make the audience
laugh. The tale didn&#x27;t need the gross comedy, and would have been a
great production altogether if they had toned down on the nastiness.
The final scene makes you want to cringe almost.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Not as funny as everyone is making it out to be, but it&#x27;s
still a hilarious movie full of unpredictable moments and insanity.
This sleeper hit proves you don&#x27;t need big stars to make money; just
deliver a premise too fun to pass up. The writing is superb, the acting
(for the most part) is great, and the surprises keep you engaged with
what is going on. If you can get past the crude, then you&#x27;ll find a gem
that&#x27;s a few polishes away from truly shining among the greats.
Instead, it settles for Phillips&#x27; best film since Old School, and one
of the funniest raunch fests of the decade.
