Because I&#x27;ve never drank alcohol a day in my life, or don&#x27;t know what
it&#x27;s like to be a drunk, I didn&#x27;t think this movie would appeal to me,
at least in terms of entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised by how
much I liked it. I can&#x27;t say there are any big laughs, but I smiled a
lot, and didn&#x27;t feel like I was enduring these characters, rather than
enjoying what they were doing. I do think a lot of critics are gave
this movie too much credit. I can&#x27;t see how this is great, rather than
merely good. Another thing: The night before the hangover, these guys
sure don&#x27;t do a lot of drinking. I&#x27;m thinking to myself: &#x22;Small
glasses? That&#x27;s it?&#x22; I expected to see something more along the lines
of, say, a lot of drinking at some party. Still, the movie never lets
up, and that&#x27;s enough to recommend it.<br /><br />*** out of ****
