The Hangover follows three amnesiac groomsman the day after a bachelor
party as they track down the origins of a series of clues that they
hope lead them to the lost groom, Doug (Justin Bartha). The main
attraction for this movie was Mike Tyson&#x27;s cameo role and i didn&#x27;t
expect much from this movie; Zach Galifianakis character (Alan Garner)
was the best part of the film for me. overall i feel this is a
furiously paced and inventive take on a tried-and-tested formula. An
exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn&#x27;t sacrifice heart in pursuit of
laughs. This movie is not an all time great comedy, However if you have
spare time you should check it out.
