The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little
about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in
my reviews. If the movie sucks then I&#x27;m not shy about including details
and/or spoilers.<br /><br />Is it me or do you think the Hangover was overrated? I mean the
Hangover seemed overrated as hell. All the funny parts to the Hangover
can be found in the trailer. Hangover was so unfunny that I didn&#x27;t
waste a dime on the sequel. As for Hall Pass.. HOLY HELL, it is funny
as.. almost as funny as Old School. Laugh out Loud funny. It is
everything that the Hangover should/could have been. If you like off
the wall and sick and twisted humor then you&#x27;ll love this movie. They
better make a sequel to this beast of a movie. Hall Pass is what the
Hangover should have been... actually funny.<br /><br />The Hangover is a bit of a mystery to me in that I am confused why
people liked it so much. I personally know one person that thought this
movie was great however he happened to be a 16 year old kid that never
seen Superbad or Old School. Why did Hollywood overhype this boring ass
comedy? Maybe Vagus paid them? Who knows.
