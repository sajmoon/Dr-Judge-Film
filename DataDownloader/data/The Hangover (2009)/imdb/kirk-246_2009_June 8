Oh,I think I remember.I went to see this movie with my friend,who
wanted to see it more than I did.I just recently went to the movies to
see it last night,and this movie has a resemblance,only that the
characters don&#x27;t remember anything and I do.Is this movie
funny?Sometimes,but not gut-busting funny.Is it worth
watching?Definitely.This is a raunchy comedy with an interesting
plot,gross out humor,interesting characters,and Mike Tyson.Yep.<br /><br />4 friends are looking for the time of their lives.One is getting
married,as for the rest....I&#x27;m guessing that they wanted to go.Along
the way,they go to Las Vegas and get an expensive hotel room only to
get trashed in the morning to leave the guys wondering what
happened.One of the characters,who is a dentist,finds out that he&#x27;s
missing a tooth.What a night they must have had!<br /><br />B+
