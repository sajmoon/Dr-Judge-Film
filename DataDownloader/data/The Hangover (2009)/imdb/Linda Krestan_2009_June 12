I am not a frequent commenter. Whenever I comment on a film, it means I
have fallen in love with it. It is exactly this situation that I now
find myself in - I am in love with this brilliant comedy! There is not
a single dull moment in this film. There isn&#x27;t a single scene that
bores you, so even when serious sentences are muttered, you can be
certain that a glorious joke is soon to come. The characters are
beautifully unique and perfectly created...they each have their own
personality, therefore they all have different humor, and that is what
makes a great, great, GREAT comedy.<br /><br />And the ending is...well...LEGENDARY.<br /><br />Go see this film, even if you&#x27;re broke and will not have money left for
a diminutive piece of bread! Trust me on this.
