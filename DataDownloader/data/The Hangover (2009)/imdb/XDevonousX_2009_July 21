Wow. I was completely shocked. Let me start by saying that reviews for
this have perhaps been...fantasies. Complete fabrication. To see this
movie and enjoy it you must do two things: A. Be between the ages of 9
and 14. and B. Watch &#x22;Dude Where&#x27;s My Car?&#x22; instead. The Hangover is
overstuffed with Hollywood comedy convention to the point where I&#x27;m
sure it will make a couple crafty movie executives a whole lot of
money. I swear I have seen every scene in this movie in different
movies(different in that they are funny). If you think you&#x27;re smart,
and you want to get a big cheap ego-boost from guessing everything
that&#x27;s about to happen in a movie, by all means have a ball. But I
WANTED to enjoy this. I took my mother to this movie on her birthday.
Sure, she loves a good blow-job joke. But she can&#x27;t even look me in the
eyes after I actually paid for this.<br /><br />I was laughing here and there (at Zach Galafianakis, without whom I
would have stabbed someone). The actors were doing funny things, sure,
but those were mercilessly edited into absolute garbage-pile
stink-machine nothing. I LIKED Old School. I Loved Superbad. I like a
lot of popular Hollywood movies. I&#x27;m not a snob, even if I sound like
one. I am just so full of FURY that there are real people in my
hometown who will applaud when something like this occurs in front of
their eyes. I hope I&#x27;m not being too critical. (I&#x27;m not)
