Wow, this is just the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything failed
and I did not even smile once. It was so full of clich&#xE9;s, bad actors
and over-the-top BS that I was tempted to exit the cinema, for the
first time in my life. I would have if I didn&#x27;t go there with friends.<br /><br />It&#x27;s predictable, boring and a complete waste of time. The actors
overact almost every scene and some of them are embarrassing to watch.
I particularly disliked the guy who was always being an asshole towards
the others as he seemed to be a complete douche and a waste of air. The
guy named Alan was overacting in a way that is hard to describe. The
one with glasses was boring and dull and the last one we didn&#x27;t really
see that much, which I am grateful for.<br /><br />This is just dick-humor, and a bad attempt at that even. This movie is
a waste of money and everybody involved deserves some sort of torture
directed towards their lower region.<br /><br />I am in shock. Even things like Epic Movie is better than this.
