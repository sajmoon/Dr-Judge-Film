One of the best comedies i&#x27;ve ever seen. Just funnier than superbad
movie. Zach Galifianakis is incredible in this movie.<br /><br />If you want to laugh a lot watch it now!!!! I don&#x27;t understand what is
wrong with some people. Really, who gives one for this movie must have
some serious mental disease or something.<br /><br />You that like to read reviews before watching the movies, DON&#x27;T Believe
IN THE PEOPLE THAT HATED THIS MOVIE, it&#x27;s really a masterpiece, and
probably one of the funniest movies ever made.<br /><br />if you didn&#x27;t watch it yet run and watch it...<br /><br />THAT&#x27;S CLASSIC!!!!!
