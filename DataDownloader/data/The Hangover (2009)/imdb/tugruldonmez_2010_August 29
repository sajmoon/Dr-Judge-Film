well, i really expected much from this movie after all the awards
received but i was really very disappointed....it tried too hard to be
funny and this wasn&#x27;t funny....in fact it was like a drama movie in
which people had terrible things happened to them and one was lost....<br /><br />i began watching this movie with open mind and i was prepared to laugh
at any given moment but no, it didn&#x27;t work for me...i thought maybe it
was me not getting the comedy but i was relieved after seeing all those
negative reviews , at least there are still some people who could
really say it sucked!!!<br /><br />if you want a good laugh watch - very bad things- instead....
