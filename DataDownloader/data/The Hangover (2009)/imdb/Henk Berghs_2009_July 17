Lately after being disappointed a lot by trusting IMDb ratings and
comments too much and to discover that actual movie is total crap, I
know for sure that the movie industry itself hires people to comment
positively on movies. People who give this movie a 10 on 10, come on.
Or I should be worried by society at this point laughing at people
getting shot, kicked or otherwise molested or this a totally
manipulated rating. I suspect my last suggestion, and according to the
normal reviews I have read I am not the only one. This movie is not
funny, the only laugh I could bring up is a laugh about how idiotically
NOT funny this movie is, while being categorized as funny. This has
been the last time I trust IMDb ratings. Marketing oriented thinking
makes it&#x27;s logic that the movie industry itself manipulates ratings
whilst this is a powerful tool to promote a movie. I will however give
movies now a chance with a bad rating, because i suspect this indicates
only that the movie producers are not s desperate to manipulate the
movie&#x27;s rating. IMDb IS TURNED INTO A TOTAL FAKE!!!
