&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is what a comedy should be without being a bad movie.
All the ingredients of a good movie in general exist here and the film
is just so, so funny...and funny consistently. There aren&#x27;t huge laughs
followed by gaps of plot explanation or catch up or whatever. The plot
is essentially the comedy driven ingeniously by the actors. There are
almost no spots in the movie where you aren&#x27;t laughing...and if and
when you aren&#x27;t laughing you are only listening closely and
anticipating the next laugh and you never worry if the bulk of the
comedy is over. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn&#x27;t need Judd
Apatow and company to make it a good one. The Hangover leaves the
sophistication at the studio and just brings laughs - some crude, some
stupid, some witty, some dark, some insulting - but all worth seeing
this hilarious comedy.
