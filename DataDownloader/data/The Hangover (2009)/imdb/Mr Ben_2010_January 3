2010_January 3 
If you&#x27;re anything like my sister then the chances are, you will have
welcomed the New Year in a drunken stupor and welcomed the next
mornings sunshine with the sort of language that would make sailors
blush. To be honest, I&#x27;ve been milking it a touch and have been
reminding her of slurred voice-mail messages and drunken dialling that
has long since evaporated from her memory. However, I doubt her
experiences matched the events of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; which is a late
contender for being not just the best comedy of 2009 but possibly the
best film PERIOD of 2009. It&#x27;s certainly the most fun I&#x27;ve had watching
a movie since I caught &#x22;The Incredibles&#x22; at the cinema and unlike most
US comedies at the moment, had both myself and my Better Half in fits
of laughter.<br /><br />Two days before his impending wedding, Doug (Justin Bartha) takes his
two buddies Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) along for the
bachelor party of a lifetime in Las Vegas, together with his future
brother-in-law Alan (the very funny Zach Galifianakis). Once they&#x27;ve
checked into their suite and downed a couple of shots, they&#x27;re ready to
party. However, we next see them the morning after and there are a
couple of things that need addressing. For starters, there is a tiger
in their bathroom. Then there&#x27;s the delicate matter of the baby in the
closet. Stu is missing a tooth, Alan is missing his clothes from the
waist down and Doug is missing altogether. Between them, they must
retrace their steps to find Doug which isn&#x27;t easy when you can&#x27;t
remember anything...<br /><br />It&#x27;s difficult to imagine any comic potential being missed from such a
simple premise and yet &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; leaves no stone unturned when
it&#x27;s looking for laughs. Galifianakis is a revelation and surely a
comic star in the making, the Will Ferrell for the next ten years. The
others are all impressive but Galifianakis is simply too good as the
slightly unhinged Alan. The rest of the cast, from the delectable
Heather Graham to the bizarre cameo of Mike Tyson, are there simply to
play off the four leads but none give it anything less than 100% and it
shows. Tyson is bordering on unreal as the menacing homeboy hoodlum
complete with Blofeld-style white cat on his arm but (and here&#x27;s the
crucial point so often missed with cameo appearances) he&#x27;s still funny
and actually contributes to the movie hitting the funny bone. And boy,
does it strike with almost clinical precision and once the story gets
going, it almost never lets up as our increasingly perplexed losers go
from one disaster to the next.<br /><br />I am struggling to think of anything negative to say about &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; and aside from the ending which was a little too neat for my
liking, I simply cannot criticise a film that had my eyes watering
through laughing so much. Every scene is a classic, there is enough
dialogue in there to quote until a sequel arrives (and I really hope
one does!) and trying to pick a favourite moment is like trying to
decide which of the many cocktails you drank last night you enjoyed the
best - they all tasted good and all blew your head off. Unless bad
language upsets you, you have no reason for not seeing this movie. &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; lived up to pretty high expectations and then some and I will
have no hesitation to watch it all over again pretty soon. Unlike New
Year&#x27;s which, thankfully for my sister, only comes once every twelve
months.
