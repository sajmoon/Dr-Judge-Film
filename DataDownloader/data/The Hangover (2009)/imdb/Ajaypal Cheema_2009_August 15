If you&#x27;re looking for a movie to blow off some time and steam with,
then you should give this is a watch; if you are looking for an
innovative, witty film with pertinent social commentary, or satirical
elements, this is probably not the movie for you. I watched it
expecting a few laughs, some clich&#xE9;d storyline, and a bit of fun, and
that&#x27;s exactly what I got, though it did feel a bit incomplete, and
that&#x27;s probably the room that they&#x27;ve left for the sequel. This is a
fun film if you&#x27;re that sort of person, but not as good as it could&#x27;ve
been; if only they&#x27;d paid as much attention to story as they did to the
gags.
