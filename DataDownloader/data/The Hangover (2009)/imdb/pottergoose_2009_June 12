When I saw the preview for The Hangover, I first thought, &#x22;oh it&#x27;s just
going to be like one of those really stupid humor comedies like
American pie, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or knocked up. But boy was I
wrong. The movie was comedy genius. You laugh from the very first line
of the movie until the very end. Anyone can enjoy this comedy, young or
old. I went with my family, including my 85 year old grandma, and we
ALL loved it. I haven&#x27;t seen this good of a comedy since Grumpier Old
Men came out in the mid 90s. This is a feel good film that you will
want to watch again and again, and buy it on DVD when it comes out. I
definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
