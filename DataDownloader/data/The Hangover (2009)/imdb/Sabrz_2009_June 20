I have been waiting to see The Hangover ever since the first trailer
came out. It looked a great comedy and I was looking forward to seeing
it. Well I finally saw it last night, and I must say it was awesome. I
expected it to be funny, but it exceeded even my expectations.<br /><br />The Hangover follows 4 friends celebrating their bachelor party in an
outrageous fashion. They go to Las Vegas and are looking forward to
having a good time. However when they wake up the next morning, things
aren&#x27;t right. One friend is missing, one has lost a tooth, they find a
baby in their hotel room, and they can&#x27;t remember a thing. With the
wedding coming up in a few days the 3 of them must find their missing
friend. They spend the movie doing that with hilarious events happening
along the way.<br /><br />All of the actors deliver in the film. The supporting actors do a
fantastic job and Mike Tyson delivers a great punchline (I&#x27;m not
talking about a joke). As the days go by and the friends continue their
search, crazy things happen to them, each worse then the last. With
each passing scene the film gets funnier and funnier.<br /><br />The Hangover will make you laugh and it doesn&#x27;t let up on the comedy.
If you want to have a great laugh, this is the film to watch. It is
easily the funniest film of the year.
