My husband talked me into this one. Definitely not a chick flick. The
female characters are either stripper/call girls or bitches. Even from
a story standpoint it&#x27;s weak. If you&#x27;re going to have boys night out or
in this case the morning after boys not out, let&#x27;s see a little more of
what happened. Lots of chatting of how wild and crazy they got, but I
was drawn in by it. Unfortunately, after being enticed, a big no show.
Typical of men, all talk and no go. What happened, they ran over budget
so all the best scenes they just blab about and cover up with a series
of digital pictures. If boys will be boy, at least go for it and show
it. It was like they went to one scene to the next, talked about how
crazy a segment was, realize what happened and then move on without
showing it. With the exception of two moments, it was mostly talk and
no show. Sorry BOYS, next time, if you&#x27;re going to get your audience
excited, at least give US something to talk about after wards. And FYI,
even my husband was disappointed he didn&#x27;t get to experience the night
with the boys. The pictorial didn&#x27;t cut it.
