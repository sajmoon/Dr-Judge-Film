2009_July 27 
I had a feeling about this movie, from watching the trailers, and let
me say, it&#x27;s THE most hilarious movie I have ever seen. It&#x27;s escapism
at its best. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to roll into a movie theater, be
thoroughly entertained for 100 minutes and literally laugh your *ss off
so many times you come out feeling like you&#x27;ve done two hours of
crunches at the gym the next day? It&#x27;s rude. It&#x27;s vulgar. It&#x27;s raunchy.
It&#x27;s so, SO politically incorrect. And it doesn&#x27;t apologize for any of
it, which I LIKE. There are many grains of truth in it&#x27;s absurdity,
which really is what makes it so funny. The cast clicks and the story
line, while ridiculous, is engaging. I absolutely loved it. I&#x27;d go see
it again, and it would be just as funny the 2nd time.<br /><br />For those who hated it, to each his own. That&#x27;s why some of us like
sushi and some can&#x27;t stand it. C&#x27;est la vie.
