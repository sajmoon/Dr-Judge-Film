For his bachelor party, a man goes to Vegas with his buddies. Hilarity
ensues...sort of. The film tries very hard to to be funny but fails to
deliver many laughs. It is entertaining and provides enough amusement
to keep it from dragging. The script consists of a series of vignettes
that don&#x27;t all come together the way they do in the best comedies. The
sophistication level of the comedy is pretty low, a step above &#x22;The
Three Stooges,&#x22; and there is a sense of deja-vu to it all. There is a
Vegas segment in the 1999 comedy &#x22;Go&#x22; that is more amusing that
anything here. The main source of laughs here is the doofus
brother-in-law played by Galifianakis.
