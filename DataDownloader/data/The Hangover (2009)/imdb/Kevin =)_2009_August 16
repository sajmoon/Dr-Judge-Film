Well, yesterday I went to the cinema with my friends, and all of us
wanted to see this movie, because, you know, it seems like if everybody
loves it.<br /><br />I thought I&#x27;d have a big time and so, but, the beginning of the movie
was incredibly un-funny. &#x27;No big deal&#x27; I thought &#x27;The movie is gonna
get better&#x27;. But it didn&#x27;t. The movie never got better.<br /><br />It was almost boring. I did enjoy some parts, the movie really made me
laugh twice and smile a lot, but that&#x27;s all.<br /><br />I never explode in laughs or whatever. So I think this is not a pretty
cool comedy either.<br /><br />Seriously, the movie is not &#x27;that bad&#x27;, but God, when I came to IMDb
and saw it in the Top 250 I was so impressed. This movie doesn&#x27;t
deserve it.
