Yes, the F word was thrown out every 5 seconds, and in my opinion, a
few of the end credit pics were NOT necessary, but overall...this film
might just be the funniest comedy I&#x27;ve ever seen. Let me warn you, this
kind of humor is an acquired taste. It&#x27;s crude, obscene, and completely
stupid. If you aren&#x27;t a fan of Will Ferrell, there&#x27;s a good chance you
won&#x27;t appreciate this movie. However, for me, it went far beyond my
expectations.<br /><br />You will laugh at lines. You will laugh at situations. You will laugh
at WTF moments. As a 17 year old, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to the
younger ages, but I&#x27;d go out on a limb and say most 17+ would enjoy
this movie.<br /><br />Basically, I&#x27;m just trying to fill up my &#x22;10 lines&#x22; here...but GO SEE
THIS MOVIE. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. At all. I still laugh thinking
about it.
