When I first saw the trailer I thought there is another stupid comedy
filled with generic humor, but this movie was just amazing I was
laughing during the whole thing. Usually there are five or six
extremely funny moments in every-one of this kind of films but this was
entirely new experience. The plot is old, the actors are well known but
somehow the movie is just hilarious, I am absolutely serious when I say
that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. Everything in it is so
unpredictable you just do not know what will be the next absurdly funny
scene. And they do not over do it, something that is very, very
important because you would normally say to yourself when watching this
kind of movies, well that is just impossible or why am I watching this,
here instead you would say I just got to have one night like theirs.
And that is the thing that me and my friends said to each other after
the film. It is so unrealistic and at the same time so plausible in an
unbelievable way, that is what makes it so amazing extraordinary things
happen to ordinary people. My advice is to watch this movie because it
will change your entire idea of what comedies should be.
