When you talk about Hollywood Cinema... You would talk about films
like. The Shawshank Redemption. The Godfather. Citizen Kane. Scarface.
The Dark Knight. Titanic. The Departed. Now add &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; in that
legendary list.<br /><br />Now get this straight: &#x27;The Hangover&#x27;, directed by Todd Phillips, is
maybe the best film you&#x27;ll seen in years to come, or even in decades to
come. Fantasitc would be the most appropriate word to describe this
Masterpiece. All said &#x26; done, &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is cinema at its very
best. <br /><br />Performances: Bradely Cooper is excellent. Zach Galifianakis is
outstanding as Alan. Ed Helms is superb. Justin Bartha leaves an
impact, even though he&#x27;s only there for a cameo. Heather Graham looks
angelic as always and delivers a sincere performance as the hooker.
Others are perfect in their parts.<br /><br />on the whole &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is a MASTERPIECE. I enjoyed each and every
minute of this venture. Two Big Thumbs Up!
