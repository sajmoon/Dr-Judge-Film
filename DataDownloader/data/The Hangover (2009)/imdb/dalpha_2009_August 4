Like many others who has commented this movie, I must agree that my
relation to IMDb is damaged. Everybody knows that a movie like this
normally floats around 5 in rating. Around 6-7 if it&#x27;s a really good
comedy. The Hangover floats around 8 and a half at the moment. That
seems really much for a film that didn&#x27;t deliver anything near the last
years great comedy&#x27;s. They all float around 7 to 7 and a half. This
comedy had nothing new about it. The only funny thing was when Alan sad
he had plans for next weekend, cause The Jonas Brothers where in town.
I guess this movie and The Jonas Brothers target the same crowd. The
saddest thing about this film is that Hollywood is making a sequel.
