Before &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was released it was the talk of the town. Even
its previews were funny. I mean, although most comedy film&#x27;s previews
are funny&#x85;or are at least supposed to be funny. This was more than I
expected. Talk about &#x22;LOL.&#x22; The Hangover was more than &#x22;Laugh Out Loud&#x22;
funny. <br /><br />Even Mike Tyson, The Champ, surprised me with a little laughter in his
tiger scene.<br /><br />The plot of this film held my attention by making me want to see what
else happened &#x22;last night?&#x22; <br /><br />This comedic trio of Bradley Cooper as Phil Wennick, Ed Helms as Stu
Price, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner, tickled my funny bone with
their hilarious endeavors. Not only is &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; a knee slapper
and a belly cruncher, it could actually be a &#x22;Based on a true story&#x22;
film. It is that believable&#x85;yet, unbelievably funny!<br /><br />From start to finish this film is comedy at its best.
