A refreshing change in the story line and a slick cast of characters
makes The Hangover a must-see movie. The adult fun bordering on the
likes of Borat makes the movie kind of more a guy movie than a chic
movie. Not that chicks can&#x27;t dig it, but it does have some over the top
scenes which may cause severe embarrassment for some. The dialogs were
quite catchy, the acting I thought was quite quite well, and
Galifianakis, someone I never knew before this movie came into being,
is certainly a treat to watch. I would rate it to be less funny than
Superbad but somewhat in par with Wedding Crashers. Whatever the case a
movie you will want to see again. 8/10
