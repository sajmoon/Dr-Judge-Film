Stu Price: Why don&#x27;t we remember a God damn thing from last night? Phil
Wenneck: Obviously because we had a great F-ing time.<br /><br />Todd Phillips is a director who has become well known for creating
movies that appeal to young people who want to see a movie about
drinking too much and partying hard. The Hangover is no different from
some of his past movies.<br /><br />The Hangover follows four best friends, Doug Billings (Justin Bartha),
Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Alan Garner
(Zack Galifianakis). The men are headed out to Las Vegas for one last
crazy night before Doug gets married that weekend. As the title would
suggest that is just what the men have one crazy night. The rest of the
movie is spent trying to figure out just what happened the night
before. If you have never seen a Todd Phillips movie in the past this
one is no different. The Hangover contains all of the dirty humor that
fans of Phillips&#x27; movies have come to love. If you have never seen a
Todd Phillips movie be forewarned that you are in for lots of crude
humor and non stop laughs! <br /><br />Each character brings their own form of comedy to the screen. Alan is
Doug&#x27;s soon to be brother in law. He is the black sheep of the family
and is constantly saying inappropriate and stupid things that keep the
laughs coming. Phil is the one who constantly pulls the group back
together. He may not be the most level headed one in the group but he
is just what the group needs to throw caution to the wind. Stu is the
quiet friend who gets picked on and just tags along. He may not like
the decisions that the group is making but he follows along because he
is too passive to disagree. Finally there is Doug, he is the most grown
up of the group. Doug is the whole reason for the group coming together
as he is the one getting married. Take Alan, Stu, Phil, and Doug mix
them with way too much alcohol and a night in Sin City and now you have
The Hangover. Once again Todd Phillips has made a movie that makes
every viewer wish they were there for the party.
