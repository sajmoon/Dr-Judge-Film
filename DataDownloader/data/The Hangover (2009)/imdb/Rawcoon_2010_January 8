I&#x27;ve always liked Todd Phillips&#x27; ,ovies, but there was always something
missing. Road Trip had it&#x27;s moments, but nothing more. Old School had a
really good story, but wasn&#x27;t all that funny. And Starsky and Hutch is
pretty good, but since it&#x27;s based on an old series he can&#x27;t do whatever
he want, but now his time has come. Hangover is one of the best
comedies I&#x27;ve ever seen! It starts out really good with a phone call to
a bride who&#x27;s getting married today, but that&#x27;s not gonna happen, they
F***ed up under the bachelor party and &#x22;lost&#x22; the groom, they can&#x27;t
find him. Then it picks up two days earlier before they go to Vegas to
have the party.<br /><br />Just after this short intro you&#x27;re sucked into the movie and all it&#x27;s
funny quotes and kinky situations. What makes this better than the
other Phillips movies is he has a good, interesting story with funny
situations and funny, likable characters, and the humor is top notch!!
It really lives up to the title, with three (four) guys waking up the
morning after the bachelor party in a trashed hotel room and is having
a hard time remembering what the f*** happened last night. And it goes
on from there. I&#x27;m not gonna say anymore, cause it&#x27;s probably better to
see it yourself.<br /><br />After I saw this movie once I knew this was one of my top 3 comedies,
along with Tropic Thunder and The Big Lebowski, and I just wanted to
see it again. This film really has a lot of replay value, it&#x27;s just as
funny the third time as the first! Just as Tropic and Lebowski is for
me now, I&#x27;ve seen them more than 10 times and they are still as funny.
Tropic is almost more funny now after I&#x27;ve watched it 10 times cause I
can shout out the great quotes along with the characters in the movie
and I&#x27;m sure it will be like this with hangover. It hasn&#x27;t got as many
awesome quotes as Tropic, but is still fun, fun, fun! <br /><br />So, I&#x27;m really glad Phillips finally made a great comedy with both a
good story and the best laughs you&#x27;ve ever had. He had the potential,
but just had to try and &#x22;fail&#x22; sometimes first. Let&#x27;s just hope
Hangover 2 is equally good (or better?!!?). This is an easy 10*, it&#x27;s
got more or less everything I need from a good comedy. It don&#x27;t hold
back on swearing or sex to make it a say PG-13 rating or something,
those comedies often fails in my book. And I actually have a book:P
