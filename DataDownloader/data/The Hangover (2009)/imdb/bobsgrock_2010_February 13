With all due respect to Judd Apatow and his outrageous filmography, The
Hangover is probably the best comedy of the decade, maybe the best
since The Big Lebowski. What is so good about this film that it was
heaped upon with critical and box office acclaim, not to mention a
Golden Globe for Best Comedy? Of course there are terrific one-liners
and other jokes you will be quoting long after seeing the movie, but
there is also the reason for how innovative of a comedy this actually
is.<br /><br />A very common plot of many modern comedies involves people getting
drunk, going to Las Vegas, letting completely loose before a wedding;
these are plot elements that have become so simple and common it is
almost impossible to realize just how serious and dangerous they can
be. Although the film makers will probably deny this, there is a
definite part of this movie that is anti-drug/alcohol. This film shows
the true nature of the Vegas lifestyle: crazy, wild and totally
unpredictable in terms of what situations you can get yourself into.
Certainly no one will see this as something to glean from the movie,
but it certainly separates this comedy from all the others.<br /><br />Not to mention the story line of this movie and how it uses the
flashback to bring us along. This is a plot technique usually reserved
for dramas, thrillers, more &#x27;serious&#x27; films. Yet director Todd Phillips
and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore make it work because they take
their time setting up the situations, pacing at just the right speed,
never punching home the jokes and set-ups like a sitcom. Through a
series of interviews and searching, the guys slowly start to unravel
that crazy night they have no memory of. This makes it funnier because
we learn at the same time the characters do so their reactions are
funnier.<br /><br />Of course none of this would be possible without the terrific cast led
by the talented Bradley Cooper, proving he can play a multidimensional
character. His support group is Ed Helm of The Office, very funny as a
whipped dentist and newcomer Zach Galifianakis as the slow but very
funny Alan. The groom in distress is Justin Bartha, very strong as Doug
and other supporting actors include Heather Graham as a stripper with a
heart of gold, Ken Jeong as a mysteriously creepy Asian crime boss,
Jeffrey Tambor as the all-understanding father-in-law and Mike Tyson
as... himself.<br /><br />With all innovative plot techniques and subtle messages aside, this is
a very funny movie. The writing as a strong dark tone to it which makes
you laugh but also think about these characters and their motivation.
Unlike films that just go for the big laugh like Wedding Crashers, Old
School and Anchorman, well this film does too. But it does it in such a
fresh and exciting way for comedies, the standard has now been raised.
