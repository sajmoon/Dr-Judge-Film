This movie to me is not only the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen so far in my
life but also the BEST movie I have seen in 2009 so far. Todd Phillips
(known also for directing Old School) delivers a smash hit that will
stick in my mind for a very long time.<br /><br />The movie consists of many actors not very popular but they couldn&#x27;t
have picked better people to portray these Roles. Bradley Cooper, Ed
Helms and the hilarious Zack Galifianakis are the best trio in any
comedy movie I can remember. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters
and each time it felt like I had never seen it before because I was
laughing out of my seat almost every scene. If you are having a bad
day, watch this movie and you will laugh so hard you won&#x27;t remember
what a bad day is.
