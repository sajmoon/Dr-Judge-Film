In the opening of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, in the middle of the Mohave Desert,
Bradley Cooper&#x27;s haggard Phil calls Doug&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;e Tracy (Sasha
Barrese) to inform her that they have &#x22;lost&#x22; Doug (Justin Bartha).
Distressed Tracy reminds Phil that they are getting married in 5 hours.
Phil replies, &#x22;Yeah&#x85; that&#x27;s not going to happen.&#x22; Director Todd
Phillips&#x27;s &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is the funniest movie of the year. And the
story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is brilliantly hysterical.<br /><br />The premise is outrageous. In a Las Vegas bachelor party completely
gone awry, a group of buddies wake up the next morning to discover
their Caesar&#x27;s Palace suite demolished, with a tiger in the bathroom, a
baby, but missing the groom Doug (Bartha). Phil (Cooper) has sore ribs
and a hospital wristband. Dentist Stu (funny Ed Helms from &#x22;The
Office&#x22;) is bloodied and missing a tooth. Tracy&#x27;s brother Alan (wacked
out Zach Galifanakis) is sans pants. All three have no clue what
happened in the previous 10 hours, when they lost Doug. The last thing
they basically remember is making a toast with Alan&#x27;s Jaeger Meister.
Phil, Stu, and Alan must pool their damaged resources and return Doug
for his wedding back in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The defining moment of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; comes when the crew watches a
surveillance video with Mike Tyson at his home. Mike asks, &#x22;You guys
stole a police car?&#x22; Stu sheepishly cops to this. Mike high fives
saying, &#x22;Nice!&#x22; Later after watching the entire debacle on tape, Phil
apologizes to Tyson. Mike says, &#x22;We do dumb sh**, when we&#x27;re f***ed
up.&#x22; That pretty much sums up Todd Phillips&#x27;s &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. It is a
hysterical ride, and ultimately all plausible. Make sure to stay
through the credits of the movie. Bradley Cooper as ring leader Phil is
going to be a star. He is tall, handsome, and has great comedic timing.
Cooper also is the surprising solid one, who literally rolls with the
punches. Ed Helms is the brilliantly unglued Stu, who is about marry
his bitch girl friend Melissa (taut and scary Rachael Harris). Zach
Galifianakis is initially warped creepy as Alan. He points out to Doug
when they pick up teacher Phil that he can&#x27;t be within 200 feet of a
school or a Chuck E Cheese. Galifianakis effectively morphs into a
lovable loner. Justin Bartha nails the straight man Doug. He is so
comfortable being with funny, which is not easy.<br /><br />While blitzed out his mind Stu marries big hearted stripper/ escort
Jade (stunning and hysterical Heather Graham). Graham is amazing and
beautifully lends &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; its deceptive charm. With all the high
jinx including being attacked by a naked Chinese mobster Mr. Chow
(funny Ken Jeong) wielding a crow bar or being stun-gunned by kids in
the police station demonstration, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is all fun and never
mean spirited. Writers Lucas and Moore craft a hilarious tale that is
strangely plausible, and really about heart-felt friendship. Granted
there are more hysterical moments that should not be missed. What I
really appreciated about &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is its spirit and sense of fun.
&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is one the funniest movies around.
