Hey....I&#x27;m a guy who loves all types of humor, both highbrow (most
Woody Allen films) and low (Billy Madison, Bachelor Party). As an
example of a film in the lowbrow category, The Hangover
disappoints......tremendously. There is no doubt, however, that the
context of extreme hype this movie generated added to my
disappointment. <br /><br />After seeing Bradley Cooper in this movie and in other roles, I now
conclude that he is an actor of limited range, delivering forgettable
performances, and who adds absolutely no value to any film. In
contrast, Ed Helms appears to be an actor perfect for a comedic role. I
will definitely seek out his future performances (Hangover 2 the
exception). The director, Todd Philips, produced two other forgettable
movies in the same buddy format as Hangover: Road Trip and Old School.
Both are derivative, unfunny films. Look for him to churn out more junk
in the same mold. <br /><br />Believe me&#x85; I love to allow the juvenile in me to enjoy a crazy buddy
movie. I just don&#x27;t get this film. If you enjoy crazy movies that
Hangover attempts to emulate watch Clerks, Billy Madison, Little Nicky,
or even Dodge Ball.<br /><br />If you to continue to have a desire to see this movie wait for its
appearance on a non-premium cable channel.<br /><br />Nuff Said
