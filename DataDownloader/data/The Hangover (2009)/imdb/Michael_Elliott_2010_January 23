Hangover, The (2009) <br /><br />*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br /><br />Four buddies head off to Vegas for a bachelor party but the next
morning they wake up not knowing what happened the night before and
discovering one is missing. They must then try to retrace their steps
and locate the missing buddy. I&#x27;m always a bit hesitant to fall into
the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of
times I end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major
disappointment but that&#x27;s not the case with this gem because it lived
up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them. I&#x27;m not going to
call this the greatest film of the year but I might add it&#x27;s the most
original. You&#x27;d think a comedy about getting messed up in Vegas would
be &#x22;been there, done that&#x22; but this takes a familiar set up and does
something original with it. Instead of showing us the crazy party
night, we don&#x27;t see a second of it and instead we&#x27;re thrown into a
mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery. For
my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at
building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to
places that you certainly won&#x27;t see coming. The majority of the laughs
come from things that you normally wouldn&#x27;t expect like a masterful
scene involving a trunk. Even the jokes that you do expect (strippers)
is done extremely well and with hilarious results. I won&#x27;t ruin many of
the jokes because of the &#x22;mystery&#x22; behind them is what makes them work
so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my
face from laughing so hard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach
Galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic
timing with one another helps push the film even further. The three
make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like
the trio had been working together for years because they come off so
well together. Heather Graham isn&#x27;t too bad in her role and the great
Jeffrey Tambor even gets a nice laugh. You really have to respect a
movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it
being completely original and most importantly, downright hilarious. I
hate labeling films when they&#x27;re so fresh but I would be shocked if
this movie isn&#x27;t looked at in ten years the same way we look at &#x22;dirty&#x22;
comedies like NATIONAL LAMPOON&#x27;S ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY&#x27;S today.
