&#x22;You mind putting on some pants? I feel weird having to ask you twice.&#x22;<br /><br />It has become so rare in this century, to find a genuinely decent and
funny comedy. In the crowd of Scary Movie type comedies, Todd Phillips&#x27;
fresh and hilarious The Hangover stands out as a clear winner for
modern comedy.<br /><br />The plot is simple: four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor
party and wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened the
previous night, this plus the fact that they don&#x27;t know where the groom
is makes for a roller-coaster ride of hilarity as the remaining three
friends try to find him in time for his wedding the next day.<br /><br />In short, The Hangover is just genuinely funny. It may actually be the
funniest movie I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of watching in a long time, so
much so that it has become one of my favourite movies. Galifianakis,
the &#x22;child with a beard&#x22;, effectively makes this movie the brilliantly
hilarious trip that it is. His unashamedly idiotic behaviour provides
much of the hilarity and it seems as if the movie would be pretty empty
without him. But all three leading men have brilliant chemistry
together and it&#x27;s hard to imagine anyone else playing a different role
in this movie.<br /><br />The Hangover is sure to become a cult classic and I don&#x27;t see it ever
getting old. I also really never thought I&#x27;d be feeling sorry for
Heather Graham&#x27;s character at the end. So far I&#x27;ve seen this five times
and I&#x27;ll probably watch it a hundred times more. A definite must buy!<br /><br />http://ukmore.tk/
