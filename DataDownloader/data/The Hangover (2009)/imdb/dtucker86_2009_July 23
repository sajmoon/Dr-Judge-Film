2009_July 23 
For the life of me, I do not know why this pathetic excuse for a film
even made a million let alone becoming one of the biggest hits of the
year. This is the first movie I have ever seen that I have walked out
of, I left with a little less then a half hour to go. You don&#x27;t have to
eat a whole apple to know that its a rotten one, a good analogy for
this pathetic film. It does not have anything resembling intelligence,
humor or style. These three guys are so stupid and unlikeable that you
don&#x27;t give a damn about them or if they find their friend. That is the
first rule for liking a film, you have to care about the characters.
There was a friend who saw this film who said it was junk and told me
to stay away from it and boy I wish I had listened. This movie is an
insult to the intelligence of every intelligent moviegoer.
