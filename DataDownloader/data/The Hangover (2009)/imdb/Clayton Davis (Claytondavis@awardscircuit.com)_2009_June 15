Todd Phillips, who has been a director who really misses his mark (with
the exception of Old School) has landed his footing among comedic
filmmakers. The Hangover is my favorite comedy of the year so far and
is sure to become a cult classic among college students and young
people.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a middle aged man who
goes on a bachelor night with his best friends, Stu (Ed Helms, &#x22;Andy&#x22;
from &#x27;The Office&#x27;), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and his fianc&#xE9;e&#x27;s strange
brother Alan (breakthrough performer Zach Galifianakis). After a night
of heavy drinking and waking up to a missing Doug, the three amigos
venture out to find clues to their missing comrade. <br /><br />The comedy here is incredible with the raunchy humor that hits and
sticks every time. The script keeps a great pace and keeps you laughing
the whole time. Helms and Galifianakis hit hugely in this film and
steal the show every time. The Hangover never loses sight of its
objective and remembers its target audience. Through the laughs we are
immensely stuck on these four guys and their quest to find fallen mate.
There&#x27;s actually a wonderful love story wrapped up in all laughs and a
wonderful lesson to be learned....don&#x27;t drink jagermeister!<br /><br />****/****
