Rubbish! Seriously...a rubbish comedy. This has been done so many times
before. So let me tell you,I saw nothing original in the Hangover. It&#x27;s
the same American Pie Farrelly Brothers Jackass comedy, Americans have
been churning out for the past 10 years. A few laughs here and there
but that&#x27;s all. The Hangover is one of those films that has been
unneccessaryly hyped. And the truth is ...there&#x27;s nothing special about
it! Four grown men frolicking in the Las Vegas desert has been to death
and that was more or less the premise of the film. I even think I fell
a sleet a couple of times because some parts were so boring. Expect
American directors and producers to churn out more of this trash in
years to come. Unoriginal, unfunny and an overrated comedy. Worst film
of the year by far and this will probably my easiest review of the
year.
