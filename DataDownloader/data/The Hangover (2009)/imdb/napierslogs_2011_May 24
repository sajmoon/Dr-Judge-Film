The Vegas comedy done right. Mostly because &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is actually
funny. Very funny. As the guys start out on their bachelor party trip
to Las Vegas we quickly get a sense of how funny this will be because
of the sense of humour the characters have. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is
completely unscrupulous, but that&#x27;s okay he&#x27;s only a school teacher.
Alan (Zach Galifianakis) thinks the prospect of killing someone or
being killed is absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Their tame night becomes morning and questions need to be answered. In
order of increasing severity: Whose baby is in the mini-fridge? Why is
there a tiger in the bathroom? Will Alan put his pants on? And where is
Doug? Finding Doug will answer the other questions but it will also
take all day and all night and raise more questions that need
answering.<br /><br />This works because we want to find the answers. The questions which we
start with are just so outrageous, original and intriguing that we know
they will be funny. Along the way we also want to find Doug. He&#x27;s the
sane and normal one so surely our world will be righted once we find
him.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; achieved greatness because people weren&#x27;t expecting it.
Hollywood didn&#x27;t produce it, so to the masses, it came out of nowhere.
It made Bradley Cooper a movie star, Zach Galifianakis a fearless
comedian and gave Ed Helms the respect he deserved. I&#x27;m hoping Part II
will do the same for Justin Bartha, but it&#x27;s hard to come out of
nowhere after Hollywood has hyped it for two years.
