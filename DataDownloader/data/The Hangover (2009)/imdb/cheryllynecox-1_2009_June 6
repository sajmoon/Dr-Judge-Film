You know how sometimes a film&#x27;s buzz can be so loud that your high
expectations are undermined by mindless drek? &#x22;Hangover&#x22; is not one of
those films. Brilliantly paced, the laughs were in almost every bizarre
development, and the actors were so superb that every absurd twist, and
nearly every line seemed natural. <br /><br />A few sequences were exceptionally worthwhile -- the first morning
after events set up the rest of the film with outrageous sight gags
that suggested epic debauchery without revealing too much too soon. <br /><br />Stay through the credits for a big payoff. You&#x27;ll laugh until you
hiccup, and then after you catch your breath, you&#x27;ll laugh even harder.
In fact, I may need a comedy intervention.
