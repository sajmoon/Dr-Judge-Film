I would give it an 8.5 but you can&#x27;t. It is a hilarious movie I have
not laughed some much at the theater in my life. I was even tearing up
I laughed so hard at times. I don&#x27;t want to give away anything but
another good thing is it is not one of those movies that shows all the
funny parts in the trailers. Although they don&#x27;t show the tiger in the
elevator scene in the actual movie.<br /><br />It is very entertaining and is of the Old School and Road Trip
mentality and has the usual cameo by Phillips. Don&#x27;t go in expecting
the best movie in the last 10 years, just know it will be funny and
worth the $10 bucks. The cast fit well with each other and kept me
laughing most of the movie, make sure you watch the credits.
