This is definitely one of the funniest movies since ages and for me it
comes right after &#x22;the 40 year old virgin&#x22; and &#x22;The big Lebowsky&#x22;,
which I consider as the funniest movies for men ever. <br /><br />Gladly all the stupid &#x22;hollywood business as usual love stuff&#x22; was left
out of this one. It&#x27;s full of surprises and not only a commercial copy
of other successful comedies like so many others I have seen within the
last 3 years.<br /><br />I guess I will see it over and over when it comes out on DVD. <br /><br />Because I consider the music as slightly too commercial, I&#x27;ll keep the
last point for me and hope there will be a second part of this next
year.
