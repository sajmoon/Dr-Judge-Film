I heard from &#x22;word of mouth&#x22; that this was to be a must see, hilarious
comedy. It started off really well, and I give it credit for &#x22;reversing
the process&#x22; versus the standard formulaic screenplay &#x22;structure&#x22;.
Somewhere in Act II it began to get a bit flat. The caricatures over
&#x22;characters&#x22;, the implausibility issues, and most of all THE VULGARITY.
To me the movie deserves it&#x27;s place (albeit, as does the other 99% of
comedies and romantic comedies) in the &#x22;bin of mediocrity and cheap
gimmicks&#x22;. The reason for the negative review is due to the
expectations I had going in. I was expecting something truly
remarkable. It was not that. I&#x27;m 35, and haven&#x27;t quite figured out this
ever growing paradigm: &#x22;vulagarity-is-funny&#x22;. I couldn&#x27;t believe there
were 5 year old kids in the theater. Guess, I&#x27;ll stick to my drama&#x27;s,
and sci-fi, and action flicks.
