There are so many different direction I could go here so here I go....<br /><br />I remember seeing a billboard for this movie about a month before it
came out and I thought FAIL. Now on Friday of opening weekend, I just
blew everything off and figured what the hell. The theater was packed
which surprised me but it was easily one of the rare gems that comes
out during the year. Most movies are overly hyped and consequently
never live up to expectations but this movie hit on every cylinder.
It&#x27;s one of those movies that magically finds it&#x27;s way into o my DVD
almost on a weekly basis. The script was hilarious, it was well shot,
but I have to give most of the credit to the actors. The comedic timing
enhanced the hilarity of the storyline ten fold.<br /><br />I knew of Bradley Cooper from Wedding Crashers and he played a very
similar role here. He&#x27;s the cool, jocky guy...likable even though he&#x27;s
a bit of a jerk. He did a great job but the star of them all was
obviously Zack. The guy steals every single scene. I can&#x27;t go much into
detail, it&#x27;s just something you have to experience. Easily my favorite
comedy of at least the past 5 years.
