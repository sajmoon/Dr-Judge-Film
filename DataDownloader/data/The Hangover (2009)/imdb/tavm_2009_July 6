Well, I finally got to see the comedy sleeper of the summer: The
Hangover. In this one, three groomsmen (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack
Galifianakis) are looking for the about-to-be-wed friend (Justin
Bartha) after an alcohol-induced bachelor party in Las Vegas. This
leads to so many weird twists and turns that listing them here doesn&#x27;t
do them justice. Let&#x27;s just say a certain boxer is involved as well as
a tiger, a baby, and an accidental marriage of one of the groomsmen.
Many lines and scenes are both cringe and laugh-inducing enough that I
had a pretty good time throughout. By the way, I recommend you stay for
some of the ending credit sequence. And I definitely recommend you
watch this quite most hilarious and at times touching movie, The
Hangover.
