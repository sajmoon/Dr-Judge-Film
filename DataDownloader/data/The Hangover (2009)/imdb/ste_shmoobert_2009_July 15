I reckon it will be noted as the funniest film this year as I think it
would be hard to top. It is certainly the best comedy I&#x27;ve seen for a
couple of years. The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of
main characters played by very talented comedic actors. The performance
that sticks out is Zach Galifianakis&#x27; character &#x27;Alan&#x27;. Zach has
brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this
films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the
point of a comedy masterpiece. As a film fan who is partial to only
rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect, this film reminds
me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we
enjoy it so much. My Dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally
sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh
as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor
can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in
film. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not
wish to say anything about the story. The best thing to do is to go and
see this film for yourself and you&#x27;ll realize what i&#x27;m talking about.
