The Hangover is a reckless comedy that follows the usual male bonding
road trip formula but with an edge that makes it stand out from the
rest of the pack of sophomoric comedies made in this vein.<br /><br />Stu, his two best friends and his rather odd brother in law head for
Vegas to celebrate his bachelor party. On the rooftop of the Bellagio
they drink a toast to the night ahead. Flash forward to the next
morning where three of the four awake to a trashed suite with a tiger
in the bathroom and a baby in a bedroom. Stu is nowhere to be found and
everyone&#x27;s memory (due to spiked drinks) of the night before is a blank
slate. In order to find Stu and get him to the church on time they must
piece together the night before.<br /><br />Hangover&#x27;s ability to maintain a degree of suspense, albeit comic,
throughout while remaining irreverently hilarious as it goes in an out
of bounds of credulity and taste is what makes it a refreshing
entertainment. So a wedding chapel owner gets shot in the shoulder with
no repercussions or the hapless trio agree to be tasered by police in a
classroom who then give students a turn. Ridiculous? Yes? Hysterical?
That too. <br /><br />It&#x27;s clearly a guy film with it&#x27;s un PC chauvinism, insensitivity and
actions by the eclectic band of jerks in full display of extended
adolescence but women&#x27;s laughter was every bit as evident as men the
day I caught the show. It was easy to see why.
