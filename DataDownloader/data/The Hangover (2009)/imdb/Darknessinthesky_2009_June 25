It took a while for me to build sympathy for the characters. The action
starts slow too. I guess they could have shortened the first half hour
or so. Some of the fun things we are seeing later aren&#x27;t explained to
satisfaction. How they end up as they are going to is explained
deus-ex-machina-style...quite lame, sadly. Some fun stuff, some
childish scary-movie-type of jokes.<br /><br />While this is an entertaining flick I don&#x27;t understand how it wound up
on #130. Better than Snatch, Big Lebowski et al? No way! In my opinion
this is one of the better comedies of the last several years but that
is about it - especially since the best part of the movie comes with
the credits. So much stuff you could have exploited in the movie
itself. Oh and you can see a boobie of that chick from Scrubs. That&#x27;s a
big plus!
