When did I laugh so much for a movie....long time!! If you are in for a
good laugh...go for it! The movie is just fantastically made, with all
the characters fitting in perfectly for the roles. Bradley Cooper, Zach
Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all so very amazing. Its Vegas baby, and
who doesn&#x27;t want to be there! The Script is perfect for the location
(bachelor party) and the Director, Todd Phillips has just made a wonder
out of it. Except for the scene where they carry back the Tiger, I
never felt that there was any moment in the movie that looked &#x22;unreal&#x22;.
Plain movie where circumstances take them around, and made such a good
humorous flick out of it. Phil (Bradley Cooper), the cool dude, driving
the story, with Alan (Zach) in all that crazy stuff and Stu (Ed Helms)
cracking those comments just perfectly fit in to make it a mind blowing
hilarious flick. A special mention to Jade (Heather Graham) who looks
lovely as ever making the guys skip a beat for sure. Mike Tyson with
his best punch and the Chinese guy Ken Jeong with his unique style just
make it a worth watch file. Liked the last part the most where they
check out the pics and finally have the mystery unfolded.<br /><br />Must watch movie guys. I did already twice.
