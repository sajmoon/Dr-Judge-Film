It&#x27;s not often a frat-type comedy (only this time with adults) enjoys
the financial success or peer recognition and there&#x27;s no doubt there
was / is about this particular movie, so with my interest piqued I
settled down to an expected laugh-fest...only to be a little let down
and underwhelmed by what I saw.<br /><br />In its favour, it boasts Las Vegas as its principal location backdrop,
an engaging cast of mostly unknowns and a plot which resembles, if
distantly, that of &#x22;Memento&#x22;, only with a comic twist as our three
intrepids seek to retrace their steps the morning after a particularly
heavy-duty drug-fuelled night before, which sees them &#x22;lose&#x22; their
erstwhile buddy on his stag night. A good deal of the comedy borders on
the surreal, taking in a call-girl and her baby who gets hitched
Vegas-style to the put-upon dental doctor, an Oriental crime-lord who
wants his casino winning restored in return for their kidnapped buddy
and unbelievably washed up boxer Iron Mike Tyson and entourage,
including his pet tiger. All the missing gaps are restored to the guys
in a clever montage of still photographs as the titles roll as the
groom gets, just, to his wedding on time...<br /><br />It&#x27;s all performed with great gusto to an almost ever-present
modern-day soundtrack and I can certainly see how the film would take
with thirty-somethings and under. Being myself, however, much the wrong
side of thirty (or forty come to that), I found the humour just too
broad and slapdash for me. Going by the movie&#x27;s box-office take, many
millions of cinema-goers and from the high average mark, a great
majority of IMDb reviewers obviously beg to differ, but at least I was
spared the total-gross-out experience I feared at the outset.
