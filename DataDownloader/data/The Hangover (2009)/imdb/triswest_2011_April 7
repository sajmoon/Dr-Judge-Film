2011_April 7 
The Hangover is one of the few comedies that manages to be funny all
the way through. aside from the funniness (which points to the good
writing and acting) it actually does a very good job at describing the
experience of being that mashed and in that sense has a seriously good
side too.<br /><br />do not watch it if you&#x27;re easily offended. if you&#x27;re not easily
offended and you haven&#x27;t seen it you have a treat in store. it&#x27;s not
necessarily a guy film either, a bit like Forgetting Sarah Marshall
isn&#x27;t necessarily a girl film- they are just both very funny films.<br /><br />Hangover 2 is out late May 2011 and i&#x27;ll watch it for sure. if it&#x27;s
half as good as the first it&#x27;ll be twice as good as most comedies.
