A lot of movies try different methods of creating humor. Whether it be
parody (Spaceballs), slapstick (The Marx Brothers), drug/alcohol use
(Pineapple Express) or simply a chain reaction of one disaster after
another (Mouse Hunt). The Hangover uses a combination of the latter two
and it does this very well. It all starts with four guys having a
bachelor party in Los Vegas, only to pass out and wake up the next
morning with no idea of what happened to them. To make matters worse,
the groomsman-to-be is missing, and what follows is one unexpected (yet
hilarious) moment after another. The whole thing is like a murder
mystery if it was written by Hunter S. Thompson. The trouble that the
characters created and their need to find out how it happened leads to
some very creative conclusions.<br /><br />The plot has many similarities with Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?, but it isn&#x27;t
as corny. This movie takes the same idea and makes it more &#x27;grown up&#x27;
so it can be taken somewhat seriously but still have plenty of laughs.
Even if you won&#x27;t remember it the next day, The Hangover will not
disappoint.
