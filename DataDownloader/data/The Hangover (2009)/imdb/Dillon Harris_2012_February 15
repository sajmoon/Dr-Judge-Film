The Hangover is a hilarious movie with a well thought out storyline and
a great main cast,Zach Galifanakis,Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper are all
a delight,I have yet to have seen the second one although have seen
this numerous times,I heard it wasn&#x27;t as good and i cant imagine that
its as good as this.Alan is my favorite character in the
movie,everything he says is extremely quotable.<br /><br />Four friends,Doug,Phil,Stu and Alan head off on a bachelor night in
Vegas before Doug gets married,they wake up the next morning with no
memory of the following night,there&#x27;s a tiger and a baby in there hotel
room and Doug is missing,they must retrace there steps to find Doug and
find out what else happened that night.
