Maybe it was over-hyped, maybe it just sucked, but this movie is
overrated. I am not a movie snob, but this movie was not very funny.
There was not one scene that made me belly laugh. Bradley Cooper always
seems to play the a-hole and his eyes are annoyingly crooked. Zach G is
so much better on Bored to Death. Hated the way they used the baby.
Anyway, good concept with weak writing. If you want a mindless comedy
Old School is much better, but as far as this year, Funny People had
more depth and way more laughs. Don&#x27;t believe the hype! See it just to
tell people how dumb it was. IMDb says I have to write more, but I
can&#x27;t even think of any more to say about this piece of crap.
