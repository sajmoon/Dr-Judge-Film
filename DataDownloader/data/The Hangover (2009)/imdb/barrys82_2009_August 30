Usually when people talk about hangovers they usually meant about the
day after drinking a lot. In this case The Hangover is the most
ingenious comedy I&#x27;ve seen in the year. Directed by Todd Phillips, The
Hangover contains all kind of comedy and humor existed in this world.
It is an hour and a half full of laughs. It is cleverly written, Two
days before his wedding, Doug and his three friends drive to Las Vegas
for a blow-out bachelor party they&#x27;ll never forget. The movie follows a
fast paced rhythm, a very nice thin for the viewer because you never
get tired or bored. It also has some great locations in Las Vegas, in
fact you can see two different faces of Vegas, one at night so
glamorous and shiny and the other in the desert with amazing
landscapes. Another thing you appreciate from the movie is its
wonderful soundtrack, the music is so good and every song in it fits to
the perfection with every scene in the film. The cast is excellent
every actor and actress delivers an excellent and convincing
performance specially Zach Galifianakis as Alan, he was so funny and
the special appearance from Mike Tyson was great. The Hangover only
purpose is to entertain people and I&#x27;m sure people will enjoy every
minute of it. In conclusion, it is the best comedy of the year.
