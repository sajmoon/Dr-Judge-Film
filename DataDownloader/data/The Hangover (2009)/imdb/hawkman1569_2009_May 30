I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the
money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking
that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just
the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even
Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me
up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better
about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will
DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes
out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find
this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my
opinion.
