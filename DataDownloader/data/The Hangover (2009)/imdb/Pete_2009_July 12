I questioned how good this would be since I first saw the trailer. I
had my doubts, but everyone kept telling me how hysterical it was.
Sure, I chuckled once or twice, but this was far from funny. Certainly
nothing like Old School or Wedding Crashers (which is what everyone who
&#x27;raved&#x27; about the film compared it to). The funniest part of the entire
film was when the credits rolled. I don&#x27;t mean that as an insult. That
part really was funny. Other than that, I felt most of the jokes were
flat, cheap sight gags and very few witty lines.<br /><br />I&#x27;d wait for this one on rental. Even then , it&#x27;s not that great.
Should have listened to my gut after I first saw the trailer.
