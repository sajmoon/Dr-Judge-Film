I absolutely loved this movie! Strange as it may be, out of all the
movies I&#x27;ve seen this year at the cinema, this is now my highest rated
film. (And I like to see at least one movie per week) <br /><br />Without a doubt, this is the funniest movie that I&#x27;ve seen in years. It
starts with a constant chuckle as they establish each character and
then kicks it in to high gear. Perfectly structured and purely
hilarious, this film throws one outrageous situation after the other
and you actually feel like you&#x27;re the fourth (or fifth) member of this
road trip. The photos over the closing credits had the audience I saw
it with literally laughing all the way in to the parking lot leaving
the film. This is as funny and as fun as it gets.
