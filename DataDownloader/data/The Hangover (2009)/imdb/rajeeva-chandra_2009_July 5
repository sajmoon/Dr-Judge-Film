After a long time here&#x27;s a movie that brings in great fun and comedy.
If you love road trip, euro trip sort of movies, you will love this one
as well. This is one movie during which you cannot stop laughing. Kudos
to the director and the cast! The three guys in the movie are really
cool and they did a terrific job. Nothing new when it comes to Heather
though. She plays just another stripper kinda role. Tyson was funny,
but just like him in the ring. The movie is just not predictable and
the script is just cool. Thanks guys for making us laugh our stomachs
out. Watch out for the fat guy character, he is great. The movie is
real stress buster and ideal for a Friday evening, just right thing to
do after that hectic week. Would definitely recommend one
watch...Enjoy!
