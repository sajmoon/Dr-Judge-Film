this film sucks, and IMDb is losing its credibility by showing this
kind of titles on the top 250 list! and curiously while they are still
being shown on theaters... according to the top 250 list, this film is
better than &#x22;lock, stock and two smoking barrels&#x22;, don&#x27;t miss it and
decide for yourself!! can we still believe in what we see on this site?
And now i have to write up to 10 lines of text so that it matches the
minimum site comment length. This is an embarrassing situation,
IMDb.com owes its users an explanation for that! I&#x27;m feeling a little
weird, i hope we won&#x27;t discover in the following days some secret
contract between this site and film producers. Is it long enough like
that?
