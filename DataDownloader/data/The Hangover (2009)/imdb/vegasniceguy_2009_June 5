Anybody who comments about how this is a &#x22;guy&#x27;s only film&#x22; should know
that my doctorate wife laughed as hard and frequent as I have ever seen
her laugh. This is an exceptionally well-written movie. There was only
one spot where I felt I knew what was happening next. The Asian bad
guy, Mr. Chow, was very funny at first but his gay side was overdone. <br /><br />The ending was superb bringing the entire picture to closure for us. We
laughed throughout the entire movie. My wife did not feel offended and
we both want to go see it again. This movie is very well made.<br /><br />It should be stated that we find very few funny movies being made in
the past decade. The Hangover is a huge exception. This is a comedy
with creativity. I haven&#x27;t heard that much laughter in a theatre since
&#x22;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x22;. I imagine that movie also insulted some
people with some of its &#x22;vulgar humor&#x22;. <br /><br />The poster who said he felt he wasted $20 on the movie and the food he
bought at the theater has judgment that cannot be trusted. After all,
who spends that much on food at a movie theater?
