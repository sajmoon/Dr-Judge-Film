So this is my review of the Hangover. My older brothers and I had been
wanting to see this movie ever seen it came out in 2009 (two years
ago). But my oldest (17 year old) brother, still hadn&#x27;t seen this, went
with a friend to see Hangover Part 2. He liked it a whole lot and kept
talking about it, so, about a month later, it was very rainy outside,
so we did nothing but watch the t.v. We were going through the guide
and the first Hangover was going to come on in about an hour on
CineMax. My brothers and I still had not seen it. We were so excited.
The movie wouldn&#x27;t be half as good without Alan, Chow, or Mike Tyson.
(The nerdy hillbilly) Stu was a little funny but Alan is hilarious. I
think Phil is just cool. But I am not allowed to see Hangover Part 2
until it comes on DVD. But I asked my brother which Hangover was
better. He says they&#x27;re about the same. The IMDb rating is 7.9/10. I
have read a lot the user reviews and it looks like the rating should be
6.6. The Hangover Part 2 has a present rating of 6.9. But that could
change because it is still in theaters and there are stills more
reviews to come. Because of the user reviews (so far) looks like it
should be 5.9/10. Well, thats my opinion of the Award-Winning
&#x22;Hangover&#x22;.
