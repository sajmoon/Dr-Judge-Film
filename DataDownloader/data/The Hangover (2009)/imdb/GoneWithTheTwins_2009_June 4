Continuing the &#x22;Old School&#x22; tradition of adult comedies with immature
humor, The Hangover succeeds with a promising premise and several
inspired performances from its leads. While the plot&#x27;s creativity does
diminish at about the halfway mark and comparisons to lesser films of
the genre become more apparent, the R-rated laughs and hilariously
despicable misadventures of our gang of inebriated antiheroes maintains
a consistent pairing of riotous vulgarities and comical camaraderie in
desperation.<br /><br />Before Doug&#x27;s (Justin Bartha) wedding, his best friends Phil (Bradley
Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), along with the groom&#x27;s soon-to-be
brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis), plan a wild bachelor party in
Las Vegas. Upon awakening the next morning, Doug is missing and no one
can seem to remember the events that transpired the night before. An
abandoned baby, a missing tooth, a hospital tag, and a live tiger in
the bathroom are just a few of the clues the hungover group of misfits
must follow to find their friend and return home before the big day.<br /><br />The Hangover is off to a good start when the major players immediately
express their mismatched personalities and generally dysfunctional
problem-solving attitudes. Shaft and semen jokes within the first 10
minutes, an eye-flinching jockstrap flash and questionable social
mindsets also add to the roseate chaos to come. Although the story
isn&#x27;t entirely original, the premise is a nearly perfect setup for a
comedy, and it&#x27;s fitting that the rating doesn&#x27;t hinder the outrageous
levels of grossly immature and chiefly adult humor. Too bad the title
&#x22;What Happens in Vegas&#x22; was already taken by a softy romantic
chick-flick.<br /><br />The film has a suitable mix of serious predicaments tied into the crude
gags, brutal slapstick, the completely unexpected, hilariously coarse
language and (no longer) limits-pushing nudity (unfortunately mostly
male). This better balances the pacing of the film and grounds it in
reality a little more convincingly, even though it appears to
exaggerate out-of-control bachelor party scenarios - director Todd
Phillips is convinced that there are real party stories out there that
would make any element of The Hangover pale in comparison. With a
barbarous stun gun demonstration, a stolen police car, a misplaced
tiger, an unclaimed baby, Asian mobsters, Rain Man-gambling, and an
unplanned marriage, the film is like Harold and Kumar on ecstasy and
Saving Private Ryan in Vegas. It may not be the most groundbreaking
comedy, but following the drunken leads&#x27; exploits in reverse is a
formula for a great time.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins
