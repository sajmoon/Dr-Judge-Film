Oh my god! Just saw this tonight and it was true comedy genius.<br /><br />One of the funniest films I have ever seen and definitely the funniest
of the year.<br /><br />The cast are all fantastic in their roles, some of the cameos are
brilliant.<br /><br />Some of the stuff that happens in the film is just crazy and random but
it just makes it even funnier!<br /><br />If you see one comedy this year make it this one, you won&#x27;t regret
going to see it.<br /><br />Oh and make sure you watch the beginning of the credits and don&#x27;t walk
straight out, it&#x27;s really funny!
