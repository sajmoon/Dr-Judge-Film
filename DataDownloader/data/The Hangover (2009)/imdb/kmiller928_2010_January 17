After hearing all of the hype about this movie, I couldn&#x27;t wait to see
it. To hear a movie being touted as the &#x22;best reviewed comedy of the
year&#x22;, I was expecting a whole lot more than what I got. I have
actually watched this movie more than once to see if maybe I had just
missed something. I will admit, there were a few funny moments, but
when I hear people say they &#x22;laughed through the whole movie&#x22;, it truly
confuses me. I like to think of myself as someone who definitely has a
great sense of humor and I truly appreciate many forms of comedy. I
loved Old School, (also by Todd Phillips) but I don&#x27;t see that this
movie can even hold a candle to that flick. I found Ed Helms&#x27; acting to
be horrible and I actually found his character annoying. Many of the
jokes just fell flat. I really wanted to LOVE this movie, but that is
not the case. It&#x27;s not ALL bad... just not what I was hoping for.
