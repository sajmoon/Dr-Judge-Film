I just got back from viewing The Hangover, a movie I had never heard of
until yesterday when I saw a commerical on television and several
positive reviews. I&#x27;m really glad I saw this because I had so much fun.<br /><br />Of all the actors in the movie, they were all exceptional but the one
that really stood out and stole the show was definitely Zach
Galifanakis. Somehow I had not been familiar with his standup routine
but in this movie he was hilarious. It&#x27;s a heavily quotable movie and
95% of the quotes that are going to be repeated would be things that he
said. All four (or 3) of them worked together with so much chemistry,
actually having me believe at times that I&#x27;m watching real friends.<br /><br />The plot was totally absurd, but that was sort of the point. The
audience is in on the joke that we don&#x27;t even know what they possibly
could have done last night and it&#x27;s a great mystery to unravel every
tiny detail of it and laugh because it&#x27;s exceptionally bizarre.<br /><br />The only complaint I could have was that it started off a little slow,
like maybe the first 25 minutes until they wake up with The Hangover.
After that point, the laughs keep coming but the first quarter may
persuade people to walk straight out of the theater.<br /><br />This is without a doubt the funniest movie of the year and destined to
become a classic. What could beat it? Year One? The Proposal? Nah.
Maybe Funny People.
