I had been expecting The Hangover to be released in theatres here in
Peru for some time - the movie was ridiculously well-received in the
States, and it eventually became one of the most unexpectedly popular
movies of the year. Why it took so much time to arrive in Peru? God
only knows - or maybe the ones who have the distribution rights too -
but the fact of the matter is that, unlike other movies of its ilk, it
has arrived in Peruvian theatres, much for the delight of local movie
buffs and average Joes. And that&#x27;s because being a sort-of
&#x22;Independent&#x22; movie - yes, it was produced by a big studio, but it
features no big name &#x22;stars&#x22; and it was made with a pretty limited
budget - no one expected it to be as funny as other comedies featuring
more recognizable actors and inflated budgets. But it is. The Hangover
is decidedly hilarious - the funniest motion picture I&#x27;ve seen in the
last three years or so, actually.<br /><br />When I say The Hangover is the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen in recent
years, I really mean it. The whole point of the movie is to watch these
guys trying to remember what happened during their night of craziness,
looking for clues everywhere they can, interrogating people who seem to
have partied or done stuff with them, although they can&#x27;t remember
being with them. This leads to a whole lot of ridiculous and
over-the-top situations, which include -but are not limited to -
realizing that they got involved with some sort of crazy, gay Asian
gangster, that the tiger they stole - yes, stole - belonged to Mike
Tyson, or that Phil spend a portion of the night in the hospital. The
movie doesn&#x27;t provide with anything particularly outrageous - there&#x27;s
plenty of bodily fluids and profanity, although nothing that hasn&#x27;t
been seen before - but it is nevertheless hilarious because it knows
how to exploit its funniest bits without tiring the viewer.<br /><br />None of the principal actors are particularly well-known, but they
nevertheless seem to belong in this movie, playing these parts. Bradley
Cooper is great as Phil, portraying him as a sort of asshole who,
despite being what he is, can be likable from time to time. Ed Helms
plays the out-of-place nerd who discovers that he can be pretty wild
and crazy if he wants to - or if he has consumed enough alcohol - and
does it marvelously. The weirdest - and by far funniest - characters is
Alan, who as portrayed by Zach Galifianakis is definitely the most
memorable character in the film. His strange personality can lead to
some awkward situations - take the &#x22;blood brothers&#x22; oath for example -,
but also to some of the most hysterical situations I&#x27;ve seen in any
comedy. The Hangover ears its R rating by having some profanity and
showing a couple of bare, male buttocks - you know, male nudity always
seem to cause viewers to laugh - but it isn&#x27;t as shocking as other
films of its ilk. It doesn&#x27;t need to be. It only needs to be funny, and
it accomplishes this goal beautifully.<br /><br />I really wanted to see The Hangover, and now that I have done so, I
can&#x27;t say I was disappointed. Considering so many Hollywood comedies
nowadays fail to make me laugh simply because they are too stupid or
too derivative, it&#x27;s refreshing to watch a raunchy comedy that&#x27;s
actually funny. It also helps that its main characters, despite not
being particularly three-dimensional or realistic, are charismatic
enough for the audience to care for them. The movie laughs with these
guys, not at them, most of the time, and that&#x27;s why, despite having a
couple of stupid parts, it never really feels overly dumb. What can I
say? With some solid performances, hilarious gags and jokes and very
original premise - I really wonder why a &#x22;hangover&#x22; movie hadn&#x27;t been
done before, at least as effectively as this one -, The Hangover is an
stupendous comedy. It will hardly offend anyone, and it should make
most audiences cry with laughter.
