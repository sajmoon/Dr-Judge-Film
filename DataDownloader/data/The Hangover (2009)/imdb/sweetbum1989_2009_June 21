I went to go see this film about a week ago not long after it released
here in the UK and I have to admit I was expecting the usual comedy
where the best parts are in the trailer! That was not the case:<br /><br />The Hangover has got to be one of the funniest, well written and
comically genius movies of all time!! It will have you laughing from
beginning to end and if you don&#x27;t go see this you are definitely
missing out!! <br /><br />Everything that you want in a comedy you will get with this movie and
then some! I&#x27;m a big fan of eighties comedy when everything was new and
unseen so i rarely find todays comedies as funny but this film has made
it to the top of the list in my eyes and i will be very surprised if
anyone doesn&#x27;t love this movie as much as i do! it will definitely be
making it into my DVD collection and i may do something i hardly do...i
might go see it again at the cinemas!<br /><br />Amazing! Brilliant! Just when you think you&#x27;ve seen it all in comedy
&#x27;The Hangover&#x27; blows everything out of the water!
