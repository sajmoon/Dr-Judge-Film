How Out Of Control Can Bachelor Parties Get? This Film Answers That
Question With A Big Full Stop. I Saw This Film In Cinema&#x27;s &#x26; Never
Commented On It. The Plot Is That 4 Guys Go To Vegas But On The Night
They Forget Anything That Happened On That Night &#x26; Encounter A Tiger In
The Bathroom, Someone Has A Missing Tooth, That Same Person Getting
Married, A Stolen Cop Car, Someone Missing, A Naked Chinese Man In The
Trunk Of Their Original Car That Sounds Like Some Weird Bachelor Party
To Me. You Get A Lot Of Cameo&#x27;s From Famous Actors Like Mike Tyson Or
Heather Graham. I Only Give This Comedy A 7 Because Its Hard To Believe
They Can Fit All Of That Into 12 Hours But Still Its Enjoyable If You
Want A Good Ol&#x27; Laugh With Your Friends I Showed This To My Friends &#x26;
They Were Laughing From The Moment With The Tiger To The Pool Thing
With Alan (I Won&#x27;t Go Into Details). This Is Enjoyable As It Gets For
Recent Original Comedies.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10
