Judging from the trailer I thought this film would be pretty funny. I
was wrong. It was HILARIOUS. I have never laughed so hard in a theater,
never heard other people laugh so hard in the theater. There was almost
so much laughter that I actually wished people would be quiet because I
knew we were missing more jokes while waiting for the laughter from the
previous joke to die down.<br /><br />The part with the masturbating baby was ridiculously funny, and the
face the baby was making was just priceless. I&#x27;m pretty much to the
point where I think Zach Galifianakis can do no wrong. I saw his
&#x22;Comedy Central Presents&#x22; several years ago and was hooked. I am so
glad he&#x27;s doing as well as he is.<br /><br />Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong were all great
in this film. I love the fact that none of these guys are &#x22;superstars&#x22;
yet could still carry this film beautifully. This just goes to show you
that Hollywood should be focusing on stories instead of &#x22;star power&#x22;.
