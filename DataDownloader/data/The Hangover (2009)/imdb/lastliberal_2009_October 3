There isn&#x27;t anyone in this movie that I would ever say I wanted to see
in a movie. The entire cast is completely unknown, so I can&#x27;t have any
preconceptions.<br /><br />Of course, it did get a lot of Teen Choice nominations, which would
make it a movie I wouldn&#x27;t go near except it may possibly make it on
the expanded Best Picture list next year, so I have to sorta watch it.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie were the supporting cast: the wedding
chapel manager, the cops (Ken Jeong &#x26; Cleo King), the doctor (Matt
Walsh), the naked Japanese guy, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the tiger. There
was not one funny moment involving the main characters except for the
escape in the cop car.
