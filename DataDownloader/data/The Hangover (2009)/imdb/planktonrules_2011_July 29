I felt so out of touch with everyone when I got around to seeing this
film. After all, it has a very respectable score on IMDb and a lot of
folks seemed to like it--yet I found it about as enjoyable as dental
surgery. Part of the problem might be that I only watched it because I
was bored and on a cruise ship with a very limited selection of DVDs.
Part of it might be because the day before (also out of boredom) I
watched &#x22;Hot Tub Time Machine&#x22;--and it was practically the same film.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a story about four completely unlikable guys who seem
more like caricatures than anyone you&#x27;d ever meet. In addition, they
were so unlike each other you wonder if such friendships ever exist
anywhere but in a Hollywood film. One is the guy who is about to get
married--and wants to screw some hookers before he ties the knot (how
heart-warming). One is a handsome school teacher who is just nasty and
100% unlikable. One is a screw-up and idiot--so they naturally make him
the fat guy. And, the other is the man in a relationship with a
castrating female. If these sound familiar, they were pretty much the
same characters you&#x27;d see in &#x22;Hot Tub Time Machine&#x22;--but even more
one-dimensional and this is especially true for the last two characters
I mentioned. They go to Vegas, accidentally ingest some of the date
rape drug and do lots of insane things--little of which is particularly
funny. And this is the problem with the film. If you laugh at very
low-brow humor, don&#x27;t mind that the plot makes no sense (such as the
tasering scene) and think that a dirty word is THE punchline for most
jokes, then you&#x27;ll enjoy the film. As for me, I can enjoy a dopey film
(such as &#x22;Talladega Nights&#x22; or &#x22;Strange Brew&#x22;)--but there is a limit to
dopiness. Plus, it&#x27;s hard to stick with a movie when you simply don&#x27;t
care what happens to any of them. Overall, over-rated unlike any recent
movie I have seen. Unpleasant, unfunny and for the undemanding.
