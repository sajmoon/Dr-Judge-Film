Greetings again from the darkness. Old School director Todd Phillips
takes us to Vegas. Justin Bartha (National Treasure) is getting married
in a couple of days and his friends Ed Helms (The Office) and Bradley
Cooper (Wedding Crashers) decide a road trip bachelor party to sin city
is a good call. Justin&#x27;s off kilter, soon to be brother in law, the
incredible Zach Galifianakis, joins them as well.<br /><br />The next morning the three of them wake up in a trashed hotel suite
with a chicken, tiger and no sign of Justin. Comedy ensues as they try
to re-create the events of the previous evening through various clues
... such as a stolen police car being brought up from valet.<br /><br />Ed Helms is very good, but much of the comedy comes from Zach G. He has
a bit of early John Belushi to him, thanks to the heft and delivery.
More importantly, he is not predictable in the least.<br /><br />Mike Tyson, who shows up for his tiger, adds quite the offbeat element,
especially while singing Phil Collins ... wow. Rachael Harris is
perfect as the bossy girlfriend to Helms and their showdown near the
end is a winning moment. Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong and Heather Graham
all have their moments, but unlike the previews, I won&#x27;t give anything
else away.<br /><br />If you like Old School, this comedy is in your wheelhouse.
