I&#x27;ve never laugh so hard &#x26; for such a sustained long period of time
during a movie except for this one! The 4 guys are great friends but
each have their own idiosyncrasy &#x26; different ways of having outrageous
silly fun &#x26; dealing with preposterous problems... just imagine, after
their hangover, Stu can&#x27;t recall how he lost his tooth, Phil has no
idea why he has a hospital tag around his wrist, Alan has become more
socially awkward &#x26; Doug the bridegroom has gone missing! Nobody
remembers what actually happened &#x26; each is clueless why they have a
baby in their possession &#x26; a live tiger lurking in their hotel suite&#x27;s
bathroom... the story plot offers plenty of absolute fun and hilarity.
Do try not to leave before the credits end as there are side-splitting
photo-shots awaiting for you to laugh your way out of the cinema even
long after the movie ends... please go watch it with a relaxed mind as
it can be a virtue to be able to laugh at ourselves &#x26; others as they
provide us as mirrors for our own reflections in life.... indeed,
laughter is a good medicine!
