Firstly as The Hangover is basically &#x22;Blotto Memento&#x22;, and unfolds back
to front I can&#x27;t give ya too much in the way of plot.<br /><br />I will tell you things I thought prior to watching the movie:<br /><br />1/ In advance of the movie starting I had set the over/under of gay
jokes at 5. And I had the over. (I was close but wrong. Although the
first 2 gay jokes come in the first couple minutes.)<br /><br />2/ I saw Heather Graham&#x27;s name in the credits and thought that
exponentially increases the chance of seeing boobies. (Again only sorta
right, not sure breastfeeding counts.)<br /><br />3/ This seems to want to be quotable. (The jury is out, I for one can&#x27;t
think of much that I would regurgitate in social situations.<br /><br />4/ This one from my wife, &#x22;Bradley Cooper is Ben Affleck hot.&#x22; Now I
know my wife so sadly I know this is supposed to be a compliment - not
sure Cooper would agree.<br /><br />Now the limited things I can say without giving too much away:<br /><br />The boys leave for a Buck&#x27;s party in the days prior to the wedding.
Zach Galihhjgajsdfjgbjksbdjhikis (sp?) is the standard ring-in-relo
that is almost always in attendance, everyone has met him multiple
times but no-one really remembers him.<br /><br />Quick question, why a buck&#x27;s party so close to the wedding and why
could such an apparently cool guy only have two friends and a relo that
would want to go? As a guy I would consider that poor form, any
reasonable guy needs a couple days recovery time from a good buck&#x27;s
party.<br /><br />The jittery bride is told on the phone that the wedding ain&#x27;t going
ahead as planned, then the wavy lines appear (in our minds) and we go
into flashback mode.<br /><br />The Hangover basically starts when three of our four lead characters
awake after a &#x22;rough&#x22; night celebrating a bachelor party. In their
$4,200 per night villa are the ingredients that over the film provide
most of the laughs and help explain just &#x22;what the hell happened last
night?&#x22;<br /><br />A Tiger A Chicken A Missing tooth A Baby A Hospital tag A Mattress on
roof A Cop car in their hotel bay<br /><br />All of which are explained fully... aside from the chicken. Seriously,
what happened to the chicken? I really hope there is an explanation in
the sequel explaining the chicken&#x27;s existence. Why? Why? Why? Was it to
feed the tiger?<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the things that keep me awake at night&#x85;<br /><br />Anyway it wasn&#x27;t the hilarious, quotable laff riot I half expected
going in, it was a pretty funny 90 minutes with some memorable scenes:<br /><br />Getting out of a night in prison. Finding a random naked guy in the car
boot. Meeting Mike Tyson<br /><br />Zach Galikjuhkgcvksvdckhvsjikis (sp again?) is suitably random and
apparently wasted-without-being-wasted at all times. But not as
randomly hilarious as described in other reviews by any stretch.<br /><br />Bradley &#x22;Affleck&#x22; Cooper is the most rational and realistic of the
three, while he is still a w**ker at times he is no more a w**ker than
a myriad real-life guys that I have encountered at various Buck&#x27;s
parties and gents events.<br /><br />And as far as the dentist-guy and his b*tch girlfriend goes, no man
should ever be as whipped as he is, and no comeuppance could be drastic
enough to teach her a lesson. (I am not being sexist, everyone should
have the right to a 50/50 relationship, and if they choose to have a
60/40 or a 70/30 and both parties agree so be it. The chick in this
film is a total b*tch and needs a flogging.)<br /><br />Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 / 10. Humorous but by no means hilarious. Will
however be deemed an immediate classic by those still too young to have
forged their own drunk stories. (God willing their time will come and
this won&#x27;t be as &#x22;far out&#x22;.)<br /><br />If you liked this (or even if you didn&#x27;t) try oneguyrambling.com
