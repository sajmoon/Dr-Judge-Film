THE HANGOVER There was going to be a marriage ceremony between Doug
Billings and Tracy Garner. Dough and his two other friends Stu and Phil
and Tracy&#x27;s brother Alan decided to go on a trip to Las Vegas. Alan
Garners Tracy&#x27;s brother always acted like a kid whiles Stu had a wife
who always gave him a hell of a time and never liked him to hang out
with friends and Phil a high school teacher liked to act like his
students when he was out on trips. The theme was basically based on
some issues people faced after having so much fun and too much drinking
and was also based on comedy. In the movie Stu, Alan and Phil
encountered and issue where they woke up to not find Dough in the hotel
room and had to look for him. They were so knocked out that they didn&#x27;t
remember what had happened earlier on. Alan and the guys woke up to
find a chicken in their room running around and Mike Tyson&#x27;s tiger in
their bathroom. In a scene, Mike Tyson came looking for the friends and
knocked Alan out after seeing them on his security cameras. References
in the movie were so much based on what happened. Stu and the rest of
the guys in search of Doug kept on asking themselves what just happen.
They were so knocked out that they never realized a single moment of
the night and anywhere they went in search of Dough everyone will ask
them don&#x27;t you remember all this? The angle they shot the movie was in
proportion to the detail of the scene. They were able to really make
sense and actually communicate to audiences. Also the movie not shot on
premises actually had enough lighting for anyone to believe it was
actually shot location. Even at night they were able to produce enough
lighting to actually look like Vegas. The theme actually explained
itself in the movie
