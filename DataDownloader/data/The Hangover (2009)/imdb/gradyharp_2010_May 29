THE HANGOVER apparently swept the country, touted as the funniest film
ever made. And indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that
THE HANGOVER 2 is in post-production. So there is more on the way. The
question arises, &#x27;more what?&#x27; Apparently resting on the information
gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies
like &#x27;Borat&#x27; etc., there is an audience for films that pose middle aged
men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in
their misbegotten teens. It is amazing that these films that put down
African Americans (like the manipulation of Mike Tyson and the dumb
drug dealer character &#x27;Black Doug&#x27; portrayed by Mike Epps) and Asian
Americans (like the foolish over-the-top fop of &#x27;Mr Chow&#x27; by Jen Keong,
etc etc etc are not confronted. But then it may appear that all is fair
in cinema &#x27;comedy&#x27;. <br /><br />The premise is that four friends go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party
before the wedding of the most mild of them all. Bradley Cooper (a
teacher), Ed Helms (a dentist), Zach Galifianakis (the obese mentally
disturbed brother of the bride) and Justin Bartha (the groom to be)
spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an
hotel suite with a chicken, a tiger, a mess, hangovers and amnesia, and
a missing groom. The remainder of the film is simple the antics of
these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right
some infractions of behavior. Is that funny? Well, apparently to the
vast number of people who see this film it is. So here comes the next
installment in what will likely be a long line of gross-out sequels.
Meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion. To this
we&#x27;ve come? <br /><br />Grady Harp
