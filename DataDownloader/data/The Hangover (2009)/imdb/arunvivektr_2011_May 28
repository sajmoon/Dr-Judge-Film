First of all I do not like that much of American comedy movies. I only
watch regional comedy movies which have &#x27;clean&#x27; comedies and nice
dialogs and all.. Some English Humor movies that I watched was hell
like tragedy... But I liked this one. Nice dialogs, situations,
surprises and a great climax. What more do you want a movie like this?
The casting is superb, Very good direction and especially the
soundtracks are greater than ever. The events are its beauty. It really
tempts you not to go out of the cinema even at the interval. Its not a
family type of movie. It is the one your mom is warning you about. But
you know what it gives us the real pleasure of it. If you once watched
this you will watch this at least two more times. It was with my
friends that I watched this movie. We were expected a limed comedy
thriller and what we got was real pain in the stomach by laughing.
After the movie we were talking nothing but about it until bed.<br /><br />Some of them had an opinion that it will be better to avoid that much
vulgarity from it. But I am quiet sure that it will kill the fun of it.
So for any normal conservative Indian guy It is not the movie you want
to go with the family and have a nice dinner there after. It is a movie
that You go with your friend, laugh like hell, make some noise, thrill
with fun and have a beer with.<br /><br />It is like the traditional Indian in me is freaking out, shamelessly
scolding it but the man in me slaps it and saying &#x22;this is what you
need &#x22;. Yeah I agrees it this is a once in lifetime movie for us!!!
What more?<br /><br />It&#x27;s Classic!!!
