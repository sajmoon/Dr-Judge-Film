I judge the quality of a film comedy by how much it makes me laugh. I
think I laughed exactly twice during the entire running time of &#x22;The
Hangover.&#x22; I was a willing subject. I wanted to like this film after
hearing the endless praise others have heaped on it. I sat waiting for
the jokes to land. And waited. And waited.<br /><br />I heard more than one person say that they never see movies, but they
saw this one and loved it. That should have been my first warning that
it wasn&#x27;t going to be that good. It&#x27;s jokes are so obvious and
ordinary. There are a bunch of stock characters -- the fat schlubby
guy, the nerdy uptight guy, the alpha male -- and a bevy of tired jokes
built around things like breast feeding and naked guys.<br /><br />I guess I missed the memo that straight males are supposed to find the
sight of another guy&#x27;s naked ass the most hilarious thing ever.<br /><br />Grade: B-
