There isn&#x27;t a real flaw in this movie! It&#x27;s great comedy. I had to
laugh a lot! This isn&#x27;t one of the movies which are simply too silly to
be funny. Even though it&#x27;s comedy, this is no stupid movie at all!
Great conversations, a great and unusual story - with lots of
surprises. Yeah yeah, of course, a lot is predictable once you
understood the logic of the movie, still, it&#x27;s great fun! And the most
fun are all the crazy characters in this movie.<br /><br />So why didn&#x27;t I give this movie 9, or 10 points? - The main reason is
probably, that I prefer different kind of movies. I like movies that
try to teach you something, or movies that move you emotionally in an
extreme way. Visuals and the music are very important for that. In this
movie, visuals and the music hasn&#x27;t been impressive at all. And beside,
I did laugh harder in other movies. Even though, this movie might be in
the top 20 of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
