I wasn&#x27;t going to watch this movie because normally films of this type
are an utter waste of time.<br /><br />However, After a few minutes, it caught my interest and I ended up
watching the whole thing.<br /><br />It wasn&#x27;t rolling on the ground funny but it was outrageous and
interesting enough to draw me in and make me want to see the ultimate
conclusion.<br /><br />I could identify with the characters and have had a few Vegas nights
where I woke up wondering where the heck my pants were.<br /><br />To the naysayers... if you are looking for something witty and
cerebral...forget it..just relax and enjoy the silliness.
