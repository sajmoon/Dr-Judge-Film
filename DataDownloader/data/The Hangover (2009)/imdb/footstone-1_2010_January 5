Some parts were funny. I found myself cracking up but I think it could
have been done a lot better. A little far-fetched and silly at times.
The acting was alright. I don&#x27;t think it flowed well and the editing
left much to be desired. The chicken in the room was funny but the
whole thing with Mike Tyson was over-the-top. He&#x27;s not funny nor that
whole segment. The Chinese gang angle was funny. The climax of the
movie was terrible. That should have been thought out more. But then
again, I&#x27;m just a reviewer and making movies is hard and it&#x27;s a tough
business. Overall, I enjoyed it but I think it could have been thought
out a little better. It had the potential to be a classic but fell
short. Maybe the producers were pressed for time.
