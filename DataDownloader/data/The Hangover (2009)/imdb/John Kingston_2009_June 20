I read a review in USA Today comparing this movie with &#x22;Three Men and a
Baby&#x22;. Hey, I thought, I liked 3 men and a baby, I&#x27;ll go to see this.<br /><br />BIIIIG mistake. You have to look very, very hard for similarities
between those two films. This was much more in the style of &#x22;Road
Trip&#x22;, or for those old enough to remember them, the &#x22;American Pie&#x22;
films.<br /><br />I have to say, the acting was pretty good. Some of the characters are
intended to be unlikeable, and boy did I dislike them. Trouble was, I
found I had almost no interest in whether they succeeded or failed in
their mission. And the events that unfolded in the film were meant to
be increasingly outrageous, but I just found them increasingly beyond
belief. <br /><br />Forget about the baby. This is about three men being juvenile. The
so-called humour comes in watching them suffer. Ha-ha-not.
