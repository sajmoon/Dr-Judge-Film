The Hangover<br /><br />For those of you who are looking for a low-brow summer comedy with
offensive jokes relating to babies, overweight men, testicles, drugs,
hookers, strippers, immigrants, dentists, Las Vegas, and Mike Tyson
than &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is the right movie for you. Directed by Todd
Phillips of &#x27;Old School&#x27; fame, he brings back classic characters from
his claim to fame; the infamous wedding singer returns as well as the
guy looking for the &#x27;gang bang&#x27;; to shed light on the history of this
genre of comedy that some producers and audiences can&#x27;t get enough of.
This movie is no exception, it pushes the limitations of its audience
with its humor, both physical and verbal, from the hilarious mannerisms
of Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to great writing and pacing of a night that
nobody can remember. <br /><br />It all starts with a wedding, followed by a flashback which begins with
the bachelors Alan, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and the
groom to be Doug (Justin Bartha) driving to Las Vegas for one last
night of fun at Caesar&#x27;s Palace. Each character carries excess baggage
with them (Phil is looking to escape his mundane life as a teacher,
husband, and father; Stu is dating a possessive woman that monitors his
every move; Alan is a hazard to be around in general; and Doug is
getting married). Their plan is to just have fun and forget about where
they came from and this comes back to them full circle because they get
drugged before the night begins and can&#x27;t remember any of the events
that took place or where to find Doug. This is the premise for the
film, but the flashbacks are limited to security tapes and photos that
act as the refresher for the three remaining members. <br /><br />They go on a wild goose chase to a hospital, wedding chapel, sketchy
motel, police precinct, impound lot, casino floor, and the dessert
looking for Doug. They encounter doctors, police officers, strippers, a
baby, a tiger, Mike Tyson, and a Chinese dignitary. But all of this is
a blur to them and they make fools of themselves in the process trying
to piece the night together, but it is all in vain as the trio only
puts together a time-line of events and can&#x27;t decipher when are where
their friend disappeared. They make fun of themselves, each other,
those around them, and by those around them along the way; bringing to
life their personalities and giving hope to solving their problems back
home along the way which adds to the humor of the storyline. <br /><br />Each character has their own subliminal conquest when entering Las
Vegas, they don&#x27;t solve it when they leave but living through the night
of their lives sheds light on their current situation causing each of
them to appreciate the things that they have, or don&#x27;t have, even more
when they go back home. In their attempt for a night of fun they
overcome their backgrounds and are considered equals when it comes to
their memory. While searching for their friend they learn things about
themselves that weren&#x27;t quite clear prior to their trip and are able to
bring all of their past problems to the surface. However, no real
solution is devised for any of them or their problems, but they return
to California changed men for the better. <br /><br />&#x27;The Hangover&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as a comedy or and coming of age
story,as it gets played out as. Rather, look at the film as a guidebook
for what goes into a man&#x27;s head. Not everyone has experienced a night
like this, nor will many have a chance at it, so use the film as a
vehicle to explore the unknown and take notes on what one should and
should not do along the way. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to spoil the ending so I&#x27;ll cut myself off here and leave
you with a plea to see the movie with an open mind and a plan. The open
mind will make the jokes more amusing, especially since they all come
out of nowhere. The plan is for how you can avoid these situations with
future bachelor parties or trips to Las Vegas. If nothing else see this
movie so you know what to avoid when experiencing one of these two.
