Two days before his wedding with the wealthy Tracy Garner (Sasha
Barrese), Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) travels to his bachelor party
in Las Vegas with his best friends, the school teacher Phil Wenneck
(Bradley Cooper) and the dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Tracy&#x27;s
unconventional brother Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis). Tracy&#x27;s father
lends his convertible Mercedez Benz that is his pride and joy to Doug
with many recommendations. The quartet rents the best suite in the
Caesar&#x27;s Palace and they go to the roof to celebrate. Alan proposes a
toast to Doug and they drink his booze. On the next morning, Phil, Stu
and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last
night; the room is upside down; Doug is missing; there is a baby in the
wardrobe; a tiger in the bedroom; a chicken in the room; Stu has a
missing tooth; and Doug is missing. The trio tries to track down last
night to find what happened and sooner they discover that Stu married
the stripper Jade (Heather Graham) and Alan has spiked their booze with
&#x22;Good Morning, Cinderella&#x22; in the beginning of their crazy night. <br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a hilarious comedy that slightly recalls the
situations and pace of &#x22;Mystery Date&#x22;. The story is very funny and the
screenplay is unpredictable and full of action. There are many joke and
witty lines, and all the characters are likable even the bad guys.
Where they got that chicken is an unanswered question? I only regret
that the director did not show a scene with Tracy&#x27;s father seeing his
Mercedez. This is the type of movie recommended for a Friday night
after working along the whole week &#x96; the entertainment and laughs are
guaranteed. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Se Beber, N&#xE3;o Case&#x22; (&#x22;If You Drink, Do not Marry&#x22;)
