The Hangover is truly funny. But it is better than funny.<br /><br />First there is the plot: friends wake up in a hotel room and can&#x27;t
remember a thing. But although this is quite good already, it is only
the starting point. What is truly funny, and truly creative, is their
subsequent quest: there is a wealth of original ideas, of unexpected
things, in all 2x or 3x more material and ideas than is found in your
average flick.<br /><br />And, the acting is quite good, perfect for this kind of film. No one is
THE star, no one takes themselves too seriously.<br /><br />&#x27;nuff said. Go watch it!
