Sometimes the title of a film can sell itself, or at the very least
pique a viewer&#x27;s interest. Director Todd Phillip&#x27;s new comedy The
Hangover does this and more by introducing an infinitely relatable
premise and infusing it with a clever story to keeps the gimmick
supported for the duration. While providing the requisite raunch,
stupidity and laughs, The Hangover is bolstered more by its puzzle
piece narrative then by straight up humour. The mark of a good comedy
is one that can keep your interest in between the laughs; be it by
human drama, character development or in this case, a meandering
riddle.<br /><br />What do we really know about a hangover? We know we have one, and we
know we drank too much. Often everything before, after and in-between
can be a blur at best, and for three friends, Phil, Stu and Alan they
certainly got the worst. Travelling to Las Vegas for a night of sin,
gin and wins to celebrate their friend Doug&#x27;s (Justin Bartha) bachelor
party they awaken the next morning to find their hotel room a tad
dishevelled, a tiger in their bathroom, their memories wiped clean and
their groom to be MIA. Playing the three worried bros respectively are
Bradley Cooper as the bored-with-his-life school teacher, Ed Helms as
the neurotic dentist and Zach Galifanakis as the awkward weirdo and
soon to be brother in law of Doug. So unfolds the mystery; trying to
find their missing friend before the wedding by piecing together the
clues of their epic night out.<br /><br />For me the standout of the group was certainly Ed Helms. He plays the
role straight, he is likable and he is funny. His characters arc is the
most complete and entertaining and he certainly grounds his wilder
counterparts nicely. The other players are certainly funny, yet the
characters of Phil and Alan are not fully likable. Cooper&#x27;s Phil is a
bit of a prick and Alan is flat out creepy. That aside the actors put
forward such commendable efforts all is soon forgotten and the quick
pace and continual humour keeps things fast, fun and frantic.<br /><br />As promised by the trailers, we get a cameo from the Mike Tyson who is
funnier for being himself then for his actual performance, darting in
an out with a great supporting performance is heather Graham as an
escort and Mike Epps makes good use of his time as quote &#x27;Black Doug&#x27;.
More hilarious yet is a closing cover for rapper 50 Cents&#x27; Candy Shop
which is as inspired as it is hilarious. The Hangover is certainly one
of those comedies that is re-watchable, and likely to improve with
repeat viewings. However it is probably a good thing actual hangovers
are not this much fun; I&#x27;d rather die of laughter then alcohol
poisoning.<br /><br />Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com
