&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is by far the funniest movie of 2009.A person took me to
the movies for my birthday last year and she suggested Hannah Montana -
I was like no way see &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;.I I had to see this movie when i
saw the trailer.The whole audience cried so hard with laughter when i
went to see it at the cinema All the main characters were excellent in
this movie and my favorite character is Alan Garner played by Zach.I
think I laughed the hardest with all the scenes he was in it.II laugh
so hard I cry every time I watch this movie and I have seen it many
times.It is very funny from the beginning to the end.It is definitely
crude.It has a lot of random one liners.No matter how many times I will
watch this movie it is never going to get old.One of the most funniest
movies I have ever seen.A must see comedy.Is looking forward to &#x22;The
Hangover 2&#x22; which I wonder will it top the &#x22;The Hangover 1&#x22;? No wonder
why this is the best selling comedy DVD of all time.Definitely one of
my most favorite comedy movies.<br /><br />10/10 is my rating
