Doug Billings(Justin Barthia)and Tracy Garner(Sasha Barrese)are about
to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men have a
bachelor party with Doug&#x27;s two best buddies Phil Wenneck (Bradley
Cooper)and Stu Price (Ed Garner), and Tracy&#x27;s brother Alan Garner (Zach
Galifianakis) - hop into Tracy&#x27;s father&#x27;s beloved Mercedes convertible
for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. SPhil, a married high school
teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he&#x27;s with his
pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his
controlling girlfriend Melissa(Rachael Harris) think, because she
disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals. Stu has to lie to her
about the stag, telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour
in the Napa Valley.Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her,
against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be
unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world.<br /><br />The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their
hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened
in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain
things are in the suite that shouldn&#x27;t be, and certain things that
should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the
latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using
only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a
journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what
happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as
if they can&#x27;t find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have
to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even
worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t remember the last comedy I&#x27;ve seen at the movies that has made
me laugh out loud more then any other has in a very long time. The
screenplay by Jon Lucas, Scott Moore, Todd Phillips, Jeremy Garelick is
outrageously clever from beginning to end and laugh your ass off
hilarious that&#x27;s also a little raunchy and at times a little
disturbing. The cast especially help boost the film with great comedic
timing and delivery with memorable one-liners.Although the standout of
them all has got to be Zach Galifianakis(Alan Garner) with his
hilarious humor and physicality he brings the character that literally
steals the show ever time he&#x27;s on the screen. But that&#x27;s only the
beginning stay after the movie ends and the show all the hilarious and
provocative pictures taking on that night is one of the best parts of
the movie. The cast also includes some cameos most noticeable Mike
Tyson,and Wayne Newton,Carrot Top found in the photo slides at the end
credits.<br /><br />So overall The Hangover is an instant classic,not only is it the best
comedy of the year its one the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.Get ready to
laugh your ass off. No doubt I&#x27;ll be going to see the sequel that is
planned but I&#x27;m also having mixed reactions for it. While I did notice
some points in this story in the end that they could use for the sequel
but my worry would be that it could be like watching the first but
slightly different and mostly unoriginal, but we&#x27;ll just have to what
and see in 2011.<br /><br />Movie Grade:A+ Review by Doug Nau
