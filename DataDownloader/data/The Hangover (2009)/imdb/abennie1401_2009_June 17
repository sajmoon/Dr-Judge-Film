I actually made an account just to review this movie, because it was
one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve ever seen, and I&#x27;ve seen Superbad :P
So, the humour is top-drawer. Sure it&#x27;s very crude, and even slap stick
in some places, but that just makes the film so much funnier. The 3
main characters, (not including Doug) have great chemistry with each
other, both in acting and comedy, and the side characters like the two
crazy police officers, and the Gay Chinese Mobster were simply quality.<br /><br />All in all, it was &#xA3;6.25 thats was well spent. The storyline was
excellent, subtly combining many classic comedies to enhance the
already fantastic quality storyline and humour. Hats off to the script
writers, the director and the cast, for a simply hilarious movie.<br /><br />Watch It. ASAP.
