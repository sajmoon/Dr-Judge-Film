This movie has been done to death. Bachelor Party, Bachelor Party In
Vegas, The Groomsmen etc. etc. etc. You know what , this film worked.
It did not pretend to be a deep movie with a script you had to graduate
from an Ivy League School to understand. This was just a silly movie,
with silly antics and funny gags and predicaments. There was a lot of
originality in this film. It was hilariously funny from start to
finish. Fine acting and even finer screenplay. One lost groom with his
3 knucklehead friends trying to piece together what happened. This film
was one of the funniest films of all time and well worth anyones time.
Somehow Mike Tyson was worked into this film and even his couple of
scenes were outstanding. Some supporting characters along the way, most
notably sexy Heather Graham and an even funnier Chinese gentleman that
stole a scene or 2. The hangover from this one will be most pleasant.
