This is really very funny, provided that you like shock humor, crude
humor, situational humor, ridiculous circumstances, etc. I didn&#x27;t even
think the preview I saw looked that funny, so I was surprised when the
story got underway and I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing. The main characters&#x27;
personalities vary so much that much of the comedy too comes from the
quirky character traits they have - and how that causes each of them to
react differently the absurd situations they have gotten themselves
into. This R-rated comedy is a nice departure from the films of Judd
Apatow or the comedies of Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler. I&#x27;m not saying
I don&#x27;t like those other guys, but sometimes it seems like those are
the main comedy options (along with romantic comedies or family
comedies). Well, here&#x27;s a new, original, hilarious comedy. Loved it!
