I&#x27;m surprised to see that this movie rates 8.0 at the time I&#x27;m writing
this. Not surprising is that &#x27;Aged under 18&#x27; gave the highest scores,
because that&#x27;s the perfect target group for this kind of movie. If you
haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of good comedies in your life yet, this will
be funny. However, if you&#x27;ve seen more movies, it will be all too
obvious that the main ingredients of this movie are derivative and/or
cheap.<br /><br />The &#x27;doctor/dentist&#x27; gag comes straight out of Wild Hogs for instance,
and many of the other situations come from other movies which in most
cases did a better job at it. For someone who has watched &#x27;Fear &#x26;
Loathing In Las Vegas&#x27;, it feels like the makers of this movie wanted
to duplicate the hotel suite scene but were too chicken (pun intended)
to do actual damage to their film set. When the humor isn&#x27;t derivative,
it often stoops down to puerile level instead.<br /><br />This is a &#x27;trailer movie&#x27;: the best parts are in the trailer and the
rest is mostly filler. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: it&#x27;s not terrible as a
whole. As a kind of remix of existing movies it was entertaining enough
not to get me bored. It just doesn&#x27;t deserve the 10 or even 8 stars
many people give it. 6/10 seems much more reasonable.
