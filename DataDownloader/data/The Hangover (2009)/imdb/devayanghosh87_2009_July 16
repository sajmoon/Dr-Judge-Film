I must say I&#x27;m a big fan of Todd Philip movies ,every movie he makes
has got something new and different to offer so was expecting nothing
less from HANGOVER but surprisingly this one surpasses all his previous
movies.Bradley copper has perfectly played his part of a person trying
to bring the situation under control by any means,Zack has been
immensely funny so has been the other characters ,everyone played their
part perfectly.The casino scene was hilarious and the one in police
station too falls under &#x22; one of the funniest.The background score was
properly done.Even the &#x22;candy shop&#x22; song too strikes a cord with the
audience.so i suggest everyone to go to your nearest cinema hall and
get yourself a ticket, i assure you that you wont be disappointed.
