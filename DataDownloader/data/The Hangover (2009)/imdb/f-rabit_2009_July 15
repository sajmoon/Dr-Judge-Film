As everybody was saying that this movie is great, i decided to check
the rating on IMDb. Uau! (8.5) there&#x27;s no chance (I thought!) of
getting bored at the theater. So I didn&#x27;t even blink when i suggested
it to my friends on a Friday night, so sure i was about the real good
time we would spend laughing our eyes out! The movies begins, and with
it the first disappointment: retrospective guided! We saw the end when
it had nearly began. No suspense at all... Then, nothing
happened...just a bunch of jerk offs doing stupid things and the worse:
no fun! no laughs! nobody laughed at all! zero! (the only half fun
scene was the one where the chicken appears behind someone&#x27;s head lying
on the floor). I honestly can&#x27;t understand how someone enjoyed this
movie; and how is it possible to rate it with 10! absolutely
ridiculous! I&#x27;d rather watch &#x22;the monster of black lagoon&#x22; 10 times in
a row than this one only once!
