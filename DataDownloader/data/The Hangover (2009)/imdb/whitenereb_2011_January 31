The Hangover has got to be one the funniest movies to come out. Between
the dirty humor and the constant stupidity, it had everyone cracking
up. <br /><br />The movie is mostly about these four guys who set out to go to Las
Vegas for their buddy&#x27;s bachelor party and end up losing him. They
spend the whole movie looking for him, because they have no memory of
what happened, hence the movie name the hangover. <br /><br />I mostly enjoyed this movie because it keeps people my age super
entertained, and excited for the next one they come out with. In my
mind there will never be a funny movie to beat this one, and there
isn&#x27;t one that even comes close to touching the fantastic acting played
in this movie.<br /><br />I would recommend that everyone see this movie, once they reach the
appropriate age.
