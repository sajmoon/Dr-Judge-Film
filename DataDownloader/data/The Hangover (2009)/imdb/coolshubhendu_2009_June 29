Awesome movie.Go see it.This is the funniest,craziest,wittiest movie I
have ever seen.I have seen it yesterday once,the first time.<br /><br />But I feel will see it at least 5-6 times more.I heard from my friends
that it is a good movie but it turned out to be one of the best in its
genre. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews
would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the
iceberg.<br /><br />I especially liked Zach Galifianakis.He was simply superb through out
the movie.And hats off to Todd Philips for directing such a brilliant
flick.We are all eagerly waiting for the sequel Todd.
