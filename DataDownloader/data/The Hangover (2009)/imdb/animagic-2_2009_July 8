2009_July 8 
I am probably the only one who was attracted to this film more or less
solely because of the high production values. It looks nicer than any
other comedy I&#x27;ve seen and although that&#x27;s what made me go and see it,
it isn&#x27;t what I remembered most.<br /><br />The best of this film is all in the characters, they are just naturally
entertaining (i.e. fat Jesus) and the film actually has a few good
visual gags (including an hilarious director cameo) which is rare
nowadays. Overall it is a quality film that is at the very least solid,
the only reason why you will be disappointed is if you&#x27;re expecting the
best film eve, and even still you may be satisfied. The reason why I
only gave it an 8 is because of the lack of totally hilarious set
pieces, I think it had more potential in that aspect than it managed to
fulfil, not to say that it doesn&#x27;t have any memorable moments, just not
as much as it could; when there are some though there are a couple of
nice touches and attention to detail that makes them stand out.
