The Hangover does seem like an unoriginal concept with people partying
to much and waking up with no memory of their previous night. This
movie takes a predictable concept and turns it into a raunchy, goofy,
and utterly hilarious 100 minutes of fun.The Hangover differs from
other R-rated comedies like a Judd Apatow film because this movie
mostly doesn&#x27;t revolve on sexual humor and saying WTF? every five
seconds. It&#x27;s a lot different from comedies like Superbad because The
Hangover takes the littlest jokes and makes them 10x funnier. It&#x27;s
still has jokes about sex, drugs, and alcohol, but the way its
displayed in this movie is new and original.<br /><br />The casting for this movie was just no short of perfect. The
combination of Bradley Cooper(playing the calm, cool, and collected
high school teacher Phil), Ed Helms(the uptight dentist Stu who must
lie to his own wife in order to have fun), and Zach Galifinakis(playing
the scary, strange misfit) is just hysterical.When these three come
together to find their missing pal Doug, theirs no stopping the laughs.
Cooper and Helms are good, but Galifinakis steals the show with great
one-liners and goofy humor. The idea of adding Ken Jeong and Mike Tyson
was just genius, and all of the supporting actors are great.<br /><br />People expecting a non-stop laugh fest might be pleased, and others
might be happy, but fans of Apatow wont be.<br /><br />(One more thing: Wait till the credits. There&#x27;s a hilarious montage of
party photos u gotta see)
