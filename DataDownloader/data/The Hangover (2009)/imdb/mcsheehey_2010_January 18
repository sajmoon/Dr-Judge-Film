&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a fun movie. It&#x27;s consistently entertaining, even
when a few of its jokes fall flat. The plot is predictable, the
characters are familiar, and the film says nothing. Still, it works as
an enjoyable movie to sit down to after a long day.<br /><br />The plot is simple. Doug is getting married, so his two best friends
and brother-in-law-to-be take him to Las Vegas for a weekend of hard
liquor, strippers, and gambling. Things escalate quickly when Phil and
Stu (Doug&#x27;s friends) wake up in their hotel room with Doug&#x27;s
brother-in-law, a tiger, a baby, and an assortment of random odds and
ends. The only thing missing is Doug.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; tells the story of the men&#x27;s quest for Doug; they need
to find and recover him before the time of his wedding. The plot
doesn&#x27;t matter all that much; it&#x27;s more of an excuse to put in an
endless flow of gags. Fortunately, the gags work, and so does the
movie. It never tries to be poignant or PC, and it has a bunch of
laugh-out-loud moments. Accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia
seem a little out-of-place; all three issues are treated in
intentionally absurd fashion.<br /><br />All three of the main actors give good comedic performances, and the
script clips along smoothly. This is not a &#x27;great&#x27; movie, but it
doesn&#x27;t try to be.
