2009_July 22 
I thought this was a decent movie, and I do like Zach (whatever his
last name is), normally. He doesn&#x27;t have to be foul to be funny. Why do
so many movies have so much foul language and such. Hey, I don&#x27;t mind a
little, to be realistic. In my opinion, many of the movies would be
just as funny, if not more so, without so much of it. It&#x27;s like, they
throw the &#x22;F&#x22; word just for a few more laughs. Has the opposite effect
on me. The scenes with the baby were not necessary. I think it would
have been funnier if they had tried NOT to say so many! (As in a few
scenes). As for the plot line, I enjoyed it. It did have me wondering
what was going to happen next. Also, as in previous posts, the Asian
guy was a bit over the top. I was not overly impressed with this movie,
the previews made it look funnier than it actually was. I have no
intention of watching it again.
