this movie is officially the funniest and best comedy i have ever seen.
I&#x27;ve never seen a movie that throughout the movie every at most 2
minutes i wouldn&#x27;t laugh.<br /><br />firstly i&#x27;m not gonna tell you any funny parts or quotes in the movie
because its not fair 4 you but it wouldn&#x27;t make much difference if i
told you 5 or 6 parts because there is so many funny parts its hard to
think of them.<br /><br />Basically it beats all of my past favourite comedy&#x27;s by Judd Apatow
although he is a genius in himself, he just does not beat this movie.
all my past favourites like superbad (my 2nd favourite comedy), knocked
up, forgetting Sarah Marshall nd i love you,man just are not as funny.
it is very hard 2 admit but it is simply just the best comedy ever if
not in my top 5 movies of all time.<br /><br />A MUST SEE nd A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
