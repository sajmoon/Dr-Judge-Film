2009_November 23 
I&#x27;ve paid to see &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; 13 times (my personal record for one
title), so until a funnier flick comes along, it&#x27;s my gold standard for
what a modern comedy should be. A lot of folks would call this funny,
but not the funniest. I can understand that perspective. And a lot of
people who weren&#x27;t laughing at all were attending weekend screenings I
was at. I can only tell those who didn&#x27;t bust a gut at this Vegas is
hell story they should have stayed home and watched reruns of &#x22;Murder,
She Wrote&#x22; or whatever crap they find entertaining. To keep seeing a
film multiple times is to sometimes get a dream crowd and other days
get a group of codgers who are simply at the wrong movie for them!
Those Tuesday nights when the theatre was packed were amazing and the
collective riotous laughter was louder than any other film I&#x27;ve been to
besides &#x22;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x22; and &#x22;This is Spinal Tap&#x22;. I can
only hope we get another collaboration from Phillips, Helms, Cooper,
Galifianakis, Bartha and the rest of this band of lunatics. Best film
of 2009!
