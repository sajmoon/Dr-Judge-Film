Now first let me get one thing straight, I didn&#x27;t see this film at the
theatres based on it&#x27;s trailers. It didn&#x27;t look that funny and I don&#x27;t
usually bother seeing comedies on the big screen as i feel they come
across just as well on DVD as they are not riddled with special effects
etc.<br /><br />But I was highly recommended this film from several different people
who all said it was much funnier than they had expected and that the
trailers didn&#x27;t do the film any justice. One friend of mine even said
the film was one of the funniest films they had ever seen!!!<br /><br />So as soon as it was released on DVD, i decided to check it out myself
and make up my own decision.<br /><br />Now by all means, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a fairly descent comedy. It has
some funny scenes. But that being said, it wasn&#x27;t THAT funny! The
laughs were there but to me they were just brief chuckles and a few
little laughs. I never once found myself out of breath from laughing so
hard as i have in other rescent comedies such as &#x22;Role Models&#x22; and
&#x22;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&#x22;.<br /><br />I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare &#x22;The hangover&#x22; to those films but those
comedies are the ones I find hilarious.<br /><br />I guess Hangover just felt a little predictable and the jokes were so
forced in parts and obviously set up like, here&#x27;s a scene, here&#x27;s some
dialogue and here&#x27;s the punch line!.......ha ha?<br /><br />Plus that Asian dude who played the criminal in the film just wasn&#x27;t
funny at all! I haven&#x27;t seen such terrible acting since Nicolas Cage&#x27;s
un-intentionally comedic performance in &#x22;the Wickerman&#x22; remake!<br /><br />I really did try hard to enjoy this film and it is a good film....it&#x27;s
just not great and overly original in my opinion.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t believe the hype, that&#x27;s all.
