Sometimes, the gags are not so subtle and could be predictable...BUT
the crazy/silly situations succeed in such a quick rhythm that THE
MOVIE BECOMES SOOOOO DELIRIOUS !!! I HAVE LAUGHED SO MUCH THAT I WAS ON
THE EDGE OF A HEART ATTACK,even if I&#x27;m a strong and healthy 29 years
old man....<br /><br />Now ANY MAN WHO&#x27;S ABOUT TO BE MARRIED WILL DEMAND TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN
AS THESE FOUR MEN !!!!<br /><br />And this movie reminds to every married man the great moments of fun
between men he had before the greatest day of his life (or the worst if
the wedding turns bad ;-))<br /><br />Personally, before my wedding, I was disguised into a giant condom,
obliged to drink a horrible pumpkin+milk milk shake (...I HATE pumpkin
so you imagine the result) and I&#x27;ve asked to a psychiatric hospital a
moist and warm shelter...but I found no tiger in my room ;-)<br /><br />No more to say.Roll over
