Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days
before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug&#x27;s
two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy&#x27;s brother Alan
Garner - hop into Tracy&#x27;s father&#x27;s beloved Mercedes convertible for a
24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher,
has the same maturity level as his students when he&#x27;s with his pals.
Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his
controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. And Alan seems to be unaware of
what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning
after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each
with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past
twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in
the suite that shouldn&#x27;t be, and certain things that should be in the
suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category
is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little
pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of
discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to
the missing items. However they are on a race against time because of
Doug&#x27;s wedding... I really wanted to like this film,I really did.It was
extremely talked about,the premise seemed great, it has Vegas as a
background and it has Bradley Cooper in it who I really like since he
was in Alias(2001).Unfortunately The Hangover was a huge disappointment
to me.And don&#x27;t get me wrong I enjoy a good comedy as much as the next
guy but this film is a total and complete disaster.Nothing about it was
clever or creative, most of the jokes were just loud,crude and very
simple. Nothing even quaint or quirky.I might have smiled a couple of
times but I didn&#x27;t laugh once. There&#x27;s no point talking about the
acting either because with such a poor script no matter how good the
acting was the movie would be just as terrible. For me, The Hangover is
a huge disappointment and one of the worst comedies of the year despite
the high rating and all the hype.<br /><br />4/10
