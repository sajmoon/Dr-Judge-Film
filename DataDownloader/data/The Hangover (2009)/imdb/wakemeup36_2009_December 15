This seems get a lot of praise from professional critics and casual
viewers alike. However, this isn&#x27;t going to get much from me. The whole
thing just seems like a rehash of ideas which&#x27;ve been already done
before. Moreover there&#x27;s no fresh feeling to it either as it&#x27;s done in
a typical modern day comedy fashion i.e tons of swearing, lots of sex
references, action scenes and obscene humour. I don&#x27;t have a
particularly huge problem with any of these characteristics but when
they are what the movie is based around, it gets quite a bit annoying.<br /><br />The storyline isn&#x27;t as bad as some of the movies in the same vein. And
there were a few moments that made me smile and even semi laugh. But
the overall humour comes off as pretty dry. Using the f word a billion
times does not make a movie funny. But that seems to be a problem with
a lot of comedies nowadays.<br /><br />Overall, I though it was a pretty mediocre movie and I would only
suggest checking it out if you like similar movies e.g Pineapple
Express, Observe and Report, Superbad etc. Personally, I&#x27;m sick and
tired of these kinds of movies.
