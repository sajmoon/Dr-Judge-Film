2009_July 6 
I would have never considered seeing this 2009 bro-mantic comedy were
it not for the fact that it has been garnering such strong critical
reviews. My curiosity was piqued since on the surface, the film
represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile,
male-oriented audience. However, director Todd Philips (&#x22;Old School&#x22;)
infuses what could have been a tired premise with a no-holds-barred
comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human.
The pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer
little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot
turns. Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the story revolves around
a typical Vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together
for one last night of drink and debauchery. The trio of prospective
groom Doug, straitlaced dentist Stu (who is engaged to a controlling
harpy), and cynical schoolteacher Phil is joined by the bride&#x27;s
brother, Alan, a bearded, beer-bellied and socially awkward geek who
turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this
fraternal clan.<br /><br />The newly established quartet drives from LA to Vegas and ends up
staying in a palatial $4,200-a-night suite at Caesar&#x27;s Palace. After a
rooftop J&#xE4;germeister toast, we flash forward to the morning after with
their room completely trashed. Inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub, a
tiger in the bathroom, a baby in a closet, a hospital band on Phil&#x27;s
wrist, and Stu&#x27;s missing front incisor are the only clues they have to
figure out what happened the night before. Even worse, Doug is missing,
and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding. What
Philips does cleverly is turn his comic hi-jinks story into a detective
story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy. In fact, the
subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility
with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp
precision. Not too surprisingly, as the movie provides greater clarity
on what exactly happened, the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes
rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a high-speed scene.
Nonetheless, some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically
hilarious, for instance, a stun-gun demo for a classroom of grade
school children, a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk, and a
highly inappropriate rendition of 50 Cents&#x27; &#x22;Candy Shop&#x22; at the wedding
reception.<br /><br />Much of the film&#x27;s success has to do with the easy rapport that the
four principals have with each other. The absence of a dominating
comedy figure like Will Ferrell or Steve Carell actually helps this
time around. As Phil, Bradley Cooper (&#x22;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&#x22;)
somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male
into a genuinely likable character. Ed Helms (Andy in the US version of
&#x22;The Office&#x22;) appears to be channeling a bit of Stephen Colbert in
bringing out Stu&#x27;s neurotic, self-protective tendencies. However, most
of the laughs are supplied by stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, who
makes Alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious
manifestation of all the well-intentioned actions that get us in
trouble. Justin Bartha has little to do as Doug, as does Heather Graham
as an obliging stripper/hooker who finds herself married to Stu. Ken
Jeong, the cranky obstetrician in &#x22;Knocked Up&#x22;, does a loopy turn as a
gay gangster in a bit that goes on too long, and look for a very
off-the-wall scene with Mike Tyson. The closing credits provide the
details of the boys&#x27; notorious night through a hysterical series of
increasingly outrageous photos.
