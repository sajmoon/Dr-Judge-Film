Two days before his wedding, Doug (Justin Bartha) drives to Las Vegas
with his best buddies Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms) and his
future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis), for a blow-out bachelor
party they vow they&#x27;ll never forget.<br /><br />But when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding
headaches, they can&#x27;t remember a thing. Their luxury hotel suite is
beyond trashed and the groom is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />With no clue about what happened and little time to spare, the trio
must attempt to retrace their bad decisions from the night before in
order to figure out where things went wrong in the hopes of finding
Doug and getting him back to L.A. in time for his wedding.<br /><br />But the more they begin to uncover, the more they realize just how much
trouble they&#x27;re really in. The Hangover 10/10
