The Hangover is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE
LIFE. All it is an over-hyped over-acted unoriginal piece of garbage.
It is a total rip off of Dude where&#x27;s my car. As a movie critic, The
Hangover was very insulting that the writers think the audience is
actually that stupid. But judging from most of other reviews of the
hangover 1&#x26;2,they are that stupid.<br /><br />This shouldn&#x27;t have even been released as anything more than a TV
movie, and even that should not have done this good. The most
successful R rated comedy ever made? People need to stop watching
movies drunk if they are going to review them, because that movie spat
in the face of Comedies,their audiences and movies in general. The
movie is about a guy about to get married who goes to Vegas with his
friends and &#x22;disappears&#x22;. Then they all wake up hungover and don&#x27;t
remember what happened the night before(What is this like the 50th
movie about hungover idiots who don&#x27;t remember what happened the night
before in the last couple years?)The &#x22;Funny&#x22; parts of the movie are so
forced and most of it is just supposed to be &#x22;shocking&#x22; It&#x27;s like the
writer of this movie just was drunk one night watching movies with his
drunk friends and one of them said &#x22;hey man, you&#x27;re funny.You should
write a Comedy&#x22; because that is literally what I was thinking while I
was watching it. A bunch of drunk idiots working on a movie with no
real movie experience at all.Apes could do a better job.<br /><br />If their was any number lower than 1/10 to rate I would have rated it
that,but unfortunately there isn&#x27;t so I have to rate it 1/10.
