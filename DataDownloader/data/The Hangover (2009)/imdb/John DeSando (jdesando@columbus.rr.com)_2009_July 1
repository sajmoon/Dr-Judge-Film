&#x22;I didn&#x27;t know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.&#x22; Alan (Zach
Galifianakis)<br /><br />If you want more anti-PC humor, The Hangover gives it: gay Asian thugs,
old man without underwear, shrill girlfriend, lovable whore, and
Holocaust joke (see above). This boys-will-be boys comedy thriller has
enough raunch and racism to garner a near NC-17 (stay for the credits)
and enough crude laughs to make a few hundred mil.<br /><br />The weekend in Vegas for three groomsmen and a groom before the wedding
turns into a lost one for the revelers, who can&#x27;t remember what
happened because a low-rent dealer gave them a date-rape drug rather
than cocaine. The result is the chaos only a fianc&#xE9; could dream of:
lost tooth, child, and tiger; marriage to a hooker; $80 K of debt; and
some very perturbed waiting women at home. <br /><br />The premise of their retracing the evening is a good one, providing a
flashback with a detective edge. Throughout, the dialogue does not hold
up to Judd Apitow standards, and the payoffs for the setups are weak. <br /><br />The film is humor underdressed for a wedding.
