The Hollywood bachelor night movie genre hasn&#x27;t brought much glory to
the industry. This put it all to extremes. The guys wake up one morning
in Las Vegas and find a hen, a tiger and a six-months-year-old baby in
their hotel suite. But one of the pals is missing.<br /><br />The rest is even more crazy. This is a performance in taste-lacking,
but it&#x27;s very funny and the tempo is high. The movie is certainly
totally of this world, but 1,5 half hour of shallow plain
entertainment.<br /><br />Las Vegas the myth, is once again the main character here. But you
don&#x27;t mind, since there are absolutely no hang-ups in this movie.
Absolutely none.
