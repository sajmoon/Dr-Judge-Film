This film is without doubt the funniest film I have seen in my 28 years
of existence. I have found most comedies over the last couple of years
to be extremely overrated (especially Seth Rogen movies) and I did
start to worry that I didn&#x27;t have a sense of humour but this film
proves that I was right and all the other comedies that have been made
recently were wrong. The casting is absolutely spot on and I couldn&#x27;t
fault a single performance. Highly recommended and I believe for the
first time in my life I shall be willing to endure another hangover!
The ending was also very clever and left audiences in the theatre
cheering and clapping at the final credits.
