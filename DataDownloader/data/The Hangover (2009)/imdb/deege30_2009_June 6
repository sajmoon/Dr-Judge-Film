I went to this movie with extremely high expectations. I took my
girlfriend along who is not to interested in same type of comedies that
i am. Let&#x27;s just say with in five minutes into the movie myself, the
crowd and my girl were all in stitches. it is a great movie with so
many funny parts that i will be watching it again. the people who are
behind this movie are the guys from old school, which too, was a great
movie. Great job, another winner. Best movie of the summer and possibly
the year. I took my time out to register for this site just so i could
comment about how great this movie is. Def. worth seeing and then
buying for your home collection
