The 2009 film The Hangover directed by Todd Phillips is a mix of
comedy, mystery and suspense that creates a popular cinema hit. The
audience experiences a combined taste of Road Trip and Sherlock Holmes.
It is a perfect film for not just young audiences but adults of all
ages.<br /><br />The film takes places two days before Doug&#x27;s (Justin Bartha) wedding
where the groom to be heads to Vegas for a last bachelor night with his
best friends, student teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) and dentist Stu (Ed
Helms). Also heading along is Alan (Zach Galifianakis) the over-weight
bearded brother of the bride (Sasha Barrese). Alan is a type of guy
that wears purse and usually has perverted thoughts on mind.<br /><br />The four men check into Las Vegas hotel Caesar&#x27;s Palace and head out
for a night in the city. The four men have a drink on top of the hotel
roof, which ends up being the only moment they remember of the night.
In the morning, Phil, Stu and Alan wake-up in their trashed room which
includes blow-up dolls, a baby boy and a tiger in the washroom. The
worst matter at hand is that Doug is missing.<br /><br />The guys end up recreating the evening&#x27;s events by using random clues
such as a wristband from the hospital and receipts from each other&#x27;s
pockets. Each comical situation is not necessarily new to Hollywood but
the scenario and for the fact the guys are in Vegas makes it seem so.
As the guys continue their hunt for Doug, they come across a stripper,
Asian gangster and drug dealer.
