Saw Preview at Vue Cinema Thurrock 2/6/09 This is without a doubt the
funniest film I have seen in quiet a while to tell you anything about
it would spoil the film but suffice to say that I thought my wife would
need the toilet a few times during the film. It has some uncomfortable
tones (it brings a whole new meaning to the expression &#x27;never act with
kids or animals) which may upset some people and the overall effect is
a whacking success. The language is a bit rich at times but given the
situations I think I might have sworn. The actors are mainly unknown
(until now) and that adds to the unpredictability of some of the
funniest scenes in that there are no heroes or villains as such except!
No that would be going too far see the film and enjoy.<br /><br />May God forgive me for laughing so much. So would I buy the DVD? Most
definitely can&#x27;t wait
