The Hangover is a riot! I did not think it would be this funny, but it
was. It is outrageous, entertaining, crude, vulgar, and even offensive,
but man, the best comedy in years. The cast is brilliant, especially
Zach Galifianakis, who has given the best performance of the year so
far. Rachael Harris was fantastic as such a b-word. The writing and
direction are perfect. It really seemed it came from Judd Apatow, and I
am glad that Todd Phillips still has some of the humor that he did in
Old School. Thank you Todd Phillips for making the best R-Rated comedy
of the year, and the funniest film in quite some time (along with the
horror-comedy Drag Me To Hell!)The Hangover is quite a ride!
