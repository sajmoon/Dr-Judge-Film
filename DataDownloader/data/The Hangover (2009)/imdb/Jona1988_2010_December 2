I can state right away that I was both disappointed and surprised by
The Hangover. I had hoped and felt pretty sure that it would be a great
laugh. A film with a simple plot and thin characters but compensates
with very funny stupid humor. While the first two things turned out to
be correct the factors that would make up for those are sadly missing.<br /><br />It starts out pretty dull right away. The scenes that are supposed to
be humorous just seem extremely forced. Of course there are some things
that are at least somewhat funny but I get a strong feeling that for
every kind of comical scene there are several that just fall flat. Soon
one is just getting so irritated at all the things that fail so hard
that I can&#x27;t focus any attention on the few things that almost work.
After some time into the film one gets the idea that it&#x27;s not supposed
to be a film with jokes and that kind of humor rather a comedy where
the fun is placed on people getting into really absurd situations.
Realistic people falling into preposterous, ridiculous events and how
they try to handle them. However this kind of humor just doesn&#x27;t work
here either. It feels so overwrought, really tries to hard. The story
is the average kind for a comedy and the structure of the plot is
actually quite smart. The search of the past which the film revolves
around is well thought out and also well executed. The acting according
to me is alright but nothing more. It could be the script that is to
blame for the characters feeling stiff and pretty dull. Zach
Galifianakis makes the funniest performance but it is not enough to
lift this film more than just above decent entertainment.<br /><br />The Hangover is a real let down. The parts that should have been great,
meaning the humor is just a major miss. The Hangover should have been
stupid fun but instead just stupid 5/10.
