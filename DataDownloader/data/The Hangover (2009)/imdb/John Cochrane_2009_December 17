I have to say that it was so refreshing to watch a comedy movie that
had all the right elements going on and kept you there laughing even as
the credits were rolling. Unbelievably good, very refreshing to see a
great comedy when it seemed as if the whole genre was getting stale.
What I liked most was this story just kept throwing one twist after
another, your just completely left guessing as to what was going to
happen next. The premise is the group has lost one of their foursome
overnight and none of them can remember where he might have ended up.
It&#x27;s a great plot vehicle because you find yourself so intrigued as
well and it almost plays out as a mystery, albeit, an extremely
hilarious mystery movie. Just brilliant, inspired writing here, they
took a great premise and really went with it and the movie does not let
up. You get really hooked on the characters and I found myself rooting
for them all and it makes for a really great ending. Simply great, best
comedy I have seen in years.
