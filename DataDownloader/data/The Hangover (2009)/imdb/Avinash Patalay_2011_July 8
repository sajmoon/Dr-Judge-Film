Time and again the audience has proved fresh thoughts and new ideas are
lapped up with immense joy and the success-o-meter of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is
the proof. It goes without saying that the writing takes the crowning
glory. Very smart, quite clever, intelligent and definitely out-of-box
thinking translated into pen and paper. <br /><br />The four lead characters are so distinctly separate that everyone
carves a niche in your head. Bradley &#x22;Phil&#x22; Cooper, the super-confident
hulk obviously gets icing on the cake with the length of the screen
time. Ed &#x22;Stu&#x22; Helms leaves an impression on how a typical alpha-male
transforms into a prey to the BDSM acts of the oppressor, to the point
its become an acquired taste. Zach &#x22;Alan&#x22; Galifianakis is a lovable
character whom you would love to hate, but later unveils his hidden
talent. Justin &#x22;Doug&#x22; Bartha, the bachelor who makes everybody do a
chicken-run is found only in the beginning and in the end. Heather
Graham has a limited screen time and she doesn&#x27;t miss the opportunity
to pop-out her &#x22;hidden&#x22; talent. Jeffrey Tambor as the would-be
father-in-law leaves an impression. And yes Mike Tyson is a bonus in
the movie.<br /><br />The good thing about the screenplay is the &#x22;blacks out portions&#x22; of the
bachelors party which builds up the suspense quite effectively. A few
snaps as the credit rolls attempts to provide few clues though. Some
good one-liners and a few memorable scenes are bound to be topics of
water-cooler discussion.<br /><br />Here hoping the sequel manages to raise the bar yet again - fingers
x&#x27;ed.
