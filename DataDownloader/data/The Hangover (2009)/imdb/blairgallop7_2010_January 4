2010_January 4 
After watching this film, I thought it was one of the best comedies of
not just 2009 but of the entire decade( the 2000&#x27;s). The Hangover is
about four friends,Phil Wenneck,Stu Price, Alan Garner and Doug
Billings(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha
respectively) who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party but end up
staying longer as they wake up the morning after not remembering much.
The reason why I found this to be one of the funniest films of the
decade as well as one of my favorite comedies is because of the film&#x27;s
plot, the main actors in the film(listed above) as well as some of the
supporting actors(namely Ken Jeong and Heather Graham) and one or two
of the cameos. Overall,it is an hilarious ride from start to finish.
