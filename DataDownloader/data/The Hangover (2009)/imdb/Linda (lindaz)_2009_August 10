This movie being rated with a similar rating as such a great films as
&#x22;Some Like it Hot&#x22;, &#x22;Dr. Strangelove&#x22; and &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22; shocks me.<br /><br />So generic. I find nothing funny about the same old gag trick of
someone suddenly vomiting (which didn&#x27;t look real, but I don&#x27;t care), a
car being trashed, people beaten up, cars trashed more, more beatings,
slap-stick gags, breast shots, genital shots and ugly fat asses and
more vomiting.<br /><br />Certainly the writer or whoever, wanted to use shock effect since most
people nowadays have seen so much and heard so much that they have to
go quite far to shock, but this was sooo cheap and low grade. A few
others here have mentioned this as well and I really wish I had read
their comments, but they were too far down the chain of praise for this
stupidity. I only read the main comment that the IMDb gang has posted
as the representative comment. Not to slam IMDb, it&#x27;s a terrific site
and I&#x27;ve used it for years, but there needs to be a balance so that
people like myself don&#x27;t get sucked into shelling out my hard-earned
money to be dragged through this trash.<br /><br />It starts right off with insipid, re-hashed, foolish-high-school-kid
type pranks which drones on to the very end. And that weird pedophile.
What humor does anyone find in a pedophile? Do most people nowadays
think it&#x27;s funny? Or maybe it went over their heads. I don&#x27;t know. Then
the poor little baby was obviously frightened on purpose to get him to
cry. Just that alone was upsetting me.<br /><br />I did laugh in a couple of places, but that was after I&#x27;d already been
sitting there for half an hour kicking myself that I&#x27;d actually paid to
watch this garbage and that short interval of ha ha didn&#x27;t make up for
the rest of the film which leans heavily on the above-mentioned cheap,
low-grade, slutville humor.
