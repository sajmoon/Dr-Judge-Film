Definitely did not expect this to be anywhere near as good as it was.
The drunk buddies doing dumb stuff format is a good formula for comedy,
but it has been overused. However, this movie refreshes the premise
with some clever humor and innovative situations.<br /><br />The three groomsmen who take their engaged friend on a wild bachelor
party adventure to Vegas at first appear run of the mill stereotypes of
the boozer-buddies genre. The dumb fat guy motif makes you think, &#x22;Here
we go again,&#x22; but they balance routine gags like that with a story that
makes some roller coaster twists that usually work. As things unfold as
to what actually went on during their &#x22;black-out,&#x22; the plot gains more
and more steam. The story is constructed well, showing believable and
likable characters. In other films of this type, too often the heroes
are made out to be obnoxious jerks, which ruins the humor. They really
are concerned for the safety of their missing friend, for example.<br /><br />Minor flaws: Tyson isn&#x27;t funny, even when he mocks himself. The Asian
stereotype seemed thrown in as if they felt they were obliged to do it
for whatever reason. It didn&#x27;t add anything to the comedy, which was
already great in this film.<br /><br />Hangover is probably the best comedy of this type since Animal House.
