This has n&#x27;t really been a good year for comedies this year and when I
saw this trailer I did n&#x27;t really expect much. But, always open to
seeing a comedy movie, I went to the drive and really enjoyed myself.
It was really funny all the way along and even when it stopped to set
up a scene it was still really interesting to watch and I never got
bored throughout the movie. I think most people are used to films like
this right now, with the shock value level set high and trying to make
as many people annoyed as possible, but I like to think this film has a
lot more going for it, with much better humour and if not that, much
funnier character&#x27;s.<br /><br />The film also uses its concept better then all the other comedies that
have been released this year, and the plot line does n&#x27;t disappoint and
the disaster theme, while used in thousands of other Hollywood films
before this is again done really well and keeps this film interesting
and lively.<br /><br />Overall, this was a much funnier movie then I thought it was and is
another movie that has really surprised me by doing the opposite of
what I thought it would be like (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and I was
very glad I decided to this. I give this movie 83%. I would recommend
this for lovers of Apatrow styled movies (Knocked Up, Superbad, Zack
And Miri Make A Porno).
