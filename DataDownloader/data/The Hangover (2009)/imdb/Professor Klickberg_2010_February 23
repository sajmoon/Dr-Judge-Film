2010_February 23 
Admittedly, and perhaps obnoxiously, I&#x27;m one of those who would
normally never see a movie like this. I haven&#x27;t really liked any of the
other films by the director (those I&#x27;ve bothered to see), and I&#x27;m not a
big fan of goofy, drunken, frat-fare contemporary American comedies.<br /><br />Thank goodness my roommate downloaded this one and I could see it for
free. Hey, why not: I had a free Sunday morning.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think either of us stopped laughing throughout the film. Ever.
Which is especially surprising, as even some of the funnier movies I&#x27;ve
seen over the years tend to wane a bit toward the third act. Suddenly,
the plot really comes to the fore and the movie goes from being a
comedy to being an action-packed extravaganza or a drama or a romantic
farce or whatever. <br /><br />Not this time. You will continue to laugh without stop, even through
the credits, thanks to a hilarious photo montage.<br /><br />I was elated that such a movie could be made, and that it could receive
so much praise and commercial success. I have found the Apatow movies
to be boring, pointless, long-winded, and annoying at best, and have
been confused by their success. Thankfully, there are still movies like
The Hangover that show normal guys in fantastic situations and how they
cope in a realistic matrix (yes, I just used the word &#x22;matrix&#x22;--without
being capitalized--in an IMDb review of The Hangover).<br /><br />And I also agree that although all of the actors in the film were
top-notch (even the bg guys who will fool you every time: what a
terrific casting job all around), Zach Galfianakis (sp.?) is the
far-and-away MVP of this film. I remember thinking from Moment One,
&#x22;Goodness, if he acts like this through the whole film, the movie will
already be a winner.&#x22; He does, and it is (and he&#x27;s not the only gem of
the picture). <br /><br />Kudos, Todd. You finally made one that&#x27;s truly hilarious, surprisingly
original (there is a lot here you WON&#x27;T see in Very Bad Things),
thoughtful, well-structured, and--yes, I&#x27;ll say it--even intelligent.
Keep it up, we need more movies like The Hangover. Save us!
