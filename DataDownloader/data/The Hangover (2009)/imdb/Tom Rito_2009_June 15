I was not in a really good mood when I went to see this movie and I
thought that I needed some mindless humor to cheer me up a bit. To my
surprise, this movie turned out to be really funny and endearing at the
same time. I found myself actually liking everyone acting in this film.
The humor was more intelligent then I had expected and I found myself
completely engrossed in the situations on the screen. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong, it was still raunchy guy stuff, but the writing and chemistry of
this film are way beyond normal mass produced material. But the main
reason that I am writing this review is because I don&#x27;t understand the
people that give this movie a rating of one or two. It is OK if you
don&#x27;t care for this type of humor, but it is something else to say the
movie was real bad, even when the rest of the movie theater is laughing
out loud throughout the whole film. Do you think the rest of the people
in the theater are mindless freaks, or are you so self absorbed that
you don&#x27;t realize the rest of the people are really enjoying the film?
Anyway, it is a bachelor movie about four guys that go to Vegas, that
should give you some insight into what kind of movie it is going to be,
and as such, it is really, really funny.
