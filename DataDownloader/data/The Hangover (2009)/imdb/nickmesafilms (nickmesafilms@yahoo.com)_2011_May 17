&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is the newest hit comedy about a bachelor party gone
wrong, when the groom goes missing, and the group of friends tries to
remember what happened the previous night due to a terrible hangover.
The film goes through Vegas, drugs, strippers, herpes, and so many
things drinking can cause, as they try to find their friend before the
wedding. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was a completely hilarious take on the famous
bachelor party flicks. The film has the highest laughter, and the best
expectations to be found. The casting of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach
Galifanakis, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong were hilarious and
impressive, but it&#x27;s Galifanakis who stole the show in every scene he
is in, with his quirky dialouge, and timing. Director Todd Phillips
arranged the movie so well, and he made a movie that made me laugh out
loud throughout. The film had a hilarious well-written script and a
super cast, and the film will remind us what will happen if we take a
&#x22;guy&#x27;s night out&#x22; too far. This film had so many funny moments, we
can&#x27;t stop remembering them. The film was an awesome and hilarious
flick. Now, I learned a valuable lesson on what will might happen at
age 21, in Las Vegas, with bottles of beer in your hand, and containing
a mother-loads of drunken herpes. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a
truly hilarious flick to watch again and again.&#x22;
