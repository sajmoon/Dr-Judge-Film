This movie certainly is a funny comedy, and deserves to be the comedy
of the summer since no other film in its genre has yet to compete with
its series of humorous events. But having said that, this movie seems
to have gained a buzz that has transformed into a drunken mania. Filled
with several WTF and OMG moments with quirky characters, this film
leaves many reminiscing on their own drunken experiences with a great
since of nostalgia and a thirst for their own crazy nights. In fact
most members of the audience leave with one comment amongst their
friends, &#x22;We need to go to Vegas&#x22;. But behind the series of unfortunate
and humorous events, when one analyzes the &#x22;Hangover&#x22; in sobriety, its
not hard to see that its much like the movie, &#x22;Dude Where&#x27;s My Car&#x22; but
with a bigger budget. Perhaps when this movie is available for
households and viewed far from the friends who remember those nostalgic
party nights, some of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; hysteria will fade, and sobriety
will set in.
