Parties, people getting drunk, embarrassing moments: all classic
components of American comedy, all done to death. And yet The Hangover
managed to become one of the big hits of summer 2009, with some critics
and viewers even praising it as &#x22;the funniest movie in years&#x22;. While
that definition is entirely arbitrary (and used a bit too often), it is
true that Todd Phillips&#x27; latest achievement manages the near
impossible: to take an overly familiar topic and turn it into an
unpredictable, hilarious ride.<br /><br />What&#x27;s it all about then? Well, there&#x27;s a guy named Doug (Justin
Bartha) who&#x27;s getting married, and as per American (comedy) tradition
his friends want to make sure his last days of &#x22;freedom&#x22; are spent in
the best way. Hence a trip to Vegas - where else? - in the company of
fun-loving school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), uptight dentist Stu
(Ed Helms, aka Andy from the US version of The Office) and the bride&#x27;s
&#x22;weird&#x22; brother Alan (stand-up comedian Zach Galifianakis), all
prepared for a night of fun they will never forget. Until the next
morning, that is: the hotel room is a mess, Stu&#x27;s missing a tooth,
there&#x27;s a tiger in the bathroom and someone left a baby in the closet.
Oh yeah, and Doug has disappeared...<br /><br />From there on, The Hangover turns into a comedic whodunit, with the
guys trying to retrace their steps so that the wedding can actually
happen. Cue encounters with the police (ouch), a stripper (Heather
Graham on top form), a naked Chinese gangster (Ken Jeong) and Mike
Tyson. All this is handled expertly by Phillips, working from a script
by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the writers of Four Christmases; don&#x27;t
ask) that brings him back to the more &#x22;juvenile&#x22; territory of Road Trip
and Old School after the big-screen &#x22;revisit&#x22; of Strasky &#x26; Hutch. The
difference is this time greater care has been put into the writing,
with a great combination of clever plot structure and endearing
characterizations. Sure, the three leads are essentially comedy types
(especially Alan, who at times channels John Belushi), but they manage
to remain real, believable and, most importantly, relatable.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are a few minor defects that prevent the movie from
being the outright comedic masterpiece some claim it to be. For one
thing, it&#x27;s very much a guy movie, with the female characters
(including Graham) reduced to scenery-filling beauties or, as in the
case of Stu&#x27;s &#x22;sweetheart&#x22;, annoyances. Also, the film doesn&#x27;t really
go all the way with the madness, opting for a safe, hollow final-reel
solution instead of the truly dark and insane material the premise -
and the R-rating - could and would have allowed (think Scorsese&#x27;s After
Hours with more sex jokes).<br /><br />But hey, why complain when most of the film is absolutely hilarious?
The Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis trio is a genuinely adorable bunch of
losers, and Phillips elicits laughs with all kinds of humor, both
verbal (&#x22;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Except herpes.&#x22;) and
physical (all the bits with the tiger and/or the baby), by subverting
some clich&#xE9;s - much like Reservoir Dogs was a heist movie without the
actual heist, this film deals with the aftermath of a night we never
see - and indulging others (&#x22;He&#x27;s funny because he&#x27;s fat&#x22; one character
says of Alan, and he&#x27;s got a point). Throw in a bunch of funny
references (Star Trek&#x27;s &#x22;I&#x27;m a doctor&#x22; gag is used brilliantly) and one
of those absolute rarities in recent comedies (i.e. closing credits
that aren&#x27;t skippable), and you&#x27;ve got one hell of a fun, funny movie.
