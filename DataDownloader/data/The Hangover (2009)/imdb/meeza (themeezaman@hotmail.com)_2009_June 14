Unrememberable, that is what Hangovers are; Unrememberable, through
beers and bars. My apologies to Nat King Cole! We have all had them, we
can&#x27;t stand them, but is a part of &#x22;paying the piper&#x22; for the few
vivacious hours of liquid festive madness from the previous night!
Hangovers!!! I think Hollywood was overdue in providing us a comedic
film about them! Maybe they got hung up with the premise! But finally
they gave it to us and they did not barf it up with the winning comedy
&#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. Let me throw you up the plot of this gem: Three
groomsmen and their about-to-be-wed buddy go to Las Vegas for a
stirring bachelor party. Phil is the cocky ringleader of this Vegasfest
and also the best friend of the groomie Doug. Stu is the neurotic
Dentist buddy who gives his possessive girlfriend muela by lying about
where the boys are going for the bachelor festivities. Alan is Doug&#x27;s
soon-to-be brother-in-law who&#x27;s probably gone over the hangover
threshold zillions of times in his life thereby explaining his
outlandish behavior. So these fearsome foursomes drink it up in Sin
City and before you know it- Hangover Helper gets a service call! They
wake up the morning after with chaos colliding in their not-so-little
Caesars Palace suite- A tiger in the bathroom, a stolen police car, a
baby in the closet, a hanging mattress, a broken tooth, and a missing
Doug. Obviously, their alcohol-induced memory banks are at zilch so it
is oblivious to Phil, Stu, and Alan how this happened. So consequently,
they need to retrace last night&#x27;s itinerary of events to find the lost
Doug. I will not seltzer you up (whatever that means) with more
details, so you just gotta hang on tight &#x26; witness this zany mayhem
that is &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. Director Todd Phillips does phil up this
comedic adventure Vegas ride with side-splitting, off-beat material
that makes you crave for a longer Hangover running time! Bradley Cooper
as Phil had the adequate charismatic pizazz in portraying him. Zach
Galifianakis was very Belushish as the deranged Alan. Justin Bartha as
Doug was not a barfa of laughs in his supporting role, but walked this
acting aisle admirably. But my favorite thespian performance here was
that of Ed Helms as Stu; Helms stewed it up just right with a perfect
blend of comedic acting ingredients. So the remedy for your cinematic
blues is to catch &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; before it gets out of your must-see
system. ***** Excellent
