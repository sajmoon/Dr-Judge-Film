I don&#x27;t normally go to theater to watch comedy movie but last night, I
somehow ended up seeing this movie at the big screen, and I do not
regret it at all. I absolutely loved the movie because it was funny as
he11 but not corny or grossly funny. My wife was feeling a little
skeptical going into the movie as well but we came out feeling pretty
satisfied. I would recommend going to theater to watch this movie
because, trust me, it is more funny when room full of people burst into
laughter all at the same time. I actually do want to see this movie
again. I loved the last movie credit part so make sure you guys don&#x27;t
miss that in theater.
