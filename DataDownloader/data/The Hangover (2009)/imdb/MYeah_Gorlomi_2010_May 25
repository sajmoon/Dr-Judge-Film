Hello everybody! This weekend I saw The Hangover.<br /><br />The film centers on four best friends: Phil Wenneck (Played by Bradley
Cooper) Stu Price (Ed Helms) Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug
Billings (Justin Bartha), who all travel to Las Vegas, to celebrate
Doug&#x27;s bachelor party before he gets married. But the morning after,
they wake up to a massive hangover. And for some reason, they cant
remember ANYTHING from last night. And what&#x27;s worse? It turns out they
have lost Doug. They find out that the reason WHY they can&#x27;t remember
anything is because they were slipped roofies. They have to retrace all
of their steps from the twelve hour period that they have no memory of
to find Doug.<br /><br />And the film is absolutely hilarious!<br /><br />The script is creative, inspired, and brilliantly structured. The film
is occasionally very random, but it&#x27;s still so funny. The film is very
well paced, and isn&#x27;t hindered by slow pace that the first few minutes
does suffer from a bit.<br /><br />The performances are great in this movie. Cooper, Helms, and
Galifianakis all play off of each other so well as an ensemble (They&#x27;re
the three best friends that anyone&#x27;s ever had. :D ), and just as good
separately, along with Justin Bartha as well. They&#x27;re all supported by
some great cameos from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong, Rob
Riggle, and Mike Tyson among others.<br /><br />Overall thoughts: The film&#x27;s strongest benefits are from it&#x27;s creative,
and hilarious screenplay, and performances.<br /><br />The movie gets *** out of **** from me.
