It is about time that we see Bradley Cooper as a leading man, he has
performed so well in comedies like Wet Hot American Summer, Wedding
Crashers and last year&#x27;s Yes Man with Jim Carrey. On the other hand his
co-stars of Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis perform better than most of
the familiar comedy genre faces. This movie was already held with high
expectations before it was released, but those expectations have truly
been met and surpassed altogether. Now at first I was hesitant, because
the whole Rated R gross out comedy style is getting recycled way too
much lately, but this actually turned out to be a hilarious movie, with
nothing seeming like it was recycled from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler or
Kevin Smith movies. The cast actually is made up of people that
normally have to take the backseat as cameo people or supporting
people, and they truly deliver and showcase why they need to lead more
often in films. All in all you really get what you expect and more from
The Hangover. The characters are likable, the story is something new
and different, plus you get a lot of laughs that don&#x27;t seem like they
have been stolen from the Apatow/Sandler movies. This is truly the
breakout comedy of the summer and probably one of the funniest movies
of the year 2009.<br /><br />10/10
