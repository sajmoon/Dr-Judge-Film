This movie will be one to watch while recovering from a hangover. It
doesn&#x27;t require you to think about anything, you&#x27;ll get a few little
laughs from it, and it&#x27;s mildly entertaining. The actors do a decent
job with the outlandish circumstances. There is such a huge truth to
it... when men go away for a guys weekend, they behave like adolescents
on steroids. Had some of the preceding evenings incidents been
plausible, the movie would have scored higher with me. As it was, it
was very clich&#xE9; and very predictable, but still generated a few laughs.
Wait for this one to come out on television and don&#x27;t spend any money
to watch it.
