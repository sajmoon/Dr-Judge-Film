I loved this movie and have seen it a dozen times. Lots of one liners
and funny scenes. My favorite scene is with the taze gun. I lmao at
that one. This was a great cast but Galifinakis really made me laugh
the hardest. He&#x27;s so offbeat. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m really a fan of Ed Helms
too and he always comes up with some funny stuff. There was a lot of
hype surrounding this movie when it came out, but it most definitely
delivered for me. So many great quotes in this movie too. I don&#x27;t know
where to begin. The cast really did mesh well together though. Great
supporting performances by Rachel Harris and even an appearance by the
great Dan Band. They perform a couple songs at the end of the movie
when the wedding finally occurs. I recommend this movie only if you
want to laugh your arse off.
