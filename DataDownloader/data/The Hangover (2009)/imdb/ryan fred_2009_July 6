This is the single funniest movie for people with my kind of humor ever
made. My kind of humor is movies like Old School, Anchorman, Knocked
up, and Superbad. And as much as I love all of those movies, in pure
hilarity this one blows them out of the water. Even if you didn&#x27;t care
for those movies very much I would still expect everyone who sees it to
laugh until it hurts. I want to watch it a second time so I can hear
all the jokes I was too busy laughing through the first time to catch.
Unless you are easily offended or have a heart condition where a huge
amount of laughter can be a bad thins this is a must see. Best comedy
ever made bar none.
