Now, I have seen &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; twice, n I&#x27;m still not able to
understand why this movie is rated so high. In fact, American Pie was
better. There was nothing to laugh about. There wasn&#x27;t a scene I can
remember now... What was there to laugh about.? The Tiger in the
bathroom or Alen married to a sex=worker... IT ain&#x27;t a good film et
AL... I found Pink Panther very entertaining and its rated 5.1....It&#x27;s
really a mad mad mad mad world.. I hope these kinda poor sense of humor
movies dun come in the near future...WASTE of TIME. Now, I really am in
a hangover, I had to see Snatch several times to feel better..Todd
Philips disappointed this time.
