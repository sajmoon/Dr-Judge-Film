Okay, it&#x27;s about a stag night that goes wrong, four thirtysomething
lads are heading out to the city of sin, Las Vegas - when they awake
the next morning things have gone badly wrong but they can&#x27;t remember
any of it and have to retrace their steps.<br /><br />I enjoyed it enough but it didn&#x27;t quite hit the spot, somehow I felt
Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, 40 Years Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah
Marshall) would have made it work better. It has the flavour of Ferris
Bueller&#x27;s Day Off, but we don&#x27;t quite get time to know the characters
and the humour is a bit broad, a bit obvious in that it&#x27;s designed to
evoke the audience sympathies. Ooh, one of their friends is a bit weird
with a horrid beard and lets his pants hang down of his backside! He&#x27;s
not allowed to be near schools it seems! What a character! Yawn. None
of the actors are really comic actors. I didn&#x27;t quite warm to them. <br /><br />Towards the end of the film it loses touch with any semblance of
reality, unlike &#x27;kids&#x27;&#x27; movies like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller,
where you had your heart in your mouth towards the finale.<br /><br />What it did have in common with Apatow&#x27;s films is the vein of misogyny
he gets accused of; all of the women are shrews bar the happy hooker in
Vegas played inevitably by Heather Graham.<br /><br />Great soundtrack, Vegas looks terrific but not a hugely endearing film.
