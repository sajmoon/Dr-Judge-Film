This movie was not good at all. The whole time that it played all of
100 minutes of it; I sat their bored out of my mind. This however is
because I am not a fan of the dumb funny movies. I honestly do not see
how this movie became so popular. Then again it was probably watched by
mostly guys. I have seen a few other dumb funny movies and felt the
same way about them. I do not get and do not think that I will ever get
what makes this movie so funny. I will continue to be against them and
will suggest that people do not go see them, but who will listen to me.
I am one person with an opinion that will probably go against tons and
tons of people that find humor in people acting dumb. And well that is
not me. Sure I might laugh here and there but only at how much work
they put into the things that would not usually be funny, but are funny
now because other people said it was. Hopefully some people will side
with me and agree that this movie was nonsense.
