The Hangover to some is a masterpiece, to others, it is another pile of
crude sex jokes that is American comedy. The reason for this, in my
opinion, is the result of years and years and countless numbers of low
budget, cheesy, and low quality comedy movies you have probably seen on
Comedy Central. The Hangover on the outside seems to be this, but if
one digs deeper into the movie, they will discover that it is indeed a
remarkable movie including the quest of 4 men, (all possessing unique
traits), to have as much fun they can have before Doug gets married. It
is all a matter of perception. Before I saw this movie, I expected
another one of those few-laugh, crappy movies shown on TV practically 2
weeks after the release. I assure this is not the case. However, some
say this movie is the &#x22;best of all comedies&#x22;. Well, this is definitely
not agreeable to most avid movie fans (especially ones above the age of
18). This reaction is because of the number of moviegoers who have not
been exposed to some of the earlier, greater comedy works. Instead they
have been exposed to the cheesy and low quality works with little or no
effort to organize a reliable plot as well as other movie needs. It is
instead stuffed with stupid and out-of-date punchlines and tasteless
humor to arouse a younger audience who will pay for a movie ticket to
get some cheap thrills. Think of this movie as a &#x22;breath of fresh air&#x22;
to the disasters in comedy in the past 5 years.
