I love humor, it&#x27;s one of my favorite film genres. And I like all kinds
of outrageous comedy ranging from &#x27;Borat&#x27; to &#x27;There&#x27;s Something About
Mary&#x27; to Spike Lee&#x27;s &#x27;She Hate Me&#x27;. I laughed so hard during these
films I thought I would fall out of my seat! This proves I&#x27;m certainly
not a prude or squeamish! <br /><br />But The Hangover is such a bad film I barely chuckled or even smiled!
Anyone who has ever experienced - or dealt with people who have been
physically and/or sexually abused will probably feel a bit disturbed by
seeing simulated sexual abuse, and calling it funny! I have to admit, I
finally walked out of the theater because beside being depraved in a
bad way the film was also desperately boring! I could care less about
any of the main characters! And the humor was so unimaginative and
forced! <br /><br />The film&#x27;s trailers fooled me into thinking The Hangover would be worth
checking out. It&#x27;s not the first time a trailer was much better than
the film, nor will it be the last.Unfortunately, I wasted $10.00 during
a recession. The next time I see something as bad as The Hangover, I
intend to get a refund!<br /><br />For those who think child abuse is NOT funny read: &#x27;Licensing Parents:
