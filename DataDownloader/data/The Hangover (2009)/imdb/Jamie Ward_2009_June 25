&#x22;We all do dumb s*** when we&#x27;re f***ed up&#x22; concedes a rather sombre
Mike Tyson when reviewing security footage of four random drunkards
stealing his tiger and urinating in his pool&#x97;and it&#x27;s at this moment,
around two-thirds of the way into the bizarre but infectiously humorous
trip that is The Hangover that everything shifts into place. Maybe it&#x27;s
something to do with the fact that if Tyson can sit back and laugh at
the absurdities and downright obnoxiously reckless abandon that he
witnesses when brought into contact with those guys, then we can too. I
seriously doubt it, but the entire expedition that is The Hangover is
equally as&#x97;if not more-so&#x97;dubious than seeing a bearded guy get knocked
out by the heavyweight boxer to the tune of Phil Collins&#x27; In The Air
Tonight, but this in no way makes the feature any less entertaining or
downright hilarious. In fact, that&#x27;s exactly what makes it the romp
that it is; it&#x27;s silly, indulgent and somewhat charred like a barbequed
steak mixed with some tough liquor, but with a fine ensemble of
tangible characters and a pace that keeps things readily engaging and
entertaining, The Hangover is fun, fun, fun&#x97;and the best thing is that
you won&#x27;t wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.<br /><br />Taking place over the course of two days and nights as three best
friends attempt to put the jigsaw pieces of their wild night out in
Vegas together in order to find their missing friend, The Hangover is a
deliciously simple albeit compelling story. Striking right at the heart
of modern western society and its tendency to do just as these guys do
every now and again, the majority of Todd Phillips&#x27; feature here is
steeped in infectious pathos that plays into that ever-so
tried-and-true method of combining observational humour with broad,
situation farce. The result is a story that flows excellently from act
to act, keeps the jokes and gags steady throughout whilst developing
characters and throwing them around often enough to keep the viewer
laughing, intrigued and laughing some more. To be fair, there is a
certain lack of substance to the overall arc of the adventure penned
here by Lucas and Moore (something that is evident in a large portion
of their previous works to date) that inevitably stops the feature from
ever becoming more than a light-hearted buddy-comedy, but you probably
won&#x27;t notice thanks to lack of pauses in laughter provoked by the
script or the actors.<br /><br />At its heart however, despite the robustly imaginative and complex
intertwining of the central characters&#x27; journey, it is the characters
themselves that make the majority of this hangover such a joy to watch.
While the movie ostensibly revolves around four friends, much of the
screen time is given to just three of those who share a wonderful
chemistry that always feels flesh, edgy and natural. Through the
performances of Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis (who
gets much of the movie&#x27;s laughs as the awkward and weird bearded guy
with a baby), the buddy/road-trip story that serves as the centre-piece
for all their drunken antics, missing teeth, stolen babies and stun
guns to revolve around really hammers home the key narrative that
propels things forward and retains the script&#x27;s distinctly
Y-chromosome-centric nature. Sure, there&#x27;s plenty of material here that
the ladies of the audience will be able to latch onto, but there&#x27;s no
denying the overtly boyish tendencies that rule supreme here that will
be sure to give male audiences with a thirst for profane, crude comedy
the most satisfaction. Sharp dialogue and genuinely exciting plotting
makes this one of this year&#x27;s most remarkable and hilarious comedies.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)
