I guess you&#x27;ll probably know by now the yardstick I use for comedies,
and that&#x27;s if I don&#x27;t laugh until my tears flow uncontrollably, then
it&#x27;s not 5-star funny. Granted that there wasn&#x27;t any comedic situation
here that had warranted my laughter from the belly and opened my tear
ducts, it did have some classic moments that would bring out some
genuine mirth, albeit sporadically, though the film managed to fuel
itself up to last the 100 minute distance.<br /><br />Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to get married, and as a rite of passage,
his best male pals in schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), dentist Stu
(Ed Helms) and brother-in-law-to-be Alan (Zach Galifianakis) decide
that they should have a no holds barred bachelor&#x27;s party in sin city
Las Vegas. After all, whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But
who would&#x27;ve counted upon a rag-tag group to deliver him there and back
safely and on time for his big day, since Phil&#x27;s pretty much the frat
boy leader of the group, just too eager to let his hair down, Stu&#x27;s
toeing the thin line of being the party-pooper, having to deal with an
overbearing girlfriend, and Alan&#x27;s just plain Rain Man dumb, which of
course is perfect for some nonsensical one- liners and moments.<br /><br />After a wild night out which we don&#x27;t get to see (and so to keep you
guessing), Doug&#x27;s found to be missing, and to add to that, Jon Lucas
and Scott Moore&#x27;s story sets everything up for the events soon to
follow, planting elements such as those which you&#x27;ve seen in the
trailer &#x96; a broken tooth, a baby, a tiger in the bathroom, a hotel
suite totally trashed and a stolen police car. Every element links to
something that happened in the last 12 hours, and it&#x27;s up to the trio
to establish the series of events from the clues presented, so as to
find out where their groom could possibly be.<br /><br />It plays out like fusion of a comedy and a light hearted mystery, since
none of them could even remotely remember what they did (and that too
is not a stone left unturned). The fun factor came from how the trio of
Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis share some incredible chemistry as boys who
discover their hand firmly within the cookie jar, having to untie the
knotty mess that they find themselves in. And to add to the delight, a
lot of events happening in proper chronological order, have plenty of
random bits to keep you tickled pink, before you realize that they all
actually made sense, especially when you have enough clues to piece
them all together. After this I&#x27;m on the lookout for future Galifianak
projects as it seemed that he&#x27;s now a contender up the Jack Black&#x27;s
niche alley.<br /><br />Director Todd Phillips had thrown in plenty of the staple profanity and
token nudity commonly found in Hollywood mass comedies, and not
forgetting racial stereotypes such as drug dealers and effeminate
gangster chiefs all for the sake of eliciting some laughs. Something
you can credit Phillips for though, is trying to sustain a comedy but
unleashing the funny bits in a restrained manner so as to evenly spread
out laughter, though the last 20 minutes to its inevitable finale did
seem to fizzle out a little, until the end credits roll for that photo
montage.<br /><br />The Hangover boasts a contemporary pop soundtrack, though the winner in
the film is of course Las Vegas itself, with the film being quite a
shrewd city promotional video, with its glitzy night time neon lights,
and showcasing a host of activities one could get into, such as casinos
that never sleep, and quickie-weddings in small specialized churches
for that purpose. Having spent a week at the same city, it&#x27;s a treat of
course to revisit on screen some of the places I&#x27;ve previously set foot
on, and if opportunities present themselves again, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m
going back.<br /><br />Comedy of the year this may not be in my books, but it does have enough
to make it pretty delightful to sit through, especially if you&#x27;re in
the company of buddies who share the same traits as the characters, or
sharing the same sense of humour.
