After seeing the previews I thought this movie might have potential,
but it would probably turn out to be another one of those
&#x22;stupid-funny&#x22; movies that come out on a monthly basis.<br /><br />Well the movie definitely has potential. This movie is easily up there
in the top 5 funniest movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. Possibly even the
funniest. The plot is pretty original, and the casting was perfect in
my opinion. Zach Galifianakis, who plays Alan, is hilarious the whole
way through, and none of the other characters disappoint either. The
humor is crude and, while not as bad as Borat, is still enough to
turn-off some of the more conservative moviegoers. However if you&#x27;re up
for it this is definitely a movie worth the money. I highly recommend
it.
