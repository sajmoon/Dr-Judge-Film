Against my better judgment I decided to see this film because of the
success of its sequel and the high ratings here. Surely if a sequel was
made for a film, then the original film must&#x27;ve been good enough to
warrant that, right? Well... no, it wasn&#x27;t. I should&#x27;ve remembered the
Resident Evil and Scream series. (They just keep pumping these out,
don&#x27;t they?)<br /><br />Anyway, I can&#x27;t say I was disappointed. I pretty much got what I
expected: a bunch of guys getting together to do something wildly
stupid so that we could laugh at them. OK, I was hoping for more
because of the success of the sequel but, unfortunately, that was it.
It was about as funny as watching some guys trying to tip a cow. In the
words of Seth from Superbad, &#x22;That&#x27;s not even clever!&#x22;<br /><br />This film could&#x27;ve been funny and the jokes sound funny on paper, but
on film, they weren&#x27;t. I mean, an image of some guys waking up from
their stupor to find themselves in the middle of a disheveled room with
a chicken and a tiger and no clue as to what they&#x27;ve done does sound
funny. So why wasn&#x27;t it? Probably because there was no chemistry among
the main characters. It was just a group of individuals experiencing
unusual circumstances. I felt nothing for them.<br /><br />The only time I actually laughed was during that scene where the
bearded guy was playing with the baby. That was roughly 20 minutes into
the movie and that was pretty much the only, really funny, though
somewhat vulgar and tasteless, scene. The rest of the time I was only
interested in finding out how the movie would end. <br /><br />I didn&#x27;t find much humor in this film but it did keep me interested
enough to finish watching it which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 7.
