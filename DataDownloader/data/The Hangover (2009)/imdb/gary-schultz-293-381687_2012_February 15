I just joined IMDb then, felt I wanted to join the nay-sayers with this
terrible movie. I was curious because it seems to be one of those love
it or hate it things. God, a lot of movie critics even rate it highly!
In the first half hour it&#x27;s not funny once, not even a little bit
funny. Makes u wonder about yr fellow man. Ben Elton is funny. John
Cleese is funny as Basil Fawlty. Benny Hill. Robin Williams even. These
guys are just horrible. Okay I have to say more. Need ten lines. Well
it is not a movie one would bother critiquing. One movie critic said it
was funny line by line. I guess line by line you could have different
responses, u could grimace one line, groan the next, look puzzled
maybe, perhaps at the least worst lines yr grimace might segue into a
bitter smile, the sort of look Clint Eastwood might have when looking
at a massacre. Hey but I&#x27;m a glutton 4 punishment. I&#x27;ll keep going and
see if I can find one amusing thing in the whole shebang. Next (2nd)
movie I review I&#x27;m gonna love.
