Not funny at all, just not funny, not a bit. I remember I smiled a few
times but no recollection of a laugh (I saw the 10 minute longer
unrated version). I was hoping for some laughs and fun but instead I
got so bored, damn I have this habit to see to the end! It was
unnecessary to shoot for the cinema, is waste of time for the audience.
I don&#x27;t understand what some people find funny about this movie but if
you are not a person that laughs at everything, if you are selective
about comedy, you will not want to see this movie again. Even
laughers-at-fart and laughers-at-curse won&#x27;t like it. And a part 2 is
coming?! God forbid!
