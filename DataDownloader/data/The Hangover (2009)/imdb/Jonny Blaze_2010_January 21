i cant be 100 percent sure why people think this movies is that good i
mean it has funny parts definitely, but as a whole i didn&#x27;t think it
was that funny. other then Zach Galifianakis i didn&#x27;t really find any
one to be hilarious i rather hated the character of stu price played by
ed helms finding him to lack in the humor department and he became
quite annoying after sometime. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this movie is funny
especially the first time but upon multiple viewings it seemed to lose
its touch where as some other movies that i have watched numerous times
such as anchorman, step brothers, billy madison and hot rod just to
name a few, have continued to make me laugh every time i watched them.
in conclusion this movie is watchable, is funny and is entertaining but
its just not as good as people have said it to be i rate it a 6. All i
have to say is kudos to Zach Galifianakis for being hilarious and thank
you to the people who made this for putting him in it cuz without him
the story line is kinda boring.<br /><br />p.s. thank god that the character of doug disappears in this film
Because He Is A Horrible Actor. thank you and good night
