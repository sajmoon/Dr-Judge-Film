It&#x27;s nice to thoroughly enjoy a comedy this decade without catching a
single whiff of Apatow. The fact that audiences are eating up the
boundary-crossing humor of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; this summer and the famous
producer of &#x22;Knocked Up&#x22; and &#x22;Superbad&#x22; nor any of his cronies (Seth
Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, etc.) don&#x27;t have so much as a finger
print on it might be over half the reason for its praise.<br /><br />Starring rising leading man Bradley Cooper (&#x22;Wedding Crashers,&#x22; &#x22;Yes
Man&#x22;), Ed Helms (&#x22;The Office&#x22;) and stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis,
&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; doesn&#x27;t boast the stylings of any comedic actors that
we&#x27;ve already been beaten to death with by Hollywood in the last ten
years and they&#x27;re all extremely talented. Their characters are
incredibly well-developed and free of too much stereotype, their
comedic timing excellent and the concept they&#x27;re thrown into so perfect
you can&#x27;t believe it hasn&#x27;t been done before.<br /><br />Two days before their friend Doug&#x27;s (Justin Bartha of &#x22;National
Treasure&#x22;) wedding, the aforementioned characters head out for a night
in Las Vegas as do many a bachelor party. But &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; doesn&#x27;t
show their night out, instead it takes us straight to the next morning
where they wake up to find strange animals in their room, one is
missing a tooth and the groom-to-be is missing. And of course they
don&#x27;t remember a thing.<br /><br />Todd Phillips, director of &#x22;Old School,&#x22; another comedy that for its
time brought us new comedians and situations keeps the timing and
revealing funny moments at a healthy pace. Every time we think it
doesn&#x27;t get funnier or more ridiculous, it does. The writing team of
Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who delivered last winter&#x27;s notable flop
&#x22;Four Christmases&#x22; really hit it big here. Having character retrace
their footsteps and discover their debauchery of the previous night
rather than showing it gives the trend toward R-rated comedy a new set
of wheels. The gags here are nothing all that foreign to us, but with
an unfamiliar cast of talented actors it feels pretty new. Everything
is just revitalized, given new life because the script really fits the
characters.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t particularly like Cooper previously, but he gets more of a
chance to exercise his range with a character that&#x27;s not stale. Helms
can truly be a foul-mouthed funny kind of guy, but his nerdy
girlfriend-whipped character Stu is perfect because it forces him to
hold back, therefore making the moments he explodes funnier and more
believable. Galifianakis is something else. He&#x27;s the new funny we&#x27;ve
been looking for. Alan is a horribly dumb, outrageously gutsy but sweet
character with a child&#x27;s heart. Galifianakis plays a wide range of
comedy perfectly whether needing to hold back and be dumb and cute or
go all out physically.<br /><br />There are some gaping holes in &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; like the fact that they
are apparently hung over but do not eat or drink the entire film. Also,
only Helms&#x27; character gets a true subplot - - everyone else is just
there to make us laugh. This isn&#x27;t one of those comedies with heart.
Instead, we learn to love the characters because they&#x27;re funny and we
empathize with their ingeniously funny situation quickly. Still, some
of the most original comedy I&#x27;ve seen in years. And don&#x27;t forget the
best and most boundary-pushing credits sequence ever. No question now
that this is the era of dirty comedy and &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; delivers some
of its finest.
