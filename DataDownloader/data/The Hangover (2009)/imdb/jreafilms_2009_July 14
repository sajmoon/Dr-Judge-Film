It&#x27;s always great when you can share a movie experience with an entire
theater of strangers. When an entire crowd can burst out in a unison of
laughter, all the while making you appreciate each gag for its
originality and authenticity. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is one of those rare
movies where the audience becomes an extension of the group of buddies
with which you went to see the movie. Not to mention, it&#x27;s f**king
hilarious. The unity with strangers aside, this movie is wholly
satisfying as a comedy. Biased though I am (a Zach Galifianakis fan for
years now), I enjoyed this film for everything it is: a gut-buster,
brimming with laughs not only farcical in its whimsy, but deep-rooted
in the stellar casts&#x27; interplay. Galifianakis is brilliant as the
somewhat-disturbed third wheel thrust upon the bachelor party, almost
all of his lines memorable and quotable. Cooper is spot-on as the
dis-likable man-boy, ultimately redeemed through his belief in
friendship and a renewed relationship with his wife. Helms somewhat
continues his role from the office, an overly preppy suburbanite with a
wild side (not to mention, wholly committed to the wrong woman), and
uniquely hilarious nonetheless. So here&#x27;s the kicker: I&#x27;m a film
graduate, raised on uppity purebred master cinema, praising the work of
the &#x22;lowest&#x22; form of entertainment: comedy. This movie was thoroughly
entertaining, engrossing, and above all, absolutely hysterical.
Shouldn&#x27;t my reason for purchasing a ticket to be entertained? Isn&#x27;t
that what this movie did? Did it not unify a roomful of complete
strangers with its unabashed hilarity? What then, is so wrong about
this relationship?
