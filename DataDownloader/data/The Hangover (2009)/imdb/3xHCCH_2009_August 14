I did not really plan to watch this movie because I am not the type of
guy who enjoys drinking alcohol. The poster was strange and the stars
were unknowns. First impression was: Not Interested. However, the news
came that this flick actually topped the summer box office Stateside. I
heard a couple of radio DJs talk about how funny and cleverly plotted
it was. I had some time to kill, so I was able to watch it.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is about a stag party in Vegas which goes totally
haywire. When they wake up wasted the next morning, their suite was
thrashed, one finds that he has lost a tooth, there&#x27;s a tiger in the
bathroom, there&#x27;s a baby in the closet, and worst of all, the groom is
nowhere to be found. The three groomsmen needed to retrace the
obviously wild night they had to find their friend and get him to the
wedding on time.<br /><br />It was very funny how the director went on to steer the audience into
realizing what happened together with the characters, as we follow them
through their madcap misadventures. As this is a movie, realism is
thrown out of the window and our IQ should be checked at the door. You
simply know those situations are out of this world, but it grabs our
attention as we too want to know exactly what happened. There were
potentially offensive subjects like police brutality and Asian racism,
but we know these were done tongue-in-cheek, so we go along with the
fun ride.<br /><br />I have not seen these actors before. They are really the unlikeliest of
gangs. I do not think people like them would flock together in real
life. Bradley Cooper plays the mean alpha male. Ed Helms plays the
nerdy straight-laced dentist. Zach Galifianakis plays the weirdo
brother of the bride. Justin Bartha plays the groom. Their chemistry
with each other and willingness to make fun of themselves adds to the
success of this film.
