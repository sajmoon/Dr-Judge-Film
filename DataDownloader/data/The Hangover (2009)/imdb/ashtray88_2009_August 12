Todd Phillips did it again. He create this crazy comedy which only him
can do. I&#x27;m a great fan of Road Trip and Old School. These movies are
my favorite comedy movies of all time. But i think that the guys who
rate on IMDb are complete idiots, because to rate Hangover 8,2 is the
dumbest thing anyone can do. Rate of Road Trip is 6,4 and rate of Old
School is 7, come on guys, these two movies are way better than
Hangover. My rate of Hangover is 7, because many comedies which are
better than Hangover are rate lower. I first saw Zach Galifianakis in
this movie and he is the trade mark of this movie. He is The Hangover.
Heather Graham is hot as always. I&#x27;m sorry of Jeffrey Tambor, because
he is the man, he is the funniest grandfather ever, but he is in this
movie for couple of minutes. But he rules. Remember him in Arrested
Development. Bravo for the casting and thank you Todd Phillips for
another great Comedy.
