2009_June 6 
Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper fall so perfectly into
the circumstances of a night out without the wife/girlfriend&#x97;a bachelor
party, no less&#x97;that we&#x27;re all happy we&#x27;re safe in the audience clucking
our tongues but secretly envying every single moment (one that includes
the ever watchable Heather Graham). These boys fall and fall hard, and
trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely can&#x27;t remember
brought more laughs than the last time I laughed this consistently
(that was &#x22;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x22;).<br /><br />The cast never forgets that they are actors here and not on an episode
of &#x22;Jackass&#x22; as Apatow&#x27;s comedies often feel. There&#x27;s tight control on
the dialog and we never descend into simple slapstick. Oh, there&#x27;s
broad humor, but we&#x27;re watching terrific actors in very broad
situations. The trailer is a perfect sample of what you&#x27;re going to
get, although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the
trailer hints. But it&#x27;s never just sensationalism, because I
can&#x97;regrettably, I confess&#x97;relate to waking up in a room with a chicken
and not knowing exactly from whence it came.<br /><br />Galifiankis has the most unique character (well, besides a naked
Chinese fellow, but you can discover that one for yourself) and he&#x27;s
wonderful to watch. Not everything he does comes off 100%, but when he
scores, it&#x27;s so far out from our own comfort zone, that when the jaws
of the other characters drop, we&#x27;re right there with them. Rachel
Harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why
marriage can be so fearful.<br /><br />This is as tidy a script as &#x22;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&#x22; and just as
beautifully shot. The cinematography could be pulled from any of the
Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce ads, and it only adds to our confidence
that whatever is coming around the next corner, we don&#x27;t have to worry
that it will wreck all that&#x27;s gone before. The makers of this little
gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control, and it
was joy to finally get a great farce that we&#x27;re very sorry to see end.
I see that &#x22;Hangover, 2&#x22; is in development, and I hope lighting strikes
twice.<br /><br />(The standard for wedding singer has been set. Anyone want to top
this?)
