A simple, familiar setup is actually made worthwhile in this amusingly
raunchy comedy. Four friends from Los Angeles, one soon to be married
the other three his loyal groomsmen, take a trip to Las Vegas to have
the time of their lives and give the would-be groom a night he&#x27;ll never
forget. It actually turns into a night they all forget when they awake
the next morning with a bad hangover, no recollection of what occurred
the previous night, and a series of misadventures that only grow
stranger as they try to piece together the events of their wild
&#x22;bachelor party.&#x22; What initially sounds like a variation on the
dreadful stoner comedy Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car? actually produces some
very clever results with more than enough vulgar and very funny gags,
appealing characters, and an overall feel-good tone. Slow at first, but
the more out of control the jokes get the more laughs they produce,
though it does arrive at an inevitable conclusion. Beyond that it&#x27;s
wildly good fun. ***
