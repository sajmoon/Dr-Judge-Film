I went to see this title today, and boy I&#x27;m glad I did.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a guy flick. During this film you will turn to
your buddies and say &#x22;Yeah I could see this being us!&#x22; This movie will
let you leave the theater with a smile on your face for ten dollars
well spent. With its ups and downs, to its &#x22;What the...&#x22; moments, and
its constant gags that will have you laughing from the bottom of your
gut, this movie is a must see for the comedy thirsty movie goer in need
of an oasis.<br /><br />If your in need of a good comedy film, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone
with a sense of humor. The film does a brilliant job of a &#x22;Memento&#x22;
style chronology. From beginning to end, this film will keep you
begging for more.
