What can I say, best comedy since the Jim Carry,Adam Sandler,Chris
Farley days of the mid 1990&#x27;s. Sure a little far fetched in some scenes
but still never a dull moment. Just the little things Alan says,and the
expressions on their faces, during the crew&#x27;s small talk is priceless
in itself.<br /><br />Taking place in Las Vegas just adds to the comedy value of the film.
The unrated movie version is just perfect, and the original release is
missing some key moments.<br /><br />They couldn&#x27;t have picked a better cast and crew to do this comedy, 4
friends all different in many ways, but still find a way to laugh in
the worst of times.
