Like apple pie and STDs, raunchy sex comedies are common, and &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22;, a film helmed by Todd Phillips (&#x22;Old School&#x22;, &#x22;Road Trip&#x22;,
&#x22;Starsky and Hutch: The Movie&#x22;), belongs in the genre, yet it has a
straight story to make the whole film likable and competent, even to
some haters, who dislike T&#x26;A and profanity.<br /><br />Unethical schoolteacher Phil (Brad Cooper of &#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22;,
&#x22;Valentine&#x27;s Day&#x22; and &#x22;A-Team: The Movie&#x22;), henpecked dentist Stu (Ed
Helms of &#x22;The Office&#x22;, US version) and bizarre rich man-kid Alan (Zach
Galifianakis of &#x22;Bored to Death&#x22; and Phillips&#x27;s upcoming &#x22;Due Date&#x22;)
decide to give their bud Doug (Justin Bartha of the National Treasure
films) a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas, where gambling, alcohol and
loose women are endless, before marrying Alan&#x27;s level-headed sis, Tracy
(Sacha Barrese).<br /><br />However, Alan sneaks some &#x22;Good Morning, Cinderella&#x22; (aka the date rape
drug) into the boy&#x27;s initial party drinks, and the three endure the
title, let along missing the groom!<br /><br />To find Doug, the trio has to retrace their steps, involving Stu&#x27;s
missing tooth, a stolen police car, a baby, the baby&#x27;s stripper/escort
mom (sweet Heather Graham of &#x22;Boogie Nights&#x22;), a foul-mouthed mobster
(Ken Jeong of &#x22;Knocked Up&#x22;), $80,000, Mike Tyson&#x27;s tiger and Mike Tyson
himself. Adults, these days&#x85; <br /><br />Phillips expertly takes the solid script penned by Jon Lucas and Scott
Moore (&#x22;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&#x22;, &#x22;Four Christmases&#x22;) and reinforces
it, making sure it doesn&#x27;t go off the tracks like some of the works of
Judd Apatow, yet the film can be recognized as an unofficial sequel of
&#x22;Superbad&#x22;, due to the similarities of the films&#x27; heroes.<br /><br />The cast works so damn well, it wouldn&#x27;t be any surprise if they had
real war stories of indecent revelry. Cooper and Helms shine as
man-children on different levels; the former feeling trapped by his job
and family, the latter being pussy-whipped by his shrewish girlfriend
(Rachael Harris). Due to their predicament, they man up. Galifianakis&#x27;s
the resident goof, making the late John Belushi look sane while Graham
spunky reps healthy womanhood, giving relief to Helms, my favorite of
the three.<br /><br />There are nice bits by Jeffrey Tambor (&#x22;Arrested Development&#x22;) as
Alan&#x27;s dad and Mike Epps (&#x22;Next Day Air&#x22;) as a drug dealer. I could do
without the R-rated wedding singer, who&#x27;s no Barry White in the art of
seduction. Phillips has a fun cameo. Photo evidence of the party
decorates the end credits scroll perfectly.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; shamelessly and smartly proves Las Vegas is a nice place
to party, but not to lose your friend, get blasted and have a tiger in
your hotel room&#x27;s bathroom while taking a whiz.
