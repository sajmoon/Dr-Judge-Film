2010_January 1 
When the movie was first released and I saw the trailer, I wasn&#x27;t
impressed. After it was released on DVD and I saw that 90,000+ IMDb
users had rated it at 8.0, I thought maybe I missed something and
should give it a chance. I did give it a chance; I didn&#x27;t miss
anything. Wow, what a waste of time. There were a few jokes and a few
situations that hit the mark, but mostly it left my group shaking our
collective heads and wishing we could have that hour and a half of our
lives back. The premise was promising; 3 friends plus an odd-ball
brother-in-law in Vegas for a bachelor party (although for most of the
time, it&#x27;s just 3 since the groom-to-be goes missing) that goes awry.
But out of the 3 remaining prominent characters, only 2 of them are
interesting on any level. Bradley Cooper&#x27;s school teacher is supposed
to be the straight-man in the group that plays off the wackiness of the
others, but he adds no comedic value and the other 2 aren&#x27;t wacky
enough, with a few exceptions, to be funny on their own.
