We had heard a lot about this movie prior to watching. All I can say is
what a disappointment. It really wasn&#x27;t that funny. A few amusing
moments but never once did we laugh out loud or have to stop the movie
because we missed something due to the laughter.<br /><br />This doesn&#x27;t compare to older classic comedies such as Caddyshack or
Animal House and it is a shame to even have this compared to those. Old
School was still much funnier than this. Zach G. is not funny at all
except in a goofy way. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t understand what the big hype is over this movie or how anyone
can rate it as one of the best comedies of all time.
