The classical stag-party has always been a popular subject in sexual
comedies.The Hangover makes an innovative twist setting the story on
the day after the bachelor party.The result is an excellent comedy
which made me have a great time.<br /><br />The Hangover resulted to be much better than what I expected because of
its sober tone and ingenious screenplay,which exaggerates enough in
order to make us laugh,at the same time it tells us a very interesting
story which is well structured.I like to finally see a comedy which
does not forget to endorsing the laughs with a solid story.The movie
uses elements we have seen on other comedies (like the prostitute with
a good heart or the expensive car of the father-in-law they have to
take special care) but they are used on a natural way,and they are well
implemented to the story.<br /><br />But I think the best element from this movie is the brilliant
cast.Director Todd Phillips made the good decision of selecting a solid
cast with excellent instincts for comedy.I also appreciated the fact
that the actors are not Hollywood stars,because that makes the
situations from the movie more realistic.It would have been very easy
(and commercially less risky) to hire Vince Vaughn,Owen Wilson,Ben
Stiller or Dane Cook,but I really appreciate that Phillips did not fall
on that trap,because if he did that,the situations portrayed in The
Hangover would not have felt so real.<br /><br />I also appreciated that besides all the rudeness from the jokes,The
Hangover has good moments of human warmth and friendship.I took an
enormous surprise with this brilliant comedy,and I gave it a very
enthusiastic recommendation to anyone who wants to have a memorable and
hugely funny time.
