2010_April 17 
From the beginning, I kept getting the feeling that the movie&#x27;s story
and laughs were due to kick in any minute, right around the corner,
about to happen in the next scene. This never happened.<br /><br />I did manage to force a laugh once or twice and the plot kept me
interested to watch to the end but it was a bit of a chore. The only
character with any depth and realism was the dentist. The other lead
actors did not have enough substance, in order to draw humour out of
the situations they were planted in.<br /><br />I think this is a brand of American humour which is not to my taste,
though I can see why it would appeal to some other tastes. It&#x27;s very
much about exchanges of 1-liner insults, so if you find this funny, the
movie will probably appeal. South Park come to mind as a similar genre
and perhaps, going back a while, movies like Caddyshack or Smokey and
the Bandit.<br /><br />For me, disappointing.
