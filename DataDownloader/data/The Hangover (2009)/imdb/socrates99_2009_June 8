2009_June 8 
I must have read a half-dozen reviews of this movie before seeing it.
My wife and I were in need of a few good laughs but instead we
struggled for every one. I frankly can&#x27;t imagine a more damning
criticism. My expectations had been wildly off the mark. The players
were pleasant enough but not particularly engaging or worth as much
time as given to them here. Allen, though over-the-top, was my favorite
as the bearded somewhat sappy goof-ball. He was fun to listen to and
watch, for a while. But the storyline was not very impressive and
seemed to have been written by someone in high school. It just tries
way too hard to be cute. Probably one of its better points is it didn&#x27;t
denigrate or belittle any particular ethnic group. To the contrary, one
of its obvious intentions is a strangely low-key and stealth attempt to
put in a good word for Jews as, I guess, fairly ordinary, fun-loving
people. It did take a shot at gays, however, and Mike Tyson, probably
without realizing it, is made to mimic a fairly recent European
commercial where an ape plays the drums to a familiar song whose title
I can&#x27;t remember. If I were the producers I&#x27;d pray Mike doesn&#x27;t find
out about that!
