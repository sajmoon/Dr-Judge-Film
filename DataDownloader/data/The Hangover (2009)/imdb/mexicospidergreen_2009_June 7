What do you get when you take the concept of &#x22;Dude Where&#x27;s My Car&#x22; add
Mike Tyson, a tiger, and set it in Vegas? The result is a bloody
masterpiece. Director Todd Philips (Old School) has outdone himself,
and brings us his latest comedy that&#x27;s so rude, profane, offensive, and
raunchy, you just can&#x27;t help but laugh. With days before his wedding
Doug (Justin Burtha AKA: Riley off National Treasure) takes his friends
Phil (Bradley Cooper &#x96; He&#x27;s Just Not that into you), Stu (The Daily
Show&#x27;s Ed Helms) and Doug&#x27;s Joaquin Phoenix look alike brother Allan
(Zach Galifianakis) out on a road trip to Vegas for a night they&#x27;ll
never forget. The next morning Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up hungover
with a tiger along with a baby in hiding their hotel room, and Doug
missing. With only a day left to find him, the men set out on a city
wide search using CSI tactics, but the question is can they find him in
time for the wedding? The Hangover is a hangover you won&#x27;t forget
anytime soon. It takes what could have been just your average R rated
raunchfest and turn it into something that&#x27;s fun, classy, and utterly
outrageous (thanks to the hilarious and likable chemistry between the
cast.) At moments you&#x27;ll feel that the comedy is forced, and some of
the crudeness felt unneeded but at the end you&#x27;ll realize you&#x27;ve had
such a fun time you won&#x27;t even remember its flaws. This is sure to be
an instant classic and is by far the best comedy of 2009, but it&#x27;s made
for a certain audience in mind so if Sex Jokes, Profanity, or partial
nudity isn&#x27;t for you then, you might want to sit this one out. For
those that don&#x27;t care about that, if you&#x27;re looking for a comedy loaded
with fun, heart and cameos (Mike Tyson being the most obvious one) then
grab $10 sneak in a bottle of vodka, bring your friends and let this be
a hangover you won&#x27;t forget.
