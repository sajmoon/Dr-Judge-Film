What happens when four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor&#x27;s party? Good
question! Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach
Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha) team up for a trip they will
never remember! Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) also adds to the unforgettable
laughs! On top of all that Mike Tyson makes an appearance! Better than
other comedies such as Old School, Anchorman, or even Wedding Crashers.
The only thing I would recommend is not to let younger children watch
this since there&#x27;s a lot of cussing and sexual references. All in all,
one of the funniest films of all time! <br /><br />9/10..not sure how the sequel will play out!
