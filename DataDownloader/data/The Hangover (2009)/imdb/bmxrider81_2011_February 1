I really don&#x27;t. There were SOME chuckle points but for the most part, I
thought this movie was boring; unless this was a stoner film then a few
things make more sense but I still found this movie BORING. Movies are
meant to entertain, but I sure as hell didn&#x27;t find this movie
entertaining. It&#x27;s more of an insult to heavy drinkers.<br /><br />1) nobody noticed the groom-to-be when they pulled the mattress from
the roof? 2) how is moving a tiger funny? <br /><br />3) how is seeing a naked Asian funny? <br /><br />4) the sackless guy who was afraid of his fianc&#xE9; didn&#x27;t bother to bring
the photo album from the chapel? 5) what kind of retard brings a camera
to a bachelor party?<br /><br />I recommend that anybody who hasn&#x27;t seen this film, watch it once then
get wasted to forget such a crapfest.
