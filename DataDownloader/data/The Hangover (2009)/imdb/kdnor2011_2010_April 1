2010_April 1 
Let me tell you, I watched this movie after my little brother and
sister. So of course, before I could watch it, they kept telling me all
the jokes, so when I watched it, I thought I had heard all the jokes.
Boy was I wrong, though it wasn&#x27;t as funny because some jokes were
ruined, but there were plenty of jokes that I laughed out loud at. This
movie was funny, that&#x27;s all there is to it, it&#x27;s funny. You got the fat
guy, the nerd, and the wise ass, it follows the clich&#xE9;s, but it still
stays fresh. Ironically my favorite character was Doug who was only in
1/4 of the movie, but that&#x27;s just because I love Justin Bartha. Can I
say it&#x27;s the funnies comedy of all time, no, but it was the best of
2009, in the top five of the decade, and top ten of all time. It&#x27;s
funny, entertaining, and puts a smile to your face.
