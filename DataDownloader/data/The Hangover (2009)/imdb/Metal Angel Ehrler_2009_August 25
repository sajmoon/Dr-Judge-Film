Oh my god. I simply had to write this critique straight off the
theaters. There is no way to exemplify how much fun and original this
movie is without raving on and on about it all night (which would make
me disclose a million spoilers, and you don&#x27;t want me to do that).<br /><br />It&#x27;s about four friends, one of them is getting married in two days,
and they decide to go to Las Vegas to have their bachelor party.
Everything starts out all right, with the four dudes toasting atop the
rooftop of their Vegas hotel to a wonderful unfolding night, and then
we fast forward to the next morning, when three of them awake in their
hotel bedroom (which is wrecked beyond repair and features a hilarious
set of new additions) and they notice the groom is missing. What&#x27;s
worse, none remembers what happened the night before. And so begins
their two-day adventure through Vegas trying to find their lost partner
and, in the way, discovering the hysterically crazy things they did
that night.<br /><br />At first, it may seem like your typical bromedy, and you indulge in the
movie&#x27;s plot expecting to have a few laughs and later forget about it.
But you get, oh, so much more. The character development is spot-on,
the plot is seriously funny and (wow) believable even in its absurdity.
The performances are very good, the directing is awesome. The film
actually involves you, and it doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously and it
doesn&#x27;t try to be funny, unlike other comedies who seem to strain
themselves to force laughter out of you. This is a truly special
comedy, perhaps the best comedy I&#x27;ve seen all year.<br /><br />The screenplay itself is worthy of its praise, and I wouldn&#x27;t be amazed
if it pulls a stunt at next year&#x27;s Oscars receiving an Academy Award
nod. Todd Phillips certainly rein-vindicated himself and his film
earned a rightful spot among those which we&#x27;ll remember for some time
to come. Why, it&#x27;s even better than &#x22;Pineapple Express&#x22; and &#x22;I Love
You, Man&#x22;, which I also consider to be excellent bromedies.<br /><br />Whether you simply want to be entertained, or whether you want to
experience a fun, modern comedy that&#x27;s both hilarious and
perfectly-made, you can&#x27;t miss out on this one.<br /><br />Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!!
