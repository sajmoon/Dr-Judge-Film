Having never experienced a hangover I can&#x27;t say much about what it
feels like but I have heard some amusing hangover stories from friends.
I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this movie. I thought it would be just
another silly Hollywood comedy loaded with non-funny done-to-death
toilet humour and very little substance. However, I was pleasantly
surprised. In a way it does remind me of &#x27;Dude Where&#x27;s My Car&#x27; but with
a more interesting storyline (not that I&#x27;m putting down the
aforementioned example which was funny in its own right). The story
itself is told well and the selection of Vegas, which itself is a city
full of mysteries and excitements, is a clever choice. Of course the
situations are pretty extreme but that only builds the humour rather
than destroy. The cast that includes Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach
Galifianakis, Justin Bartha and Heather Graham form a solid cast. I
wouldn&#x27;t go far enough to call it the best comedy because that would be
lying but &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is fun enough to watch with friends.
