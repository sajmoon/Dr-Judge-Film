Went to see it with my wife last week. We laughed a little, but there
is NOTHING memorable in this film. They seem like nice boys, and the
stuff wasn&#x27;t too raunchy, but nothing timeless or classic. At All.<br /><br />Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s? Better.<br /><br />City Slickers? Better.<br /><br />I could go on, but why bother?<br /><br />None of the movies these days are very good. The industry is
collapsing. There is a lack of good writing. The actors are all boring.
The girls are pretty, but that&#x27;s not enough. Nothing is interesting in
these movies any more.
