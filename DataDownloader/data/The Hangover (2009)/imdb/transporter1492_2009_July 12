I watched this movie without any real hopes of seeing a great comedy, I
was expecting a movie that would make me laugh in certain situations,
BUT I was so very wrong. The Hangover is one of the most memorable
comedies ever made.<br /><br />The script is very well written, the jokes are unique, fun and the most
important thing is that they aren&#x27;t silly as most of the jokes in
comedies nowadays are. The characters are very well created, they make
you care for them and &#x22;feel them&#x22; and most of all they are funny (you
must know what I&#x27;m talking about). The acting is great, there isn&#x27;t any
overacting and even if there is, it makes you laugh so hard that you
forget all about it. I won&#x27;t bother writing the storyline or any of the
jokes in order to make this movie experience even better for those of
you who haven&#x27;t seen the movie yet, but I assure you, if nothing else,
it will make you laugh.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone who has ever been drunk, married,
bored etc., basically I would just like to say that i recommend this
movie to every single person. And yes, it&#x27;s that great!<br /><br />Best regards from Slovenia!
