I&#x27;d seen &#x22;I Love you man&#x22; the previous week and had hoped for something
equally funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />Sadly The Hangover is weak, lame, unfunny, poorly cast and really just
a total waste of time. Personally I&#x27;d wait until it&#x27;s a weekly hire DVD
and then be suspect.<br /><br />How it got to be #130 on the IMDb Top 250 really makes me reconsider
using IMDb ratings as a guide to movie-going. And question any
newspaper critics who give it even faint praise.<br /><br />The fact we have to write a minimum 10 lines about this here is a
further travesty of justice!
