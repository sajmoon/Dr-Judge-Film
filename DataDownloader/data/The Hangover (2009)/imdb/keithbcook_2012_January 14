2012_January 14 
This has all the makings of something really special and a film where
men (especially) can relate to on one of their drunken nights when they
cannot remember the night before (is it always because the party is so
good that you cannot remember - somehow do not think so!) and as the
car sped off and they took their first drink on the roof tops, I was
almost rubbing my hands together in anticipation.<br /><br />Then.... DISAPPOINTMENT it was suddenly the next morning and as the
film unfolded we see how many ridiculous activities they could get up
to in one night (think they MUST have ran our of hours?) If this was a
comedy then I want my money back, This did not even produce a smile.
Then I read that part 2 is not so funny....
