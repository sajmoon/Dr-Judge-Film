Funniest movie I&#x27;ve ever seen!!! The quote above is just one of many
from this movie!! There are enough one liners to quote for the rest of
the year! Well, at least according to everyone at my school. Ha ha ha!
Mike Tyson even made me laugh, and not at him this time. Ed Helms is at
his best for sure here! I have nothing against &#x22;My Best Friend&#x27;s
Wedding&#x22; but how can you compare those two movies!?!<br /><br />The end was the best part though. My girlfriend&#x27;s face was so red for
days from laughing so hard!!!! And the bachelor party in the movie was
so much better than the ones I&#x27;ve been to in real life!! That is pretty
sad though, so take it for what you will. Most importantly, if you do
not see this movie, you will have no idea what everyone is talking
about!
