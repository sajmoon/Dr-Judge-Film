Worth watching. I believe &#x22;IF&#x22; the cast was made up of.......<br /><br />Paul Rudd , Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, and Steve Carell and the
Director , Writer , and Producers were better , then this Movie
could&#x27;ve been one of the funniest movies of the Decade<br /><br />The writers and director totally suck, they didn&#x27;t utilize Mike Epps or
Heather Graham at all. They could have given them way better lines and
more of them.<br /><br />The reason this movie is so highly regarded is because the premise is
great and the potential is massive .<br /><br />It&#x27;s a let down because the writer and director didn&#x27;t do a good job.
The actors did their parts very well , but they were limited because of
the poor producing. I don&#x27;t normally trash people like this but I&#x27;m so
angry at the missed opportunity with this movie. I almost felt like
this about Oldschool , but this was a terrible miss. <br /><br />It&#x27;s like the underdog everyone is rooting for... getting to the
Superbowl...winning at half time.... and then losing the game. 3.5/5 If
someone else made it 6/5
