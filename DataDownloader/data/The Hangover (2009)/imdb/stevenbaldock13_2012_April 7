People get caught up in hype that surrounds films far to often. I kept
hearing how this is the funniest film for years. I watched it and
smiled once! The characters were so predictable, much like the jokes
and the story. The stupid, brainless guy that gets everyone else in
trouble (Stifler with a beard and less funny), the geeky looser that is
a born victim, the guy that has a good job and family but acts a fool
with his friends (vince vaughn in old school). The formula has just
been used too many times. I&#x27;ve given it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t the worst
film ever and had it been released 10 years ago it probably would have
been quite different and funny at points. If you want to watch a better
version of a pre wedding mis-hap film, try Batchelor party 2, I found
that much better film.
