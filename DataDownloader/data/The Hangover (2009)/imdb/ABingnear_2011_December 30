OK for starters I am probably a bit older (53) than the demographic
this film was targeting. In spite of my &#x22;advanced&#x22; years I found that
this film is the funniest &#x22;slob comedy&#x22; I have seen since Animal House
(the original in the genre). I&#x27;d rate it an 8 1/2, but there is no
provision in the ratings block for decimals, or fractions. <br /><br />I really don&#x27;t want to get into the situations the guys find themselves
in as there is an &#x22;answer&#x22; for everything in the last 40 minutes of the
movie. Even the most outrageous things get a &#x22;plausible&#x22; explanation,
plausible, and undeniably hysterical. <br /><br />All in all a very fun movie.
