Only reason I am adding my two cents in is because I want to negate one
negative rating on this site. I haven&#x27;t laughed this much since Blazing
Saddles, and people that is a long time ago! I thought The Hangover was
brilliant. <br /><br />My 12 year old son begged me to take him.(that much I fear I should
have did a little investigation, a couple of scenes warrant NC-17) I
figured okay another Pineapple Express, for my son what&#x27;s 90 minutes of
boredom, no biggie. I went in blindly. Then WAM, this was F-U-N-N-Y,
funny stuff, if you didn&#x27;t laugh, that&#x27;s sad, maybe time to lighten up.
For me these were original and fresh gags! And I&#x27;m no fan of R-Rated
sexist slap stick usually filled with mindless moronic nonsense, but
this movie is the bomb! It is definitely a man&#x27;s movie though.<br /><br />The writers are fantastic comedians with the utmost timing, the acting
is superb. Who are these dudes?! The only &#x27;actor&#x27; I recognized was
Heather Graham and she was awesome too. 2 thumbs up, I&#x27;m buying the DVD
for sure. No exaggeration, for me, this was the comedy of the decade.
