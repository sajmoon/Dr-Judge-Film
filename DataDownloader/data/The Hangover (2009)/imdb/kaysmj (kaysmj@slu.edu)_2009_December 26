As a 32 year old all American white male, I should have thoroughly
enjoyed this movie. But not only did I not, I really really hated it. A
low budget cast of unknown, utterly uninteresting, and completely
unlikeable characters. A juvenile, mindless, and just plain stupid
storyline that apparently tried to put a slapstick comic spin on 1998&#x27;s
excellent &#x22;Very Bad Things&#x22;. You know the story; a group guys go to Las
Vegas for a bachelor party that turns into nightmare. But this time the
morons that made this movie threw in a gross fat guy, a tiger, and an
annoying Chinese bad guy. Oh, and I can&#x27;t forget a barely recognizable
and very out of shape Mike Tyson. The only think that would have
redeemed this mess would have been if they all did a Thelma and Louise
and drove off a cliff, or in this case the Hoover Dam.
