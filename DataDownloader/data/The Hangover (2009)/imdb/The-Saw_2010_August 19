I hate that I love this movie. Everyone rates it 10/10 everyone says
its so hilarious, some even say its the funniest movie of all time.
Even though its not the funniest movie ever, its a really funny movie.
It actually lives up to all the hype. The actors do GREAT, and make a
hilarious movie. Keep in mind, this movie is directed by the same guy
that directed Old School (2003) which is also very funny. The Hangover
is also very similar to old school. Also, it is similar to: Dude,
wheres my car? (2000). However, this movie is much funnier than dude,
wheres my car. So if you like Old School and dude wheres my car, check
this movie out for sure. An instant classic and not overrated at all in
my opinion. This is a must see.
