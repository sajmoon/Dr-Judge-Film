I can&#x27;t figure out if reviews and ratings of this movie are plain
marketing or am I getting too old. Most original comedy of year and so
on and so on my ass. Story is is simple as it gets: Four guys go to
Vegas, get drunk and stoned which makes them really cool and one of
them even marries a stripper. And that&#x27;s about it. Yeah people. Far
out. This MUST be #hundredandsomething movie of all times. Since I have
seen few recommendations before watching it, I kept waiting for THE
moment, it would really start being really good. Regrettably, it goes
mostly down from the tiger on. Well, movie is not completely bad and
can make make a fun evening out with your (preferably) male friends,
preferably after a beer or two, in normal circumstances i would give it
6 or 7, but since a have to balance a little for all that nonsense, it
gets five from me.
