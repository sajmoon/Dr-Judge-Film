The Hangover 2009. &#x97; should be hung, drawn and quartered&#x85; I
unfortunately had the misfortune of watching this film on DVD.<br /><br />The Baby scenes are vile, both visually and mentally violating for any
intellectually receptive audience whose cognitive skills and abilities
are above age 7... and since when were Babies capable of choosing their
own acting roles, especially roles that depict infant masturbation and
child molestation as comical, &#x22;Babies are not sexually developed
adults&#x22; and are supposedly under the protection of their parents, or
guardians, or the state. Any scene that tries to deliver the concept of
humour being present when making fun of masturbating a Baby is sadly
deranged. <br /><br />I think that scene should carry a jail sentence for humouring the crime
of sexually abusing children. The mere suggestion of masturbating a
baby in front of your friends is not possible as humour, not under any
circumstances is this ever ethical, moral or socially acceptable, there
is nothing comical about these scenes, they only serve to fuel more
baser minds and contribute to this disturbing problem by desensitising
what little public awareness there is regarding sexual abuse of
children, and clearly ignores the victims &#x27;the actual adults&#x27; who were
abused as children, how can these baby scenes sit legally and
legitimately as comedy?<br /><br />The film may have been the usual stereotypical formulation for it&#x27;s
target market were it minus the baby scenes, I switched it off and
vomited...
