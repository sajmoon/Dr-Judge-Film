Usually we expect a lot less in the movies than what we see in the
trailers, as they are supposed to be good to attract people to the
movie. But occasionally you get some of the movies which outperforms
not only the trailers but also your expectations from a movie. And
Hangover is definitely is one of these occasional movies.<br /><br />You will never regret even a single second of the movie. After the
initial plot and the introduction of the characters, the ride begins
and never slows down till the end of the movie. Every character in the
movie, the timing of the events and the flow of the story is excellent. <br /><br />The best part is, nobody in the movie is trying to be funny but still
you will have a smile on your face throughout the movie.
