i don&#x27;t care that this movie is stupid, i like stupid comedies, that&#x27;s
not the problem with this film, the problem is that whoever wrote the
jokes to this movie was having a really f*cked up writers block, and in
desperation went to his nearest blockbuster and rent every stupid
comedy made in the last 20 years and, in a very messy operation, start
copy/pasting every joke and storyline, so now, we got this stupid
movie, that some studio executive that really dislike watching movies,
approve under the assumption that this has some originality, but really
it should be being announced as a parody, like the unwatchable &#x22;____&#x22;
movie saga from the infamous seltzer/friedberg couple.<br /><br />the extremely high rating is something i can only explain myself
telling me that most of the voters haven&#x27;t ever seen a comedy before,
or that we are living in a crescent more stupid society, that can even
get that the &#x22;what happen last night?&#x22; storyline has a king in the
stupid comedy realm, and that&#x27;s &#x22;dude, where is my car?&#x22;, or that the
&#x22;bachelor party&#x22; storyline has it&#x27;s begging and it&#x27;s end with &#x22;bachelor
party&#x22;, or that the cool guy that hate his life but at the end he
discovers that really loves his wife and kid it has been done since the
1920&#x27;s!, or that the wimp who is scared of his girlfriend but at the
end redeem himself by rebelling against his wimpiness is the most
common character in film history... and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />this movie is the copy of the copy of a few good movies. it can
entertain, obviously it can, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve an over 7 rating...
not even and over 6. for me is a 4, is funny, but i&#x27;m tired to see
copies, and overall like &#x22;the hangover&#x22;, unoriginal as something can
be.
