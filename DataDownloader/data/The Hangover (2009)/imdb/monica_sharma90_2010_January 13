To begin with, I just have to state that it has been a really long time
since I laughed as much as I did while watching The Hangover, and I am
a film addict.<br /><br />The Hangover is a refreshingly original story about 4 guys (Stu, Alan,
Phil, and Doug) and their wild bachelor party in Las Vegas. The
originality of the movie comes from the fact that we do not actually
see the night of partying, but the day after -- it&#x27;s a surprise that
this has not been done before. The plot of the story is that Stu, Alan
and Phil must retrace their steps because they seem to have lost Doug,
their best friend who is getting married. The only problem, is that
they can&#x27;t remember anything that happened the previous night. <br /><br />After Todd Phillips&#x27; success with Old School and Starsky and Hutch, he
has become one of my favourite comedic directors and I had very high
expectations of The Hangover because of Phillips. <br /><br />The extraordinary characters that were put together for this movie is
what makes it so epic. Without Phil (played by Bradley Cooper) - the
handsome masochist, Stu (played by Ed Helms) - the &#x22;responsable&#x22;
dentist, and Alan (played by Zach Galifianakis) - the insanely odd but
hilarious brother in law, The Hangover would not have been what it was.
Credit must also be given to Heather Graham as she plays Jade, the
happy stripper with the lost baby. Furthermore, the addition of Ken
Jeong as Mr. Chow bring together a hysterical cast that will not be
forgotten. <br /><br />Again, the fact that this storyline has not been done before (at least
so well) is mind blowing. The wild and insane situations faced by this
group of friends is laugh-out-loud funny. The slapstick humour, along
with each characters original personalities, make us want to watch the
movie over and over again. The amazing one liners that will be quoted
over and over again to friends and family make us wonder about the
minds that come up with such things. And the (musical)cameo by Mike
Tyson is just icing on the cake. <br /><br />So for all those who are skeptical about Todd Phillips, and live by
Judd Apatow, I truly suggest putting that skepticism aside and watch
The Hangover. Call up all your friends, get comfortable, and prepare to
laugh for and hour and a half straight.
