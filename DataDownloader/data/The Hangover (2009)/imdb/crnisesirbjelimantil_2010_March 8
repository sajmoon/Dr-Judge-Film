Why this movie have so high rate? One of the most idiotic, brainless,
boring movie I have ever seen. Forced humor followed with very bad
acting, which make me feel like idiot just for watching it!!! I can&#x27;t
remember one scene that make me laugh. For example, scene in the
bathroom when fat guy pee beside toilette, or his speech at the roof
when cuts his palm or Mike Tyson and his tiger or... - who laugh at
that. Why do people make this kind of movie and who is a target group,
it&#x27;s not even for 10 years old kids. P.S. &#x22;1&#x22; is to big grade for this,
if there were negative points I&#x27;ll surely will give -1!!! The worst
spent 1:30 min of may time..........
