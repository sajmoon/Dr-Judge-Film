this movie was absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s really difficult to sit in the
seat during the course of the movie. The movie is a non-stop comedy and
I fell of the seat 3 times during the course of the movie and
absolutely lost all of my energy laughing through the movie. For all
those who want to see an absolute comedy movie this movie is for you!!
:D :D<br /><br />the role played by Bradley Cooper was really good. The scene where he
humps the tiger was really funny!!<br /><br />Zach Galifianakis was really hilarious during the movie. He was totally
out of the world :D
