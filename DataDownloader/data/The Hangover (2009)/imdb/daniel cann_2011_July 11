The plot to &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is a familiar one: Four friends go to Las
Vegas for a Stag Do. Three of them wake up in their hotel suite the day
after the night before with no recollection of what happened and worse,
a missing groom! The film then follows the three groomsmen trying to
pick up the threads and discover exactly what happened to their lost
friend. To top things off they have a race against the clock to get the
groom back to Los Angeles in time for his wedding! The themes explored,
the setting and scenario: Stag goes very wrong in Las Vegas has all
been done before, but thanks to a sharp script from writers Jon Lucas
and Scott Moore there is plenty of dry, sardonic wit and banter amidst
all the slapstick humour and pratfalls. As the clues, eccentric
characters and bizarre situations accumulate the comedy flows freely in
the desert city of vice. This is very much like &#x27;Animal House&#x27; does
Vegas or an &#x27;American Pie&#x27; for thirty-somethings.<br /><br />None of this would work of course but for the central performances from
Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha as Phil,
Stu, Alan and Doug respectively. The four men have a convincing
chemistry and the viewer will believe in their characters and how they
bounce off one another. Their verbal exchanges had me doubled up in
laughter for most of the film. Heather Graham shows up as a daffy but
lovable stripper and there are plenty of other comic turns, characters
and cameos to keep things lively.<br /><br />Ask yourself this: How many films can boast a baby, Mike Tyson, a
tiger, a stripper, Asian gangsters, unhinged cops, a wedding chapel,
casino&#x27;s and a desert in its plot? Yes there are familiar themes
explored here but it&#x27;s all carried off with aplomb. It is excellently
played by all protagonists and without them it would all have fallen
pretty flat.<br /><br />&#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is hilarious, the perfect antidote to a bad week at work
or on a rainy day, a great pick me up!
