On a balls-out,let-it-all ride Bachelor party trip to Vegas,friends
Stu(Ed Helms,unleashed at long last here to full comedic
effect),Phil(Bradley Cooper,a career that&#x27;s appeared out of nowhere to
become money in the bank)and future in-law Alan(Zach Gallifinakis,in my
mind the biggest scene thief of this show) run into one small problem
after a night of inspired debauchery:the guest of honor,groom-to-be
Doug(Justin Bartha,who&#x27;s sorta there for the film)is missing. And
now,three guys whose various poor or short-sighted judgments have left
them disoriented and in some legal trouble,must combine their wits to
go find their friend and future husband-to-be in an economy of time and
an odd,sometimes disturbing set of clues left in wake to help them.<br /><br />Director Todd Phillips,expanding upon the &#x22;bad boys being bad boys&#x22;
formula that was modestly offered with star power to back it in Old
School,now goes for a slightly more modest cast(from Will Ferrell,Vince
Vaughn and Luke Wilson to Helms,Bartha,Gallifinakis and Cooper)but a
more ambitious,raunchier(if that can be believed)and adventurous story
to make this largely funny,sometimes hard to believe comedy. A deft
usage of actors in supporting roles--among them the now underused
Heather Graham as a pleasant,bubbly single mom of infant,who just
happens to be a stripper and escort;Ken Jeong as the wiry,foul-tempered
and quite possibly gay Asian mobster who has it in for the
heroes;Rachael Harris as Stu&#x27;s brittle,domineering bitch of a
girlfriend;and Mike Tyson as,get this,Mike Tyson--highlight this tour
de force,and that&#x27;s not even to mention the near cameos as some
not-too-lightweight-themselves talents as Jeffrey Tambor(as the Bride
and Alan&#x27;s dad),Bryan Callen(as a thick-accented wedding chapel
proprietor),Sasha Barresee(mostly in one-note fret mode as the
unravelling bride-to-be),Mike Epps(as a discombobulated drug
dealer),Rob Riggle(as a uniform cop,one of Vegas&#x27; NOT finest)and Cleo
King(as his equally inept and cruel partner).<br /><br />The summary line notes that this movie,as funny ands sometimes
shocking(stay for the credits and try not to be caught at least a
little off guard!)as this film is,at its core it is little more than a
compendium of wild stories that guys have spun,whether based in truth
or no,set around giving their buddies and/or enduring their last night
of un-wedded fun. So while the originality of this particular movie
isn&#x27;t all that remarkable,the set-up,follow-through and denouement of
it is! Good,raunchy,raucous fun for anyone(guys in particular)who
appreciate good,solid immature tomfoolery before settling down and
&#x22;becoming mature&#x22;. Perfect film-going for summer!
