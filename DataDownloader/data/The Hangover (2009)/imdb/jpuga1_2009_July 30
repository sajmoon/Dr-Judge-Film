I&#x27;ve seen The Hangover twice, within a week, which is a first to me
especially with high ticket prices these days. It is absolutely the
funniest movie of the year and the only competition may come from its
sequel only. On both occasions that I&#x27;ve seen this, the whole audience
was LOLing for the majority of the film. I literally cried laughing at
the end of the film and most people did as well. What made this film so
enjoyable and hilarious? For me, it was the chemistry of the actors,
real life scenarios and troubles encountered with booze and drugs, and
the thought of good friends partying in fabulous Las Vegas. This is a
comedy you can watch over and over and still get the same reaction
every time. Simply genius!
