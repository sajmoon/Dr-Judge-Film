This movie is hands down the raunchiest and one of the funniest movies
i have ever seen. From the beginning of the movie right up to the end
it is consistently funny, there really are not any slow parts to this
movie because they are on a constant journey and race against time. And
just when you thought the movie couldn&#x27;t get any funnier the last 30
seconds of the movie slaps you across the face. I literally was
laughing so hard I cried.. I walked out of the theater feeling hungover
from an overdose of laughter, great time! <br /><br />Nothing more to say, spend the money to see this and you won&#x27;t regret
it!
