in years one of the best comedies I&#x27;ve seen from American soil, no dumb
boom bangs, no dumb teenagers, no dumb stars, actually spoken word and
this is done very well.. I&#x27;ve been to see this in theater and everybody
laughed.. <br /><br />don&#x27;t mind me wrong, but this is almost a story for X-files, as usually
if I&#x27;m trying to attend a movie, which was described as &#x22;comedy&#x22; most
of the people are turning their heads and don&#x27;t believe, how dumb you
must be laugh at it.. <br /><br />so people, go for it, its worth trying, you wont be disappointed, you
actually find out yourself laughing.. :) I give it a solid 9, a big
surprise for me..
