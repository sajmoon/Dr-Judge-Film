It raised a smile once or twice but the rest of it was predictable
high-school humour about a bunch of unlikeable men being ridiculously
irresponsible.<br /><br />One stupid mistake leads to a series of stupid mistakes and it goes on
and on and on ad nauseum. You don&#x27;t need me to explain the plot - it&#x27;s
all there in the trailers.<br /><br />No-one in the cast was particularly good except maybe for Heather
Graham (given the limited scope of the script). She, at least, was kind
of likable even if she veered into stereotype 40% of her screen time.<br /><br />Now I can understand why young people would like this: unable to summon
up the courage or the cash to pull this sort of crap themselves they
would enjoy living through this farce vicariously. I am fairly sure it
will only serve to embarrass them in 10 years time the same way Porkys
did for my generation.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this low level of creativity and poor humour can
pull big audiences but maybe this is the net result of the dumbing-down
of mainstream cinema over the last 20 years. Bums-on-seats can please
the shareholders and accountants but it&#x27;s a lousy motivation for any
sort of art-form.
