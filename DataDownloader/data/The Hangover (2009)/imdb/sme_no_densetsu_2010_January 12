&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is arguably the top comedy of 2009. The film defied
expectations to rake in millions of dollars on its way to becoming one
of the highest grossing R-rated films of all time. It even managed to
snag a Golden Globe nomination recently.<br /><br />However, while I wouldn&#x27;t argue against the enjoyability of &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; I find that in retrospect the film&#x27;s individual components
seem pretty average. Yet, somehow the film manages to become more than
the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The script is funny but not hilarious. Similarly, the actors bringing
the script to life are competent but mostly seem to be the budget
versions of more recognizable (and talented) actors.<br /><br />The storyline keeps us interested due to its unpredictable nature but
there&#x27;s nothing that really ties any of it together in a clever way.
This doesn&#x27;t really become apparent until we reach the end and see that
everything that preceded it was fairly arbitrary.<br /><br />The presentation is good enough with the direction servicing the story
and the soundtrack supporting the vibe but there&#x27;s nothing truly
outstanding there either.<br /><br />In short, this is a movie that somehow produces a winning combination
from commonplace elements. In the end, I&#x27;m doubtful about how the movie
will hold up to repeated viewings but it is undeniably enjoyable the
first time around.
