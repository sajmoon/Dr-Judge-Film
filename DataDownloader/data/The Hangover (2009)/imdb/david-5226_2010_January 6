Superb movie - but there will be very little enjoyment if a female was
seeing this flick - in most cases. <br /><br />Furthermore, guys - DON&#x27;T watch with your parents - it will be
EXTREMELY uncomfortable!<br /><br />The R rating info says little as to what&#x27;s actually in this film. This
film is seriously just a hair from a MA rating - not kidding. It does
say &#x22;Nudity&#x22; - but it should be &#x22;A-Lot of Nudity&#x22;. <br /><br />Overall, I&#x27;m a 24 year old guy and found this movie VERY enjoyable! <br /><br />I watched it with my mom and a bunch of friends (don&#x27;t know why - just
ran out and got this, heard it was &#x22;good&#x22;)- was a BAD IDEAD. L E A V E
T H E P A R E N T S O U T<br /><br />But, older guys will definitely find this movie hilarious.
