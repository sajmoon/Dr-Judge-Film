2009_June 3 
Saw this film last night and without a doubt, this is the funniest film
i have ever seen. It by far exceeded my expectations as thought it was
going to be a typical &#x27;bloke&#x27; film but from start to finish, I was
roaring up.<br /><br />There are many moments that are quite wrong and you feel slightly
concerned that you are laughing so hard....baby at the table
immediately springs to mind.....but this is a very clever comedy. No
detail is spared and every cast member has been cast perfectly.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t begin to recommend this film highly enough.<br /><br />GO SEE!!!
