Absolute coolness! Great movie, a must-own comedy. The way the story&#x27;s
told and portrayed is excellent. I&#x27;m trying to find a fault, but the
movie is pretty well balanced. Doesn&#x27;t bail out on the ending either
(Year One), this one follows thru right to the end. Has to be there at
the top of my top movies ever, and that&#x27;s a nuff said! I believe a
strong indicator of a movie&#x27;s success in popular culture is if people
clap at the ending. Last time I saw it happen was with Wanted, and this
movie is much stronger than Wanted in my opinion. This movie ended,
people just clapped. And that&#x27;s great! Now I&#x27;m not saying this is
foolproof - I liked The Mist ending, and people in the movies hated it
- but yeah, you get the drift. If not, open the windows! Bombo clat!
