A bromance movie following in the Hollywood tradition of recent years,
The Hangover stands at the crossroads between 2 Hollywood genres - the
&#x22;what stays in Vegas&#x22; movie, and the road trip movie, as 4 male friends
go away for a weekend of pre-wedding debauchery, but end up losing the
groom and the plot. Indeed director and co-writer Todd Phillips&#x27; first
feature was in fact 2000&#x27;s Road Trip, and his second was the hilarious
&#x27;Old School&#x27;, and it particularly shares the latter&#x27;s theme of
misbehaving buddies old enough to know better.<br /><br />The girls are an afterthought, either villains, super bitches, or sweet
caring and perfect like Heather Graham&#x27;s hot stripper/mom. But the
accusations of misogyny are missing the point. This movie&#x27;s not about
the girls, but the friendships between the dudes.<br /><br />If the territory is familiar, the execution is not without its&#x27; charms.
In particular, the charming weirdness of Alan, Tracy&#x27;s brother, with
his fat Jesus appearance and his sweet, innocent yet insane personality
(Zach Galifianakis) a counterpoint to the worldly cool of Bradly
Cooper&#x27;s Phil, and geeky dentist Stu (played by Ed Helms). These 3
musketeers spend most of the movie trying to piece together what
happens the night before (when Zach&#x27;s character accidentally slipped
them all a date rape drug instead of Ecstasy), which somehow involves a
real life tiger, an actual baby, a missing family heirloom/wedding ring
belonging to Stu, and the mysterious disappearance of their friend and
husband-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha).<br /><br />As road movies go, The Hangover is a fun ride, hitting all the right
notes with such fun ingredients, including a cameo from an air-drumming
Mike Tyson, but the film never quite lives up to its&#x27; potential, and is
likely to provoke laughter among the more literal-minded American
viewers at which it is aimed, as the US reviews of this movie largely
confirm. For the more discerning British viewer, however, some goofy
ingredients like a tiger, a hooker with a wedding ring and date rape
drugs will not compensate for the hit and miss humour of the movie, and
a slight shortage of wittier banter or richer characterisation. For me,
Phil isn&#x27;t enough of a bastard, Stu isn&#x27;t enough of a dork, and Alan
could be just a touch weirder - in the directors&#x27; similar former movie
Old School, the characters played by likes of Owen Wilsion, Will
Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are just bigger and brasher, making for more
fun. The Hangover, then ; like a great breakfast with some awesome
ingredients after a great, messy night out, only slightly undercooked.
