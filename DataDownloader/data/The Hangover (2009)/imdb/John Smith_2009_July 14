I definitely wouldn&#x27;t see &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; until who knows when if it
wasn&#x27;t for high rating on IMDb (top 250 even) that definitely made this
comedy more attention-attracting for me. Usually when a new comedy
comes out i don&#x27;t feel the urge to watch it right away, things like
that can really wait but &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; just couldn&#x27;t, and i&#x27;m glad it
didn&#x27;t...<br /><br />Plot doesn&#x27;t say much, the kind of plot we see very often in new
comedies, usually the ones that turn out to be nothing special but
rather &#x22;humor-forcing&#x22; load of crap. &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; is nothing like
that, they did do that whole thing with opening scene already at the
end of the movie and then &#x22;2 days ago&#x22; and stuff like that but that
didn&#x27;t really matter anyway for this movie. Main thing is that this
movie is laughable, very enjoyable and extremely entertaining comedy
that deserves its high rating and all the praising it gets because
summer-hit comedies like this one didn&#x27;t come in, i don&#x27;t know...10
years (&#x27;American Pie&#x27;)? Casting is brilliant, every actor totally gets
the right role and the one that i thought (at the start of the movie)
could be a bit boring and dreadful didn&#x27;t appear in the biggest part of
the movie. Mike Tyson appearance was funny, although Mike obviously
isn&#x27;t great actor he delivered some pure-core-laughter scene or two, &#x22;I
can feel it coming in the air tonight...&#x22; simply owns! By the way that
is also my favorite part of that song &#x27;In The Air Tonight&#x27; by Phil
Collins. If i had to pick the worst part of the movie (and i obviously
had one since i didn&#x27;t rate this movie with perfect 10) it would be the
ending, but before those extremely unique and rocking credits that just
give this &#x22;hangover&#x22; another big boost. Everybody out there should see
this movie as soon as possible, definitive undisputed &#x22;MUST SEE&#x22; summer
hit!
