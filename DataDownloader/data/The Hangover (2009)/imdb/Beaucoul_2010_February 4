Probably the worst picture of the year for me in terms of disappointed
expectations. I didn&#x27;t laugh once during the entire length of this
so-called comedy. Witless, charmless, without one likable character in
its ensemble cast, I was especially dumbfounded by the hype accorded to
Zach Galifianakis, whose lack of talent somehow manages to make Adam
Sandler look like a comic genius.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is obviously targeted to an audience who likes their
humor broad and sophomoric. To make matters worse, it relies heavily on
obnoxious stereotypes that are patently offensive.<br /><br />This piece of dreck utterly pales in comparison to a similar buddy
flick, the eminently watchable &#x22;I Love You, Man.&#x22; &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was an
utter waste of time and money. Caveat emptor.
