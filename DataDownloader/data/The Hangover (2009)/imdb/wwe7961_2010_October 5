This movie is comedic gold. It is filled with great characters, an
awesome setting, a great cast, and a well told story. Usually comedies
like this end up being not very good, but &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; does things to
make the formula funny.<br /><br />1.Acctually likable characters <br /><br />2.Acctually good actors <br /><br />3.An actually good script <br /><br />4.A mystery way of doing the comedy <br /><br />All the great things about the movie are made better by how all this
stupid stuff they are doing is unknown to us and to the characters. So
we learn along with them all the crazy stuff they did the night before.
It seems strange, but having he crazy stuff that happened not being
shown to us or remembered by the characters is more funny than us just
watching them doing the stupid stuff right in front of our faces. We
feel the same kind of surprise that they do, and that gives way more
laughs than if we just followed these guys through their night of being
drunk. Also I found myself very wrapped up in the mystery itself. Not
only was I laughing throughout, but I also really wanted to learn with
these guys what the did the night before. You feel like you were with
them in that one crazy night, and you want to find out everything that
happened too. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is much more than your average comedy. It
manages to breath life into the almost dead genre. This and
&#x22;Zombieland&#x22; are both excellent comedies from 09 that signal a possible
return of good quality hilarity.<br /><br />4 stars out of 4
