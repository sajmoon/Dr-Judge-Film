First I have to say that I hoped everyone was right and this would
really be a good comedy. It&#x27;s not.<br /><br />After reading so much praise I was expecting originality. Of course
there are some formulas every movie must follow but it must use it
cleverly and in a way not used before. They give us the conservative
guy, the adventurous guy and the insane guy. Did I forget the guy who
is about to get married? No, the screenwriters did that. He is boring
in a boring way.<br /><br />But what do they do with the rest of the dudes? Not much. Vegas is good
place for jokes and crazy stuff and we get both but is that enough? I
mean, the jokes were nothing special and the crazy stuff, well,
Enchanted had crazy stuff as well.<br /><br />This film never becomes bad nor good. It&#x27;s mediocre all the way. There
is a torture scene and it&#x27;s completely pointless. Cruelty must be used
with caution in a movie.<br /><br />I would have given it a 6 but there was a something in the film that
really annoyed me but other people probably won&#x27;t mind. Nevertheless, I
think a lot of people will enjoy this picture especially with company.
