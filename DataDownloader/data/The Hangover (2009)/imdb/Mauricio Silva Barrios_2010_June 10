This movie is hard to evaluate. It has some very good points, but it is
not as great as it might sound. It&#x27;s just good. The story is creative,
with weird and curious mysteries to be unveiled. Although not at a slow
pace, the film goes at a slower pace than it should, considering the
various things happening. Most mysteries are explained, but the things
done by the characters are not believable. Most things that are
supposed to be funny are just plain dummy. So, in the end, this is a
pretty average work. It&#x27;s well produced, as expected from a Hollywood
movie. An average movie with a creative story. All I can say is that
they wasted a good opportunity to make a great movie.
