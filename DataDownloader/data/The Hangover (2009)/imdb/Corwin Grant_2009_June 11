Funny and at times over the top (especially those jokes involving the
baby). It&#x27;s defiantly worth seeing in the theater. I had a number of
good laughs and with the audience response it was a little better.
Don&#x27;t expect reality here - it&#x27;s one long skit of sight gags. But
that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s intended to be. If you can suspend your disbelief (and
you will need to to get past the obviously unrealistic events), get
past the fact that there&#x27;s really not much of a plot, some
stereo-typical garbage, and just enjoy the laughs you&#x27;ll like this
movie. I thought the acting was sufficient. One warning, its definitely
not for kids.
