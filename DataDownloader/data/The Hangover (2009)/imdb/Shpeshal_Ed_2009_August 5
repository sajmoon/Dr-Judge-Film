Honestly the funniest movie since Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Right up
with it, and 40 Year Old Virgin.<br /><br />Has a completely different comedic style to the majority of the Apatow
inspired comedies of the last few years (not that there&#x27;s anything
wrong with Judd&#x27;s films). But at the same time, totally different, and
MUCH better than Old School.<br /><br />Galifianakis is brilliant, and the cameos fit in perfectly. Even the
way in which the protagonists piece together the events of the previous
night is well woven and not disjointed in any way. It&#x27;s been superbly
put together.<br /><br />Just a great great comedy.
