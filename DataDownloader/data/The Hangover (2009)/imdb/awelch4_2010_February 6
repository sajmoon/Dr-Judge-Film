I didn&#x27;t like this movie which wasted my time. It was like a 90 minute
beer commercial featuring dumb male football fans. The plot is
preposterous and non-funny. The characters are jerks. One unhappily
married guy keeps lying to his wife. One guy is knocked cold by Mike
Tyson. The group doesn&#x27;t know where they&#x27;ve been and run around in a
stolen police car, pay ransom to an Asian gang, etc. Plot, silly.
Acting poor. Not an inspiration for young people. Irrisponsible. A good
film requires either romance, adventure, conflict, mystery or comical
talent. None of these ingredients will be found here. Don&#x27;t bother with
this one. In order to meet the required ten lines I&#x27;ll add another
review. Requiring ten lines of comment without making this a spoiler id
idiotic thinking and I&#x27;ll probably never use this movie site again.
