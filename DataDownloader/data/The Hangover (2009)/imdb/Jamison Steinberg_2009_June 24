The Hangover is one of those rare gems that surprise you. Not much hype
for this movie, but once the trailer hit the theaters advertising &#x22;From
the guy who brought you Old School&#x22;, I was ready for a hilarious
comedy. And a hilarious comedy is what I got. Right from the beginning
of the film, the story sucks you in and makes you wonder, &#x22;What the
hell happened?&#x22; And so they begin to explain. Everything. You just have
to be patient. The best character that just had me laughing so hard was
Adam, played by Zach Galifianakis. A bit of a newcomer when it comes to
films, but definitely has what it takes for a successful career in
Hollywood. Go see this film. Then go see it again because you&#x27;ll miss a
lot of the movie the first time around because of extreme laughter.
