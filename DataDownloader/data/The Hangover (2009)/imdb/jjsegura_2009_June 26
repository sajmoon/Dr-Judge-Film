2009_June 26 
Similar to actors, when a director puts out several movies that I enjoy
(e.g.; Eastwood, Spielberg, Bay, etc.), I tend to follow their projects
closely. Not only their current projects, but also their future ones.
Phillips is the next great director and his genre is comedies. His
first movie I enjoyed was Road Trip (2000) which he then followed with
what I considered not only his personal best, but probably the funniest
movie of my generation Old School (2003). These were followed by a
couple of so-so movies Starsky &#x26; Hutch (2004) and School for Scoundrels
(2006). These two were not terrible, just not up to par with his prior
gems. Well, my friends, Phillips is back and with a bang with The
Hangover. Unlike his prior movies, there are no bona fide star, but I
can assure you that this movie will launch the four main characters,
Cooper, Galifianakis, Helms and Bartha, into stardom. The movie has a
simple premise; four friends go to Vegas to celebrate a bachelor party
only to have everything go completely wrong. Like that hasn&#x27;t been done
before. But what makes this film special is that from the time you sit
down to watch the movie, until the very end (make sure you stay for the
credits), you are laughing non-stop. The dialog, the situations, etc.
had me laughing hysterically. The other thing that makes this movie
great is that even after you leave the theater, you might be watching
TV, working or doing some other activity, a couple of lines from the
movie will cross your mind and you&#x27;ll start laughing again. That is
what I consider a great movie. When you think about a movie and enjoy
it as if you were watching it. Of course the movie is not for everyone,
as Phillips tends to push the envelope (some people may consider some
of the scenes offensive), but I think it really works. This movie won&#x27;t
win any Oscars, but others will now be following Mr. Phillips&#x27; career
very closely.
