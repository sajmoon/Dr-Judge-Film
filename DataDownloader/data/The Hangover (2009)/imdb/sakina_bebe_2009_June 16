When i first saw the trailer my friends and i decide to watch the
movie. This has to be one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve seen in a long
time. For anyone who is prudish and can&#x27;t tell by what the movie is
rated or by the title of the movie, don&#x27;t see. For anyone who has a
sense of humor... you have to see this movie!!Funnier than Old School,
Wedding Crashers, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad put
together ( maybe im laying it on a little bit) I was not at all
expecting it to be this funny... go see it, its worth the money. And
Omg i still can believe how hot is Bradley Cooper even in a movie like
that he was so funny and handsome like always the whole movie i went
was for him. Finally its an hilarious movie , u cant miss this movie!!
