This movie was brilliant on so many different levels. It had humorous
moments from almost every character which tends to be rare in most
comedies. There always tends to be one person that carries everyone
else. Though Zach (Alan) was the most funny of the characters, he did
not carry the whole movie. It was funny all around and I was very glad
to see a good comedy this summer, seeing as how Land of the Lost was
somewhat lacking. The Hangover had so many different things going on
that it is a movie worth watching more than once. I, personally, went
to see this film twice and I will for sure be purchasing it when it
comes to DVD. This is a definite must-see movie of the summer!
