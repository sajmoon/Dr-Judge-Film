This movie made me laugh even at times when I didn&#x27;t fully understand
why. So for that I am grateful &#x26; got my money&#x27;s worth. I look forward
to the DVD with its deleted scenes etc. The central trio of the movie
are such a sad sack bunch of losers they really look funny without
having to say or do anything. I also appreciated some of the supporting
characters: Heather Graham who deserves better parts, the Asian dude
who sparked up events, &#x26; even Mike Tyson who I normally would not like
at all. Plus the baby Carlos who was so cute.I liked the ending
especially with the series of photographs which goes a long way to
explain what happened.
