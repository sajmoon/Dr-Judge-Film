The Hangover is about four guys who go to Vegas for a bachelor party.
In all recent comedy fashion and just what you would expect from the
title, these guys wake up, after having spent a night of being blown
out of their minds in Vegas. Unfortunately, one of the guys is missing
and they start out on a terribly misguided adventure to find out where
he is.<br /><br />So in other words, The Hangover follows the formula of Dude Where&#x27;s My
Car, with comedy that is overall more shocking and less about stupid
comedy and more about shock comedy. If you can let yourself go for a
little while, and try not to think about the thousands of moral
implications brought on by the storyline, then you&#x27;re liable to enjoy
some good dirty fun, and one of the funniest comedy movies this
century.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some down sides. This movie really is ONLY
about the misadventures brought about by their actions from the night
before, nothing deep or meaningful here. While you do have to let
yourself go every once in a while, it&#x27;s a shame the movie didn&#x27;t take
more of a shot at the corrupt morals it takes to ruin your life in
Vegas, and simply promotes Sin City&#x27;s decadence of stupid young twenty
something lifestyle being played out by mid thirty aged actors.<br /><br />That being said, the actors do a great job. The shining role here is
played by Zach Galifianakis, as the brother of the bride, and his lines
of really screwed up shock comedy, rather than every other actor in the
movie. Ultimately the second best actor is the guy you see the least
of, the groom.<br /><br />The Hangover is good for some nice, not so clean, fun. Basically it is
what it sells, and that is what every other after-the-party comedy
sells, and that&#x27;s decadence in a lifestyle that really isn&#x27;t that
great. Still, let yourself go, and you&#x27;ll find some belly busting
laughter several times at this movie.
