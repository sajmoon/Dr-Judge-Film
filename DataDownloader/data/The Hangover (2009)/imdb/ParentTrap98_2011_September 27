2011_September 27 
It was a girls night out, and we were having so much fun. We decided to
go see a movie, I was dying to see the latest children&#x27;s family film,
but my girlfriends insisted on seeing this film that for some reason
got such great reviews. I was very uncomfortable about the idea of
somebody getting intoxicated, but too the point of not remembering is
just awful. Well I made 10 minutes into it, and those were the worst 10
minutes of my life. Within the time frame I heard more swear words than
I&#x27;ve ever heard before, saw more nudity than I see with my husband, and
had the worst feeling watching these sinful people. I leaned over to my
friend Abby and told her she could find me elsewhere (in the theater
for Land of the Lost); because no way in Jesus&#x27; holy name was I
watching this movie for another minute. I enjoyed that (Land of the
Lost) a whole lot more, and when they (my so called friends) came out
laughing at me, saying it was the funniest movie ever, I told them they
better repent come Sunday, and I haven&#x27;t spoken to them since then...
Worst. Movie. Ever.
