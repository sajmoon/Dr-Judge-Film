well basically, seen it, was a decent movie, 7/10.. nothing special,
was definitely not up to par with pineapple express or half baked or
anything like that, but was a decent mildly funny movie, nothing
special really.<br /><br />The Hangover is currently 8.4/10 20,849 votes on IMDb, which of course
is not a realistic rating for this movie that isn&#x27;t even as funny as
the naked gun movies (which i enjoyed, but they weren&#x27;t movie classics
like IMDb rating system makes this out to be) , &#x22;Fear And Loathing In
Las Vegas&#x22; was definitely a top level comedy, just so you know my
tastes in all these movies to help you tell just where this movie
deserves to be in relation.<br /><br />sure the jokes were vulgar and such but i ain&#x27;t gonna hate on an artist
for expressing creativity or be wild since im a south park and family
guy fan.<br /><br />i think everyone is just hyped and in a good mood for summer and their
all in good moods, that would be my guess anyways, or maybe the movie
makers spent a lotta movie to hire people to enter fake IMDb ratings, i
really don&#x27;t know, but take my word for it, this movie is generic and
mildly funny, decently entertaining, but nothing special that hasn&#x27;t
been done by 100000 other generic comedies before it, and thats the
truth of the matter.
