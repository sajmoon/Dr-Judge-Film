Very few moments of this movie are funny. There. I said it. I&#x27;m all for
comedy--and raunchy comedy at that--but there was NOTHING funny about
this movie. I wasn&#x27;t intoxicated. Was that the problem? Couldn&#x27;t be.
Even respected critics are hailing this movie. I determined that one of
the many problems I had with this movie was the cast. I&#x27;m not a fan of
any of the actors so I guess this experience was doomed from the start.
Not many comedies are in IMDb&#x27;s top 250 and this one especially doesn&#x27;t
belong. But, hey, what do I know... I can go on and tell you but
knowledge and logic would be out of place here.<br /><br />Cheers!
