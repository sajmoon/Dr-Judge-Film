I have just seen the movie and I have to admit that this is the best
comedy so far this year. Every minute is a belly hurting lough with
witty and smart gags. Acting is brilliant guys really get in to their
roles. Trailer that was shown before does stand up for whole movie. If
you tend to wake up in the morning not remembering things you did last
night you have to see this film as it will reflect yourself!!Overral
movie is a excellent pieac of comedy that will blow your mind with lots
of jokes and amazing acting. If you looking for a easy movie to watch
and don&#x27;t want anything deep and meaning go and watch this film as it
is pure fun and you will not regret any minute spend afront of the big
screen. Enjoy
