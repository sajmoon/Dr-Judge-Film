2009_June 20 
First off, we were a bit reluctant to see this movie after reading its
plot summary but the rating (8.4 at the time) and all the positive user
comments made us give this movie a chance.<br /><br />Needless to say, we regret doing so.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a mistake. Perhaps this movie should have been given 4.8
instead of 8.4 and even this would be too generous, in my opinion. The
movie is not only a clich&#xE9; of Hollywood bachelor&#x27;s night &#x27;what happens
in Vegas, stays in Vegas&#x27; type of films, but 99.9% of the jokes were
either tasteless or completely predictable. The actors did not even do
a remotely good job and the screenplay writers did absolutely nothing
to help them along the way.<br /><br />I still want someone to explain to me what was so different about this
movie..
