I have just had the dubious pleasure of watching &#x27;The Hanover&#x27;, a film
that was recommended to me by virtually all of my work colleagues. Let
me start by saying &#x27; this is the first time that I have written a
comment on IMDb&#x27;, a website that I use as &#x27;the bible&#x27; of movie going.
Notice I use the word &#x27;comment&#x27; and not &#x27;review&#x27;, basically because
,there is nothing to review here. This has to be the worst comedy(?)
that I have ever seen! Please avoid at all costs ! I am only giving it
one star because I think that Mike Tyson&#x27;s performance is worthy of
some praise. I really can&#x27;t see why this is film is so popular ! I
thought I was sitting down to watch another &#x27;Sideways&#x27;, instead I
witnessed 2 hours of mindless rubbish ! I appreciate this will not be a
popular view but there are times when one feels compelled to speak out
against the mainstream. Finally, if there is anyone out there that
hasn&#x27;t seen this movie, my advice would be to watch &#x27; Burn After
Reading &#x27; instead .... The funniest black comedy of the year !
