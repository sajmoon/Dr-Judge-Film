Let me just get this out of the way: The Hangover is one of the
funniest films I have ever seen. So original, hilarious and wonderful.
Tons of one-liners and immensely quotable. Lines like &#x22;She&#x27;s got my
grandmother&#x27;s Holocaust ring!&#x22; &#x22;I didn&#x27;t know they gave out rings at
the Holocaust.&#x22; make this movie so wonderful. Every scene is almost
always stolen by Alan Garner, played so well by Zach Galifiniakis.
Every actor plays off each other in a seamless way. This is not a real
subtle, &#x22;smart&#x22; comedy, but it is so awesome that it doesn&#x27;t have to
be. There are so many great lines and scenes in this movie that when
your still laughing at one line, another comes up and you laugh harder,
overlapping each line and making you feel so fantastic. This is a
wonderful, hilarious and really push-forward comedy that makes you
wonder if something like &#x22;The 40-Year Old Virgin&#x22; was really that good
(it still is).<br /><br />10/10
