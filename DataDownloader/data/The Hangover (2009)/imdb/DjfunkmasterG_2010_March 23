I wouldn&#x27;t say I outright hated it,but I don&#x27;t think it deserves the
hype it has gotten, but it has its moments.<br /><br />The Hangover, the newest feature comedy from Todd Phillips has hit the
scene. Although I am a year behind in getting to this my super busy
schedule has kept me from seeing films as much as I would like.<br /><br />I thought the film had some good moments, and some fun moments, but
there wasn&#x27;t any GREAT moments, not at least until the end credits
rolled, and I don&#x27;t mean that as a snide against the film in that the
end credits rolling is the best thing, but it is because of what is
contained within the end credits. Those moments are what i felt should
have occurred.<br /><br />I will say Bradley Cooper was aptly cast and did an excellent job, in
fact the 3 leads were mixed appropriately, I just think they needed a
bit stronger mass of material.<br /><br />I hope what occurs in the credits is what makes up the Sequel when it
films, but as of right now I would merely suggest it if you have
nothing better to watch that night.
