The Hangover is, proudly, a film that does not follow the footsteps of
those college and break up films, like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and
Old School, that is being overused nowadays and is rapidly becoming a
bore but now we have a dirty, rude, hilarious film called &#x22;THE
HANGOVER&#x22;. It is one of those films that seem worthless but,
instantaneously, from the first scene becomes a destined classic comedy
that takes up your number one spot on your top 5 comedy list. It is a
film with a stupid plot that quickly changes into a film with, matter
of fact, unbelievable twists and action, not to mention the slick,
hilarious, continuous sick stunts and jokes. The film was probably the
most deserving of its award at the Oscars for best comedy or musical
because with a movie like this, it can definitely go wrong, in a good
way. One extra award should have been given out for Zach Galifianakis
for his priceless role as Alan Garner (P.S I am definitely not
exaggerating when I say that he should have won an Oscar. Damn you
Oscars!!!!!) Todd Phillips is my new director to look at out for and
he, obviously, has some great films under his title. Here I come Road
Trip! A director like him is very rare nowadays because he is someone
who never hides or thinks something is inappropriate for the eyes. He
is one of a kind. His camera angles are impeccable. The acting cast did
a brilliant job of making this riot come to life and the four main
actors were perfect for their roles. I haven&#x27;t seen much of Bradley
Cooper on film, with the exception of He&#x27;s Just Not That In To You
(which he acted great in), but after watching him in The Hangover I
have to say that this man has some great talent to show-off. He left a
great impression on me and I have to get The a-Team just for him.
Bradley Cooper is playing Phil Wenneck, a school teacher who has the
&#x22;same maturity level as his students when he is with his pals&#x22;, is one
of the unlucky friend that goes to Vegas for the (worst) two days of
his life. Ed Helms is, surprisingly, quite funny for a geeky dentist
that can get pretty wild at parties, especially when he is drunk, and
he looks tougher than he actually is. He is another unfortunate soul.
Ed Helms has a great transformation from a dentist who is under the
rule of his soon-to-be fianc&#xE9;e to a newly made man. In real life Ed
Helms is quite cool and with playing a dentist with no balls, he is
someone to look out for. Justin Bartha (National Treasure I and II) is
Doug Billings, a soon-to-be husband who is ready for the time of his
life, too bad he didn&#x27;t see this whole thing coming. Justin Bartha has
changed a lot from the last time we saw him in National Treasure. He
still felt a little out of his place. The Main Star of the show is Zach
Galifianakis who plays the hilarious Alan Garner, the brother in law of
Doug Phillips, and who has an addiction for trusting druggies. The
whole sh*toad of trouble starts when he puts Roofies into each glass of
wine that he brought from a druggie who seemed trustworthy. He is the
landmark of stupid/funny characters in films like these that the
laughter flows out from. He is the fat part of this film and also the
immaturity as well. I do not know how Zach made this guy come to life
and how he gathered up all the energy? Anyways, Zach is a gifted actor
that belongs into the Mensa of films. Well done! The rest of the cast
is history......<br /><br />Since the plot is too complicated and funny to comprehend, I took the
liberty of copying this straight from IMDb: Just two days before his
marriage with Tracy Garner, Doug Billings, in the company of two
friends: Phil Wenneck and Stu Price; and Tracy&#x27;s eccentric brother,
Alan, head out to party in Vegas. Driving his father&#x27;s Mercedez, they
rent a pricey villa at Caesar&#x27;s and head for the rooftop to have a good
time. Three of them later wake up with a hangover, unable to re-collect
what exactly happened. With the villa in a wreck, turned upside down,
they find that they have a baby in the closet, a grown tiger in the
bathroom, Stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride, and Doug is
missing. Hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to re-trace their
steps, find out that occurred in order to try and locate Doug, and
bring him home in one piece before the wedding.<br /><br />The film has a cameo by Mike Tyson who is a fierce little fella and he
lights the screen on fire once he makes an appearance. The punch must
have hurt when Alan got it! The film has too many classic scenes and it
would be very hard, if not impossible, to choose one but there are some
scenes which stand out from the rest. The whole Alan making the baby
look like it is jerking off is stuck in my mind for days and I laugh
whenever it is thought off. I laugh in the classroom in sleep, even in
the toilet. The Ending, which I won&#x27;t certainly not spoil, is also very
funny because it outlines the stupidity that the bunch had to go
through after realizing......... (lets leave it at that.) The film
amazes me when I think of the R18+ rating it got because the film had
hardly any nudity to what you might expect but the foul language and
the offensive acts fill that up in a flash. This is a must recommend
for Comedy fans who are looking for the word &#x22;Originality&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;Over and Out&#x22; 10th June, 2010.
