After a wild bachelor party, 3 friends wake up in a destroyed room and
discover that their friend, the groom, is missing. Now they must
re-trace their steps from the night that they can&#x27;t remember in order
to get him back to the wedding the next day.<br /><br />This premise is just an excuse for some wild and random comedic
scenarios, such as having a tiger be in your bathroom when you wake up.
The joy of watching this film is seeing just how many crazy things come
next, all of which the characters have no memory of. What makes The
Hangover work so well, is not just those random comedic scenarios, but
the cast that blended so well together. Specifically Zach Galifianakis,
whom has been the audience favourite.<br /><br />As the film progresses, the characters find themselves getting into
some serious situations due to their antics the night before. I want
say what happens, as each one if funny and should be watched with
surprise. It easy to say that this film will not bore you. It does have
a particular comedic style though and you can judge yourself if you&#x27;ll
be into it or not from the trailer. <br /><br />Todd Phillips, of Oldschool fame, has his funniest movie here. Both
Road Trip and Oldschool were good, yet were missing something that made
me really love it. The Hangover has this something. It&#x27;s not a teen
comedy (road trip) nor is it a star powered film (old school). It uses
familiar faces that make you go &#x22;I&#x27;ve seen him before&#x22; but never do
these actors overshadow the film. Had it of been a bigger name cast it
wouldn&#x27;t have worked so well.<br /><br />The three friends are played by Ed Helms, the uptight dentist, Bradley
Cooper, the suave smooth talker, and Zach Galifianakis, the odd brother
in law. The groom is played by Justin Bartha, the National Treasure
sidekick. It&#x27;s easy to say the Galifianakis steals the show. It&#x27;s
obvious he will garner more roles from this, I just hope he doesn&#x27;t get
pigeon-holed into this style. He reminds me of Chi McBride and I want
him to branch out before it&#x27;s too late (Michael Cera). Helms and Cooper
also hold up nicely, I&#x27;m familiar with Helms from The Office and Daily
Show fame and Cooper from previous films has always been likable.
Bartha isn&#x27;t in the film that much, since most of it is them looking
for the guy.<br /><br />The Hangover also doesn&#x27;t suffer from the one thing that seems to kill
so many comedies. Over exposed trailer. Yes we&#x27;ve all seen the Mike
Tyson bit, but the film has so many random bits of comedy that you will
enjoy yourself throughout the running time. If the film does fault,
it&#x27;s with the character of Mr. Chow. I like Ken Jeong, but here he
plays the character way over the top and it becomes distracting.
Heather Graham makes an appearance as well and as she does with almost
every role she takes on, you see her boobies. Well, one boob.<br /><br />The film is funny, I was entertained, and I expect to see good things
from Galifianakis. It&#x27;s vulgar and obscene and don&#x27;t expect to see much
heart near the end or a good message, like Apatow films do. While it
does have that one scene in which one character stands up for himself,
it doesn&#x27;t try to throw any real messages out the audience.<br /><br />Make sure you stay for the first bit of the credits, as the laughs
don&#x27;t stop.
