This is a good movie, not great, but good. The movie has an offbeat
story with an interesting twist, almost like a whodunit except that
here it&#x27;s a &#x22;what happened.&#x22; Although the story has its amusing
moments, it is not uproariously funny. Actually, the movie worked
better when showing how three fellows are following up on all kinds of
strange and weird clues to figure out what happened to them. There is a
lot of slap stick, reminiscent of The Three Stooges, and if you like
the Three Stooges style of comedy, then this movie will make you laugh.
The funniest character is the Chinese guy played by Ken Jeong whose
acting is definitely over the top and is a scene stealer. The three
lead characters are amusing but do not come close to generating
anything approximating a real loud guffaw. The best part of the movie
are the end credits, which says something about the celluloid that
preceded it.
