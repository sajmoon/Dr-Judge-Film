I am a teenager, and every day at school kids would talk non stop about
The Hangover. How funny it was, etc. I finally got the time to watch it
and was very disappointed. I expected the movie to be the greatest
comedy of all time. Instead, I got a moderate comedy with a bad story
line.<br /><br />The plot for the movie is very unoriginal. They copied Dude, Where&#x27;s My
Car? and a Simpsons episode ( Homer and Ned travel to Las Vegas with
hilarious consequences.) The flashbacks were very clich&#xE9;d and not
funny.<br /><br />Their were a few jokes in here that made me chuckle, but not laugh.
Zach Galifinafkis had a very unfunny part, and Bradley Cooper didn&#x27;t
have any funny jokes, neither was Stu.<br /><br />I expected a great comedy, but got a flopper. Did I expect too much
with this movie, or did I just not get how this movie was a
masterpiece?
