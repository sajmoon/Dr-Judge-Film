Without any doubt this was definitely one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve
ever seen. Don&#x27;t expect a cinematic masterpiece but if you&#x27;re looking
forward to an entertaining movie full of unpredictable jokes and
situations this could be it.<br /><br />The Hangover tells the story of four guys who take off to Las Vegas for
a bachelor party. After a tough night they don&#x27;t remember anything and
above all is the groom-to-be missing. The other three men start
reconstructing their passed night, trying to find their lost friend.<br /><br />The extremely funny story is supported by well-known and very
entertaining music as well as by the impressive and beautiful scenery
of Nevada and the famous city of Las Vegas. All of the mainly male
characters play a superb and distinctive role.<br /><br />I recommend this comedy to everyone who hasn&#x27;t laughed in a while,
enjoys American movies full of jokes and doesn&#x27;t get offended by harsh
language. Enjoy yourself!
