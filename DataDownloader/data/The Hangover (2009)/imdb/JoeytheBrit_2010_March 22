I enjoyed this daft comedy well enough, but it isn&#x27;t the funniest film
to recently come out of Hollywood &#x96; in fact it would probably struggle
to make it into the top three even though it serves up a regular supply
of laughs. I suppose that&#x27;s the trouble with funny trailers &#x96; they tend
to be a double-edged sword because they draw the people into the cinema
but fail to achieve the level of laughs suggested by the trailer that
many might expect. The film follows the misadventures of a group of
average guys on the stag night of one of them who goes missing
following a night that none of them can remember. The guys wake up in
their trashed penthouse villa with monster hangovers and discover a
tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a cupboard.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the guys here weren&#x27;t sex-crazy teens but
thirty-somethings with the attendant baggage a few more years under the
belt inevitably brings, even though it fails to sidestep some clich&#xE9;d
situations. The film goes out of its way to undermine preconceived
notions: the funny cops are also sadistic and vindictive, the outwardly
respectable girlfriend is a foul-mouthed harridan who cheats on her
partner while the seasoned Vegas stripper/escort is a sweet girl, Mike
&#x27;ear-biter&#x27; Tyson (who I feel comfortable saying is looking decidedly
porky these days, seeing as he is more than an ocean&#x27;s distance away
from me as I type this) is a good guy, the vicious villain is camp and
weedy, and so on. It&#x27;s no doubt a strategy to keep things fresh, and it
works for the most part. The four friends make a likable bunch, even as
they bicker and fight, and the mystery at the core of the film means
that the pace only occasionally flags.
