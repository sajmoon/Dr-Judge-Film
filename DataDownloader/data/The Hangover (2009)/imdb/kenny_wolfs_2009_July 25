2009_July 25 
I just returned from the theater where I saw &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;, and I must
admit, with what I saw from it first, I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen it myself,
but a very foxy lady (Italian, redhead, and a nice rack) asked me if I
wanted to see that one, and any guy will know that if a girl like that
asks you out, SHE chooses the movie. Awaiting her arrival, I met my
cousin up front, and he told me he thought&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was that chick
flick. After just watching the film for 2 minutes, Bradley Cooper
appeared on the screen and my date said &#x22;Oh God, he&#x27;s so hot, that&#x27;s
the reason why I wanted to see the film&#x22;. At this point, I didn&#x27;t
really think this movie was going to be something, but soon I had to
review my opinion.<br /><br />The humour in this movie for starters is of different levels. There is
the sexual innuendo/teen-humour, there are crazy and absurd situations,
there is some slapstick, basically, whatever humour you favour, this
movie has got it. You&#x27;ll laugh at some point in the film.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie gives you a great feeling. It really somehow
has that vibe of &#x22;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#x22;, where you also had
the feeling that you wanted to experience the same fun the actors in
that movie had. You just feel like you&#x27;re on a &#x22;magical ride&#x22; with
them, and you regret not being there in real life.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are really worked out nicely, both by the
screenplay as well as the actors. Hot shot of the evening, Bradley
Cooper, really gave me the impression like he was an incredible fun
person to be around with, and I&#x27;d definitely want Phil (his character
in the movie) to be my friend in real life. Zach Galifianakis (Alan)
plays a great annoying little moron too. In the beginning of the movie
you hate him, and you&#x27;d wish they dump him in the desert, but he
manages to win you over by his at least good nature.<br /><br />A nice addition to the movie is Ken Jeong who plays a (probably) gay
leader of the Chinese mafia who seems obsessed by imitating Western
(African-American) slang and manners. Normally I&#x27;m not too fond of
Asian actors, but this one really give the movie extra humour.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t let a weak trailer keep you from seeing this movie. I&#x27;ve enjoyed
it immensely, and had quite a few laughs, while I&#x27;m usually not the
kind to break out in laughter.
