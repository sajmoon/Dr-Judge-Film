The intelligent comedy is a dying breed. Gone are the days of the Marx
Brothers and good Woody Allen movies; here are the days of Meet the
Spartans, farting and cameos from Carmen Electra. It&#x27;s relieving, than,
that in this current dark period of desperate cinematic comedy, great
movies like The Hangover are still being made.<br /><br />The Hangover proves that there is still genius to be derived from the
unsophisticated: this isn&#x27;t routine slacker/bromance fodder; this
doesn&#x27;t sacrifice all its integrity for a flurry of puke-awful penis
jokes. It carries itself with the wit of a sitcom and the flare of the
big screen, resulting in the funniest mainstream comedy of the year
thus far (I said mainstream, In the Loop, so don&#x27;t worry).<br /><br />Todd Phillips has outdone himself this time, because The Hangover is
his best film to date. Though, given his last outing was School for
Scoundrels, that mightn&#x27;t be saying much in terms of personal vigour,
but his latest trumps a lot of America&#x27;s recent comedic output.<br /><br />It&#x27;s become a recent fad in cinema to compare almost every American
comedy to the work of Judd Apatow, a more mature (but not quite as
legendary) Kevin Smith. Following his rise to fame, his movies have
conquered the hearts of cinema-goers, pleasing both the box office and
critics. So, how do comparisons with The Hangover hold up? Well, if
Apatow is an auteur for finding hilarity in the mundane, or deadly
serious (unplanned pregnancy, heartbreak, etc.), than Phillips is the
master for creating comic genius from the completely insane.<br /><br />In fact, the only thing that&#x27;s even remotely similar to Apatow&#x27;s frame
of work is the layered character observations, because what&#x27;s
significantly exceptional about The Hangover, and that indefinable
quality that made and didn&#x27;t break it, is that it&#x27;s very taken with its
characters. Rather than constantly busy itself with an excessive drive
of punchlines, it&#x27;s very involved in the surprisingly acute development
of our illustrious trio&#x27;s relationship, and frequently reaches
breakthroughs in terms of simpatico. An oddball (Zach Galifianakis&#x27;
Alan), a lothario (Bradley Cooper&#x27;s Phil), and a neurotic (Ed Helms&#x27;
Stu) they may be, these characters are still very investible and very
believable, and given the ludicrous events that transpire during the
movie&#x27;s runtime, that&#x27;s pretty impressive.<br /><br />Though that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t yield many a punchline; in fact,
the gag rate is unfathomable, and, on average, there&#x27;s a joke every few
seconds. Even more impressively, for every joke that misfires, there
are two that hit home, to hilarious effect.<br /><br />But going back to characterization, it brings me nicely to the
performances; what&#x27;s refreshing about The Hangover is it&#x27;s neither the
first comedic outing for a major actor, nor does it&#x27;s cast consist of
the usual humdrum SNL affiliates. While the primary trio are seasoned,
it&#x27;s great to see some different faces appose to the norm. And, boy,
you wouldn&#x27;t want this cast any other way.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper as Phil is cocksure charisma winningly applied to an
everyman the average schmo can both like, empathize with and, similar
to Galifianakis&#x27; Alan, somewhat idolize. He&#x27;s slick, he&#x27;s suave, and
he&#x27;s no slouch when it comes to punchlines, and, thanks to his leading
man good looks, he&#x27;s enough to bother Ryan Reynolds, and just as
talented. Given that he&#x27;s never really given a definable moment to
shine, his insanity, compared to his co-stars, is admirably low-key,
but, sadly, he is upstaged by both Helms and Galifianakis.<br /><br />Ed Helms, one of the most underrated and scandalously underused comedic
actors to recently come about, fits the role of Stu perfectly, which is
a pleasant surprise; fans of his will probably be more acquainted with
the many self-serving, idiotic assholes that have shaped his frame of
work so far. Hats off to Phillips for giving him the attention and
limelight he deserves, because it was definitely worth it; watch Helms
throughout, and you&#x27;ll see how his increasingly-frustrated Stu begins
to squirm. The character&#x27;s outbursts mightn&#x27;t come as quite a surprise
as a result, but you&#x27;ll still be able to watch a maverick subtly begin
to take centre stage. If, however, you don&#x27;t have the tolerance to do
so, than simply laugh your ass off at his piano/voice solo midway
through the movie, and particularly his rib-tickling fermata.<br /><br />And, finally, Zach Galifianakis... It&#x27;s not difficult to identify which
aspect steals the show; Galifianakis as Alan turns in a comedy tour du
force; thanks to Galifianakis&#x27; undivided dedication to manic
vivaciousness, and the innocent, dumb grace he inhibits the character
with, Alan is the unfaltering focus of a very devoted audience, all of
whom should be waiting for his next hilarious pratfall or observation
(you can&#x27;t masturbate on a plane because of 9/11, apparently). He is
endlessly funny, and just never wears thin.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not everything is as steady; there&#x27;s a hammy Ken Jeong,
who, after one funny moment, just becomes plain irritating. Also, the
film fancies itself both a comedy and a mystery movie, but the
characters&#x27; sleuthing grows a little monotonous as things proceed.
Every twist is very predictable, and while some scenes do offer
legitimate pathos (the scene in the impound lot, for example), others
just deter from the general interest. Thankfully, the movie is
deliriously fast-paced and doesn&#x27;t fret too much therein.<br /><br />And you yourself should not fret, because there&#x27;s more than enough here
to entertain and enthrall: three supporting players finally getting a
stab at lead; a wonderful high concept used to its fullest potential,
not to mention a great depiction of the title ailment; such
unprecedented delights as a taser gun demonstration with two
over-enthusiastic cops, a winking Rain Man spoof with a great and
well-publicized use of the song &#x22;Joker &#x26; the Thief&#x22;, and a rooftop
speech from Alan that had me in stitches long after the movie was over.
