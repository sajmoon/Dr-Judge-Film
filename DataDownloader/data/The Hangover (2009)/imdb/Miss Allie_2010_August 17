This movie is not a good movie for people who cannot stand foul
language and rude, sexual humour.<br /><br />It had funny parts and Zach Galifianakis (Alan) was the funniest
character and Bradley Cooper&#x27;s (Phil) expression to Alan&#x27;s character
was laughable, but that&#x27;s where it ends for me.<br /><br />This movie is no where near appropriate a comedy to watch with the
family.<br /><br />I hope one day to find a great comical movie that is not dirty,
inappropriate and doesn&#x27;t need to use sexuality and nudity to be funny
. . . but in today&#x27;s society, I suppose I&#x27;ll be waiting a very long
time.
