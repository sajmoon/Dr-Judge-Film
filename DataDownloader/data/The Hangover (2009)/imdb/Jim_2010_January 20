It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that this movie has a rating of 8 stars,
while I feel that I&#x27;m being extremely generous giving it 6 stars. It
kind of reminds me of when I saw Slumdog Millionaire last year which
was also a movie that was over-hyped until it actually won the best
picture award. That was a complete travesty. This movie, though not
nearly as bad as Slumdog, certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve the praise that
I&#x27;ve been hearing.<br /><br />It won the Golden Globe award a few nights ago for &#x22;Best Motion Picture
- Musical or Comedy&#x22;. Now that I&#x27;ve seen it, that is so hard to
believe. The only other movie that was nominated in that category that
I have watched so far was &#x22;Julie &#x26; Julia&#x22;, which I thought was a better
movie. I&#x27;m sure that after I see the other movies nominated in that
category, there will probably be a couple more that I would rate higher
than &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;. I can&#x27;t say that positively, but I feel pretty
certain that will be the case.<br /><br />This movie, like Slumdog will be forgotten in a few years by most, but
will still unfortunately be in the record books. And all the 10 star
ratings? I think a lot of people saw this movie drunk because they felt
that it was the appropriate thing to do!
