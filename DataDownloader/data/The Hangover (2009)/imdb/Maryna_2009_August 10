I&#x27;ve heard and read a lot of positive reviews about the Hangover. I was
expecting something funny. It was just boring (!). There are a lot of
&#x22;holes&#x22; in the plot. It is too stretched, not plausible at all, even
taking into account that it is a product of someone&#x27;s fantasy. The
movie is full of exaggerated stupidity. Personages are too typical, but
not typical enough to laugh about their behavior. It seemed to me that
scenarists had a creative block with developing the plot and had a hard
time to think out what the personages would do next. The whole movie
looked like a bad parody. It is not even B, it is a C movie. So I warn
you: don&#x27;t expect too much from it. It is not funny. At all. I will
never ever watch it again. Such a waste time.
