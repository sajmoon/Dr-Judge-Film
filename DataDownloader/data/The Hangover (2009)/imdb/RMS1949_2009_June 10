I think my sense of humor is pretty wide based. I loved &#x22;Animal House&#x22;
while I also enjoy subtle less sight-gag humor too. I can laugh at the
Three Stooges and well as appreciate a Woody Allen comic view of life.<br /><br />There was absolutely nothing unique about &#x22;Hangover&#x22;. The whole
bachelor party gone bad has be done before and better, as well as the
whole &#x22;what happens in Vegas stays&#x22; movies.<br /><br />I had about 3 or 4 good laughs but found the movie forgettable and at
times predictable. After trying to be so different, the ending was a
total cop-out and simply done by the numbers. <br /><br />To see this movie in the TOP rated 250 films here is the biggest laugh
this movie actually gave me.
