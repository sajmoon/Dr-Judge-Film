I expect a moronic film like this to poke fun at easy targets, but I
cringed when they tossed off a few casual references to the Holocaust.
Aside from being unfunny, reducing the suffering of countless millions
of people to a punch line amounts to cruelty. It&#x27;s just unacceptable
and has no place here. If these clueless idiots knew anything at all
about history and how fortunate they are to live in a society that
allows them the freedom to act so immature they might behave
differently. But that&#x27;s beside the point of this film, which is to
entertain on the lowest level possible. I found it a rather sad
experience on all counts.
