We&#x27;ve all been there. There have been nights where we&#x27;ve drank too much
and can&#x27;t remember everything. For Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed
Helms), and Alan (Zach Galfianakis), this happens on the bachelor party
for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Unfortunately, the morning
after, they realize that they lost Doug.<br /><br />The humor in &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; comes from the bizarre situations that the
characters find themselves in. Or more specifically, that they got
themselves into the night before, and are just now remembering it. This
type of humor can work, although a film that completely relies on it
(like this one) runs the risk of making the material get dry and tired.
Fortunately, director Todd Philips keeps things brief enough and the
pace quick enough that this doesn&#x27;t really become a problem.<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard to address the acting, because the actors play very familiar
types (this is the film&#x27;s biggest problem). Bradley Cooper is no
stranger to playing a jerk (he got his big break in &#x22;Wedding Crashers,&#x22;
although he&#x27;s more sympathetic here). Ed Helms, while not being a
stranger to comedy, is not a well known name. He&#x27;s the worrywart who
turns into a doormat whenever his over-bearing girlfriend is mentioned.
Zach Galifianakis is the black sheep of the group, who&#x27;s only along
because he&#x27;s going to be Doug&#x27;s brother-in-law. Nevertheless, the
comedy works because all of the principal cast members have a sizable
amount of comic aptitude.<br /><br />Not everything works (the movie feels underdeveloped--with a little
more care, it could have been a masterpiece), but most of it does, and
there are some very big laughs to be found throughout the 100 minute
running time (the end credits alone are worth the price of a few
admission tickets).<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is comedy pure and simple. Nothing is understated, and
it&#x27;s not quirky. It&#x27;s just plain funny.
