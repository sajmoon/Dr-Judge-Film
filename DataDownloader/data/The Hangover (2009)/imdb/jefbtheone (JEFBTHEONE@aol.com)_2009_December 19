From reading the reviews on IMDb and looking at the ratings of many
movies, I now understand why it always seems a bit skewed. It is
because generally the critics look for certain things in a movie, such
as originality, creativity, great plot....but also decency. <br /><br />Tasteless comedies, pointless action movies and gory thrasher flicks
get destroyed by critics. People need to appreciate a movie for what it
is and have an open mind. Face the fact that you cannot be a critic for
all types of movies unless you generally like those types of movies.
I&#x27;m not going to post a rating for GI Joe because I&#x27;m not into military
movies (other than maybe Full Metal Jacket which is in a category of
its own). <br /><br />If you don&#x27;t like dirty, unrealistic, ridiculous rated R comedies then
why are you posting a rating? I would guarantee the same close-minded
people that gave The Hangover a rating under a 6 probably also hated
Knocked Up, Grandma&#x27;s Boy, Porky&#x27;s, and Clerks 2. <br /><br />The Hangover was funny, fun-filled and wild from beginning to end. Zack
Galifanakias is a stand up comedian and is well-respected. If you don&#x27;t
think he&#x27;s funny (for some odd reason) then give your sense a humor a
sanity check. Ed Helms is on The Office. He is also a real comedian and
actually The Office is a funny show (at least most human beings I know
think so). If you don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s funny neither so be it. <br /><br />Okay - so the movie had a similar theme as Dude Where&#x27;s My Car. The
concept behind The Hangover is actually a bit more interesting
considering it involves a bachelor party (if you think bachelor parties
are lame and offensive then I seriously doubt you would like any dirty
rated R comedies), a Vegas stripper, a cardcounter, a baby caught up in
the mix, a mattress on a roof, and Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong and Mike Epps
having a whole lot of fun cracking jokes and whatnot. A combination of
an idiot savant, alpha male and a feeble nerd is actually a lot better
than Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott acting like boneheads. The
comedic brilliance behind this movie runs a lot deeper than some of
these straight-to-the-point, predictable, basic comedies like The
Proposal, What Happens in Vegas, and I Love You Man (which I respect
all 3 of these movies). <br /><br />If you open your mind and truly enjoy a nice, dirty comedy, you might
actually think it&#x27;s funnier than classics like Airplane, Blazing
Saddles, 40 yr Old Virgin, and Clerks. It is up there with the best of
the best. I saw it twice and laughed throughout the whole movie.
