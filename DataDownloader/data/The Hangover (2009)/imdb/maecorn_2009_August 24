A great movie, good comedy, with fun and laughter, with drugs and
dough, with obscenity and perversion, with a light and harmless
storyline. A great mixture of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and some
Guy Richie imitation. Expect no deep emotions, no love line, it&#x27;s a
film to watch with friends and beer.<br /><br />The story is strong with a retrograde mapping of the happenings, but
has nothing new to say, neither has this way of decoding the confusion
some newish style. It is a simply watchable movie, with a &#x27;don&#x27;t expect
a ka-boom at the end&#x27; ending. Once is enough.<br /><br />What really impresses is the cut and rhythm of the movie. It is well
balanced, no real slopes and hills, just evenly tense till the end.<br /><br />There is one scene that had some sort of introducing function, a nice
idea: after drinking J&#xE4;germeister and forgetting the whole
blood-brotherhood crap from Brother Alan, they raise their glasses to
Cheers, than the camera swings on to the Vegas horizon showing the
accelerated dawn behind the skyline. Let&#x27;s the story begin!!! Harmonic
few seconds...<br /><br />The characters, especially Alan are lovable, not to mention here, that
the actors appeared until now in low-budget, somehow neglected films,
which gives some extra taste and virginity to the film and the
evolution of the characters.<br /><br />Summarized up I can only tell You, watch this film, it&#x27;s worth. But
keep in mind this won&#x27;t alter the ways of movie-making in the future.<br /><br />...at least in my opinion. Enjoy!
