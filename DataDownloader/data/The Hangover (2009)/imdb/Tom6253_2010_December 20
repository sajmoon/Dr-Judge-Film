Okay, look. I&#x27;ll admit that it is a little funny, and I am okay with
the stupid, sophomoric humor, after all, that is what makes a lot of
movies great. But COME ON, PEOPLE! A 7.9 rating? 270 million in box
office sales?!!! Let&#x27;s get real here. Not only is this a blatant
rip-off of so many movies, but its the same tired old stupid humor.
More importantly there is a very similar, yet very witty, brilliant
movie out there that has been criminally neglected, while this
mediocre, dime-a-dozen film achieves so much acclaim!! <br /><br />People, do not waste your hard earned money on a movie that the masses
say you should like. Instead check out the movie, Very Bad Things! In
case you don&#x27;t remember it, this little gem came out back in &#x27;98. It is
about a group of guys taking their soon to be married buddy to Vegas
for a bachelor party (much like the Hangover). They have an outrageous
party with booze and drugs and... a hooker. The hooker ends up dead and
the group decides to cover the whole thing up so they can get their
buddy back home to be married and to continue their lives as normal. Of
course things are not that simple, and the cover-up leads to more
death, and the web of lies getting spun even tighter. <br /><br />Christian Slater leads a awesome cast of familiar faces, including
Cameron Diaz, in this hugely under rated black-comedy by director Peter
Berg! If you loved Heathers you&#x27;ll, at the very least, like this movie.
I promise most of you will like it better than the Hangover! Give it a
try. Let me know what you think! This might not be the best comedy
ever, but the offbeat humor, along with good story telling, genuinely
funny characters, and witty dialog, put the Hangover to shame.
