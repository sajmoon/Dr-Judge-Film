Yes,this was a good comedy.I didn&#x27;t expect much from this movie.I must
say that if you liked Old School,Step-Brothers,Wedding
Crashers,SuperBad and other wacked out comedies you will enjoy this
one.<br /><br />I must say that just because of the storyline doesn&#x27;t mean certain
people can&#x27;t enjoy it.So what if the movie is somewhat crude and has
odd things happening in it..that is comedy people and this comedy
cracked me up so hard I actually wanted to see it again after it
finished.<br /><br />This movie had the whole theatre laughing beginning til
end.Seriously,Bradley Cooper was great and so was that other guy who
kind of played the airhead.Actually all the actors were GREAT.<br /><br />I have to say I like this movie for what is: somewhat crude,yet
hilarious. A good storyline and good actors with some good chemistry
make for an awesome movie.<br /><br />Believe if you liked Old School and films like it you should see it.If
you need a good feel &#x22;make you laugh&#x22; type of movie see this.<br /><br />Won&#x27;t disappoint.
