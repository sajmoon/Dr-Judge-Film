This was a very funny movie. I went in with high expectations after all
my friends who saw it this last weekend talked about how it was &#x22;one of
the funniest movies they have ever seen&#x22;. I had seen the trailers and
had wanted to see the movie, but now I was stoked to see it. My
girlfriend and I went to see it because she had also heard it was a
great movie. This movie provided tons of laughs for the both of us. I
would definitely say this is a comedy you can take your girlfriend to,
and if she has any sense of humor, will enjoy herself immensely. The
only bad thing about the movie was that a lot of the funny scenes were
shown in the trailer. I wish I had never seen the movie trailers. There
were also a few scenes that I was saying to myself &#x22;I cant believe they
are showing this in a movie&#x22;, but I left unoffended. Overall, a funny
movie worth seeing. Guys will love this movie, and so will their
girlfriends. 9/10.
