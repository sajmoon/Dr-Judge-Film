I had to admit that I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, I&#x27;m
not a big Todd Phillips fan and Road Trip and Old School were slightly
disappointing to me in the light that I thought they could be way more
dirtier.<br /><br />This movie proved to me that Todd Phillips was holding back for a
reason: This movie contains some of the funniest comedic scenes you
will ever see on-camera. Most notably is Zach Galifianakis, who pretty
much owned every scene in this movie with his awkwardness and witty
dialogue. Another great newcomer is Bradley Cooper from &#x22;Wedding
Crashers&#x22; who did a great job leading the rest of the cast. I&#x27;m pretty
sure that those two have a big career laid out for them after this
movie.<br /><br />The movie contained so many great comedic moments and hilarity that I
found it hard to keep still in theaters, I noticed a few other people
sitting next to me with the same problem.<br /><br />All in all, a great comedy not to be missed, you&#x27;ll love the baby,
you&#x27;ll love the tiger and you&#x27;ll love Mike Tyson. This is a hangover
you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy over and over.<br /><br />8/10
