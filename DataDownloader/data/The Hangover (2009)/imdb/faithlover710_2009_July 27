Okay I never expected to like this movie so much, for once there is a
comedy out there that is actually funny,It keeps you laughing the whole
way through, i work at a movie theater and I suggest this movie to
people every time, people of all ages and the tell me how much they
loved it, no one has told me otherwise, so please see it!!! It is
funny, i promise you that.Out of all the comedies i have seen in my
seventeen years of life,that was by far the funniest for sure. It is a
little gross so I don&#x27;t suggest taking young kids to see it because it
will be a little awkward. well i hope those who haven&#x27;t seen it do
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
