This is a really funny movie. I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to see this but
unfortunately it had to wait until DVD. I chose to watch the newest
Harry Potter movie instead of this. But I think it was a good choice.
Anyway, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I heard so much about this film and
I see why everyone likes this.<br /><br />On the day before Doug&#x27;s wedding day, he and his friends decided to get
drunk and have a party. When they woke up the next morning, Doug was
missing. Now they have to find Doug before the wedding or else they&#x27;re
screwed.<br /><br />There are many hilarious jokes in here. My favorite scenes involved the
tiger and the baby. I just loved the baby scene. I really can&#x27;t wait to
see Hangover 2. I rate this film 9/10.
