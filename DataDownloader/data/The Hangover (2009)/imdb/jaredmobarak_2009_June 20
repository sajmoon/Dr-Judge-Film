2009_June 20 
The success of Old School pretty much vaulted Todd Phillips onto the
A-list for comedy directors. We waited and waited for his second hit,
but only got the mediocre Starsky and Hutch and, what I can only
imagine as disappointing, School for Scoundrels. The Hangover lives up
to the exorbitant amount of praise being tossed around everywhere; the
buzz is running rampant online and rumors of a sequel have already
started months before the film is even released. Movies pertaining to
the alcohol induced shenanigans that can occur at a bachelor party two
days before the wedding&#x97;in Vegas no less&#x97;always bring something funny
to the table. The Hangover, however, trumps them all on sheer
absurdity, craziness, and all-around hilarity.<br /><br />Doug is about to marry the girl of his dreams, a woman with wealth, but
also a family that seems grounded in reality. It is a couple days
before the nuptials and Doug is on his way to Vegas for a night of fun
with his two best friends and soon-to-be brother-in-law. This foursome
is such a mixed bag that you believe them to all be real friends. Doug
is the successful, who knows what, (we sadly learn very little about
his character as he is a mere pawn for the evening to occur); Phil is
the married teacher that hates his life, marriage, and children in
general; and Stu is the nerdy doctor&#x97;sorry, dentist&#x97;without a backbone,
but who you know can be wild when a few drinks have been imbibed. As
for Alan, the bride-to-be&#x27;s brother, he is the wild card of the bunch.
Only having met Phil and Stu a few times and a bit off in the head&#x97;he
is not a &#x22;rah-tard&#x22; though&#x97;you never know how he may interact with the
others, nor what he may do or say about his wolfpack brothers.<br /><br />The evening starts with the four going to the hotel&#x27;s roof to take a
shot of Jager and toast the groom on one last night of partying. It is
right after this exchange that Phillips brings us to the next morning:
Stu minus a tooth, Alan without pants and in the company of a tiger,
and Phil with no recollection that he was in the hospital sometime
during the night. Well, I don&#x27;t want to knock Phil too much; no one
remembers anything of what happened, nor can they find Doug. In fact,
rather than their friend, they find a baby crying in the closet. Amidst
the strewn-about debris, smoking chair, and random chicken, the boys
realize that they have less than 48 hours to find the groom and get him
to his wedding. The adventure that commences takes them on a journey
through the many locations they visited the night before, compiling a
timeline while allowing the audience to enjoy the laughs that come with
the evidence of what happened and the reactions to it all from the
threesome. Throw in a newly married stripper; a gay Asian with
crimeworld pull, angry and naked from being trapped in the trunk of a
car; a kidnapping; a stolen police car; and yes, Mike Tyson singing
Phil Collins, and you can only imagine the uproarious laughter that
will be emitting from your body.<br /><br />But it is Galifianakis who surprises the most and completely shines as
the off-kilter Alan. I&#x27;ll admit to mostly being turned off by his brand
of humor, generally jokes that run on too long and are too dry for
their own good, (although he is the best thing in Out Cold). Here,
however, it all works beautifully. Even when he risks going too far,
like with his wolfpack speech at the beginning, Phillips seems to have
been able to cut him to the perfect length in order to maintain the
joke and not destroy it. He is a little child&#x97;&#x22;don&#x27;t let the beard fool
you&#x22;&#x97;and his innocence and ambivalence to what is going on around him
is priceless. His emotions get the better of him, he wants nothing more
than to be Cooper&#x27;s best friend or carbon copy, his delivery of absurd
lines is so straight-faced you become as dumbfounded as Stu and Phil,
and his props add even more to the character. His satchel, his
Blackjack book, and his roofies, among other things, enhance the jokes
and the plot. A moment with him and Cooper mimicking Rain Man brings
the laughs as does a slo-mo sequence between he and a little boy on a
field trip to a police station. When Galifianakis is on screen, you
truly have no idea what will happen next.<br /><br />I know I have spoken little about the plot, but really, besides
pertaining to three guys trying to remember what happened to them the
night before, and where their best friend went, there isn&#x27;t much else
to say. The Hangover could have easily fallen prey to the &#x22;SNL&#x22;
syndrome of just being skit after skit, loosely connected into a story,
yet too disjointed to really enjoy, but the cast and crew never let
this happen. Bringing in actors like Heather Graham, Rachael Harris,
and a scene-stealing performance from Ken Jeong only expand the story
rather than derail it. The jokes come so quick and successfully that
you have little time to question what is happening, and you are
laughing so hard that you are probably missing dialogue anyways. And
don&#x27;t even get me started on Mike Tyson&#x27;s lisp; he deserves a high-five
for sure. The only thing I can say is that you will laugh, because,
honestly, who wouldn&#x27;t enjoy watching a night of excess that went so
overboard it&#x27;s participants can only recall what happened through the
X-rated photos on their digital camera? Yes, you do get to see those
gems in all their glory during the end credits.
