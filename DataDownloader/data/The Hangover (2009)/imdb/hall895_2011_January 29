The Hangover is one of those movies which doesn&#x27;t live up to the
standards suggested by all the breathless hype. It&#x27;s rather overrated,
most definitely not one of the funniest movies ever made as so many of
its ardent fans would suggest it to be. It&#x27;s an OK movie, no more, no
less. It has a smart, interesting setup but the setup proves to be
better than the execution. You get the sense a lot of truly hilarious
things happened over the time frame of the story. But we never actually
see those things. We missed the debauchery and saw only the aftermath.
It was an interesting premise, having the characters try to piece
together what happened during the night of madness they can&#x27;t remember.
But it feels like we missed the good stuff. And what we&#x27;re left with
isn&#x27;t enough to compensate. It&#x27;s a movie which has its moments but what
should have been the best moments are pretty clearly the moments we
never see.<br /><br />The story surrounds a wild, crazy bachelor party. Doug is the groom,
his wedding a mere two days away when he, his two best friends and his
bride-to-be&#x27;s rather strange brother head to Vegas. Note to future
grooms: going to Vegas two days before your wedding...bad idea. The
movie opens on the morning of the wedding with one of the friends
calling the bride to deliver the bad news. They can&#x27;t find Doug. Flash
back a couple of days and we see the gang of four preparing for their
excursion. We see the drive from California to Vegas, their arrival in
Sin City and a toast to a night they&#x27;ll never forget. And then it&#x27;s the
next morning. And all hell has broken loose. And Doug is gone. And none
of the other three can remember a thing. And there&#x27;s a tiger in the
bathroom.<br /><br />There&#x27;s the tiger. And a chicken, a police car and a mattress impaled
on a statue. There&#x27;s a baby. And a stripper, a naked Asian man and a
former heavyweight champion of the world. How do all these things tie
together? What the heck happened last night? And where is Doug? Our
gang, now down to three, begins a seemingly futile attempt to make
sense of the madness. As they try to piece together the puzzle we&#x27;re
treated to some laughs. But not nearly as many laughs as this movie&#x27;s
reputation would suggest. The movie just is not consistently funny
enough, it&#x27;s very hit and miss. And while the setup sounds like it
makes room for all kinds of outrageous stuff the movie actually ends up
being much more tame than you would think. The fact that the three main
characters are as a group rather bland doesn&#x27;t help. The characters of
Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively, are
pretty much straight men, there to play off the really funny
characters. And that&#x27;s where the bride&#x27;s brother Alan, played by Zach
Galifianakis, comes in. He&#x27;s clearly meant to be the most memorable
character, the wacky, strange, outlandish funnyman. But while he&#x27;s
clearly funnier than the other two the character doesn&#x27;t make as much
of an impression as he really needs to for the movie to be as riotously
funny as it promised to be. Supporting players, on the screen for only
a few minutes here and there, really outshine the three central
characters. And that&#x27;s a problem. The Hangover is the story of one wild
night. But it&#x27;s one wild night which the audience missed out on. Much
of the funniest stuff the film has to offer doesn&#x27;t come until the
closing credits have begun to roll. And by then it&#x27;s much too late. Not
a bad movie. But one which has a reputation which far exceeds its
actual quality.
