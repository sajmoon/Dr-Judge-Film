Todd Phillips (Director) has done a good job with &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; just
as he has in a previous movie &#x22;Old School&#x22;. Phillips previous movie
pertaining to &#x22;Old School&#x22; is filled with good actors/actress,
dialogue, and comedy. Both of Phillips movies &#x22;Old School&#x22; and &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22; are full with comedy and action that will have tears coming
out and on your knees. Phillips along with writers Jon Lucas and Scott
Moore have set out to do what they planned to delivery. Throughout this
movie you will see the different in low-key lighting/high-key lighting,
motifs, and angles (low/high) and the music as scenes are being
transiting. The Hangover was filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Doug Billing
is about to marry one of his friend&#x27;s Alan Garner sister Tracy Garner
in two days. Doug and Alan along with two of their other buddies, Phil
Wenneck and Stu Price are off to Las Vegas for a couple of days for
some male bonding. Phil, a high school teacher and married, tends to
acts childish when with his pals. Stu, a dentist has a girlfriend by
the name of Melissa. She&#x27;s very controlling and is very much against
Stu going on this male bonding trip. One day he hopes to eventually
marry Melissa. However, Alan seems to be on another level with the
social graces of the western world. The next day after arriving in Las
Vegas, they all wake up with the worst &#x22;Hangover&#x22;. The suite is in
stumbles and things are where they shouldn&#x27;t be and missing. They can&#x27;t
remember anything that happens within the last 12 plus hours. One
element for sure is that Doug is missing. Therefore, they are running
out of time before they are due to be back in Los Angeles. If not back
than they will have to do some explaining to Tracy what they haven&#x27;t
returned. In one scene you will see where all four of them are on the
roof top in Las Vegas toasting to Doug last night as a single man. The
scene is relevant to the theme because it takes place in Vegas and the
scenery is great. Just imaging the lighting along with the setting it&#x27;s
great. The other technique that was used in this movie, angles. The
scene was when Phil and Stu were outside looking in the truck of the
car and there goes that great shot of the sky and Mandalay Bay hotel.
It&#x27;s funny to watch men to exploit their insecurities. The Hangover was
a smash for 2009. I hope to see more of Doug, Alan, Phil and Stu in
upcoming movies because they were great. Phillips when will we see &#x22;The
Hangover II&#x22;?
