The Hangover is perhaps the funniest movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I would
gladly see it again, and again.<br /><br />The film begins as the main cast is sitting in the Mojave Desert. One
of the main characters, Phil (Bradley Cooper), calls a bride. He
informs her that they screwed up, big time. He tells her that the
wedding isn&#x27;t going to happen because they have lost the groom. The
movie then flashes back in time two days as a group of friends are
preparing for a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The group includes
schoolteacher Phil, dentist Stu (Ed Helms), the groom Doug (Justin
Bartha) and Doug&#x27;s future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis), an
eccentric and slightly crazy guy with a round belly and Jesus beard.<br /><br />The group goes onto the roof of Caesar&#x27;s Palace for drinks, and then
wake up the next morning without remembering a thing. I was both glad
and upset to not see a party scene, however, the way the movie does it
fits perfectly. Anyway, they wake up the next morning with their $4,200
suite trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby, a chicken and a
missing tooth. The gang&#x27;s search for what happened the night before
provides content for the rest of the film.<br /><br />The group then realize that Doug, their best friend, is missing. They
set out to find him in Sin City, where anything is possible. The search
takes them to a Wedding Chapel, a Police Station, a stripper&#x27;s
apartment and Mike Tyson&#x27;s estate. The entire journey is fueled with
laughs which never stop.<br /><br />This movie is directed by Todd Philips (Old School &#x26; Road Trip), this
is by far his best film. The cast, with no huge stars still worked
incredibly well together and created an unstoppable team of comedy.
Although Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Ken Jeong, with the small role of
Mr. Chow, were all funny, nothing prepared me for Zach Galifianakis.
Before The Hangover, Galifianakis was virtually unheard of. This film
was a make or break movie for him, and I say he scored perfectly. His
character, Alan, is lovable but incredibly dumb-witted and is hard to
hate. Overall, this is the comedy event of the year, maybe even the
century.
