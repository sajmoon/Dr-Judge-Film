First time i skipped this movie. But one of my friend said to watch
this. And thanks to him i watched this and if i miss this, i think it
is a real miss in the point of view of a comedy movie.<br /><br />Most interesting part is tiger scene in Mike Tyson&#x27;s house. I would say
this is the best ever comedy movie i have ever watched. It is a real
comedy movie with a nice story. The only part they missed is they have
forgotten to solve how the chicken came to hotel room. And also this
movie is strengthen by without much involvement of actress&#x27;s acting. <br /><br />Zach Galifianakis, super acting. I haven&#x27;t seen him any other movies
earlier. And also Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms, superb acting. Love to
watch this again and again.<br /><br />Waiting to watch part 2.
