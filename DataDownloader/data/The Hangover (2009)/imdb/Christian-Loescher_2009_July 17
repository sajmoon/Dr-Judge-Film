The Hangover is a compelling anomaly of a comedy, one that easily could
have been just another movie where a group of thirtysomething dudes get
drunk and into all sorts of trouble. The method in which its story is
told, however, sets it apart from its comedic kin and makes it all the
more hilarious and brilliant.<br /><br />A small group of friends, pretty boy Phil (Bradley Cooper),
lady-whipped Stu (The Office&#x27;s &#x22;Andy,&#x22; Ed Helms), socially inept Alan
(awesome newcomer Zach Galifianakis), and groom-to-be Doug (Justin
Bartha), decide to go to Las Vegas for a final free-roaming,
binge-drinking evening away from their normal lives, two days before
Doug&#x27;s nuptials are set to take place. Predictably, the drinking begins
early upon their arrival, and not surprisingly, the antics begin. The
best departure about The Hangover, however, is the intelligent
structure of the story from there on out. The bachelors awake the next
morning to discover that not only do they not remember a single thing
from the night before, but also that their man of the hour, Doug, is
missing and nowhere to be found. It turns out that, for reasons the
film so elegantly reveals, that the men had been drugged. Their hotel
room is in shambles, a baby is found in the closet, and a tiger has set
up shop in the bathroom. The three friends are in similarly puzzling
positions: Phil finds a hospital bracelet around his wrist, Stu is
missing a front tooth, and Alan yet again finds it difficult to locate
a pair of pants.<br /><br />From that point, as the viewer, you&#x27;re taken on a journey throughout
Vegas with the film&#x27;s three main antagonists, to determine what
happened to them and their ride home, Doug. You find out just as much
as the three friends do, and at the exact same time, about their night
out, which drives up the anticipation of whatever following humorous
event the friends discover. The interaction and comedic chemistry
between Phil, Stu, and Alan is amazing; the casting couldn&#x27;t have been
done any better. The Hangover also contains cameo appearances from
several unexpected characters, including Mike Tyson and several actors
who starred in 2003&#x27;s Old School (one of director Todd Phillips&#x27;s
fantastic previous works). The dialogue and language is crude and
offensive, yet appropriate and rip-roaringly funny, and there&#x27;s even
bits of karmic plot points that round out the movie as an extremely
well-accomplished work of raucous, constant humor.<br /><br />Up until this point, Old School only had a small handful of competitive
equals, but The Hangover is so confidently funny that it eclipses many
of said competitors with ease. Even if somehow you don&#x27;t begin to enjoy
the movie from its opening moments, you&#x27;ll be unable to stop being
washed into the swirling miasma of curiosity and humor that The
Hangover possesses. Chock-full of one-liners and hilarious moments, The
Hangover is a treat, and unlike hangovers we&#x27;ve all had, will be one
you&#x27;ll be more than pleased to undertake a second time.
