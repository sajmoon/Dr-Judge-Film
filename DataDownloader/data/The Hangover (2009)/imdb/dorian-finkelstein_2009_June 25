This is the funniest film I have ever seen genuinely, I cannot remember
laughing so so much while watching a movie. OK most comedies advertise
themselves as the funniest film ever but this can definitely take that
title, I don&#x27;t really go to the cinema very often because no movies
have really taken my fancy that much and I also have a busy family life
so I entered the theater expecting a few funny moments in the movie but
once they started coming they didn&#x27;t stop. I also didn&#x27;t know who any
of the actors were, a couple of them I recognized but in general didn&#x27;t
&#x22;know&#x22; them, OK the film would suit anyone with a sense of humor but
would bring out the sense of humor in someone who does not normally
show it I will be buying this on DVD as soon as it is out got to be
seen to be believed.
