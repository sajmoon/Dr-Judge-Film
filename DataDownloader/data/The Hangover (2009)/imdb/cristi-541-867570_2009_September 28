Thanks to the IMDb rating, I spent 1.5 hours of my life watching this
great comedy. I recommend it to anyone eager to have quality fun. It
really is a masterpiece of the American movie factory. I find that any
other successful comedy movies are paling in comparison to this state
of the art movie. It truly reveals some very talented actors and one
very clever director, their skills in transmitting emotions to the
public are unique, really a very nice example of the power of the
American movie school. Let&#x27;s not forget about the script which is
delicious, it made me roll on the floor laughing ...I didn&#x27;t have such
a good laughing in ages.
