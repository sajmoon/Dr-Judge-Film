The Hangover takes place in Las Vegas when Doug Billings, played by
Justin Bartha, and Tracy Garner, played by Sasha Barrese, are two days
away from being married. Doug&#x27;s friends, Phil Wenneck, played by
Bradley Cooper, Stu Price, played by Ed Helms, and Alan Garner, played
by Zach Galifianakis, thought that now is the time for a bachelor party
and where else better to party then Vegas. To their misfortune, after a
long night of hard partying and great times, they wake up to the worst
hangover ever, find the groom missing, and at the same time have no
recollection of what happened the night before. It is now up to the
three of them to find Doug before his wedding just a day away. With no
time to waste they begin to look for clues to help steer them towards
the right direction to find Doug and in doing so find out piece by
piece the crazy night that none of them could ever imagine.<br /><br />I believe &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was one of the funniest movies I have seen
since &#x22;Superbad&#x22;, &#x22;Step Brothers&#x22;, and &#x22;Pineapple Express&#x22;. I laughed
from beginning to end. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a must watch in theaters. The
character of Alan Garner is comical in the film. He brought a unique
character to life with his funny scenes. Bradley Cooper, in the movie,
is a teacher that would be awesome to have in real life. His character
is what gets the group to be so much fun, by making them do all the
crazy stuff with his frat boy like attitude. This movie is
unquestionably one of the best comedy films of the year and a must see.<br /><br />Director Todd Phillips has a unique perspective of the film. He likes
the way the characters portray their bad behavior and feels that this
is what makes a film so funny. He doesn&#x27;t really have a moral or point
to the film except to make it funny and something that everyone can
enjoy and have a good laugh. The director portrays the characters funny
characteristics through their great personalities and funny punch
lines. I feel he does an excellent job directing and keeping the film
funny throughout the entire movie.
