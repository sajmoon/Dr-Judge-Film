The Hangover is a very good comedy movie. I spent almost all the movie
time laughing. This one will make you laugh till you fall on your back.
I can rate it one of the best comedy movies in history. . A group of
friends meets many situations in which they act, think and talk some
comedy. I didn&#x27;t laugh this much a long time ago. I loved every second
of the movie. and I&#x27;m ready to watch it again and again and again and
I&#x27;m sure I will not be bored. All the four characters are amazing in
this film. They played their roles very professionally. So, if you want
a good comedy movie, this is the one you are looking for. As I can see
(in the moment I wrote this review) it has a rating of 7.9 and I&#x27;m sure
it deserves more than that. I rated it 10 stars as I love comedy movies
especially good ones like this.
