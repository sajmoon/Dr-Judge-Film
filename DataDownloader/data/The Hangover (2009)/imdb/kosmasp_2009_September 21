When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it&#x27;s funniest
moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which
does have some similarities to the movie &#x22;Very Bad Things&#x22;, but does
not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons
and was therefor successful.<br /><br />The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active)
role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he
can display his comedic potential more than in &#x22;He&#x27;s not that into
you&#x22;. Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off,
but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I&#x27;ve seen in
several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a
cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can
avoid it, don&#x27;t watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo
in particular is just so much better, if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s gonna
hit you ... again no pun intended).<br /><br />The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a
bit, but it&#x27;s all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is
just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don&#x27;t know what
they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I&#x27;d love to see
one! :o)
