I decided to go to this movie with some classmates after our last test
before summer vacation. The girls had some mixed feelings, they thought
it was gonna be a black comedy with humour only men can relate to. They
were wrong, since the movie begin both girls and guys where laughing
24/7. It&#x27;s a fast and really entertaining movie! I went with a group of
completely different kind of people, they all LOVED it.<br /><br />Not only we had a laugh we where sucked into the movie as well, it kept
us on the edge of our seat the entire time. The story line is
incredible creative and builds up tension really good.<br /><br />You will love it so go see it!!
