The worst comedy I&#x27;ve seen in the last year. The talented cast is
wasted (especially Heather Graham) on this unoriginal script filled
with shallow stereotypes. Bradley Cooper struts through the movie as a
completely unlikable good-looking jerk who has no problems cheating on
his wife and ignoring his son while in Vegas. The other actors are
mostly forgettable and poor Heather Graham is wasted in her cameo role.
How this ever got nominated for a golden globe and how it won is
obviously a bit of a back room bargain and payoff with Hollywood
Foreign Press, because the film is not funny. I only laughed once
during the whole thing and that was the tiger in the car scene. Its sad
when Mike Tyson&#x27;s tiger is funnier then the entire rest of the cast.
I&#x27;m glad I did not waste 10.00 bucks seeing this at the show, this is a
rental and no more. This makes Porky&#x27;s and Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s 2 look
like The Godfather, don&#x27;t waste your time.
