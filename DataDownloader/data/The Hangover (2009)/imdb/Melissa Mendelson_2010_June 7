2010_June 7 
An unforgettable night disappears in a blink of an eye. Fragments of
moments lost cascade into a spiral of chaos, and a trail of faint
breadcrumbs leads into dangerous territory. But one remains missing,
and time is running out. And if pieces of the puzzle don&#x27;t add up soon,
all will be lost, and promise of love will be broken. Lives twist and
turn along the tightrope of comedy, lingering with suspense, and
pulsing with pure drama, and we are riveted, held captive to the
dilemma of three men in desperate search of their friend. And as they
struggle to find the one that remains out of reach, they pull us into a
wild, insane adventure that leaves us in stitches and with tears still
in our eyes. And their wild night of Vegas is a memory to always be
cherished.
