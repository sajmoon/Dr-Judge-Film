This film was amazing, from start to finish I was laughing all the way
through. My mom was even laughing, and she doesn&#x27;t even like crude
humor, but she said she wanted to see something funny for her birthday.
And she even said it was the funniest movie shes ever seen.<br /><br />The cast is amazing, and the writing was great as well. It balances out
the humor quite well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to make fun of one general thing
to much (Race,Gender,Homosexuality). The movie always seems to surprise
you, and it is nearly impossible to guess what happens next which is a
big plus for me.<br /><br />My one complaint about the movie is that near the end it kind of felt
pushed, I would say the last 20 Min, but its all made up for with a
great ending, and a few pictures from the wild night during the
credits.<br /><br />The movie is pretty vulgar I&#x27;m not going to lie, but some of the
situations that they are put into are just so funny you can&#x27;t help but
laugh, I remember at one point I was literally in tears, not just
watery eyes, tears.<br /><br />If you want to laugh, a lot, See this movie.
