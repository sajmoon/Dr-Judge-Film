Not because I agree with them, not at all, I loved the movie. I laughed
so much throughout this movie, it was great. But there are those who
hate this movie, and they all say the same thing &#x27;Is it just me? All my
friends seem to think it&#x27;s hilarious but I barely even let out a
snicker during the entire thing.&#x27; You can easily examine this and
determine why these people think that this isn&#x27;t funny. These people
are annoying, egotistical asses who think they&#x27;re god&#x27;s gift to the
world. The first line, which they ALL use, &#x27;Is it just me?&#x27; shows how
they try to identify themselves as unique and &#x27;above&#x27; everyone who
likes this movie. Yup, they think that they are superior people because
of which movies they like. They then use the &#x27;all my friends&#x27; line,
which is laughable because these are the types of people without any
friends. Then they say &#x27;I barely let out a snicker&#x27;, implying that the
movie wasn&#x27;t just bad overall, they try to make it seem as though there
was no part of the movie, even for say, 5 seconds, that was funny
enough to make them laugh. So, to the people who say they hate this
movie: No one cares about what you think you self-centred moron. I hate
these kinds of people, luckily I haven&#x27;t known too many of them in my
time. They also usually think that they are exceptionally intelligent,
but their life situation, which of course matches their actual
intelligence, is completely average and they blame it on something that
they of course have no control over. Anyway, enough with those ass
holes, this movie was awesome. If you are one of the people I described
above with a ten-foot pole up your ass, then watch the movie. You&#x27;ll
control yourself and won&#x27;t laugh at all to try to seem too high-brow
for this movie, but secretly you&#x27;ll love it and you&#x27;ll hate that you
love it because you need to seem intelligent because you know that you
need to seem intelligent whenever possible because in reality, you
aren&#x27;t... at all. If you aren&#x27;t one of the people I described above,
then WATCH THIS MOVIE, you WILL laugh a lot during this movie, I
certainly did.
