I&#x27;ve seen a trailer for this movie when i went to see a Terminator 4
and i instantly liked it.However i still had a doubt that this movie
will turn out to be something like &#x27;What happens in Vegas&#x27; with Ashton
Kutcher and Cameron Diaz which is not a bad comedy but nothing special
either,just an average movie.I must say that i&#x27;m glad that my doubt&#x27;s
did not come true.The Hangover is a great comedy.One of the best.It&#x27;s
as funny as it could be.It&#x27;s even intelligent in some sort of weird
way.<br /><br />Tod Phillip&#x27;s has chosen a dream cast for this film.The cast is really
excellent.And not only because the characters are great.<br /><br />Writing is excellent too.They&#x27;ve managed to write a comedy that at no
point is a clich&#xE9; and that at no point is predictable which is a great
plus in my book.The only man who managed to do that in this genre in
the last couple of year&#x27;s is Judd Apatow.<br /><br />Too short the story this movie is great.A weird and perverse fat man,a
fancy guy,a geek and a missing bachelor will make you laugh from
beginning until the end.Go and see this movie!You wont regret it!!!
