More than once in my life, I have been accused of lacking a sense of
humor, and lately I&#x27;ve been wondering if that&#x27;s really the case, or if
American comedy has become a sad case of settling for less (and just
praising it more). I still don&#x27;t get the fascination with Sacha Baron
Cohen&#x27;s outrageous publicity stunts masquerading as &#x22;films&#x22;; nor do I
manage many laughs at the efforts of box-office juggernaut Judd Apatow.
My decision to see &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; was influenced by two factors: the
praise some casual acquaintances had given it; and a genuine lack of
anything else interesting playing. With a Sunday-afternoon audience of
probably 30 people, I found that the American comedic film--not to
mention my sense of humor--was more than alive and well. Directed by
Todd Phillips (&#x22;Road Trip&#x22;), &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is the tale of four
friends: cocky elementary-school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper); meek,
whipped dentist Stu (&#x22;Daily Show&#x22; correspondent Ed Helms); WASPy
groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha); and his mentally deficient future
brother-in-law, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), who trek to Las Vegas for
Doug&#x27;s bachelor party the night before he&#x27;s set to tie the knot. After
a rooftop Jagermeister toast that commences the night&#x27;s activities, we
flash forward to the next morning, with the friends&#x27; hotel suite in
disarray (including a tiger holed up in the bathroom), and Doug nowhere
to be found; while trying to remember what happened the night before,
our trio of suddenly sober man-children embark on a quest that is as
hilarious as it is unpredictable. Instead of a straightforward
narrative where all the comedic beats are telegraphed in advance (such
is the fate of most films of this sort; and the story is admittedly
nothing new), John Lucas&#x27; and Scott Moore&#x27;s screenplay mines the sort
of surprise and revelation that marks a good mystery thriller (which
the film could have easily been played for), transforming each
punchline into an uproarious zinger as a result. One of the best films
I&#x27;ve seen this year, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is also the funniest Hollywood
comedy in ages.
