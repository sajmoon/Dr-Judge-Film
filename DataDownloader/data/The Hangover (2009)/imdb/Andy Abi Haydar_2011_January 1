The movie talks about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes
missing in the middle of Las Vegas.<br /><br />The characters are different and you can relate to each one. You have
the responsible yet loose Doug, the adventurous Phil, the &#x27;adult&#x27; Stu,
and the sick-o Alan.<br /><br />The movie has its moments, it&#x27;s funny at times but gets a little lame
when it&#x27;s the same joke over and over again. The ending was kind of
shocking since it was sudden and out of the blue the way they found
Doug.<br /><br />However, it was fun. I enjoyed it and I will certainly be watching it
again since it doesn&#x27;t get old. You should watch it too if you haven&#x27;t,
and if you did, watch it again. Why not anyway?
