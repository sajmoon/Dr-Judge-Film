Great movie about 4 guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party, they wake
up the next morning missing a friend who is going to marry very soon.
They are going to look for him. This will not go so simply because they
have forgotten everything, so they try to remember by going to all the
places en people they have seen the night before. I just saw it about 6
hours ago, in Almere(The Netherlands). It&#x27;s very hilarious, with some
very (and when I say very I mean VERY, VERY) random things in it. Some
jokes are predictable, but that is not annoying, sometimes it even
makes it better. This is a great movie for all guys out there, and for
some even recognizable.
