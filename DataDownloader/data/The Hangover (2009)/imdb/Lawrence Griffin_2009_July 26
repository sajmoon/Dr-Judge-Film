2009_July 26 
Hell, another good 2009 movie. For all my grievances about not being
able to see Up, Moon and The Brothers Bloom all in one week, it seems
like all of it is finally paying off, as I found this movie very
entertaining.<br /><br />The comedy is hit and miss, but to be fair, it&#x27;s mostly hit, with my
only real criticism being that the characters are kind of stock - but
then again, they&#x27;re still enjoyable and really fun to watch, and
surprisingly developed and well written in the end, too. The dialogue
is good and the first forty five minutes or so are really good, with
the random suspense mixture throwing you for loop after loop until the
conclusion. The comedy, when it&#x27;s really &#x22;on,&#x22; is delightfully vulgar
and silly, and the pace of the movie is great, sending you on a wild
adventure that you won&#x27;t forget any time soon, full of laughs.<br /><br />The ending seems to drag on a bit, but again, nothing that really hurts
the movie. The Hangover isn&#x27;t a modern classic, but it&#x27;s definitely a
good movie, and it kept me interested. Recommended. I really did like
what they did with the ending credits, that was just great. Set this
movie apart from others; and it didn&#x27;t even make you wait until the
ages of credits were done to see anything extra.
