&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is boorish. Vulgar. Brash. Crude. Offensive. Twisted.
Politically incorrect. And it is unexpectedly and, often,
side-splittingly funny, and one of the best comedies to come out of
Hollywood in a long time.<br /><br />Here&#x27;s the thing about Todd Phillips&#x27; movie: It has no pretensions
about what it is. Phillips&#x27; directorial credits include &#x22;Road Trip&#x22;
(2000), &#x22;Old School&#x22; (2003), &#x22;Starsky &#x26; Hutch&#x22; (2004) and &#x22;School For
Scoundrels&#x22; (2006). But this is clearly his best and most consistently
funny movie.<br /><br />Who gets the credit for this film working? Phillips or screenwriters
Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who, let&#x27;s face it, didn&#x27;t exactly hit home
runs with &#x22;Four Christmases&#x22; (2008) or &#x22;Ghost of Girlfriends Past&#x22;
(2009)? What are the chances they happened to strike gold with this
one? And much has been written about how Phillips rewrote the script
for &#x22;The Hangover.&#x22; How much of that is apocryphal is unknown.<br /><br />What makes &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; work - other than a welcome change of not
seeing Will Ferrell - is the cast of &#x22;relative unknowns.&#x22; We&#x27;ve seen
them in movies before, but they tend to fall more into the category of
&#x22;that guy&#x22; than anything else. It&#x27;s unlikely they remain unknown, given
how hugely successful this film is.<br /><br />But no one in this cast - at least among the main leads - is hamming
for the camera or acting as if they know what they are doing is funny.
The trick here is that Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis
play much of it dead pan, taking the situation they find themselves in
very seriously. There is a reason why we find Frank Drebin of &#x22;The
Naked Gun&#x22; films so funny: Because Leslie Nielsen plays all his lines
straight.<br /><br />That&#x27;s exactly what Cooper, Helms and Galiafianakis do. (Compare what
they do to what Ferrell did in, say, &#x22;Old School,&#x22; and you&#x27;ll see what
I mean.) Just watch how Galifianakis treats a line about the Holocaust
or what condiments Tigers like. They are both good lines, but what
makes them very funny is that he says them so matter-of-factly.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Galifianakis for years. His stand-up routines are
awfully funny and, most recently, I have discovered his &#x22;Between Two
Ferns&#x22; online talk show that is funnier in two minutes than most
30-minute TV sitcoms. (If you haven&#x27;t seen &#x22;Between Two Ferns,&#x22; do
yourself a favor and seek it out online.) In fact, that show is a fine
example of how to do comedy well. Talk about playing it straight!<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; should rightfully make Galifianakis a sought-out figure,
as popular as Seth Rogen, except he&#x27;s a better actor and more tolerable
than Rogen. Galifianakis deserves all the success this film should
bring him. He brings a certain naivet&#xE9; to his role of Alan Garner, the
bride&#x27;s brother. He isn&#x27;t shy, but there&#x27;s a sweet charm to him that
makes him awfully endearing.<br /><br />When &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; stumbles, it is because supporting actors Ken Jeong
and Rob Riggle play their roles for laughs, over-acting and trying too
hard to sell their jokes. The story bogs down when it gets too wrapped
up in exposition: A needless sequence involving Jeong&#x27;s Mr. Chow. Too
bad, because his introduction is absolutely hysterical and the
writer(s) could have included the expositionary stuff right there when
we first meet Mr. Chow. The bit with Riggle seems unnecessary and too
forced. His shtick works in sketches on &#x22;The Daily Show With Jon
Stewart,&#x22; but, here, it falls flat.<br /><br />Frankly, I was (pleasantly) surprised that I so enjoyed &#x22;The Hangover.&#x22;
The concept of bachelors heading off to Vegas for a bachelor party
replete with strippers is so tired that I thoroughly expected another
routine boys-will-be-boys movie. But Phillips wisely never shows us the
revelry the boys got into. Instead, what we see is the aftermath as the
guys try to reconstruct the previous night&#x27;s events.<br /><br />Much is left to our imagination as the guys try to solve a mystery.
They find clues, some more enticing than the other, some more
revelatory than the others. Along the way, they meet a physician, Mike
Tyson and a hooker (Heather Graham), who is more than a mere hooker
with a good heart - she wants to meet Mr. Right. It&#x27;s lovely to see
Graham in a movie like this, though she isn&#x27;t given much to do. She
deserves to be in a hit film, considering some of the junk she has done
for the past few years. Truly, clunkers, such as &#x22;Cake&#x22; (2005), &#x22;Gray
Matters&#x22; (2006) and &#x22;Miss Conception&#x22; (2008), do not do this woman
justice. Give her good material and she shines. Her too-brief
appearance on the TV show, &#x22;Scrubs,&#x22; proves that. I hope she shows up
more in &#x22;The Hangover 2.&#x22;<br /><br />The humor is often rude, coarse and can be offensive. But the thing
about Phillips&#x27; movie is the humor - visual and verbal - is grounded in
character. We care about Alan, Stu and Phil and what happens to them as
they try to find their buddy, Doug. We root for them, because, despite
their boorishness, their characters have heart.<br /><br />&#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is funny from the very beginning. It stumbles
occasionally, especially in the third act, when some of the lesser
characters try too hard. But those are forgivable sins, considering how
hilarious the rest of the movie is.<br /><br />However, if you are one of those people who frowns at low-brow humor -
and some of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; stoops low - or is easily offended by myriad
foul jokes, then might I suggest you skip this film and go see, say,
&#x22;My Life in Ruins,&#x22; a wholly insipid movie brimming with thoroughly
inoffensive milquetoast characters?<br /><br />But if you enjoy genuinely funny movies that earn their R rating
because they go for broke with their jokes, then I heartily recommend
&#x22;The Hangover.&#x22; I might be hard-pressed to see a funnier film this
year.
