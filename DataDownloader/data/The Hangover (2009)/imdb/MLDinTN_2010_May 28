I was expecting to laugh a lot since this movie got such good reviews
in the theater, but I didn&#x27;t laugh once. It was OK, but I didn&#x27;t find
it funny. The film is about 4 guys going to Vegas a couple of days
before one of them, Doug, is about to get married. One of them, Alan,
buys some drugs and puts it in their drinks. It turns out to be
roophies, so the foursome don&#x27;t remember what happened in the morning.
They wake up and soon to be groom, Doug, is missing. So, the other 3
try to track down what they did the previous night. It involves a baby,
stripper, tiger, Chinese dude looking for his money, and Mike Tyson.
Finally, one of them guesses where Doug might be then they have to get
back in time for the wedding.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Some what entertaining, but I was disappointed. Still
worth checking out since so many people thought it was better than me.
