I hate fanboys who feel that they can&#39;t call a turd a turd if it
belongs to one of their favorite franchises. I bet most of the people
giving this crapfest glowing reviews will later recant and rip on it as
well. They&#39;d disavow their reviews here if they weren&#39;t saved on the
internet for all posterity. I&#39;ve seen fanboys do it with Romero&#39;s Land
of the Dead and with Richard Kelly&#39;s Southland Tales.<br /><br />RE Degeneration has decent computer animation. However, I thought it
also had worse animation than Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within had...
which came out eight years ago! So, when people are saying that they
are not quite &quot;Pixar quality&quot;... keep in mind that it&#39;s not as good of
quality as other computer animated anime from years ago either.<br /><br />Sound effects were decently handled. Zombie moans sounded like zombie
moans. What else can I say? The music score was okay, basically it just
blended into the background. Basically, &quot;eh&quot;.<br /><br />The plot. Now the fanboys here will be telling you that this movie is
for fans of the videogames. Bullcrap. I&#39;m a big fan of the videogames.
This movie was an insult to the fanbase. The plot... if you could call
it that, is crap. I know of tons of B-Budget zombie flicks with better
plots. The live-action RE movie had a far better plot than this. Hell,
ALL the live-action RE movies had better plots than this one!!!!!<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of this was we got to see some of our
beloved RE characters again. However, they feel hollow in this
rendition. I really wouldn&#39;t have cared if Claire got bitten by the end
of the movie. <br /><br />All in all... as a zombie-flick fan, I&#39;m disappointed. As a Resident
Evil fan, I feel betrayed.
