First off- I have a lot of respect for the resident evil games,I know
they are at least solid enough to warrant several sequel games. I also
know there is one or two good guys, a whack of zombies and usually a
decked out uber badass boss character. I don&#39;t know much more, and for
that reason, this movie really didn&#39;t do much for me.<br /><br />There were too many moments throughout where some random guy/girl would
show up, that im sure any resident evil fan would freak out at- but i
just had no clue what the significance was. copious references that
went over my head that one of the gamers would catch...made me
basically feel out of the loop on this one.<br /><br />I think I felt like one of my firends I&#39;ve forced to watch advent
children with no knowledge of Final Fantasy 7. there is just too much
insider stuff for casual viewers.<br /><br />wooden character animation, and above average vg cutscene style- but a
very cool fight at the end, some decent gore kept up the pace.<br /><br />defiantly recommend you check this out if you&#39;ve played the games,
however I would be very wary if your new to the Resident Evil universe,
this is likely not the best place to start.
