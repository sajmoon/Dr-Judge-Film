I love the live-action movies.<br /><br />Alright, an overstatement. They serve their purpose of a woman jumping
around scantily clad killing zombies for ninety-plus minutes. I can&#x27;t,
and don&#x27;t really want to, ask for more than that. But along comes
Capcom basing an animated movie on the games more faithfully that the
live-action film with admittedly mixed results.<br /><br />First off, let me say I&#x27;ve never played the games. My only experience
is the live-action films starring Milla Jovovich. Now, this film
actually uses characters from the games (as well as the voice actors)
to tell a story in the RE universe with more faith towards the games.
However, unlike another CG movie sequel, Final Fantasy VII: Advent
Children, one can easily walk into this film without prior knowledge of
the games.<br /><br />This is a stand-alone work that also integrates into a specific place
in the Biohazard/Resident Evil canon. Its story is more patient than
FFVII, but the two have one major thing in common - multiple endings. I
remember thinking throughout both &#x22;Holy crap, it&#x27;s STILL going?!&#x22; I
look forward to Resident Evil Damnation, a sequel to this, and the
sixth overall Resident Evil film released. It&#x27;s getting a 3D theatrical
release in Japan, so I write this in hope that there will be at least
an American Blu-Ray release, if not an Australian Blu-Ray release, in
3D, if not theatrically released.<br /><br />I love the Resident Evil universe and would buy the games off eBay if I
wasn&#x27;t so broke. 3.5 stars
