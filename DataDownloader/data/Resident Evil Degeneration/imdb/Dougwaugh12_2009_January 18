Im a fan of resident evil and cannot wait for the fifth game. I see
this movie as an appetizer for the 5th game. but i went out and bought
the DVD and watched it once. During the whole runtime, i was very
bored! The first 30 minutes of degeneration were quite cool and
entertaining, but after that. Everything went downhill and was quite a
bore. Leon was also not as entertaining as he was in 2 and 4. So i
watched it a second time and fell asleep! so the first half was good
but the rest of the movie is a snooze! It had a lot of potential to be
a really great film, but lost it. Im not a fan for the live action
versions but they were more entertaining than degeneration. So when
your watching it, try not to fall asleep by the over exaggerated scenes
of characters staring at each other in the eye&#39;s. I believe the whole
drama thing was overdone and boring.
