OK...To be kind, it is a much better film than the live action
attempts. I understand the intense efforts that must go into a film
like this, so I won&#39;t just &quot;Worst film ever&quot; my review. The problems I
had with this film is that we are NOwhere near the ability to pull off
a fully functional fully CGI film that is not crippled by the infant
abilities of CGI film technology. Your probably saying whaddayamean?!
Basically Resident Evil requires horror, suspense, fear, anticipation,
and mystery to make it work. That is what made the game franchise a
hit. Successfully bringing these elements from film into a video game
that actually was scary. The CGI characters lack a sense of life &amp; soul
that in live action is essential to conveying a character you care
about in a horror situation.There is little emotion in the eyes not to
mention the very poor voice acting. Who ever says the acting was OK
must have graduated from the Keanu Reeves school of drama majoring in
cardboard impersonation. Simply put, you can&#39;t have a film based on a
video game that was rooted in survival/horror be a film that isn&#39;t
horrifying. It just caused me to tire putting effort into trying to
keep up.<br /><br />This film would have been major had it been released in &#39;98 or &#39;99, say
ala Animatrix style. A straight to DVD film that tells the story in
between games similar to what the film does. The action here was
immature, out of date and resolute to be post-Matrix reliant on look
and feel. Bullets followed by camera at super slo-mo to point of
contact, silly angle changes around source of action as to say &quot;Look,
look he shot him real cool and sexy like!&quot;...and speaking of action
since when did Resident Evil become a Saturday morning cartoon version
of a John Woo film instead of a survival/horror franchise. Maybe the
people who really loved the RE games, or thought that Star Wars Episode
1, 2 &amp; 3 should have won Oscars, or fans of Twilight enjoyed it. No
matter how you slice it, this was an effort that just didn&#39;t raise the
bar enough. I really wanted to love it and almost bought in on Itunes,
but for a game as revolutionary as RE was in &#39;96 &amp; &#39;98 this deserved to
be a better film.
