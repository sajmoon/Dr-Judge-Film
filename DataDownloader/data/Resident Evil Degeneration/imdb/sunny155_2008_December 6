Finally, a TRUE Resident Evil movie has come after the utter failure of
the crap Trilogy. The re trilogy films really messed up the story and
unnecessarily inserted new characters like Alice. Thanks to CAPCOM for
Reincarnating the Spirit of Resident Evil Game in the movie. The RE
Trilogy have completely destroyed the story and wasted such an epic
title. The Trilogy movies should have never been made by Hollywood and
should be made by the game producer CAPCOM. <br /><br />I watched this movie yesterday night and it reminded me of my most
beloved game which i played tens of times. I very rarely comment on
movies but after watching this movie i couldn&#39;t stop myself to write a
comment. <br /><br />The story continues after Resident Evil 2 game. Its really nice to see
the characters from the game - Leon S Kennedy, Claire Redfield. Both
were the protagonists of Re2 game episodes. Both characters are
perfectly modeled as they were in the game. Even the Costumes of the
characters are same. Faces of characters are nicely made and Claire
Redfield looks very sweet and cute. The movie also references stories
from RE 1&amp;2 game. The movie is full of scenes from the past games and
so the movie is faithful to the re games series. The boss of the re2
game is in the movie too. CG &amp; Voice performance is superb. <br /><br />Ultimately CAPCOM delivered a Movie which gamers were expecting to see
from many years. I think its just the beginning, future movies from
CAPCOM will be more intense and action packed and will be faithful to
the game. I strongly recommend this movie to those who watched the crap
trilogy, and feel the REAL Resident Evil, and off-course the gamers of
RE games who waited long to see this movie.<br /><br />My 9/10 to this movie.
