Upon watching this film, I really did not know what to expect. My
anticipations were more than met, and the storyline much farther
exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen many &#39;newcomer&#39; opinions being thrown out there, so allow me
to reply with my own. The movie was not redone to suit the English
language, therefore the motions were not in sync. To anyone who judges
that harshly on an animated film. I&#39;d say take your criticism to
something a little more worthwhile, as this was already a known fact,
before the movies release.<br /><br />**Moving on, if you have NOT played the video games, I would suggest
leaving your opinions at the door, before viewing. Or do yourself a
favour, find a compatible console, and play some R.E.2. It will
definitely help to clarify a few things for you**<br /><br />Clearly those who haven&#39;t yet broken into the v.g. scene, will not know
how to take this film. Also, for those that have, don&#39;t expect ...well
anything, as far as the storyline goes. Need to keep an open mind for
this one.<br /><br />Too many people are anticipating the past to repeat itself. This is a
completely new story, irrelevant to past story lines, other than the
theme and its returning characters. There are quite a few references
however, but this is by no means a continuation. As Code Veronica was
to R.E.2, for example.<br /><br />It was a well conducted piece of work. Nothing at all far-fetched for
the video game world. Entertaining from beginning to end. The lead
characters portraying themselves, in typical R.E. fashion. This time
around giving you a bit more of a feel for who they are, that the games
may not allow. You get all the blood &amp; zombies you would in your games,
and the ever loved cut-scenes of the v.g. franchise.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know that there is any relation to the upcoming R.E.5. However,
I do believe that many gamers will find much speculation and
possibility of continuation, upon release of the latest chapter of the
saga. Having seen the trailer for the new game, and without giving
anything away, I believe there very well might be. The DVD does come
with a preview of the new game, which should help provide some insight
on this matter. (That in itself may be a hint)<br /><br />All in all, a good film. It held my attention every step of the way.
Now, if they could just get the motion pictures right, we might have
something a little more entertaining to watch while waiting for new
games to be released. <br /><br />9/10 Coming from a fan of the games. If I weren&#39;t a fan, I would want
to be after this viewing. Can&#39;t wait for another.
