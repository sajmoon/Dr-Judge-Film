Strictly only for fan-boys who drool watching their favourite
characters appearing on screen. For the rest of non-fans, they are only
stiff movie characters with bad acting.<br /><br />A disappointing movie. A waste for such a great franchise and use of
animation. Too much emphasize on the characters. Not enough on the
whole t-virus and zombies issues.<br /><br />For a movie done using animation, the limit is the imagination. They
could have done something of a bigger scale. Something big that nothing
life-action can do. But they wasted this in trying to develop some
characters. End up giving the feel of watching some in-game movies.
Such a shame for this good franchise.
