2009_September 21 
Like most fans of the Resident Evil games, I was less than impressed
with the movie cash-ins started by Paul W.S. Anderson in 2002.
Therefore, I was delighted when I found that Sony were releasing a
&#x27;true&#x27; Resident Evil film, done in the style of the games (computer
animated) and featuring real Resident Evil characters. It&#x27;s very clear
from the outset that this is a Resident Evil film purely for fans and I
highly doubt that anyone who doesn&#x27;t love the games will be impressed
by it. As a film in its own right, it has to be said that it is a bit
lacking; but it&#x27;s still a treat for fans and a lot better than the
live-action counterparts. The film focuses on Resident Evil 2&#x27;s
protagonists; Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Claire just happens to
be at an airport where a T-virus outbreak takes place. She manages to
survive the initial outbreak along with a few other people. Shortly
after, Leon Kennedy is sent in to save the day, and after doing so; the
pair realise that they&#x27;re up against a much bigger threat.<br /><br />The film is very much like the games; although less exciting since the
audience does not get an opportunity to pick up a controller and have a
go at blasting zombies themselves. However, it features many trademarks
of the series and the animators really did get that side of the movie
spot on. Unfortunately, the awful dialogue also makes an appearance
(though thankfully there&#x27;s nothing to rival the &#x22;Jill Sandwich&#x22;).
There&#x27;s also a number of nods to the game...some of which, it has to be
said, are a bit ham-fisted. The story itself is not great and really
doesn&#x27;t get going, which is a bit of a shame. The first half of the
film is more action packed, while the second part of the film is more
story-orientated and is probably the one that will most interest fans
of the series. There&#x27;s not a great deal of characterisation, although
that&#x27;s not too big a problem as the target audience will already know
enough about the main players. All in all, I have to say that this film
is not great; but it&#x27;s a fun watch and Resident Evil fans shouldn&#x27;t be
disappointed.
