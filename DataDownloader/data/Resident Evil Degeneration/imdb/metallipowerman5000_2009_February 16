I laughed when i saw the DVD for sale....<br /><br />I was thinking to myself &quot;wow, after officially RUINING the resident
evil name, now they are just trying another desperate move here...&quot;<br /><br />But the movie was actually decent and cool....<br /><br />I thought Resident Evil 1 was pretty good, pretty realistic with the
exception of the whole &quot;conspiracy/ trained killer&quot; thing going on...<br /><br />RE2 excited me because they are in the city...how awesome...but it just
turns into street fighter with zombies, and has a typically lame story
line with bad acting....and that stupid black/pimp wannabe guy....Don&#39;t
even get me started, he should have been turned down faster than the
economy! But hey...its a zombie movie...so i&#39;ll watch it.<br /><br />RE3 was awesome because it was in the DESERT, which i thought was
awesome....and this is actually my favorite RE right next to RE1. But
they attempted to cash in and copy the whole &quot;hyper zombie&quot; trend going
on years before....but it wasn&#39;t THAT bad of a zombie movie...if you
can call them zombies....I Wouldn&#39;t!<br /><br />Resident Evil Degeneration did something the other RE&#39;s couldn&#39;t. It
kept it as close to the video game as possible, while keeping a
realistic feel to it(not bad for a 3d animation.) The movie felt like
you were watching an hour long trailer for Left 4 Dead....which i
thought was really cool! And it&#39;s a 3d movie, so you cant complain
about the final boss at the end of the movie.<br /><br />It reminded me almost EXACTLY like that Final Fantasy movie back in
2001, which was also a 3d animation movie.....so if you like those
kinds of movie, you&#39;ll definitely like Degeneration.<br /><br />Gotta give em ALITTLE credit this time....they didn&#39;t screw it up this
time! With how fake the other resident evils were, they should have
just been doing 3d movies from the BEGINNING!<br /><br />----<br /><br />I&#39;ve ALWAYS been a huge fan of resident evil,etc.... You HAVE to admit,
the first 3 movies they did were JUNK! They were totally fake and
unrealistic(for a zombie movie), had too much &quot;cover-up and conspiracy&quot;
crap, that even the GAME didn&#39;t have. The acting was usually bad...it
HAD what could have been a good plot or story, but it&#39;s just like
someone had a major identity crisis between what a GAME is, and what a
MOVIE should be. He needs to go back to film school and learn how to
ACTUALLY transfer a video-game to a movie script.... (which is obvious
since the last 3 resident evils didn&#39;t even really make it to theaters)<br /><br />All the dumbass had to do was write a basic script along the lines of
what direction the GAME was going!(and not wasting time on wacky story
lines and fake stuff)<br /><br />I don&#39;t think im going to see the next movie...it&#39;ll probably be based
off of Resident Evil 5 video game.....which could be an ABSOLUTELY
AWESOME zombie/plague/infection movie....its PERFECT.<br /><br />But somehow they will probably screw up the movie anyways! Id be
surprised if the next resident evil movie even makes it to DVD! It&#39;ll
be STARTING OFF in the $5 bin at Wal-mart!
