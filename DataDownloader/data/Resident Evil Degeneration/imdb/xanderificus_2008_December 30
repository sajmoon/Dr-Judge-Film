Not being a video game fan, I&#39;ve not seen the cut-scenes of the game. I
feel like I just watched an 96 minutes of them. Cut-scenes are, I
believe, something that are, by definition of their own name, only to
be used as brief interludes.<br /><br />I couldn&#39;t help but compare this CG movie with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; of a few
years ago. During that film, I was able to lose myself long enough to
forget that the well-animated characters weren&#39;t real. Here, the
low-grade CG, lack of attempt to synchronize lips to speech,
high-school-drama dialog, all bring the package to a point that makes
the cartoon &quot;ReBoot&quot; look like Oscar quality.
