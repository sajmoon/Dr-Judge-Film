I&#39;ve been a fan of Resident Evil : the movie and the game too. So when
I found this flick, I readily watched it. Its not bad but its not in
the line with previous Resident Evil movies.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is its trying to drag the same plot that
was introduced in the first movie to new stretches. It would&#39;ve worked
had this been a shoot&#39;em-all game but this is a movie. In fact a lot of
scenes in the movie give you a feeling like you are playing the game.<br /><br />I gave it a five because of some great GFX. Could&#39;ve been better if the
movie had a better storyline.<br /><br />My take : Rent it if you have a lazy Sunday afternoon and nothing much
to do. Don&#39;t expect too much from the movie and you might even like it.
