If you are a big fan of the Resident Evil video game franchise you&#39;ll
probably love this. If you are a fan of the live action movies (like
me) you&#39;ll probably hate it.<br /><br />This movie bears no relation at all to the movies. The only thing it
has in common are some names. Plenty of reviewers have made much of the
fact that this movie has more in common with the games than the
live-action films do. Well that&#39;s only a plus if you have actually
played the games and enjoyed them. Fans of the movies will be at a loss
trying to figure out what the heck is going on.<br /><br />As far as the animation goes: See the title of this comment. It is
indeed nothing more than a very extended video game cut-scene. Granted
it looks as good as if that cut-scene was played back on the biggest
and fastest game system available but that still puts it on a level
below many other 3D animated films. Lip sync is non-existent so it&#39;s
like watching a foreign movie dubbed into English. Which is exactly
what this is. Facial expressions often do not match the emotion of the
voice actor&#39;s performance. It&#39;s quite disconcerting to see a calm face
when the voice is full of panic. In short: It&#39;s very good from a video
game standpoint but sub par from a film standpoint.<br /><br />Voice actors: Purely second string talent here. There&#39;s probably nobody
that you ever heard of before. They aren&#39;t bad but they really don&#39;t do
anything exceptionally well. Say what you want about Milla Jovovitch,
but at least she can create a memorable performance.<br /><br />Characterizations: Quite sub par. All the clich&eacute; characters that are
present in most games and films of this genre. There is no character
development.<br /><br />Music and Sound: Both are at standard video game level and don&#39;t add
much to a film experience.<br /><br />Conclusion: Only for fans of the game and those who just love any kind
of zombie flick. If you are an action movie fan: This film fails on
several levels. Mostly because an action film needs realistic action.
If you are a horror movie fan: Well it&#39;s just not scary. If you are an
animation fan: You might enjoy it.<br /><br />This movie lacks a &quot;Wow factor&quot; that would make it&#39;s shortcomings less
important.
