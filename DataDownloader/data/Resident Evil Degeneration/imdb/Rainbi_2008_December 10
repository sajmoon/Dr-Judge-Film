who ever thinks otherwise must be jealous Leon was great Claire was
great oh and how about the CG on Curtis miller when he transforms
incredibly great overall this is the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen and I&#39;ve
heard most people say this including my whole family I will buy both
the DVD and PSP formats I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve heard people say some bad
things about it when it&#39;s simply amazing you can&#39;t get any better than
zombies in a airport than a big monster for the end the voice acting
again was like a real Hollywood movie I was very impressed and I hope
many others think this I heard that 80 thousand people downloaded this
movie when it was released again incredible please people just buy I
know fans will all I leave you with is wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Great great great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
