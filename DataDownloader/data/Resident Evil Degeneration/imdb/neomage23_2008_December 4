2008_December 4 
It is my opinion that this movie is quite excellent for what it
is...and it is a &quot;survival horror film&quot; - and, at that, it is inspired
with by a lot of information in the RE games.<br /><br />From the standpoint of a Resident evil fan, I was so incredibly
frustrated with the Paul Anderson films. I mean, it&#39;s like the dude
never even heard of Resident Evil. Somehow, though, he&#39;s made three
films about it. He doesn&#39;t follow the storyline of the games. I really
wish that they would pull the plug on &quot;Anderson&quot; and make another
animated film. It would be especially cool if they based the next
animated film on events involving background (or continuation of) the
upcoming game RE5. The games Resident Evil 1-4 + Code:Veronica - all of
them had interesting story lines. The books written by SD Perry had
interesting story lines and were well written. Anderson is not a good
movie maker.<br /><br />But I digress...<br /><br />From the standpoint of an avid film watcher...the animation was
excellent, the storyline was interesting, and the voice acting was
good. I can see how this movie might seem a little campy or bland if
you don&#39;t like survival horror movies or concepts, but I liked it...a
lot.<br /><br />If they had added an hour to this film and filled that hour with
&quot;flashback sequences&quot; or something similar that explained more about
the background of the story I think it would have been a superb, top
notch survival horror film. I really hope they make another...<br /><br />-neo P.S. Nice job Shotaro Suga!
