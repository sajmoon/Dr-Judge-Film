Resident Evil Degeneration is Pretty solid on many levels when it comes
to a movie:- 1. Good Voice acting- everyone seems to enjoy their
dialogue and so does the audience 2. The story- while it doesn&#39;t live
up to the stories of the RE games its still pretty good and not too
predictable 3. The action - top notch. The action is well executed,
stylish and not overdone. 4. The CGI- Visually amazing and a
breakthrough for all cgi movies to come<br /><br />The Bad:- 1. Leon- while he still is the zombie ass-kicking hero we
love, his character is just out of place and so is his charming boyish
face. He looks like he&#39;s in his 40&#39;s and way too stiff. I was just
praying for him to punch a cheesy one liner but sadly he never does.<br /><br />2. Claire- while she isn&#39;t useless in the movie she isn&#39;t given much
screen time either. She&#39;s just there. <br /><br />Overall, RE Degeneration is rock solid
