If you have played and loved the game(s) of Resident Evil, than this is
a must watch. There is not really much story, but to me it has the
right feel to it and that matters, I didn&#x27;t watch this movie or played
the games for the story. Well, OK, just a little bit, but even so, the
lack of story didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s motion capture animated.
The only thing on this movie that could use some improvement is the
moving of the lips when someone is speaking, it&#x27;s like they mumble (the
movement) but the voice you hear does articulate (the lips don&#x27;t) Oh,
and off course when you&#x27;re used to have this story told to you over the
duration of multiple hours (in the games) then this movie feels way to
short, especially when you liked it. ;)
