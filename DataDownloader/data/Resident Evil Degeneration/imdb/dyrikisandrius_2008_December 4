2008_December 4 
OK first I am gonna clear up that I am actually a big admirer of the
resident evil game franchise(hated the movies...their only purpose was
to make money from a popular game)I have played from resident evil 1 in
the mansion with the corny live acting to resident evil 4 epic game(and
all games from third to first person in between).<br /><br />Now I am truly annoyed by the fact that this franchise is only been
milk for money now, this cg movie its a bad joke with good animations
and thats it, all the acting or character interactions felt like a
cheap soap opera where you never associated yourself with them or even
felt any emotion where there should be plenty. I have only read a
review made by another person that seems to be a mindless fanatic or a
part of the publicity team of the movie(if there&#39;s any) and I can tell
you as a true admirer of resident evil (the game), this is not even
close to the quality that the games are so popular for.....and thats
just sad.<br /><br />9.1/10??? I feel like all the people that worked in the movie or expect
money from it decided to come here and vote because its not even near
an 8 or a 6 for that matter, I am giving it a 3/10, I hoped that this
was going be something near the quality of FF7 advent child but boy I
was wrong!
