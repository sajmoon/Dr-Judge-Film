I guess it achieved what it wanted, however, as a movie, I think it&#39;s
not much of a film, though. Evil government officials, people driven to
insanity by their ordeal, corrupt scientists, valiant, but ultimately
inconsequential good looking action heroes and the happy ending (for
anyone but the supporting roles, obviously) are all there is to it.<br /><br />But what about the games?! I haven&#39;t really played any RE games. I
don&#39;t know if they are more fun than the movies, but I would venture
they are.<br /><br />But what about the horror?! No horror. Even the animated sequences were
censored. The infected are reduced to mere slow brainless zombies while
the ultra-zombie is almost beautiful, if it weren&#39;t terribly
asymmetric. If asymmetry scares you, though, you should not watch this
movie :)
