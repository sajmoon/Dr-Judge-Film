If you&#39;re a fan of the live action versions of Resident Evil, then this
CGI flick is likely to disappoint. You don&#39;t get Milla Jovovich, but
you do get the reunion of two faces from the games: Leon Kennedy and
Jill Valentine.<br /><br />Other reviewers have inevitably compared this film to Final Fantasy
VII: Advent Children, which is a little unfair. FF VII seemed
preoccupied with beautiful visuals, whereas Resi is trying to tell a
story and the visuals are simply a means to an end. Sometimes the
quality dips a little too far and it feels like you&#39;re watching an
extended cut scene from the game (which in a sense you are) but always
remains entertaining and watchable.<br /><br />It feels like Resi should, it looks like Resi should, so it gets a
thumbs up from me.
