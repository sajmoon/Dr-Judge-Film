I don&#39;t care if your a fan of the games or previous movies or not. This
movie is just plain bad. Scenery and other parts of the animation look
stunning, and a lot of the action sequences are quite well made. This
though is the only reason not to give this movie a rating of 1 or 2.<br /><br />-The plot is utterly predictable to put it mildly.<br /><br />-Character animation looks very &quot;stiff&quot; and out of place.<br /><br />-Dialog is so horribly clich&eacute;d, utterly pointless and unnatural it
would make a 3year old cringe.<br /><br />-And don&#39;t get me started on the pacing. &quot;lets stop for 20 seconds
while zombies are chasing us and look deeply into each others eyes&quot; and
other pointless things of similar nature.&quot; <br /><br />As a whole though the movie is mildly entertaining.
