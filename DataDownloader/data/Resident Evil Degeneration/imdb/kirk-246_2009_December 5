What is it about the &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27; movies that makes them
entertaining.Is it the zombies? Is it the main character? Is it the
action? How about all three? &#x27;Degeneration&#x27; has all of those things and
the result is an action-packed CGI fest filled with ugly monsters and
mayhem.What&#x27;s special about this film unlike the others is that this
film is animated and not live action.This isn&#x27;t just animation like you
see in &#x27;Toy Story&#x27;.This is top notch animation that looks too real to
even be called CGI.The effects may not be as grand as &#x27;Wall-e&#x27;, but
it&#x27;s spectacular nonetheless.Is this movie a masterpiece by any means?
Not really.Is it Oscar worthy? I wouldn&#x27;t say so.Is it a film that fans
of the movies and video games should check out? I think it is.If you
can handle being in front of a video game look-a-like that you can&#x27;t
play but you really want to, then this movie is for you.<br /><br />B+
