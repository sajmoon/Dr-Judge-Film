Anyone who&#39;s watched the W.S Anderson resident evils will probably
agree with me that they weren&#39;t the best of all films, especially to
the fans of the video games. Although the 3rd film was the best one in
terms of story and general interest, it just didn&#39;t have that feel
resident evil should have had, and it certainly didn&#39;t feel like it
should have a sequel at all.<br /><br />However Resident Evil Degeneration is a definite change for the better
and should the canon continue, will be much more successful than the
previous films. Firstly the film is in CGI, and good CGI at that, so
there&#39;s definitely no holding back on the cool action scenes that would
be too dangerous or hard to do using real actors. It&#39;s always good to
see slick acrobatic scenes with great angles in that seems to be done
best when using CGI.<br /><br />Secondly the story is a lot better, and I do mean a lot better, no more
convoys, no more Alaska and no more clones; it&#39;s what resident evil
should be and that&#39;s a real bonus for the fans, I won&#39;t say what
Degeneration is all about, only that it is definitely worth the look.
So....How about number 2?
