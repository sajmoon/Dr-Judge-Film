2008_December 5 
I gave it a 7 because I&#39;m a geek to the games, and this is pretty loyal
to the series. In truth, as a critic, I&#39;d say a 6 would be a more
accurate portrayal of my review. <br /><br />First, it&#39;s really awesome to see Claire and Leon together again.
There&#39;s plenty of action, and the zombies are fun when they pop up
(mostly at the airport setting - which is actually not a setting it
takes place in for the majority of the movie, just to say). <br /><br />It&#39;s not a perfect movie though, and I can&#39;t help but draw comparisons
in ways which &quot;Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children&quot; suffered from (which
was a movie I utterly despised). While you don&#39;t have to have played
the game to understand it (unlike FF7) - yeah, you&#39;re definitely gonna
have to be a fan of the series to truly appreciate it. <br /><br />It looks beautiful, but there&#39;s the every-now-&amp;-then when the
characters still look and move too CGI-ish. And I can&#39;t help but notice
how Leon has more Japanese facial features here. The plot works enough
for a story to tell, but it seems to force in some cheesy melodrama,
and the typical &quot;if you ain&#39;t important, you&#39;re meat&quot; thing. The way it
moves and ends, I wonder if anything here will even be incorporated to
the game arc, or if it was really its own story (because it feels like
it)... like the games, some things aren&#39;t entirely resolved and new
questions are made (and with the games going zombie-less, it makes you
wonder!). <br /><br />Still, if you&#39;re a fan, it&#39;s definitely worth watching -- you got the
pair again (and I&#39;m always pleased with Alyson Court continuing to
reprise her role; there&#39;s no other Claire!), you got real zombies
again, and it&#39;s all about kicking back and just watching them kick
serious ass!
