&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; fails to match Paul W.S. Anderson&#39;s
original installment but there are still enough reasons to spend 90-odd
minutes watching this lightweight action-horror film.<br /><br />The film has more than its fair share of colourful explosions, nasty
zombies both human and canine, big monsters and large guns (and big
monsters with guns!). It also has two of the screen&#39;s sexiest ladies,
Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory.<br /><br />The tense excitement of the first movie is missing but this is still a
decent, high-budget, glossy popcorn movie.<br /><br />7 out of 10.
