Ignore the Resident Evil fan boys for a few seconds and with this film
you can seriously sit down and enjoy. Now i'm a huge fan of the RE
series, Resident Evil 4 is my favorite game! But the bullshit following
the &quot;shit&quot; Resident Evil movies is all biased. Paul W.S Anderson's work
on this film was short to say the least. He really needed to direct
this film. Alexander Witt did a good job, but he didn't know squat
about the RE games. He just filmed what Paul sent to him. Anyone can do
that. Paul's touch on the RE series in his first movie was mind
blowing. I and every other person in the cinema gasped, and enjoyed the
whole thing. After waiting 2 painful years for the sequel, it was
released. I went to the premiere here and i loved it. It made me jump,
it sucked me in. It even gave me the feel of RE. Which isn't just
creaky doors and footsteps off in the distance, its a group of
characters fighting against zombies. That just screams action. Sure the
acting is cheesy, but that can be ignored with Milla being as sexy as
she is. Seriously people, just take one step back from the whole RE
game thing, and watch it for a movie. Its awesome. Paul W.S needs to
direct Afterlife or the same bad and bashed reviews will come back to
haunt him again. Screw AvP 2 Paul.. It sucked ass, move on to better
things.
