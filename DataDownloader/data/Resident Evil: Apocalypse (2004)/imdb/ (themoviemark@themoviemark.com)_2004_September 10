Here's a warning to all movie snobs - STAY AWAY! Everybody else go have
a good time. I really enjoyed the movie, but let me fill you in on
where I'm coming from:<br /><br />1) I like the Resident Evil video games. <br /><br />2) I love watching Milla kick decayed zombie butt. <br /><br />3) I love the addition of another hot babe who knows how to kick
decayed zombie butt.<br /><br />If you identify with the above, then this is the movie for you. Also,
keep in mind that a person's level of enjoyment for a movie like this
goes down as his age goes up. Let me put this in fundamental terms:
this is all about Milla in tight outfits, shooting guns, back flipping
off motorcycles, breaking zombie necks, and just looking mighty fine
doing it all. Folks, that's all I really need sometimes. Oh, and Sienna
Guillory doesn't exactly open the eyes of the Oscar voters, but she
sure makes a sexy Jill Valentine!<br /><br />Atmosphere plays a big part as well. Things are often loud, dark, and
chaotic. So you can expect a booming soundtrack, a handful of jump
scenes, and a whole lot of gory deaths. My main complaint is that
sometimes things are a little too chaotic, especially in some fight
scenes. The camera is too close to fully absorb everything that's
happening. Come on cameramen, pull back a little.<br /><br />One thing many zombie movies lack is a main antagonist. Characters
usually have to deal with a bunch of generic zombies chasing after
them, but that's not the case here. Nemesis is one scary monstrosity.
I've played the video game, and he's something you don't want on your
tail. The addition of the Lickers (creatures from the game) is also a
nice touch. The CGI is well done.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for an all-out, non-stop thrill ride that is
intent on preventing you from catching your breath, and you don't
insist on the deepest story in the world, then there's really no reason
not to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. And ladies, I know I've gone on
about the lovely Milla, but if you have the slightest interest in
zombie movies or you just like fast-paced action with a serving of
gore, then there's plenty for you to enjoy as well.<br /><br />In terms of pure entertainment value this falls between 3.5 and 4
marks. I'm gonna shake up my rating system and give it a 3.75!!! It's
Friday; you never know what kind of wild antics I might get up to.<br /><br />THE GIST<br /><br />Please don't go into this movie expecting anything resembling realism.
Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a movie based on a video game, and in my
opinion, it's exactly what a video game inspired movie should be. It's
gory, it's violent, it's got lots of heavy artillery, it's got a super
cool villain, it's got well-toned heroines puttin' on a show ... in
other words, this is the movie most adrenaline-fueled guys have been
waiting for all year.
