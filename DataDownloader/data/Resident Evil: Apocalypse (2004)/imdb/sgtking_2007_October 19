The original &#39;Resident Evil&#39; was a much needed shot of life in the arm
of the walking dead subgenre. The film was a hit and also left the door
wide open for a sequel, which we got two years later. The end of that
film was pretty kick-ass and made it look like the sequel would be a
sort of large-scale action/horror flick even better than it&#39;s
predecessor. Is that what we got? Well, like a lot of sequels,
Apocalypse pales in comparison to the first, which really is a shame
because the first was really a promising start for a franchise. Still,
this first of two sequels that have come so far is at least OK
entertainment.<br /><br />Pros: Moves at a decent pace. Slick and stylish like it&#39;s predecessor.
The actors do the best they can with what they have to work with. Good
special, make-up, and visual effects work. Plenty of explosions,
gunfire, and some neat stunts to please action fans. A few memorable
moments. Nice production design. An inferior, but still good action
score.<br /><br />Cons: Paper thin plot. The script is a bit rough in spots, especially
in the first third. Like the original, this sequel borrows from better
films and has only little to no originality. Doesn&#39;t have nearly as
many moments that stay with you as the first, so unfortunately it&#39;s a
bit forgettable.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The original was a really promising start for the
series, and the end promised great things. Did this sequel deliver? In
terms of action and horror, sure. But as far as expanding the story set
up in number one and showing us new sites, it doesn&#39;t quite make the
grade. Still, it&#39;s never boring, has plenty action scenes, zombies and
other creatures, and a sexy cast. So at the very least it&#39;s mindless
fun.<br /><br />My rating: 3/5
