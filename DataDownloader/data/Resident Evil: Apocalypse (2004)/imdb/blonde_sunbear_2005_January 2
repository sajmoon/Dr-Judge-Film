2005_January 2 
Just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. I was a fan of the
videogames which the movies are loosely based on. That being said I am
no fanboy and you will find that this is an unbiased review. I was
pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. The movie does seem
to convey a sense of suspense and the fight scenes are action packed.
Computer animated special effects were below average. The makeup job
they did for the zombies slightly makes up for it. I did not notice as
many plot holes as I expected for a action movie based on a video game
to have. The &quot;nemesis&quot;, who is the toughest zombie, looks absolutely
horrible. The makeup and costume just looks entirely fake. Fun, worth a
rental at most. If you are a superfan of the videogames buy the
criterion collection (Hahaha).<br /><br />7 out of 10
