Excellent is an understatement to describe this film because...i was
simply blown away by it. Usually sequels are nothing compared to the
predecessors but this holds its own. Milla jovovich and Sienna Guillory
look great as Alice and Jill Valentine which adds to the films
aesthetic beauty. There is action galore with explosions and fight
scenes a regular occurrence with foes such as zombies, dogs, lickers
and of course the dreaded NEMESIS who by the way looks amazing in real
life form (Stars!) The stunts are all dazzling but the best by far has
to be Alice's run down the side of a sky-scraper which the crew
actually did for real. This is brilliant and should be watched by
everyone. &quot;My name.... is Alice.... and this movie kicks arse!&quot;
