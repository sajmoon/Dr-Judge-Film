Resident Evil: Apocalypse is much like the first movie. Only this time
instead of making a movie that can be fit into the storyline of the
game, they completely invented a new one and changed an already awesome
story for the worse.<br /><br />The fun of the RE games was not seeing how many zombies you can kill
with your super-powers. It was about horror, suspense, and not knowing
when a giant leather-clad badass would bust in through the wall to give
you hell. That's where this and the first movie go wrong, it's not
scary at all, and it changes the game's already awesome storyline.<br /><br />As the biggest fan of the games, it dissapoints me to recommend the
new Dawn of the Dead over this. In terms of zombie flicks, that is.
