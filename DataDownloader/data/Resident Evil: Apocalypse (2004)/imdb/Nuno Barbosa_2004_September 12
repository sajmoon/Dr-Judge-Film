The first hour of the movie was really good. I'm a big FAN of the
RESIDENT EVIL video games and I thought it was very similliar to to the
games. When Alice &amp; Nemesis started fighting each other and then he
turned on Umbrella was very stupid and out of character. Anyhoo at
least he said &quot;S.T.A.R.S.&quot; once. Sienna Guillory was the BEST THING
ABOUT THE MOVIE. The actress portraying JILL VALENTINE, nailed her
character, she portrayed her really well. If there's a third part to
the franchise I hope that Alice is killed in the begginning of the
movie or she's not in it at all and hopefully they'll get rid of Paul
W. Anderson. I hope they bring Chris Redfield and Barry Burton and
Albert Albert Wesker as the main villain of the movie.
