I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil series, I've played and beaten them
all, so I have at least some knowledge to the plots of the game. I saw
this movie, and I enjoyed every bit of it, I admit that some of camera
jerking got on my nerves, but enjoyable nonetheless. Why would anyone
see this movie if we knew exactly what it was about? I'm glad they
added some things in that weren't in the original games. Jill was most
definitely my favorite character. What's great about the Resident Evil
series is that females can actually fight and defend themselves rather
than being lead around by a macho dude. Alice and Jill kick ass,
seriously. If you're sitting there nitpicking every little bloody
detail, then go ahead and hate this movie. For those of you who'll shut
up and enjoy it, you'll love it!
