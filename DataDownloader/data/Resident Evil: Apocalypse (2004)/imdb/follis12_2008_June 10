2008_June 10 
After I rented Extinction and watched it, I realized I had never seen
Apocalypse OR Resident Evil. I bought them rather than renting them,
and I was very pleased. The actors have truly outdone themselves, and
the extras are really good. If you have played the games, this movie
can help you to enjoy it more. I was just as equally shocked as my
friends when we saw the THREE lickers rather than the one. And that
Milla did all of her own stunts.......wow. BUT I thought Nemesis, and I
thought it was a little cheesy, a little over done. His make up was
very fake, and the lighting on him just wasn&#39;t sinister enough. other
than that, he was fine. When the zombie guys came out from the ground,
I was shocked. Yet again that is how the virus works. But still,
imagine being in the only &quot;safe&quot; place, and having (classic) zombies
coming up from the ground. Amazing<br /><br />9/10
