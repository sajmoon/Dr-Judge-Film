2004_September 10 

So let's face it: the first Resident Evil film was OKAY at best. Mildly
entertaining, but ultimately empty and horribly written like all Paul
W.S. Anderson films. But it made back its money and then some. Sequel
time :P<br /><br />To be honest, I was expecting this to be the worst sequel since Mortal
Kombat: Annihilation (another sequel Anderson handed off). That's NOT
the case. If you're not expecting Hamlet, and are just looking for a
good popcorn flick, RE: Apocalypse delivers in spades. This is one of
the only video game adaptations in recent memory that's managed to take
itself seriously and succeed (mostly.) I'm happy to report that this
flick isn't for kids...it's an honest to god R rated zombiefest, and
the violence, action, AND gore are kicked up a notch beyond Anderson's
first yawn of a zombie flick. And ya know, it also has a surprisingly
decent sense of humor- something MASSIVELY lacking in the first RE.
Mike Epps's one liner as he runs over a zombie policeman is an absolute
CLASSIC! (you'll know it when your hear it). Upon closer examination,
this massive scale zombie apocalypse owes more to 80's and 90's action
adventures than to anything of recent memory...(Milla's got the Sarah
Connor bit DOWN PAT, hehe) and it's a good deal of fun. Beautiful
lighting and camera work (when the editor isn't busy turning it into
quick cut mulch), a BUTTLOAD of action (the best I've seen in recent
years), and of course, superhotties. I'm happy to report the soda
depletes and popcorn rests easy in my stomach. Lots of fun to be had.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? More than a few things, naturally. Paul
Anderson's script, for one. It's sufficient, I'll give it that (perhaps
even moreso than AVP.) But a script doctor could have fixed a few leaks
in the plot and dialogue...really polished and delivered on some of
those bigger moments. The main grip however, is the EDITING....UGH!!!!
I'm actually considering contacting the editor of this film and
verbally ripping him a new orifice. The editing managed to butcher 75%
of what could have been the best action since the original Matrix. I've
never seen so much rapid fire editing in my life, and for a person that
appreciates SEEING his action (yes, SEEING is a major part of a movie),
this movie steps all over the viewer's attention span. It's like a
hypodermic injection of ADD, I swear. Also, the direction at times was
amateurish (what can be expected from an AD though), resulting in some
awkward moments here and there. More than anything though, I can't get
over the hyper-MTV editing. It ruined what could have been the best
scifi action film in years. ARE ANY STUDIO EXECS LISTENING?!?! RECUT
THE ACTION SEQUENCES, YOU MORONS! YOU HAVE A GEM HERE! OK. I'm relaxed.
But seriously...as an editor, it pains me to see this kind of garbage
editing. It's a copout. If I could get my hands on the source footage,
I'd whip the action back into shape. <br /><br />All in all? It's kinda like a windchill factor- it seems a lot cooler
than it really is. First time you see it, it'll feel like a 3 star
action flick. Without that initial breeze though...it's gonna drop down
several notches upon further viewings. The editing will make it
annoying to watch, and the plot/dialogue are gonna start to unravel
quicker than Steven Sommers's career post Van Helsing. Do yourself a
favor- bring some popcorn, pack up a one hitter, and leave your brain
at the door...you'll have a lot of fun, even if you didn't enjoy the
first film.
