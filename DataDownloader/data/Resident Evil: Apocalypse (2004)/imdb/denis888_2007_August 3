This is a very good sequel to RE that really thrilled me, shocked and
sent me creeps! I loved the first movie with its great tempo, thrilling
adventures, dead men walking, awesome Milla and excellent Michelle,
with its Red Queen and valiant fight for life. The sequel is not worse,
anyway. The whole city of Raccoon is plagued, dead are all around, and
only Milla again as Alice may save them all. She does. The movie never
gets boring or slow, it holds you glued and gets you more and more
excited. The very end makes you ask what the last part be? I am waiting
for the last part and just hope it will be better and not as bad as
Ultraviolet that is a shame. Milla rules and let us hope she will be as
great as she is here...
