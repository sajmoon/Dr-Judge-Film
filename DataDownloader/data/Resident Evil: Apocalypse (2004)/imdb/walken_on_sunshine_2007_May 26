In this sequel to 2002&#39;s video game adaptation of Resident Evil.The
virus has escaped to the city and Alice has escaped with abnormal
abilities and is aiding a group of survivors left for dead by the
deceitful Umbrella Corporation who plan to nuke it to get rid of and
cover up the zombie epidemic by all means necessary.<br /><br />Resident Evil Apocalypse is the perfect popcorn movie one of which you
cannot take seriously at all.It&#39;s pure entertainment and it knows it is
and it delivers what it promises to contain, a rush of non-stop
action.The movie strays further away from the games but adds two
existing game characters Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliviera.This movie
is meant as a big budget action film it&#39;s supposed to be over the top
and it&#39;s supposed to be a special effects extravaganza so of course
critics will over-analyze it and label it as garbage but those critics
don&#39;t know how to have a good time.<br /><br />The elements of cinema here are actually very good aside from one
thing.The acting is awesome a big improvement from the first Milla
Jovovich is more intense, Oded Fehr is as cool as ever, Sienna Guillory
is bad @$$, and Mike Epps is a riot.The visual effects are no longer
grainy and cold looking but they&#39;re sleek, glossy, with a Tim Burton
kind of feel by which i mean a lot of night settings but with lots of
various colours in the night settings.The dialogue is just brutal, it&#39;s
unbelievably clich&eacute; and not in a purposeful, campy way it&#39;s just plain
old bad dialogue and it totally distracts you from the films mood.Aside
from that there&#39;s more adrenaline pumped action, better gun brawls,
amazing martial arts choreography, great explosions, and realistic
gore.The plot is really interesting you really want to know the secrets
of Umbrella and once again were are left with a giant cliffhanger that
gets us looking forward to the third movie in theatres September 2007.<br /><br />Overall I have to say taking the film in a much lighter and humorous
tone made it far easier to enjoy the over the top action and
entertaining storyline unfold.It&#39;s obviously just made for fun, there&#39;s
no uplifting message just pure brain off entertainment.Paul WS Anderson
steps down as director but still contributes as writer which is very
evident as everything else seemed to improve but the dialogue got worse
lol.See it for the special effects and don&#39;t expect a brilliant
adaptation of Resident Evil 2 or a terrifying zombie flick like Dawn Of
The Dead expect to be entertained and you will be.
