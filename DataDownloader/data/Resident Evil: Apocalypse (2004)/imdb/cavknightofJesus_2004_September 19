I thought that RE:A was an absolute success and a d*mn good movie. I
thought that it was more of an action film than a horror/zombie film
and I did like the &quot;tenseness&quot; that was so evident in the first movie.
However, I thought that the plot and storyline followed the game pretty
close (I being an absolute zombie and RE fanatic both of the games and
the movies) I would have like to have seen more &quot;zombie action&quot; though
I did think that this crew did a very good job with the Nemesis
creature. Overall I give RE:A **** and I would tell anyone interested
in this type of horror to go and give it a shot....wait...I do have one
complaint....NO HEAD SHOTS!! none close enough that is...lol...no
zombies tearing flesh off of their victims...y'know what I mean.
Anyway, I liked RE:A very much and would like to see the third film in
the RE series!
