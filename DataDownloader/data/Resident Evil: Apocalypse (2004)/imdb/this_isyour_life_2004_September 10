I thought the movie was good. The action was a little frantic, but the
overall plot was well thought out. Following the storyline of the game
introducing new characters is a great idea that the director does well.
Milla and Sienna do a great job as the heroines. Mike Epps does an
excellent job providing some comedic relief. I really like the fact
that the writers made the movie for fans, and that it is something fans
of the movie and the games would enjoy watching as the story unfolds.
Perhaps you will even remember a part from the game in the movie. All
else I can really say without giving the movie away is that as long as
Milla keeps looking hot I'll see whatever they decide to do in the
future. I will look forward to a sequel if it is done as well as the
first two.
