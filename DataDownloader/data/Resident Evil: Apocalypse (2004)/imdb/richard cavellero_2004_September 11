Resident Evil Apocalypse rocks! Anyone walking out of this film and not
saying that had no business watching the movie to begin with. The
dynamite sequel features Milla Jovovich in a kick ass performance as
Alice. Picking up right where the last one left off. Racoon City has
been destroyed by the T virus and it'sa effects as it was mistakenly
let loose from the contaminated Hive. The now infamous Umbrella
Corporation quarantines the city locking a few survivors and it's
deadly inhabitants with them. Amongst the characters are game idols
Jill valentine played brilliantly by Sienna Guilroy and The mummy's
Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera. The film also features the Nemesis. if you
have no idea of what I'm referring too you have no business seeing this
film. It's definitely a high for RE fans to see their fav games done
with such justice. Sure maybe the acting and dialogue are a bit cheesy
but it's all part of a much bigger picture and I for one can't wait to
see this brilliant franchises end result.
