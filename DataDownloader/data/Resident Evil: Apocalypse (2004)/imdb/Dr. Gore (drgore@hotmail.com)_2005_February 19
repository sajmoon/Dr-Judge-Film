*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />Lethal megababe Alice, (Milla Jovovich), is back. The Hive gets
reopened for some reason. The zombies take advantage of the human's
blunder and pour out into Racoon City. Alice and another hot chick
decide to bring the war to the zombies. The rest of the movie is one
long fight scene with zombie dogs, slobbering creatures and a big
monster with a rocket launcher all wanting to waste the killer babe
squad.<br /><br />While &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; is light on plot, it is heavy on kills,
explosions and various other forms of mayhem. I definitely felt I got
my money's worth. There are really only two differences between this
movie and the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. One, this movie introduces a
new monster, the Nemesis. It's a big monster with bad teeth wearing an
overcoat and wielding a rocket launcher. The other difference is that
they added another hot woman to the zombie killing mix. Alice needed
some babe backup. Overall, I was pleased with this one. It's worth a
look.
