I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I was worried about all the
bad reviews this movie was given, but realized that most of them were
by people who judge every movie by how many Oscars it can win. This
movie will win none, and it shouldn't. What a movie like this should be
is entertaining and keeps its roots with the game. I think it
accomplished both. Also, it kept up good suspense, and had many
surprising moments. The final fight was the worst part of the movie,
but still was acceptable. Even though Alice is a made up character(in
relation to the game), I thought her presence was beneficial to the
movie. The acting was fine, and I liked Mike Epps character, even
though he wasn't vital for the plot. His comic relief was always
welcome. This movie also gave a good background of what the first movie
set up, which was good for people who haven't seen the first Resident
Evil, but was efficient enough to not waste the time of those who did
see RE1. The only thing I wished was that Marilyn Manson scored this
movie, because he did such a great job of using the music to set the
atmosphere of each scene in RE1. However, great movie. Go see it in
theaters.
