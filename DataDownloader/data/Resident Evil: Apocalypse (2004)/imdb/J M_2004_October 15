this movie was great but it had it's confusing parts. the director did
a great job of mixing horror with a lot of action. the Actors in this
movie had a hard time delivering their thought process whenever there
was talking (there wasn't much talking)they said there line with bad
acting . that was the only flaw in this spectacular movie. in the next
movie (if they make one)I think they should cast better actors. the
script was also written good the story line was great I think they
should show more Zombies though. the little girl in the movie did a
spectacular job she was cute and smart. I felt bad for the kid her
father did illegal stuff and risked her life.
