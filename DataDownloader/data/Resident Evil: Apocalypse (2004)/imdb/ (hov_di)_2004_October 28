The first resident evil movie was really good, it had a great plot, the
actors and the actress did very well and their performance was Worth
seen more than One time!!!. Besides the Awesome manuscript, was the
action at a level where a few movies can compete. When the it was
announced that a second resident evil was on it way to the cinema, were
my expectations high, but the movie full filled them completely. <br /><br />Resident Evil: apocalypse Is perhaps the greatest action movie we will
see in years. The plot in the movie was of course different from the
first one, but it was so much better than the plot from the first
movie. I was really shocked/amazed/impressed when i left the cinema and
so was my four other fellows. <br /><br />Resident evil: apocalypse contains everything a movie shall have. I
can't pinpoint anything as unnecessary or unimportant. 10
