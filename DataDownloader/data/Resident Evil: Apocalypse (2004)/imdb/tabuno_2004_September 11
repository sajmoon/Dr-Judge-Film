The sound effects, the fast paced action, the blur of violence, the
plot are provided good exposure in this sequel, sequel. This
entertaining horror-plenty of action thriller flick was an above
average horror genre with a little for everyone one who likes these
movies. There is the tender, emotional rescue, the comedic relief, the
unanticipated deaths (so to speak), and twist at the end. This movie
captures the titillating show of reveal leg, and kickass martial art
moves, the evil scientists, and strong female leads. While the movie
suffers from a few plot weaknesses, the fantasy, video nature of this
movie allows for some flexibility. The zombie-like creatures seem to
fade some in an odd illogical way (for the script's sake)...people seem
to survive by luck in some cases or die in other cases (as guess just
as in real life). Some of the movie is contrived, some some characters
obvious set up for oblivion with recourse to rational sanity. All in
all, this movie did its horror and thrills more and bigger and
whizzier. Seven out of Ten Stars.
