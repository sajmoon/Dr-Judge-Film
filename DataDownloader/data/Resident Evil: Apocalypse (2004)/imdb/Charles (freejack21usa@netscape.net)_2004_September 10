Which isn't saying much.<br /><br />But still a good fun film. A lot of fighting. It jumps straight to the
action. Not as gross as I wished, but still very good.<br /><br />The acting was good enough. A lot of twists. And even the characters
that you know are going to die, are fully fleshed out. (Which makes
them even more tastier for the zombies.) The effects were cool, and
Jill Valentine rocked. So did Milla, and a nice set up for a 3rd.<br /><br />Surprisingly good overall. I would recommend it. A lot of good action,
and laughs.<br /><br />If this movie is PG 13, I don't know how.
