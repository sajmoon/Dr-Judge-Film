First, don't go looking for a Oscar winner. It serves it's purpose and
was pretty good. I thought it was true to the description I read in the
papers: Rated-R Non-stop violence, language, some nudity. The fight
scenes weren't all that great but other than that I don't see how they
could make a much better movie or series of movies based on a video
game. I'd go see it again and I plan to get it on DVD when it comes
out. I've read a lot of negative stuff about the director but I don't
think many people could have done it much better. Stayed true to the
game's over all theme of the World Wide corporation that controls
everything and does as it wishes. I'd give it 3 out of 5 if they had a
review bar.
