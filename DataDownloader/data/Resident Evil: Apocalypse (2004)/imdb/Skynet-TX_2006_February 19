This movie is NOT Resident Evil 2. This is NOT a sequel and NOT a
prequel. It's based on the game, while the first movie is NOT really
based on it. There's no continuity. At the end of the first film the
city of Racoon is TOTALLY abandoned and ruined, during this one it's
full of people and just starts to ruin. At the end of the first film
Alice wakes up in the hospital of Racoon city, in this one she wakes up
in a lab who knows where. It's not a good film on its own because it
refers to first one and starts before the of end of that. And so on ...
If you want to see how they turned one of the games into a film, than
watch this. Otherwise, avoid.
