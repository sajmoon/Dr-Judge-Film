.... MORE!<br /><br />RE:A is a great update and addition to the RESIDENT EVIL group of
entertainment options.... The video games all ROCK! The original movie
ROCKED.... This one kind of rocks....<br /><br />The PLUSES:<br /><br />Meeting Jill Valentine... They did an EXCELLENT job of bringing the
character from 'Resident Evil:Nemesis' to the screen.<br /><br />Meeting Nemesis... Another EXCELLENT interpretation of the vg character
to the screen... looks perfect.... I just don't remember weapons.....<br /><br />Blending Alice into the cast.... also, bringing to life the other cast
members from the game series and from the original movie....<br /><br />The action is TOP NOTCH, with lots of fighting scenes and zombie
attacks....<br /><br />The MINUSES: Alice seems a bit too 'Terminator T-800' for my tastes.... <br /><br />Jill's voice just doesn't seem to match the actress/character....<br /><br />The filming and/or editing of a lot of the zombie scenes do not allow
you to look at the zombies.... it's like the only had budget for about
20 zombie extras and didn't want us to see the lack of makeup on other
non-zombie extras being used or they didn't want us to see the same
zombies in every crowd....<br /><br />The filming/editing was a bit TOO dark at times - making some of the
action easy to miss....<br /><br />Special effects - some they spent WAY too much on and others not enough
on.<br /><br />Over all - about a 7 of a movie.... worth it, but not exceptionally as
great as the first one!
