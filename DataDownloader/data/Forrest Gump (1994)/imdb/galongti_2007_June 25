I watched this film ten years ago but it is still in my mind
obviously.This is not an action or horror movies which are usually
attractive. It is just a story,but a amazing story about amazing
person.His name is Forrest Gump. He is not a normal person because he
is, well somebody assumes that,very dumb. Certainly, that is not the
main aspect of the movie. Forrest Gump make his life become a modern
fairy tale when from a disable child to the famous footballer and
soldier. In his mind,nothing important than his mother and Jenny, his
closet friend and loved girl friend.Forrest Gump never use violence to
solve problems.However, he did it one time because one stupid guy
insult Jenny.I really like his sentence, &quot;I don&#39;t know what is love,but
I love you.&quot; The lesson I took from this movie and Forres Gump
personally is we can do anything we want. Do not hesitate,whether our
decision is right or wrong,just do it.It will help us to be more
mature.I like this film very much because it is so humane
