Before I came to this site, this movie was my all-time favorite movie.
But since then I saw many movies that changed my whole perspective of
movie making, and truly many changed my life (in the way I should live
and think) - so I grow apart from Forrest. <br /><br />Before a month or so I was in class and we had a discussion about a
man&#39;s will&#39;s and boundaries. It came to me in a surprise to see on the
TV screen an example of the discussed subject - I saw Forst run. Why
did he ran? He doesn&#39;t know, he&#39;s just running - but people found
meaning to his acts and ran with him - and he changed their life&#39;s. <br /><br />I felt like crying. I feel like crying. <br /><br />&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as a truly great, deep and emotional look of life. It
tells us a story of a great life but accidentally breaks our hearts.
It&#39;s full of hope and happiness but with a lot of sadness. It may not
be the greatest film of all - But it never meant to be... It is just a
tale of a man named Forrest, Forrest Gump.
