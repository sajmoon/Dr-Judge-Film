This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. 
Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man who just happens to
make history over his life.  He makes history like inspiring Elvis's dance,
the smiley face and all sorts of stuff.  He is great playing Forrest and I
enjoyed him all the way.  Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson
were all really good as the other characters who help Forrest in his life. 
Robin Wright is also very good as Jenny, the one and only person that
Forrest loves and also gets some history in her.  I enjoyed everyone's
performance and Robert Zemeckis made himself a true gem here.  He's a great
director alone but this made him one of the best.<br /><br />Overall Tom Hanks is wonderful and everybody else does really good too. 
Robert Zemeckis did great with this and he is possibly one of the greatest
directors of all time.  This movie is possibly one of the greatest movie of
all time.  Rating 10.5 out of 10.  (Second favorite movie)
