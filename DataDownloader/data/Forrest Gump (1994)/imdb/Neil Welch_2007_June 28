2007_June 28 
Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I&#39;ll be
brief.<br /><br />As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I
positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you
are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what
obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext &quot;In America&quot;).
Sorry, it just ain&#39;t true, even in America. I&#39;m afraid to say that I
loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more
than I loathed the message.<br /><br />And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours &quot;disease
of the week&quot; performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson&#39;s performance as
a similarly afflicted character in &quot;The Hand That Rocks The Cradle&quot; -
why did that get overlooked?).<br /><br />But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask
Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks&#39;
performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its
own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is
nothing special.
