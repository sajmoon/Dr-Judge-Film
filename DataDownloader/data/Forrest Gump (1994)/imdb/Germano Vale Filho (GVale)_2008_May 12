You don&#39;t need anything but a simple character, a nice story and the
ability to make it happen to touch people&#39;s deepest feelings. Yet that
simple, Forrest Gump is loving, tender, just perfect.<br /><br />My father always told me about how much beautiful The Sound of Music
(1965) was to him, in his early childhood. I guess Forrest Gump is just
like that to me, even being a feature not played in my childhood, but
in my adolescence, just that period in time we&#39;re confused by all
emotions blooming.<br /><br />Every time I feel desperate or needing to revigorate my live, it&#39;s time
for watching again Forrest Gump.
