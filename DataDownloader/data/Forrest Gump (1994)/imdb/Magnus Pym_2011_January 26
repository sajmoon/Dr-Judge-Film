Taken by itself, this is a wonderful movie with a compelling plot,
wonderful characters played by talented actors and a balls-out
performance by Gary Sinise, who in my opinion deserved the Oscar more
than Tom Hanks. It is really an emotional roller-coaster of a movie
that people of all ages can enjoy.<br /><br />However, I&#x27;m rather conflicted about the sneaky the way the movie turns
the truth inside out in pursuit of its aims. In the world of &#x27;Forrest
Gump&#x27;, the Vietnam War was a just endeavor and its protesters were all
drugged out, cowardly, sleazy hippies who turn innocent American farm
girls into dope-dependent sluts. The social fervor of the sixties is
presented as an irrational mania, and conservative norms are
uncritically celebrated. The way this movie has been embraced by the
hard-core right wing really creeps me out.<br /><br />Still, this is one movie where the &#x27;Willing Suspension of Disbelief&#x27;
can reap big dividends.
