Forrest Gump holds a special place in my heart. My son is intellectually
disabled and I hope his life will be a full as Forrest's (without going to
war though....pass on that one!).<br /><br />The characters are all spot on. What young man hasn't been secretly in love
with a &quot;Jenny&quot; who spurned his love when it wasn't convenient but needed it
when the frivolous part of her life was over. The pop singer Prince once had
a line in a song &quot;Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to
last!&quot;.<br /><br />From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them
all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the
experience.<br /><br />10/10 for a movie with heart.<br /><br />PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!
