Forrest Gump, wow this movie is amazing and realistic and i absolutely loved
it. This movie is so amazing how they put Tom Hanks in the television
talking to John F Kennedy, cool. How the elements go through the movie is so
amazing and the movie made me cry in the end while Forrest is saying
good-bye to his Jenny, oh how sad i actually cried.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece and will never be forgotten and I think this is
one of Tom Hanks best performance of his career, good for him. The amazing
quote is so funny and makes everyone think, everyone's life is definitely a
box of chocolate. I really hope people watch this movie seriously and see
what an excellent movie this is. Please go see it and you will feel good to
be with Forrest Gump<br /><br />4 out of 4 stars a must-see masterpiece
