I&#39;m an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So
to begin with, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was not going to be my kind of movie. But
I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I
&quot;get it&quot; about this film. It&#39;s a journey through modern American
history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of
the main character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly
get hurt gets hurt. If it&#39;s a sunny day, it will start raining in this
film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic
scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant
actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him
around. There&#39;s no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.<br /><br />These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script
surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is
basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV
at its worst.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- Soap opera fans<br /><br />-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do have<br /><br />an artistic film school depth<br /><br />I&#39;ll give &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained
a consistent tone throughout. If you don&#39;t like the first ten minutes,
stop watching.
