I never knew how low the Academy could stoop when bestowing the coveted
&quot;Best picture&quot; award when it chose to do so for the movie, Forrest
Gump. It is a movie celebrating mental retardation and toss in some
Frank Capra of &quot;Its a wonderful life&quot; fame and the mantra, &quot;you&#39;re
never a failure if you have friends&quot; and you get the fabulously
contrived piece of cinematic drivel that is, Forrest Gump. This film is
rarely talked about these days, matter of fact, you never hear it
mentioned AT ALL. It&#39;s become the most forgotten &quot;Best Film&quot; Hollywood
has ever produced! Sort of ironic when you think about it because a
best film award should entitle a movie to some longevity on the shelf.
But no. This crappy piece of celluloid demonstrates more the short term
memories of the American people as they the were the ones who seem to
identify most with the character of Forrest Gump. This intellectually
stunted individual is celebrated as the pure embodiment of American
&quot;innocence.&quot; How pathetic! You have been warned. Please, don&#39;t support
movies of this ilk. It belittles your claim to being a lover of cinema
when you love such trash.
