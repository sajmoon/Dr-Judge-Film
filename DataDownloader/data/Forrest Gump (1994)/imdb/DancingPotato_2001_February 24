When I first saw this movie, I wasn't really old enough to appreciate it.
Since then I thin I've seen it three times, and it was just as amazing each
and every time.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump, a simple man. Forrest Gump is not stupid. He's
simple. At a very young age, Forrest had trouble walking so his mother
(Sally Field) had him get braces for his legs. Then he met jenny, the blond
little girl that would let him sit with her. All throughout his life,
Forrest will chase Jenny. Generally unbeknownst to him, Forrest becomes part
of history. He fights in the Vietnam war. He meets a bunch of presidents. He
meets Elvis. He uncovers the Watergate mystery. He meets characters like
Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Capitain Dan (Gary Sinise). All this is told
mostly throughout flashbacks as Forrest tells his life to people as he sits
on a bench, waiting for a bus. Tom Hanks brings a sweetness to the character
of Forrest Gump that has never been achieved this well before. Gary Sinise,
Robin Wright, Sally Field and Mykelti Williamson bring help to this film,
but it really is about Forrest. You feel for this man like you've never felt
before for such a simple character. You follow him through his life, and you
enjoy it.<br /><br />I like everything about this movie. Through the great flashbacks, you get to
live American history, and not just a small part. All of it. The narrative
here is rich and you can never get enough. This movie clocks in at more than
two and half hours, but it's barely too long. Only near the end do you feel
like you're wasting your time. The other problem is that some events are
moralistic bordering on the chick-flick. Yet there are so many nice touches,
so many engaging performances that you'll let yourself get sucked in. Life
is like a box of chocolates. If you don't do something with it, it'll melt
away. 9/10
