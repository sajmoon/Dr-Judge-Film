I saw Forrest Gump when I was around eight years old, and to tell you
the truth, it was boring to me then. Now I am old enough to understand
how the director uses symbolism to represent how anyone, in this case a
young man with a mental illness, can change the world by following his
heart. That sounds cheesy, but it is very much true. Forrest Gump,
beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks, is extremely naive, yet maybe that
is why he withdraws affection from any audience (that can comprehend
basic symbolism, of course, a huge part in this movie's nature.) as you
watch his amazing life unfold. I recommend this movie to anyone in the
mood for a sad, moving, and intellectual movie. Forrest Gump truly
deserves to be called a 'classic'.
