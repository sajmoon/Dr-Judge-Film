Forrest Gump could have been better, but it's good enough.<br /><br />In the first half hour I find the screenplay's a bit weak but then I get
carried away by Zemeckis' creativity in bringing historical icons into
Gump's simplicity. The music and the background are fantastic but somehow
the acting from the casts don't impress me as much as they should.
Nevertheless, overall it's the feel-good film of the year.<br /><br />
