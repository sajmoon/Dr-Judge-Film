<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a classic example of the sanctimonious garbage that people
are willing to swallow simply because Tom Hanks is involved.  If the film
had a more a satiric perspective maybe I could appreciate it.<br /><br />It begins appallingly and maniputively with a stereotypically Southern
Sally
Field and her idiot son 'FAUST' battling through tough times and meeting a
whole lot of important people that real people like us will never ever
meet.
Elvis is one that is easily recalled.
Through the remainder of the film we are supposed to endure one
implausibility after another: Forrest meets the president, Forrest becomes
a
ping pong champion, Forrest becomes a Vietnam vet and Forrest discovers a
cure for cancer! (well maybe that scene doesnt happen but i wouldnt be
surprised if it was cut just prior to release).
While people were going ga-ga at the way Forrest floats through life like
a
feather (a pathetic symbol that is ridiculously used in the film), i was
seriously being sick.<br /><br />The central performance of Hanks is one that is truly embarrassing he is
stiff, lifeless and codescending.  It seems as though Hanks' was studying
children to breath life into Forrest, if this is so maybe he should put
himself on their level rather than looking down at them as dribbling, pre
pubescent morons. The remainder of the cast similarly sleepwalk through
the
one dimensional roles they are presented with,  only Gary Sinise deserves
to
garner any praise here.  The lines that spew forth from the characters'
mouths were initially praised as incisive observations about our lives -
WHAT!!!   They are dopey, uninventive and quite frankly wrong.  &quot;life is
like a box of chocolates- you never know what youre gonna get&quot; - yes you
do
they are pictured on the back of the box.<br /><br />I would rather have a vital organ removed than recommend this dross to
anyone over the age of five!
