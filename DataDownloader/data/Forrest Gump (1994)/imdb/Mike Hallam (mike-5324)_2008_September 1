I first saw this at the cinema when it was first released. It was
wonderful then and only seems to get better with time. Such a lovely
film that changes you forever, and can teach everyone something. <br /><br />Whilst the plot is extraordinary and cover so many things that Forest
does in his lifetime, it is somehow completely believable they way its
presented; you find yourself thinking about history and the topics
covered during the film and still a few days after.<br /><br />Tom Hanks&#39; best performance and wonderful supporting cast too. Great
Music Soundtrack - Although a big winner I still feel this film didn&#39;t
win nearly enough Academy Awards. another truly magical film from
Robert Zemeckis. I hate people who lick director ass, but this dude
Zemeckis has an amazing talent to really put you there and make you
feel it by tapping into your childlike emotions and senses. Like in
Castaway or Back to the Future, always something anyone can watch and
feel in one way or another.<br /><br />The kind of film that comes along a few times in a whole lifetime, I
feel it is underrated if anything,; as I guess these days, liking
something lovely and heart-warming is no longer cool.<br /><br />This film will still be considered superb long after titles like The
Matrix and Spiderman/Batman films are being laughed at. Makes everyone
laugh &amp; cry, the sort of film that you want to show your kids one day.
