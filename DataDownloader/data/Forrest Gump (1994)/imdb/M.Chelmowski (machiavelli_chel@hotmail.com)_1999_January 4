1999_January 4 

I found this an entertaining movie to watch, nothing more, nothing less. I
have one major reason for being negative about this film: it portrays a man
who is able to attain the 'American Dream' without any intelligence. However
much we can admire him for that, I'm afraid that the message being sent out
is that you don't need education or smarts and that everything will come to
you as if laid by a golden goose. Surely this is not what the movie makers
intended but that's the way it came across on me.<br /><br />Besides that I must say that Tom Hanks does an excellent acting job, and for
that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a
classic.
