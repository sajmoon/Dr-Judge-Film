&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much
praise. As someone who genuinely loves this film, I am dumbfounded by
those
who hate it. But time after time, when a film receives high praise from a
great number of people, it leaves high expectations for those who haven't
seen it. The result is often disappointment.<br /><br />Some people object to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the
involvement of Forrest in some of America's pivotal moments in history is
not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument I've heard is the
fact
that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of
success that Forrest does. They've missed out on a truly charming,
endearing
fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a
simple one at that. And the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the
message behind it is so straightforward. &quot;Stupid is as stupid
does&quot;.<br /><br />Forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no
fault found in him. It's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure,
and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him,
when
he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart
breaks, ours breaks also.<br /><br />I can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the
scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the
bullies on bicycles, gets me every time. Every single time. I've watched
this film more times than I care to count, as I feel as though I should be
watching something I've never seen before. But this film just makes me
feel
good, and I'll no doubt watch it again.<br /><br />Now you see, I can't help but praise this film, and in a way I'm probably
ruining it for someone else. My sister blames me for ruining it for her.
It's not easy to forget what everyone's said, and the awards it has won.
But
if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and
open your mind to a very charming film.
