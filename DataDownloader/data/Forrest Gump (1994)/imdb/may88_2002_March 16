I adored this movie when it originally came out. Then I saw it too many
times and I started to dislike it. Then I saw &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;
and
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and I wondered how those movies lost to this one on Oscar
night. I started to hate it, even. 7 years went past, and I hadn't watched
this movie once. But, Saturday afternoon tv is dull. There was nothing on,
except &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. So I decided to watch it, after all it had been 7
years. It was very easy to get caught up in the movie. No matter what
anyone
says now, Tom Hanks is nothing less then perfect as the dim witted Forrest
Gump. The facial expressions he takes when he's trying to be sly, when
he's
proud of himself, when he's sad - its watching a fine actor at his best.
Robin Wright it wonderful as the ever elusive Jenny; as is Gary Sinise as
the angry but loyal Ltn. Dan. Mykelti Williamson is heartbreakingly
memorable as Forrest's best good friend Bubba. It's fun to watch Forrest
make his mark on history, yet be uneffected and even naive about his fame
and fortune. There's no doubt in my mind anymore as to why I loved this
movie, why everyone loved this movie. Sometimes, you have to be prodded
into
remembering why you loved something. I think I'll pay attention to movies
on
TV on Saturday afternoons more often; maybe I'll rediscover something else
I
forgot.
