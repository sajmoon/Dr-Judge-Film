This is one of those amazing movies that will touch you way down deep
where
it counts. My best advice would be to send everyone out of the house,
unplug
the phone, grab a drink and a bag if chips, and watch this one without
distraction, from beginning to end. This is also a good drama for those
who
would normally avoid drama on the video store shelf.. Go on, guys, it's
worth it!
