Story: Forrest Gump is not very smart. He is just little simple man.
Forrest just collision in important moment and meet people USA history
from 1950s to 1980s. And he fall in love girl named Jenny in his first
ride for school. In time Forrest graduate school playing football and
goes to Vietham. He become war hero. He just loves run lot...<br /><br />My Review: Forrest Gump is one of best movies ever made in Hollywood.
It's have kind of special warm &amp; emotion feeling in whole movie. I have
watched this movie over 30 times and till watched again again. Truly
Tom Hanks deserve Oscar this remarkable role, which is his till best
role. ILM did good job making clip which Forrest Gump meet like JFK or
John Lennon...
