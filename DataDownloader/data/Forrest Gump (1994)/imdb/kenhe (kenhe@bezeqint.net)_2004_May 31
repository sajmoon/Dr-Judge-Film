I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the
beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence
and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to
retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As
a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could
of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump
endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending
of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so
perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five
years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history
only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well
known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark
that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.
