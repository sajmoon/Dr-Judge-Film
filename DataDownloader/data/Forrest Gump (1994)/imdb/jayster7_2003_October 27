I loved this movie.  While I love movies that really make me think and do
so
in interesting ways, I'm still a kid at heart.  I love romance, I love
human
kindness, and I love the thought of people doing things out of &quot;goodness&quot;,
not self interest.<br /><br />Forrest Gump doesn't have a twist ending, it doesn't have explosions, it
doesn't have car chases, it doesn't have sexy actors, and it doesn't
explore
the depths our imaginations.  The movie, like Forrest himself, is simple.
Very simple.  Also like Forrest's life though, the movie's simplisticness
leaves you to marvel at how much good can come from it.<br /><br />I laughed repeatedly.  I cried hard at different points - some out of
sadness, but most out of pure joy.  If I had been &quot;thinking&quot; more about
the
plot, the characters, etc, I probably would not have been able to deeply
feel such basic emotions.  But because the movie, story, and characters
are
so simple, these often overlooked emotions were able to be enjoyed at such
a
pure level.<br /><br />Highly recommended - just don't expect anything deep or
thought-provoking...
looking for it will definitely detract from the experience.  Enjoy Forrest
and enjoy his life &quot;story&quot;.
