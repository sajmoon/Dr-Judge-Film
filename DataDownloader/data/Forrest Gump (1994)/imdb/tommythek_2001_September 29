2001_September 29 

Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise
(Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest
Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world
gone crazy.<br /><br />In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched &quot;Forrest
Gump&quot; and that she &quot;loved that movie.&quot; Although it had been some seven years
since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once
&quot;loved that movie.&quot; When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the
urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest
Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity
and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity
that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been
assuaged.<br /><br />By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; At least
once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a
drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all
of those things, all in one movie. &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; when and as you are
watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as
you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that
somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby
-- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness
follows.<br /><br />My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy
gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just
as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has
become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You
want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl!
Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL
want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always
love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his
unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so
deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ...
&quot;HALLELUJAH!!!&quot; Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the
father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to
yourself, &quot;Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should
be!&quot;<br /><br />And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even
Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is
unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest &quot;touches&quot;
everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He
just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless
world.<br /><br />I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;
and that she &quot;loved that movie.&quot; She spurred me to watch it once again.
Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to
my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is
a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens
may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru
the evils that these evil men do. Peace and love to you, Forrest.
