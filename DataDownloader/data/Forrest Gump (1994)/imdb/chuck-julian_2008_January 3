The relationship between Forrest and Jenny strikes a cord with me
because it is a relationship between a guy who feels inadequate and the
girl of his dreams. Unfortunately for most guys, that first girl he
falls for is often not in love with him. She likes him, but does not
love him. In that situation, most guys feel inadequate, unable to feel
worthy of that girl and yet are unwilling to just let it go. Forrest
loves Jenny. He tries to prove that to her and do the best he can with
what he has got. This is a story about that search for love and
approval. A story where guys can identify with that search, put
themselves in Forrest&#39;s place, and long to be with Jenny. Along the
way, Forrest passes through the history of America from the 50&#39;s on to
the 90&#39;s and plays a part in that history.
