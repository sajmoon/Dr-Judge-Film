Not one to have quite made a classic (though the first &quot;Back to the
Future&quot; film and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&quot; come close), Robert
Zemeckis never makes less than interesting work. (I have a particular
weakness/affinity for it). In some senses, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; may be his
magnum opus - if only because it showcases all of Zemeckis' nuances and
idiosyncrasies whilst also somewhat disguising and flaunting its own
off-beatedness in a fairly linear - albeit curious - narrative. How do
you criticise a film like this? For every negative thrown at Gump, I've
seen the film produce a reasonable rebuttal in my own mind. It seems to
defy criticism altogether. This unique quality of Gump stems from its
refusal to completely yield to its conflicting tonalities and messages.
Is it satire, drama or something else? Does it favour the American
Dream, slander it or alternatively embrace and shy away from it? Does
it champion Forrest's virtuosity, outright demean it or look
impartially at it? Do these labels and divides exist at all - is the
film merely disinterested in these things or maybe trying to suggest
that we shouldn't be bothered and stop dealing in labels and monikers?
Many questions - few answers.<br /><br />Hanks' performance embodies the film. It's pleasant, slick and
affecting - yet was it really more Oscar worthy (he won, the others
didn't) than Gary Sinise's in the same film or Samuel Jackson's in
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;? Was the film as a whole deserving of &quot;Best Picture&quot;?
Are you sick of reading questions? It's all so damn hard to pin this
work to one thing. The film offers itself up for criticism in a number
of areas - in its flagrant sentimentality, in its gimmicky &quot;Forrest
interacting with famous people&quot; sequences, in its vast extravagancies
(e.g. any time Forrest runs and inevitably performs a remarkable feat)
- but all these things seem woven into a greater fabric that spins and
toys with them and its pure protagonist, like the wind spinning and
toying with the pure white feather and contriving it to land at his
feet, not to mention the viewer, in a knowing and powerful manner.
Truly, there is nothing quite like &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; - nor is there
anything like Forrest Gump. Perhaps that is at the root of it all. The
film is possibly nothing more than a celebration of individuality. What
makes it so profound and transcendental is that the individual of
Forrest gives us a unique look at varied and turbulent American
history, and more broadly, even more varied and turbulent human
experience. We should probably be thankful for that.<br /><br />I'm sorry for the slightly unconventional review, but as I've said and
implied all over, it's an unconventional film and needs to be handled
as such. We can all look tough picking up broken glass with Kevlar
gloves; when the sharp diamond-like edges can't get to our skin so
easily. We can all look good destroying a film with sweeping words;
when we've &quot;gloved&quot; ourselves away from its smaller details. But how
many of us can dispense with the gloves, picking up broken piece after
broken piece, constantly risking exposure to the finer qualities of the
glass - glass that may cut us? How many of us can dispense with our
harsh words, patiently resolving to consider and explore the finer
textures of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; - a film that may be saying nothing of
interest and reward our patience by &quot;cutting&quot; us? It's a tough one.
This review has been non-committal. So is the film. See it. Feel it.
Live it.
