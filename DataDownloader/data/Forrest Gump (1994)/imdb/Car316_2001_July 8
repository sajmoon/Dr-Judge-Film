Forrest Gump is simply a &quot;Either you Buy it, or you don't&quot; movie. I bought
it, because the movie is just so endlessly charming to me. Every scene is
magical. And it just gets better and better as it goes along. The movie has
everything, drama, comedy, adventure, war, etc. The soundtrack is great. Tom
Hanks is magnificent also. Overall, Forrest Gump is endlessly charming and
one of my  personal favorite movies. **** (out of four)
