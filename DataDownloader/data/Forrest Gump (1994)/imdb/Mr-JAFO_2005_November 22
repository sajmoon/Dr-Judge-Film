I must confess that the 2 first times I saw this movie (its theatrical
release and its 1st television issue), I loved, even adored, this
movie. But then, looking back more calmly, I started thinking: what
does this movie really have? A mix of historical situations (in
chronological order, of course), a lot of songs (especially from the
1960s &amp; 1970s), an incredibly lucky idiot whose strange quote &quot;life is
like a chocolate box&quot; entered cinematic pop culture and, behind it all,
an irresponsible depiction of points of view (typicall from the 1990s).
This movie was actually the perfect excuse to play a ton of oldies
(remixed and remastered to fit the strange 1990s likes), use innovative
technology (especially digital) to place this boy everywhere and
revisit recent history. (Almost) nothing more, and nothing less.
