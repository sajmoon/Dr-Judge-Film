I will start off, this film is truly captivating. The character of
Forrest Gump is so well thought of. It is a symbol for hope. The
performance done by Tom Hanks is one of the best I have seen. First
off, it gets a lot of hate around here, but the truth is, only a great
actor could pull it off.Tom Hanks did amazing as the mentally
challenged man. The way the film starts off, it is sort of a &#39;fairy
tale&#39;. Yes, it seems a bit theatrical at times, but this is the whole
tone of the film. the film is trying to teach us more. the film is
trying to pull the audience in an emotional way, and let me tell you,
it does. We can really feel for every single character. The mom tries
to do what every other mom tries to do these days. She is trying to
raise her child the best way possible, in all means trying to keep him
away from the cruelty of the world. This film represents life in a sort
of light and innocent way, mainly because it is told from Forrest&#39;s
point of view. The other characters, Forrest&#39;s friends that interwine
in his life, Bubba and Lt. Dave, are all very well-rounded. They
represent other symbols. The performance given by Gary Sinise is
perfect. he perfectly captures his character&#39;s struggles. He is a very
confused and &#39;bad&#39; character in a way, but the way Forrest changes him
and gives him hope is truly inspiring. The other character who I also
think is sort of dark in a way, is Jenny. Jenny represents a lot of
people these days. No, she is not &#39;evil&#39;, but like a lot of people
these days, she is lost and doesn&#39;t know who she really is or what she
really wants to do. her journey throughout the film is also very
developed, and the actress playing her, Robin Writh Penn did a great
job. Sally Field, of course, is great and wimsy and perfect in her
performance.<br /><br />What is amazing in this film is not only the unforgettable characters
and the amazing screenplay, but also the amazing cinematography and
sets. The setting designs are so well put together, yes, they look very
realistic, they are. It fits well with the tone of the film. The
direction is also amazing. It really gives us thought to the
characters, as does the pace of the wonderful film editing. The music
scores used are simply fantastic, as they also represent the whole
feeling of the film.<br /><br />At the end of the film, I found myself overly emotional at all the
scenes. Not only because of the well put ending, but because I just
remembered the whole journey Forrest Gump had. You simply cannot be in
anything but simple &#39;awe&#39; over the film. You realize how much you care
about all these situations and characters. At the end of the day, this
film is what every film should be. Give us a little bit of unfamiliar
realistic life lessons, give us the truth in a not so disturbing way,
but also simply gives us hope and uplift the audience(Forrest Gump&#39;s
run across American is one of the best single moments in cinema
history). This film is simple perfect, and it really surprised me.
Perfect film-making.
