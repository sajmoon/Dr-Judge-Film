Forrest Gump is one of those movies where you want to jump through the
screen and give the helpless a big hug and help them along life's way.  Tom
Hanks did a beautiful job as Forrest Gump.  I don't think they could have
chosen a better person for the part.  Mykelti Williamson (Benjamin 'Bubba'
Bufford-Blue) was superb and very believable.  For months after this movie,
the kids were going around the house trying to think up new 'shrimp'
recipes!  Robin Wright (Jenny) was really good.  Her character was one that
you wanted to love yet hate, but not in a bad way.  Forrest loved Jenny so
very much and only when she REALLY needs him, she turns to him in the
biggest way.  <br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.  It is fun, loving,
sensitive and amazing all at the same time.  I gave it a 10!!!
