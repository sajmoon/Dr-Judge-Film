at its best. When blockbusters work they do so through creating an
alternate universe near enough to find our emotions while effecting
magical art, beauty and experience. Forrest Gump is a shining example
of that clarity. Hanks&#39; performance is so natural that no wheels can
been seen turning, astonishing when compared to Rain Man, the several
iterations of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, and a myriad other movies where low IQ
individuals are portrayed. Hanks brings to Gump dignity and
individuality that allows us to love him without sympathy for his
condition. All the supporting actors play off this lead wonderfully,
without exception. The result is a fantasy as heartfelt as any in my
experience. A truly wonderful film.
