There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig
Forrest Gump, and those who don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t. If &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is truly
viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America
is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not
even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental
contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes,
mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously
made for the same audience that likes &#x22;Sleepless in Seattle&#x22; and &#x22;Lucky
You&#x22;.<br /><br />Certainly, I don&#x27;t have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main
character from which to tell a story. (&#x22;Rain Man&#x22;, a similar idea, is a
far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of &#x22;Gump&#x22;.)
I will concede Hanks&#x27; portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant,
and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But
was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best
Writing? Is this film really in the same league as &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;,
&#x22;Ghandhi&#x22;, &#x22;The Hurt Locker&#x22;, and &#x22;Platoon&#x22;? I don&#x27;t think so. Gump&#x27;s
episodic series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than
contrived farce. Instead of telling a true human story, such as &#x22;Rain
Man&#x22;, about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the
filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most
ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical
nature of the entire story, I think &#x22;Gump&#x22; does a disservice to those
with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so
inadvertently. &#x22;Rain Man&#x22; I think achieves quite the opposite.<br /><br />So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening
sequence when young Forrest&#x27;s legs are in braces and, inspired by the
&#x22;girl next door&#x22;, he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his
braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine
something that rings of a bad &#x22;Saturday Evening Post&#x22; illustration from
the 1950&#x27;s. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite
so contrived. Of course the &#x22;running theme&#x22; will recur toward the end
of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he&#x27;s drafted
into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than
anyone in training. He&#x27;s a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?<br /><br />During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the
most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary
college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John
F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on
the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings
into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless &#x22;run&#x22;
where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is
realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow.
Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the
Academy Awards. It&#x27;s a wonder the filmmakers didn&#x27;t have him take the
next logical step and run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic
character from &#x22;Rain Man&#x22; played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his
running mate.<br /><br />The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and
his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other
standout talent of the film. Gump&#x27;s tour of duty and his relationship
with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put
together. I think it would have been far more interesting and
insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight
in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made
me say to myself, &#x22;Oh come on...&#x22; And I liked aspects of Gump&#x27;s
relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather
than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump
reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.<br /><br />The recurring theme of &#x22;Gump&#x22; is &#x22;life was like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you&#x27;re gonna get.&#x22;. As I have never liked most of
the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones),
I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of &#x22;Forrest
Gump&#x22;. I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I
want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more
realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever
wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to
make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that
you know exactly what you&#x27;re going to get and that&#x27;s why I avoid them.
