When they ask me what is the film that made me cry, I answer the only one is
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Why? Because the story of this unlucky man (even if he gets
famous), his love for his Jenny, who just considers him as a friend, this
was very interesting. Moreover, you know, many people die in this film, and
Tom Hanks's incredible skills of actor make me feel his sadness and his
thoughts. When he finds out he has a son, that moves me a lot. I mean, the
vote I give to this film is 10.
