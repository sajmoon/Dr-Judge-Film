1999_March 13 

I've seen a great many movies, but when I saw &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, I was
delighted.  I don't own it--I don't want to see it more than the two times
I've seen it already, but this film was a valuable experience for
me.<br /><br />It wasn't the best film of 1994 (that would be &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;), the best
directed (&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;), or even the best written (&quot;Pulp...&quot;,
&quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;), but there hasn't been a whole lot of movies
that have been as emotionally rich or powerful as this one.  Robert Zemeckis
has the power to exhaust me, whether it's my emotions (&quot;Contact&quot;, this
film), my visual cortex (&quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;), or my funny
bone (&quot;Used Cars&quot;).  His screenplay is responsible for anything positive
that came out of Steven Spielberg's 1979 flop &quot;1941&quot;, (except for that
astonishing dance sequence).  Here he tops his past films and screenplays
and has not done quite as good since then.<br /><br />I'll be honest:  sentimentality has its proper place and time, and must be
done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb
with awe.<br /><br />Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians
were robbed blind, but let's be real, folks:  they're Academy Awards.  It's
a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just
sit back and enjoy them.  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; wouldn't get any prizes from me,
for the simple reason that any category would be won by another film.  But
an Oscar?  Sure, what the heck.
