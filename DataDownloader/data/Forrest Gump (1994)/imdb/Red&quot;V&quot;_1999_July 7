If you liked &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; PLEASE see two films with similar themes but
which are far more profound:<br /><br />&quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; by Akira Kurosawa.  It's the only Kurosawa film on the
Vatican Top 45 film list; it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1976;
the main character is purportedly the basis for Yoda in the &quot;Star Wars&quot;
saga.<br /><br />&quot;Being There&quot; with Peter Sellers.  As funny as it is
touching.<br /><br />If you see these films, you'll be a better person for it.<br /><br />
