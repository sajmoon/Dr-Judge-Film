He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest
Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by
portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest
Gump.It is also Tom Hanks&#39; second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar
which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer
Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks&#39; performance is
just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film
of Tom Hanks&#39; career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama
in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The
Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger
Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic
are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for
an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti
Williamson as Forrest&#39;s best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford&quot;Bubba&quot;
Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of
thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film
Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best
Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one
masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long
time.Bravo!
