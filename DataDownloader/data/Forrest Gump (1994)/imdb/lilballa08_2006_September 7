At the beginning of the movie we see Tom Hanks about to kiss a girl for
the first time before his tiny weiner is exposed. In this movie, Tom
Hanks does pointless, stupid things, then reacts with screaming,
Hitler-like tantrums whenever his own actions start to boomerang and
hit him in the behind.<br /><br />Since his first appearance on TV, Hanks forced his sick sense of humor
onto the poor unsuspecting audience. Is this what you call
entertainment? Do comedians not have any obligations to the public? How
are Hanks&#39;s so called entertainment pieces helping any of us be a
better person? I find it hard to answer these questions.<br /><br />On a related note, I find Hanks incredibly ugly and can hardly bear to
watch him on screen let alone enjoy his &quot;work&quot;. Besides, as he plays
the same role in every movie with the same old &quot;jokes&quot; rewinding over
and over again, watching one of his movies is just enough to guess the
others.<br /><br />Before I wrote this comment, I watched additional Hanks movies, might I
add, with disgust. And I confirmed my diagnosis: Stay away from Hanks
movies.
