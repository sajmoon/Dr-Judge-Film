Forrest Gump is the best movie. It has a great story, a lot of attention
to
details and strong characters. This movie always brings tears into my
eyes.
Has a very strong sensibility and great landscapes in the end. It also
shows
us that we can do anything, we just have to follow our way. You have to
see
it to appreciate it. It's simply the best.
