Well. When Tom Hanks is acting there is no doubt&#39;s that the production
will be a box office hit. He is a true prodigy of our time. Forrest
Gump can never be told; it has to be seen in order to appreciate this
masterpiece. This movie never ages, it really gives us hope and seeing
this really makes us think what it would have been like, if the whole
world had people like Forrest. Hanks have portrayed the protagonist in
his usual brilliant way. Since thousands of reviews have already been
given I will not go into details; Forrest Gump can be recommended for
any one who likes watching movie with a riveting theme.<br /><br />Forrest Gump will always remain as a true achievement in Movie Making.
