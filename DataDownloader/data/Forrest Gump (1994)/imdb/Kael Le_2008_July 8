Forrest Gump is one of the most amazing movies I&#39;ve ever seen. Yes, the
events are highly improbable, but that only makes the movie more
memorable. I can&#39;t help but smile when I think about Forrest
accomplishing all those things that, individually, would be the
pinnacle of any normal person&#39;s life.<br /><br />The haters on this site need to calm down. FG isn&#39;t bashing on
education or intelligence or anti-war thinking (it does the opposite,
imo) or independent thinking (Jenny struggled b/c she was abused as a
child, not b/c she was a rebel). Fact is, education and intelligence
don&#39;t guarantee happiness or success. Forrest is compassionate,
hard-working and is surrounded by people who care very much for his
wellbeing. That ultimately, is the more valuable than any degree or IQ
score. Sounds very true to me.
