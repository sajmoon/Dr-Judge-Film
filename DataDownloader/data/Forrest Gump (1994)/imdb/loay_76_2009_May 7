This is really the best movie I had ever seen in my whole life..
incredible .. stunning .. magnificent and sensitive ..<br /><br />I saw this movie for the first time when I was in the university in the
middle of the 90s and I was really amazed of the great performance by
Tom Hanks and the great motion and effects and screenplay by the genius
Robert Zemics ..<br /><br />The movie talks about the history of Forrest Gump .. a low IQed kid who
could live and amazingly succeed in the life with his own self and with
his pure soul and simple mind ..<br /><br />Forrest lived really great historical events in the American history
such like: The end of the American era of Racism against the blacks,
Kennedy&#x27;s rise and assassination, The cold war, The 1st man on the
moon, The American failure in Vietnam, the era of the Heapies and
punks, Watergate and the resign of Nixon, the failed assassination
trial on Regan .. He met a lot of important key characters (Which were
presented live and in complete interaction with Forrest Gump by the
Genius effects and mixing by Zemics) like: Elvis Presley, John F.
Kennedy, John Lennon, Johnson and Nixon ..<br /><br />All his life was full of surprises and hits of golden touches of luck
.. he went to Vietnam and was the only survivor of his unit, he became
a millionaire and the owner of a great shrimp investment enterprise and
a famous personality but he has never changed or skipped his innocent
dreams of principals ..<br /><br />His world was limited in his mom (Sally Field), His only love in life
Jenny (Robin Penn), His unit Lt. in Vietnam and later his friend and
partner Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise), His only friend and inspirer
Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and with these characters he was living his
dreams and whole life .. a life of complete innocence and purity ..<br /><br />A Genius look from Robert Zemics was the flying white feather .. A
feather that is flying and wandering in the air .. and is motioned only
by the force of the air breezes .. this represent the life and nature
of Forrest Gump .. to live the life with its currents and incidents and
to be able to survive and take it simply in each condition ..<br /><br />Really this was the best ever role performed by Tom Hanks which was
REALLY great and magnificent .. also the role of Gary Sinise was great
.. I almost believed that his legs were really cut off !! The life
through Forrest Gump&#x27;s eyes are really different .. simpler .. nicer
and brighter ..<br /><br />Thanks Tommy!! *** Lo&#x27;ay
