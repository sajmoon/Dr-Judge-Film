I really believe that this is a fantastic film!! This is an example
when you get wonderful film making and a wonderful cast! This
absolutely has to be one of the best films of the last two decades.
Forrest Gump had a lot of glory in its own right as Tom Hanks played
the character perfectly. There are so many memorable lines in this
film, and so many great scenes. This story goes along perfectly as well
as its cast. Again this film was made by an awesome director Robert
Zemeckis who has made many great films. Hanks really does the job right
as Gump who really struggles through live, but his girlfriend was right
there to support him. All the best to the actors, and everyone involved
in this film as it did so well in its own right.<br /><br />It really amazes me that for three years this film had totally ruled
the box office up until 1997. It was then in 97 when Titantic came out.
After Titanic came out it was shattering records within only a few
days. Forrest Gump which had made the most money like ever at the box
office with over 300 billion dollars!!! Titanic at the end of its time
shattered that by hitting over 600 billion dollars!!! As both movies
are amazing in their own rights, Forrest Gump looks like nothing when
you see how much Titanic raised. Honestly I would watch this film any
day, as I really could care less about Titanic. How both these films
did so well is awesome because they have great stories to them and they
consist of well known actors who fit their roles perfectly. The
directors and production crews do a superb job overall. As we all know
these movies take so long to make, but it is so worth the time and the
money.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a great film and there&#39;s no reason why it didn&#39;t win
awards. Also, its here enlisted in the 250 films list. We can all see
why this is such a great film to have in your collection. Say what you
want, but I just can&#39;t believe that Titanic brought so much more money
in. Its hard for me to see why titanic literally &#39;pulled&#39; in so much
more than this great film. There are reasons why any of these films are
so great. Thanks. Give me comments.
