A feather drifts softly through the air. It doesn't know where it's
going or what will happen. It just knows that it is drifting to its
next destination. That destination is a man waiting for a bus: Forrest
Gump. Forrest picks up the feather and puts it in his favourite picture
book. The movie has begun. We learn Forrest Gump's entire life story.
Despite his IQ of 75, he achieves greatness in the world.<br /><br />This may sound like the start of a sappy film, but it isn't. Forrest
Gump grabs you and takes you on an incredible journey. Around every
corner there is a new surprise. Some are comical, other extremely
dramatical. But every minute of the film is interesting.<br /><br />Tom Hanks did an outstanding job as Forrest Gump. The supporting cast
were amazing as well, especially Gary Sinise. But this is not the best
thing about the film: the story is. The story writers have managed to
create a story of pure beauty. <br /><br />Forrest Gump is an extremely fragile, beautiful film. I have seen this
film five times now and it still makes me cry in the end. A truly
amazing movie.
