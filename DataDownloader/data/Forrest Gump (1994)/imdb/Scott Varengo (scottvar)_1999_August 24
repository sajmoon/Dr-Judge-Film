To say Forrest Gump is a good movie is as a gross an understatement as one
could muster. The telling of the story through Forrest's eyes, the gradual
progression through his life, the remarkable circumstances that make up
that
life, all combine to make for one of the most enjoyable motion picture
experiences in the history of film.
