I always feel I am watching something magical when I watch &quot;Forest Gump&quot;. It
is more than Tom Hanks amazing performance. It is the script, the special
effects, the supporting cast and the great movie score and music of the
film. Maybe we need people like Forest Gump in the world. My only regret is
that this movie came out the same year as another classic, &quot;The Shawshank
Redemption&quot;. That is my only regret- that &quot;Forest Gump&quot; took most of the
major awards at the Academy Awards that year. Both deserved Best picture and
both are gifts to the world of entertainment.
