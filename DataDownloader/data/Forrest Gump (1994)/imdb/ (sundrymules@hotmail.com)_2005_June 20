This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and
profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like
others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never
heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read
the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people
preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards
gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do
what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the
end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having
expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So
he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the
time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains
to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our
problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which
ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We
love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the
moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is
predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is
something to mull over for a long time.
