Just watched again last Sunday.  I really didn't want to, because I find
the
film somewhat melancholy, but my girlfriend insisted.  Don't like movies
that deal with death and loss all that much.<br /><br />I see a lot of differing opinions about this movie that it was about
stupid
people from the south, that it's a morality play, that it shows that
anyone
can succeed.<br /><br />I really don' think that the director wanted to have such a heavy handed
obvious movie at all. This movie is like a painting, not a linear story.
It
was not about the South, Forest Gump, or Vietnam.  It was about life!
There
were parts of it that were silly, made me laugh, and yeah, tear up (when
his
mother was sick and dying).<br /><br />So, like every film ever made it has it's flaws and is imperfect.  It will
work with some people and not with others.  But I found it to have
moments,
scenes of mesmerizing beauty that really got to a part of the human soul
that a few movies try, but fail to reach.
