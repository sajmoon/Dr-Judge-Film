This is an intriguing social satire in the guise of a quirky
comedy-drama. Tom Hanks is good but his performance wasn&#39;t award
worthy. The film takes a (MINOR SPOILERS) conservative view of American
politics but it is deeper than its critics suggest. In fact, the film
pokes fun at the average person who goes through life blissfully
unaware of the importance of events happening around him/her. The
Special Effects are effective and the period detail impeccable. There
is an affecting moment earlier in the picture which brought tears to my
eyes. Despite its over length and dull mid-section, its worth watching.<br /><br />Overall 7/10
