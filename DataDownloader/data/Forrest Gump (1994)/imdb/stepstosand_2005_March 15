This is one of the worse movies I've ever seen. An insult to one's
intelligence. Unbelievable and just plain moronic, I could barely
watch. Tom Hanks was stiff and gave his worse performance ever. The
directing was dreadful. Only a five year old could come close to
believing any of this could ever happen. All the money spent on a
turkey like this is shameful. And to think that it was actually
successful is mind boggling. I was embarrassed watching it. The
producers and director involved should have been barred from the
industry for five years. The script should have been thrown away on
half a reading. To suggest that a retarded person could play football
is completely ignorant.
