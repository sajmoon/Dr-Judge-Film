This is one of those evergreen movies that you never get sick and tired
after watching it several times. This movie is about a very less than
ordinary man who does more than ordinary things in his life, his name
is Forrest Gump. Forrest is a man filled with innocence living in a not
so innocent world. He goes through life like everyone else but
achieving great things that most normal man can only think of dreaming.<br /><br />He went through college by being in the college football team and met
the president while doing that. He serve the military and got a medal
for his bravery in the war. He got into the the American ping pong team
and become the first foreigner to ever set foot in China after so many
years. He survived the hurricane and got to become a millionaire by
selling the scrimps he caught and he ran for 3 years and gave
inspiration to a few people along the way without realizing it. All the
things he achieved in life is redundant to him because the only thing
that matter to him is a girl name Jenny, the love of his life.<br /><br />For those of you who have not watched this movie, I don&#39;t know what you
have been doing the past few years because this is a movie that no one
should miss.
