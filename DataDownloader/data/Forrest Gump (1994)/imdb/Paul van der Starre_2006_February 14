Forrest Gump-The first thing i want to say about the movie is that it
has a wonderful soundtrack.After you saw the movie and listen to the
soundtrack you fully relive the movie.That makes a soundtrack a good
one. And a good movie needs a good soundtrack.But what i really wanna
say is how i was overwhelmed by actor Tom Hanks. What a wonderful
performance.So many and different emotions in one character and the way
he translate it on the screen is just great.Also a very nice thing
about the movie is that it has it all. Its romantic, dramatic,amazing
and sometimes funny. Everybody's movie i should say. Too bad of that
smiley on the shirt though but that is just for fun. But this is an all
time winner i guess.
