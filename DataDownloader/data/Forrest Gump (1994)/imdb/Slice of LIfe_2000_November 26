I rather liked it.  It was touching, often very funny, but somehow, Forrest
went from the &quot;loveable idiot&quot; of Winston Groom's novel to a &quot;leftover
innocent&quot; who goes with the flow.  Still, I think Tom Hanks did a good job
as Forrest, as did the rest of the cast.  <br /><br />What I really liked, I think, were the references to the &quot;greats&quot; of the day
like Elvis, JFK and such, but they don't really SAY who they are. <br /><br />And then there's everyone going around in a hurry as America goes from the
idyllic pastel days of the fifties and into the disillusioned, paisley world
of the sixties.  But through it all, Forrest has no idea what's going on. <br /><br />He does everything well, I think, like his drills (G*****n genius with an
outstanding IQ) or a shrimp captain (pure luck + prayer), and father (don't
know how he did that).  And mostly, he goes with his heart wherever his
brain cannot (which is QUITE frequently).  <br /><br />And that, I think, was what the movie was trying to say.
