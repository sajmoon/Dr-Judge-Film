Hailed as a classic when it first came out, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; now appears to
be
looked upon as a travesty, a shallow celebration of America's innocence.
Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the
character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the
American &quot;innocence&quot; he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to
be.<br /><br />In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary
on
the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor
Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good
hearted
young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping
mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at
great
speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny
(who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes
to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and
his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK.
Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench
awaiting
a bus.<br /><br />This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and
mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The
digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video
footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's
graces.<br /><br />The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places,
particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant
reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.<br /><br />Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and
Robin
Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother
(who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a
'normal'
school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary
Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled
in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a
sense of self.<br /><br />But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have
been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex
than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but
essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually
undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating
it.<br /><br />Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux
Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will
know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than
&quot;people
who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something&quot;.  Forrest continually
comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that
invites
to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.<br /><br />This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments.
One
such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a
bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness
in
her voice &quot;Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over.
Everybody gets a second chance...........&quot;<br /><br />Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the
genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With
his
much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the
audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny &quot;I'm not a
smart man.  But I know what love is&quot;, meeting his five year old son for
the
first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.<br /><br />Whilst &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, released at the same time and contrasted with this
film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of
American
life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm
sentiment in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.<br /><br />
