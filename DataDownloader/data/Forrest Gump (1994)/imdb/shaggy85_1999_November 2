1999_November 2 

forrest gump in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of all time. i
dont
know how it ended up at #175.  anyway, it had so much in it.  it could make
you laugh, cry, it had action in it, and it made you think in some parts.
it had an effect on a lot of people.  when i saw it in the theater, i would
look around after certain part, like the end where he is talking to his
dead
wife's grave, and there were so many people crying. thats why this movie
was
great, it touched a lot of people. it definetly deserved best picture of
the
year.  hanks also deserved best actor because that movie wouldn't have been
anything without him. he was perfect for the part.
10/10
