I have loved and appreciated many movies in my lifetime. If someone
asks me what my favorite is, the one that comes to mind first is
Forrest Gump. It doesn't matter that some other films might be greater,
or more important, or more beautifully executed. I think &quot;favorite&quot; is
still a measure that shouldn't be dismissed.<br /><br />Maybe the major reason it's my favorite is what I consider the main
message. Jenny is a *perfectly* beautiful woman who is focused on
herself. She seems determined to please herself, get high, pursue
whatever adventures she can, without much regard for others. And she
ends up more miserable than satisfied.<br /><br />Forrest is an *imperfect* man, whose every action is focused on serving
others as best he can. He knows how to take risks, make sacrifices. He
knows what love is. And ultimately, imperfect as he is, he is blessed
by being a blessing to others. Everyone he touches in his life is
blessed by knowing him.<br /><br />The fact that he also achieves material success is not the point; we
all know that's a fleeting reward. I think the most meaningful point,
the heart, of this lovely movie is that true happiness depends more on
being blessful than successful.
