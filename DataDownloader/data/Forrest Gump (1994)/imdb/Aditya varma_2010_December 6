This might be my first review In IMDb... But I have to tell you what i
felt after watching this movie.... I live in a place where i dunno
anybody and i dunno what i m doing... .I m away from my parents, away
from my brother....away from my life doing something just to earn money
and fame... .This movie explained me What i actually want from my
life...Just Love and only love.. .I Think about u mom!!! i miss u..
some movies are definitely life changing...for me this is...if you
think i m one emotional pervert.OK, but this is what this movie can do
to you....OK the performances were out of the world..the direction was
classy...and Tom hanks...what a performer he has been...he is
definitely gifted and is here to change lives of so many...I am one
among that few or many... ..For those who are just deciding to or not
to watch this movie, Please don&#x27;t afford to miss this movie.. ..this
might well change your destiny or may be not...
