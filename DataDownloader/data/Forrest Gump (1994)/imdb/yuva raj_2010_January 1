Tom hanks is just perfect guy for this role. i haven&#x27;t seen many movie
which has its heart and brain working towards the audience as this
movie does. We left fooled, amazed and sad at times with the eventful
life gump goes through. sometimes you feel hatred towards gump&#x27;s slutty
girl friend and sometimes you say its just fine.<br /><br />Forrest gump is a dumb head, hard fool and non practical guy for most
the people inside and outside the screen. but then when the movie ends
we keep thinking why we don&#x27;t have a heart like that. which cares, not
cunning, not judging people, not selfish.<br /><br />If you ask the story then its just a one liner. A good hearted man
travels through the ups and downs of his life, but for him both means
the same or none. camera keeps us engaged and direction is picture
perfect. every one wants to be him. its no preaching but a lot of
learning. its more a lesson than a movie but here the text book is the
man himself.<br /><br />good work and keep it working this way. worth watching more than one
time.
