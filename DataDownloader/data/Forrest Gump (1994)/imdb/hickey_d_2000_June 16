This film is about a &quot;slow-minded&quot; man who tries to do his best with his
life. Living with his mother for most of his life, he met his girlfriend
and
wife-to-be Jenny when he was a young boy. Forrest (Hanks) soon ends up in
the army with exceptional skills at repairing guns and running and saving
people. This is a great action movie with a couple of twists in it as
well.
A must-see.
