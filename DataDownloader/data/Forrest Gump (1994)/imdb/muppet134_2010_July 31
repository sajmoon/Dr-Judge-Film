About Forrest Gump... I&#x27;ll only say that I cried like a baby when the
movie ended and I&#x27;m not the type of person who cries whenever she sees
a chick flick or a drama. Seriously, there are only like three movies
that have made me cry and I mean real crying. This film has a soul and
you can easily fall in love with the characters. With this movie I
suffered, laughed and felt real tenderness towards Forrest. Sometimes I
feel that Academy Awards winners are overrated but this movie deserved
every award.<br /><br />Kudos, Tom Hanks <br /><br />It&#x27;s a must see if you consider yourself a movie fan.
