Saw this in the IMDb 250, and couldn't believe it was ranked this high.
Quite frankly, very sappy film about a mentally challenged individual
and how he influences key events through his life. I liked it when it
first came out, but every time I see it on TV, I realize that this is a
terrible movie. Essentially, it's a baby-boomer's movie reminiscing
about the events of times past. And the more I see it, it reminds me of
an earlier, even craftier movie with a simple-minded character which
was far more intelligent than this film will ever be...&quot;Being There&quot;
with Peter Sellers. Essentially the same story, but Sellers pulls of
the role more convincingly and the story unfolds much better. Forget
this film--&quot;Being There&quot; is the film to watch.
