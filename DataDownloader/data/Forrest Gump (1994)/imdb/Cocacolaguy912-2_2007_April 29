Was Forest Gump made with the intention of being a depressing movie? I
don&#39;t really think so. I think it was made with the intention of being
sad at parts, but ultimately a feel good movie that was supposed to be
quite funny at parts, entertaining, and even educational...not to
mention a great soundtrack.<br /><br />For me, the movie was all those things, but unfortunately, I found the
film, throughout all these jokes and happy moments, to be depressing.
For a guy who doesn&#39;t cry much at movies, I bawled at this one.<br /><br />I don&#39;t really know what my point is...I was sad.<br /><br />10/10.
