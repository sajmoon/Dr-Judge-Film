Forrest Gump (Hanks) is short on IQ points but long on heart, a pure
and simple soul who follows a straight path through the world, ever
true to the homely advice of his mother (Field) - the source of guiding
Gumpisms such as &quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot; - and to his elusive
lifelong love Jenny (Wright). He begins his serendipitous skirmishes
with destiny in childhood by unconsciously giving ideas to the
as-yet-unknown Elvis Presley, and goes on to become, unintentionally, a
football star and war hero.<br /><br />Considering all its mush and meandering, this is among the best
audience pleasers ever. Hanks outdoes himself in the lovable dolt
department with unforgettable, utterly disarming work. Just as he
recaptured boyishness in Big without resorting to cuteness, here he
brilliantly portrays slowness and dumb doggedness without being
patronising. Admittedly, the film does have its flaws but despite this,
it is simply unmissable and one of my all time favourite films.
