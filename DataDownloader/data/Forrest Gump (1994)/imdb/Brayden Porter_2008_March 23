OK, well there are too many words to describe this film, and none of
those words are negative at all. You can just tell from the opening
shot of the floating feather that a lot of love went into this movie,
and having an autistic brother probably made me appreciate it even
more. I think that&#39;s what is so good about this film, it&#39;s not trying
to make fun of slow people, and it&#39;s not trying to say that its a good
thing either. It&#39;s just telling us a story, and that story gives us a
message of how to appreciate people in the world around us even more.
But more than anything, its for entertaining us. And that&#39;s what I love
about Robert Zemekis... he&#39;s just one big kid with one big imagination,
telling us great stories! You will laugh and cry, I can assure you. And
your view on life and all of it&#39;s people will be changed for sure...
