First off let me be fair about the movie...nice special effects. Now with
that said sit back and let me rip the hell out of this horrible movie. I
personally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their own
batch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.<br /><br />From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie,
because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, or
sterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me.
I
personally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded his
buddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movie
only grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and would
have won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtar
part 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things to
come from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although better
films than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIG
HOLLYWOOD garbage machine. Come back Bob, you were once a promising
director.
