Tom Hanks' memorable performance as the ultra special Forrest Gump who does
a lot of strange but fascinating things in his life such as; running across
the United States of America too many times not stopping, saving a troop in
Vietnam, playing tennis with himself and much more. The movie is so great
and fascinating, inspiring and entertaining that you can't take your eyes
off it.<br /><br />Beautiful and an very deserving Oscar - winner, huge and
extatic!
STARS: ***** 5/5
