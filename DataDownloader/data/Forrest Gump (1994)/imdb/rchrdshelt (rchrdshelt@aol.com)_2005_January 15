What a movie. I remember the first time I saw it with my family and
myself and my mum cried, but it was such a great, powerful and deeply
moving film. The script, acting, directing, music, effects and every
other aspect are outstanding. The key to this film though here is
Hanks. I do not believe any other actor in the world could have played
the part as well as he did. He really is one of the best actors around
these days. People keep on saying that this movie mugged Shawshank
Redmption at the Oscars, which is very unfair because although that is
also one of my favourite films, this just about overtook it for me. The
script by Eric Roth and Hanks's acting here for me do by a small amount
outdo Shawshank although many will disagree. In fact I don't know how
earth Alan Silvestri's score didn't get an Oscar. It is probably one of
the best i've ever heard and The Lion King definitely didn't deserve it
i'm afraid. The same applies to Sinise's performance which also
deserved an Oscar. Anyway this film deserved its Oscars and is one of
the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />A classic. 10/10
