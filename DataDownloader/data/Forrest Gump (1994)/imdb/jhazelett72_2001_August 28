I had been counting the days until this title was released on DVD. I
always
tell my friends and other people that a true movie fan cannot choose just
one favorite movie, but if I had to make a choice, it would be Forrest
Gump.
Contrary to other opinions here, I believe this movie is inteligent. It is
the epitamy of American life.<br /><br />As a movie, Forrest Gump has something for everyone--humor, drama, action,
and romance. As a story, it tells of a man who, though not the brightest
crayon in the box, can take part in any historical event. Tom Hanks is the
only person who could make this character work, period. He plays Forrest
with an unwitting charm...you just have to care what happens to him. In my
opinion, it is the best performance of his career and more than deserving
of
the Oscar which he received.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a simple tale of a simple man who, for some reason (and
watching you really don't care why), is present for nearly every important
event in America's most recent history. Forrest's momma, played by Sally
Field in one of her finest performances, is his guide through most of his
early life. She teaches him that just because he's different, that doesn't
mean he isn't special.<br /><br />Forrest's romantic interest is Jenny, a young girl with whom he is very
much
in love. Fate delivers them onto separate paths, and yet Forrest and Jenny
seemed destined to always be together. The point here is, just as in our
reality, things happen that change our lives and we grow apart from those
about whom we care. Forrest seems to just shrug these changes off and love
Jenny unconditionally, the way true love should really
be.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are touching, the music is beautiful, and the
story itself is thought-provoking and meaningful. The DVD has a ton of
extra
features, though most of them are behind-the-scenes peeks. If you don't
own
Forrest Gump on video or DVD, I highly recommend you pick it up. After
all,
&quot;life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna
get.&quot;<br /><br />
