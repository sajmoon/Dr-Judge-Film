I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this movie. I usually
love Tom Hanks, but his acting was wooden and his character was
unbelievable. I was very disappointed when it received an academy
award. The movie was supposed to be inspiring, but it&#39;s hard for me to
be inspired when there&#39;s so little that&#39;s recognizable about a
character. I think the reason the box of chocolates line was quoted so
much was that that was all that was memorable about the movie. One
&quot;effect&quot; that I especially disliked was the technique whereby Forrest
Gump was included in old footage. In addition, I found myself worrying
about Sally Field&#39;s career. There was a period in her career when she
was in some excellent movies and this role as a pitiful mother
definitely seemed like a step down.
