It is very easy to understand that I haven&#x27;t read the novel in which
this film was based on, but that doesn&#x27;t take away anything about how
much I liked this film.<br /><br />I liked the whole story about Forrest Gump&#x27;s life as it revolves around
him and his personalities which makes it one of the best ones yet.<br /><br />I&#x27;m telling you, this film is not only one of the finest movies ever
made, but one of the greatest masterpieces of all time with great
comedy, a very nice concept, amazing emotional sad moments, good
development, and Tom Hanks&#x27; wonderful performance. Thumbs up from me.<br /><br />10/10
