Tom Hanks delivers a nuanced and cunning performance that cements his
status as one of the most talented actors of his generation in this
touching and beautifully rendered masterpiece.<br /><br />On the surface, it is the story of a mental midget who is haphazardly
thrust into pivotal and prolific moments, in history and in the lives
of those he loves. But Mr. Hanks imbues in his title character a
tugging and ironic mystery: Is he really the small-minded dolt everyone
assumes him to be, or is there something much more to him &#x96; something
we all wish we had?<br /><br />An impeccable supporting cast helps lift Mr. Hanks up. We see Robin
Wright as Jenny, the true and only romantic love of Forrest&#x27;s life,
battle demons on the road to her own personal and transformational
peace. Gary Sinise is nothing short of marvelous as the semi-crazed
Lieutenant Dan, and Sally Field hits the mark as Forrest&#x27;s doting and
insightful mother.<br /><br />Wonderfully paced and chock-full of memorable quotes, the film inspires
viewers to ponder questions so large as destiny and the true nature of
the just man.<br /><br />Lovely cinematography and an outstanding, apt soundtrack also help to
make this one of its decade&#x27;s finest films.
