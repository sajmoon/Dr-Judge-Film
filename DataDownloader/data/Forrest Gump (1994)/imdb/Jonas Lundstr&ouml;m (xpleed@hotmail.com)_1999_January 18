Forrest gump is a movie about a big hearted man who can achieve what a normal
man never could dream of.<br /><br />it starts out with forrest (tom hanks) sitting on a bus stop waiting for the
bus. he tells the story of his life for those who sits with him.<br /><br />he has an iq of 75 and everyone thinks he is stupid. but we get to follow him
through every major event in some of the biggest history events from 1950 and
forward. the story floates smothly and the jokes are brilliant. the movie is
one of the most romantic, loving ones i've ever seen.<br /><br />a man with an iq so small, but with a heart so big it pays up
double.<br /><br />the movie is as great as a movie can get. the actors are wonderful,
especially hanks, and denise.
the screenplay is beautiful the environments great. not to speak about the
special effects.
i can't seem to find one bad thing about the movie i try and try but i can't
find it.<br /><br />this is a must see!!
