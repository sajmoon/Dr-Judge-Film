This is the best film I have ever seen. It broke my heart, yet was so
funny in parts. It is impeccably acted, from even the youngest of cast
members, and the tapestry of Forrest's life crossing paths with
memorable historic events is magical. A young boy from the deep south
with a disability who meets such people as John Lennon, Elvis Presley
and two presidents of the United States! A story of romance,
prejudice,abuse, war, humour, drugs and most of all, serendipity, this
is a MUST-SEE film. Once I had seen it, I immediately purchased it on
DVD so that I could watch it with all my friends again and again. I
showed it to my best friend, and she too became enchanted. Please,
please watch this film. You owe it to yourself!
