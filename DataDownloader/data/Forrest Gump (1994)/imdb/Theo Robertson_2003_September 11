I remember the BBC coverage of the Oscars in 1995 . Barry Norman was asking
the Brits in Hollywood - Among them Tracey Ullman and Alan Parker - what
they thought of the years nominations and the British view was unanimous
that FORREST GUMP was nothing more than an overated mediocre movie . After
seeing the film for myself I`ve got to agree with the standard British view
- This is an overated mediocre movie <br /><br />It`s impossible to believe anyone outside America could love this movie .
The overated ( Third time I`ve used that word in this review ! ) Tom Hanks
plays Forrest the local town idiot who experiences many of the truimphs and
torments of 1950s 60s and 70s America , and it`s all produced , played and
written in a sickly sweet way , so sickly sweet you should watch this with a
bucket in your hand so you don`t get any vomit on the carpet.<br /><br />Amazing fact . Both American and non American voters on this site give
FORREST GUMP an identical voter average - 8.1 . I`m at a loss to explain
this
