2000_October 10 

This is my third viewing of 'Forrest Gump'.  The first time I was
unimpressed; the second time I had a concussion (rollerblades: too much
speed: car) and cried as soon as I saw the feather ; this time I only have
a
cold.
And this movie blows me away even more.
As a native southerner, I'm sensitive to 'South/Idiot' allusions in
popular
media, and instinctively braced myself for either sentimentality or
stupidity as that feather began its gorgeous journey.
Robert Zemeckis has created a masterpiece. Each aural allusion to
Beethoven's 9th Symphony is APPROPRIATE, amazingly enough.<br /><br />And that's all I've got to say about that.
