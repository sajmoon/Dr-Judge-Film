Okay, it begins like a friendly, warm family movie. But after a few
deaths and some language (including a use of the &#39;F&#39; word), it becomes
a bit obvious it&#39;s not a family movie. But it deserves quite a few
Academy Awards, and I heard that it even took it&#39;s makers by surprise.
Even though some parts of the film are completely different, it all is
one big, giant celebration of pandemonium and stupidity. It&#39;s funny in
places, like when Bubba is saying the names of all the shrimp, and at
the end of saying a huge number of shrimp, he says, &#39;and that&#39;s about
it.&#39; It&#39;s also scary in places, like when Forrest&#39;s girlfriend was
about to kill herself and then stopped. It&#39;s a great film, and is
usually a pleasure to watch.
