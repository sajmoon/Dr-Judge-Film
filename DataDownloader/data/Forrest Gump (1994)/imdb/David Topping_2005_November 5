This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one
where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the
idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw
it away.<br /><br />I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very
highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even
a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance
here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so
central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the
film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it
makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work,
how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go
past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a
belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.<br /><br />Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an
average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office
success and win multiple Oscars.<br /><br />Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work. I
still hated it.
