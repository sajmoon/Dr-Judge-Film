Forrest Gump is probably the best movie that I've ever seen! It's truly a
flawless movie that includes some of the best scenes ever made in a movie.
Forrest Gump is a movie that will make you laugh and make you cry, but by
the end, you will have enjoyed it so much. The story of Forrest Gump is a
great story, probably the best ever made! If you're looking for a movie that
you'll like, get Forrest Gump. It is the best!
