LET ME SAY THIS: WATCHING AN IDIOTIC FILM VERSION OF A GREAT BOOK IS NO
BOX OF CHOCOLATES.
This movie is (quite possibly) the WORST adaptation of a book to a
&quot;film&quot;.
When it was first announced that Forrest Gump was going to be adapted
for
the screen, I was very excited, as this was one of my favorite
stories.
I cannot begin to describe the nausea that overcame me as I sat through
the
slaughter of Winston Groom's literary masterpiece (tall tale of the
tallest). I was completely embarrassed in front of my friends (whom I had
dragged along to the movie theater with me); I had to urge them to read
the
book and forget what they had witnessed on the screen.
Everything about this movie, from the casting to the &quot;rewriting&quot;, was
just
plain wrong. It was as if the powers that be at the studio were waiting
for
someone in the audience to jump up and say: &quot;THE EMPEROR IS NAKED&quot;,
but(secretly) knew that the sheep would even eat weeds.<br /><br />
