NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />My previous comment about &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was extremely shallow, because I
wrote it under the influence of the user-comments I had read here before,
that evoked all the feelings I had in me, and utterly made my whole &quot;English
words repository&quot; die out. I was just shocked by the way people scorned this
exquisite movie - I didn't even think it can be disputed! I can't believe
that so many people have missed the gist of this movie... I am myself very
sarcastic about everything, but I can't find a SINGLE flaw in this one, I
really can't.<br /><br />How can people ignore the opportunity to LIVE in our world for 2 hours
through the eyes of a different, unique, INNATE VIRTUOUS human-being? You
can't imagine what you miss. My only advice to you is to search for your
feelings that must have been hidden somewhere, and utilize the SPELLBINDING
EXPERIENCE called &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.<br /><br />This movie's gist is not about dimwitted people, or about the American
history, or about how to succeed in life. It's about Forrest Gump, an
(unfortunately) fictitious man, that doesn't contain an ounce of wickedness,
or fraud, or falsity in himself. He doesn't even realize how much of these
last mentioned things our world has within it, he scarcely can recognize
them. However, when it comes to his true &amp; only love, Jenny, he's able to
confront them, and protect her from any hurt. And he DOES KNOW WHAT LOVE
IS.<br /><br />How can you not to empathize with him, not to love him with all your heart?
What is this drivel about this movie making fun of black or southern people,
or saying you have to sleep with or drag after other people to succeed in
life, or distorting the American history? That's nonsense!! Bubba, Gump's
black friend, can be white as well, and it will make no difference. So is
the &quot;American history&quot; aspect, that is only able to contribute to this movie
but not detract from it (even if you don't have a clue about America and
it's history - this movie is still perfect!)
EVERYTHING is captivating in this movie: The unique plot, the funny lines,
the quotes, Forrest's running times, his naive &amp; optimistic point of view at
the war and all the bad things, his true feelings and love that make us love
the ones he loves just because he loves them... although they don't always
deserve it. I just don't have the words to express all the things this movie
has contributed to me. It's more than a movie to me, and all I have left to
do is to be happy that there are people who feel the same.<br /><br />P.S: Tom Hanks - thank you... Gary Sinise &amp; all the others - magnificent
job!
