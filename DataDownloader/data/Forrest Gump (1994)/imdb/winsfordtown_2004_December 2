This film seems completely to divide opinion. I have to join the group
that doesn't know why everybody thinks it's so great. I find the whole
movie makes me cringe. Tom Hanks has to be the most over rated actor
around. His light weight performance of simpleton 'Gump' shows he
completely lacks any imagination. How this won best picture beggars
belief. It story seems to be made to fit the facts rather allowing the
characters developing on there own. Is Forrest Gump supposed to be a
poor man's Chance The Gardner spewing simple phrases that have profound
comment. Is this how America really wants the history of the sixties to
be remember for? Are we to assume that in the real world the simple
with no vices will really succeed. I'm sorry but I for one found this
mom and apple pie version of life hard to swallow.
