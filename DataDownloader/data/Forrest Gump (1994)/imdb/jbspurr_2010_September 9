&#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly
the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext
is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible
ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and
arbitrary ways. An exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking,
the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should
and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge,
which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the
better. &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary
Reagan era, with its &#x22;what me worry&#x22;, feel-good-about-America message,
regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering
we may countenance or cause (whether in Vietnam, Chile, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Angola, or Iraq, then or now). The movie was also a major
piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the Vietnam
War that began under Reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the
perfect fit for that most tenacious of &#x22;urban legends&#x22;, the spat upon
veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the Johnson
and Nixon regimes that put them in harm&#x27;s way, and then dumped them on
the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support
before PTSD was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in
combat). This movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing
nativism expressed by the likes of Sarah Palin and the &#x22;Tea Party&#x22;
movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in
America as well. It is not a &#x22;Candide&#x22; for our time.
