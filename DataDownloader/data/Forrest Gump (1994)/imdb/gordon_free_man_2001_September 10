I loved this movie ... It was the best experiance I ever had. ... it moves
you into forrest gump's world ... it is so heart warming ..and every thing
in it is soo perfect...the story line , acting , soundtrack etc....Tom
Hanks
was really great .... i kept thinking about the movie for years ..and i
can't get it out of my mind ... and there is no special scene in it....it's
all perfect!!!!!...no matter what most people say I give it 10 out of
10....I saw alot of famous movies but this one is different.....
