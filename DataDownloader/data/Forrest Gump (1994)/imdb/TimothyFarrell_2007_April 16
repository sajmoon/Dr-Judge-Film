&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is one of the most overrated films ever made. The fact
this beat &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; for the Best Motion Picture Oscar just proves
the Academy is as shallow as the movie-going public. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;
isn&#39;t well-made or an emotional experience, its just manipulative. The
fact Tom Hanks is a charming presence doesn&#39;t detract from the fact
that the character of Forrest Gump is entirely one dimensional. The
supporting performances are even duller. The direction by Robert
Zemeckis is occasionally impressive (particularly the montage sequences
detailing the popular culture at the time), but is aesthetically dull
and far too polished and manufactured. Also, the soundtrack seems
selected for the purpose of selling the soundtrack album as opposed to
meshing with the on screen action.<br /><br />What makes all this the more troubling for me is that the central
concept, an mentally retarded man wandering through several decades of
pop culture, had so much potential as satire. However, the filmmakers
squandered that to make an easy and simplistic film calculated to
please nondiscriminatory audiences. The film&#39;s humor comes across as
cute when it should be scathing. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is yet another
manipulative feel-good hit that left me unimpressed. (2/10)
