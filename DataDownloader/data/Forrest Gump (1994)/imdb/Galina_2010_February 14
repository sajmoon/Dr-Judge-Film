I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy
or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is.
It&#x27;s been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13-
years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We
laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the
hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual
lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released,
and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture,
Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The
film&#x27;s Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among
the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards
and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film
is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the
American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film&#x27;s main
idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your
intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you
would achieve the success in your life and even would change the
history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong
I believe they are. You can&#x27;t think of Forrest Gump as a real person.
He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with
no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick
or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through
whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for
about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an
intellectual prodigy but he was led through life&#x27;s hardships, by the
inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths
that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the
girl he loves and his Country. <br /><br />The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest&#x27;s point of
view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America
was very well presented through Jenny&#x27;s life. Between them two, I
believe the film&#x27;s creators were able to show the changing times and
changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a
marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film
soundtrack are great and I don&#x27;t mind them sound almost all the time
-the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task.
His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good
man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him
alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks&#x27;
performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar. <br /><br />When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it
did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a
great movie. And that&#x27;s all I have to say about Forrest Gump.
