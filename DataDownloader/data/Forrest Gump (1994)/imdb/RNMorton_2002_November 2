Leonard Maltin is usually right on, so I guess he can be forgiven for
blowing this one (and for missing Animal House). Sound and Fury-esquire
story of idiot savant Hanks, not the sharpest tool in the shed but
capable of some simple observations about living. And he gets to make a
lot of observations across several decades of an eventful life, in a
true tour de force by Hanks. Trick photography, placing Hanks with
celebrities of the times, doesn&#39;t overshadow main tale of Hank&#39;s
life-long romance with troubled Wright. Solid supporting cast is
highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for
Sixth Sense&#39;s child star as Forrest&#39;s son. Detractors may be taking
this movie too seriously, I don&#39;t think it means to be that
pretentious. Few movies in the last 50 years are so simply and
beautifully told; just sit back and enjoy.
