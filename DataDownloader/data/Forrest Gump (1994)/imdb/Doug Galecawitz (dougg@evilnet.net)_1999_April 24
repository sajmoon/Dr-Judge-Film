1999_April 24 

I like Forrest Gump. It's a very emotionally packed movie that is well
acted, written, and filmed. I think the film adaptation is better than the
book itself and the deep symbolism play an important role in that. The
rcreation of five decades in American History is truly a feat to be hailed.
And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing that strikes me
as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming
of Bubba's ansectors and Lt. Dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. Even
the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick
flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally
necessary to film, but they did anyway. That gives this movie an A for
effort in my book.
