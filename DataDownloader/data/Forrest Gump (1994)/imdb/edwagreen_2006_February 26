Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by
Tom Hanks. It's the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in
the right place while monumental events are taking place in this
nation's history.<br /><br />Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and
then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is
attempting to depict.<br /><br />Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been
rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing
that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.<br /><br />Gary Sinise's performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is
also splendid.<br /><br />Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you're going
to get. With &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; you will get the best of the best
chocolates.
