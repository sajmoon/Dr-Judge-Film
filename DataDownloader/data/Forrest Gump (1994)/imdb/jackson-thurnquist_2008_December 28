It Is, Truly, hard to describe this amazing movie. I came into writing
this having a good Idea of what to say, but when I think about it I am
drawn to blank about what to say.<br /><br />Let&#39;s just say this, Forrest Gump is a brilliantly fantastic movie full
of non-stop laughs, very dramatic scenes, and a strong romance. It is
definitely one of the best movies out there and deserves to be credited
as such. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Amazingly well and shines in this
fantastic film.<br /><br />Recommended to Anyone who is not offended by some sexual content, mild
violence, and brief language.<br /><br />100/10
