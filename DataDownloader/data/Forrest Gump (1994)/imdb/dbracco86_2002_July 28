I honestly thought there was no way you could NOT like this movie.  Well,
apparently I was wrong.  
It's absolutely incredible!  The movie discontinues an increasing trend that
movies are held up by great effects rather than great acting.  The three
lead actors (Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise) all deserved Oscars for
their stellar work.
True, this follows the ingredients to get Oscars, BUT, it helped pave the
way for that &quot;recipe.&quot;
10/10
