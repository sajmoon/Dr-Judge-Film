I remember the hype over this movie and the build up to the Oscars. I
too, got caught up in the &quot;isn't this marvelous&quot; stage, until I saw it
the third time -- well after the Oscars and Tom Hanks' win # 2. DO I
think he deserved it -- yes, but the movie itself doesn't stand up. The
movie itself is sweet but the historical edits -- and pure impossiblity
of the story doesn't help. The tone of the film isn't fantastical
enough to carry such a story -- it's too far in the realm of the real
to carry something as impossible, and this effect is far better
achieved in the book and in examples of films like &quot;Big Fish.&quot; Overall,
the players are what make this film good. Never mind Hanks but Robin
Wright is perfectly understated as Jenny and Gary Sinise was my
personal favorite as Lt. Dan, but the story, direction tone and
absolutely horrific historical editing, prevent this movie from being
brilliant. In fact, should anyone ever consider this the best movie of
it's year? One might, until they see &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;
