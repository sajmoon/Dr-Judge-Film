How can you start talking about a movie like &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; without being
bias on the whole hype that has been surrounding it since it came out. For
someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the
Academy Awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than...<br /><br />Pulp Fiction
The Shawshank Redemption
Quiz Show
and even Four Weddings and a Funeral<br /><br />and how could Robert Zemeckis' (I hate that name) work be considered
better
than...<br /><br />Krzysztof Kieslowski for RED!!!!!!!!!!!
Quentin Tarantino for PULP FICTION!!!!!!
Woody Allen for BULLETS OVER BROADWAY!!!!!!
Robert Redford for QUIZ SHOW!!!!!!!
Not to mention that the Academy is such an airhead that Frank Darabont the
director of The Shawshank Redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!!<br /><br />Let's consider MANY important factors for this movie to be loved blindly,
without a true sense of reflection and observation.<br /><br />Number 1: I have to much time on my hands,<br /><br />Number 2: It stars Tom Hanks who undoubtedly represents the white,
flawless
way of American Life. He is the Jimmy Stewart of today (that could not
hurt). He is talented, but highly overrated. He has some excellent
performances, but he always seems the same to me. He could never have the
talent that actors like Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Russell Crowe
or
Denzel Washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different
role. He is the typical American male sweetheart, regardless everybody
loves
him. His star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to
get sold and appreciated.<br /><br />Number 3: Stories about characters with disabilities always, and I mean
always sell in Hollywood (Rainman, I am Sam, Nell, My Left Foot,
Awakenings,
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) not that I am saying that these great
films
compare to Forrest Gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad
sells.<br /><br />Number 4: The history of the United States is taken rather lightly in this
movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without
his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. Racism, Vietnam,
meeting
a number of American Presidents, his unheard speech at Lincoln Memorial,
the
hippies, drugs, Bubba Gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic
events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp
the
magnitude of those very events. He is mentally handicaped as we are shown
from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is
emotionally handicap too. He never seems to get emotionally affected by
anything, unless it involves Jenny, even then it does not appear to be
convincing or moving in any way.<br /><br />Number 5: The story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy,
uncompromised and made in half measures. It touches certain issues, but
never dwells on them with justice. The ingenuity of the character, his
disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a
certain depth. Which they are not. It is unfair, because Hanks' charm and
Gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. It
never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the  story and
into
the gut of what was attempted to be said.<br /><br />Number 6: Stupid moments, everybody loves them, Hollywood is an expert of
what people like and what they want to spend their money on. Gump begins a
&quot;marathon&quot; across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides
he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a
metaphor
for the movie itself). Elvis Presley the King or Rock ends up as a
youngster, who knows how, in Gump's house as a visitor. Gump who has
braces
in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous.
Something that I personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an
issue
like the Vietnam War, but Forrest somehow manages to run in and out the
jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. Maybe Zemeckis
never
read a book or even watched a film (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal
Jacket, Casualties of War) to illustrate him on what really happened on
that
war. Young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. Forrest Gump is a
fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of
&quot;reality&quot;.
Oliver Stone dedicated his film Platoon to the American soldiers in
Vietnam,
he went there for real and saw what happened. Zemeckis has decided to
ignore
all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even
be
immune to a experience like Vietnam (in every aspect possible).<br /><br />To conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because
Forrest Gump won the oscar for Best Picture makes it one of the best films
of the 90's. The &quot;sweetness&quot; of this movie is not even sweet, its only the
a
ploy, a sales pitch of the American Dream.
In 20 years who will remember Forrest Gump, and more importantly who will
remember that film when The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction are
still
in people's memories for real reasons. They are art films, Forrest Gump
the
oscar's favorite.<br /><br />And seriously folks if you haven't seen Kieslowski's RED run over to
blockbuster and rent it. Its the end of the Color Trilogy. Then you'll
know
what we mean.<br /><br />thank you.
VIVA EL CINE!!!!<br /><br />
