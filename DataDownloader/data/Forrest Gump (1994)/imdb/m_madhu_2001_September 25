Forrest gump is an overrated movie that has just a lot of smart ideas
going
for it. by no stretch of the imagination is this movie a classic, and most
definitely did not deserve the oscars that year. i hate to say it again,
but
i think its the academy's fascination with americanism that makes it chose
movies like this one, saving private ryan &amp; american beauty over other
outstanding movies from those years.<br /><br />the series of anecdotes that link up gump's simple life to world-changing
historical events are quite cute and makes u smile a bit, but really thats
all the movies has going for it - that and tom hanks' captivating
performance. but again, as has been said before by many others - a
slightly
over-rated movie.<br /><br />a charming 7
