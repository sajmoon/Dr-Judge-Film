1999_April 1 

I can understand how this anti-counterculture propaganda piece was popular
with right-wingers, but how on Earth it managed to receive any Award
recognition is beyond me.  The faults are too numerous to mention, but
here
are a few.  The length: The film teeters on endlessly, adding no new
insights to an extremely limited title character who is much less than a
&quot;tabula rasa&quot;.  The &quot;message&quot;:  What exactly is the point of this film?
To
glorify Stupidity, and I am NOT speaking of &quot;simpleness&quot; as I have often
heard when discussing this disaster on celluloid.  The message seems
clear,
if you are a thinking human being, like the Robin Wright character, you
are
destined to suffer through such horrors as prostitution and AIDS.  A
stripper/folksinger?  Please.  Lovely special effects aside, this
meandering
piece of treacle is not only boring, but offensive.  The dumbing down of
America is clearly alive in this debacle of the cinema.
