2000_January 3 

The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is
re-written.<br /><br />Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the
anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly
felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be
for their troubles as well.<br /><br />This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and
even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were &quot;Unamerican&quot; in every
sense of the word.<br /><br />The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think
about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well
at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close
enough.<br /><br />It's enough to make a person gag.<br /><br />Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best
picture Oscar doesn't help either.
