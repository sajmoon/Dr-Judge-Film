2000_May 9 

Perhaps one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen.  I fear for a
society that adores and embraces a movie without looking beyond the
surface.
This movie is, at its core, a celebration of mediocrity.  Sort of like the
current popularity of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,&quot; (which lets the
average person feel smart because they can answer easy questions) this
movie
is designed to make the average person feel great about themselves for
being
nothing more than average, just like Forrest.<br /><br />I agree with the comments that infer a fascist or totalitarian subtext to
this movie.  This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if
the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without
doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a
&quot;success&quot; without trying.  A satisfied public is easy to control, for
better
or for worse . . .
