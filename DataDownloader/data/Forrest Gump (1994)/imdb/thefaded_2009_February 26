Forrest Gump, the 1994 movie from director Robert Zemeckis, is a film
that appeals to the masses. From the most avid movie goers to those who
haven&#39;t seen a movie in who-knows-how-long, there is something in it
that everyone can enjoy. This movie features both a brilliant
soundtrack that appeals to many different music lovers and stunning
special effects that catch the eye and boggle the brain. It has been
highly critically acclaimed, winning many awards in several categories.
It&#39;s also very easily accessible to everyone.<br /><br />One of the things that really stands out about Forrest Gump is the
all-star soundtrack. The Movie&#39;s score features music from such artists
as Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi
Hendrix, The Doors, Lynard Skynard, The Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood
Mac, just to name a few. The music in this movie does a great job
setting the mood and the tone for the time period it portrays and the
major events that take place in the story. The soundtrack has heavily
influenced several movies in the years since it was released. Its
impact was so large that many movies with similar themes and historical
timeframes have almost copied the soundtrack entirely. The film even
won the Oscar for &quot;Best Music, Original Score&quot; in 1995. With a
soundtrack like that, it doesn&#39;t even need to be watched &#150; you can
enjoy the movie with your ears alone.<br /><br />Those who do happen to keep their eyes open for the show are never
disappointed by the special effects. The storyline of the movie
wouldn&#39;t be able to survive without the menagerie of CG and makeup that
fits every aspect of the story like a glove. The CG managed to place
Forrest in several highly unlikely circumstances with ease, and made
the audience believe he was actually there. Through the use of this
then-innovative technology, Forrest ends up in such places as meeting
John Lennon on Captain Kangaroo, conversing with both Kennedy and
Nixon, witnessing the first black students allowed on a white college
campus, and running from an explosion in Vietnam that narrowly misses
him. The makeup transforms Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan Taylor) into an
amputee, and brings Sally Fields (Mrs. Gump) through time from young
mother to old woman. Even for a movie made 15 years ago, these special
effects have managed to survive the test of time and still look
believable.<br /><br />While we are on the subject of special effects, it has to be mentioned
that Forrest Gump won the Oscar for &quot;Best Effects, Visual Effects&quot;, as
well. In fact, the movie managed to win several awards. It won a total
of six Oscars, and was nominated for seven more. Among the movie&#39;s
other Oscar wins were: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Tom Hanks), Best
Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best
Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. The movie
also managed to grab up an amazing thirty-two additional awards from
other awards shows. These awards were well deserved, but not surprising
considering the well-known cast and crew, not to mention the brilliant
writing and editing. This was not the first award-winning movie for
director Robert Zemeckis, who directed Roger Rabbit and Back to the
Future, two other films well-known for their brilliant innovation and
special effects.<br /><br />If anyone out there still hasn&#39;t been convinced to see this movie,
there is one more excellent reason to do so: accessibility. Because
Forrest Gump has been so critically acclaimed, and due to the fact that
it came out so long ago, a person often doesn&#39;t have to spend a dime or
even leave their house to see it. It&#39;s very easy to catch on TV &#150; in
fact, it will be on HBO at 7PM on Friday, February 27th. For those who
don&#39;t want to wait for it to come to them, it is very easily found in
your family&#39;s movie collections, sold at almost any store that sells
movies, or should be readily available at your local rental location.
It&#39;s also very cheap. It&#39;s been known to hit the five-dollar bin at
Wal-Marts across the US, and is seen at almost every garage or yard
sale. This isn&#39;t a movie that you&#39;ll ever see sold out, either. Most
movie buffs have already seen it, so it&#39;s never too in-demand to be
able to find.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a movie that just has to be seen. Between the
soundtrack and special effects, everyone can find something to enjoy.
Just look at the awards success the movie has had &#150; that alone has to
be a clue as to how brilliant it is. If that&#39;s not enough, you really
can&#39;t lose if you take a gamble and watch it on TV. You can rest
assured, there&#39;s not going to be anything better on.
