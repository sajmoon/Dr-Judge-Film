Every review I've ever read of this great flick has always said
&quot;well-meant
but flawed.&quot;  That's bull!  How flawed can a movie be when it takes a man
through college football, Vietnam, ping pong, shrimping, and running
several
times across America?  Everybody from Elvis to Abbie Hoffman to Nixon to
Kennedy to John Lennon to Dick Cavett to Lyndon Johnson make surprising
and
pleasant appearances.  While the film may be slightly exaggerated to keep
this guy moving, the two hours of film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; uses are spent
giving
us the best summation of pop culture and textbook history we're probably
ever going to see.  And through it all, Forrest continually turns to his
best friend Jenny, who sees Forrest as a good friend who doesn't know any
better, which is why she tries so hard to maintain her innocence around
her
IQ-troubled friend.  While Forrest may never fully realize the
30-something
years of history he encounters, he does recognize friends and family as
the
real center of the world, which is played out beautifully in the last
scene,
which hands the baton to a new generation of kids who may be more socially
aware than their parents.  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a must-have for anyone who
enjoys people and movies.
