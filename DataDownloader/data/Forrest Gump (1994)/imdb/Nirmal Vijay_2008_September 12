Life is full of mysteries; either live it momentarily or eternally.<br /><br />Just count the maximum number of people you will ever meet in your
lifetime. But you can only &#39;live&#39; with &#39;one&#39; of them. The rest are all
side-kicks you may not need all the time. But that &#39;one&#39; person is all
that matters between living (running) and dying (trying to re-connect).<br /><br />Please do not interpret Forrest Gump as you do with other movies. This
movie shows an aspect of our lives dissected in the most meticulous way
that we ourselves might not be interested. But to watch it in the life
Forrest Gump is a wonder.<br /><br />Forrest Gump gives the view of the world that most people experience in
their lives but hardly speak about it.<br /><br />&quot;To him the world is stupid. To the world he is stupid&quot; It is a simple
philosophy stretched into a movie that is well done.
