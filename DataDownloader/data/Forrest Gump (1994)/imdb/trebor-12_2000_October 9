2000_October 9 

I waited until I had seen this film for the second time, before making a
judgement.  My initial reaction was correct it is one of the worst films I
have ever seen, only Bean was worst.  The film fails everywhere apart from
the acting.  The script, locations some appalling dialogue and dreadful
sentimentality, that must be lost on a non-US audience. Absolutely awful
1/10
