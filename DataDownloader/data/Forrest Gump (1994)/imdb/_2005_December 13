To the person who mentioned the Zen of Forrest Gump: the feather at the
beginning says it all, doesn't it?! You may notice that ALL movies are
zen, but the ones with the clearest message are the most successful.
(The fact that there are more and more types of movie awards each year
attests to this fact.) There is so much more to this if you wish to
seek it; though like Forrest, you'll eventually find it right where you
are! Apparently I need more lines here to get this message posted. How
about some book titles (forgive me that I may not remember exact
titles, authors for each, or correct spelling of names): &quot;Everyday
Mind&quot; (a real box of chocolates, my friend!), &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's
Mind&quot; by Shunryu Suzuki, &quot;An Introduction to Zen Buddhism&quot; by D.T.
Suzuki, &quot;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&quot; by Dan Millman (for the athletes
out there), anything by Thich Nhat Hahn. Dogen is pretty good, though
it may be murky at first. Skip the Hakuin until you're ready. He's pure
poison! You can find many more for yourself!
