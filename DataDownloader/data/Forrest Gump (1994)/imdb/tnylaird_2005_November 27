what a film. The special fx Unbelievable you've got to love Forest even
though every thing was against him, from his bad legs to his low I.Q he
saw the good in everyone Tom Hanks played the part excellently. My
favourite film of all time. It has every thing action comedy romance.
another great thing was the soundtrack you've got elivs, bob Dylan, the
beach boys &amp; the doors the music makes the film that extra bit special.
usually you watch films you only remember small parts, in this you're
amazed by what he achieves that you remember everything his football
career, ping-pong success, medal of honer &amp; all those trips to the
white house. Forest Gump is Tom Hanks at his best
