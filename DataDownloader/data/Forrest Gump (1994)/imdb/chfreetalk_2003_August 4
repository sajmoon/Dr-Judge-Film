American movies in the past few years are not as good as the movies
decades
of years ago.Maybe the directors pay too much attention to bringing the
modern technology to the film to create better scenery or sound
effect,while
they ignore the story itself ,which is the essence of one movie.Titanic is
one example.If you see through it,you will find it just such a simple
story
that  isn't worth your tears.How can it be compared with Casablanca or
even
Waterloo bridge?But Forrest Gump is an exception.It can make you laugh,and
make you sad.It just shows how a man grew,what he got and what he
lost.It's
plain but moving.And the music is also good.Some old music may remind you
of
the old days.All in all,it's perfect.
