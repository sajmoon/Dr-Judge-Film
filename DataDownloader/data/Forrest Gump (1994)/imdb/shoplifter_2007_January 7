This movie is definitely in my top ten list. Every scene makes you want
to have a taste of the next one already without even knowing what will
happen in that previous one. It&#39;s surrealistic because so many great
events happen to the main character his life almost turns into a modern
fairy tale. It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s meaningful and honest and true. The
story is inspiring and once you&#39;ve seen it you won&#39;t ever forget it
because it&#39;s simply a masterpiece. When I saw Forrest Gump for the
first time I couldn&#39;t think of doing anything else. Because normally I
get a drink, roll a cigarette or get something to eat when I watch at
home, but with this one I was so fascinated it just flew me toward the
end on a cloud of movie wonder and top acting. Thank you Robert
Zemeckis for directing this work of art. Thank you Gary Sinise, Robin
Wright Penn, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field ... for amazing
performances . Thank you Tom Hanks for being Forrest Gump and making
millions of people happy and moved because this is one of the best!
