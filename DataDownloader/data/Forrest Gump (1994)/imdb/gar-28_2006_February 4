In Philadelphia Hanks played a gay man dieing of AIDS fired because of
his sexuality. It took courage to take the part and Hanks used to to
open the heats and minds minds of many viewers. When I first saw Gump I
thought it was sentimental and cloyingly sweet. After talking to a
friend who works with the handicapped my impression changed. Underneath
the sugar coating the movie presents the idea that if people with IQs
below 90 wanted to they could get into the army (Gump would never have
gotten into the army), be war heroes, start successful businesses and
become rich. It makes believable the idea that these people need no
help from the rest of us. Hanks is cute, beguiling and an altogether
'lovable little retard'. The image it presents of real handicapped
people who struggle to get by in our world is callous and degrading.
