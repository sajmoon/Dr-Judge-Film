The concept of the movie at the first instant might seem a bit absurd
because you might seem to wonder how a man can be intelligent and act
stupid at the same time. But this is exactly what Tom Hanks manages to
do and do it perfectly.<br /><br />This is a story of a man whose IQ is lower than that of a normal person
but still manages to do everything in life on his own and manages to
find love in his life through Jenny. Every moment in the film
emotionally touches you especially the sequences between Jenny and
Forrest. The dialogs are really gripping and makes you take notice of
the hard-work put into writing those lines.<br /><br />Special mention has to go to the writing department. Not easy to create
a character to which audiences can relate. A very subtle story,
beautifully crafted and perfectly executed. Director Robert Zemeckis
has put up a commendable effort for giving us his most-prized
possession of his career.<br /><br />But the film stands firmly on its feet mainly due to Tom Hanks. The
actor deserves his second successive Oscar after Philadelphia. He
manages to bring out one of the best performances of his career, ably
supported by Gary Sinise, a deserving Oscar nomination. The sequences
between them are hilarious to watch and they share a great on-screen
chemistry.<br /><br />The movie in itself is a revolution. Such movies are hard to come by.
Do yourself a favor and waste no time in catching this movie. Just like
in the movie all used to tell Gump &#x22;Run, Forrest, Run.&#x22;, I say to you,
&#x22;Run, Viewers, Run.&#x22;
