This movie, nothing more than a cheesy scenes needlessly thrown
together, truly has no heart or point to it, and is among the worst
that I have seen. It attempts to do everything without focusing its
attempts. Just like the way that a person who tries to multitask only
does a semi-good job on either task, this movie does no good job at
anything. If the movie were sped up, it would seem like a parody of
Hollywood films. I am honestly shocked that anyone enjoyed this film.
Not only did the Oscars like it, they liked it more than &#x22;The Shawshank
Redemption&#x22; and &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22;, both among the best movies of all
time,and both released in the same year.
