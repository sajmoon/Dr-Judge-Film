Robert Zemeckis brings Winston Groom&#x27;s novel to the big screen in a
film that is easy to mock and reject but that, when actually watched on
screen instead of viewed through the filter of memory, is simply a fine
movie and a magnificent meld of sound and visuals, courtesy of one of
the best soundtracks ever.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays our titular character, a simple man who somehow ends up
circling many important events as he goes through his life, innocent
and conforming. He meets Elvis, presidents, ends up in Vietnam, becomes
a ping pong wizard, goes shrimping and runs a lot (&#x22;run, Forrest, run&#x22;)
but despite his travels and experiences his heart always belongs to his
Jenny (Robin Wright).<br /><br />I like Tom Hanks and I like this movie. A lot. But let&#x27;s be totally
honest here, the central performance is a rather easy, goofy one and
there&#x27;s nothing here that shouts &#x22;Oscar&#x22; except to those who somehow
gave Hanks his second Oscar for this role. Gump is lovable enough but
not really all that complex. Robin Wright fares well as the young girl
who wins his heart and spends far too much time damaging her own. Gary
Sinise is fantastic in a role that reminds you that he should be doing
so much more nowadays than TV work, Mykelti Williamson is great fun to
watch and Sally Field is . . . . . kinda Sally Field-ish.<br /><br />It&#x27;s strange how innocent and yet twisted this movie is. The movie
starts off with one simple man talking to a stranger on a bench while
they wait for a bus and that man&#x27;s narration covers topics as dark and
diverse as coping with disability, child abuse, drug taking, life at
war, racism and AIDS. Things may only be alluded to or hinted at but
they&#x27;re there, in Forrest&#x27;s life, and they all make an impact.<br /><br />With that in mind, it&#x27;s hard to consider the movie as a straight,
standard comedy-drama or as an all-out black comedy. Whichever way you
view it, and Forrest&#x27;s complete conformity seemingly making his life
turn out for the best puts me in the latter camp, it&#x27;s a wonderful
movie that veers into schmaltz once or twice but that has enough
entertainment value elsewhere to make this forgivable.<br /><br />See this if you like: Zelig, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, Sling
Blade.
