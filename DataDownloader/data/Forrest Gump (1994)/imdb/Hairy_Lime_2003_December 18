People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or
to nausea.  But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong
performances but not more than that.  The core of this movie that is as
simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's
reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how
shallow the movie's entire argument is.<br /><br />But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have
been annoying in other hands but works well here.  Sinise was excellent as
well.  Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for
the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's
were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. 
The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot
of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.<br /><br />If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie.  But then, she fell
asleep during Casablanca, so....
