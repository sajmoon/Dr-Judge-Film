***Spoiler Alert*** Forrest Gump is one of the most impactive,
respected and popular films of the 90&#x27;s. Widely considered one of the
best films o all time, and while this is very subjective, the depth of
this film in itself should be enough to at least make people accept its
brilliance. In case you don&#x27;t know, Forrest Gump is in fact a symbol of
America. The story follows the main character, who, while not being the
sharpest nor most intelligent main character alive, still manages to
somehow just do the right things, attain success, and always make the
best of others... Don&#x27;t get too excited now though, cause while we have
the naive, well-meaning Forrest, for whom life isn&#x27;t too serious, we&#x27;ve
also get Jenny, who ends up as the opposite. A symbol of everything
rotten within America. Don&#x27;t get it wrong, she&#x27;s not an antagonist,
actually it&#x27;s just the sad irony, that Forrest, who attains everything
by luck and good intentions, Jenny, who has all the ordinary traits and
possibilities which Forrest do not have, simply picks all the wrong
choices. So much for the American Dream... While these two characters
respectively journeys through the best and worst periods of the
country, there&#x27;s always a somewhat romantic relationship between the
two, which of course has to result in a child. Forrest Gump deserves
just as much attention as it got. Everything form acting to directing
to filming is perfect, and while one could keep up the endless
discussion bout which of it and Pulp Fiction deserved the Best Film
Award, the outcome shouldn&#x27;t bother too many... Incredibly intelligent
and exciting film...
