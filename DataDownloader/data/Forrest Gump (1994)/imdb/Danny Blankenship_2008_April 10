&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; certainly has to be one of the most heart touching and
emotional films that brought joys to the masses over the years. People
misjudge it though as a film about a dumb retarded boy named Forrest,
yet I see it as a much different take as it proves it&#39;s okay to be
different and slow and do things at your own pace and let things come
to you and then good things will happen in life. Tom Hanks is great as
Forrest Gump as the film spans a life period from Forrest&#39;s childhood
to his growing up, starting with his humble start in a small Alabama
town with his mother(wonderfully done by Sally Field). From the start
Forrest was different as his mother taught him to see the world and
life as a box of chocolates, not knowing what your ever gonna get. Yet
by the hardships and for the way that Forrest was made fun of his
determination and will would spark him on a life of unexpected but
deserved greatness. From his college attending at the university of
Alabama to his football playing to fighting in war, and making new
friends to meeting the presidents! Also touching is his heartfelt
relationship with life love Jenny(Robin Wright Penn). The direction and
camera work and special effects of the way the film is crafted by
Robert Zemeckis is brilliant and fabulous it makes the film move well
from time period to time period. Most of all this film brings the
message to me that destiny is often a piece of crap and life many times
just goes and happens at random. Most of all it&#39;s okay to be different
and it proves no matter how different that just by being simple many
things can be accomplished, and that with faith and determination with
god anything is possible. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is such a memorable winner
because he did it his way.
