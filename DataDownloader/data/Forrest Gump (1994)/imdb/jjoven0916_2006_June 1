This is probably the best movie in the 90&#39;s,unforgettable
scene,script,best music performance,famous quote,best actor...etc. I
wonder how they come up with a story so good as this, because it wasn&#39;t
a short movie for as long as I know, and every scenes and lines weren&#39;t
keep you bored from this long hours for watching Forrest Gump,and
although it&#39;s not a action movie or horror movies but because the story
was too good I couldn&#39;t even leave my seat. <br /><br />I think we should all learn about how to face our life from
difficulties from this movie!!!It&#39;s good to be simple, kind and hard
worked!!!
