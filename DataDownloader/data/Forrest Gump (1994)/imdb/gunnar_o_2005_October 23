This movie might be simple to some people, and somehow it is. But there
are so many layers in that movie that it's ones approach that sets the
level of simplicity. To me making' a movie like that is simply clever
and somehow stunning, and the acting of Mr. Hanks must place him in a
league of his own. Despite the thoughtfully screenplay the real
strength of this movie is the basic points, and the way it touches
fundamental issues like life, death, irony of fate, destiny (or none!).
This combination of topics, the way it's delivered and the historical
view as well touches very deep. I've seen this movie about five times
and it touches me deeply every time, this is a masterpiece that no one
should miss.
