         Forrest Gump is easily a great movie. Tom Hanks played so well as
Forrest, a shy but very understanding and good man. The plot was very well
and got me through my problems. This might be the best of 1994, if not that,
than it's one of the best. The tagline made people want to see this film and
it did huge in the box office. This had action, emotion, comedy, and
friendship which put people into a different outlook on life. I think every
person should watch this film. You have to se it through Forrest Gump's eyes
to believe the unbelievable. If your having stress over life, please see
this film and you could change different personalities, totally. See this
film!!<br /><br />10/10
