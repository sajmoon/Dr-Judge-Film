Tom Hanks shines as Forrest Gump, a metally challanged man. As do his very
talented co-stars, including, Gary Sinise as his vietnam commanding officer
Sally Feild as his loving mother and Robin Write as his friend for life
Jenny.<br /><br />We see many things happen to Forrest in his life, from wearing braces on his
legs as a youngster, to him meeting Jenny, and through almost 30 years he
sees some of the most unforgettable events in history.<br /><br />He touches many lives including Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) another mentally
challenged man, Captain Dan (Sinise) who is crippled during the
war.<br /><br />This is a film where you either love it or hate it. Well i loved it and it
is a truly excellent film, Hanks is wonderful.<br /><br />10/10
