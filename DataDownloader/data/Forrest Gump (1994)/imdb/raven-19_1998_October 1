The rest of the comments in the comments section seem like they are talking
about another movie. What does Forest Gump lack? Plot? Imagination?
Originality? Excellent acting? By all means, none of those! Why should it be
compared to The Shawshank Redemption, I can't comprehend. These are both
excellent movies, but of a very different genre. Personally, I wasn't as
touched watching The Shawshank Redemption, and never have I laughed as much
as was moved in the same movie.<br /><br />Hanks' acting was the apogee of his career, not even outmatched by his role
in Saving Private Ryan, which I loved, and consider the greatest war film of
all time.<br /><br />The story is indeed eye-watering. An improvement of the novel. Behind the
character of Forest Gump hides a philosophy.... An awe to the man who knew
nothing yet lived them all.<br /><br />Merely, Forest Gump is a classic.
