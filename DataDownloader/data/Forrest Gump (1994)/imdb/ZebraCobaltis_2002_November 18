There's something really nasty at the heart of this movie which
makes my skin crawl. It's the story of a simple-minded retard
unquestioningly accepting the word of all authority figures in his
life. He winds up a multi-millionaire living in a huge mansion and
adored by all. His girlfriend Jenny, on the other hand, is an
intelligent young girl who is abused by her father. She leaves
home for college and tries to make her own way in life, ending up
with a violent partner, addicted to drugs and dying of
AIDS.
No amount of gloss could render such message palatable. Utter
garbage.
