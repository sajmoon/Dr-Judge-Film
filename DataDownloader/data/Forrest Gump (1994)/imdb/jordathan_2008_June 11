just kidding. i love this movie. i mean, it makes me cry every time i
see it.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis has never been better as a director. Tom Hanks has
never been better as an actor. the screenplay by Eric Roth absolutely
sparkles with imagination. i tried reading the novel by Winston Groom
once and couldn&#39;t handle it. i thought it was pretty awful compared to
the writing of the film.<br /><br />a multi-generational film, it is an interesting take on the &quot;American
Dream&quot; as we have come to know it in the past half century of American
history. though 1994&#39;s Pulp Fiction is probably the better film of the
two, Forrest Gump is clearly more charming and thus an undeniably
worthy winner of that year&#39;s Oscar for Best Picture.<br /><br />it&#39;s a known fact that the only people who don&#39;t like this movie are
Osama bin Laden, Captain Hook, Cruella DeVil, and Sauron.
