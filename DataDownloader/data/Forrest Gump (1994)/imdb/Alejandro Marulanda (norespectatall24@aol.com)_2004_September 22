Tom Hanks gave his the best acting in this movie. All the situations
that he is put into. We all know that this can never happen but,
FORREST GUMP could. From going to the Vietnam war, owning his own
shrimp boat, and meeting the president again. This movie when i first
saw this movie i didn't really get I just thought it was just another
movie about someone life but, when i saw again I got a different
perspective of it. You can be a nobody and turn into a somebody. But
enough sentimental stuff. It also had its comedy like &quot; Are you stupid
or something&quot;? &quot;Stupid is as stupid does sir&quot;. It also a movie about
love. He was the greatest. I mean what wouldn't he do for jenny. Great
movie.
