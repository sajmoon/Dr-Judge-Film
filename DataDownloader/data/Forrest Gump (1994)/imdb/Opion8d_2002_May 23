*Forrest Gump*<br /><br />1994 was a decent year for movies.  Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank
Redemption were good films.  So was Forrest Gump.  It's really starting to
make me angry seeing people pan this movie so much!  It's not a bad movies! 
I have seen thousands of worse films.  And quite frankly this one was better
than Shawshank, but not as good as Pulp Fiction.  But who can see the
Academy giving the Oscar to Pulp Fiction, anyway?<br /><br />It's sad to know this movie can't be disscussed without talking about those
other movies.  I believe people need to get over it!  What does the Academy
know anyway?  They gave an Oscar to Opie! <br /><br />Moving on, this movie has great acting.  Tom Hanks is perfect for the role
as a slow-witted southerner.  That didn't sound very nice...  I like Hanks,
I think he's made some of the best films of the 90's!  But his Oscar was
well-deserved.  Robin Wright does a great job as Jenny (or as Forrest might
say 'Jen-nay').  And Gary Sinese was hilarious as Captian Dan. <br /><br />This movie has some of the most memorable characters in history!  Not to
mention it's one of the most quoted movies (Life is like a box of
chocolates, stupid is as stupid does, exc).  <br /><br />So, yes, it deserved winning best picture that year.  It was a great movie,
probably on my top 100 of all time list!  <br /><br />*9.5/10*
