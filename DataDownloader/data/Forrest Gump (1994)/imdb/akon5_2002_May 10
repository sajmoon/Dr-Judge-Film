One thing I wanted to get straight, the movie Forrest Gump is an intelligent
film. Many of you will disagree, but that is because you are not seeing this
film in the light of its full potential. I can name tons of scenes which
trigger in one way or another a philosophical ideology. And I mean
TONS!<br /><br />The oh so famous feather scene...<br /><br />The scene when Forrest is at Jenny's grave...<br /><br />The scene when Forrest just finished running<br /><br />Even his name Forrest has a meaning.<br /><br />The movie itself holds the meaning that the measurment of success is not by
intelligence and fame, it is by a simple notion of happiness. Forrest could
be a million-air, but he is happy to mow the lawn for free.<br /><br />There are many people I talk to don't understand this film. The reason is
because they can't relate to it.
