&quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; 1994&#39;s controversial and acclaimed Best Picture Oscar
winner and is itself adapted from the novel by Winston Groom, is the
simple story of a simple man and the not-so-simple world he is born
into. Tom Hanks is the title character, a Southerner with an IQ of 75,
who as a boy is handicapped by a crooked back and forced to wear leg
braces. Raised by his mother (Sally Field) to not let the world hold
him back, she does the regrettable and sleeps with a school&#39;s principal
to get him enrolled. His first days are hard-luck, but that changes
when he lays eyes on the beautiful Jenny, and the two become close
friends, even through high school, when she is now played by Robin
Wright Penn. Once graduating high school, Forrest is encouraged to go
to college, where he becomes a football star and is drafted into the
United States Army upon graduation. Forrest&#39;s limited intelligence to
the situation renders him blind to the Vietnam conflict, where his
service is guaranteed. He&#39;s unaware of the growing resentment towards
the war, but his heroic actions to save comrades including hardened
veteran Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) and best friend Bubba (Mykelti
Williamson) during an ambush by the VC one day encourage a Medal of
Honor award. Thus, the world as we know it is seen through the eyes of
this simple man who leads an extraordinary journey through some of
America&#39;s roughest periods: the 1960s through the late &#39;70s. All of
this is fickle to him, as his one true love Jenny continues to evade
him (even though they see one another sporadically over the years, and
their encounters are often very brief) and her life becomes increasing
less than pleasant. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is one of the best movies for a
reason: when all hell was breaking loose during radical times of
change, one man saw it as a little more than nothing. His unwitting
triumphs over the years - football star, war hero, Medal of Honor
recipient, White House honorary guest, millionaire businessman,
international Ping Pong champion, and ultimately, father - are
extraordinary to everybody else except him, simply because he&#39;s too
stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Directed by Robert
Zemeckis, everything about &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is classic and beautiful.
From Hanks&#39;s brilliant and nuanced performance, to the Oscar-winning
special effects (the insertion of Hanks into archival media footage;
the digital erasure of Sinise&#39;s legs to make the audience believe he&#39;s
a real amputee) to the closing credits, it shines and will forever
remain shining as a modern American classic piece of cinema. Though
Forrest himself may not know it, he&#39;s found one of the greatest fans in
this writer. He&#39;s a true inspiration that nothing is impossible
regardless of one&#39;s intelligence. His message is that nothing can hold
you back except you. It&#39;s a dream come true from anyone&#39;s perspective.<br /><br />10/10
