There's some weird people writin' reviews about this movie.  I'd like to
know how many of these reviewers 'know' how it's so easy to act, quote,
retarded.  Obviously these people have no acting experience whatsoever,
because that, along with acting drunk and psychotic, are some of the
absolute hardest things to do without looking ridiculous and cartoonish. 
Why so much vitriol about a simple movie with a good, decent guy as the
protagonist?  Man, lighten up people!  Learn to enjoy the simpler things in
life!
