1998_September 11 

Forrest Gump is one of the best films Tom Hanks has done. In this 1994 film
his portrayal of Forrest recaptures the sprit of his classic performance in
Big (1988).
The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse
turning in performances that deserved Oscars.
Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young
Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R. Hall who plays
Young Jenny will probably forever be associated with the line &quot;Run Forrest
Run!&quot;)<br /><br />In conclusion, a film which given time to mature will be a classic.
