I was chided for not having seen this film...now I can chide back. I really
shouldn't be writing about it since I DID NOT see the whole thing. Yes, I
had to turn the DVD off after an agonizing hour. What a &quot;cute&quot; movie, but
that's all it is. And to think academy voters chose this stupid, egotistic
film over Shawshank Redemption. It's a sign that Hanks has way too much
academy pull. Great actor but the film comes up short. Don't be chided into
renting this thing.
