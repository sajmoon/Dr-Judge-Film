Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies and I love it because it's the
story of a compassionate man who doesn't have a high I.Q. but is an example
to all of us.  He cares about others and proves that to be good at heart is
much more valuable than being very smart.
I have given a vote of 10 points to this wonderful movie.
