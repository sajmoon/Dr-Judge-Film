I just recently saw this film and I gotta say, it had to be one of the
best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen! This film has everything you could want in
a film, humor, sadness, drama, action, etc. The actors were fantastic,
especially Tom Hanks, who&#x27;s performance is one of the best ever. This
film also explores a short glimpse of the horror and loss of friends in
the infamous Vietnam War, which just added to the film&#x27;s greatness.
Overall, Mr. Zemeckiz has created a film that will live inside
everyone&#x27;s hearts for the years to come. I have never, nor ever will,
see a more emotional, gripping, and inspirational film than Forrest
Gump!
