This is a very good film, but not great.  I think that after seeing it over
and over again it isn't all it's cracked-up to be.  Tom Hanks is a good
actor, but why did he win the Oscar?  I think the Academy just wanted to
make history with a consecutive Oscar win again.  He did deserve the Oscar
for &quot;Philadelphia&quot; though.  The basic facts are if you like Hanks watch
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; or &quot;Big&quot;.  If you like Sally Field watch &quot;Norma Rae&quot;.  If you
like Sinese and Wright though watch this one.
