Forrest Gump, Jenny Curan, Bubba Blue, Lt. Dan Taylor, and Momma Gump.
Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curan, Mykelti
Williamson as Bubba, Gary Sinsie as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Sally Field as
Momma Gump. This movie is spectacular. For 2 hours and 21 minutes I
enjoyed myself watching Forrest Gump. This movie is truly a classic in
my book with most of the phrazies. RUN FORREST RUN, LIFE IS LIKE A BOX
OF CHOCOLATES. This movie is a mix of drama and comedy. Forrest Gump is
a movie to watch almost everyday. After seeing how Jenny treats him who
would think about her anymore seriously. She completely treats him bad
and he still loves her.
