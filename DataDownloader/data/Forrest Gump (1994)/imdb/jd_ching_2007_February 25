There&#39;s absolutely no doubt this is just a masterpiece. Tom Hanks is a
genius, and a incredible actor(my favorite one). The simplicity of a
man is take to a whole new level. I just think this is one of the best
movies ever.<br /><br />The Script is flawless, incredible, the way it takes U.S.A history and
adapt it to a simple mentally retarded man of the south it&#39;s just
overwhelming. The story is great, and it&#39;s so powerful it can take you
to a whole new level of identifying with the character.<br /><br />Tom Hanks make one of the best if not the bes performance I&#39;ve ever
seen. and Liuetenant Dan it&#39;s another great actor. Incredible strong
acting, I love also the photography. Probably one of the most flawless
movies ever.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is definitively one of my (if not my) favorite movie of
all time, it is emotionally very powerful. Very Complex and not easy
going and very well done. Flawless performances I just love it. It&#39;s
one of those classics that always stays in your mind. I give it a 20
out of 10
