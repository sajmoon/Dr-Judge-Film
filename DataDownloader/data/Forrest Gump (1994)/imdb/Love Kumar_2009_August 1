Some movies are not to be rated because those are the movies which
defines movies. <br /><br />Entire story of movie is summarized in this one line which tom hanks
says simply somewhere in middle of movie. &#x22;I am not the smart man. But
I know what love is.&#x22;<br /><br />Tom hanks at its best of all performance. Not stupid but less smart
than others. He is best in everything but he never do anything for
himself. He proves to be a best son, best soldier, best sportsman, best
shrimper, best runner, best father and at all times, a true lover. <br /><br />Tom will give his best in everything while maintaining his simplicity
and innocence which gives you a smile every time with moisture in eyes.
One of the rare movie which can make you smile and cry at same time.<br /><br />Nothing needs to be said for this movie. Oscar defines it all. Don&#x27;t
care about ratings and watch this masterpiece.
