This is one of the most uplifting and moving movies in modern cinematic
history. I absolutely loved it. How could you not love this movie. We
have Forrest Gump, not the smartest guy on the world, with an I.Q.
below average, yet we see the world through his eyes. And he is in many
imortant world events, e.g., the Vietnam war, meeting the president and
so on and so forth. And he has influenced many people to follow their
dreams. I have seen this movie so many times, and it is one of my all
time favourites. Easily Tom Hanks&#x27; best film role. And Hands off to
Gary Sinise for his role as Lieutenant Dan. Forrest Gump is a very fine
piece of filmmaking.
