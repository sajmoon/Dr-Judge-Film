The movie Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zmeckis and written by
Winston Groom, is a fascinating film with a lot of great themes. It was
released in 1994 with a great actor, Tom Hanks playing the main
character Forrest Gump. It won six Academy Awards, which proves that
many people liked the film.<br /><br />This story is set in a very small fictional town in Alabama, which
presents the whole world. It is a microcosm of the world. The filmmaker
wanted viewers to empathize with Forrest. He wanted us to know how
stupid it is to judge people by intelligence and appearances. This film
has a very long time setting, from the late 1950s to the late 80s, to
show the growth of America and its loss of innocence, in modern times. <br /><br />Winston Groom presented the characters in a very interesting way by
using some of the characters surrealistically but some very
realistically. Forrest Gump, who is played by Tom Hanks in the film, is
presented as an &quot;everyman&quot;. He is used surrealistically and is a
character that is used symbolically. This has a universal appeal. His
story applies to every single one of us. <br /><br />Forrest Gump was born in a small town in Alabama as an idiot, and had
an IQ of 70, which is low compared to &quot;normal&quot; kids. He is judged upon
intelligence and appearances, but some of the things he says actually
have deep meanings. Tom Hanks was perfectly cast. His gestures, face
expressions, and the way he talked made the character seem alive and
very realistic. Sally Fields, who played Mrs. Gump, did a great job
presenting the determination of the mother&#39;s character. She is a very
realistic character. Mrs. Gump is willing to do anything for her son.
She is very protective and she didn&#39;t want Forrest to go to a special
school, so she even slept with the Principal of a school to make him
allow Forrest to go to that school. Jenny, who is played by a wonderful
actress Robin Wright, is also a realistic character. She was the only
child who was nice to him in school, and that&#39;s why Forrest falls in
love with her. When she was young, her father physically but also
sexually abused her. Jenny&#39;s dad symbolizes bad fatherhood, whereas
Mrs. Gump symbolizes good motherhood. Jenny has a lot of
disappointments in her life and also tries to commit suicide, which
shows how parenting is important and can ruin one&#39;s life. Lt. Dan is a
super realistic character that Forrest meets during the Vietnam War.
During the war he loses both legs and nearly dies, but Forrest saves
his life. Forrest helped Lt. Dan not give up his life, but start a new
fresh life catching fresh shrimps together. They start up a shrimp
company and make a lot of money. This develops the theme of true
friendship.<br /><br />There are many other themes in this story, such as determination,
tolerance, and parenting. But I think there are two very clear and
important themes. &quot;Life is a like a box of chocolates&quot; is one famous
Forrest Gump quotations. This quote hints us one of the theme of this
story. It sounds unintelligent, because he is holding a box of
chocolates and says it while he&#39;s taking one out and eating it, but if
you think about it, it has a very deep meaning. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s
going to come up in your life, just like you don&#39;t know what kind of
chocolate might come out. Life&#39;s unexpected. But is it really just
destiny, or can life be chosen? The quote, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot;
tells us another important theme. It&#39;s telling us not to judge by
appearances or intelligence. Winston Groom is giving us a very
important lesson: judge on actions, not reputation.<br /><br />Overall, the casting and acting of the actors, and each of the four
story elements were well presented. The setting and the idea of the
universal theme were very well developed. Also, the idea of Winston
Groom to present the characters both realistically and surrealistically
was brilliant. I think that this movie is very effective and it has
messages that teach people a lot of things. Forrest Gump is a movie
that everyone definitely should see.
