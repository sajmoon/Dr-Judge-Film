I&#39;ve seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and
Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.<br /><br />This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or
the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like
it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still
gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For
example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the
movie? It&#39;ll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)<br /><br />Just the fact that we&#39;ve seen it at least half a dozen times says a
lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. <br /><br />Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see
it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually
just looking for the most &quot;action,&quot; gore and sex they can find, and
haven&#39;t a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and
life.<br /><br />Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of
=truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific
aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it
as well.<br /><br />See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some
more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest
-- ever made.
