&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is one of best movies I have ever seen! I remember seeing it
in theaters and now I own it on DVD. The story tells us about the life of
Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow-witted but a good-hearted man from the
mid-1950s to the early-1980s who falls in love with his childhood best
friend Jenny (Robin Wright) who finds the ability to run fast takes him
places. As a football player, he met President John F. Kennedy, as a soldier
in Vietnam he was a war hero, and as a ping-pong player he met President
Richard Nixon. Later, becoming a shrimp-boat captain, he still yearns for
the love of his life, who takes quite a different path in life. &quot;Forrest
Gump&quot; is a movie that won 6 well-deserved Academy Awards including Best
Picture, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, and Best Director for Robert Zemeckis.
Excellent!<br /><br />10/10 stars!
