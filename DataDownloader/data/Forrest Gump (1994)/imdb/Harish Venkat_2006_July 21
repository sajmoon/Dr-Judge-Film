Forest Gump is a movie which will have an impact on you every time you
watch it. First time when i watched this movie long time after it was
released i could not imagine that a movie can be even made like this.
Hats off to the director and to my favorite actor Tom Hanks.<br /><br />I had watched Tom hanks movies before watching Forest gump but he
became my favorite only after watching FG. His expressions are
immaculate,inimitable and mesmerizing. I don&#39;t believe that anyone who
has watched this movie says that this movie hasn&#39;t moved them a bit.
This movie will remain in my list of few top movies. Every time you
start to watch this movie, you always want to watch it until the end.
That is magic of this movie. You have to watch Forest gump to believe
these comments. You can be rest assured that the movie will match or
exceed your expectations.<br /><br />Harish Venkat
