Ever have that one film that you&#x27;ve been getting bothered to watch, and
just because you haven&#x27;t seen it people feel the need to hate you and
bash you? Or maybe it&#x27;s just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me
for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for
people to understand. It&#x27;s something only I understand.<br /><br />My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much
about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets
annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and
when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to
Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the
above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when
people started verbally insulting me saying &#x22;I&#x27;m not a real critic&#x22; and
&#x22;You can&#x27;t call yourself a critic if you haven&#x27;t seen the masterpiece
that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said &#x22;OK! I&#x27;ll watch it!&#x22; The plot
I won&#x27;t waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE
knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an
IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to
strangers while waiting for a bus. Can&#x27;t get more simplistic than that.<br /><br />Forrest Gump has been called by people &#x22;a masterpiece&#x22; and &#x22;a classic.&#x22;
While I think it&#x27;s a well made film, I don&#x27;t think it deserved six
Oscars. I also don&#x27;t think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the
face for not seeing this film. It wasn&#x27;t truly amazing. In fact, no
film is really &#x22;amazing.&#x22; Even the favorite film I don&#x27;t call amazing.
When defining &#x22;amazing&#x22; you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s definition is &#x22;surprising
greatly.&#x22; I&#x27;ve seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an
&#x22;amazing&#x22; job teaching. The film I&#x27;m waiting to define &#x22;amazing&#x22; has
not been found.<br /><br />The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best
Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved
Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing.
That&#x27;s about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a
Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for
Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked
Shawshank better than Gump.<br /><br />As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the
story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play
Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to
so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think
&#x22;Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?&#x22; One category Forrest
Gump should&#x27;ve won for is &#x22;Best Musical Score.&#x22; The film includes the
catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It&#x27;s
definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found
myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd
Skynyrd&#x27;s iconic &#x22;Free Bird&#x22; which was used to perfection in this film.<br /><br />Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild
mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army,
and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable
character. Not an amazing character.<br /><br />My final thoughts on &#x22;the greatest movie ever&#x22; go as followed; it was a
damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest
film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the
shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review
this film I would&#x27;ve enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn&#x27;t annoy me
so much to review it I would&#x27;ve enjoyed more of what it had to offer.
The damage is done. I bet even after I&#x27;m done with this review people
will say I didn&#x27;t do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for
them; s**t happens.<br /><br />Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and
Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.
