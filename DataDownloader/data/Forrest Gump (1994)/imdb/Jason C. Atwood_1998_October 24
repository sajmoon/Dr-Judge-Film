1998_October 24 

Call me CRAZY! I usually get to view tons of good cheap movies in my
lifetime, but that's not always what I see. Every once in a while, I'll also
see a film the the entire American public has enjoyed and disliked through the
years gone by. Among those is FORREST GUMP, which proved Tom Hanks as an
acclaimed dramatic actor. The tale of a young man living through the life
and times is among the many landmarks existing in cinema today. No one
understood that the nostalgic visuals and props (plus the legless Gary
Sinise) were actually real and not copied or duplicated, meaning an Oscar
winner. It is both funny, serious, and heartbreaking for one entire movie,
but it isn't labeled as a &quot;comedy&quot; like many have called it. The film
greatly shows Hanks maturity after his comical heydays, and it continues on.
It also shows the way past generations of time are reborn in this present,
but disillusioned era. FORREST GUMP is a bona fide genuine classic that will
stick around in future generations to come. I ADMIT IT!<br /><br />
