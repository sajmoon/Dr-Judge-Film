FORREST GUMP is a perfect example of how books are much better than movies
in some cases. The book was funny. This was not. The book was sardonic,
satiric and ironic. This was not. And just because it won all those Oscars
doesn't make it the movie of the year. Driving Miss Daisy, Dances With
Wolves, Chariots of Fire and Titanic were all Best Picture winners, and if
you ask me were all given too much credit. In the future, no one will
remember FORREST GUMP. They'll just remember that somewhere along the way
a
movie fooled them into believing it was something more than what it really
was: An overlong movie making fun of retarded people.
