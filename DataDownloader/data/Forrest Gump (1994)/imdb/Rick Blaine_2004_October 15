The hype said this movie would change you forever. The movie is unique
in that it evokes laughter and tears at the same time and you feel both
swelling up inside you and you literally honestly really don't know
which will win out and come out first.<br /><br />The trivia section for this movie is ripe with clues that some people
don't seem to get - but without getting them it's a mystery what people
see in the movie. That a song called Blowin' in the Wind was written by
Bob Dylan but the performer in the movie uses the stage name Bobbie
Dylan - would this scene have any value, make any sense, if we didn't
know that? It's clear that to some nuggets like this were pure
revelation.<br /><br />As a keeper it's weak. You start to see where the story line is 'just a
bit too thin', but this is the second Oscar in a row for Hanks (after
Philadelphia) and no offense to the easily offended Hoffman, but this
one takes a lot more work and talent than tilting one's head to the
side and insisting there are 246 toothpicks on the floor when you
really don't have a clue.<br /><br />Was released twice in the same year and cleaned up both times; won six
of its possible thirteen Oscars; Hans Zimmer is good and his music was
no exception in The Lion King, but it's a shame one can't give awards
to all who are deserving: Silvestri's work on this one is some of the
best of the past ten years.
