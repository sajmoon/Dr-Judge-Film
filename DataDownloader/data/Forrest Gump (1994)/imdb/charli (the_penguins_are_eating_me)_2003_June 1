2003_June 1 

This film that touches the heart and soul of every viewer, with its blend
of
patriotic and racial issues that prove what a biased society we live in.
Tom
Hanks sand the other actors made the film not only believeable but you
feel
a part of the historical events covered. To anyone who has not experienced
the pleasure that comes from watching &quot;Forest Gump&quot; i say i give you a
whole
new view on life. This film is a truely historic event in itself.
