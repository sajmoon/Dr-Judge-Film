1998_December 13 

I was surprised to find so many others who held the same opinion as I about
the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  The nation laughed and cried along with Forrest
throughout the course of the movie and through pure visceral emotion,
resulted in Academy Awards out the wazoo.  If this movie evoked any kind of
response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of pure boredom.  I
was disappointed in the ridiculousness of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, a lot of the
reason being because I hold Tom Hanks in such high regard and never once
thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream
theory.  It completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards
and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and absolutely unrealistic.
The braces bursting from Forrest's legs, his unintentional football
scholarship to college, his meeting the president (and might I add his only
words to Mr. Kennedy were &quot;I have to go pee&quot;), his millions earned through
ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for &quot;no
reason at all&quot;, his &quot;inventing&quot; the happy face symbol by wiping his face on
a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The
movie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be
overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of heart.  Very touching, but
dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as
entertainment and will not derive motivation to make something of
themselves.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job and is convincing as a
mentally-challenged man, but the movie as a whole, the supposed &quot;story-line&quot;
and non-existent plot are pathetic and hold no ground.  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;
deserved no awards in my opinion.
