After reading some of the disgusting reviews of this film, i feel that
to insult such a brilliant masterpiece is disgraceful. this movie has
touched me in a way that no other movie has. it 110% completely
deserves the awards it received. tom hanks gives one of his greatest
performances in this film, and the way the story is brought together is
absolutely brilliant. anyone who says this movie is bad, has probably
been watching the wrong film!<br /><br />in all i feel this movie is truly among the greats of our time. the
simplicity of this movie makes it truly remarkable. if you have not
seen it yet then get of your seat and run down the DVD shop and buy!
you will not regret it.
