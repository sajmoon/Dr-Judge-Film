In all fairness and all clich&eacute;s and preachy political statements aside,
Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level. <br /><br />If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then
director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character
throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of
eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all
supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack. <br /><br />However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and
sometimes you don&#39;t even have to--you see the many issues that the film
attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it
really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution,
racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various
stages of Forest&#39;s life as he experiences them like the innocent child
that he is. <br /><br />The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and
perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that
Zemeckis takes in the film. <br /><br />Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest
makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won&#39;t take
drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind.
The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with
AIDS.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#39;m simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its
preachy optimism and &#39;fine-and-dandy&#39; attitude. Either way, this film
is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable. <br /><br />6/10
