This movie touches me in many ways. He goes from the love of his mother
to the love of his life. He &quot;Gumps&quot; his way through life and finds
himself in lots of life's great events. It makes me feel as though I
have done and seen a lot of what Forrest has done and seen. I must say
that I have &quot;Gumped&quot; a lot in my life and been there to see history. I
am a navy veteran and was there when the Marines were blown up in
Beruit in 1983. I was standing outside Buckingham Palace when President
Ronald Reagan came up and pulled into the main gates as I was saluting
his limousine. I was sightseeing in the courtyard of the Vatican on
Christmas day 1984, when Pope John Paul opened a high window and
blessed us all in the courtyard with his Christmas blessing. I was
aboard ship in the Gulf of Lybia, when Momar Kadafi called on his
people to kill all Americans and to blow up my ship, the U.S.S. Dwight
D. Eisenhower. So I have &quot;Gumped&quot; around a bit. I also have the love of
my life, although her name is Lori.
