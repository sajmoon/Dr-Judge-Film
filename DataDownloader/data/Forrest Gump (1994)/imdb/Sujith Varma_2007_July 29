One of the best movies I have ever seen - It made me realize truth and
innocence still lives. The love he had was pure. I cried watching this
movie. Also the way in which the story goes -the political element in
it -very accurate and nice. Also every character in this film<br /><br />100/100 for the director and story writer - Not to mention the
extraordinary legend Tom Hanks....Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary
Sinise, Mykelti Williamson - every one has played their part
beautifully.<br /><br />If U haven&#39;t seen this movie - you are missing one of the greatest
movie ever made....
