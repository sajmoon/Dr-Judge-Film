This movie manages to get the idea of the book and some of the episodes, but
completely misses the tone, which was dark and cynical. Imagine Candide
being made into a Lifetime movie and you get the idea.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is fine (although actors get a little too much credit for playing
mentally-challenged individuals - a bigger challenge would be Einstein,
Leonardo, or like Tom Hulce, Amadeus Mozart). <br /><br />Some of the better, more fantastic parts of the book are completely left
out. One in particular involves Forrest's being stranded on a Pacific island
following the crash of his spacecraft (he is an Astrophysics savant).
Would've been great. This movie cried out for a director like Terry Gilliam,
but it got hackmaster Z. Oh well. It wouldn't hurt so much if it hadn't won
best picture and best actor(!?!?!).
