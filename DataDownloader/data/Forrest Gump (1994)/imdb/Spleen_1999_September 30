1999_September 30 

The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four
Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'.  ANY
ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was
probably `Quiz Show').  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'.  I
took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every undeserved success and
wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal
affront.  It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just
too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates
art.<br /><br />Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity,
an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue.  Gump is as innocent as
they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The
trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not,
for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the
appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going
on.  (If only a bomb had landed on his foot.  It would have knocked some of
that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very
least.)<br /><br />The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump
canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often
the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend
five minutes with.<br /><br />`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.
