As you hear the wonderful music playing while the camera is following the
feather in the first scene, you will realize that you are watching a great
movie. Packed with great directing, acting, music and editing, Forrest
Gump
can be considered a film-making wonder.<br /><br />Tom Hanks brings Forrest Gump to life in one of the most incredible
performance I have ever seen. Add that to the lovable story and
breath-taking visuals and special effects, Forrest Gump will hold you from
beginning to end.<br /><br />But what really makes Forrest Gump great is the performance of Robin
Wright-Penn an Jenny. When Forrest is with her, the audience will feel
joy.
When Forrest misses her, the audience will also miss her and feel sad. And
after the movie is finished, Forrest and Jenny will still be in your head.
And in my case, it will be forever.
