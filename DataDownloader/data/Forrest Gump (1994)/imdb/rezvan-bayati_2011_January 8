America as the country which is always on the &#x22;move&#x22;, the land of
freedom, growth; these are the core ideas for many Hollywood movies.
The movie Forrest Gump can be considered as one of these movies.it has
got some elements of American identity. The story of a man who is
intellectually and mentally under grown and underdeveloped but he
appears to be appropriate and rightful in the works in his world. He
becomes an icon and hits the press all over the country. His dreams
turn to reality and this shows that your imaginings will come true if
you try hard enough and at the same time if you are well equipped to
freshness and honesty. Surprisingly, he visits three presidents,
Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He receives honors and makes
accomplishments in table tennis, shrimp industry, Vietnam War. A
&#x22;simple&#x22; man from Alabama who travels around the world &#x22;runs&#x22; across
America and meets political, cultural figures like Mao and John Lenon
as well. The amazing point that makes the main character of the film,
Forrest Gump, lovable and believable is that he keeps his childhood
innocence into maturity probably because he is not very smart; his IQ
is 75 below the normal point which is 80. On the other hand he remains
as a child in mind and soul even though he is physically grown. This
can be drawn in the picture which he shows his wounded buttock to the
President Johnson in the White House while he is receiving his Medal of
Honor. This is the indication for his simplicity. He firmly believes in
three things God, his mother and his lifelong love, Jenny, which
remembers her all the time. Although the movie keeps eye on Gump&#x27;s life
career but mainly it is depicting different periods of American
history. For example, it shows scenes from racial discrimination,
Vietnam War, Kennedy Assassination, Watergate scandal and so on. In
some cases it&#x27;s hard to distinguish clearly what the genre the movie
is, whether it is drama, romance or a satire. It can be argued that the
director skillfully amalgamated comedy, drama and documentary into each
other. Technically speaking, the movie is a flashback and a narrative
mode in which the movie starts from showing the viewers that Gump is
sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. At the same time, he tells the
story of his life to different people waiting for the shuttle bus. His
story is the tale of the nation and the country and even generally the
world as well. Visually impressive, the makers could successfully have
put Gump in scenes with the US presidents. Even they could have made it
possible to hear from Kennedy in Footballers&#x27; visit at the White House.
Due to this technicality and specialty it won the Academy Award for the
Best Visual Effects in 1994. The movie is ranked as the 71st of the
best motion picture of the all time by (AFI) American Film Institute.
Gump&#x27;s capability to be in the right place at the right time makes him
exceptional, too. He saves the lives of the American troops in Vietnam
War while he was looking for his intimate friend Buba. Once He ran like
a wind into the football field and he made part of his life career as a
footballer star by being too fast in the matches. He is the one who
calls the police and apprises them the weird condition in the hotel
which was the lead to disclose the Watergate scandal that led to the
resignation of Nixon. His simplicity and honesty is playing a key role
in all these situations. Despite being not &#x22;normal&#x22; as the doctor and
headmaster tell to Gump&#x27; mother in the beginning but he makes a very
successful life career which makes him well known and much more
generous and giving .The lessons that Gump are given by his mother are
very simple but very helpful. One of them is faith and believes in
destiny. To do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be
faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and &#x22;live&#x22;
with your &#x22;life&#x22;. The main message of the movie can be &#x22;when there is a
will, there is a way.&#x22; And as the British people put forward &#x22;Honesty
is the best policy.&#x22; These two are as the secret to happiness which
Gump finds it in his life. Other than that his life is inspiring for
many such as Lt. Dan Taylor and even Jenny who accuses Gump that &#x22;you
don&#x27;t know what love is&#x22; but finally backs and returns to the &#x22;kind but
slow-witted&#x22; man to make her own life much more &#x22;meaningful&#x22; and
cheerful. She even gave birth to a child and named him &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22;;
a new generation but with the old and respected values and beliefs.
Forrest Gump&#x27;s tale and world is ours, too; with too many ebbs and
flows; with sorrows and joys; with defeats and victories. But the tool
and rule to overcome the difficulties is simple; to be honest and
hopeful. He is exceptional mentally but not morally. His morals help
him to make the &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; an icon in the movie and in the real
world as well.
