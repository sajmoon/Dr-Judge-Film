Dont get me wrong this is a good movie but it is way overrated. Sure, it has
Great performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise but It just didnt do as much
for me as it did for other people. It has a pretty good script and pretty
well directed but the movie is too long and can get a little boring. Overall
I give it an 8 out of 10. Its a good movie, just not one of my
favorites.
