I know many people who have gone to see movies and fail to grasp what is
certainly the underlying subtleties the writers, producers and actors are
trying to convey. I read the derisive comments on this movie and realize
the
impossibility of helping these people see what they are blind to. They
look
at 'Forrest Gump' and think &quot;a movie about a guy who was not too bright
and
stumbled through life with great luck&quot;, they watch 'A Field of Dreams' and
think it is a movie about baseball.....
&lt;&lt;SIGH&gt;&gt; Some of us just have to be smacked in the head with
it
I guess. And please, don't think I subscribe to the new-age physco-babble
sensitivity training induced brain-damaged politically-corrected point of
view.
Gump, and movies such as it, are not meant to be pulled apart
scene-by-scene. They are works in full and as such can only be truly
understood when viewed as that. Works that try to show lifes experiences
and
the journey that is life are often hard to tolerate, much less understand
if
we become so hardened and cynical the we see only the entertainment value
in
them.
It is like going to the La Boheme and seeing only a sad story about poor
people, or going to see a Ballet and remembering only that you saw some
people dancing about. I you get it, nobody need explain it to you, if you
do
not get it, no amount of explanation will ever make it
clear.
