the very touching story about Forrest Gump is in my eyes the best motion
picture ever by 4 reasons.<br /><br />1. the story about Forrest journey down through the centuries is a
wonderful
story with loneliness, happiness and sadness. I dont think that any other
movie can top that.<br /><br />2. tom hanks - this is his best part ever. i normally dont like hanks very
much but this time i just cant say anything else than he was perfect in
the
part. only a young robert de niro could have done it this good, and
perhaps
not even him.<br /><br />3. the music - alan silvestris scores big time this time with his music.
what more is there to say.<br /><br />4. gary sinise - my all-time favourite actor had his big breakthrough in
this movie the same year as he did the mini-serie &quot;the stand&quot; and he was
this year nominated for the oscar fo this part. he is perfect as dan
taylor
and i think that he should have won the oscar.<br /><br />
