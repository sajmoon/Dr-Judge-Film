I was wondering if anyone else noticed that when they were kids, in the
field behind HER house when her dad was hunting for her, she prayed
&quot;god make me a bird so I can fly far, far away.&quot;(as birds did fly away)
Then when he found her singing naked at the bar and they were on the
bridge she asked him &quot;do you think I could fly if I jumped?&quot; Then when
she was ready to dive off the hotel balcony, the song Free Bird by
skynnard was playing and at the end when he was walking away from her
grave, he paused for a moment and watched the birds land in the tree
above her. The symbolism of her trying to always get away and find
peace and freedom only happened when she died and was laid to rest. By
the way, the soundtrack cd for sale for that movie had every song on it
but Free Bird.
