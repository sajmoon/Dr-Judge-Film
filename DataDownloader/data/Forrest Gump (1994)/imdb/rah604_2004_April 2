This oscar-winning film chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a
man of lower than average intelligence.  To give away the plot would take
away from the magic of the film.  Let's just say Forrest Gump takes place in
a variety of historical events and leads an extraordinary life.  And, in
spite of all his accomplishments, Gump's childhood sweetheart, Jenny (Robin
Wright Penn) continues to elude him.<br /><br />All of the actors shine in 'Gump', especially Robin Wright Penn, as Jenny,
and Gary Sinise, as an army lieutenant whose legs are amputated, both give
tender and heartfelt performances.  But Hanks steals the show, in what is
arguably the best performance of his career.  Hanks is excellent in
portraying a man who is unable to understand the hypocritical and unjust
nature of society. But acting is not the only thing that makes this movie
remarkable. 'Forrest Gump' is just simply film-making at its finest.<br /><br />Rating: (10/10)
