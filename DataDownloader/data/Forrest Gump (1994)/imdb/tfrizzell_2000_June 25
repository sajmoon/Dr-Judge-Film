&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six
Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance
consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved
with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. 
Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love
Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson),
and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated
performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing
visual effects and editing techniques.  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is an outstanding
achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great
and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six
years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a
household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was
hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best
film of 1994 and, with the exception of &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, may be the best
and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture
Oscar over &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; just adds to the
greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5.
