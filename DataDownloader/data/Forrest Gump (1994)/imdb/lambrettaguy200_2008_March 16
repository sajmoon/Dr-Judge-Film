2008_March 16 
I won&#39;t try to write any summary of this film as others here have done
this far better than I can.<br /><br />This is without doubt one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I
know that may not mean the same to someone else. I am not ashamed to
say this, but as I sit and write this now, there is a tear running down
my cheek but being in a public place right now, am trying not to let it
take over ! Just thinking of the scenes, the music, gets to me in a way
that other films have not. The storyline and the acting, especially Tom
Hanks, refreshes me and has me wishing for the meek and gentle to
inherit the Earth. In the past, a handful of films could do this to
me:- one is Wonderful Life, another is The Killing Fields and you may
laugh here - Mr Magoo&#39;s Christmas Carol !!! Forrest Gump is more than a
film experience, it&#39;s a lesson in life and humility. I&#39;m not very
religious, so maybe I have seen in this film the equivalent of a
parable.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what caused this film to be so magical - it just is.
