I know so many people who think Forrest Gump is a bad movie. They thought it
didn't deserve all those Oscars and how it could be in the top 10 grossing
films of all-time. However, let's look at the movie Forrest Gump. It's a
biography of a fictional character who, despite an I.Q. of lower than 80,
achieves so many awe inspiring things. He becomes an All-American running
back, he goes to Vietnam, saves several lives, and wins a Medal of Honor for
it. He becomes an amazing table tennis player and wins the International
championship. He buys a shrimp boat and in a short time monopolizes the
industry. He runs around the United States in three years. He marries his
childhood sweetheart and has a son. Quite an accomplished life. The story is
told with such beautiful narration by Forrest himself, and we see all the
amazing things that have happened in his short life. That is the beauty of
this movie, we get to see the entire life of a mentally challenged man, and
what a life it is! <br /><br />The visual effects are also amazing with Tom Hanks spliced into old video
footage from American history. Hanks delivers one of the greatest
performances ever in film and won an Oscar for it, one year after winning
Best Actor for Philadelphia. The movie won Best Picture of 1994 and was
ranked 71 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies of the last 100 Years. I was blown
away by everything in this movie, and, if what people say is true about all
the hype with a shallow movie attached, then I'm a victim of that. An epic
masterpiece. 10/10.
