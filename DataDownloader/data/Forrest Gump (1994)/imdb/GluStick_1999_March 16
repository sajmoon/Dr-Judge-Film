1999_March 16 

This movie was well acted and a little sad toward the end. It seemed like a
movie either liked or disliked by people. I for one liked it. It's neat how
they edit Tom Hanks in almost every major event from the 50's to the 80's.
It's not really a movie about special effects but it manages to squeeze some
in. I think what caught most people's eyes was that we understood Hanks. We
could relate to his grief and rise to intelligence. For me, this will remain
one of the greatest movies of all time. For others, sorry but you'll have to
wait for another movie that touches your heart with gentle hands.
