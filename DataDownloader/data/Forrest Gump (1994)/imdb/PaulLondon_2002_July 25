I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it had
improved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance!
The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically the
film is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sickly
and insubstantial. <br /><br />In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents of
social change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If it
wasn&#39;t so nauseating it would be funny. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars,
when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly and
morally bankrupt its a disgrace.<br /><br />Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book &quot;Vietnam War Movies&quot; wrote;
&quot;Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worrying
is that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give this
evil little film a U certificate. How can we protect our children
against such insidious brainwashing&quot; How accurate an insight.
