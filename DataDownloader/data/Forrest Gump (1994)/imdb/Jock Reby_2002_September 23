You've got to give it to the makers of this film, they certainly tried
every
trick in the book to wheedle reactions from viewers.  A person with a
disability who manages to triumph through the most extreme and traumatic
situations thrown at him.  Was this meant to be some sort of metaphor for
&quot;the American Dream&quot;, whereby citizens by rights should triumph through
whatever adversity is thrown their way, coming out the other side richer
and
stronger?  Give me a break - or at least, show it to me in an intelligent,
thoughtful, non-manipulative way!<br /><br />The scenes with Forrest intercut into historic footage were quite nice,
though.<br /><br />
