This movie is one of Tom Hanks best performances. Here, Forrest Gump
(Hanks) tells his life, having a low IQ and meeting his love interest
Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). It chronicles Gump&#39;s experiences by chance
with some of the most important people and events in America like
meeting with Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and
serving during the Vietnam War. Ulimately, he achieves what many other
people of higher IQ didn&#39;t, including being honorably discharged from
the military and receiving a medal. He leads a practically healthy and
successful lifestyle, and it is beautifully depicted here in this
movie, with superb acting, heartwarming events, hopeful music and
awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which
provides some comedy-relief to the stressing times of Vietnam-era
1960s.<br /><br />In this film, Forrest touched the lives of many people, and does so
with innocence and humility, without any idea what he is really
achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, he pursues goodness and success in
life by helping others and being a football star, while rejecting drugs
and all that bad crap. This is also a heroic film where Forrest Gump
saves the life of fellow soldiers, including Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary
Sinise), who at first condemned Gump from saving him because he wounded
up having both his legs amputated. Later, it turns out he lead a
recovered life afterward, walking on artificial legs and getting
married. And, the part where it showed Forrest Gump running non-stop
around the country for 3 years gave us a feeling that you should just
let go of your worries, and strive for the best, for the sky is the
limit.<br /><br />This is another day in the life about a man with a low IQ, but he sure
strives as depicted in this story. It is fun to see Forrest trying
endlessly to win Jenny&#39;s heart, and he still treats her well even
though she is not interested in him. <br /><br />Overall, it is a very sweet, powerful, innocent and hopeful film. One
of the best in cinema history, and surely worth is Oscar wins. <br /><br />So, life is sure like a box of chocolates. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;ll
gonna get.<br /><br />Grade A
