Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) discusses his relative level of intelligence with a
stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his subnormal IQ, Gump leads a
truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable
events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying,
Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a college football star,
meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson,
speaks at an antiwar rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the
Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard
Nixon, discovers the break in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping
business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to
run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the
remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets his true love
Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), who makes her own journey through the turbulence
of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest
happens upon. Also included in this are Sally Field as Forrest's mother;
Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his
ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe were you can use
shrimp. Forrest Gump is an American classic, very interesting and awesome
story and a little better than the top 250 ranking it got.
