Forrest Gump is a bad, bad movie.  It is an idiot going around falling
backwards into heroism, fortune, and friendship in a very unrealistic
fashion.  It has no importance to society whatsoever. It adds nothing to
one's personal enlightenment and does not make you think in the least.  I
suppose it is supposed to be a &quot;feel good&quot; film but it is too long and
boring to be that.  The fact that it has gotten so much praise
notwithstanding  winning Best Picture just makes me hate this film even
more.  If it is a feel good movie, let it be a feel good movie, but don't
try to pass it off as some monument of film making and give it the same
award as Schindler's List received and Saving Private Ryan got screwed out
of.  This movie is as retarded as Forrest himself is.
