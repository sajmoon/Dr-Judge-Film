Forrest Gump is a masterpiece. Watching the
remarkable life of a simple man woven through
the tapestry of recent American history makes
this film among my favorites. Tom Hanks is 
totally believable in the title role, and
Robin Wright &amp; Gary Sinise are both great.
What really makes this movie stand out though
is the way Forrest's life is inserted into so
many historic events...George Wallace trying
to stop integration in Little Rock, Vietnam
protests in Washington D.C., and (my favorite)
the Watergate break-in are among them. The use
of digital effects in archival footage is done
better than I have seen it before. A great story,
filmed superbly, and filled with great acting,
this is as good as it gets. 10 out of 10!
