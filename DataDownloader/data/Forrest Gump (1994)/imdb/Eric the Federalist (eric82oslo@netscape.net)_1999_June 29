1999_June 29 

Some things in the life can't compares to other similar things. You have
the
US' position in the world, Mahatma Gandhi's position as an idol &amp;
marvellous
human being &amp; from 1994 also Forrest Gump. I'm sure we're not going to see
any as good or better movie in the future, at least we've not seen it yet!
