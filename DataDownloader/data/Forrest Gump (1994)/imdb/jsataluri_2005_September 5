RUN FORREST RUN!! will always remain the catchphrase for this movie. We
all know he ran like a maniac and when he went, he went and he did not
stop at all. But the film is not only about the running scenes; it is
the world according to Gump and it&#39;s a hell of a world out there.<br /><br />Alabama born, low IQ, Jenny/mama loving and running man, young
protagonist Forrest Gump just lives an ordinary life. He doesn&#39;t know
what is going on; he lives his life to his fullest. But, along the way,
he has some natural experiences that impact his life; you can see
bullies tormenting him, him meeting Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan, his
experiences in Vietnam, saving all his fellow soldiers including Lt.
Dan, fulfilling Bubba&#39;s dream when he becomes shrimp captain of his
boat, when he played ping-pong, when he met President Kennedy, Johnson
and Nixon, when he got a Medal of Honor, his adventures with Lt. Dan,
his mama&#39;s advice and of course his love for Jenny. This film will
remain a masterpiece, not only for the running scenes, but for the true
humanity Forrest has in himself.<br /><br />Tom Hanks gives another fine performance (second to Philadelphia) as
Forrest, showing us that even retards can have some value in the world
and truly deserving his second Oscar. The supporting cast is excellent;
Gary Sinise with his breakthrough Oscar-nominated role as Lt. Dan, 2
time Oscar winner Sally Field as his mother, Mykelti Williamson (also
another breakthrough performance) as Bubba, and of course Robin Wright
Penn as Jenny, Forrest Gump&#39;s love who eludes him for many years until
the end. This film proves that care will help find one&#39;s destiny. And
Forrest does exactly that; he cares for everybody; he has no enemies
and he eventually achieves his destiny as just being himself. <br /><br />As the usual fan I am of Tom Hanks, I recommend this movie to everyone
and rank it a 10/10! MUST WATCH!
