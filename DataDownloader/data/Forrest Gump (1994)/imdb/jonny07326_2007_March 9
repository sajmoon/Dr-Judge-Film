I agree with most of the IMDb&#39;s top 250 list, but two things have
puzzled me. One of them is the fact that Forrest Gump is currently #81
on the list, and a movie that wasn&#39;t bad, but not nearly as good as
this called Fight Club, was #31! The other thing was that Forrest Gump
was so low on the top 250 list. I think it should be in the top 20,
right up there with Goodfellas, but it&#39;s not!! Tom Hanks basically had
a star turning role in this film. It&#39;s one of his best performances to
date and he didn&#39;t even make the top 20? The movie was a mixture of
comedy and drama, something that is so hard to do and seldomly keeps
the story in place, but Forrest Gump did. This was brilliantly casted
and very well directed.
