1999_April 20 

A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The
uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly
misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's
&quot;Zelig&quot;, the title character involves himself in all of the most famous
events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest
movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently
Gump-invented slogan: &quot;S**t happens&quot;. Why create a hero who celebrates
stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American
patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by
the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective
level,  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly
borrow (or makes a very conspicuous &quot;homage&quot;) from such masterpieces as
&quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax,
it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it
pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his
&quot;stupid&quot; adventures.
