I think this film is magical . It's got almost everything you could expect
from an epic film ; comedy , drama , satire , philosophy , one-liners ,
quotes , action and even a bit of suspense . The magical thing about
Forrest
Gump is that its storylines are unconventional and it is life affirming .
Few of my friends think likewise . Forrest Gump is heart-warming and
spiritually uplifting in another words .<br /><br />Technically , Forrest Gump is a perfect motion picture . The
cinematography
, the music score and script are ones of the best , if not the best . And
the special effect and sound are the best I have seen . Immaculately done
computer generated graphics are totally genuinely looking and even
unbelievable today . It deserved all the 13 nominations it garnered
although
it got only six as it competed with many strong entries in technical
fields
( musical , art direction , cinematography and etc ) .<br /><br />I totally hate Pulp Fiction which many people here prefer over Forrest
Gump
because it's such a pointlessly violent film which makes foul language
sound
cool . The Shawsank Redemption is a fine film but not as great as many
people have claimed . In any light , Forrest Gump is a classic , a box
office success ,  award recognizing film that has a place in American Film
Institute Top 100 films of all time .<br /><br />
