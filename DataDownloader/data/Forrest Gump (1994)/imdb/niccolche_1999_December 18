Who couldn't love Forrest Gump? A lovable &quot;Local Idiot&quot; ends up making
&quot;more
money than Davy Crocket&quot;, and proves to everyone that &quot;stupid is as stupid
does&quot;. This movie is my DAILY inspiration (literally, i think that i need a
new copy), and should be classified as a classic. Not only are the
characters lovable, but it's extremely well done also. Very creative and
very unique. And that's all i have to say about that.
