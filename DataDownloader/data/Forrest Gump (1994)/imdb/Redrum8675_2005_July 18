Forest Gump is personally my favorite movie of all time. Not only does
it portray the inspirational story of a &quot;slow&quot; man's life, but it also
shows one of the most important times in our nation's history. Forest
Gump is an outstanding movie with exceptional acting by Tom Hanks and
Sally Field. Robert Zemekis blends human emotions with friendship in
this timeless tale. Forest Gump is also a hilarious movie with many
jokes and laughs for the whole family. Many people would say it is not
appropriate for small children, but I beg to differ. Forest Gump is one
of those movie you SHOULD show your kids to give them a taste of what
it was like when you were a kid.<br /><br />Two Thumbs Way Up!!!
