The high school football scene was filmed with players from Patrick
Henry Academy, Estill, SC. The team was bussed to Beaufort and spent
the day being filmed. I think the school received a check for $2,500
for using the boys for the day and the boys got the thrill of being in
a movie. <br /><br />My law partner&#39;s son, McKenzie Solomons threw the ball shown in the
film and my son, Trip Lawton was one of the backs protecting the
quarterback. I&#39;ve never seen any credit for the schools participation
in this great film classic. <br /><br />I noticed that USC&#39;s band got a credit for their participation. Does
anyone know the &quot;rules&quot; for credits in a film? I wouldn&#39;t think the
individual boys would have been named, but it does look like the school
would have been recognized for its contribution.
