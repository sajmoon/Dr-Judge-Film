  I know my one line summary might not be that clear so I'm going to explain
it to you.  In  1994, we had classics like &quot;The Shawshank redemption&quot; and
&quot;Pulp fiction&quot; who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every
category in which they were nominated.  They were all stolen by &quot;Forrest
Gump&quot;.  These two other movies which were completely different in their
style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them
were completely over-looked.  And the worst part is &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is simply
the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best actor
category.  Of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill
but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it
well.<br /><br />  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West
Alabama.  However, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for
which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to school, he is rejected
by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day
after school, while Forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are
surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at
Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get
away.  This is the classic scene when Jenny yells &quot;Run Forrest, run.&quot; and as
he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are
unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have
bikes.<br /><br />  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) go their own way.
 Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp,
all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest
gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.  Further on during the
war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but
loses his best friend Bubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because
of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the butt.  When
Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to
Bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat.  Another
thing he does is try to find Jenny.<br /><br />  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good.  But I still don't
think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks) and
best director (Robert Zemeckis) at the Oscars. I mean, if it had really
deserved those Oscars, wouldn't it get a higher rank than both &quot;Pulp
fiction&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank redemption&quot; on our top 250 list?  I actually
believe that the one who deserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the
movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.  However, it was almost
impossible for him to win that year because we had Martin Landau in
nomination for best supporting actor in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; and he truly deserved the
Oscar he won.  So all in all, this isn't a bad movie, it's just way too
over-rated.
