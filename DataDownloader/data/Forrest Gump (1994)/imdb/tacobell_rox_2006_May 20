I was stunned to see so many people spitting fury out here, against
this movie. I&#39;m assuming that most of them are &#39;liberals&#39; who are
offended by the &#39;conservative&#39; message of the movie. I find it very
funny because I thought being a liberal meant ... well, being liberal.<br /><br />I must also admit that I&#39;m not an American myself, and so may be
missing a lot of hidden messages from the film maker. But still, so
much hatred and anger is very surprising. That&#39;s why I found the film
so refreshing. The guy is so simple, uncomplicated and a pleasure to be
with. I speak from personal experience because someone very close to me
is retarded.
