2004_May 1 

I can't believe this insultingly stupid, trite, and flabby film was
nominated for any awards. The film is simply meaningless, having no
comprehensible point of view and unwilling to look one millimeter past the
surface of any of the events it attempts to depict. Something like this is
even more flatulent and offensive than action garbage like _ConAir_, which
at least doesn't pretend to have Something To Say.<br /><br />The popularity of this movie escapes me completely. I guess it makes people
feel good about themselves in some sick way: &quot;My life is bad, but lookie -
this retarded man gets to interpret the highlights of American history and
popular culture for me!&quot; Hanks, who I normally like, seems to have based his
performance on not blinking, or maybe he was just drugged (a rational
response to the uber Hallmark Card that passes for a screenplay.) Wretched
garbage appropriate for people scared of thinking.
