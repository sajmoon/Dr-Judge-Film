Simply amazing.  Let me start out my saying Tom Hanks was incredible as the
title role, and he deserved the Oscar more than anyone else.  Good job Tom! 
Also, the historical aspects, thought, special effects, music, direction,
and emotions brought to the screen were very well done.  A lot of people
don't like this.  I wonder why.  They are probably the same crowd who
thought American Beauty sucked, so, obviously, they wouldn't know a good
movie if it kicked them in their dumb-asses.  Maybe Forrest Gump's accent or
stupidity brought it down for them.  Maybe they are prejudice against
mentally-challenged people, if so, shame on them.  But anyway, great
movie....one of the best.......ever.
