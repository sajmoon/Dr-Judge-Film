This film is well present and Tom Hanks brings 'Forest' to life.He brings
the sensitivity,courage and bravery out in his character.<br /><br />I love this film and know it almost word for word i can't seem to get
enough
of it.<br /><br />My favourit part would be when he finally gets married to jenny, although
i
was upset when she died from the cancer, in many respects i can relate to
this film alot and that's probably why i love it so much
