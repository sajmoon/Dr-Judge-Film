2002_January 10 

I love Tom Hanks, but the fact that film has enjoyed such popularity
seems to me to be a sign of the endless American thirst for the
milk of amnesia.  Anyone who cares about any of the historical
events &quot;depicted&quot; in this film -- especially the war in Vietnam --
ought to be offended.  Anyone from the south ought to be offended,
too, at the way Hanks' and others' southern accents are used as
signifiers of imbecility, and that imbecility then romanticized.  And
lastly, African-Americans ought to be outraged at the way Mykelti
Williamson -- a very fine actor, by the by -- is used to slip the worst
of stereotypes in under the &quot;comic&quot; door.  When we look back fifty
years from now, this will be the &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot; of its
day.<br /><br />#1 on my list of all-time worst films.
