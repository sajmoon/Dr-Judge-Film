Well to describe how I personally see this movie is hard, cause so many
aspects of it really are hard to describe in words... It&#x27;s really
something special to watch this guy who everyone said was a man with no
real future go trough life in a way we could never expect, with such a
simple way to see things while people around him seem to have a hard
time simply living... That&#x27;s where the paradox of Jenny comes into
mind, where she seems to always want to find herself in a messed up
world, she always comes back to the only man who never saw her for
anything else than his best friend and the woman he loves... That is to
me the essence of this movie, the power of Forrest Gump is that
attraction, the feeling that you&#x27;re watching an epic adventure trough
the life of a simple man who never intended to be a great man but he
became one without even knowing it... He lived for the one he loved,
his mother, Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan... And Tom Hanks captured this
essence... I truly believe this is one of the greatest movie of all
time... Truly, perfection in simplicity...
