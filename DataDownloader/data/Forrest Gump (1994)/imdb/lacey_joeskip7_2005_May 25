When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I
think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just
recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving
meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of
it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an
innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning
of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on
life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let
the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us
trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to
just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we
all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that
feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who
hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest
seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...
