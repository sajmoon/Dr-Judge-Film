1999_July 2 

I suppose that because FORREST GUMP uses fantastic technology to trot out
its one joke and gimmick again, it gave the illusion of somehow being
original.  The feather and the feather only is great in this movie; the
rest
is capable at best (Hanks' performance, some of the cinematography) and
hackneyed at worst.  This is the sort of movie, like THE SOUND OF MUSIC,
which cues its sentiment so strongly it's insulting.  It's interesting to
take a movie like this and compare it with something like BIRDY (which has
certain thematic similarities); BIRDY's premise is so much more
far-fetched,
and yet the movie has an authenticity GUMP can't manage.  Almost everyone
involved here has done better, if not stellar, work elsewhere.
