&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; should have a higher rating than 10! It is cleverly
written and Tom Hanks plays his part really well.. I don't see why some
people hate it! Why else did it win 6 Oscars? Yes, 6!! This movie shows
that even if you don't have a plan in life, it'll always turn out how
it was intended by someone else (i.e God). It also shows that just
because someone is stupid - it doesn't mean they don't have feelings..
This is shown when Forrest falls in love with jenny. I totally
recommend this movie to anyone; it has romance, comedy, sadness and
happy times - all in one! What more could you want? Every single part
of this film is enjoyable - one minute its sad and brings a tear to
your eye - the next you're rolling on the floor with laughter!
