1998_November 1 

I usually judge a movie by the effect it has on me and how I generally feel
after watching it. To me, Forrest Gump ranks up there with Schindler's List.
There were a lot of memorable scenes in the film but the part I liked the
most is the part when Jenny is about to die and Forrest tells her of all the
things he experienced in Vietnam and his cross-country
hike.
Jenny tells him that it would have been nice to be with him during those
times. Forrest tells her, &quot;But you were, Jenny.&quot;
Corny? Maybe. But then again, not too many films can bring out human
emotions this film does.
