Forrest Gump is one of the movies that actually has a well-written plot.
Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) is waiting for the bus one day. He is
sort of dimwitted, as he has an iq of 75. But as people sit next to him at
the bus stop, he goes through so many events that happened through his life,
it makes you think that you were actually there with him. This film is
absolutely phenomenal. I saw this in 3rd hour English today and this film
just went and tugged at my heart strings. This movie was so realistic that
you could actually FEEL Forrest's sadness, joys, and even the adventures
that he went through in his life.<br /><br />This is one I definitely plan to see again.
