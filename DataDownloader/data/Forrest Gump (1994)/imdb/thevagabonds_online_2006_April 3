this is the greatest film of all time, i know all the words all the way
through, it is such a beautiful and emotional movie. i gets to me every
single time i watch it.<br /><br />tom hanks is the greatest actor i have ever seen, you really feel for
this guy, he never does anything stupid because he follows his heart
and always tries to do the right thing for the people he loves. that is
an important message we can all learn from in this modern age of war.<br /><br />this movie will change your life. buy and love it<br /><br />it is a great insight into the history of America, i myself being from
England find it ultimately attractive to watch American culture being
laid out and intertwined for are view pleasure.
