Despite the title, it's not the story of Forrest Gump, blank slate; it's a
story told by Forrest Gump, clear mirror.  And the story he reflects is of
America and its journey through the late 20th century, its failings and
its
growth. It isn't a totally glorious story.  Nor is it the story of
wealthy,
clever people (and their shrinks) from the cities - that's for the Woody
Allens of the world, and their admittedly important and valuable studies
of
interior worlds.  This is an expansive survey of what makes America what
it
is.  Zemeckis's answer is the nearest thing to Frank Capra's deeply
democratic concept of America as a collection of ordinary, not-too-bright,
people who are sometimes misled by their &quot;leaders&quot;, sometimes beguiled
into
temptation, who make mistakes but collectively stumble and fumble to a
generally benign destination guided by wisdom and good intentions that few
of them possess consistently as individuals but which comprise the
collective sum of their histories.
Tom Hanks must be a genius to play the Everyman, Mr America.  It seemed to
be the role Dennis Weaver was destined for after Duel; it's the role
Dennis
Hopper achieved once in Easy Rider; it's the role Gary Cooper and James
Stewart filled in Capra's films; but none of them had to carry quite so
much
of a film as Hanks does here.
