Forrest Gump is touching to the melodramatic and sensitive.  Problem is,
Robert Zemeckis is more concerned about glossing over the moments that
viewers would find objectionable in order to make it more of a
&quot;happy-family-safe-crowd-pleasing-money-maker&quot;.  With Back to the Future and
Death Becomes Her he wasn't as concerned about that, hence they were better
movies.<br /><br />Such moments as drug addiction, exploitation, PTSD, the horrors of Vietnam,
and the tirade of political violence that flows through the movie are done
more for laughs or extracting faux-sentimental emotion from the audience
rather than any actual history lesson in the works.  I can only imagine how
Terry Gilliam or Oliver Stone of all people would have handled
this.<br /><br />On the technical level, Forrest Gump is a trip.  As Zemeckis said, &quot;It's not
trying to wow you&quot; and it doesn't.  CGI is used here the way it was supposed
to, as a supporting element that enhances the experience.  The editing is
also pretty good, many scenes flow into each other effectively and create
interesting parallels.  Zemeckis also is finally concerned about what he
puts on the screen, thus the cinematography is far better than anything else
he previously did.  Hanks' performance is certainly inferior compared to
Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  What was the Academy
thinking?<br /><br />While some may wax nostalgia about the passage of time from the 50s to the
early 90s in American history, I will try to be supportive of the fact that
the film keeps moving.  Unfortunately, the message (and hence the purpose)
of the movie is constantly hammered at the audience in a fashion that
celebrates foolishness.  How uninventive from a Hollywood &quot;whiz
kid&quot;.<br /><br />Overall, halfway decent, albeit sugarcoated, film.  If you want real
history, watch Schindler's List instead.  3 out of 5 stars.
