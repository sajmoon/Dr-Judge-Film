No doubt about it this is a Wonderful movie. This is my favorite movie
of all time. You see the main point of this movie was the amazing story
of a young man who cared about only three things. His momma, Jenny, and
God. Without those three things he wasn't Forest Gump. Forest teaches
the values of being a person. He teaches u that you can achieve so much
in life even with a low IQ. What makes this movie so amazing is that he
accidentally occurred in big events in U.S. history. And he didn't even
know it. That is my favorite part of the whole movie. I believe Forest
Gump changed a lot of us in so many ways you can't even explain. After
watching this movie I feel so good inside and appreciate life more than
I already do. That's what Forest Gump did.
