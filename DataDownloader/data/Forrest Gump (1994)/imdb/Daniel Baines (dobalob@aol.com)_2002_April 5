I'm afraid that this film probably wouldn't have bothered me quite so much
if it had been significantly shorter. I tend to forget boring,
over-sentimental stuff if it isn't also seemingly interminable.<br /><br />It took me a long time after this film to be able to watch some of the
better Tom Hanks films and actually appreciate them (The Green Mile,
Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan etc)<br /><br />As The Princess Bride was one of my all-time favourite films, I expected
better of Robyn Wright, but no-one could have saved a film with such an
inappropriate message
