Alright, so, the movie was quite a touching story of a mentally disabled man
telling his life story at a bus stop to whoever will sit next to him and
listen. I guess, in a way, it goes to show that life can be full or
surprises, in many ways.<br /><br />But, the thing I don't think I liked very much about the movie was the way
it seemed like Forest had nothing but blind luck all of his life. I mean, it
was to the point of being comical. I only &quot;wish&quot; I had a life filled with
the blind luck like Forest seemed to suffer from, as I am sure many other
people do.<br /><br />But -- one thing remains true -- and it was said many times thru the movie
and has become an icon for all to remember the movie by --- life is like a
box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.
