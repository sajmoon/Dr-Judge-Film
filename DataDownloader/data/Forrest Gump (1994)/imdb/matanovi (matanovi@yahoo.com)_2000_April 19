I have never seen a screenplay that can measure up to Eric Roth's screenplay
of `Forrest Gump' in it's original structure, intelligence and unique
approach to life analysis and its treatment, and the direction so powerful,
expert and spectacular in a major Hollywood motion picture like Robert
Zemeckis's in this one.<br /><br />I have also never seen a film so complete and deep, never seen a dream
fantasy presented on the screen so successfully, never seen a human being so
special as Forrest is, and never felt a movie experience that was so moving
and touching. It's a fictious character and a fictious plot, but if I
haven't known that, I would have said that I believe that the film is based
on a true story with a few adaptions and plot point changes. Eventhough
Forrest goes through the most unplausible situations one can go through.<br /><br />I doubt that anyone will observe life the same way after seeing this movie.
A lot of them will say that the movie was stupid and overdone, but deep
inside they'll remember it forever. The promotional tagline of the movie
truly is the point of it and its message. That's what the creators
accomplished, and in such an unexpected and unique way that you really start
to wonder was the quality of this movie maybe reached by a complete
accident. The tagline and the feather prove that it wasn't.<br /><br />I find `Forrest Gump' original, intelligent, wise, sly, balanced, complex,
heartwarming, unbelievably dynamic, witty in one-of-a-kind manner, endlessly
touching and enchanting, extraordinary and magical. And, for that matter,
one of the best American motion pictures in the history of filmmaking.
