I was put off from watching Forrest Gump for a long while by the excessive
hype and praise it received, especially at the Academy Awards. I felt that it
(like Titanic last year) just couldn't be deserving of all those awards.<br /><br />I still agree with countless others here that it didn't deserve all those
awards in the face of the great competition it faced, but after seeing it
for the first time a couple of years ago I think that Forrest Gump is a
great film, and (unlike Titanic) it has a lot of depth to it, provides much
to be enjoyed, and stands up well to repeated viewing.<br /><br />It will never compete with something like The Shawshank Redemption in my
eyes, but few films do. With some films it's just best to sit back and enjoy
the way it looks, and the way it makes you feel, this is one of
them.
