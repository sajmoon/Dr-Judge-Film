Implausible, unbelievably mawkish and sentimental, the high regard that
viewers and reviewers have had for this film baffles me. Nobody should be
forced to watch this trite and smug piece of film-making more than once,
apart from the writer responsible for the &quot;Life is like a box of
chocolates...&quot; line, who, if there is any justice will find himself stuck
in
hell watching it for all eternity.
