2008_March 4 
I must say that one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in the past ten years
has got to be Forrest Gump. The writing alone is more than anything
than I could have thought, even after hearing so many people quoting
the movie and Forrest. As far as acting goes, Tom did a wonderful job
as Forrest. However, I must admit that sometimes Forrest&#39;s narration
got slightly annoying. Nevertheless, all of the actors in the film did
a wonderful job. A particularly surprising performance by the Actress
that played Jenny sticks out in my mind.<br /><br />The editing was good, although I think it could have been slightly
shorter. But there isn&#39;t enough wrong with the editing to complain
about. The characters were all made to immediately grasp the audience&#39;s
attention, which is what happened moments after they were introduced.<br /><br />None of the music really sticks out, but it definitely wasn&#39;t anything
to complain about. The overall mood of the film, though, is what really
helps bring it together. I was half afraid I might let a tear slip
close to the end of the film; not really because Jenny dies, but more
because of how happy Forrest is just having the life that he does with
his son. And as he flashed back to the scenes on the boat, in Vietnam,
and his running as he looked at the different skies at different times
of day, I realized the beauty that the film makers were trying to
capture through the eyes of this slightly retarded man.<br /><br />All in all, I could really not ask for much better of a film.
