Forrest Gump is a film that I could watch over and over again and still
be moved, entertained, and inspired. It is the story of a simple man
that inexplicably becomes embroiled in extraordinary events. It is a
tale of remarkable coincidences and great emotional loss.<br /><br />Hanks is at his cinematic best here, creating a highly believable
character that one cannot help but love, despite his flaws. And how
about the supporting actors! Gary Sinise is brilliant as the often
reluctant friend to Gump. Robin Wright perfectly captures the love
interest that is a close yet very different person than Gump. Sally
Field is likable and endearing as the mother with boundless love for
her only child.<br /><br />The story is never boring, with events flowing seamlessly. There is a
story telling angle here with a narrative overlay is unique and serves
to accentuate major plot points. Most characters are recurring parts of
Gump&#39;s life, and they come and go throughout the film.<br /><br />Perhaps the most inspirational part of the film is the character of
Gump himself. Although simple, he has an astounding realization of
right and wrong, yet remains non-judgemental to those around him. He
suffers great emotional loss at several points throughout the film, yet
remains strong and carries on because he knows that he still has
obligations and that there are others whom might depend upon him in
some way.<br /><br />I have few criticisms about the movie. There were a few times where
Hanks slipped out of character a bit and reminded me more of his
typical comedic personality, but they were few and far between. I&#39;m
striving to think of more, but I just can&#39;t come up with any.<br /><br />Forrest Gump truly is an inspiring, heartwarming story that will
undoubteldy stand the test of time. It has a wide appeal, but this is
well deserved. Enjoy with my recommendations.
