  I really do love this movie a lot. Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise,
and Hanna Hall were all brilliant! This movie is about Forrest Gump (Tom
Hanks) telling the story of his life while waiting for a bus. Robert
Zemeckis directed the movie, and made it great! This is a wonderful movie! I
give Forrest Gump a 10 out of 10!!! :)
