I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this
movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of
1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite
movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump
(it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big'). <br /><br />Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought
that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his
best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan,
is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam
to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames
Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the
shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the
sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.<br /><br />Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness
(I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any
account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart
warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my
favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I
think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what
your about to watch. 10/10<br /><br />
