2001_March 22 

I remember the first three times that I watched this movie, I really
enjoyed
it.  Then I watched it with a classroom full of students and noticed when
everyone was laughing.  Everyone was laughing at the same joke over and
over
again.  Hey look, it's a retard doing retarded things; let's laugh at him.
Oh, and to make people not feel guilty about it we'll make Forrest's life
materially comfortable.  That this movie won oscars is an affront to the
shreds of decency that the Oscars have.  That this movie was passed off as
touching is wrong.  I loved Dumb and Dumber, and I see why I am not
offended
by it:  it does not feign depth or decency.  Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks
may have fooled us in 1994, but it's 7 years later, and still people don't
see this movie for what it is.
