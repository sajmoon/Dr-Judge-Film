This movie is by far the best movie I have ever viewed in my entire
life! Tom Hanks' stellar performance shocks everyone who sees this
movie, therefore it was not a surprise that he won best actor at the
Oscars for the 2nd time in a row for this movie. As well this movie
received best director (Rob Zemeckis) and best picture! Not only is the
acting and script excellent, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; also shows some of the best
camera techniques ever shown in a featured film.The movie gives a great
story, both dramatic, funny, and exciting. All in all, if you are one
of the few who have not yet seen this movie, than you should do so
right away because this movie not only has one of the best living
actors starring in it, it also has one of the best characters ever
created to star in a film. Kudos to the whole team who worked on this
memorable masterpiece!
