Goodness gracious, I discovered that I hadn't commented on this movie
yet! Well, it's to be rectified.<br /><br />Forrest Gump was an absolute favorite of mine for several years, it
still ranks among the top ten movies of all time. It is brilliant, a
true gem that will undoubtedly become a classic. It already IS a
classic, actually. At least in my book.<br /><br />Though it differs from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do
with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name Forrest Gump
and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: it's the kind
of epic and insane saga one can find in one. The life and adventures of
Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time
around, the liar tells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human
being, a bit on the slow side, I'll admit - but he is honest, he is
righteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.<br /><br />This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, it's
politics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets
between the events and actually understanding them is the kind of
distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His
ability to walk away unscathed from any happening is one I sure would
like to have.<br /><br />I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life.
