Tom Hanks portrays Forrest Gump, a simple-minded but charming man who
hails from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. Through the eyes of Forrest
Gump, we look at various moments throughout history, including a
realistic Vietnam War re-creation and a rather amusing one that refers
to the Watergate scandal.<br /><br />Sally Field plays his loving mother, and Robin Wright plays Jenny...the
girl he met as a boy and thinks about constantly no matter the
situation. Gary Sinise is Lt. Dan Taylor, who Forrest meets in Vietnam
and forms a relationship as the film progresses.<br /><br />A great cast is led by a terrific director, Robert Zemeckis. A tad
longer than it should be, but still a great film! It proves that you
don&#39;t have to be smart to find success in life...or even LIVE it.
