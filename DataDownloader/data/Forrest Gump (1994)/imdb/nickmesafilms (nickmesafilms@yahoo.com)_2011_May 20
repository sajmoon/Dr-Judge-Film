&#x22;Mama says &#x27;stupid is as stupid does&#x27;&#x22;. That was a quote from one of
the best movies of all time. &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is the story of a man from
Alabama with a low I.Q., whose personality is different from others,
but ends up achieving many goals including football, Vietnam,
shrimping, table tennis, etc. The story has words spoken by the
beautiful writing of Eric Roth, and it was magically directed by Robert
Zemeckis. The amazing visual effects were added to plant Tom Hanks in
historical landmarks, which makes that kind of movie, a magical movie.
The film had a brilliant cast involving Gary Sinise, Robin Wright,
Sally Field, and the incredible Tom Hanks as the witted Forrest,
himself. The movie was an incredible look of being different while
being special, and never knowing what to do in life cause it just
happens to you without knowing. That&#x27;s why I respect this excellent
film. Like my Mama always says, &#x22;life is like a box of chocolates, you
never know what you&#x27;re going to get&#x22;. You know what, Mama was right
about that! &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;A fantastic journey seen
through the human eye&#x22;.
