This film I watched for the first time when I was 8 years
old.
It had me rooted to my seat for the entirety of the picture and even
then
i knew that I would see anything that moved me so much.
It takes serious things and turns them into an educational, comical and
more dramatic version of history itself.
The film uses characters like Bubba and Forests drill seargent to really
take this film to new levels. Forest himself represents the naive child
looking at the world as an uneducated person without the real wisdom of
his
age group.
To watch this film as a child is probably the best thing that you can
do.
You feel almost as if you are forest instaed of just pitying him like most
people do. I think the point of the film is to show that through the eyes
of
a child the world, and whatever difficulties it is facing, really can seem
magical if you just look at things without the educated colour that we see
today. Forrest has an ability to look at things more plainly and more
black
and white that others do. I think that for this reason this film should be
the best film ever. After people have watched the film it has the impact
of
empathy on it's imeidiate audience so that for ten minutes after the film
everyone feels together and unified.
This film is the greatest film of all time and if you ask me it is
unquestionable.
