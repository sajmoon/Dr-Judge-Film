This is a truly patriotic movie, and guess what: not even half of
America probably likes it. It's got a dunce as the protagonist, who,
for sentimentality reasons talks slowly, he's got your typical,
advice-giving all-American mother, references to the Vietnam war and
America's greatness and, of course, an all to frequently appearing love
story.<br /><br />Yep, that's Forrest Gump.<br /><br />Coincidentilly appearing in many historical times, never funny (maybe
save the 'Watergate' incident) these soon tire. It's simply done too
many times, and each occurrence is as crap as the last. Many people
have stated this an 'entertaing, heartwarming tale'. Are you watching
the same film, with references to paedophilia, incest, war violence,
death, cancer and drug addiction, all through the eyes of a disabled
person. Heartwarming? <br /><br />Well, no. This film may have been entertaining were it not so sad. It's
got many occasions where you could watch happily. But everything bad in
the film you've seen at the times it could be entertaining stick with
you. The incest, the paedophilia, the drug use, the attempted suicide.
It sticks with you.<br /><br />Bad things happen to often in this film, and it's justified by Gump's
idiotic nature.<br /><br />I'll give it a ** out of **** for few moments of entertainment and
savour.
