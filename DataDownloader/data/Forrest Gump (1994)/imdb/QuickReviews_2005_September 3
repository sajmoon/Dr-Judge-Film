FORREST GUMP (1994) <br /><br />I don't think it is possible. Forrest Gump has to be one of the best
movies I've had the pleasure of seeing.<br /><br />There's not a lot of people like Forrest, so there's not a lot of
movies like Forrest Gump. The movie is about a man named Forrest
(played by Tom Hanks) whose IQ is a 75. In the movie, he shares his
life with people at a bus stop. He shares about all kinds of different
events that happened from the 1950's to the 1980's.<br /><br />This is not a story about a man who is mentally retarded. It is more of
a man who manges to get through life, despite all he's been through.<br /><br />Forrest was born in Alabama to a boardinghouse owner (played by Sally
Field). During his childhood, he is forced to wear leg braces to
correct his posture. When they finally fall off in his high school
years (during a chase by bullies in a pick-up truck) Forrest realizes
he can run like the wind.<br /><br />In his adult years, Forrest accomplishes so much. First, he joins the
military and is sent off to Vietnam, he becomes a ping-pong champion,
he becomes a shrimp boat captain (in memory of one of his military
buddies, Bubba), he becomes a millionaire stockholder for Apple
Computers and he runs across the country for no reason.<br /><br />The thing that impressed me most were the carefully-selected TV clips
and the voice dubbing. With these, director Robert Zemeckis was able to
create some hilarious moments throughout the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a must-see. Forrest Gump gets a well-deserved
10/10!
