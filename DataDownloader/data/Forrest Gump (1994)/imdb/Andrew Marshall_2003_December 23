This is possibly the most overrated film of recent times. The film follows
the fortunes of Forrest Gump. Forrest is simple, but manages to have an
impact on American history throughout the 50's, 60's and 70's. The film is
an American dream and yet something tells me that America is the least
likely place for Forrest to be a success. American culture is all about
conforming to the norm and Forrest simply wouldn't be tolerated in real
life.
