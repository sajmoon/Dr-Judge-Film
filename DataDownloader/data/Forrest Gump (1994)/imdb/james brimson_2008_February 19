I don&#39;t know Tom Hanks and the likelihood is i will never meet him.
However i would be very surprised if this film doesn&#39;t rate amongst his
best/favourite/one to be proud of when he is talking to his
grandchildren It is a timeless classic. i fully expect to be many a
persons favourite film of all time. There is nothing about this film
not to like, from the catchphrases, the audacious dips into world
history and celebrity, its cheeky nods towards serious issues such as
child abuse, racism, politics etc. The performances are superb, led
from the front by Hanks. I think Bubba is hysterical, Sally field was
an inspirational choice for the momma role, and lieutenant Dan nearly
steals the show, and would have done if Hanks hadn&#39;t absolutely nailed
it! THe best thing though about this film is its appeal, you can watch
it on DVD on a Monday but if you happened to find it on television in
the same week you would watch it again, and yes you would still be
saying the catchphrases at the end........My name is Forrest Gump,
people call me Forrest Gump.
