This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. Brilliant.
Tom Hanks gives one of his greatest performances and no one else could
have pulled it off the way he did. I believe anyone over the age of 14
should see this movie. I didn&#x27;t think it could be done. I came in with
average expectations and I came out in joy. There will never be another
movie like this again. Robert Zemeckis is one of the all time best
directors for this piece of magic. Thought Tom Hanks goes the extra
mile in this I have to give credit to the supporting roles in this
movie. This was Best Picture winner all the way and nothing could have
stopped it.
