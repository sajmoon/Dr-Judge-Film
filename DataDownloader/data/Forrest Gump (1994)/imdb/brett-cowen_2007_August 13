2007_August 13 
I&#39;ve resisted watching this over hyped lump of a film for many many
years, until this week when my step-son decided that he would inflict
it upon me, stating what a fantastic film it was (he&#39;s fourteen - he
knows no better!) <br /><br />This film bored me to tears.<br /><br />I cared for not one of the characters. <br /><br />The story was purile, like the characters and like a lot of Spielberg
films, it was long, tedious and everybody is suppose to say &quot;wow, what
a fantastic film&quot;. Well in my opinion, I can&#39;t see what all the fuss
was about.
