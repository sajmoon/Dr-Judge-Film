Forrest Gump has amazing trick photography and art design set to a
soundtrack of memorable hits, but that&#x27;s about it. This is the sort of
passive-aggressive Serious Movie where all the fun bits fall flat
because the message is constantly spelled-out in huge neon letters for
the mouth-breathers. Some of the cast do well but others are hobbled by
the clich&#xE9;d, one-dimensional writing. Robin Wright Penn comes off the
worst because her role might as well be called &#x27;Idealized Girlfriend
Too Blind To See What She Really Needs Is Right In Front Of Her&#x27;
instead of &#x27;Jenny&#x27;. She isn&#x27;t really a person, more like an incubator
with nice bone structure. Despite its calculatedly simple-minded air
this movie is quite poisonous as far as Jenny is concerned. All her
attempts to find herself are portrayed as failures but what was her
alternative? To place her life in another persons hands and hope they
know what they&#x27;re doing? Is that really a positive message? It&#x27;s
certainly a passive one, and somewhat un-American to boot, which makes
this movies popularity in the Red States even weirder. Forrest Gump
would have to be one of the most pretentious movies I have ever seen,
and I love how fans of the movie criticize those who dislike it by
accusing them of taking it too seriously, or being too analytical.
Don&#x27;t blame me, I&#x27;m not the one who showered it with Oscars. Remember
the TV ads at the time, the ones that proclaimed it a
&#x22;once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece&#x22;? The haters definitely didn&#x27;t
greenlight those. Underneath the cool effects Forrest Gump is really
just another smug, shallow, finger-wagging tract: &#x22;Do as you&#x27;re told
and be good to your Mother and everything will turn out just fine!&#x22;
