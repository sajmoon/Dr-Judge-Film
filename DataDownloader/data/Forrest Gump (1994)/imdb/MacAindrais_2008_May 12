Forrest Gump (1994) ****<br /><br />Forrest Gump is the sappiest of melodramas, but it is also a
wonderfully made and wonderfully touching film. Everyone of course
knows the plot of the film, so I won&#39;t bother discussing that. Robert
Zemeckis&#39; talents as a special effects filmmaker are astounding, and
the effects in Forrest Gump are no less than incredible. Such as the
scenes in which he meets a number of presidents in archival footage,
and his address of a peace rally in Washington. The film seems to have
either a love it or hate it following. What surprises me most though is
the extreme hate and overreading that some people have regarding the
film. Some critics have claimed that the film is &quot;mawkishly
conservative,&quot; and triumphs the idea that ignorance is bliss. The
biggest shame is that the film has been politicized - it is not
political, it is human. I am inclined to agree with Roger Ebert and
Gene Siskel&#39;s interpretation in suggesting that the movie is about how
America has never come to terms with its historical past, and is not
about neglecting things such as the Vietnam war. It is not about
following rules, or suggesting that if you&#39;re a hippie you will become
a drug addict or anything like that. The movie is simply about the
journey that life is. To politicize the film is to present an element
to the film which was never there to begin with. <br /><br />Forrest Gump is simply a story about humanity. I&#39;ve never understood
the &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; comments. The film has nothing to do with
that. Like the politicization of the film, so too is this an element
brought in by critics which was never part of the film. The picture is
about the reaffirmation of life. Forrest Gump is not a smart man, but
just because he is not smart does not mean that he cannot succeed in
life. This is a problem that i have with many liberal academics, and I
say this as a left wing academic myself, wherein uneducated or
unintellectual people are regarded as failures and placed on a pedestal
far lower than they place themselves upon. One does not need to be
intelligent to be enlightened, and enlightenment is not an intrinsic
characteristic of intelligence. Forrest Gump is a magical and touching
human dramedy. Take it for what it is, and what it is is a much smarter
film than people give it credit for. Its a wonderful movie, and its
shame that its been politicized because of its historical odysseys.
