how could the academy be so out of touch with the American public that
they believe this vile, uninspired piece of drivel, created solely to
appeal to the lowest common denominators stupid younger brother, was
worthy of not just one, but six Oscars? these were not insignificant
awards that this film took home either. how does best director, best
actor, best editor, best screenplay, and, oh, i don&#39;t know, best
picture!!!! are you kidding me? what, the student films from miss
o&#39;malley&#39;s sixth grade class weren&#39;t allowed to contend? of course,
they would have been too high-brow for the viewers who are allowed to
speak for the masses.
