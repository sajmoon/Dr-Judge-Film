**** Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Fields, Mykelti
Williamsin. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis again takes you to a
magical world of heart warming devotion and true human spirit as
Forrest Gump (Gentle Hanks) a slightly gifted man sees the world
through one magical experience after another.Through the heart of
Vietnam with Lt. Dan (Shining Sinise) and around the world to his
teenage sweetheart Jenny (Wright). Hanks leading this ensemble cast
that is one of the 90's greatest films and one of the most devoted
films and brilliantly written by Eric Roth based on the novel by
Winston Groom. Of course in the creative mind of Zemeckis the movie was
bound for greatness, and showing a Tim Burton like creativity
escalating to six academy awards (Best Picture non the less). My final
rating 10/10
