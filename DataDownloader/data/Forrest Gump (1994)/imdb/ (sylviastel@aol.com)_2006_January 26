When I hear the music, I think of how wonderful the world can truly be
if there were more Forrest Gumps out there. When the film came out, it
was truly breathtaking. It showed that the great and talented Tom Hanks
can perform anything. Had this film been released a year before? He
would have probably have gotten his first Academy Award for Best Actor.
Truthfully, his role in Philadelphia was good but not Forrest Gump. We
don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that
he played a Philadelphia attorney dying of AIDS and suing for justice
for his termination. While the film, Philadelphia is good. It's not
Forrest Gump. What separates Forrest Gump from Philadelphia is that
there is so much more going on around the character. I think it's a
shame that Sally Field did not get an Academy Award nomination for Best
Supporting Actress for playing his mother and Robin Wright also did not
get a nomination for Best Supporting ACtress for playing the love of
FOrrest's life. They were some of the best female performances of that
year alone. When you hear the music or the soundtrack, you are reminded
of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly
remarkable character named Forrest Gump. Gary Sinise was also worth
mentioning because he was nominated for BEst Supporting Actor as the
man's Vietnam comrade who he saved. That touching moment of when
Forrest realizes his gratitude for saving his life is still chilling
and touching and remarkable like the film.
