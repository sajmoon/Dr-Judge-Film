If they did't have Tom Hanks this movie woulden't have been made. Could
you
put Jim Carry in the place of Tom Hanks in this Movie? Well, you could but
then this movie would be terible. Or what about that Tom Cruze guy I don't
think that that guy could have pulled this movie off and make it as big of
a
hit as Tom Hanks. And every bad thing in this movie is some how turned
into
some thing good. For example, If Forrest wasen't so stupid those bullies
woulden't have chased after him and he wouldn't have learned to run so
fast.
and then he wouldn't have played football and if it wasen't for him being
so
fast he would have been killed in the war. So in conclution there is some
stupid parts in this movie but they are very funny and almost every thing
in
this movie that is looked at as a bad thing gets turned in to a good thing
that eventualy helps Forrest Gump.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9 out of 10
