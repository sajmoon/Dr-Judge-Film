Critics of Forest Gump like to talk about the Hollywood schmaltz that covers
the movie like frosting on a cake. The fact that Gump also came out at the
same time as Pulp Fiction and received more attention than Tarantino's gem
also tends to feed the fire of Gump opponents, who turn the situation into a
Gump vs. Pulp scenario, when in fact, both movies deserve all the credit
they can get. Gump is indeed hurt by the mainstream accolades bestowed upon
it, but that should not take away from the fact that it was an original
script that had some of the best acting you'll find. Few could argue that
Hanks was sensational. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright were also fantastic in
their roles as Lt. Dan and Jenny. And, anyone who has a heartbeat has to be
touched by Gump's innocence and the fact that his pure honesty and goodness
continually prevailed despite life's ugly turns.
