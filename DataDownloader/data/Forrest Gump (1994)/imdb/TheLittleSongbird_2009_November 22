Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but
there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny&#x27;s grave. The
cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is
gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to
the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is
simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to
be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as
impressive; whilst Tom Hanks&#x27;s accent is a little awkward in places, my
only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable
performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more
for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her
career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest&#x27;s mother. The
scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving
and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will
admit I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is
this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox
