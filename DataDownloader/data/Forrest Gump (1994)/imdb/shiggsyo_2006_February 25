In 1994, a mega hit movie came out. Millions of people went to see it
in theaters, and adored the lovable main character; Forrest Gump.
Forrest Gump later received six academy awards (including best picture
and actor), and was even ranked as one of the hundred best American
films of all time by the AFI. I pose a question to you, the reader; is
something wrong with me? Because Forrest Gump, in my eyes, is,
possibly, one of the hundred WORST movies that I've ever seen. Forrest
Gump boasts a FAIR performance by Tom Hanks, starring as the title
role. That, perhaps, is the best part of this movie, and it was only
par. In terms of the story, which could be the worst part of this
movie, it is completely pointless. It may be entertaining to watch,
but, in the end, it is two and a half hours of a retard (75 I.Q.)
prospering in life. This could be a really great movie, but there was
no struggle involved. Forrest Gump simply had life and all of his
achievements come rushing towards him. Forrest Gump advertises the idea
that you can just slide through life effortlessly; that is not true.
All in all, Forrest Gump is just a big, overrated disappointment.
