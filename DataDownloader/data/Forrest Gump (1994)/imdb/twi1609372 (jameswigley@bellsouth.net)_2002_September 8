have you ever watched a movie and at the end of the movie, you just couldn't
figure out why it was written? this happened to me when i saw forest Gump.
who writes a movie about a retarded guy who happens to be involved in every
major historical event in the 60's and 70's, what would inspire someone to
take such an undertaking. the movie is flat out stupid. the plot was silly,
the writing was absolutely horrible, the directing, reprehensible however, I
read some reviews which say this movie is about right wing politics, to the
contrary, the movie is all but right wing, in-fact it's quite liberal.
Nothing infuriates me like a horrible movie getting so much revere and
attention.
