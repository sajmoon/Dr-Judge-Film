Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.<br /><br />Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.<br /><br />I&#39;m not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me
cry when I watch a movie. Bambi&#39;s mother, I couldn&#39;t care less. Jimmy
Stewart in, &quot;Oh, what a wonderful life,&quot; - yeah right! The Lion King,
when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.<br /><br />But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in
this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to
perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney
was to win the Premiership in 2007.<br /><br />I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and
you&#39;ll see.
