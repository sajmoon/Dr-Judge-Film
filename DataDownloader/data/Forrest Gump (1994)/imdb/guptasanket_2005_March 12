If you are looking for an inspiration in form of a movie, Forrest Gump
is the one you have got to watch. It inspires you to work ahead when
the odds are stacked against you and one day you will conquer the
world. It is useless to check out the verity of the incidents that have
been mentioned in the movie, I think movie is about giving a message to
oneself about the virtues of being good and everything good will happen
to you. Tom Hanks is simply mind blowing in a movie which in essence
leaves a tinge of positive energy within you. This movie and Tom Hanks
deserve every bit of acclaim they have got through this movie. The
story is told in a way which teaches you a lesson of humility, even
though so many things happen to him he stays the same soft-spoken,
reluctant, Forrest he used to be during his childhood. And this movie
is not all about lessons, it is an emotion filled journey of a person
who faces adversity and comes out with flying colors out of those
adversities and as the caption tells us &quot;World will never be the same
once you see through the eyes of Forrest Gump&quot;. Well i think if a
person after seeing this movie, wants to be like Forrest Gump then i
guess the purpose of the movie has been served
