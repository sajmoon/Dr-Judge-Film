This is absolutely the best movie Tom Hanks has ever played. Here's a
man who low of intelligence, but high on life himself. He may have been
simple, but he wasn't narrow-minded which was the bright spot for
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. The three important people in his life come and gone:
Jenny, Forrest's friend from school, Bubba, an army buddy who lost his
life during the war, and his mom, a big impact to him. This movie had a
big cast, and the scenes are unforgettable. From the running scene
which Jenny shouts: &quot;Run Forrest, RUN!&quot; To the all-girls college dorm
room scene which I always shudder at. Forrest Gump may not have had a
lot of smarts, but he made a lot of difference to himself which he care
less to take notice of.<br /><br />This move is a true classic. I've enjoyed every bit of it! 10++! 5
STARS!
