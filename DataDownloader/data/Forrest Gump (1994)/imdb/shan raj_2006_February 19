if anyone says this movie is bad.... you can just ask them to watch
movies of aliens and predators and all those cgi trashes... or else,
not to watch anything at all. coz they don't deserve watching this kind
of movies. This one is strictly for lovers of good movies. When I first
saw it, I was attracted by the way Gump loves his girl. She tries to
drift away from him again and again, but his love makes her come back.
his love is unconditional. He didn't care what he gets back. He just
love the girl... thats it. Above all, tom hanks, gary sinise, and
others hv dished out magnificent performances. I hv watched the movie
again and i would recommend those who hvnt seen it to GO WATCH IT!!!
coz its worth. Moreover, its not just a good movie, its HIGHLY
entertaining and u can learn a lesson or two from watching it.
