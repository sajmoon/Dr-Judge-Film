2008_July 3 
It had been a little while since I watched Forrest Gump and it wasn&#39;t
but a few minutes before everything I loved about it came flooding back
and by the time the credits rolled and I had dried my tears I realized
that I think this is quite possibly the best film ever made. It may be
my favorite movie of all time and for good reason because it is stone
cold brilliant in every way and deserved everything from awards to box
office glory that it received. Previously I have stated that JFK is my
favorite film and in a complete league of it&#39;s own and now I state that
Forrest Gump belongs in that category of elite films. The story is
infamous and brilliant and touching and disturbing and covers every
aspect of genre you can think of. The cast is absolutely brilliant. The
direction is stunning and the special effects are unlike anything you
will ever see. Director Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director and has
directed his way through many of my personal all time favorites
including the Back To The Future Trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and
What Lies Beneath. The thing about his story telling is that it&#39;s
completely unique, there is something completely and utterly different
about his films and Forrest Gump is truly the pinnacle of that talent.
He seems to know his cast and surrounds himself with the best
performances possible.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor, there is no doubt about it. But he
gives the absolute performance of his career as Forrest Gump, a man who
is not quite as smart as the average person and yet pure of heart and
indeed in many ways smarter than all of us. Hanks makes this character
his own, no one could ever play Gump. His tone and body language and
everything just embodies the character and it is one of the best
performances in film history. Robin Wright Penn plays Forrest&#39;s true
love and the romance is far beyond just your average romance. Penn is
good although I&#39;m not sure she lives up to the rest of the cast. She
does do a great job at being versatile and playing her character
through the decades and through the different situations in history
from Southern girl to Hippie to mother. The chemistry between her and
Hanks is undeniable mostly because of the story that makes their love
so important to Gump. Gary Sinise is undeniably amazing in his role as
Lt Dan Taylor. I don&#39;t know who got the Academy Award that year in the
category he was nominated for but he was robbed!! His performance is
ground breaking and creates one of the best characters in film history.
Him and Hanks are just incredible together. Mykelti Williamson, in a
bit of a smaller role, is also brilliant as Bubba, Forrest&#39;s best good
friend in the army. His character is short lived but pivotal and he
does an amazing job. I wish I could cover the rest of this amazing cast
which includes Sally Field in an amazing role as Forrest&#39;s mama. This
cast is truly one of the best ever period.<br /><br />What else can I say about Forrest Gump? Beautiful romance, action,
drama, laughing, crying, life and death, I mean there isn&#39;t anything
this movie doesn&#39;t give you. It&#39;s just this brilliant epic journey that
just makes you appreciate life and tells history from a completely
different perspective. I&#39;ve seen this film many, many times and yet for
the last half hour of the movie I sat there and watched it bawling my
eyes out. It isn&#39;t many movies that ever make me cry and it is even
less that a movie I have seen so many times can do that. If you haven&#39;t
seen Forrest Gump you&#39;re missing out on a film experience unlike any
other and an absolute classic the minute it was released. I understand
they are looking at turning the second novel, a sequel, into a film and
because I want to revisit these characters I would love a chance to see
it but I don&#39;t think it could ever live up to this original classic and
if the entire original cast including director Robert Zemeckis won&#39;t do
it...DON&#39;T DO IT...see this movie now or again. 10+/10
