I thought this film was excellent. It was heartwarming, funny and sometimes
a little serious. Brilliant performances from Sinise, and especially Tom
Hanks makes this movie even better, BUT... it did not deserve the best
picture oscar. As good as it may be, it was not good enough. I would
recommend this movie to everyone, but don't take the film too seriously -
you might find it very stupid.
