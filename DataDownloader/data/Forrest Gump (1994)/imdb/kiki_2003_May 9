I saw Forrest Gump for film study recently which was my first time. It's
been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand
it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it
humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and
entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big
appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles
and as Forrest Gump he was extradinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his
movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail,
castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the
new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching.
But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything,
screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special
effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into
this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.<br /><br />So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites. I
recommend to anyone.
