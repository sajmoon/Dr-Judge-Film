This is a story of an unremarkable man, the ordinary guy, the kid you
always
made fun of in high school for taking special ed... this is the story of
that man finding happiness that many of us only seek. That someone can be
satisfied from the purity and simplicity of his life is truly amazing and
should be a lesson to us all.<br /><br />It's also a story of the differences between people, and how despite those
differences we can still connect. He shares his life story with strangers
while waiting for the bus, and he affects all of those characters in
different ways, just like this movie affected different viewers in
different
ways. Some of them disregard him as just the dumb guy waiting for the bus,
but some of them listen to him, most notably the older woman at the end
who
doesn't get on the bus because she truly wants to hear his
story.<br /><br />There are many other ways to perceive this story. You can see it as the
story of a man who loves a woman struggling between goodness and
immorality,
or as an essay on how people change over time, or even how ignorance can
breed contentment.<br /><br />But no matter what you see in this movie, you find that it's a
multi-faceted
study on life, and you see glimpses of yourself in the characters. It
reaches humans on every level - it makes us laugh, cry, contemplate... and
our hearts soar whenever something good happens.<br /><br />Hopefully you too will watch this movie and get one step closer to
figuring
out exactly who you are.
