I was ten years old when I first saw Forrest Gump. Seven years have gone by
and it still is  one of my favorite movies. After watching this movie I
started to watch Hollywood movies with more curiosity and fascination. The
role of Forrest Gump was portrayed brilliantly by Tom
Hanks (one of his best performances ever).
The director Robert Zemeckis has subtly shown us thirty years of American
history in three hours. This movie is an interesting way to learn about a
slice of American history. Though Forrest Gump is considered to have a low
I.Q.(which is evident from such dialogues as &quot;My name is Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.&quot;)he has a high E.Q.(emotional quotient). It is
the loving nature and innocence of his character that really appeals to me.
This movie gives us hope as it shows us the goodness of the human spirit.
Forrest Gump proves to many of us that that at times ignorance can be
bliss.
All in all it is one of the best feel good movies ever made as it really
tugs at the heart strings.
