This is a movie like no other. I was one of the most high acclaimed
movies of 1994. Takes place between 1950s-1982. Forrest Gump is an
Alabama man who may seem like just an ordinary fellow you&#39;d see on a
street.<br /><br />But he has a quite an interesting life. He wasn&#39;t the smartest kid at
school, took advice from his mother, and doesn&#39;t know his own destiny
just yet.<br /><br />Throughout the movie you&#39;ll see that Forrest has been part of history
as early as the mid 50s. He&#39;ll face many great opportunities, meet
famous celebrities, and finding out what was his own purpose in life.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is one of my many favorite movies. And probably one of the
best ones that Tom Hanks has ever done. The movie did a great job in
recreating each time period Forrest is in. And they did an excellent
job in visual effects and alternating footage of famous celebrities for
the film&#39;s story.<br /><br />I never read the original book, but this is one of those movies I can
see again and again. Tom Hanks fans will be very pleased with this
movie.
