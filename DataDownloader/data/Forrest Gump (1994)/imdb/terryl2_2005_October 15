this is one of the best movies ever made. it is completely re watchable
and its amazing every time. it also has the best soundtrack of any
movie ever. i love the way it is filmed. the historical content also
make this a grand example of truly great cinema and just what a good
writer, director, and cast can do when they work together and bring
something to the world. i cant even contain my excitement for this
movie and write a coherent post. its great its wonderful. see it over
and over and over. i really think that tom hanks and Gary sinese make
one of the most unexpected but best duet in a film of all time. they
are both brilliant men and work together seamlessly to create a
cohesive and magnificent story of two men with different handicaps and
the same problems, discrimination, the belief that they cant do it, and
the problem of how to prove that they can do it. hanks carries the role
of forest excellently just was he does later on in the castaway he
seems to have limited dialouge that would control his acting ability
but he finds so many other way to get around that and show you the real
forest. see this movie again.
