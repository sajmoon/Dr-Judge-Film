This is one of my favorite movies that I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s
heartwarming, beautiful, charming, funny, and just overall great. The
acting is superb, the story is excellent, and music is probably the
best I&#x27;ve ever heard. Mostly because of the genius song selection for
this movie. Every single song in this movie that you will hear(not
including the original score)will perfectly some up the 50&#x27;s - 90&#x27;s
era.<br /><br />A great thing about this movie is that the story centers around
historic events like Vietnam, Watergate, and even includes famous
people like JFK, LBJ, Elvis, and John Lennon. The movie perfectly
captures these famous moments and people through the eyes Forrest Gump
who simply was at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is an innocent tale about an innocent, loving man who gets
sucked into America&#x27;s history from the 1950&#x27;s - 1990&#x27;s. While going
through these important moments of America&#x27;s history, he is also trying
to be with the woman he loves, Jenny. Jenny is an interesting character
because her actions and her life are the exact opposite of Forrest&#x27;s.
Forrest is a person who wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly. He manages his life well,
works hard, and has family values which make him a great person and
therefore,the audience can easily fall in love with him. Jenny on other
hand, is a person who can&#x27;t seem to live her life. As a child she was
abused by her father, she got kicked of college for appearing in a
Playboy magazine, and her dream of becoming a country singer is pretty
much destroyed because in the 70&#x27;s she started taking drugs and the
entire time she&#x27;s being used or abused by every man that she meets,
except Forrest.<br /><br />Thats the beauty of the film. You want these two to get together.
You&#x27;re rooting for the characters. And that&#x27;s something hard to find in
movies.<br /><br />Forrest Gump still stands the test of time even though it&#x27;s already 15
years old. It&#x27;s a classic movie that I enjoy watching whenever it&#x27;s on
TV. It offers a great story complete with great acting. If you haven&#x27;t
seen this movie yet, then what the hell are you doing? Go watch it, I
guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.<br /><br />10/10 A+ all the way
