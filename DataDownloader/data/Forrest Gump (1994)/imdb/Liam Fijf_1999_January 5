1999_January 5 

I must admit I came close to tears while watching 'Forrest Gump'.  I nearly
cried when I realised I'd invested AUD$11 and a couple of hours of my life
on such an exceptionally worthless film.<br /><br />To pick up the thread from another viewer, this film dishes out a
puritanical (read: American) fable whose message is: if you're conservative,
straight and don't rock the boat, all will be well; but be outrageous,
rebellious and buck the system, you get AIDS and die.<br /><br />Very over-rated piece of hyped up shlock.
