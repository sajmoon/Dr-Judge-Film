Come on who would ever watch this movie it's totally impossible and not to
mention stupid.  First of all the army would never let a mentally retarded
person enlist, and second of all how is a person of his mental state
suppose
of graduated college?  The straw that broke the camals back for me was
when
the news reported on Gump's running across the country and they reffered
to
him just a gardner from Greenbow Alabama, when he was a college football
star, Medal of Honor winner, on the U.S. ping pong team, was on the cover
of
Fortune 500 (magazine), and sold his company to Macantosh for millions of
dollers, give me a break.  For this to win the acadamy award is an utter
joke.
