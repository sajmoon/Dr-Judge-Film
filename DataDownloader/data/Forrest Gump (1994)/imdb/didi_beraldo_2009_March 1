That&#39;s a kind of movie that we are only supposed to say: perfect, after
watching it. Tom Hanks is on his best role ever, the story keep your
eyes through the whole movie at the screen, Gary Sinise does a quite
good job and everything is good too. And what is worse: you want to
watch it again and again and again...<br /><br />Plus, you learn a lot about shrimp (hilarious) . Robert Zemeckis made a
story that if you read for the first time you&#39;ll think it&#39;s another
boring story of simply a man and his weird history, away beyond that.
It&#39;s about of everyone life. It a review of us, human beings on Earth.
It&#39;s complex and simple at the same time.<br /><br />Oh my god, simply perfect. What else can I say?
