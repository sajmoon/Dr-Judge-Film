Forrest Gump is simply amazing. It is one of my favourite movies of all
time. It is inspiring. It is by far one of Tom&#39;s best. As a boy Forrest
Gump is known as stupid and is always picked on. But through thick and
thin he at least he always thought he had his best friend Jenny.But
with some turns for the worst Forrest is without Jenny and gone to
Vietnam. By using his big heart he is proclaimed a hero. And how he
comes through on his promises and show everyone what real friends
should be like.<br /><br />THis movie will have you very sad and it will make you think of what
life is really about. Because this movie is about the life of a simple
man who because of his kindness succeeds! This movie is of
love,action,drama and of Forrest Gump a hero.
