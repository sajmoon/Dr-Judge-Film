Forrest Gump is possibly one the greatest movies of all-time. Like many
people, I have seen it many times. Like many others, the famous quotes
from the movie are installed in my brain. Like many others, I deem this
as one of my favorites movies ever. Why is it so good? Many good
reasons. One for sure is the natural entity of Forrest. He may seem a
dumb guy who can&#x27;t think &#x27;logically&#x27; but he has a good heart. He has a
good intentions and people recognize that. People love to see someone
who has an ability to look by all the bad events which happen in the
life. Forrest brings that kind of peace and aplomb which people need in
their life. People need to have hope. And Forrest shows that if there&#x27;s
an attitude, there is always hope for good things. Good things happen
to good people.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is one the best actors. His peak was in 90&#x27;s and this is his
masterpiece. He&#x27;ll be always remembered as Forrest Gump. He is perfect
for the role and a worthy Oscar winner. His character is so likable
that people care about him immediately. The supporting cast is also
memorable. Great performances by Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, Robin
Wright and Sally Field.<br /><br />The life of Forrest Gump is fascinating. He did things that made people
love him. Not to express sympathy for him, but truly look up to him. It
is a story of a lifetime. A story that moves anybody who believe in
good things. A compelling, touchy and emotional movie. Forrest says
that life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna
get. Pick a candy. It&#x27;s probably delicious.
