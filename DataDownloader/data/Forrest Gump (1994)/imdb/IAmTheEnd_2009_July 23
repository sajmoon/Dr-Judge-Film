Hi I Know a lot of people will bash me no matter what i say but I guess
thats just the internet.I finally got to see this movie for the first
time recently and thought i&#x27;d give my 2 cents.well to say that the
movie is epic that would be an understatement.spanning some 25 to 30
years how forrest was &#x22;supposedly&#x22;part of these major historical
events.now to the meat of the review.I have been waitig to see this in
Hd for a while (the reason I held out)and finally was given the
oprotunnity.(just thought I&#x27;d throw that in)The movie is at times
masterfully directed,acted,and wrote giving its spot in the top
250,other times it is not for 1 the ending feels forced as though eric
roth could not think of the proper ending and was very frustated and
just gave it the&#x22;B&#x22; ending.Robert zemmeckis forever gets a pass for
Roger Rabbit.but gotta say he way overused the whole &#x22;forest narrates
something someone said,then said character says word in said
situation&#x22;at first you really feel as though your watching a master at
work later it feels gimmmicky.Tom Hanks is the only not at total fault
he does what he needs to do.Don&#x27;t know about an Oscar but at least a
nod.Now to what I was gonna to say.Im from a very small town smack dab
in the center of Alabama Pop 2500 nearest city 15000.This movie is
NOTHING Like Alabama its actually almost offensive.we do not talk like
that,it does not look like that,it is not that.Thanks p.s actually my
favorite of the movie is the editing very seamless and subtle no wonder
it got the Oscar
