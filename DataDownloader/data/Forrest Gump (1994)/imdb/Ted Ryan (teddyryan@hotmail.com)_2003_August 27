Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickson once said, &quot;If you're gonna die, die
with your boots on.&quot;  I feel much same way about Bobby Z's FORREST GUMP.  A
pure star vehicle for Tommy Gun Hanks.  He basically plays Jesus Christ
without the ability to be a pacifist all of the time; which, I will admit,
at times is touching.  Especially when he watches Jenny (Robin Wright Sean
Penn) play guitar at a strip joint, mistaking the event for a legitimate
concert, and then slugging the skum balls that harass her. <br /><br />I also praise this picture for not being preachy.  It deals with large
chunks of American history and treats them objectively, letting us decide
what really was going on during such turbulent times.  Gary Sinise is also a
charm.  <br /><br />Unfortunately, huge parts of FORREST GUMP lack the firepower to keep us
glued to the story.  As a result, we become bored and wonder when Bobby Z is
ever going to have the guts to make a period peace that does not use the
most cliched songs of all time. <br /><br />Ted's Grade: B-/B
