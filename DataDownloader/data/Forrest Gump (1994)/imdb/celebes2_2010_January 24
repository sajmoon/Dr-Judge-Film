I can&#x27;t believe the vitriol hurled at this movie. I have seen this
movie a number of time since it was released, and it never fails to
move me and make me laugh.<br /><br />And by the way I am a liberal, Ivy-league educated guy who went to
college in the 60&#x27;s, protested the war (and still thinks it was one of
the biggest mistakes in American history) and has never voted
Republican in his life. And I never thought of this film as a secret
right-wing propaganda movie until I read the reviews here. In fact, it
pretty accurately depicts some of the characters during that time. For
example, the abusive, self-important boyfriend of Jenny&#x27;s during the
march on Washington was all too common (and someone who Jenny, as an
abused child, would have been drawn to, unfortunately). Some guys who
were against (or just avoiding the war) apparently needed to prove
their manhood. Hence the SDS-a lot of those guys were real dicks- I
know, I was there.<br /><br />These characters are individuals- not symbols. As for Forrest, he goes
to Nam, yes, but he is color blind, unlike everyone else depicted in
the movie (black and white) and stands up for a battered woman. Those
seem like pretty liberal virtues to me.<br /><br />His great qualities are his loyalty and non-judgmental and loving
nature, which are independent of his IQ. There were plenty of very
stupid people of Forrest&#x27;s generation who behaved very differently
toward blacks and women. Jenny&#x27;s father is a perfect example.<br /><br />So maybe its an American cultural or generational thing, because I
notice a lot of the film&#x27;s bashers are from Europe. Lighten up. Its a
fantasy, a comedy and yes, has a large dose of nostalgia for the music
of the sixties and seventies.
