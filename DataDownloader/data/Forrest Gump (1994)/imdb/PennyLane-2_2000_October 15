I have to disagree with anyone who thinks that Forrest Gump is a great
movie. I thought it was just completely stupid. Maybe the idea that this
character of low intelligence accomplished all that he did was suppose to be
a moving, feelgood story, but I thought it was just plain stupid. This is
definitely one of the most overrated movies of all time. It might have been
enjoyable if he had only accomplished things that hadn't really happened. It
was just ridiculous that he was suppose to have come up with the idea for
the smiley face and the &quot;--it Happens&quot; thing. And I despised the scene with
John Lennon. That was just in extremely poor taste. And I don't think that
the FX were as great as a lot of people say. The scene with Kennedy looked
good. But the rest of them were not that good at all. The only good thing
that I can say about the movie is that Tom Hanks was very good in it. I'm no
huge fan of his, but I have to admit that he did a good job in this stupid
film.
