Forrest Gump is quite simply one of the best films ever made. If The
Academy
would've given the  Oscar to Pulp Fiction, like others have suggested, it
would've been their worst moment hands down. I love this film and to the
people who don't like it they either don't get it, or they're jumping on
some kinda bandwagon. Anyway 4 out of 4 stars.
