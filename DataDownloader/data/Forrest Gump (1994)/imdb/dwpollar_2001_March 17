1st watched 8/11/2000 - (Dir-Robert Zemeckis):
Almost flawless story of a man who may have been considered retarded by the
world around him, but had a sincerity of heart that betters most. Some of
the over-the-top accomplishments he dictates to his bus-stop friends seem
added in(especially his running across the country.) Hanks performance
shines consistently.
