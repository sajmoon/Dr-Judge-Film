&#39;Forrest Gump&#39; is one of those movies that will blow you away from your
living room, and into the world of the title character. Tom Hanks does
a superb job in acting as the simple-minded man Forrest Gump whose
positive look on life and whose kind friendliness will grasp your
emotion. Jenny, Lieutenant Dan, and even Bubba are all characters that
are well-done enough to blow you away. This movie is truly a classic,
and I would personally recommend it to anyone. &#39;Forrest Gump&#39; is not in
the least bit like any other movie I have seen, and though some parts
are very sad, happiness amounts in the end. &#39;Forrest Gump&#39; is a true
cinematic masterpiece. <br /><br />Rating: PG-13 for drug content, some sensuality, and war violence
