Forrest Gump achieves a Rockwellian canvas without being head in the
clouds about America. Beyond the great pleasure of following Forrest
through his storied life, a protagonist neither long on intellect nor
burdened by it, the depth of the all around character development has
me completely absorbed from beginning to end. It is really something
special for a protagonist to have four relationships so well
cultivated. I also consider it the best cinematic treatment of the
Vietnam War. The nobility and absurdity of it is evinced.<br /><br />Well deserving of its many accolades in one of cinema&#x27;s best years, the
film blends humor and pathos perfectly. It creates a world for itself
whereby the few poetic licenses do not detract from the experience. I
find no fault in it. It doesn&#x27;t even have a notable production mistake.
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants are nice, too! <br /><br />Simply put: Forrest is pure innocence, free of pretense and
calculation. A great character unlike any other I have known. I was
recently delighted to screen the film for someone who had not seen it,
so it is to such people, however few they are, that I address this
review.
