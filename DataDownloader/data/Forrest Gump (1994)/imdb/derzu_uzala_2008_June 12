2008_June 12 
Because my English is not quite up to the task, I&#39;m going to borrow the
words of another reviewer from the UK: &quot;a nauseating piece of
reactionary twaddle&quot;. Frankly I couldn&#39;t put it better - this is right
wing propaganda at its worst; all the more so because it&#39;s wrapped in
(mostly) competent directing and acting (although Gary Sinise&#39;s
&quot;performance&quot; is frankly irritating). Sorry let me rephrase and
apologize to right-wing people, who are entitled to their political
views: this movie is (bordering on) fascist propaganda.<br /><br />There is so much to love about America, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; brings out the
worst in it. An insult to anyone&#39;s intelligence - I hope it gets
remembered as the &quot;Leni Riefenstahl&#39;s movie&quot; of the Reagan area.
