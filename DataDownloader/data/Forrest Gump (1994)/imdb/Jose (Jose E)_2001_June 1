Well, leaving aside the sad memories this movie brings me - which don't have
anything to do with my overall point of view, I would like to express how
annoying Forrest Gump results to me. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I
don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack,
which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious
exception.<br /><br />Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but
this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been
premiered in the rest of the world.
I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it,
though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because
the word had been out that they had to.<br /><br />I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest
Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the
US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.<br /><br />Five out of ten, and that's being too fair.
