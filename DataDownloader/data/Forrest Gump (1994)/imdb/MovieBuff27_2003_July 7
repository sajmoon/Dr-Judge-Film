2003_July 7 

This is  probably the best movie i have ever seen. I have seen a lot of
movies, and have really studied films and would say to myself that the
best
movie would have to be the one that reaches out to me the
most.
Forrest Gump really touched me deeply. As it is truly a magical movie.
It
enhances minds to think that it can take the events of a simple individual
to make a difference in life.
In the movie, Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) experiences nearly thirty years
of
history. He had accomplished many things that many people cannot do. He is
a
hero, and nobody would forget him.
Academy award winner Tom Hanks, has out-done himself as a simple trying
to find the meaning of love, and helping out mankind. Nobody could have
done
it better than Tom.
Forrest Gump won Best Picture of 1994 at the Academy Awards. It was the
greatest movie ever made.
