&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. I
remember seeing it in the theaters and now I am glad to own it on the DVD.
Tom Hanks (Oscar-winner) is Forrest Gump, a low intelligent, but an innocent
man, who was a runner, a college football player, a soldier in Vietnam, a
ping pong player, and a shrimp boat captain. It was from the mid-1950s to
the early-1980s. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is one of the best and most important movies
of the 1990s. Good thing, Robert Zemeckis won the Best Director
Oscar.<br /><br />10/10 stars.
