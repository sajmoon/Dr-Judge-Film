Personally, I think that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The
drama aside, it still features some great comedy moments. The acting is
great, and the plot is very interesting, and shows us how a man which
considered to be an idiot by many becomes involved in many historical events
without even noticing. A must-see for everyone.
