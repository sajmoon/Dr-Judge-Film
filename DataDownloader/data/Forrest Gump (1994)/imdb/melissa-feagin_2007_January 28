I&#39;m not sure at why I read some of the &quot;hated it&quot; reviews, but what I
read was shocking and disturbing. If people can&#39;t go to the movies and
relax their tight political, antagonizing viewpoints for a few hours to
relax and take it a pure bit of goodness, then they obviously don&#39;t
need to see a movie that advertised just that. Forrest Gump is what
many &quot;special&quot; people are in the world... I have a close family member
who is mentally challenged, and he sees the world in a much different
way than the rest of us. He doesn&#39;t think of money first, nor of
popular opinion, and sometimes he doesn&#39;t even think of the
consequences. He acts upon his upbringing, his knowledge of right and
wrong, good and evil, and what will bring a smile to the faces of
others, and that is the mentality that carried the character of Forrest
Gump through some of the toughest times in our nation&#39;s history.<br /><br />My parents went through the same time period as Forrest.. I guess if he
were real they&#39;d be around the same age. They stuck to their guns (and
morals) during the 60&#39;s and didn&#39;t partake of any of the drugs,
partying, etc... (and yes, they voted for Reagan), and they are the two
most conservative, Boring people I know. So I&#39;m not naive enough to
believe that everyone who sailed through those times on the coat-tails
of Jesus himself emerges wealthy...being naive and stupid does not
result in wealth. However, speaking of Jesus, he does say, &quot;The meek
shall inherit the earth&quot; and to have &quot;faith like a child&quot;. And those
are the two themes that I personally believe are being conveyed
throughout the movie. Lt Dan&#39;s injuries and consequential behavior had
nothing to do with his political views..it had to do with him being
unappreciative that his life was saved!! Instead of being thankful for
having more days on earth, he was cynical and jaded and almost drowned
in his own self-pity...forgive me if I don&#39;t see a connection to his
political affiliation there. So I&#39;m confused by the critics who try to
over-politicize this &quot;feel good&quot; movie and make it more than it is..
this is a simple statement on mankind and the pleasure of living the
good in life. Tom Hanks has a stellar performance, and I can watch this
film over and over and over, as it is truly my favorite.
