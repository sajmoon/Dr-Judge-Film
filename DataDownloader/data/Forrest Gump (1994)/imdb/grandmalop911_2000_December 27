I can not believe 1100 people gave this movie a vote of 1(awful). The plot
might have been a little shaky and it might have dragged on a little bit
but
it was so good and so loaded with drama and adventure it didn't bother me
at
all that it dragged on a little. The people I know who didn't like it
didn't
like it mainly because they thought it went a little overboard with all
his
achievements but I think it was to bring out some important things in
history and what a way to do it. By sticking a made up character through
it
all. It got my attention. I love the soundtrack to. I day before I saw
this
I had said Tom Hanks was a bad actor boy did those words come back to
haunt
me. I had never seen such good acting in my life at the time. Not only do
I
think everyone should see this movie I think they should own it and the
soundtrack. Matter a fact I'm gonna go watch it right now.
