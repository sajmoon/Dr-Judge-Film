I know a lot of people may disagree but i find this to be the best
movie ever made. The script, the direction and most of all Tom Hanks
stunning performance made this movie perfect for me.<br /><br />This movie is about a slightly mentally challenged man (Hanks) who
finds himself parts of very memorable parts of history. He tries to do
his best and thats exactly what happens. As the story goes on he finds
himself doing amazing things throughout the world.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie. Its touching, its breathtaking, its filled
with action sequences, its exciting, i could go on forever because this
ovie literally has everything you could want and more. There is a
reason this movie won 6 Oscars in won award because it is hands down
the best movie ever made. This movie is for everyone no matter who you
are this movie is for you. 10/10
