1998_November 5 
<br /><br />For those of us who do not subscribe to the conservative, Mom's Apple Pie,
American Dream twaddle that this film propagates (i.e. Most of the World)
then this film is patronising and annoying at best, insidious and offensive
at worst. Lets look at the main messages in this film shall
we:<br /><br />1) Even if you are a simpleton, don't worry. Tow the line, do as you're
told, don't question  war, injustice, corruption, exploitation etc and
America will reward you. Remember, if you do want to say anything of worth,
make sure the microphone isn't working.
2) Question authority and you will die of AIDS (but lets not mention
Homo***uality)<br /><br />All in all a propaganda movie mourning the passing of the 1950's Anglo-White
Middle Class America whose myth died with Eisenhower. &quot;Life is Like a Box of
Chocolates&quot;? No I don't think it is really is it?. And as for one reviewer
comparing it to Schindler's List - you should be ashamed of yourself. I
wonder how Forrest would have danced around the Holocaust? Probably thinks
it's a caramel cup.<br /><br />
