Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time. It tells of a
mentally disabled man who has lived through so much history and who did
not let his disability hold him back from living an ordinary life. In
fact, Forrest lived an extraordinary life that most people do not get
to experience. His innocence has made this story humorous and
heartwarming. It is very difficult to not fall in love with the
character Tom Hanks has created. Hanks has done a remarkable job with
portraying Forrest Gump making you laugh while your crying. I have
watched Forrest Gump a million times and I can watch it a million more
times. I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie.
