Sometimes....you have to see the world with a child like mind. Take away the
worries and stresses of today's fast paced world and just.....look. See what
you're missing.<br /><br />While I watched this movie.....I WAS Forrest. I BECAME Forrest. I thoroughly
enjoyed it.<br /><br />I read the comments below by Mr. Ben Morgan  and I tend to disagree with
many things. <br /><br />I also saw &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was just plane------bland.<br /><br />&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was just plane------stupid.<br /><br />Neither one of those movies compared to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, even though they
were all three nominated for awards in 1994.<br /><br />Mr. Morgan claims in his comments that in years to come, the Shawshank
Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than
the over-awarded Forrest Gump.<br /><br />Well....here it is six years later. Forrest Gump is talked about more than
either of those two movies. Don't get me wrong, okay ? The other two are
talked about, but Forrest Gump will hold the hearts of people more than
those two ever will.<br /><br />
