1999_April 6 

This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Forrest
Gump
just happens to be at every event which was important for
US
history the last 30 years. Maybe he was responsible for
the
assassination of President Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther
King.
When they showed the first landing on the moon I expected him to show up
and
shake hands with Neill Armstrong.<br /><br />Moral of the film: act stupid and you will become the richest
bore in the world, act normal and you will be punished in every possible
way.<br /><br />Furthermore don't you think that Mr Gump is an alien from outer space?
Nobody knows his father, his behaviour is robotic and super-human at the
same time and Forrest jr will conquer the world. A kind of one man
&quot;Invasion
of the Body-Snatchers&quot;.<br /><br />
