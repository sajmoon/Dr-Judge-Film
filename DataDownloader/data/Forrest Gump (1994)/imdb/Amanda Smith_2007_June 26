This was such a great movie, Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar, he was
amazing! This movie has one of the best actors and actresses you can
imagine! Robin Wright Penn, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, they&#39;re just so
great, and the plot of the movie is so great, because their are people
like that, and it&#39;s so true that that could happen, and it did happen.
Like their were people like that in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s, and 80&#39;s, like when
Robin&#39;s character gets A.I.D.S., that happens all the time, and when
Mykelti&#39;s character dies in war, happens everyday, and when Sally&#39;s
character dies from cancer, happens everyday. This movie is so true and
just so great! I love it! Overall this movie is the best! 10000 stars
:D
