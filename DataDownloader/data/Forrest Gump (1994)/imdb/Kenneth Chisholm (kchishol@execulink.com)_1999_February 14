1999_February 14 

While this film has good points which others have already mentioned, I
wanted to point out some points that really irritated me.<br /><br />The #1 thing is that this film would shed tears for the shooting of George
Wallace, an opportunistic politician who curried racist favour for his own
cheap political gain, yet have NOT ONE mention of Martin Luther King in any
way, shape or form.  This was even though he was working in Alabama at the
same time when Forrest was growing up and it would be certainly more
believable for Forrest to meet King than 90% percent of the celebrities he
meets in his life.  I'm not asking him to meet Malcolm X, considering he was
working in New York at the time.  Yet, King is ignored as if he didn't
exist.<br /><br />Second, the cross country marathon screams of being tacked on.  I fail to
see any humour in it and my eyes rolled how the media completely ignores in
their reports that this &quot;mystery marathonner&quot; is an All American football
player, a Congressional Medal of Honour recipient, a ping pong company
spokesman and a millionaire owner of a fishing fleet.  You would figure this
would make a lot of hay for any reporter writing this up about a man who can
do all this and have a IQ of less than 75.
