1999_June 5 

I think this is the best movie ever made. I know many of you would
disagree,
but I really enjoyed this movie. There is more to this movie then what you
see on the screen. The film shows how Forrest went through many important
events, but the only thing he really wanted, Jenny, he couldn't have. This
movie also shows that even though Forrest was slow, he had a lot of love
in
his heart. He wasn't intelligent, but he knew what love was.<br /><br />What Tom Hanks did in this movie is incredible. He made up a character
that
so unbelievable but is so realistic. He did an extraordinary acting job,
and
that is why I think he's the best actor.<br /><br />I think the best part of the movie is when Forrest stands next to Jenny's
grave, and recites that speech. That part was wonderful. Especially when
he
says &quot;And our son, Forrest...He's just so smart Jenny. We go fishing
together, we run together...&quot;
It was great!
