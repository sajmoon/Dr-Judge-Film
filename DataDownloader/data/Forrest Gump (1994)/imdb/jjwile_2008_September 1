I remember when this film first came out back in the early 90&#39;s.
Forrest Gump who is not to bright became apart of one of the most
historic events in the world without him really realizing it. it
dramatic....its funny.... and such an inspirational film. I remember at
the end of this movie when it was still in theaters everybody started
clapping cheering getting out of there seats and clapping and cheering.
This film is a cult classic. One of tom hanks biggest acting roles that
made his career. Sally fields had an amazing acting role as being
forest gumps mom. This Film will go down to one of the most greatest
films that ever came out
