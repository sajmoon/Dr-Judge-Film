That does include the Vietnam War, the fight for civil rights, and the
Watergate Scandal. During his life he also meets the Elvis Presley,
John Lennon, President Kennedy, President Reagan and President Nixon.
The funny thing is that not at any time did Gump understand the
importance of the events he was witnessing. Jenny, Forrest&#39;s good child
hood friend, is there from times to times during the whole movie.
Forrest and Jenny are for a long period of time divided from each
others, because they are living so different lives. Even so, they both
eventually fall in love with each other. Gump is a quite simple man,
and does not seem to be worried about the fact that everyone obviously
is smarter than him, which I do believe he understands. I think the
main point in this movie is that happiness doesn&#39;t take intelligence or
money. It takes love, good values and achievements that are important
to you.<br /><br />Me myself enjoyed this movie very much. It is touching, entertaining
and educational at the same time. When I think about it later, the
whole story does not seem very likely. What is so amazing, is that I
did not think that thought one single time while I was watching the
movie. The acting, the dialogue, and the film-technical aspects are so
realistic and brilliant, that I completely felt like this was really
happening. I also love Hanks character, which is just as brilliant as
the rest of the movie. The next time you need motivation for living a
spotless, innocent and morally correct life, go watch this movie.
