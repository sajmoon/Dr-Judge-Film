FORREST GUMP is a vaguely picaresque story of a mentally retarded but
good-hearted fellow who grows up during the 1960s and 1970s, serving in
the
Vietnam conflict, running a shrimping trawler, and pursuing a very
unlovable
childhood sweetheart.  He has no control over his life, but is not smart
enough to realize it or care.  Gary Sinise co-stars as Lt. Dan Taylor,
Gump's ex-C.O. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung
around his neck.<br /><br />It's been five years since I saw this movie, but I still remember how it
annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most jaded parts of the
viewers' personalities.  The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells
the
audience that his sweetheart Jenny's father loves her a lot, always
hugging
and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled
through
the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement
that Jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms
this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on the
entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very
concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug
and
kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.<br /><br />Jenny's character is so despicable that Gump's love for her is
inexplicable.
Perhaps it is intended as an example of really &quot;unconditional&quot; love, and
shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who
clings
to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits
rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue and taken
his
child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize
to him because she was &quot;messed up.&quot;  Gump swallows this excuse with
stomach-turning ease.<br /><br />Now I don't want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade on the
decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in
the
past in many ways.  Racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to
being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less
frequently
than in bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned.
Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing.  But in some
other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, &quot;I
was
messed up,&quot; is perhaps the best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from
Jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including
cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase &quot;I was messed up,&quot;
followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes.  FORREST
GUMP
wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral
thought.  I'm not buying into it.  Being &quot;messed up&quot; may excuse
viciousness
against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to
justify
hurting innocent people.<br /><br />The movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is
also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed
at
some of this exploitation).  I may not want a mental deficient like Gump
for
an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic
decency
and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard
Nixon's hand, says &quot;I gotta pee.&quot;  This is funny?).<br /><br />The mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting.
Tom Hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a
mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly
convinced
me and the average moviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and
pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my
nerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is
absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every
pore.<br /><br />I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few
movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually
drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and JURASSIC PARK
also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors
lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern
special
effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly
than
most directors have.<br /><br />I didn't really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much
that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy.  But it's morally
obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the
philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look
after
fools.<br /><br />Rating: ** out of ****.
