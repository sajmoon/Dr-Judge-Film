 This is one film I must call a brilliant triumph.  It is the simple story
of a simple man, who through dumb luck, becomes a multi-millionaire.  He
never forgets the love of his life and he ends up marrying her in the end. <br /><br /> I am not an emotional person, but I get tears in my eyes every time I watch
the ending of this movie (when Forrest is standing at his wife's grave.)  I
am not a fan of sequals, but I would love one made of this film.  Forrest
Gump II, I feel, would be equally enjoyable.  Overall, I would rank this one
in my top five films of all time.  A remarkable film.
