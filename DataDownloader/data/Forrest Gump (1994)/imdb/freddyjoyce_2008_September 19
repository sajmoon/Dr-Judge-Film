Jenny and Forrest.......what can I say ... excellent movie. Great
entertainment. Tom Hanks like you have never seen him before. Sally
Field as his Mother ... as you have never imagined her before. It is
about determination and doing the RIGHT thing because it is RIGHT. It
is a very good movie..well produced and Tom was fantastic in it. If you
are the one in a Million who has NOT seen this movie ... It will be a
CLASSIC in twenty years...it already is. GREAT MOVIE, full of comedy
with some Drama through his life experiences. Just an all time favorite
movie of mine. Life is Like a Box of Chocolates, You never know what
your gonna get ! I couldn&#39;t have summed life up any better than Forrest
! Good thing about this movie IS...you KNOW you will get some wonderful
entertainment .. it is definite ! OH and Bubba&#39;s Shrinp ...did YOU know
