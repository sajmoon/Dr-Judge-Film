1999_June 23 

This movie uses all the sappy, sentimental tricks in the book to sucker the
audience into believing in poor, disadvantaged Forrest Gump: the sick
mother, the bad legs, the innocence of incomplete mental capacity, the
bullies, the girlfriend, etc.<br /><br />If that's as far as it went, however, I wouldn't be writing this. The
dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and
stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American
history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to
pull
so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of
the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.<br /><br />Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think.
The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers,
for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using
tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in
settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive
and manipulative.
