A lot of people put Forrest Gump down saying among other things, that it is
mediocre, didn't deserve the oscars, and is totally overrated. Well well
well, I thinks these people are just jealous that such a nice-natured, clean
and harmless movie won over Pulp Fiction, the epitomy of a cool film
wanna-be. <br /><br />Overrated? C'mon it got much less hype than almost every movie released
these days. At least Forrest Gump had content and depth as opposed to Pulp
Fiction which didn't even have a point. <br /><br />Forrest Gump is an excellent movie. You can tell that a lot of work has gone
into it, and everything about it is great, the acting, the script, the
directing and cinematography, it's all excellent and above all, it's a great
story!<br /><br />Rent/buy this video if you want to see a proper movie, instead of such
B-grade tripe as Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />
