This movie made me cry. It is so beautifully made. The story is unique
and interesting, and you will never get bored. I can definitely
recommend this movie to everybody! It is no action movie, nor a
thriller, it is a great drama for everybody. Nobody can hate this! My
favorite movie. We go through many big events in this movie, as if
we&#x27;re there ourself. How they pictured the famous persons I have no
idea. It is amazingly done.<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie 10/10, because there&#x27;s nothing bad to say
about it. It touched me more than any other movie i&#x27;ve ever watched.
Even thought I prefer horror and thrillers, action and movies with a
fast and less deep story, they cannot compete here.
