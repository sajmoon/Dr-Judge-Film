This movie contains everything one could desire, and more: 1. A
congenial main character main character one simply has to love 2. An
entertaining lesson in American history 3. A beautifully casted, still
not too sentimental love story 4. A multi-layered storyline, keeping
the movie interesting even after viewing it a few times 5. A
heart-warming story, where I cannot help to shed tears 6. One of the
best movie soundtracks ever 7. An optimistic and positive outlook even
in the most difficult circumstances. 8. Some simply yet smart quotes to
be remembered. 9. Beautiful photos and shots, with smart use of
computer editing. 10. All this makes it one of my all time favorites,
and at least a 10!
