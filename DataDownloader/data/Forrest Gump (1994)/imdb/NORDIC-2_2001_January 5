Politically, &#x27;Forrest Gump&#x27; is the ultimate wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing, a
deeply reactionary film that valorizes stupidity as akin to some sort
of transcendental innocence. As embodied in the figure of the
good-hearted simpleton, Forrest Gump (played by the ever-smarmy Tom
Hanks), this movie encourages its audience to embrace quietism and
noninvolvement as the best means to cope with modernity&#x27;s horrors.
Everyone involved with this monster should be ashamed of themselves.
Ditto for the geniuses who showered this piece of dreck with honors.
Worst irony of all: this awful film beat out the superb &#x27;Shawshank
Redemption&#x27; for Best Picture! Yikes!
