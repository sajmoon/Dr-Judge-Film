although many people thought that forrest gump was boring and were
frustrated by forrest's simpleness, this movie is actually a great
source of symbolism of how simpleness can lead to happiness. As viewed
in certain religions, such as daoism, simpleness is the way to truth
and understanding of how the world works. <br /><br />Forrest gump never tried to change things, and never had egotistic and
meddlesome efforts to turn something into something else. This made his
live simple and care-free, and ideal life style. Whenever he gained
something, he did not take advantage of it or try to manipulate its
powers. Instead, he accepted it, and if it happened to leave his hands,
did not ponder over its departure. this attitude of life led him to be
truly happy, something that is hard to do, even though it may not seem
so. he never stopped loving, even though his friend from childhood took
twists and turns and they grew their separate ways. It was a very
touching movie. he took things as they came, never stopped loving,was
truly happy, and that,therefore makes him one of the wisest human
beings.
