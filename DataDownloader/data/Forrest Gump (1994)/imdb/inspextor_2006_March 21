Forest Gump is an outstanding movie. It touches so much about American
History. It gives you an idea of how America was back in the 70's. When
the hippie revolution was going on. The Vietnam War, schools
segregations and so many other events that left a mark in American
History. <br /><br />Tom Hanks performs at is best in this movie. Forest who is categorized
as a &quot;special&quot; child lives through events that many &quot;normal&quot; children
would never experience. Getting to meet the President of the United
States, becoming the mvp of the coollege football team, becomes a ping
pon world champion, and by luck ends up oweing a multi-million dollar
fishing corporation.
