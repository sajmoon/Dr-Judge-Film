As my 10 reveals this is one of my favorite movie ever. It's a movie
about what matters most in life...family, friends, love, honesty. I
liked the imagination of the author, the story is simply fantastic and
the acting...well he got an Oscar for it so I got nothing further to
say about it. I think Forest is the luckiest man ever and not because
of the money, because of his naivety. Why? Because thanks to that he
saw only those important things. He didn't care about winning a game or
winning the war, or making money, or buying a fancy car, or having sex,
or any material thing whatsoever.He kept the life simple and I think we
should do the same....except the part with sex :)
