This beautiful film was a window into life and love in many ways:
mother and son, friend to friend, romantic love, love of country,
paternal love, and finally love of self. Forrest, the main character,
is seemingly such a simple-minded man. He was thought to be stupid by
many around him, but through the choices Forrest makes, we see the
depth of his commitment to those around him and the unconditional love
that he offers to all. Forrest was not a brilliant man, but he was a
good man, a generous man, a man who made his world a better place just
by being himself. I have watched this film several times, and each time
I have found it to be an amazingly sensitive look at life.
