Check this movie out! It is a film that sends a great message to its
audience. It really is about a person who just lives their life as they know
best and deals with the outside world with ease. It is never easy to go out
and try to please others and make them feel better about themselves than it
is just to be who you are and know that the greatest asset one has is
themselves. Take the time to get out and get this movie watch it and look
for its message. One should be advised that it has a book that you can check
out at your local library and remember that it is a movie it may not contain
every little detail there is in the book but it still has a great message.
Best of luck to you who wants to see this film.
