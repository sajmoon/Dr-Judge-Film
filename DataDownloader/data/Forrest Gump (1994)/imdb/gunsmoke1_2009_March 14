My husband and I have seen this movie at least 20 times and each time
we see or hear something we missed before. It is the most heart warming
movie with many lessons of life. A child starting out with a handicap
that in those days he was remarkable in his handling of it. He was not
low functioning though he could have been if not for family and then on
to all of his experiences that he entered so innocently. The showing of
all of the times from discrimination to the &quot;flower children and
Vietnam&quot; was amazing and quite a history lesson. The warmth and humor
in the movie was so tastefully done and the acting of all the major
characters were superb. We need more movies like it and how it displays
that people can be different and still contribute to this world in a
big way. My husband will keep right on watching this movie if not on TV
we will watch our own DVD. Thank you Forrest Gump. Life is like a box
of chocolates you never know what you&#39;re gonna get.
