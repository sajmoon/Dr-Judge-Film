For the life of me I will never understand the popularity of this movie.
It
is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic
mess.<br /><br />The entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until
eventually I just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching
another minute.  That gimmick consists of inserting Forrest into an
historic
event and watching him emerge triumphant.  That the film repeatedly has
Forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times
in
recent American history---Vietnam, segregation, the Cold War, etc.---is an
insult to the people who lived through those times.  To say that Forrest,
with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually
experienced
the event into which Forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an
affront to America itself.<br /><br />One of the greatest tragedies in its Oscar sweep is that &quot;Gump&quot; won for
Best
Editing over &quot;Hoop Dreams,&quot; a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage.
&quot;Hoop&quot; is riveting for every minute while &quot;Gump&quot; drags on and on with
superfluous scene after superfluous scene.  Could that &quot;Forrest running
back
and forth across the US&quot; have possibly been milked any longer?  This lasts
15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of
time.<br /><br />And as for Forrest's &quot;soul mate,&quot; Jenny, this little slut is a despicable
character who abuses Forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and
emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect.  This character does
not
deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt.<br /><br />&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is woefully, abominably bad.  Its main gimmick is cute the
first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade
comes
crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (Hanks is an
Oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both &quot;Cast
Away&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;) and inept editing.<br /><br />In my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all Best Picture
Oscar
winners.<br /><br />Rating: 2/10
