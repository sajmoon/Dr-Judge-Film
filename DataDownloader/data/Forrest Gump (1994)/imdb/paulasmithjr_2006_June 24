I felt this was one of the better movies coming out of Hollywood in a
long time. To me it represented everyone&#39;s point of view for the period
it portrayed. Its comical overtones were great. The drama shown was
hard hitting and to the point without a lot of senseless gore. Tom
Hanks did a tremendous job. Gary Sinese was excellent. Supporting cast
did a great job bringing out all the little nuances of &quot;Dear Ole
Forrest Gump&quot;. The movie was a great piece of entertainment. One could
object to portions of the script but all in all it came across as good
entertainment. For those that don&#39;t think so, relax, try to look at it
again in a spirit of lightheartedness.<br /><br />Should have at least a 9.99 rating.
