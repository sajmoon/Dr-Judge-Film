Wow, I found a number of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in this movie, too much to go
into detail here without writing what looks like a novel, so I'll
condense my thoughts with notes here. I don't expect many to agree with
me but overall I found this good very good storytelling and a film that
stays with you.<br /><br />The GOOD: 1 - a totally unique story back when it was released and
still that way, unlike anything else I've seen; 2 - an involving story.
You really care about the lead character &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; who is
magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination
of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll
never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an
excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout,
with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti
Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the
unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all &quot;peace and love;&quot; 8 -
a sweet, tear-jerking ending.<br /><br />The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock
is just fine is not a good message. (&quot;You didn't do anything wrong,
Forrest,&quot; says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child
out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political
shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against
Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in
vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.<br /><br />Overall, the &quot;good&quot; far outweighs the &quot;bad,&quot; making this a truly
memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of
&quot;critics.&quot; Maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a
negative light. That's too bad. I owned this DVD and got rid of it. I'm
sorry I did because I'd watch it again and I've seen it three times.
Love it or hate it - you don't forget it.
