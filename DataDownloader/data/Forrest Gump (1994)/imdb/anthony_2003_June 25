After a bout of depression I indulged in a moment of quiet
self-reflection,
and I remembered how Forrest Gump ran across the United States and simply
rationalizes the trend he set: &quot;I just felt like running.&quot; Some things are
best done and for reasons we don't know why and I think a simpleton
personality like Forrest's is something adults overlook and take for
granted.<br /><br />He represents a symbol of how losing self-consciousness is often the road
to
happiness and also that living is of just doing and not questioning &quot;why?&quot;
all the time. Of course, it would be near impossible for the resume of
events to occur in the life of one man, but the message reaches to
everyone
who got into decisions attributed to pure innocence and good heartedness
and
came out triumphant. Reminder that there's a little of Forrest in all of
us-
a balancer of the often-serious life society dictates the selfish messages
of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Good messages to anyone who needs a little
boost to a bad day.
