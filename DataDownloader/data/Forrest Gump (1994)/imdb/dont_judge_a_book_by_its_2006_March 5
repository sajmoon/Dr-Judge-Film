this is a heart wrenching film, that will make you cry and laugh at the
same time.. i know how clich&eacute;d that sounds, but i really loved this
film, i thought it was so original and Tom Hanks is amazing in it! i
recommend you to see this film if: 1) your looking for something moving
2) you got a while cos its quite long 3) you want to watch a film that
makes you think. tom hanks plays an excellent role, and always keeps
the character going throughout the film, you really feel pity or
happiness for him, he really gives it his all. I'm not sure how great
this review really is, I'm really just going on bout how good the film
was without any reasons, but I'm unsure of what to say. i definitely
think, however, that it is a classic film, that will be watched for
generations.
