It makes you feel good. Isn't that enough? You may think I'm wrong or
whatever but all the 'it means this, it means that' stuff is ridiculous.
Stop looking for every political point or secret influence. Its fictional,
we know that, it takes you on a journey and you enjoy it, if you didn't
then, well, I sorry for you!
