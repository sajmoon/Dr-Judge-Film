This movie is great.I enjoyed it very much and is one of the best I&#x27;ve
ever seen(and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of movies).This movie is about the life
of Forrest Gump.This movie is all you need if you want to relax and see
the beauty and ugliness of the life.Forrest Gump is the life itself.The
movie starts with Forrest Gump who is on a bank waiting for his bus and
tell the story of his life to the listeners who come and go.During the
movie Forrest tells them the story but when he finishes telling his
story he finds out that he has a boy.It&#x27;s a movie that must be seen. In
the end her wife dies of cancer and he is alone with his boy that has
the same name as him, Forrest Gump.
