This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The humor is great, Tom
Hanks is great, the backgrounds are great and everything else is great.<br /><br />But the best thing about movie is the lesson it gives us. It is a movie
about humans and humanity, how we complicate things, how we always see
the bad things instead of the good things, how we always care about
what other peoples think of us, how our selfishness only make us
unhappy and how all this things make us unable to move forward.<br /><br />The main character is a contrast to humanity. Forrest is seen by
everyone as stupid, but his uncomplicated mind makes his life
uncomplicated as well. Forrest is like a feather(naive) that blows with
the wind and do not let complication hold him back. He just follows
some doctrines that his mother thought him, originally taken from the
bible probably. This tells us something about religion, we always
complicate the bible and seeks something that is impossible to find, or
we question the doctrines and the stories. If we just followed the ten
commandments without questioning it, everything would be perfect.<br /><br />The movie also tells the American history between 1960 and 1990, but in
a original and deep way. How the Nam-war and the war against
communism(or any other war) was a complication created because humans
seek a perfection we never can get. We see how the hippies try to seek
perfection true drugs, and others also trying to find an answer trough
different ways. But the only one that can live a free life is Forrest.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a masterpiece with many important lessons to learn.
10/10 for maybe the best movie ever made.
