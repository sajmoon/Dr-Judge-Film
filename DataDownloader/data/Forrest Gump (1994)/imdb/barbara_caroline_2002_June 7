Forrest Gums is a charming film that captivates audiences and wraps you up
in a beautiful story about life and the american dream. This movie is the
stuff that dreams are made of and the characters easily warm your heart. I
would say that this film is certainly an epic and I've always felt it was
an
emotional rollercoaster. This film is not easily forgotten and has that
magic that only so many films have. Tom Hanks gives one of the best
performances ever in film history. Great special effects, and an incredible
soundtrack work together to create the classic that is Forrest
Gump.<br /><br />
