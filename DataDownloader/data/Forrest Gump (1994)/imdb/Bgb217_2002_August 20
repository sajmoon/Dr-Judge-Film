 I have said in other reviews here that other movies are my favorite, but
only a select few all share my top number one spot. Forrest Gump is one of
them. I felt I had to write something about it, after just seeing the end
again on TV; I was just flipping and came across the ending of the most
compelling movie ever. <br /><br /> Need I say anyway of Tom Hanks' brilliance in this role, I just love the
character of Forrest Gump. And the story-- oh, the story, it's so
heartbreaking at times, it's so hysterical at times, it's so everything but
bad at one point or another-- it's perfect. The story is told so well, the
characters are so good, the lines are unforgettable. Needles to say the way
they blended the amazing story in with real history is above brilliant...
there isn't a thing wrong with this movie. It's my favorite of all
time.<br /><br /> Concluding, Forrest Gump is cinematic perfection, to all the highest
degress. Everyone and thing in it is brillaint, ten out of ten, no, infinite
stars is what this movie deserves. Forrest Gump is my favorite all time
movie, and that's all I got to say about that.
