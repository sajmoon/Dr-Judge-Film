2002_March 4 

One of the best in a long time.  A mix of fantasy and fiction that seem
awfully real . . . . . with  purity of heart and good deeds and the way
people should act evident in abundance.  It both touched the soul and
brought forth laughter. Tom Hanks is apparently good in any role. Robert
Zemeckis may not direct one to match this.  A keeper that can be watched
again and again.
