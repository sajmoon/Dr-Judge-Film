****<br /><br />Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally
Field.<br /><br />A rather unintelligent man makes history as the decades pass by.  He does
all sorts of stuff.  'Nam, Watergate, JFK, college football, etc.  The movie
is such a huge and beautiful historical movie that will always be remembered
in most people who had watched this hearts.
