First, let me say that 1994 was an excellent year for the Oscars. Such
movies as Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz
Show, and Four Weddings and a funeral were the contenders for best
picture. It was a tough choice for the academy, but Forrest Gump went
home with the Oscar.<br /><br />The movie is a look back upon the life of a naive man named Forrest
Gump. He believed everything his mom taught him, and he was innocently
involved in some of the key events of the 20th century.<br /><br />The movie is funny at times because the audience clearly knows what is
going on around him, but he thinks almost nothing of it. There is some
good historical information in this movie, in fact, a high school
American History teacher could consider showing this movie at the end
of the year, because Forest Gump takes us back to the beginning of
American History, and progresses all the way through it.<br /><br />This is a long movie, but it is of very good quality, and I think it is
well worth your time.
