I have seen &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (FG), a number of times, since I first saw
it theatrically July 1994, when it was first released. I was first
captured by it&#39;s beautiful music score. Then the story and Tom Hanks&#39;s
performance as Forrest Gump, also won me over. This film knows how to
push the right emotional buttons. There is no conventional story or
plot in this film, yet the film works very well. Some people dislike
this film, because the main character is of low intelligence and his
adventures in life seem hard to believe. There are several reasons to
attribute the big success of this film. Partly the screenplay, partly
Tom Hank&#39;s performance, partly the music score and the film&#39;s sweep
through 30 years of recent and familiar American history. FG is a very
American film. Americans like a story of a simple person achieving
great things. I believe many people reacted and related to the
character of Forrest Gump in this film. A simple, innocent and humble
man achieving great things in his life. Part of the moral of the story,
is that brains aren&#39;t always necessary to achieve in life, a warm and
kind heart can achieve in other ways in life. The story idea is that
life is both destiny and luck. I like that philosophy and agree with
it. To me, FG is a modern classic, American film.
