Anyone who finds this movie to be trash, I just don't understand why. Most
movies are not to be taken seriously and this is one of them. Forrest Gump
is just about a simple man living through his life. It's not a historical
documentary it is a movie, and a masterpiece movie.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, yet again is as perfect as ever and rightly enough won the best
actor oscar. (Anyone who doesn't like Hanks I don't understand, what is
there to dislike about him??!!) The supporting cast, especially Gary
Sinise,
Sally Field and Robin Wright are also magnificent and together they all
put
the cherry on the cake for this movie.<br /><br />I agree that it is a (sort of) American movie but that doesn't make it a
bad
or wrong movie. It wasn't overrated in the slightest because it is such a
great movie and I believe that it deserved all of the credit and awards
that
it receievd.<br /><br />If you love movies and Tom Hanks (like moi!) and are willing to watch
anything with an open mind then do yourself a favour and see it. I
gurantee
that this superb best picture oscar winner (and rightly so too), it will
not
disapoint you.<br /><br />Thank you all for being patient to read this, I'm glad I got that off my
chest!
