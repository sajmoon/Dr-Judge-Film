People who dislike &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; simply because it won a Best Picture Oscar
over modern classics like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; are
doing the film a disservice.  Nobody really considers the Oscars to be a
true indicator of artistic merit anyway.  Director Robert Zemeckis has
created an excellent fantasy that manages to combine comedy, drama and
emotion.  It is not a perfect film, true, but it's still better than ninety
percent of the movies out there.
