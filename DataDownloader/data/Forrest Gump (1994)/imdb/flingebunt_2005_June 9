First I thought this was an American remake of Run Lola Run, but it
turns out to be a completely different movie.<br /><br />Forrest is an Anthropomorphic Personification of America, he gets
involved in everything from war to business, ping pong to peace
protests. But he is a little bit slow, so he is an innocent.<br /><br />Is this how America sees itself, an innocent, making itself through the
world? Possibly. Interestingly this movie is incredibly popular in
China, maybe for the same reason.<br /><br />It is an entertaining movie, showing the history of America, not
through the eyes of important people, but ordinary people. Forrest is
the person you see in the TV footage gaping at important events,
getting to go all sort of places without any plan or idea of where he
is going.<br /><br />The music is perhaps a little bit too laboured, with 20 songs for every
time period, and some little scenes having multiple songs.<br /><br />So Run Forrest Run......
