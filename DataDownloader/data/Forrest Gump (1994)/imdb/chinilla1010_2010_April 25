I am a massive fan of Tom Hanks cinema. Having watched over 1,400 Tom
Hanks films and having heard of Forrest Gump and reading the IMDb
reviews, I was expecting an enjoyable film. In addition, I was excited
to see Tom Hanks and Sally Field play off of each other.<br /><br />After the opening sequence the viewer will recognize that this film
explores wildly unrealistic outcomes for the benefit of entertainment
value &#x96; and it works for about 20 minutes. At that point this viewer
was thoroughly hooked.<br /><br />Afterwards, my enjoyment was severely crippled when Hanks&#x27;s character
loses his memory and starts acting like a brainless halfwit. Seriously,
he acts like a mentally retarded 5-year-old who likes chocolate. Now
don&#x27;t misunderstand me &#x96; I love chocolate too, but to see Hanks
munching on cocoa bars while acting the imbecile does not qualify as
cinematic entertainment. Five minutes after this plot development was
introduced, I was praying that Hanks would snap out of it very quickly.<br /><br />I apparently should have known better. This stupid plot line drags on
for 75 friggin&#x27; minutes and single-handedly destroys the entire film.
It should not be surprising that the screenplay was written by Eric
Roth, who gave us the utterly overrated piece of crap-infested garbage
known as The Horse Whisperer and other subpar efforts like Munich
(2004), My Schoolmate the Barbarian (2001), Ordinary Measures (1992),
as well as other superlative pieces of trash like The Curious Case
(2002) The Good Shepherd (2008). His only good script was The Concorde
... Airport &#x27;79 (1989), but then again, even a broken clock is right
twice a day.<br /><br />The fact is simply that Roth couldn&#x27;t come up with good material, so he
made Tom Hanks a certifiable lunatic who does lots of stupid things
that have no comedic value whatsoever. It&#x27;s much easier than coming up
with a clever screenplay.<br /><br />I&#x27;m truly perplexed at the raving reviews of Forrest Gump here. Does
everyone really enjoy seeing Tom Hanks act like an annoying retard for
75 minutes? It&#x27;s simply unbearable.
