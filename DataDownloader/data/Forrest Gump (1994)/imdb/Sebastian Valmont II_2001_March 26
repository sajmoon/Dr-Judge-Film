Quite simply, this is one of the most despicable, offensive films ever made.
It's central message is that if you shut up, do what you're told and never
question anything, you will be rewarded. If you speak up for something you
believe in, and it goes against authority, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED! (Like Robin
Wright's character, who dies of AIDS). 
That this won Best Picture over the innovative Pulp Fiction is appalling
(but then again, let's not forget that Titanic beat out LA Confidential, and
The Truman Show wasn't even nominated) It deserves none of the accolades it
recieved, and as for Tom Hanks' performance, well let's just say that any
sitcom-level actor can play retarded with ease. A bad, bad, bad, bad film,
and in the nastiest way possible.
