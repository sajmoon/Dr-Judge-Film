This movie was simply excellent. The acting was great(especially
TomHanks) the story was awesome, and the directing was superb. The way
Tom Hanks acted was truly worth his Oscar. Next to his role in The
green mile this is the best film he has made. This is just one of those
movies where you can sit down and enjoy! It has got everything: humor,
drama, adventure just great. Some here are saying that it is a blown up
mediocre movie, well if that is what you think you&#39;re just a dumbass
cause this is one of the best movies ever made. There is no accounting
on taste, but this movie is an exception :P I just can&#39;t stop saying
how much i enjoyed this movie! From now on this is one of my all-time
favorites!<br /><br />Perry
