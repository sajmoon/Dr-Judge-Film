Forrest Gump is a film that has a lot to live up to. Many people
consider this one of their favorite films. Plenty of critics put it
down as one the better films ever made. As someone picking it up for
the first time over ten years after it was made, I was apprehensive of
what to expect.<br /><br />Yet, just like the character, the film Forrest Gump is never
pretentious even from the very first minute. We meet Forrest sitting on
a bench waiting for a bus to come. Someone sits down next to him, and
Forrest begins to tell his life story. Simple, poignant, and
ridiculously funny is this tale of a man who accidentally finds his way
into every major event of his generation. Forrest changes the world in
unimaginable ways, but all he really wants is Jenny, his childhood
friend and the girl he&#39;s loved his entire life.<br /><br />Yet this simplicity is where the movie&#39;s strength comes in. Everything
is really very simple for a man whose IQ is no greater than 75. This
simplicity deceives us into taking a whimsical tale for granted, and
then surprises us with its incredibly moving final scenes. We don&#39;t
quite realize how wrapped up in Forrest&#39;s world we are until we find
ourselves in tears by the end. And when we leave Forrest&#39;s world, we
miss him very much. We miss his easiness and simple way of living. 8/10
stars! <br /><br />Jay Addison
