I think this film is an absolute masterpiece. The performances from all
involved, the music, the screenplay, the effects; in short it was a
classic
from the moment it was edited.
Tom Hanks is superb as Forrest Gump and delivers an amazing performance as
the innocently naive boy from Green Bow, Alabama. I really can't dwell on
anything in particular, so if you happen to read this review, the only
thing
I would suggest would be to review it personally. Watch it yourself, and
I'm
certain it'll have an effect on you. A powerful film, one of my all time
favourites.
