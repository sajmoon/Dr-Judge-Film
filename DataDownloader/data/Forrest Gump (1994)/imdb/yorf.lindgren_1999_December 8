1999_December 8 

Until this movie came around, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was my
favourite.  For me, this movie showing up anywhere but in the top 10 is a
total travesty.  It offers everything that you could possibly ask for in a
movie.  Maybe realism and believability are in short supply, but if that's
what you're looking for then watch the news.  With this movie, one moment
you're laughing the next crying.  As with life, this movie is like a box
of
chocolates, you never know what you're going to get next. In my books, a
10
all the way!
