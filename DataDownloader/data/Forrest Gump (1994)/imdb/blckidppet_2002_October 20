You know a movie is outstanding when it wins Best Picture over Shawshank
Redemption (also one of the best movies of all time), and this film most
definately deserved it. The acting is superb. The writing was unreal. The
casting, amazing. The humor is ingenious. The directing, amazing. A
timeless
movie.
