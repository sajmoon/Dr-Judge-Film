1999_August 22 

This film is a major piece of drivel. Its popularity is an alarming sign of
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of art, thought, taste and education. It is no wonder
that it made many millions and is so well loved. At least it was Tom Hanks
who made the millions and not Charlton Heston. Harrumph!!!!!
