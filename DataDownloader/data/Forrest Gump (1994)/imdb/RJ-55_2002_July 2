When I had to go, you know, I went!<br /><br />The decade of turmoil and self searching delivered with unequaled clarity
through the eyes of a simple man with little education.  What happens to
him
takes us through some of the unforgettable events that ended up shaping
our
very lives.  What an incredibly well choreographed dance through one of
the
most tumultuous periods in American history.
