There is so much to love about this dynamic movie and I think it very richly
deserved every Academy Award that it won.  It takes us on such an excellent
trip through three decades of history and tells an extremely entertaining
and inspiring story of how a simple minded man went on to accomplish so
much.  This is one movie that I never get tired of watching and is most
definitely an all time favorite on my list.
