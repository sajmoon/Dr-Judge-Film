I loved the movie even though he was pretty much told the whole story
by himself. He made himself seem as if the whole world is gonna be OK
just the way it is. He goes threw a lot of different things but he gets
through it. he is a sweet and caring guy who has no problem telling you
what he feels. he would never lie or do anything to hurt anyone.<br /><br />this is an excellent movie if your trying to make a point u should
definitely watch.very good inspiring movie.<br /><br />His life is a lot like others but he gets through the difficulties and
loves everything even if it wasn&#x27;t supposed to go down the way it so
happened to. Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job on playing the role of
forest gump.
