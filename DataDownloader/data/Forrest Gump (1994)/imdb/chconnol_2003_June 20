I hated this movie when it came out and I still loathe it.  All the
people
in the audience I saw it with were &quot;oooo-ing&quot; and &quot;ahhhh-ing&quot; at this
cornball, manipulative, simplistic garbage.  I notice now, nearly ten
years
later no one talks about this movie at all.  Krap is as krap
does...Hollywood garbage posing as &quot;art&quot;.  Ugh...save me from stuff like
this...  What's strange is the Zemekis' next movie, &quot;Contact&quot; was
Excellent.
It's one of my favorite movies.  Go figure...
