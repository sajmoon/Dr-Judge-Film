This movie is simply a metaphor of the 60s. Forrest, the simpleton, is
representative of the simple man; everyman, and Jenny is a '60s
seeker'. Forrest goes through life as most of us do: living, loving,
meeting his obligations, whereas, Jenny, is constantly seeking, and
finally finds that what is meaningful has always been within her reach.<br /><br />Winston Groom wrote the acclaimed Vietnam War novel Better Times Than
These, the prize-winning As Summers Die, and co-authored Conversations
with the Enemy, which was nominated for a 1984 Pulitzer Prize. He is
also the author of the No.1 New York Times bestsellers Forrest Gump and
Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump. Mr Groom's Shrouds of
Glory, an account of Confederate General John Bell Hood's decisive
actions in the last great campaign of the US Civil War, was published
in April, 1995. He lives in New York City and Point Clear, Alabama.<br /><br />I find it terrific that this 'best political' movie escaped, Hollywood
unnoticed.
