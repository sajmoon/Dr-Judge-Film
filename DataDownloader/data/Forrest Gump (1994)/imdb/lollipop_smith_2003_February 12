If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you really shouldn't even be on this
website, this is one of the greatest films ever so you must go and watch
now
in order to make a judgement on any other film ever made, this one sets
the
standard for the films of my generation and is an asset to Hollywood. But
for me, what makes this film stand out more than any other with a
genuinely
moving intelligent screenplay is not the unforgettable moments with quotes
such as  'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one
you're
going to get' which eloquently explains the questions of the universe nor
is
it the endearing character study supported by some of the finest actors in
the industry (Sally Field, Robin Right Penn, Gary Sinise and Mykelti
Williamson are all exceptional) but it is one man- Tom Hanks. Although
'everybody casts Tom Hanks'and the question why? is always asked, well
this
answers all questions.  In his best performance of his career he earned
his
Oscar with every-compelling moment he is on the screen. Every aspiring
actor
should be frantically taking notes of this outstanding display of acting.
perfect.
