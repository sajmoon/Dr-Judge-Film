1999_August 24 

In the early 90s Michael Medved wrote a book urging Hollywood to eschew sex
and violence and make films that extolled the virtues of America, family,
religion, apple pie, Thanksgiving, home-baked cookies blah blah blah. He was
arguing from a 'moral' (read 'conventional Western family-oriented'
standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the bottom line. He
reckoned that more 'nice' films would encourage more people back into the
cinemas.<br /><br />Forrest Gump would appear to be the realisation of Medved's dream, to the
extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the list, namely
abject stupidity. <br /><br />Because that's what MM and his cronies really want, isn't it? Movies that
don't challenge, don't irritate, don't ask awkward questions. Movies with no
toilets (see Pleasantville), movies that operate on the assumption that a
fortune-cookie-spouting dullard who loves his mom is some kind of embodiment
of the American dream.<br /><br />Wake up, America. You managed to elect one Hollywood simpleton with a
tenuous acquaintance to reality. Now you make movies about them. In the
words of the greatest American philosopher, D'OH!<br /><br />This is a dumb movie, made by clever, cynical people, for other people who
want to feel all warm and fuzzy and not worry about the fact that they lost
all form of intellectual discrimination the day they took out that
subscription to Reader's Digest. It sucks like an industrial vacuum cleaner
on amphetamine sulphate. Yuk.<br /><br />
