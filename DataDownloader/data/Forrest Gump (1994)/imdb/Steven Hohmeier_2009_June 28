this movie is phenomenal it has changed my life it shows how you can
achieve great things in your life i gave this movie a 10 because thats
what it deserves it is that good and i highly recommend it, tom hanks
did a phenomenal job in his role and so did the entire cast. and when
this movie won best film some people were shocked that the shawshank
redemption or pulp fiction didn&#x27;t win but this movie did deserve that
academy award definitely. This movie shows how many things can happen
in a life time such as going to college, military, opening a big
business and even death. this movie has really inspired me and if you
have not seen it i highly recommend it. My favorite quote from the
movie (life is like a box of chocolates you never know what your gonna
get)
