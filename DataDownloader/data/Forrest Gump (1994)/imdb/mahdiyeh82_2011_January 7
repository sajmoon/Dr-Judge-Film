Forrest Gump<br /><br />Forrest: My momma always said,&#x22;life is like a box of chocolates. You
never know what you&#x27;re gonna get.&#x22;<br /><br />It is a 1994 American comedy-drama film based on a novel of the same
name by Winston Groom. The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, staring
Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. The story is of the Forrest
Gump, a man from Alabama, his travels all over the world and the
experiences he has had in his life. The film was first released in the
United States on July 6, 1994, and was well received by critics. It
earned over $677 million worldwide. The film garnered multiple awards
and nominations, including Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards,
People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and Young Artist Awards. The film starts by
showing a feather floating in the sky and coming to Forrest&#x27;s shoes.
Then we see Forrest, sitting at a bus stop, taking the feather and
telling his life story to the woman sitting next to him. As he tells
his story, the listeners at bus stop change. Some of them are
indifferent; some do not believe him while some others are interested
and even fascinated. He was born with strong legs as we see later but
with a crooked spine. The first day of school he met Jenny, the girl
who changed his life. Once while they were walking among the trees,
some boys tried to bully him. Jenny shouted&#x22; run Forrest, run&#x22; he
started running and tore the strings which tied his special shoes. From
that time on we see that his special ability and talent is running.
While in college, again he was bullied by some boys, and this time ran
through football field where he was recognized by the coach and invited
to the team. After that he was taken to arm where he met his best
friend Bouba who died later on in Vietnam. He saved some lives and also
got wounded during the war and when he came back he received a Medal of
Honor. While in hospital, his hobby was playing ping pong. He became a
member of Army&#x27;s team and went to China and won the competition with
the Chinese and became a national hero. During his life he met
different presidents and other famous people like John Lennon. All his
life he was in love with Jenny and finally he married she and they had
a son whom she had called Forrest. He started his shrimp business and
became successful in it. Then through Lit. Dan, who he had met during
war, invested some money in other businesses but went back to his
hometown and lived with his momma till she died. For some years he was
running without any reason. After Jenny&#x27;s death he continued his life
bringing up his son. It seems as if the feather which is carried by the
breeze and is left in its hands and goes wherever is taken, is Forrest
himself who is moved all his life by others. In the film in a scene
when he was talking to Jenny&#x27;s grave he was wondering &#x22;if we are all
just floating around accidental-like on a breeze&#x22;. The first days of
his life it was his mother who told him what to do or not to do. Later
it was Jenny who took up the role and it was by her demand that he even
overcame his physical problem. This shows itself so vividly in
Forrest&#x27;s first encounter with Drill Sergeant when he answers the
Sergeant that he was there&#x22; to do whatever you tell me, Drill
Sergeant!&#x22;. Even his success in ping pong was due to the fact that the
first day he was told not to take his eyes off the ball.<br /><br />The times he starts doing something without others ordering him, the
action is misled by others. It can be shown best in his period of life
when he started running. At first nobody paid attention to him but
after a while he was surrounded by lots of reporters who tried to label
him by some movement. Although he was completely ignorant, the answers
he gave to those questions inspired some people. In the process, he
forms the iconic&#x22;simply face&#x22; logo and tells the man to &#x22;Have a nice
day&#x22;. This way others try to control his actions.<br /><br />Although he had no plan, by his actions, which sometimes even seemed
stupid, he changed the way of American history. While staying with
President Nixon in Watergate hotel, it was by his phone call that the
security office was informed of what was going on there and it
initiated the Watergate scandal. In his interview with Dick Cavett,
where John Lennon was a guest too, his answers inspired Lennon to write
his famous song &#x22;imagine&#x22;. Finally we can say he was an individual who
had no will. When he was in love, he was treated in a way he even did
not know his feeling and later on when he was told the child was his,
he accepted it without hesitation. He was an individual who was
affected by collective will. Whenever they wanted they sent him to war
and when they were tired of war they took him to anti-war meeting to
talk against war. During Cold War he was sent to China to beat the
enemy in sport field. He is the individual human being without any will
who is taken wherever he is destined to.
