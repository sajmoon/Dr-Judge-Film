I hated this movie when I first saw it. I felt it was about my life. I
had to go out in the lobby during the Vietnam combat scene. Even though
I did not go to Nam, I was affected by it. Forrest goes from Elvis and
The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the
ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later
developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I took my son to
D.C. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the
Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the
quintessential baby boomer life unfold was painful. Seeing Sally
Field's transition from a 70s babe to a maternal type was also
disconcerting.
