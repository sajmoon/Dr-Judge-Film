many people love this movie,some even calling it a work of
art.however,i must respectfully disagree.i found the movie
uninspiring,at best,at mostly one long bore.if you like your movies
heavy on sap,you will like this movie.this movie at times felt like one
long &quot;i&#39;m okay, your okay,we&#39;re all okay&quot;inspirational speech.if i want
motivational advice,i&#39;ll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru. all
kidding aside other than the film&#39;s heavy handedness,there are a few
good thing about it.the acting was good,the special effects were
decent.the best thing about the movie,however is its 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s
soundtrack.despite it good points,the movie is not worth recommending.
3/10
