When I first saw that movie I knew that I must see it again and when I
saw it again I knew that I must see it again and when I saw it again I
knew that I must see it again and since the last time I saw it I'm
waiting to the time I see it again! Of course the story is practically
impossible! Or may be not!! But the message in the movie is too strong
to neglect or to ignore, the amazing actor &quot;Tom Hanks&quot;, who proved by
this movie that he is not just an actor but he's one of the best actors
in the history and that's for sure and he proved that too in &quot;Cast
Away&quot;, and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and all his other movies.<br /><br />A simple message through the movie saying &quot;Whoever you are, whatever
you are and wherever you are; you can do anything&quot;!! I'll always
remember the words saying &quot;Run Forrest, run...&quot;!!
