1999_July 23 

I wasn't born and raised in the U.S., and I loved this movie as an
involving, touching, yet sober view on three decades of American history.
I'm led to think that pure-breed Americans (especially if in their fifties
now) must have loved it even more.
Anyway, the historical events of a country mingled with the personal life of
this naive but strong character make for a great narrative
device.
Excellent movie for everybody.
