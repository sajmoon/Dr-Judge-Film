I think this is one the best films i've seen. I was realy sorry for Forrest
in very scenes because of the way that jenny was to him . I agree with the
comment that says that she was using him all the long and it made me think
that we all are used by someone at least one time in life. I have only one
problem with this film and it regards to the oscars because this film beat
2
of my favorite films of all time (pulp fiction and Shawshank Redemption
).
