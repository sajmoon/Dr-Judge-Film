1999_June 28 

I can't think of any reason why someone would not like this movie. It
seems
to have just about everything you want: comedy, romance, action,
tragedy...
The script is simply ingenious, and Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump
is stunning. The humor is based on Forrest's dumbness and wonderful &quot;this
is
how [item] was created&quot;- histories that show great imagination by the
writers. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
