All i can say is that this is by far one of the best movies ever. The
story flows perfectly, the characters are flawless, the events are all
meaningful, the dialogue is clever, it is funny, it is sad, it is
smart...it is all things great. Tom hanks is a great actor and he fits
the role perfectly. This is my personal favorite movie and always will
be. What is so great about this movie is the fact that the flashbacks
flow flawlessly. With some movies that attempt a flashback type story,
i feel lost in the order of events. The characters in this movie are
also some of my favorites and there is a significant change in all and
you learn to love all of them, even Lt.Dan. If you don't ever see this
movie you are missing out on a classic.
