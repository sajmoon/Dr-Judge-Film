Genre: Drama/Comedy<br /><br />Star Rating: ***** out of 5<br /><br />Tom Hanks does an outstanding job in this wonderful movie classic!<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays a very unique character named Forrest Gump who has a
low I.Q. and his meeting with the love of his life Jenny (Robin Wright
Penn). The film chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the
most important people and events in America from the late 1950's
through the 1970's including a meeting with Elvis Presley, John
F.Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The
problem is, he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions.
Forrest becomes representative of the baby boomer generation having
walked through life blindly and has the time went on he learned a whole
lot more. The one thing I thought was pretty cool about Forrest Gump is
the way he plays ping-pong (or sometimes called table tennis)! I was
amazed during one part of the film where Forrest Gump ran all the way
to Arizona!<br /><br />This movie won 6 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a
Leading Role, Best Director, Best Effects/Visual Effects, Best Film
Editing and Best Writing Screenplay.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: LIKE MY MOMMA ALWAYS SAYS LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF
CHOCOLATES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO GET.
