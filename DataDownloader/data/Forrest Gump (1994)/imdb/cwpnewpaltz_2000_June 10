This is a &quot;cute&quot; movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say
nothing of technologically advanced. Let's face it, this guy Gump knew
everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove
it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty
girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got
this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to
marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm
and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a &quot;dull normal&quot; in IQ terms? He
triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your
brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow,
plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this
technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The
meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!
