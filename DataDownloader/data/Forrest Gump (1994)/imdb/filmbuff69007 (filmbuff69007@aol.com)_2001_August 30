I read the book before going to see the movie.the book was strange but it
was ok.this however is a overrated movie with a highly predictable
performance by Tom Hanks.this movie was both pointless and how it managed to
defeat pulp fiction at the oscars well only the academy know that one.i
hated this movie with a vengeance i saw this the same day as the fantastic
The Lion King.After the highs of Disney came the Lows of Hanks.a truly
pathetic movie.
