Only saved from all-time worst status by a good soundtrack and Tom Hanks'
best effort to turn a truly awful character into someone vaguely
palatable.<br /><br />This movie is an insult to the audience, its own subject matter and to
anyone operating on something higher than basic brain stem
function.<br /><br />Oh, look at the funny retard - he's a moron but he has a simple wisdom
that
can redeem us all.  Fortune cookies are sophisticated when compared to
the
message of this film.  Ugh.<br /><br />It is a sad commentary on the Academy's milquetoast voting standards that
Gump is not the worst film to ever win a Best Picture award.
