I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. I was at my
cousins house, and was not supposed to be watching it, due the the
violence. Although I did not fully understand what was going on, this
film made me cry. That says a lot. I don't cry in movies. Ever. I saw
this movie again when I was older (about 4 months ago) at the age of
14. To this day, me and my friend still quote it. It is amazing on so
many different levels.<br /><br />The love that Forrest has for Jenny, the way Forrest just kind of
ignored all those who said he wouldn't amount to anything because of
his low I.Q., how he remains so innocent through-out the movie. All
these things make this film different from the others. It puts it above
all them. This confirm's my belief that Tom Hanks is an amazing actor.
To portray someone who has a mental incapacity is a very difficult
thing to do, and if I did not know any better, I would think that Hanks
is not acting. The way this film is put together is moving, incredible,
and unbelievable, all at the same time.<br /><br />This movie could never be made over or covered, it would destroy it.
Because of the sheer beauty of this film, I give it 9/10
