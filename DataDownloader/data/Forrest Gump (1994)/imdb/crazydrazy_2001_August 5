I am an easy going movie watcher and I am easily entertained by movies on
all levels like Die Hard, Scream, Beetlejuice, Titanic, NBK, Splash, Mary
Poppins, etc. But I never understood what was so great about this movie. I
didn't see any charm in it at all. The Pulp Fiction guys should have won
the
bulk of the oscars not this.<br /><br />I also agree with one of the comments above that it is easy to act retarded
and that Tom Hanks wasn't great. Really Boring, I even watched it again
just
to make sure it was boring. Thumbs Down!!!!
