1999_May 6 

Phew!  I gave this one two stars, just because some of the effects were
quite good.  Other than that, I have to say, there is very little to like.
Perhaps you have to be a baby-boomer to a really appreciate it.  I'm a
buster myself, and I've never been able to understand the wodges of gooey
praise that boomers like to pile on to this fetid piece of
corn.<br /><br />Tom Hanks (whom I actually like) has to hold a record for the easiest
Oscar
in history.  How hard could it be to just belt out your lines in a flat
monotone, without ever having to show any sign of comprehension or complex
emotion?  Forrest Gump in love looks an awful lot like Forrest Gump
confused, or Forrest Gump angry, as far as I can tell.  The members of the
Academy are suckers for mentally disabled protagonists, but Hanks's Gump
has
neither the depth of Dustin Hoffman's Raymond (&quot;Rain Man&quot;) Babbit nor the
extraordinary movements and expressions of Daniel Day-Lewis's Christy
Brown.<br /><br />If, like me, you like to see ALL the Oscar winners, I suppose you'll have
to
endure Forrest Gump at some point in your life.  Otherwise, stay
away!
