I have to whole-heartedly agree with people who complained about the hype.
I guess this movie was made to pander to the baby-boomers.  Why people
insist that Tom Hanks is a great actor is beyond me.  Don't get me wrong,
I
thought he was brilliant on &quot;Bosom Buddies,&quot; I just wish he would return
to
the small screen.  I remember Bill Maher on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;
remarking on Mr. Hanks winning the Best Actor award for this movie.  He
basically asked how hard was it to portray an idiot?  I suppose Tom
Servo's
diatribe on MST3k accurately summarizes my opinion of this flick.
Something
like, &quot;Oh, so life is like a box of chocolates?  Oh yeah?  Well, I say
life
is like a c*** sandwich; the more bread you have, the less c*** you have
to
take!&quot;  If only there was more bread in this movie!
