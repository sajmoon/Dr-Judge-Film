1999_April 8 

This truly is one of the best movies I have ever seen. At first I was a bit
reluctant to see it because it is a long movie and because I usually like
action movies much more, but I never regretted seeing this
film.
It is touching and warm, yet never over cooked. It's dramatic and
sentimental yet never to an unbelievable degree.
It's funny without losing its credibility or ridiculing America's
history.<br /><br />Forrest Gump simply is a movie which not only entertains you but which also
make you feel good.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
