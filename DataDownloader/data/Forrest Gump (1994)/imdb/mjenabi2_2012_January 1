2012_January 1 
I am 23 years old (2012) and I cannot believe it took me so long to
watch this movie. After watching this, i felt something that i have
never felt before in my life!<br /><br />enough about me, lets get to the movie. I though this movie was one of
Hanks&#x27; best, if not the best, performances. everything he did or said
was 100% believable, a lot of the story was very... how can i put it,
improbable in the real world but he played it so convincingly that i
did not, even for a moment, felt it was actually a movie. it was like
someone telling their life story. only with that funny accent.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone, anyone with any taste to watch this
movie. if you are feeling down, in need of aspiration or have 140
minutes to kill. believe me it&#x27;ll be the best 2 and a bit hours of your
life.
