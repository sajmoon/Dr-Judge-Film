I had not seen &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in many months, but upon seeing it once again,
I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV.
The movie is perfectly done: everybody who you're supposed to like (Forrest,
his mother, Lieutenant Dan, Bubba), you like; everybody who you're supposed
to dislike (Jenny, Dan at the beginning of the movie), you dislike. In such
a dramatic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so funny- or, in a
comedic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so dramatic. The shots of
war are brilliant, and it's easy to believe that the action is real. Tom
Hanks played Forrest as well as he acted in any movie, and Sally Field did
not get enough respect for her performance. I'm sure there are tons of
people who can say something about &quot;Forrest&quot; better than I can, but I've
liked this movie since my early teens, and I still love it whenever I have
the pleasure of viewing it.
