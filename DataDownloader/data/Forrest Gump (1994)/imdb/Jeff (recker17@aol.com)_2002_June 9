Forrest Gump is probably the most under-rated movie of all time.  Two types
of people watched this movie:  Those who lived through the entirety of the
movie, and those who have only experienced a little of those time periods.<br /><br /> The first type of viewer watched a re-lived those shocking moments in
history, as well feeling the general mood shifts of a generation.  The
second type learned more by watching those scenes throughout the movie, than
they will ever learn reading textbooks about those same events.<br /><br />Whether you re-lived the experience, or travelled back in time to feel them
for the first time, chances are that this movie touched you in a way not
many other movies have.
