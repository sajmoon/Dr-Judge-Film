I think that the best movies are those that you &#39;appreciate&#39; or
understand after seeing it more than once. However, with &#39;forrest
gump&#39;, i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it
would be in my top 10 straight away.<br /><br />It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has
a low IQ of only 75. Although he is &#39;mentally challenged&#39;, he finds
himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages
to &#39;forrest gump&#39; his way out of it and end up a hero or role model.
but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the
complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war
movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love
movies can&#39;t deliver...the importance of love.<br /><br />I love that Forrest doesn&#39;t lose his innocence and purity throughout
the movie, or maybe he just can&#39;t but either way, this shows you don&#39;t
need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful.
Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it
doesn&#39;t work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the
acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level.
And in my definition that&#39;s what a good movie should be able to do.<br /><br />Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks.
Now that&#39;s an actor for ya. I love this movie and don&#39;t hesitate to
give it a 10.
