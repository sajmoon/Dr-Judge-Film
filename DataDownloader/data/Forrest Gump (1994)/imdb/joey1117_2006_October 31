Forrest Gump is the compelling story of a person whose IQ is below 80
and still has a very successful life. Forrest was a kid with problems
growing up, and all the kids made fun of him, until they found out how
fast he could run. After that he gained some respect playing football,
for his high school football team.<br /><br />That&#39;s just where the adventure begins, his long and compelling story,
is one filled with drama, action, and a humorous line or moment every
here or there. There are hundreds of memorable lines that come form the
movie, like &quot;Stupid is as Stupid does&quot; or &quot;Life is like a box of
chocolates you never know what you&#39;re going to get.&quot; The movie starts
Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field, whom are really great actor,
who really have great chemistry together. Though one thing, Gary Sinise
had earlier worked with tom Hanks on the set of the movie, Apollo 13.
Sally Field is a long time actress, and delivers a great performance as
forests mother, in the movie.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of life&#39;s lessons wrapped up in one movie, it shows
that anyone, know matter how smart or stupid, can be a great person. In
the movie Forrest Gump, Forrest is that person. He gets to meet 3
presidents, play for his college football team, Join the army, Fight in
Vietnam, get a medal of Honor, make a lot of money, selling shrimp, and
really lived a successful life. He Got married to a childhood friend,
and even had a son. His life can be admired by anyone, as he actually
lived the history back then. This is what makes him successful. Most
people could have lived through those times, like most of our parents,
but most of our parents just lived through the times. Forest
experienced it first hand.<br /><br />Forrest (Tom Hanks) as a character had many things going for him. For
one thing he was a lovable character, whom you cans really connect
with. You can see all of his emotions, and all sides of his character
throughout the movie. You see him happy when he First meets Jenny
(Robin Wright). You seem him get angry when he Sees someone beating
jenny, you see him confused in Vietnam, and you see him confused. This
is part of what makes Forrest Gump, such a powerful movie The movie has
backgrounds to the book Forrest Gump, by Winston Groom. Though the two
have the same title, the book and the movie are like two different
tales of Forrest Gump. The book has more of his life playing foot ball,
and before the army, and the movie just focuses on his life as a whole.
Also the book doesn&#39;t have much of forests child life as the movie
does.<br /><br />The films director, Robert Zemeckis, does a super job bringing the
screen play to life. His interpretation of the screen play is very
well, and the camera angles he uses, with the real life scenarios,
bring the movie to life. The houses he used, and the sets for all the
locations, make it look like they were filmed there. Especially the New
York Scenes where forest attends to Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise).<br /><br />In total, Forrest Gump is a powerful film and really deserves the 6
academy awards it won. Though it says it&#39;s a comedy, its more a Drama,
with a funny scene here or there. Thus it deserves everything it has
