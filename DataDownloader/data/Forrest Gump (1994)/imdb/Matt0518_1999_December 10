1999_December 10 

A truimph of special effects (Sinise's legs, Gump's appearances in history)
and with some wonderful vignettes this is not a &quot;real movie&quot; with a &quot;real
plot&quot;. <br /><br />The film feels like, &quot;and then I did this&quot; and &quot;then I did that&quot; with no
regard to a plot or pacing. Also, the AIDS subplot seemed tacked on and
forced.<br /><br />All and all some great scenes, but not a great movie. But there are worse
things out there to watch.....I give it a 7.<br /><br />
