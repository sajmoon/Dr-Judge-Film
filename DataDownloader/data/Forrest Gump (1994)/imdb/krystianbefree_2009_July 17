In my opinion this movie is the best. Tom Hanks created an
extraordinary character and deserved an Oscar. The film is so deep. I
don&#x27;t have emotional problems but I always cry on this movie. I don&#x27;t
know why but &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is perfect to me. It hits into my heart and
in some way changes me. It gives unforgettable scenes which are truly
masterpiece. Every moment of this film is worth watching because it&#x27;s
amazing. This picture shows life in fascinating way. It shows journey,
fantastic voyage through time which in the end is death. Event that we
can&#x27;t escape or evade. Everyone has it&#x27;s destiny. My destiny was watch
that movie and never forget it. I will always remember this excellent
piece of art. This is absolutely my number 1. I have only 6 movies
which I rate 10/10. &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is definitely on that list as unique
masterpiece. Great film about life itself.
