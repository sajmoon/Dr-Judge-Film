2010_August 3 
There is absolutely nothing to say. Everything in this film is done to
absolute perfection. Every shot is beyond beautiful, every actor is
beyond fantastic, every second of the score is beyond amazing, every
character is beyond wonderful, everything this film gives me is beyond
compare. This film is my favorite of all time, and nobody will ever
steal its spot. Everyone who was involved with this film has earned
more respect out of me than anyone. This is the film that inspired me
to want to make, and review film. I have watched many films, but none
have ever made an impact on me as Forrest Gump. This movie does
everything right. Everything done in this movie is pretty much the best
anyone has ever done. Tom Hanks delivers what is in my opinion the best
performance in film history as the greatest character in film history.
Every word that Forrest says I hold on to. &#x22;Life is like a box of
chocolates. You never know what your going to get.&#x22; If that is the
truth than this movie is a box of chocolates too. When I saw this film
for the first time I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to get. What I got is
amazing.<br /><br />4 stars out of 4
