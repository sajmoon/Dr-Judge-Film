1998_August 8 

Whilst this movie tries to be a serious piece of &quot;art&quot;, all it ever achieves
 is an incredible &quot;we-love-America-cause-everyone-can-be-someone-here&quot;<br /><br />Tom Hanks gained lot of credit for playing Forrest Gump so brilliantly, but
 I can't really say I was impressed. All he did was behave more stupid than
 usually. Anyone could do that, as far as I'm concerned. But I have to give
 it some credit for all the good &quot;Gump-liners&quot; like &quot;stupid is as stupid
 does&quot;. Want to see a good American movie? Watch ID4 or As good as it gets.
 Don't watch this one.
