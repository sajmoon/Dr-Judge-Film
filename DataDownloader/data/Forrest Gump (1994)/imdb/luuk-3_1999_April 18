1999_April 18 

First of all, I think it's very easy to say a film is over-hyped, it'd
show
you're the man who knows what movies are all about and that the big stupid
crowd is unable to be as genius as you are. This is truly a great movie
because of the different levels (plain story- american history -etc) and
the
thought that has went into the story-line, it's perfectly round.It's
touching as it is original. I'll remember this one as being really
different
from the others, which is - in these days- a good reason to receive
oscars,
don't you think? (if you want a hype, look at titanic)
