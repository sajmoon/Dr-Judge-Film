The first time I saw this movie, I was awstruck by the way history was
somehow influenced by this simple man from Greenbo, Alabama, knowing full
well this was just a fictional story. The director made a perfect review of
all the glories and tragedys in the movie. Also the way the writers make the
true love story take over in the end was just perfect for an end of an
eventfull life for Forrest. This is Tom Hanks' all time BEST
ever!
