I can't understand why anyone would not like this movie. Some say it's too
American. You have to remember that this is a &quot;Movie&quot;. Movies are for
entertainment and for sheer entertainment value, this film gets a 10 from
me. The direction, The absolute convincing acting from Tom Hanks, Gary
sinise, and Sally Fields just makes you forget that they ever were in any
other movie. I would have to say that since I saw it, if anybody mentions
the words film and best in the same sentence, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is the first
movie that comes to my mind. every time!
I just can't wait for the DVD edition to come out.
