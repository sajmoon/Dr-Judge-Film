To kill the only enlightened and liberated character (Robin Wright)
with an 'un-named disease' in the early 1980s when both Reagan and
Thatcher refused to acknowledge the aids epidemic is unforgivable. As
is the idiotic notion that 'in America anyone can be anything they
want' - try telling that to the under-privileged, mentally ill,
destitute and homeless. The American hegemony continues to bury it's
head in the sand and disseminate doctrine like this. Don't get me
wrong, I love a great deal about the U.S. (including its people and the
culture that so many Europeans mistakenly laugh about) but their ruling
classes (Government, heads of industry, religious leaders, Hollywood
producers etc) need to look further than their own guarded picket
fences. The power of movies to persuade should not be underestimated. I
don't mean that old chestnut 'sex and violence', I mean hidden
political ideology - The Terminator is running California
frrcrissakes!! Not healthy! Rant over! Thank you for reading this
far....
