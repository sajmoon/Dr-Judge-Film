In reply to the first comments on this movie.... I always thought that
the movie was trying to imply that life is short, take every
opportunity that is handed to you by the horns and make the most of it,
and don't be afraid to try new things, it just might open a door to a
new adventure....why can't movies just be about making people feel good
for a change, too many people try to read into the &quot;secret meaning&quot; of
films.... that's all I have to say about that. But wait there's
more....why is it that our comments have to be 10 lines long? I mean
what happens if we can communicate what we wish to say in LESS than 10
lines?? What then? There ya go, 10 lines.
