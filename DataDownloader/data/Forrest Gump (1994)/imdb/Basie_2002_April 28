Forrest Gumps is a charming film that captivates audiences and wraps you
up
in a beautiful story about life and the american dream. This movie is the
stuff that dreams are made of and the characters easily warm your heart. I
saw this movie during the summer of 1994 with little idea of what the film
was about but I was blown away by this humorous tale of a man with a good
heart who always winds up doing the right thing. I was transported to the
racially torn south of the 1960's and the brutal battlefields of Vietnam.
I
would say that this film is certainly an epic and I've always felt it was
an
emotional rollercoaster. This film is not easily forgotten and has that
magic that only so many films have. Tom Hanks gives one of the best
performances ever in film history. Briliant storytelling, great special
effects, and an incredible soundtrack work together to create the classic
that is Forrest Gump.
