I read the book and saw the movie back in the 90s when both were out
and popular. The book was wonderful. The movie was pure junk! <br /><br />All the darkly sad and darkly humorous parts of the book were
completely chewed up and regurgitated into pablum for the masses, so
that Forrest Gump the Movie would be the feel-good experience of the
year. Which it was, apparently. The masses are stupid. <br /><br />If I was the author of this book, I&#39;d be pi**ed at this movie.<br /><br />This review requires 10 lines, but if I were to write more, it would be
to give too much of my valuable time to this crappy movie.<br /><br />But I want to warn intelligent viewers out there who might not have
seen this clap-trap yet, to avoid it.<br /><br />So I will try to accomplish 10 lines via the return key.<br /><br />Do I have 10 lines yet?<br /><br />Edited 9/20/96 - adding 1 star to this; I&#39;ve seen the worst movie ever
made (Crash-1996) and it&#39;s a true 1-star; no movie deserves to be in
the same class as Crash, therefore I am adding 1 star to all my
previously rated 1- and 2-star flicks.
