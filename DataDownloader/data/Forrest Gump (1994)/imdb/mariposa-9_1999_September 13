&quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; Is probably the greatest movie of all time. And those who
don't like it, are missing out on one of the great movie experience of all
time. It's difficult to fathom someone not enjoying this wonderful film, for
it demands repeated viewings. My feeling is; some just over intellectualize
and forget about enjoying this simple, wonderful film. Or, maybe others have
heard too much about it, and it's a letdown. I find it hard to believe this
would be a letdown for any reason.<br /><br />I can't add much more to what other reviews have already said. Other than to
say; I'll never forget, in the theater, when Forrest is talking to jenny at
the grave.I took a moment to look around and, so many people were wiping
tears from their eyes. That's a story I hope to tell my kids 20 years from
now.
