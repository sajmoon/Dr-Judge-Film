A fairy tale expression of recent American history. This has Tom Hanks
playing a simpleton as the embodiment post-war America and the fact it
won Oscars tells us more about American pop-culture than any erudite
books might wish to say.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Gump, a rather &quot;slow&quot; boy who grows into a &quot;slow&quot; man
and yet manages to involve himself in major events in American history:
racial integration, Vietnam, Watergate and so on, and yet always
manages to remain unwittingly on the side of Liberalism.<br /><br />In other words, this rather saccharine and somewhat nauseous film is
trying tell us that what is good about America is the simple homespun
values of innocence and goodness whilst presumably anyone with an IQ of
above average is not to fully trusted. A naive message in the least
which to anyone with an IQ over 100 or anyone living in Europe seems
the cause of so many problems rather than the solution.<br /><br />If you are looking for a black and white view of the world, an
idealistic and simple and sop for conscience view of the world, then
this might help.<br /><br />For those with an IQ over 100 I would suggest you go elsewhere.
