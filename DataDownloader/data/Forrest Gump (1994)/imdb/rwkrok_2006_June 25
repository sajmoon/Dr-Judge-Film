Anyone who has a problem with this movie on any level probably just
doesn&#39;t understand parables. Gump at it&#39;s basic is a fable about a man
who, although short on &quot;intelligence&quot; nonetheless has a degree of
common sense often absent in his intellectual superiors. Couple this
with his moral compass and the way the story always places him in
interesting situations and you have the canvas upon which this morality
play unfolds. Gump is simple, gentle and loving - but, interestingly,
he is not a wimp. He has courage of his convictions and does not
hesitate to use violence to defend those he loves. Amazing this came
from Hollywood. Refreshing.
