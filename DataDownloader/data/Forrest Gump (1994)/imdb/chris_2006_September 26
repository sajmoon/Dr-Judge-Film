I only bought this film the other day and I only think i&#39;d watched it
once before, but i&#39;d honestly forgotten how great it is! For starters,
Tom Hanks is amazing as Forrest and I don&#39;t think anyone couldn&#39;t done
a better job! All of the main and supporting roles fit perfectly and I
wouldn&#39;t be able to pick out anyone I thought spoilt the overall film!
In my opinion this is a film for everyone because it has enough action,
romance, a humorous and serious side! I don&#39;t know many films that are
told in the way this one is (with the main character reading it like a
story book) but I think it works perfectly because it helps the viewer
feel the character of Forrest Gump! Such a strange character, yet
because of the way it&#39;s told you are able to get a little further
inside his head and see his perspective and what he&#39;s like! It&#39;s a
great story delivered in a superb way and deserves being one of the
true classics! At the price you can get this for now everyone should
have a copy of it! When the film&#39;s finished everyone ends up loving
Forrest Gump!
