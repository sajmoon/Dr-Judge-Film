2001_March 8 

The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious
experiences imaginable.  Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all
time.  &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was robbed for &quot;Best Picture.&quot;  This is one of those
films that people feel required to love because the main character is
&quot;slow.&quot;
