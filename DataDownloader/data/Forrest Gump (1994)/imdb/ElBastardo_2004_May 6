Everybody talks about how great this movie is.  Will someone tell me why?
So a stupid guy wanders through the world, saying all kinds of stupid
stuff,
chasing a drug addicted stripper, and by blind luck wanders into millions
of
dollars?  Yeah, I can see why that's so popular.  It seems like this movie
would make more sense as an inspirational video for retarded people.<br /><br />Look!  You too can be a success without the unbearable burdens of
intelligence or talent.  All it takes is ridiculous levels of
luck.<br /><br />And what about the years of running?  Years of running?  What is that?
It's
just so ridiculous.  Who does that?  Who?  And people follow him?  &quot;I
don't
feel like running anymore.&quot;  You're joking.  Who wrote this because they
should really be crucified.
