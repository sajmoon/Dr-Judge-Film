I didn't mind this movie too much the first time I saw it, though I
thought
it was very over-rated and wondered what the fuss was all
about.<br /><br />I caught it again recently and got more irritated with it the longer it
went.<br /><br />I'll admit that the shots integrating Tom Hanks into historical footage
are
impressive, technically. I'll admit that Hanks, Penn, and Sinise give very
impressive performances. But I'm really starting to hate this
movie.<br /><br />I know, I know...of COURSE it won Best Picture--it's cynically designed
from
top to bottom to do that. It's supposed to teach an important lesson about
life while tugging at the heartstrings as big historical events unfold in
the background. And what is that lesson? It pays to be stupid.<br /><br />Well, gang, sorry to burst your precious little bubble, but it doesn't.
You
won't find guys like Forest running corporations; you'll find them in
trailer parks, beating their kids. Them clever folk, with all that book
learnin' you so despise, are running the big corporations, and they're
laughing their way to the bank over the real morons, who watch crap like
this and think it's great and then vote in Forest-like mental midgets to
run
the country.<br /><br />The worship of the &quot;wise fool&quot;, the disdain for education, and the myth of
the self-made man are a few things Western, and especially American
culture
would be better off without. Anything like this cynical and manipulative
film, which perpetuates them, should be despised, not lauded.
