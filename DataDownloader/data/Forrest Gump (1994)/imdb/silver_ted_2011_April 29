Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film based on the 1986
novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film was directed by
Robert Zemeckis, starring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, and Gary Sinise. The
story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, an Alabama
simpleton who travels across the world, meeting historical figures,
influencing popular culture, and experiencing firsthand some of the
historic events of the late 20th century. The film differs
substantially from Winston Groom&#x27;s novel on which it was based. Filming
took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South
Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the
protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes. An
extensive soundtrack was featured in the film, and its commercial
release made it one of the top selling albums of all time. It sold 4.42
million copies. Released in the United States on July 6, 1994, Forrest
Gump was well received by critics and became a commercial success as
the top grossing film in North America released that year. The film
earned over $677 million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film
garnered multiple awards and nominations, including Academy Awards,
Golden Globe Awards, People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and Young Artist Awards,
among others. Since the film&#x27;s release, varying interpretations have
been made of the film&#x27;s protagonist and its political symbolism. In
1996, a themed restaurant opened based on the film, and has since
expanded to multiple locations worldwide. The scene of Gump running
across the country is often referred to when real life people attempt
the feat. This film is one of the best I have ever seen and i recommend
it.
