You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll just have a darn good time. Tom Hanks gives
the performance of his career, one year after his other brilliant
performance in Jonathan Demme's masterpiece Philadelphia. The supporting
cast is flawless, and the soundtrack would have to be right up there with
the Star Wars soundtrack as the best ever, including my personal favourite
Creedence Clearwater Revival. Anyone who says this film only won Oscars
because, like Rain Man it was about an idiot, has no idea what they are
talking about. Citizen Kane may be the greatest film of all time on a
technical level, and I do love it, but is it as magical as this film?I
think not.
