I have seen this movie at least a dozen times, and it never gets old.
It is just a classic, moving movie that sticks with you for a long
time. I am a big movie buff and have become a careful critic, and this
movie is at the top of my list.<br /><br />The movie is about the life of a simple man. Everyone he meets can't
help but love him because of how sincere and innocent he is. Even
though he is made fun of, loses people he loves, and practically
ignored by the woman he is on love with, he always remains kind and
never holds a grudge.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I fell in love with Tom Hanks as an actor. He
does such a good job of making you love and sympathize with his
character, Forrest. Everyone else in the movie also does a wonderful
job in playing their roles. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies,
and i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes great movies.
