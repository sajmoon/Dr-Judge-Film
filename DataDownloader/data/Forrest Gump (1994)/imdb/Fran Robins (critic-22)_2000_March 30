Forrest Gump<br /><br />DIRECTION &#149;%
Beautiful and skilfully put together with images of hope, despair and wonder
ensembled with a view this could be a family movie.<br /><br />ACTING &#149;%
Tom Hanks gives a truly stunning performance as the boy wonder who has
dreams hopes and so much bewildered inner torment of a person who is seen as
abnormal.<br /><br />EDITING/SPECIAL EFFECTS -%
So much of this that it often blurs the line between the real and unreal
worlds that Forrest Gump inhabits.<br /><br />PLOT &#152;%
Complex and character driven, but can also be seen almost as a children's
movie. This is extremely a hard feat to balance but the movie manages it
well. The themes range from child abuse, disability, the American Dream,
relationship, friendships and the changing face of the 20th century within
an American context - Basically something here for everyone!<br /><br />STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC &#133;%
There is strong action and language. But unlike our usually treatment
expected by the main star, Forrest is like a child in adult
situations.<br /><br />MUSIC &#149;%
Superb use of sixties music that suits the movie from start to
finish.<br /><br />SOUND -%
The use of many sound creates not only the right atmosphere and environment
that the movie is set, but enhances the feel of Forrest's mind and conveys
it well to the watcher, especially in the quieter scenes.<br /><br />HOOKABILITY &#145;%
As soon as the feather flow around the screen!<br /><br />LASTABILITY &#150;%
Most people don't want the movie to end!<br /><br />OVERALL '%
One of the finest movies available that can be almost family viewing which
teaches us a subtle lesson about who and what is normal when we treat each
other so badly.
