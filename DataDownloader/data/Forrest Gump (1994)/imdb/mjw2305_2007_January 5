This movie is the story of a little boy with below average
intelligence, but with a heart that&#39;s worth far more than a few little
I.Q. points.<br /><br />Tom Hanks delivers this outstanding character to the screen and his
performance is truly captivating; just like the story of his life. The
Beautiful Robin Wright brilliantly portrays Forrest&#39;s most cherished
friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny. And this review wouldn&#39;t be
complete without thanking Gary Sinise and Sally Field for their
wonderful contribution to this truly heartwarming experience.<br /><br />Forrest&#39;s story sees him touch the hearts of the entire world with his
simple innocence and strong will to do only what is right; making life
better for many people along his journey.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a movie that you feel as you watch, you will empathise
with the character of Forrest, sharing his experiences whether they are
humorous, heartwarming or tragic. And along this journey you will learn
a great deal about life and its many twists of fate.<br /><br />Good enough to inspire everyone, even the most cold hearted among us.<br /><br />10/10 Unmissable, Unforgettable, Brilliant
