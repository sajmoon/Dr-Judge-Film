Forrest Gump is about a man with the name of the title who is played by
Tom Hanks. Forrest's only problem is the fact that his I.Q. isn't up to
par with most of America. But that doesn't stop him from taking part in
some of the greatest moments of the USA. He just might not know that
he's doing it.<br /><br />We begin the story with a great musical score. It really sets the mood
for what we're about to experience. We then see Forrest sitting on a
bench. He begins to talk to the people that sit down next to him. The
audience hears the story and begins to realize that, even with a low
level of intelligence, this is an extraordinary man who has a lot of
important things to say.<br /><br />He even goes into detail about the love of his life, Jenny (Robin
Wright Penn). Forrest explains to the other bench sitters that he never
got the chance to really understand his relationship with her until
later in his life.<br /><br />With a character like Forrest Gump, who needs the other ones in the
film. But the actors who do play those other roles are so good, that we
even get to sympathize for them as well. That's what makes this film so
good and that's the reason why it has become so popular. We care for
the characters and we can really relate to them. This film is a great
example of what life was like for the baby boomer era, but without the
low I.Q.<br /><br />The film ended up winning six Academy Awards, including Picture,
Director, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and Visual Effects. It
was nominated for seven other Oscars, including Supporting Actor (Gary
Sinise in an incredible role), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Sound
Effects Editing, Make-up, Original Score, and Sound.
