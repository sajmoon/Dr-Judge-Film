So... a guy with an IQ of 75 is the man behind pretty much every
important event in American History from the 60s onwards? And all of
that while being blissfully UNAWARE of that? Please... I would have
almost bought it, had it been a comedy, or a parody.<br /><br />But Forrest Gump is damn serious, or at least it looks like everybody
took seriously that stinking pile of feel-good garbage and its cheap
message.<br /><br />I even fail to see a clear political agenda in that god-awful movie: it
somehow manages to reunite both right and left-wing, with its
glorification of America and of the American Dream achieved by the
walking stereotype of leftist self-righteous and hypocritical
egalitarianism.<br /><br />But regardless of its alleged political orientation, Forrest Gump is a
cheap collage of implausible situations, a far-fetched melodramatic
story about a man who got lucky and didn&#x27;t even understand it.<br /><br />Honestly, instead of heartwarming and touching, I found Forrest Gump
utterly revolting.
