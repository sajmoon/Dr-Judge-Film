The humorous, but yet heartwarming tale of a man named Forrest Gump(Tom
Hanks) who tells the story of his life to random people waiting for the
bus. Forrest Gump, who has an IQ of 75, lived the life that can only be
imagined but yet still finds his greatest joy with his childhood friend
Jenny(Robin Wright Penn).<br /><br />The movie is breathtaking! Tom Hanks gives his greatest performance of
all time(better than Philadelphia) and the supporting cast of Robin
Wright Penn and Gary Sinise is wonderful. The movie captures various
major aspects of life from the 60s to 90s with great visual effects and
hilarious comedy. What seems to have been overlooked in the movie that
really makes it even better, is the great camera shots. The movie has
some of the best camera shots since Lawrence of Arabia. The scene with
Forrest looking at where Jenny was sleeping that night with the milk in
his hand was just visual bliss! Overall, the instant classic is
absolutely great in multiple ways.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
