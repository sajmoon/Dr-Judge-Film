this in my opinion is the best movie ever to be made in Hollywood. the
story of a guy with a below normal IQ and the wonderful things happened
to him over his course of life moves you, inspires you, makes you cry
makes you wanna laugh out loud it feels so real!!! i can watch it over
and over again hundreds of times and still not get bored !! the story
is so simple and the way it is narrated is wonderful i got tears in my
eyes in the scene when jenny tells Forrest about his son and he
wouldn&#x27;t understand it!!! this film is one of those which tells you the
value of simplicity and the successes that can be achieved by it!! life
is like a box of chocolates u never know what ur gonna get . this is
one film which gives you a different warm feeling in your heart each
time you watch it<br /><br />an absolute must watch!!!
