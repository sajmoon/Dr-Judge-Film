Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s loose adaptation of Winston Groom&#x27;s satirical novel
still remains one of the most talked about films of the &#x27;90s. The irony
and satire of the novel is still there, but Hanks&#x27;s performance and
Zemeckis&#x27;s direction is what makes it beautiful. One of the best
sentimental films of all time! Zemeckis weaves Hanks into archive
footage and his combination of satire and sentimentality is what makes
this masterpiece so beautiful and effective. It&#x27;s a beautiful story and
has Zemeckis&#x27;s signature visual creativity for good measure. I could
not hold back the tears at the arguably beautiful ending and I doubt
few can.
