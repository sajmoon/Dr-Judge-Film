this is a great movie. tom hanks was awesome. he wowed me with his
performance playing a person with a low IQ. he was very convincing and
was great during his emotional scenes.<br /><br />robin wright did a good job playing jenny. she was a good looking
character who treated forrest like poop. also robin can sing well as
she displayed in that strip club scene.<br /><br />the movie went away from the norm of typical Hollywood movies. the
creators took a chance and made a masterpiece that will forever live in
film history. <br /><br />it also had a great soundtrack, therefor it must be a good movie.
