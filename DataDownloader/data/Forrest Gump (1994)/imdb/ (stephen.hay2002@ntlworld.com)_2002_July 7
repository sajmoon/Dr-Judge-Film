The first time I watched this movie, it passed straight over my head.  It
takes time, to see what this film is all about.  The film is brilliant,
because it starts of with a young boy, who is being told that he is not as
good as the other children, because he isn't very clever.  His mum tells
him
he is as good as everyone else, and shouldn't feel inferior.  Forrest Gump
uses his other talents and teaches by his mother to try his hardest at
everything, and never looses faith and determination in anything that he
did. This made him accomplish, so much when others would have thought he
wouldn't do nothing with his life.<br /><br />People may see this film as a sentimental piece of trash, that makes us
feel
sorry for a idiot.  If you say this then you are not getting out of the
movie what you should be doing.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is the nucleus of this movie, and played a brilliant part as
Forrest.  I think Forrest, had a childlike innocence about him, which made
him accomplish so much, because he only had the teachings of his mother to
guide him in life, and he never saw the dangers, such has the war in
Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie can't help to move you, especially when his mum and girlfriend
dies, and when he finds out he's a father.  The movie has a brilliant
sound-track, and never has a boring lull, it moves at a brilliant pace,
and
keeps you wanting more.<br /><br />I believe this is one of the great movies that has been made, because even
though I am the biggest cynic of them all, even I cannot overlook the
sheer
brilliance, and imagination behind the movie.  This is a truly great movie
that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />
