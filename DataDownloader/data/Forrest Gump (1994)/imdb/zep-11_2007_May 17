This is the ultimate movie. It contains within it all of humanity and
human history, wrapped around one special guy: Forrest Gump. Gump is
clueless to this fact, he is just looking at the moment or forward, and
in the process he changes history and fates of humans around him to the
better.<br /><br />I recall no other movie that has satisfied me as a human in such way as
this, in both drama, comic and thrill, with a manuscript that seems
god-made in it&#39;s completeliness.<br /><br />Only a few other movies ever made, can get close to Forrest Gump, if
you ask me!
