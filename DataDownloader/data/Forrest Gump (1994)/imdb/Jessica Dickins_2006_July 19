Forest Gump is the best movie ever for so many reasons. It made me
laugh and cry.The amazing actor of Tom Hanks.And the an amazing
directing skills of Robert Zemeckis. I am not the only one who thinks
so either because it got 6 academy awards including best picture. I
hope everyone get to see this movie at least once in their life
time.Personally I wacth it every night and have two VCR&#39;s tapes and the
collector edition DVD.In America is is rated PG-13 and in Canada it is
rated PG.<br /><br />In the words of forest gump &quot;Momma always said Life Is like a box of
chocolates, you never know what you&#39;r gonna get.&quot;<br /><br />love ya all
