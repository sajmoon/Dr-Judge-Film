After watching Fight Club, you will be a different person, you will begin
to
see life differently, much as the narrator did.  This film gives us the
audience a unique look inside the life of a man living on the edge, a man
looking for a change in his life, he soon finds that change in the form of
Tyler Durden, an exiting man who is everything the narrator whishes he
was.
Tyler shows him how life should be lived, with risks, chances, and
fighting.
You'll need to see this one twice...
