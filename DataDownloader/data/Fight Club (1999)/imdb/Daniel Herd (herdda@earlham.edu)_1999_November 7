1999_November 7 

It was an amazing mix of humor, fighting, terror, and confusion.
A look at our society and ourselves that is seldom expressed today.  This
could start a revelation, but will not because it is made by capitalists.
It will make you want to buy a DVD just to watch each frame as it appears
in
its artistic and graphic fullness.<br /><br />I felt guilty for laughing, as nothing was funny, but it was some of the
best humor I have seen in years, far surpassing the stupid tricks of Adam
Sandler or similar &quot;comedians&quot; who think humor is about degrading
themselves
or another.  In Fight Club, the humor is about degrading the YOU the one
who
is watching and laughing, it makes you hate the fact that the blood or the
suicide or the death is funny.<br /><br />The movie makes you feel guilty for paying $7.50 to watch it and $4.35 for
the popcorn you hold.  It plays on some of the ideas in American Beauty, to
leave you feeling rebellious, but subdued.<br /><br />And most of all, it makes you wonder, as you leave the theater, who is
real.<br /><br />Don't see it, watch it.
