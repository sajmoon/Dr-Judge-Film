Wow! This is what I call an incredible, fantastic, awesome HIT IN YOUR
FACE!!
This is maybe one of the most important movies made in the 90`s. Everbody
of
our generation should have seen this film! You can find yourself in the
figures of Pitt and Norton, in the way they act, talk and think. We ARE a
lost generation and we have to change something. Not in the way Tyler does,
but in our heads. Check this movie out, that`s a good start!
