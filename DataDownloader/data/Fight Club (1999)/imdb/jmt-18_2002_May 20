The one word to describe my emotions at the end of watching Fight Club was
breathless. A wonderful cinematic experience and a movie that worked on so
many levels. While the director David Fincher was famously called by Roger
Ebert `a visual virtuoso'(which is correct), this film stretches much
farther than clever camera shots and sharp editing. It tells a story that
strikes a stunning resonant chord with anyone who is dissatisfied with
their
station in life (about 90% of the world's population). The story of a
supressed American society is one that could have failed miserably but
succeeded perfectly because of the superb quality of the
acting.<br /><br />Ed Norton was blind robbed of an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of
Jack,
the protagonist, or antagonist, depending how you view the film. His
initial
disillusionment which leads to his eventual violent acts is so credible and
he switches his emotions with ease. Brad Pitt was equally effective as
Tyler
Durden, who awakes Jack from his slumber from society. I am not Pitt's
biggest fan but he shines in these types of roles. As he showed in `Ocean's
Eleven' Pitt is Hollywood's best sidekick. Helena Bonham Carter should also
be commended in her performance as Marla Singer as she doesn't simply
represent a banal love interest and (despite her dreadful Scottish accent
in
`Women Talking Dirty') gives a convincing American accent.<br /><br />What makes this movie one of the best I have ever seen is its
accessibility.
Despite the fact I am an 18 year old from South London even I could relate
in ways to both Jack and Tyler. Fight Club represents a slap in the face to
capatalist society as a whole, while Jack's and Tyler's actions at the end
of the film are unlikely to be replicated, the feeling of incontentment is
a
theme rife throughout the Western world. If only more films like Fincher's
masterpiece were made then something might be done about
it.
