This is the story of a man(Edward Norton) which has insomnia and meets
Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), an unscrupulous guy who has the guts to face
the facts.Tyler is a man not mesmerized by the illusions of our modern
society and who wants to teach others how to set their mind free
through...fighting.It's a deep movie which somehow pushes you to
disobey the system and shows that our so called rank of civilization
that we've reached is just a fake illusion which our own volatile minds
created.The beginning is not so hot but if you have the patience to
watch it until the end you will definitely see the greatest ending in
cinematographic history.Fight Club will open your mind...It changed my
perspective on life completely...
