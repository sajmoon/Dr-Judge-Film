1999_October 24 

One of the most ambitious studio movies in a long time. I will not give
away
plot details or for that matter review the movie. I will however say this:
I'm not sure how well many women would understand and appreciate the
predominately male themes in this film. Then again, its not a film for the
guy who sits there with his mind turned off. It is a very visual film but
the essence of the film is contained in Edward Norton's voice overs,
particularly in the first 30-45 min of the film. Many people I am sure will
comment on the violence but they are missing the point - it is a catharsis
of that evil which has long lurked in the hearts of men.
