Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in
only three films has already set his stamp on filmmaking.  Of course, we
didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic
&quot;Seven.&quot;
But in retrospect &quot;Seven &quot; was as bleak and despairing as anything done in
mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less.  Then came
&quot;The
Game,&quot; a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up
and
unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish &quot;game&quot; learns to live
again.  &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; a la Kafka.  This same premise is put into a societal
point of view with &quot;Fight Club.&quot;<br /><br />This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; comes to
us
via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.  The film relates the story of a
successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an
insomniac.  He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a
respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on
life.
He can't feel emotion anymore.  On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis
group
and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a
rare cancer (insert laughter here).  This bonding and emotional intimacy
leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's
ample
breasts.  Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.<br /><br />Things are moving along great.  Never mind that he's using these victims
as
emotional pumps, the point is he feels again.  Then comes an uninvited
femme
fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she
used to do Merchant-Ivory?<br /><br />Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere.
Enter
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in
his customers' soups.  These two bond by beating the crap out of each
other.
&quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can, &quot; Durden says.  Norton obliges
by
punching his ear.<br /><br />Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a
freak fire.  Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each
other.  Naturallly, other men gravitate.  Finally, a club is established
in
which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators
in a self-imposed ring.  The object:  Fight so one can feel masculine
again.<br /><br />As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what
it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban
terrorism group.  Nihilism by way of Fascism.  You see, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is
about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to
what they truly are, hunters.  Only problem is where does one draw the
line?<br /><br />First off, the positive.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is technically brilliant.
Audacious
and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's
narrator.
So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of
background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as
well.  Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.  The camera
swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his
pad
even seeing the price for each item.  The energy is infectious and the
acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are
top-notch.<br /><br />Is there any negative?  Yep.<br /><br />I felt dirty watching this film.  I felt the same way when watching
&quot;Natural
Born Killers.&quot;  Yes, it was satire as I'm sure &quot;Fight Club&quot; is as well.
But
the satire seems to be unfocused.  What  exactly is the point of seeing
guys
pummel each other and pick fights with innocents?  Does Fincher support
the
premise of violence to save souls or are they all doomed anyway?  And I
must
be getting soft, but there were scenes that grossed me out, specifically
the
human fat scene (Don't ask).  Satire does not work by exaggeration alone;
there needs to be purpose.  That's something &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; had.
Yes,
it was violent and disturbing.  But there was a point to the film.
Science
cannot curb man's morality nor should it.  What does &quot;Fight Club&quot; say,
let's
all revert back to cavemen?  Sorry, not interested.<br /><br />The ending is just plain dumb.  I will not reveal anything, but be
prepared
for pretension deluxe.<br /><br />A friend of mine compared this film to &quot;American Beauty&quot; saying that both
films dealt with changing one's humdrum existence into a life full of
meaning.  But &quot;Beauty&quot; had something that &quot;Fight Club&quot; lacked.  Humanity.
At the end of &quot;Beauty&quot;, Lester Burnham thinks he has found purpose in
enjoying life again, but he realizes that his life had purpose all along
because of his family.  Burnham comes full circle.  We never get that kind
of revelation in &quot;Club.&quot;  The selfishness in achieving nirvana through
nihilism remains and a hollowness remains at the film's
center.<br /><br />Fincher's movies are disturbing, that's just a given.  But their saving
grace, especially in the case of &quot;Seven,&quot; is their imagination and story.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; has its imagination as well.  However, because of its trite
story, I can't say it was a saving anything.
