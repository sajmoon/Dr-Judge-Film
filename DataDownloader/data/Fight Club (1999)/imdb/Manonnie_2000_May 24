I saw this great movie about a year ago, and I'm still waiting until I can
buy or even rent it. Here in Holland every other movie is brought on video
after a month or two, but I'm still waiting for Fight Club!!! Anyway, you
must understand that I really like this movie. The story is brilliant and
the actors too. I can't think of anything negative, so I just say: Best of
the best!!!
