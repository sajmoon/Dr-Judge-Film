EARLY CREATIVE MEETING, `FIGHT CLUB'.<br /><br />DAVID FINCHER: Right, I'm going to direct this movie `Fight Club' from this
book by Chuck Pa-something-or-other. It seems to have the potential to be
one of these dark brown-and-black rainy intense films that I love to
make.<br /><br />PRODUCTION ASSOCIATE: What's it about?<br /><br />FINCHER: It's about this bloke who's fed up with all the miserable stuff in
his life and needs some sort of intense cathartic experience to change
it.<br /><br />ASSOCIATE: Just like your other movies!<br /><br />FINCHER: Exactly. And it should be easy to make because the great thing
about it is, it doesn't require any kind of emotional involvement from the
audience whatsoever. They'll just watch it, marvelling at the dark
brown-and-black rainy intensity of it all, as scene follows scene follows
scene and they won't really have much idea what's going on or
why.<br /><br />ASSOCIATE: Just like your other movies! Who's in it?<br /><br />FINCHER: Well, I've had Brad Pitt playing a blank-faced, fiery, violent guy
for me before, so I've got him for the blank-faced, fiery, violent guy. Ed
Norton seems to be quite good at looking confused and ragged, so I've got
him to play the confused-looking ragged guy. And I need a fat bloke, so I've
got Meat Loaf.<br /><br />ASSOCIATE: Brilliant! What about women?<br /><br />FINCHER: Yes, I need someone to play the woman who seems a bit mysterious
and enigmatic and that, but who turns out to be a mere plot device to help
the men's story along. Just like in my other movies. In this one she's a
complete slut and druggie, at least partly psychotic, and with no interest
in real human relationships. She's a physical mess and a mental wreck. She's
whorish, neurotic, abrasive, abusive, dark and possibly suicidal. None of
your pretty-pretty rosy-cheeked actress types - I need someone who will
really live the role.<br /><br />ASSOCIATE: Helena Bonham Carter?<br /><br />FINCHER: Yes! That's brilliant! Oh, by the way, there's this great twist at
the end that's a bit stupid and unbelievable and makes the rest of the movie
even more confusing.<br /><br />ASSOCIATE: Just like your other movies! Dave, you're a
genius!<br /><br />FINCHER: Yes, I am.<br /><br />[MEETING ENDS. HELENA BONHAM CARTER IS CAST. CUE MUCH ACCLAIM AND ANOTHER
$40 MILLION FOR FINCHER TO MAKE THE SAME MOVIE AGAIN]
