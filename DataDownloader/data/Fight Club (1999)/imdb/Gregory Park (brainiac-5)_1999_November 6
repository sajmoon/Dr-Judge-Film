1999_November 6 

This film will not break the $100 million mark domestically and probably
will not even brake the $50 million. This film definitely will not win an
Oscar and probably will not even be nominated. However, this film will
stand
the test of time and will be appreciated years from now. It is
extraordinarily unusual, and it is terrifyingly prophetic in its view of
the
nature of man and society. The problem is the majority of us have been
raised up on an entirely different notion. Who is to say which is correct?
But I have to give credit to the makers for their courage to take a gamble
and create this uncompromising film which is the Fight
Club.
