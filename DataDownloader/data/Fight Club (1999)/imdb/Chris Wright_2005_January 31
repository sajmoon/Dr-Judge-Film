Simply put, this is the best movie ever. First off, lets talk about the
acting. Edward Norton gives a great performance along with Brad Pitt.
There was not ONE flaw in the acting of this movie. The writing in this
movie is some of the greatest, taking great quotes from the book. I
can't believe Fincher has not done that many movies, this is the best
directing I have ever seen. The Overall style of this movie is really
original. This movie will be a love it or hate it type movie. I think
if you are the American Beauty/Pulp Fiction type then you may like this
movie. If you hat dark/violent movies then this is not the movie for
you. So give it a try, the ending is worth it! 10/10
