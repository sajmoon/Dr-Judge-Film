Ok, I DO need to say more.  From Brad Pitt and Ed Norton on down through all
the characters, including Meat Loaf, this movie thrilled me with its catchy
soundtrack, editing, dialogue and, yes, violence.  Call me a pig if you
will, but the fight scenes really got me going.  It didn't make me want to
go outside and pound someone into the pavement, but it shocked me with its
realism.  I found this movie to be at turns hilarious, sad and
thought-provoking.  Yes, I said thought-provoking.  I don't think it's too
big of a stretch to say this could be a soul-searching type of
movie.
But hey, why over-analyze?  Get the DVD and watch the track with commentary
by Fincher, Pitt and Norton.  Laugh and enjoy.  10/10!
