This movie rocks! This is a great way to live your life, good to the
last drop. Top notch performances by Norton, Pitt and HBC. This a
movie, I've seen more times than my age of 19. Everyone needs to see
this movie, it should be in high schools. A person's lease on life, can
be improved so much by this movie. For example if you don't like
something (consumerism), don't pay attention to it. And once you've had
beers with your very best friends, it never hurts to have a friendly
fight in the front yard. The fights aren't usually long, but you
remember the best parts. The music by The Dust Brothers was a cool
touch to the movie too, as well as the Pixies. I wish i knew the other
songs from it. But seriously-a great movie! I feel proud when I show
this movie, to others, who have never seen it yet.
