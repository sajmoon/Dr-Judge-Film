Fight Club is one of those films that I think will be appreciated more as
time goes on. The story has so many twists and turns and is never boring and
the outcome is even a bigger revelation than the one in The 6th Sense. From
start to finish the film never slows down. It is mind-blowing and amazing
and the direction and other camera tricks by Fincher is top notch. Perhaps,
the most impressive thing about this flick is Ed Norton. There is one scene
that Norton's character has with his boss that is Oscar-worthy. It's a shame
the Academy, however, decided to ignore him this time. Brad Pitt, Helena
Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf also give noteworthy performances.
