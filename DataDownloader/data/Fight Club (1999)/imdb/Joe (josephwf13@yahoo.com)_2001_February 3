This is one of my favorites.  Edward Norten and Brad Pitt movies are great.
They are two great actors watch their movies, except for Keeping the Faith
(wasn't great).  This movie really makes you think about your life and the
daily events that occur.  Be prepared for an awesome twist, and read the
book based on it.
