damn, this movie was rocked my world. i left the theater searching for
someone to beat the living crap out of. this movie starts up slow and
boring, but once tyler and the girl show up, the film really grabs yur
attention. i didnt like the fact that so much of the movie was norton's
voiceover's though.
