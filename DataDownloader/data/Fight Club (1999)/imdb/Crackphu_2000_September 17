This was the most intelligent film I have seen in years and an instant
favorite.  I hope people can see past the violence of the fight scenes to
see the terrific theme of the movie.  Every guy can identify with this
movie
- it's about us, fellas.  We all feel that way in some form.  Everyone
should watch this movie twice.  Once for effect, twice for the whole story.
The cinematography was as intelligent as the theme.  That's why you need to
watch it twice.  You pick up a lot things in the background that you miss
the first time because you're so engrossed by the plot.  Pay attention,
listen to all the words and enjoy this one.<br /><br />By the way, Meatloaf rocks.
