Brad pitt takes the crucial role of tyler durden while the brilliant as
usual Edward Norton continues amazing us all with his narration.  I've yet
to read the book, but here good things.  The movie isn't for everyone how
ever there are some kind of sick parts. But still a very entertaining and
well thought out film.  One more star has a role in this film and that is
singer become actor Meatloaf who plays i kid you not &quot;B**** T**s&quot; does a
suprisly good job.  I can't say much more because i don't want to spoil it
for anyone who hasnt see it but if what i've described sounds good to you
then check Fight Club out ASAP!<br /><br />9/10
