Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents
the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow
values,
rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick
and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from
American
Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking
existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not
gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting
violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it
is
sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with
friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second
viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book.
In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own
conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've
seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures
of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that
the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the
film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should
definitely be an Oscar contender.
