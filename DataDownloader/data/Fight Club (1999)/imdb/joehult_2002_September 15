There is very little that I can say negatively about this film. The only
real complaint is it does tend to be very preachy. While watching it does
change your attitude on life, you probably feel depressed. But I did not
go
home and start tossing my electronics and anything else that had a hold on
me. Once I left the theater that was it, the movie became nothing more
than
any other movie I have watched.<br /><br />Although I can see where a few people may be disappointed, especially when
we live in an era where John Woo, James Cameron, and for the love of god
Ron
Howard are considered brilliant. Instead of the greats that have seem to
die
out in the early 90s. Anyways these people tend to be the 'have to have
everything clearly wrapped up' or they complain if more than 80 seconds go
by without any 'entertainment.' If that is what you are looking for, avoid
this movie. Also, what is academy looking for in a movie, I have yet to
enjoy a single Oscar winner since Schindlers List, stop with all these
posers and start nominating originality, or at least masterpieces. Pop art
is not worth an oscar. And just because the company that produced it is
small scale, it only means the film is a poser on top of of cheaply
produced. The only true great independent films are Fargo and
Clerks.<br /><br />Like others have said, you can watch this movie ten times and find
something
new. The plot twists alone will blow most peoples minds. Especially when
they find out a movie title fight club has a real message.
