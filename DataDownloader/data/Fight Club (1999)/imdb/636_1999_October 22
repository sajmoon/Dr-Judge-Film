1999_October 22 

This is a comedy. Although the audience did not share my sense of humor, I
laughed throughout the movie. The opening visuals set the stage for a
surrealistic journey. If you were not a schizophrenic when the movie began
then you should be a bit schizophrenic when the movie ends. Do the terms
withdrawal, hallucinations, delusions of persecution and omnipotence ring a
bell? Brad Pitt gives an amazing performance. I particularly like when his
face is covered in a cold sweat and he gives the speech &quot;You should not be
judged....&quot; with steely conviction. Edward Norton is superb as the main
character. He is so convincing that you find the ending mind blowing. In a
lot of movies the hero and heroine walk into the sunset. I really liked the
ending of this movie because they simply held hands and looked out the
window of an office tower. It was one of the most romantic moments in the
movies for an anarchist. I think it is about time that we see more movies
that attack the establishment. This movie does that just fine thank you.
Schizophrenia rules.
