2005_May 26 
I watched this movie for the first time last night, Wednesday 25th,
2005. I had no desire to see this movie before, the title &quot;Fight Club&quot;
proved that this movie was opposite of what I enjoy. However, nothing
else was on, and I had watched all of Gigli, so this couldn't be that
bad compared to it.<br /><br />This movie has EXCELLENT acting, when you are confused so is Edward
Norton's character, (so you don't feel you missed something) the plot
is good, and the purpose of this film is important.<br /><br />The main character's apartment burns down, along with his Swedish
furniture. He had lost his briefcase with EVERYTHING in it: all his
designer clothes.<br /><br />Fight Club (the actual club) encourages it's members to turn away from
commericalism, but trust, no one gets on a pulpit and preaches. It's
done subtly, thus powerfully.<br /><br />In the end, *****when the five credit card companies' buildings fall
down*****, whether or not you approve of violence, you can't help
smiling.
