I loved Fight Club, when I saw it. I read the book by Chuck Palahniuk
first and then I watched David Finchers brilliant movie. Fincher has
done great work and I can recommend this masterpiece. It's not all
about men hitting men. It's about ourselves, our souls, our
imagination. I learned a lot about people whilst watching the movie.
First, I did not want to see it, but my elder brother bought it at our
local DVD shop and asked me, if I wanted to see an extraordinary good
movie. When I heard I was about to see Fight Club, I wanted to go, but
he &quot;made&quot; me sit down and gave a bag of crisps to me. I thought
&quot;alright, just another day wasted&quot;. But I was wrong. I wanted to see
that movie a second time, so I took it home to my flat, and watched it
again and again (i think about seven times) I love this movie and I
guess, it's my favorite one!
