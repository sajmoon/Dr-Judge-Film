stealing a comment from today's front page of imdb referring to iron giant;
i believe the following applies to &quot;fight club&quot; - &quot;We can't expect the
studios to make good movies if we don't watch them.&quot;
Go see this movie! I personally don't need the box-office to signify if a
film is good or not. however, i think it's a sad statement when something
like &quot;double jeopardy&quot; is held with more enthusiasm amongst movie-goers
than
&quot;fight club&quot;. personally it makes me believe in the issues portrayed in
films like &quot;fight club&quot; even more! Like ed norton says, &quot;how embaressing, a
houseful of condoments and no food...&quot;. read in to that what you will.
besides bringing up brave issues (by the way it is very american to bring
up
issues) fight club is directed and produced superbly, the acting was
excellent, and if you insist on shutting off the thinking part of your
brain
it still look's genius and the sequencing is very creative.
