A daring life-changing satire on life in America.  David Fincher's Fight
Club is perfect on so many different levels.  One can get something
different from every viewing.  It works as a buddy flick; a satire; violent
propaganda; this movie has everything!<br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give the performances of their careers (so far).
 Helena Bonham Carter is diabolically sexy.  The real star of the film is
David Fincher's exhilarating direction, and the screenplay's wicked
wit.<br /><br />The DVD is a must.
