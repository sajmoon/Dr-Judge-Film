Why so many folks voted a 10 on this movie is beyond me. Even if you liked
it....a 10? I thought it deserved a 7.5 or so up until the half point of the
movie,then it just got plain stupid.
Without giving anything away,I thought it was a pretty cool concept that
(all too typically) got carried away during the last half
hour.
6/10
