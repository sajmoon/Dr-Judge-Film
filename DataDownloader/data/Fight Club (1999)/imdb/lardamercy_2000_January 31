To see cinema at it's best, you could do a lot worse than going to see
fight
club. Fincher's use of unusual storytelling technique in this film has to
be
seen to be believed. The performances of all the principal actors are
truly
captivating and has generated in me a deep respect for both Brad Pitt and
Helena Bonham-Carter. See this film.
