There never has been a movie like &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; before and there never
will be again.<br /><br />&#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is a great movie mixture of a great story, acting and
style. Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great
and one of a kind movie.<br /><br />Director David Fincher&#x27;s directing works effective. It gives the movie
both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want
to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and
discover some more things on every viewing.<br /><br />Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I
probably wouldn&#x27;t have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role
comes too soon after his in &#x22;Twelve Monkeys&#x22;, both the movie and his
character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the
big man-breasts.<br /><br />The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When
you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie
with street boxing. This is not the case, &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is a personal
movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the
anti-society message much like in Kubrick&#x27;s movies was the case.<br /><br />Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my
book.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
