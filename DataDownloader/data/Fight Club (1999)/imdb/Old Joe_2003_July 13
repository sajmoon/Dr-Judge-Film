2003_July 13 

While I know this movie made a big fuss on virtually the entire movie world,
I am one person whose game enough to admit that he did not like it at all.
Yet half way through it I was thinking, &#145;yeah this is ok'. However by the
end, I was confused and disappointed, as this film took me to places that I
could never have imagined. <br /><br />The mundane existence of a product liability evaluator and insomniac, who is
addicted to self-help groups, is turned upside down when he meets a
sado-masochistic anarchist who is secretly plotting to overthrow
civilisation. As their friendship grows, they become increasingly involved
in a secret society of &quot;fight clubs&quot; where men act out their aggressions and
violently beat one another to a pulp. In the meantime, the evaluator falls
in love with a woman who is also addicted to self-help groups, but is unable
to act on his desire for her. <br /><br />Director of Fight Club was David Fincher, who had done some really good
movies, such as the Michael Douglas thriller &#145;The Game' and the murder
mystery, &#145;Se7en'. Yet with &#145;Fight Club', I found myself getting more
frustrated, as the movie continued on. This I believe has to be due to the
direction of the movie by Fincher. I mean, what was the last 30 minutes of
the movie actually about? I am still unsure, do not want to know, but will
say that it did not impress me. <br /><br />However the movie's story did have some good elements. I enjoyed the idea of
an underground &#145;boxing' club, as was the scummy setting that we see the
movie placed in for the majority of the film. But the brutal, ungloved
beatings were for me, pretty hard to take, as was some of the violence that
went on after that, and as I have mentioned, I did not like (or understand)
the end of the movie, which made the film's story seem crazy for me. The
idea for the story of this movie was taken from the novel of the same name,
by Chuck Palahniuk. While the screenplay for the movie was written by Jim
Uhls.  <br /><br />The movie stars a reasonably good cast. Main star, known only as Narrator
(Edward Norton) was one character that I found myself in some way liking. He
is an angry depressed man, whose is in a frustrating job, but life is about
to have a big change. This change is due largely to him meeting up with
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler helps narrator out, giving him a place to
live. Yet he also gives narrator a look inside the weird and ugly world of
the &#145;Fight Club'. Tyler states &#145;The first rule of Fight Club is - you do not
talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is - you DO NOT talk
about Fight Club.' <br /><br />While I know that many people found both Norton and Pitt to be great
performers, I found some of Pitt's character traits to be really disturbing,
especially when he keeps inviting fellow boxers to &#145;bash him up', like the
scene where he tempts and pushes Narrator to flog him pretty bad. I also
feel that Durden's ideas behind the fight club are bit hard to take. Look I
preferred Pitt in movies such as &#145;Thelma and Louise' and the wonderful movie
&#145;Interview with the Vampire'.<br /><br />Narrator is also addicted to  &#145;support group meetings', going to one every
night of the week. This is where narrator meets a bizarre chain-smoking
woman called Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Her character brings in
the strange sexual ideas into the movie. It is easy to understand that her
character is angered by the men in this movie, who would prefer to bash each
other around, then to have sex with her. In a world set in reality, that
would be quite unusual. I enjoyed Helena's performance (and movie for that
matter) much more, in the 2001 remake of &#145;The planet of the Apes'.<br /><br />I recently had a shot at well known Chicago movie critic, Roger Ebert, for
his harsh words on the movie &#145;Dead Poets Society'. But while he is entitled
to his opinion and I am to mine, I was trying to think of the reasons why I
struggled to like &#145;Fight club', so I decided to read his opinion on this
movie. I have to agree with his conclusion, which states: &#145;&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a
thrill ride masquerading as philosophy--the kind of ride where some people
puke and others can't wait to get on again'. I have to admit that I am part
of the first group, who by the end of this film could not wait for it too
finish. I am sure that the majority of you out there were the latter,
wanting more and more. I kept looking for the ending titles, so I could end
this violent blood-bath of a movie. <br /><br />CMRS gives &#145;Fight Club': 1 (Bad Film)
