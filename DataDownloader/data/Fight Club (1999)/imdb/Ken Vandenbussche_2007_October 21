Just like that other Brad Pitt-movie &quot;12 monkeys&quot;, &quot;Fight club&quot; is so
weird that it becomes hard to fully enjoy it. Both movies are
considered classics, yet I fail to see why. A few years back, I thought
these were truly awful but in time I learned to appreciate them a
little more. Still: I simply cannot shed that feeling of disappointment
and therefore, to this date, I don&#39;t consider either one of them to be
as brilliant as some other classics such as for example: &quot;Pulp fiction&quot;
or &quot;Memento&quot;<br /><br />And it all started so well. The story is about a man who suffers from
insomnia and desperately tries to escape his boring existence. He meets
a charismatic soap salesman and starts organizing the ultimate form of
excitement with him; which they call Fight Clubs. These are hidden
places where normal young men fistfight each other to get rid of
whatever aggravation they possess. The liberating effect of these
brutal fights actually brings these men closer together and is the
beginning of a very strong yet dangerous companionship.<br /><br />The huge plot twist of this dark and controversial movie is as
unexpected as the one of &quot;The usual suspects&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean
that it is just as good. Basically: this change is so bizarre and
far-fetched that it almost entirely destroys the movie for me. I simply
couldn&#39;t bring myself into believing that a thing like that could
actually happen. Also: looking back at everything that had transpired
before, I sincerely felt that it just didn&#39;t make any sense anymore.
Furthermore: I hate movies that create a beautiful truth and then tear
it all apart instead of letting you enjoy it a little more. I like
surprises when watching a movie, but I don&#39;t like being left
empty-handed at the end of a movie. I find such dishonest endings to be
a huge letdown almost every single time.<br /><br />The acting of the two leading men is good, but I have seen a lot better
by both. Edward Norton&#39;s finest performances will most likely always be
in the two-faced court drama &quot;Primal fear&quot; and the classic, shocking
&quot;American history X&quot;. I also like him much better in some of his other
movies such as &quot;25th hour&quot; and &quot;The score&quot;. Maybe his character in this
film wasn&#39;t interesting enough but something about his acting didn&#39;t
quite get the fullest of my attention. On the other hand: there&#39;s Brad
Pitt who&#39;s acting seemed better, but even he did far more compelling
stuff in &quot;se7en&quot; and &quot;12 monkeys&quot;. The best acting performance in this
movie however came from Helena Bonham Carter. I had never seen anything
quite like this from her and she was really good. There&#39;s also Meat
Loaf in the unusual role of Bob.<br /><br />In short: If it weren&#39;t for the obscure darkness near the end, I would
probably like this movie a lot better. It certainly is a unique movie
and that seemingly makes up for an interesting experience, but the
weirdness of it all gets in the way at some point. I personally lost
touch with this film because some things don&#39;t seem to add up here.
Nevertheless: I will always recommend this movie for those who are
open-minded and eager for something new.
