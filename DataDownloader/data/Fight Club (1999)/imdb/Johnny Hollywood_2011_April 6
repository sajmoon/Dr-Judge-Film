You might as well be asking the meaning of life. Because for all the
interpretations that have surfaced about what exactly this film is
telling us, not one can be confirmed&#x85;or ruled out. Maybe it&#x27;s a
criticism of consumerism; a world of advertising that bombards us with
images of who &#x27;they&#x27; want us to be with such ferocity that we start to
believe it. Maybe it&#x27;s urging us to break free of the constraints of
society, a society we&#x27;re supposed to fear, admire, respect, serve, and
live life free. Or maybe it&#x27;s just so satiric that the preacher
himself, Tyler Durden, with his too-cool hairstyle and nightclub-junkie
sunglasses, exists only to parody the very nature of anarchy, a lying
hypocrite constantly firing useless one-liners and incoherent
&#x27;philosophy.&#x27;<br /><br />Whatever Fight Club is about, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema.
Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, director David Fincher has
created a dangerous film that exposes the intense power of the will to
change one&#x27;s life. The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) is stuck in a
dead-end job and attends support groups for the terminally ill just to
feel some emotion in his life. There he meets the mysterious and
twisted Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who has the same problem.
Desperate to make something of his existence before he dies, an
encounter with eccentric soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) gives
the narrator exactly the chance he needs.<br /><br />The characterisation of all three main characters is extraordinary. One
could argue each actor gives a career-best performance, adding
immeasurable weight to the film&#x27;s message, whatever it may be. Norton&#x27;s
deadpan narration of every painstaking moment of his life doesn&#x27;t so
much justify his actions as it emphasises them. Pitt&#x27;s character is the
one that benefits most from a brilliantly unique script that never
fails to impress, full of refreshing dialogue and devoid of any
clich&#xE9;s. Meanwhile, the consistently underrated Carter brings the
vampiric Marla to life (no pun intended), giving a marvellous turn as
the narrator&#x27;s morbid love interest who envies the dead and preys on
those close to joining them.<br /><br />I regard this movie as highly as I do because, just like the characters
themselves, it relishes in breaking all the rules. Where other movies
follow a set system of guidelines that eventually result in a film
falling into one or two genres, Fight Club dosen&#x27;t try to classify
itself, but instead tells its story without letting convention get in
the way. The film is driven solely by the narrator&#x27;s recollection of
what he and Tyler built, and if he wants to backtrack, stop time or
ignore something he&#x27;d rather not pay attention to, then the audience is
forced to do the same.<br /><br />Fincher makes it very clear that we shouldn&#x27;t forget that what is
on-screen is fiction, and that allows him to play with all sorts of
fourth-wall-breaking techniques. This gives the film a unique touch
rarely seen in movies past and present, but more importantly, it gives
the viewer perfect reason to suspend their disbelief, especially when
things get more sinister towards the Third Act. <br /><br />For better or for worse, the vast majority of people will remember
Fight Club for its blindsiding twist ending, a moment recognised in pop
culture so frequently it is almost impossible not to know it even
without watching the film. Regardless, I urge anyone who has yet to see
it to give Fight Club their full attention. And even if you can&#x27;t
decide upon exactly what it means after the first screening (like me),
you can at least marvel at the surreal cinematography, threatening
performances from all involved, and the efforts it took to create a
film so steeped in fan-dividing social commentary, psychology and
satire all at the same time. <br /><br />*There&#x27;s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So
