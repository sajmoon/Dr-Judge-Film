1999_October 14 

I saw the local premier screening last night and really enjoyed it.  The
lead performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were both excellent.  The
movie was very entertaining and quite funny in places but also had it's
serious moments and still has me thinking about it today.  I also liked the
fact that the commercials didn't tell you too much about the plot, I was
honestly surprised by a lot of the turns this movie took.  Although the
movie's probably not for everyone I think there's a large segment of the
population out there who will love it.<br /><br />(P.S. I thought the &quot;surprise&quot; in this movie was even better than the one
in
the sixth sense, none of my friends or I saw it coming!)
