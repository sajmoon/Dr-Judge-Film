Fight Club is one of the most original films that I have ever seen,
directed
by David Fincher (directed Severn, Alien3 and The Game) it has been turned
into a work of art.
The film is based on Jack (Edward Norton), a car company representative who
suffers from a bad case of insomnia. While on a plane (and the plane seen
is
one of the best scenes of the film) he meets Tylor Durden (Brad Pitt) when
he returns home and finds that his apartment has been blown up he calls
Tylor and asks if he can stay with him for a while. While standing at the
back of a deserted car park Tylor asks Jack to hit him telling Jack he will
never know what he is if he's never been in a fight. This is seen by some
people, slowly the word spreads and fight club is formed. From this start
Project Mayhem - a strike against the world - arises and Jack is no longer
sure what Tylor is planning. I wont say anything else in case someone
hasn't
seen it yet but the ending is superb and I can not wait to watch it again.
This is a great film and with so much action and quirks in it you will
definately need to see it more than once to find all the small jokes
Fincher
has put in.
