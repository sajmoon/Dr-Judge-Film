I think that the majorities' high appraisal for &quot;Fight Club&quot; reveals that
society as a whole loathes the work force, obviously.  If not, then we come
to know them as &quot;workaholics&quot;--which I can safely say because I am
one.<br /><br />On a personal level, I enjoyed &quot;Fight Club&quot; a great deal because of the
psychological implications throughout, but it also indicates a disturbing
theme as blue/white collars buy into the whole Durden philosophy with whole
abandon.  The creator of Fight Club signifies the terror of a meaningless
existence, especially retaining a Sisyphus-like mentality of waking up,
working, eating, sleeping...  In a sense, this Durden figure is the
Messiah,
liberating the people from thinking for themselves, thus confirming a
philosopher's saying that &quot;people would rather die than to think.&quot;  (I
apologize that I cannot deliver the philosopher's name due to my lack of
memory.)  With that in mind, the movie also explores the domains of a life
that can be possibly achieved once the drudgery of life is melted away, but
only first through death.  &quot;The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the
human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity -
designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying
in some way that it is the final destiny of man.&quot; (Ernest Becker in The
Denial of Death)  Perhaps the alter ego remained in the narrator's
subconscious, but gradually acquiesced as his desires surfaced and
overruled
the desires of his heart.  Opposingly, the narrator seemed to loathe his
secret desires, for it allowed him to do things that procured undesirable
effects in reality.  That is where the dynamics of this movie takes play,
as
a sinister dual personality is comprehended during the narrator's
revelation
amidst his oblivion.  Henceforth, the audience is understandably enraptured
by the subplot of dual personality as well as the nightly releases of a
pseudo-masochistic society.
