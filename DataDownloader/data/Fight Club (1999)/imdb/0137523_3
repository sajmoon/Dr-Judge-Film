I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had
read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read
the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen
the movie more times than I can remember.<br /><br /> Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on
which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan)
but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this
movie, because it broke down doors.<br /><br /> This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at
first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The
plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing
short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad
Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my
all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually
everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.<br /><br /> David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this
movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited
to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish
flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got
was so much, much more.<br /><br /> Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing,
gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh.
Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the
depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of
Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile
imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story
is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the
state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh,
you'll do all the clich&eacute;s but most importantly you'll identify with every
single thing on the screen.<br /><br /> This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if
you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the
nearest videostore!<br /><br /> 5/5
