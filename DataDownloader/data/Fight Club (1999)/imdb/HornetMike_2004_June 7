Although this is a fantastic observation on nihilism it's not this
underlying theme that makes me like Fight Club so much.<br /><br />Firstly, it's the direction - Fincher gives his films a fantastic
noir-ish feel. It's a different style to the noir of Se7en, indeed I
love how Fincher has created a noir that is not hidden from society,
but is out in modern life. It's beautifully and originally shot (and a
little beside the point, but it has a fantastic soundtrack). Secondly I
am a huge admirer of both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton who both put in
great performances here. Meatloaf, Helen Bonham Carter (an incredible
change of accent), Jared Leto and a personal favourite of mine - Eion
Bailey make an excellent supporting cast. The storyline, despite it's
deeper meaning, is fantastic. One gets a real understanding with the
characters and it's keeps you engrossed.<br /><br />A must see.
