Seeing this movie again for the third time just recently, I've
rediscovered the brilliance of this movie. A combination dark comedy,
drama, and existential-tinged narrative all in a bundle, this movie is
like no other. The multiple personality plot device is admittedly done
too many times, but it supposedly mirrors the book which I haven't read
yet. This perticular picture has the atmosphere and feel in the vein
and spirit of other &quot;society-noir&quot; films.<br /><br />Ignore the sanctimonious, holier-than-thou pseudo-intellectuals who
champion their post-modern philosopher/writer of choice (&quot;Pfft, this
film is just a ripoff of Jacques Derrida, Wittenstein, and MacGyver!&quot;).
Any book will always convey information ideas differently from a visual
medium like movies. If your in the mood for something different and
mind-provoking, give this a view.
