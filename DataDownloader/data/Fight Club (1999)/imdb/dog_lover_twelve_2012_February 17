David Fincher&#x27;s 1999 adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel, &#x22;Fight
Club&#x22; is visceral, like a punch in the the chest. It is unapologetic,
gritty, subversive, and at times blatantly sexual.<br /><br />And it&#x27;s funny. It is a story about what happens when a movement that
promises freedom becomes more constricting then confirmatory society
ever was. Think &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27; with abnormal psychology and bloody,
bone-crunching fistfights.<br /><br />The unnamed anti-hero of this film, Narrator (Edward Norton,) is a
disturbed office worker who can&#x27;t sleep at night. His insomnia presents
reality as some kind of waking dream. Well, he doesn&#x27;t look as bad a
Christian Bale in &#x22;The Machinist,&#x22; bu he&#x27;s still pretty rough in
appearance, and he can barely work up enough enthusiasm to go to work
in the morning.<br /><br />Because he works repossessing unsafe cars after fatal accidents, he
gets to travel a lot, but his life remains at a virtual standstill. All
this changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,) a nihilist rebel
who believes humanity should be reduced to it&#x27;s most primal state.<br /><br />After Narrator&#x27;s apartment blows up under suspicious circumstances, he
goes to live in Tyler Durden&#x27;s home, which must of been a beautiful
house at one time but is now repellent in it&#x27;s decay and inefficiency.<br /><br />Soon, Tyler and his new house-guest start a Fight Club, which
temporarily releases men&#x27;s feelings of inadequacy minus a few teeth,
and might seem like a great idea if you&#x27;re into boxing and WWE.<br /><br />Add the Borderlinish, suicidal Marla Singer and the men&#x27;s own twisted
psyches, and you&#x27;ve got a recipe for disaster. The first thing that
strikes me about this film is the overwhelming loneliness. Narrator is
a cynic, so much so that he alienates himself and everyone around him.<br /><br />&#x22;How could Tyler thing it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about
to die?&#x22; he muses when Marla swallows a bottle of Xanax and invites
Tyler over for a night of lovemaking.<br /><br />In my &#x27;Favorite Characters&#x22; description of Edward Norton&#x27;s character, I
said this- &#x27;like Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s character Victor Mancini, the sex
addict at the center of the book and film &#x22;Choke,&#x22; &#x27;Narrator&#x27; pretends
to hold the human race in contempt, but at the same time cries out in
pitiful loneliness, &#x22;love me, love me, love me!!&#x22; I think us cynics can
relate.&#x27; I think this is pretty accurate.<br /><br />Although his character is dark-dark, I cannot help but sympathize with
his urge to make things right after he finds out the truth about Tyler.
This is not a film for everyone. The violence comes in droves, and no
character presents themselves as noble. Furthermore, it is not really a
realistic presentation of it content, and is more stylish than literal
in it&#x27;s subject matter.<br /><br />But it makes you think while it entertains you, and I cannot really
find any movie to compare it to. It is utterly original. Note- This
film is a work of fiction and any decision to partake in an actual
Fight Club would be utter stupidity.
