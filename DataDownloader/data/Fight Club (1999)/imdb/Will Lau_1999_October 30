Edward Norton has outdone himself again! I have yet to see Norton play a
poor role. Fight Club is a electrifying movie with a great storyline full
of
twists and turns. Brad Pitt also gives an outstanding performance. If these
two guys don't get awards for these types of performances then theres gotta
be something wrong. I mean it has all three of the most important
components
to a great movie(sex, violence, great characters).
