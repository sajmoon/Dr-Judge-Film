2000_June 30 

When I saw the previews to this movie I thought it looked stupid.  When it
came out on video my brother said it was a very good twisted plot movie.
A
week later I saw the movie and thought it was great too.  I've seen the
movie three times and see things you never saw before in the last time you
watched  it.  It was the best film of 1999 in my perspective.  I say The
Beach is the best movie of 2000.  I am reading Fight Club right now and it
is good.  I read The Beach and loved that book too.
Now honestly when you first heard of this movie you expected it to be a
lame-brain fighting movie, right?  That's what I thought.  At the end of
it,
I said Oh, My God.  This was a great psychological movie.  If I say
anymore
I will ruin it for you so I'll stop here.  I would give the movie a 10
though.<br /><br />See it, please, it change the way you think about a lot of
things.<br /><br />
