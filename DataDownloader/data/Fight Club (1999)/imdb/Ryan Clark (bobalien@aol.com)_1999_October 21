&quot;How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?&quot;
Possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen - amazing direction,
cinematography, and digital effects... excellent script and great cast...
everyone should see this movie!  This is definately worthy of Best Picture,
Best Director, Best Actor (Both Pitt and Norton), and Best Adapted
Screenplay nominations when oscar time roles around...
