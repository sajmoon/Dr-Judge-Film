Here's a movie that pretends to condemn violence (by the end, Tyler Durden
is unmistakeably a villain), but it makes fighting look so cool that
thousands of people have misinterpreted its message.  Maybe I'm being too
harsh here; I've met two people who were inspired to start random fights
because of this movie, and that really irritates me (especially since they
took pokes at me!).  However, I do think that a fatally flawed message is
enough to sink a film, even a great film, and this is not quite a great
film.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there's social commentary in this movie...commentary for angry 15
year olds.  Okay, commercial society stinks, so we should rebel, we should
reform popular culture by...by...going to the basement and punching each
other out?  No, that doesn't strike me as a viable solution.  Even the movie
knows this, and it does some quick back-pedaling at the end and tells us not
to trust Durden...but he's been the hero all along!   <br /><br />So, in the end, the film points out problems but offers no solutions.  It
generates anger, but channels it in the wrong direction.  It's clever, but
it's not actually smart.  It's satirical, but it doesn't have a point. 
Violence is good, until it kills Meatloaf, and then violence is bad.  Sorry,
it doesn't work.<br /><br />As for the film's actual style...gross, innit?  So, I ask myself - why watch
a gross movie with a flawed message?  Good question.  The answer is, don't
watch it, and go find an actually good, actually wise movie instead.   <br /><br />
