When I saw a movie like Fight Club, it came to me that maybe the
society and its critics, consensus and medias are too superficial. And,
maybe it&#x27;s the underground things that ruled.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t call me crazy, cause that&#x27;s the situation Fight Club met in the
10 years of its releasing. A lot of people blamed the Oscar for
ignoring it, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary. Because, that&#x27;s the
way this movie worked. It&#x27;s transmitting negative, anti-social and
extreme ideologies to people, so by any means you shouldn&#x27;t give it an
Oscar. That&#x27;s how the whole society and movie industry keep their
agreement. But, don&#x27;t worry. Fight Club found its own way to our minds.
The movie is a trousers-striper who striped the trousers of the
consumerism society and everyone who enjoyed themselves in it silently.
So, if you feel offended by Fight Club, congratulations! It meant you
are in the mainstream and doesn&#x27;t need a change. If, more fortunately,
you are encouraged and enlightened by Fight Club, congratulations
again. It means you are exactly the targeted audiences of this crazy
movie, and you &#x27;ve just found your therapy group. It looked like there
are hardly a middle-way, if you talk it in front of the public, that
you have to either disapprove it or approve it. That&#x27;s why I liked it.<br /><br />Nowadays people laugh at you if you try to reason with them by biblical
teachings. So maybe sometimes they need something more &#x22;explosive&#x22; and
&#x22;dynamic&#x22; to challenge their life-time values. Shake it baby! Shake
your head or your heart! Anyway this movie delivered, and could be
taught for good.<br /><br />Mr. Fincher, you should give more stuff like this. Don&#x27;t worry about
the critics and the terrorists. They will be entertained as well.
