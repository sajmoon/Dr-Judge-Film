Fight  Club  begins  with  a  promising  half  hour  and  falls  downhill
from  there . Edward  Norton  gives  a  brilliant  performance  as  a
depressed  office  worker  driven  by  capitalism . He  narrates  the
film
, guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was
immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and
Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the
movie
begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the
exact
moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets
Brad
Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches
self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins
his
group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each
other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie
begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like
watching
a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple . I  was  still  hopeful
though , until  the  film  self-destructs  with  a  contrived  suprise
ending  that's  totally  contradictory  to  many  of  its  earlier  events
.
The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked ,
because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in
Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick
.
Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves
only
as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real
theme
, Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a
compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it
falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush . Seeing  Fight  Club
,
I  realized  you  can  have  great  ideas  for  films , but  unless  you
use  them  well , and  find  just  the  right  note , great  ideas  do
not
necessarily  make  great  movies .
