My friend and I were watching this movie and we noticed that we kept
seeing starbucks once in a while. So we watched scene by scene on DVD
and found starbucks in every scene except a couple. I found this type
of advertising very strange and was wondering to hear your opinions on
it. There are some scenes where there isn't a cup of starbucks and its
not like a cup is there the whole scene either. It is more like you
will see it once in the scene then you might not see it again. Some are
very hard to find and you will have to look close but they are there.
For all I know this could be old news and I might seem like and idiot
for posting it.
