I watched &quot;Fight Club&quot; on DVD the other night and was thoroughly
unimpressed.  The first 30 minutes or so are promising and funny, but
everything just goes downhill after that.  There is no point to this movie.
There is no great social message.  The &quot;climax&quot; and ending are just gross.
I give it 4/10.
