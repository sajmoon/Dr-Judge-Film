1999_December 9 

I don't believe this movie. How great he is. How spectacular he is. How
mysterious he is. The movie is made by David Fincher, one of the great
director of the decade. He made is mark in the cinema with is famous
twist-in-the-end. He have the touch, the touch of how to make a terrific.
And the performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter
are awesome. It's a completely psycho movie. But it's a movie to
see.<br /><br />My vote: 9 out of 10
