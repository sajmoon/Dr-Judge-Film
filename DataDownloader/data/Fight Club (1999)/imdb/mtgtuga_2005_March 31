How can one start to describe something that is so close to perfection?
Fight Club is, without any doubt, an epic movie. There's something in
this movie that calls for the animal in all of us.<br /><br />Violence. Raw violence is a strange thing. It frightens most of us, but
it plays a major role in the human race. This movie serves as an
excellent wakeup call. Most people tend to forget that we, Mankind, are
a species for several thousands of years, however, we are a civilized
society for just a few hundred. Our primal instincts are still very
much alive and there's some comfort, some peace of mind when you return
to your most basic needs.<br /><br />This movie puts a new perspective in our everyday life. We work every
single day to suppress our most inner feelings and we are gradually
becoming nothing more than an ant colony.<br /><br />I won't even dare to say anything about the movie plot. You have to see
it for yourself and in the end, you kinda of wish it to be true,
although it will shock you most of the times.<br /><br />If you have any sense at all, then rent this movie and see it. And
hurry up, while you still have the will power to do so.
