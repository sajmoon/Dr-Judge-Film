You know I remember seeing this movie the first time. I remember loving
the
first 2/3 of it. However, I was sorta disappointed by the final part.
However, after seeing the movie several times now I REALLY, REALLY, dig
this
movie. It is simply put one of the best social commentary films I have
ever
seen. It is really brilliant stuff. Fincher has proven himself as an
amazing visual director. This movie is truly well executed. You know this
is
actually the first time I have ever commented on a movie here at the
database. I have rated alot of movies (I plan to go back and comment on
those
too), but this is the first time I have wrote about them Simply put this
movie deserved WAY more success than it saw at the box office. It is
brilliant. There are those that hate it. However they are few in number
and
many of them have turned around like I have. If you want to see a movie
that
is different from the average mainstream crap, but also good. This is one
to
DEFINATELY check out. You'll be thinking about it days after you see
it!
