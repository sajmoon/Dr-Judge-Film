This movie is so dreary and pretentious it&#39;s difficult to sit through,
at least for me. Spoiler: I can see that a character could convince
himself that he&#39;s someone else or that a fictional character could
exist in his mind. I find it completely implausible that all the people
around him would be fascinated and inspired by his delusion while
watching him beat himself up in a parking lot, or that he would be able
to inspire these same people to help him cover up his own fictional
character&#39;s non-existence, and that they would go out and blow up
buildings for him. The screenplay asks you to believe this. A friend of
mine compared this film to Memento which has a similar belief by the
main character, but his self-made reality isn&#39;t encouraged by anyone
else except in cases where they can exploit him. Fight Club has some
interesting ideas but I&#39;d call it a mildly interesting failure.
