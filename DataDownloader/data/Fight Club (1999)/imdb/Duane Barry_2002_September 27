I would like to illustrate the meaning of Fight Club in my opinion
together
with another work of art from the last decade.<br /><br />Fight Club and OK Computer (Music Album) by Radiohead are THE masterpieces
of the 90's.<br /><br />They completely define the society of that period(*). The shallowness of
&quot;normal life&quot;. Fight Club: &quot;I am Jack's complete lack of
surprise&quot;
Radiohead: &quot;No alarms and no surprises&quot;<br /><br />The way that women have taken a different position in society which leaves
men inconfident and unsure of the role they should or can
fullfill.<br /><br />The lost generation with nothing to fight for, post-cold
war.
(*I deliberately wrote &quot;that period&quot; and not &quot;today&quot; for we all know that
this decade has gotten a very different taste since about 1 year
ago...)<br /><br />The consumer-society driven by the media telling everybody what to buy and
how much.<br /><br />I could go on for ages with themes the movie covers, but won't because I
don't have the time and you should probably figure them out for yourself.<br /><br />If you can ofcourse that is, because I have read some terrible negative
reviews here about this movie that really want to make me fight those who
wrote them.
I mean, sure the movie wasn't flawless, but how come it is that when
people
write negative reviews they never seem to have valid arguments.<br /><br />I've read things like:<br /><br />'It was boring'<br /><br />'Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot'<br /><br />'Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title'<br /><br />'Shallow characters'<br /><br />'Bad acting'<br /><br />'The &quot;twist&quot; is just plain stupid'<br /><br />'A very average movie completely lacking in the &quot;meaning&quot;'<br /><br />Arguments that are either pathetic and inconcievably dumb or just
untrue.
It makes me sad.<br /><br />If you lack the intelligence to understand a movie like this, just shut
up.
Don't watch this stuff, go rent The Gladiator or Pearl Harbor, those
movies
were made specially for you.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />P.S. if you DID like the topic of this movie I would like to suggest
watching A Clockwork Orange and American Psycho, which movies are
absolutely
not the same as Fight Club, but are somewhat related.<br /><br />
