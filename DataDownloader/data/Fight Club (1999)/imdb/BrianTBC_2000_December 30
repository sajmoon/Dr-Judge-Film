Fight Club is a very atmospheric, highly-stylized, complicated movie that
deals with the issue of existentialism through the eyes of a nameless
character deemed &quot;Narrator&quot; (Ed Norton).<br /><br />I thought that the film was all-over-the-place thematically (trying hard
to
juggle itself between Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;),
complicated, and ultimately contradictory. If the film was so much about
antiestablishment, anti-consumerism, and anti-big business, then why did
they advertise many name-brand merchandise in their film? For instance,
IKEA
had to approve of its name usage the film's script in order for them to
use
it. The film is so hypocritical. In addition, the film gets rather lengthy
and dull after the first hour. I found myself turning off the film and
doing
other things. Fortunately, I returned to it and during the end it started
to
pick back up. On first watch, the film is very confusing, but once you
watch
it a second time or at least ponder it within your mind for an extended
period of time you begin to piece things together in the very complicated
plot.<br /><br />I read a lot of reviews that said &quot;this movie made you *think*,&quot; of course
this movie will make you think: what movie DOESN'T? Even if a movie is
horrible, it will make you think, &quot;Wow, this is a horrible movie&quot; (or
something along those lines), right? So spare me with that
argument.<br /><br />Also, I read a lot of reviews from people who completely agreed with all
of
the film's hegemonic beliefs and ideologies. The idea that we are all
&quot;living in a time with no wars, we haven't had any major wars, therefore
what is our purpose,&quot; and the tired, fashionable, Gen-X notion that we are
all living meaningless, purposeless, lifeless consumer-driven, commercial,
social-climbing lives. If you *really* believe this is so and stand
completely behind these viewpoints, why don't you turn your COMPAQ
computer
off along with the SONY VCR or DVD PLAYER you used to watch the film,
leave
your 3 BEDROOM HOME, abandon your HONDA, and go to the woods, so that you
can live off the land, smell musty, eat grapes, and get mauled by a
bear.<br /><br />Stop griping and complaining about the world being a &quot;horrible,
meaningless
place&quot; and do something about it. Make your life worthwhile: go volunteer,
help out in the communities of those in need (like the inner city or even
your own community), try to make a difference instead of sipping your
STARBUCKS FRAPPACINO and watching films by overpaid actors and writers,
while you sit on your duff complaining about how screwed up YOUR WORLD
is.
