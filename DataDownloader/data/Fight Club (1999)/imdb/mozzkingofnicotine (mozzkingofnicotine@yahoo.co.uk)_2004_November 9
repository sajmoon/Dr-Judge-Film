I love this film. It is truly the best film I have ever seen. Even as
an American film I think it says so much about society (that applies to
England to) without being preachy or trying to make people feel stupid!
The film is great and the moral you leave with is even better. Everyone
in their head has some one they want to be, i know i do dream about
being a super striker putting 6 goals past Notts forest! But for the
main character that dream came true, though for most the film he didn't
no it! and the consequence of this is far worst than he could of ever
known. there is far to much about this film than i have time to say so
just watch it then watch it again. you will love it, especially listen
out for the pixies song at the end that captures the mood so
beautifully!
