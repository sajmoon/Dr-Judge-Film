When I saw Fight Club for the first time it didn't really hit me; the
significance wasn't immediately apparent to me, but upon viewing it several
times, I began to appreciate its relevance and humor.  I purchased the
two-disc DVD version and watched all of the commentaries and was amazed at
all of the things I had missed the first five or six times I saw it.<br /><br /> I know without a doubt that I am a part of the intended audience and will
never view my life, or my reality for that matter, in the same way.  I feel
I am one of the generation that Tyler is trying to reach and even though
misguided and extreme I agree with the character's philosophy.  I began to
question my motivation in life and the measure of success in it.<br /><br /> This movie may be labeled as one with gratuitous violence, but it is a
comedy; and if you don't get it then you don't get it, but if you open your
eyes you will see its evidence all around you.  And if you allow it, it will
improve your life.  It is just a great film that works on several levels;
Fincher's vision of Palahniuk's novel is a perfect match.
