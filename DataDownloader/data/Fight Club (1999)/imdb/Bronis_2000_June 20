Director David Fincher is the STAR of this Pitt/Norton vehicle. His truly
revolutionary and super-imaginative film techniques make this film
memorable. Yet the plot (or lack thereof) couldn't have won over audiences
had it not been for how the film looked. Those who take the film as an
endorsement for anarchy are missing the point. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is almost
straightforward comedy- period. The fighting scenes are decent, but
certain
scenes/special f.x. will blow the viewer away, including a stunning
opening
credit sequence and a thrilling climax overlooking a city's skyscrapers. I
won't say much more than that, because this film is unique in almost every
aspect possible. Absolutely brilliant directorial, cinematographic, and
special effect/makeup work here that merits the film as being one of the
most ambitious and exhilarating movies of the 90's. Check out the DVD to
learn just about EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about &quot;Fight
Club&quot;.<br /><br />FILM (by itself):***1/2<br /><br />DVD: ****
