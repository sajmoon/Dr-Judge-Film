1999_December 15 

I was expecting an unintelligent, violent action film based on the trailers
(not necessarily bad, but not the sort of thing I'd pay money to see), but
I
was persuaded to go and see it - and I'm glad I did. This is one amazing
film, totally misadvertised (although if it *was* advertised differently,
it
could spoil the film). This is a clever, witty, brilliant
film.
The direction and casting could not be better, and the script is sheer
genius.<br /><br />Throw away your preconceptions of Fight Club, and go and see it - you'll be
treated to something rare.
