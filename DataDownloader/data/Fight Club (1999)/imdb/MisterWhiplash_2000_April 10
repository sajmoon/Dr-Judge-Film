Chuck Palahniuck's Fight Club is a exciting, stimulating and surprising look
at a typical macho porn (coincidence to porn, at the end of the movie, look
real close for Brad Pitt's d***).  The movie circles around a man (a usual
great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as
narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by
Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way
to live is to beat each other senseless.  Soon a club starts, and a type of
fascist society of fighting men are abound.  This film takes many turns,
many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even
funny.  One of the best of the year and Fichner's best since
Seven.
