Fight Club is a genuinely entertaining and excellently produced flick. Why
fret about Plot Holes? I see that many of the reviewers here lack the
ability of the suspension of disbelief. This movie most certainly requires a
certain suspension of all disbelief and inane, pretentious skepticism. The
movie itself does not say something momentus or particularly original about
the decadence of shallow American society. In this regard it is a lot like
'The Matrix' - attempting to say something profound about our world while
still captivating those short attention span high velocity flick-loving
American audiences. Granted both Fight Club and the Matrix accomplish this
wonderfully. But also granted, both Fight Club and the Matrix textually say
things about society and reality that are at best skin deep, akin to a
particularly ambitious article pondering a mainstreamed existence you would
find in say 'Seventeen Magazine.' But, don't let that bother you. Fight Club
is well made for what it attempts, much better than The Matrix, I think.
Don't miss it! 9/10.
