i have seen it exactly 17 times and still have a hunger for it. the
starting
of the story is so lame that a person does not at all know what is in the
movie and then the movie suddenly changes in fast actioned exciting movie.
brad pitt's acting is just wonderfull and in the end they change the whole
understanding which has been made about the movie by changing the whole
story. those people who have not seen this movie you go and watch
it.
