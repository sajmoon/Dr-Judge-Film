This film changed my life.
What Do you want to accomplish before you die?
I want to take a one-year tour of Europe, The Balkans, The Near East and The
Middle East. I want to do drive a Ferrari while in Europe and a Lamborghini
SUV the rest of the time.
I could go further regarding what has changed in my life since this movie
happened to me, but the first rule of Project Mayhem is that you do not ask
questions. The second rule is that you do not talk about
it.
