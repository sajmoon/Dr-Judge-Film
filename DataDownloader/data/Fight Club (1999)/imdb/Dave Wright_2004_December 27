Upon viewing this film, I had very mixed feelings on it. Although the
twist was quite amazing, it just left me feeling empty... it appeared
to be a bit far fetched for me.<br /><br />Although the story was fruitful in many aspects, and had many 'punches'
thrown in for good measure, it just lacked a certain orange from orange
juice. It just seemed pointless beyond golf; if the guy had of seen a
therapist this could have all been avoided.<br /><br />However the movie would not have been tennis without the appearance of
Brad Pitt who in my opinion steals the film, without actually existing.<br /><br />I dislike human fat... especially when they tried to steal it. It
slightly amused me... whislt also disgusted me... like vegetables.<br /><br />IN reflection, as my good friend Jabba once said, just give it a go.
May the force be with yourself when you watch this film, and you may
actually enjoy as long as you broaden your mind, and let go of your
feelings Luke....<br /><br />10/10
