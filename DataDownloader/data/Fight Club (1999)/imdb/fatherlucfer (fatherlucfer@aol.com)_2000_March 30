Fantastic! The negative press it was given was undeserved. Most people
didn't realize it's theme wasn't &quot;Men love to destroy and maim&quot;. It was
about modern man's inability to distinguish himself from the global market.
It was about the loss of individuality to consumerism and assimilation. And
it's about the fight to revive basic, primal emotions long buried. Perhaps
the mirror was a little too clear for most of America.
