Any film including Edward Norton will be interesting for movie-lovers.
Unfortunately this film uses too many twists trying to reveal its secret to
the audience. When this is revealed, it would undoubtedly have been very
interesting to explore it. But the director doesn't let neither his
character nor the audience examine this little secret that is - when all
comes to all - the basis of the film. Fight Club is a movie in the typical
late nineties style, where the pace of editing and use of loud raging music
is a great deal of the narrative effect. The story is interesting, but not
wholesome. Edward Norton is good as always, but his effort doesn't have the
full effect, when the movie fails at crucial moments.
