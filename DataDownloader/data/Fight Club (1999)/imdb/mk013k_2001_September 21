This movie starred Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in a tale of insomnia,
testosterone, and vandalism.  It proved to be a novel concept, as well as
an
enjoyable, if not confusing, movie.  The story begins with the insomnia of
the character played by Edward Norton.  This leads him to go to recovery
groups ranging from testicular cancer to blood parasites.  This gives him
reprieve from his insomnia, but the presence of another faker leads him to
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  They begin a fight club, where disenfranchised
males go to let out their aggression on each other.  The group gets bigger
and bigger, until it gets out of control with its antics.  If you like
action, fighting, and psychological torment with a twist, this movie is for
you.
