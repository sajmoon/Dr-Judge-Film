1999_November 21 

It must be the best movie this year for me - I had not left a cinema
feeling
so exhilarated for yonks. It was brutal and beautiful. Reflective and
irreverent. Edgy and charming. Eye candy and brain fodder. And best of all,
I had not laughed so hard since Eddie Murphy stuffed a banana in a cop's
car
exhaust pipe 15 years ago. No one will look at liposuction the same way
again.<br /><br />The cinematography will inspire many ads and wanna-be's. (Think the Ikea
walk-through scene.)<br /><br />Compared to Fight Club, Sixth Sense is just a walk in the
park.<br /><br />Go watch it - again and again.
