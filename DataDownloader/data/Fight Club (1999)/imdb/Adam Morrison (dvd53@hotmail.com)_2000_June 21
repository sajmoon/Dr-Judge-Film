A loser meets a person named Tyler Durden and before you know it, they
create Fight Club in where members beat each other to death.<br /><br />Although pretty violent,&quot;Fight Club&quot; features some good acting,especially
from Edward Norton.This is the ultimate movie for people who like fight
scenes.<br /><br />Rating:**** (out of five)
