Fight Club is a bizarre film. There's no other word for it. Visually,
Requiem of a Dream is probably just as weird, but when it comes to the
message and how it makes you feel, Fight Club is in a class by itself.<br /><br />It's hard to review Fight Club without spoiling it, but I'll do my
best.<br /><br />Edward Norton's character (nameless, I believe, throughout the film) is
the epitome of the young corporate man. He works for a sprawling
company, has an expensive condo, nice clothes, and an average routine.
But life is boring--- full of anonymous people, hotel rooms, Ikea, and
TV dinners.<br /><br />Enter Tyler Durden, a bizarre and addictive man who lives in a terrible
house and is the absolute antithesis of corporate America. He is
intriguing, amazing, dangerous--- everything Edward Norton's character
wants to be. Enter Marla, a strange young woman he meets in the support
groups he attends (through a false name and a pretend illness). Enter
Fight Club--- a world of beating the snot of each other, a man with man
boobs, and driverless, careening cars in the rain.<br /><br />This is Fight Club, a movie that will grab you around the throat and
keep you awake at night.<br /><br />I'd see it again. And if you're absolutely comfortable with your life,
you should see it, too. Bizarre and amazing and incredible in every
aspect, Fight Club is probably one of the most addictively insane films
I've ever seen.
