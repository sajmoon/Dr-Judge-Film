1999_November 27 

Now _this_ is definitely a film and a half.  It features a great script,
excellent acting (yes, even from Brad Pitt), some great action scenes and
choreography and some world class directing from Se7en director David
Fincher.<br /><br />Edward Norton stars again with a performance in the same league as his last
film, American History X, and if this man doesn't get an Oscar for one or
the other, there is something very, very wrong with the
academy.<br /><br />Without revealing the twist in this film, the only thing stopping it getting
a 10/10 from my vote was a truly lame last half hour that lead to a
completely implausible and corny ending, but that can't take away from what
is a must see film.<br /><br />There are some obvious references to comic books, the holocaust and several
other events that are very well done, and the interplay between the two main
characters has shown just how good the casting was as the on screen
chemistry is there for all to see.<br /><br />Don't just watch this film.  Buy the video and watch it several
times.
