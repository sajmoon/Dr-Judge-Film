In my view, David Fincher&#x27;s loyal adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s book
&#x27;Fight Club&#x27; is the best movie ever made. I&#x27;ll keep this piece short as
I do not want to spoil any of the brilliant moments in the film, but
the direction, acting, cinematography, soundtrack and in particular the
script are incredible, hilarious and horrifically insightful into
modern day male aggression in our society. A stereotypical &#x27;blokes
movie&#x27; is in actual fact a stupendously brilliant piece of cinema, and
although its appeal will avoid the more squeamish of viewers, this hard
hitting film as far as I&#x27;m concerned should be shown to everyone who
has the slightest interest in films, male or female, as an example of
how Hollywood can be successful not only as a money making machine, but
as clever and insightful tool that entertains as it does dazzle. Oh and
the twist ending...Incredible.
