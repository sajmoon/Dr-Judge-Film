As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year
2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight
Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in
modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting
philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.<br /><br />Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it
challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up
all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle
philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just
truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no
positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of
destructive concepts.<br /><br />The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was
great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham
Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making
dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director
David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film
along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who
should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with
short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing
perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person
experience in his book.<br /><br />Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those
who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary
masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the
destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.<br /><br />10/10
