My brother rented this movie one night and when he got home i though &quot;damn
another kung-fu movie&quot;.
I did&acute;nt have high hopes for this movie but i soon got in to it, brad and
edward are making supernatural performances.
In the end of the movie i said to myself &quot;damn, long time since I saw a
movie as good as this&quot;.
I gave this movie a 10 but it deserves a 20!
