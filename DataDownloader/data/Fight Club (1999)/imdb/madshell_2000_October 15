<br /><br />After viewing this film, I begin to wonder if the filmmakers want us to
believe that every man wants to ultimately rebel and then flog themselves to
near death for doing so.   Evidently, they have that vision of despair; that
lack of faith in humanity.<br /><br />Perhaps some call it artistic expression, but pure cynical humour, to me, is
self-indulgent garbage.   All it does is propagate more confusion in a
blatant refusal to understand.<br /><br />Where Se7en had brilliance -- in the display of the seven deadly sins, the
clarity of each character, the horror of the consequence of action -- Fight
Club almost displays the horror of human life itself, and that's just plain
bad art.<br /><br />Yes, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are wonderful in it.  But why are they in
it? <br /><br />If the filmmakers are so unhappy with themselves and humanity, they should
at least give us a vision of how they feel things SHOULD be!  Or let someone
else get greenlighted that can at least appreciate something about humanity.
 Sell your soap somewhere else.  I ain't buying it!<br /><br />
