I am studying this film at the moment to do with camera angles and
stuff but when I was doing this the film that I loved before became
even more loved by me. Just subtle things that Fincher Puts in are
amazingly effective. If any one is interested in this they should just
watch it with sound off subtitles on and think about it. the acting is
stunning with IMO Career bests from Pitt and Bonham Carter and
supporting casts are also great even with little use. The story is a
fantastic one which twists and turns and allows more and more viewings
and even demands them in parts. It is shot mainly in a dark setting
that emphasises what is going on and really really adds to the
atmosphere of the piece. Just an amazing piece of cinema that will
really make people think for years to come... <br /><br />Best Film ever
