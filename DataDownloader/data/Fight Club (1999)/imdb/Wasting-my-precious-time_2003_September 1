Based on the superb book of the same title, Fight Club sees Edward Norton
and Brad Pitt turn in the performances of their careers. The nameless
protagonist(Norton)who we'll call Jack (for reasons apparent in the film)
finds himself at odds with his own consumerist lifestyle and when insomnia
creeps in he seeks solice in the pain of others by attending multiple help
groups. He meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter sporting a pitch perfect
American accent)and it isn't long before Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)steps in
and turns Jack's world upside down with his twisted philosophy. Together
they form Fight Club, a place where old and young men alike can unleash
their inner frustrations upon each other. <br /><br />The fact of the matter is that while there are plenty of other such
controversially violent film out there, none handle the issues and themes as
intelligently as Fight Club does. It's an ingenious plot swimming in
incredible ideas about society and it's psychological effects. Fincher's
bold and stylish direction is nigh on perfect. The script shines, i could
quote Tyler Durden forever. This truly is a film unlike anything else i have
experienced and i get the feeling will remain so for quite a while.
