1999_November 4 

What can I say, other than wow. This movie defies belief of everything I
hold holy. Back in 96, when the book, FIGHT CLUB was released, I read it. I
loved it. Then, four years later, what do my wandering ears hear, but a
movie is being made of one of my favorite books of all time. So i go to see
this movie, thinking that no matter how far they actualy stray from the
book
, it will still be a good movie. Imagine my suprise when the movie was
almost exactaly like the book. I love this movie. I love this book. Read
it,
start seing things differently. I know i have.
