&quot;How much do you know about yourself if you&#39;ve never been in a fight?&quot;
This tagline from Brad Pitt&#39;s (Thelma and Louise) character Tyler
Durden is both intriguing and controversial, a great set up for one of
the best psychological dramas of the 90s.<br /><br />Pitt stars alongside Edward Norton (American History X) who plays the
narrator, a guy who is struggling with life and seeks solitude from
self help classes. And one night, he meets Tyler Durden, a strong and
powerful man who shows him what he can do with a little enthusiasm and
force.<br /><br />As the narrator, Norton excels as he dives deep within his soul to
reveal how depressing his life has become. Pitt&#39;s strong and forceful
portrayal of Tyler Durden is excellent and shows the difference between
the two characters. The opposites include the positive and the negative
thinking between the two, the strong and weak and more so, the over
thinking and the getting on with it mind set, a true portrayal of what
goes on inside a person&#39;s head.<br /><br />From the director of seven, David Fincher brings a succinct portrayal
of a person&#39;s mind to the audience with a fast flowing and consistent
use of excellent shots. Fast flowing montages are used to create a
representation of how life can go by quickly and the use of flashbacks
is also a powerful motive to represent life and time.<br /><br />The brutality behind the fight club is strong and again shows an
incentive that the mind can create.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd) is also excellent in her supporting
role as the depressed Marla Singer and the juxtaposition of her and The
Narrator shows a dark side of attraction and togetherness.<br /><br />The plot is consistent and very succinct on its issues of violence and
Pyscological. The setting s are superb, being especially dark creates
the mood and tension which were definitely needed. Though I was
personally slightly confused by the ending, it was a remarkable film
and again, one of the best dramas that have ever been filmed.
