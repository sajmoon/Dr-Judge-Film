This film is so screwed up! Picture yourself in the mind of a very sick and
insane individual (the Narrator.) There you have the gist of Fight Club.<br /><br />In short, it's about the Narrator and his split personality starting up a
&quot;fight club&quot; and also rigging up bombs all over town for some reason. The
twists are huge, and are somewhat freaky, and does make it kinda hard to
follow in this one. I got in at about half way through this film, so when I
started watching, I was so utterly confused. <br /><br />
