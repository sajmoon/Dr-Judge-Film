1999_October 15 

Another of David Fincher's tiresome gay 
fantasies involving rough trade with shaved 
heads, and one pathetic female outsider.  
(Think Alien^3.)  Lots of muscles, sweat, 
grime, adrogyny, faux-noir scenes.  Hey,
David -- been there, done that, still bored
to death by it.<br /><br />You know, actually, it was on its way to 
becoming a nice, different kind of thriller, 
but the writers apparently ran out of ideas 
and turned it into a groaner.  I literally 
groaned and shook my head, and stayed only 
to see how it ended.
