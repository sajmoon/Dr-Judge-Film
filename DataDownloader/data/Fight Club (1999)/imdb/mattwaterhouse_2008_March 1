I could lie to you and say that I hated this film. But I would feel
dirty if i did that. This is the best film ever, and i&#39;v seen the
Godfather (no. 1 according to IMDb).<br /><br />Everything works. All the performances are top notch, Edward Norton is
fabulously understated as the lead, Brad Pitt brings Tyler Durden to
life in a way that proves that the guy ain&#39;t just a pretty face. Helena
Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto excel, especially The Loaf,
because he is an incredible actor that deserves more credit than he
gets for his acting.<br /><br />The twist, although I guessed it halfway through, is brilliant, and
David Fincher brings the whole thing together like the Mona Lisa. If I
summed up this film in one word, I could think of none but
Sen-effing-sational. WATCH!!!
