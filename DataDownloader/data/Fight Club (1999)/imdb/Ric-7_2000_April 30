2000_April 30 

The film is very well made, with inventive directorial touches that actually
help rather than hinder: such as the bit about adding subliminal porn, and
the 180 degree quick pan, done vertically rather than horizontally.  In this
140 minute film, after the big plot twist occurs, there is not nearly enough
remaining time to explore the resulting situation (but that would be a
different movie).  The problem is that the film is unremittingly gruesome
and at times, physically unpleasant.  I wouldn't want to watch this again,
not because it is a bad film, but basically because I hated it.
