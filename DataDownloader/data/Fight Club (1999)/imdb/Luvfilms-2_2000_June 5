I agreed with my husband to rent this movie if he would also rent a &quot;chick
flick&quot; for me! I was very pleasantly surprized by this movie. Edward Norton
is wonderful as always, spinning his character's web around the viewer until
Wham...he gets you! Helena Bonham Carter was outrageous! I think of her in
period pieces like Room With A View, Howard's End or Twelfth Night. She is
the perfect anti-social, bi-polar, opinionated, cheap chic urban wench. Brad
Pitt was &quot;over the top&quot; (even his clothes are oddly in your face) as the
fight club co-founder -which was exactly the right portrayal. Meatloaf was
also notable as Bob.<br /><br />The final minutes of the film, you begin to put it all together along with
Norton and wonder why you never saw it before! I usually can spot a plot
twist a mile off but this was superbly done. Don't miss this movie because
you think it will be just another testosterone flood.
