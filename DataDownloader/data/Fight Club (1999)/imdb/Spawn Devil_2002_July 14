I would have to say that Fight Club is probably one of my most favorites
movies because everything about was good. The actors, the story, and the
action were all well done. This movie I would for sure recommened to all the
true critics. I hope David Fincher make a sequel to fight club because it's
worth it. He is probanly one of my favorites directors now. I give this
movie a A+
