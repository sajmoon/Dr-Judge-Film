I am a 15 year old girl and i think fight club is one of the greatest films
ever made. One reason I like it so much is because of the message it gives
us, the whole film isn't on fighting. There all kinds of emotions that go
with the film. Another thing I liked about fight club is the plot twist,
which i wont tell because that is the big surprise, it is pure
genius.
