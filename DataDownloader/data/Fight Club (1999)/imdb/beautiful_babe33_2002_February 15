It's the best movie I have ever seen. The plot twists, the action and lets
not forget tons of topless Brad Pitt. Edward Norton's acting is out of
this
world. Brad Pitt is fantastic. If you like Brad Pitt you'll die after
seeing
this movie. He is so incredibly sexy its unbelivable. Edwards Norton's a
cutie so if you like movies that are good and have attractive men in it I
suggest Fight Club. Guys can also watch it due to the amount of
action.
