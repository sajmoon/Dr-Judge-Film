This is one screwed up movie. It will blow your mind. No other movie has
depicted human desire and self hate in this way before. It's a must see
movie, it's a masterpeice. It's one of the best movies ever. It's not just
about fighting and violence, it's about what we are as humans. It's about
materialism and power. It's about insanity and misery. It's just wicked,
it's un-believable. SEE IT, you will never see things the same way
again.
