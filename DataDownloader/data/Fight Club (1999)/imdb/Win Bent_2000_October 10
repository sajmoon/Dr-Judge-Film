It's not ALL style and NO substance, but the film makers obviously were much
more concerned with looking cool than with presenting a story which held
together or had a consistent level of reality-vs-fantasy. The surprise twist
towards the end was very clever, but the more I thought about it, the more I
realized that it didn't explain a large number of earlier-on scenes and
situations. But hey, it's cool! Dazzling camera work! Astonishing effects!
Grooving music! (Sorry, folks, that's great for a TV commercial, not a
feature film)
