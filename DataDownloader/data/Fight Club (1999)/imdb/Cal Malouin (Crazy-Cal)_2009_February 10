I like to think of myself as a harsh rater, I hardly ever give a movie
10 stars, in fact a great rating from me would be and 8. But in case
you have not yet noticed this movie was a no-brainer, 10 stars for me.
I have watched it over 25 times and have not yet got board of it.
Before this I have not yet seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in anything
really good. But now I think their geniuses... There are movies that
have their twists, but not usually ones these big. And not only that
but there are little clues along the way that it is coming, then
eventually everybody in the room gets it and it is just shocking. If
you have not yet seen the movie then go out and get it right away, in
fact just go ahead and buy it! I can&#39;t tell you how much I am exited to
see &quot;The Curios Case Of Benjamin Button&quot; for it is by the same director
and includes Brad Pitt.
