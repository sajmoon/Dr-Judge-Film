I had high hopes for this movie, but I was SEVERELY disappointed.  1.5 stars
out of 4.  And those 1.5 stars are for some impressive visuals and the great
acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.  The first 90 minutes were OK, but
the last 45 minutes were truly hard to bear due to a ludicrous plot twist
that completely made me lose interest.  An overly long film about
self-destructive people with no redeeming qualities doing self-destructive,
irresponsible things.  Many people loved this film because it 'spoke to
their generation'.  God help us all if that's the case.  Being
anti-consumerism and anti-materialism is fine.  Being pro-assault,
pro-vandalism, pro-fatalism, pro-self-mutilation, and pro-anarchy strikes me
as a bit &quot;out there&quot;.  The film isn't entertaining or enlightening, and the
last 45 minutes kept it from being thought-provoking.  Director David
Fincher succeeded with another gritty, edgy film in &quot;Seven&quot; (1995).  See
that one instead of &quot;Fight Club&quot;.
