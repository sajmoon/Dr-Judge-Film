David Fincher has created another masterpiece.  To call &quot;Fight Club&quot; a
movie
is almost an injustice.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; has about as much in common with
&quot;Casablanca&quot; that a calculator has with a supercomputer.  David Fincher
said, &quot;You don't watch this movie,  you download it.&quot;  This is not a reel
of
film, it is a tidal wave of visual and sonic data that is meant to
overwhelm
you as much as the banality of an IKEA catalogue or Tyler Durden's
worldview.  Not to mention the absolute BEAUTY that is the final scene of
the movie.  I will never forget that picture.<br /><br />Not only does &quot;Fight Club&quot; knock your on your gluteus maximus mechanically,
but it tells a riveting story.  I always knew there was something
intrinsically sinister about IKEA and corporate America, and have read many
books and seen many films about the topic, but &quot;Fight Club&quot; articulates it
in a way no other story has before.  If you have ever been frustrated with
your girlfriend, job, family, or home...SEE THIS MOVIE!  You are not
alone.<br /><br />Not to mention the actors and the dialogue in the film.  Ill always hold
dear
such libes as &quot;We were selling their own fat asses back to them,&quot; &quot;Only
after you lose everything can you risk anything,&quot; and, the ultimate, &quot;I
wanted to destroy something beautiful.&quot;  Ed Norton is great, but then he
always is.  Brad Pitt is more charismatic than he's ever been, and Helena
Bonham Carter IS Marla Singer.  Casting could not have been more perfect.<br /><br />I hardly ever think a movie adaptation is as good as the book, but David
Fincher has made good on every level of the book's cinematic promise, and
proven yet again he's the most brilliant new (I still consider hin new,
it's
only his fourth film) director in Hollywood.  I count the days until his
next project hits theatres.
