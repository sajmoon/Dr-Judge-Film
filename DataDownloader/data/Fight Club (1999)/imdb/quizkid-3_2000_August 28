This movie was absolutely mind-blowing.  I had to give it a 10 for lack of
a
selection called &quot;The Matrix&quot; in the voting menu. Oh well. If you haven't
watched this movie at LEAST twice, you're sorely missing out.  Every time
you watch you catch something new that was set up for you to see, but you
obviously DIDN'T.  I slap myself every time I think of how obvious it
was...
DUH!
