FIGHT CLUB / (1999) ***<br /><br />Viewing &quot;Fight Club,&quot; the new drama by assertive director David Fincher,
is
like walking through graffiti-laden streets of a crime-ridden suburban
city;
it is dark, brutal, gritty, troublesome, and hostile. This film is all of
those things, but in this circumstance I use such adjectives to the
production's credit. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a coarse, unpleasing journey into the
lives of its narcotic characters, but it is for those exact same reasons
why
I find myself recommending the movie to audiences with strong stomachs. If
this film was anything but what I have already described, we would be
appalled at such deserving controversy and violent content contained. The
hostility of  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the main factor of which why it succeeds;
the
raucous style contributes in making a convincing, entertaining, and
recklessly original story.<br /><br />Edward Norton stars as the movie's narrator, an insomniac spending his
petty
days working in an office and sleepless nights seeking out clinics in
which
he provides comfort to those less fortunate than he. One of the people he
meets is an overweight but gentle pedestrian named Robert Paulson (Meat
Loaf), a victim of testicular cancer. He also meets a sleazy, foul-mouthed
drifter like himself named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter).<br /><br />Norton's character development is quite unusual; although effective and
versatile, the introduction, as is with the rest of the movie, is
extremely
bleak. It is as if the characters are creating an anti-society story
through
some perverse behaviors. We witness the movie through the Narrator's point
of view, who ends up explaining more of the plot than necessary.<br /><br />During a plane flight, our undervalued narrator encounters a cocky and
well-dressed soap sales representative named Tyler Durden (Brat Pit),
whose
sarcastic and outspoken notions create a charisma between both
individuals.
Shortly afterwards, the Narrator's apartment blows apart, leaving him
nowhere to seek shelter but with Tyler. This enigmatic man then organizes
an
underground sensation called Fight Club, in which young men inquire
pleasure
out of beating each other into bloody carnage. This secret society,
located
in the basement of a local bar, allows its members to find self-discovery
and freedom through brawls and scuffles.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is crafted stirringly from structured innovation to
production
designs. Art director Chris Gorak, production designer Alex McDowell, and
cinematographer Jeff Cornenweth capture the film's subversive atmosphere
with vivid detail and descriptive style and dazzling lighting techniques.
Costume designs by Michael Kaplan contribute to the development of Tyler
Durden with distinctive, creative outfits.<br /><br />David Fincher is currently one of my favorite directors. His striking and
suspenseful thrillers &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; captured my attention
thoroughly with sharp characters and focused narratives. &quot;The Game&quot;
detailed
a wealthy executive immersed in confederacy who must overcome a variety of
challenges to survive. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is more or less the same topic, in
which
a rebellious benefactor assists in taking charge of his lack of freedom
through violent encounters. This production contains plot twists and a
climatic resolution that may require more reasoning and thought than the
majority of an audience will be willing to submit.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; contains enough extreme graphic violent content for several
movies, yet few characters end up with severe injuries. When a tough young
man beats someone's face into the ground, resulting in so much gore he is
hardly recognizable, you would expect that person to end up in critical
condition at the hospital. However, many characters in this movie engage
in
uncultivated attacks but appear in modest condition the following day. I
guess this movie centers more on its theme than the character's actual
course of action, which is obligatory for success.<br /><br />Brad Pitt captures Tyler Durden with a macho, politically incorrect
attitude; he is the right choice for his character, with a hunky physical
appearance and appropriate style, this is one of the actor's career peak
performances. Edward Norton proves he is more qualified in productions
like
this and &quot;American History X&quot; rather than light-hearted romantic comedies
like &quot;Keeping The Faith.&quot; He apprehends the difficult character with
proficiency and sophisticated detail.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of the more difficult movies I have reviewed in quite
a
while. With its contentious messages, studio hype, audience anticipation,
and the actual film itself, you are reading a strenuously written
critique.
My reaction to this movie was a mixture between startling amazement and
baffling perplexity, furthermore, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a production containing
ideas audiences will be discussing long after its finale; it is the kind
of
movie that may require seconds helpings for some inquiring viewers.<br /><br />
