1999_October 30 

Most people will interpret this film as an ultra violent male fantasy.
That's not what it is, though.  It's a vision of human angst and bitterness
at the way things are.  It's the kind of movie that makes you think.
That's
always good, in my book.<br /><br />The setup of the movie, actually the entire first act, is movie making in
top form.  The punch line (sorry), is difficult to watch, and the message
of
the movie will get lost here, for most viewers. Technically, there are some
real gems here.  The visual composition (did I really just say that?) and
the special effects really amazed me.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this movie is amazing.  Dissected into parts and examined
out of context, it's will be just another reason to hate movies.  You can
dislike an idea represented in a movie and still like the movie. People
often forget that.
