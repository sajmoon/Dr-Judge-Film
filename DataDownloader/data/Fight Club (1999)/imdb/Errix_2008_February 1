The biggest problem of this movie is that it is so overrated. For years
and years I have been hearing how amazing this film is. Two times I
watched it, two times fell asleep. Was too tired probably. Today I
watched it again, once again expecting something great, and again fell
asleep. I started watching it two hours after I woke up after a 9 hour
sleep!<br /><br />Face it, this movie gets really boring at times. Pitt is often mumbling
useless phrases, dull story (after the two get together) and there is
an illogical ending.<br /><br />But for me the most disturbing is the whole idea of changing your life,
becoming sensitive again(what??) by engaging into bloody, futile
fights. Who would do that? You wanna fight, go to Darfur and fight for
the starved women and children getting raped and killed every day.
Trust me, you&#39;ll make your life interesting, you&#39;ll escape this
&#39;&#39;stinking&#39;&#39; consumer society and on your way might just save someone&#39;s
life or raise a few eyebrows. I am not from USA and not really aware of
this &#39;&#39;horrible&#39;&#39; life of the American white collar worker, but if this
movie has &#39;&#39;opened your eyes&#39;&#39; then my friends you really are in it
deep.<br /><br />On the good side the movie is very stylish and the acting is first
class. 7.5/10 just for these attributes. However since the movie in my
eyes never lived up to the hype; &#39;&#39;different, disturbing,
entertaining&#39;&#39;, its a 6/10.
