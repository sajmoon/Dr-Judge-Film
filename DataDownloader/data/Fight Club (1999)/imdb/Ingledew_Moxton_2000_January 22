This film was marvellous, the whole fight club mentality was set up very
well and extending it from there, the code of silence which was involved led
what seemed to be a lot of people across the country down the path of
Terrorism/making things equal.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were excellent choices as their respective
characters providing the hiearchy of the Fight Club, with Helena
Bonham-Carter playing a character which was far from 'English Rose'
material.<br /><br />The film itself had bits of humour, lots of action and general violence, a
strange idea of a club of fighting people that suddenly got organised and
went on terrorist-type activities with a twist in its tail.
