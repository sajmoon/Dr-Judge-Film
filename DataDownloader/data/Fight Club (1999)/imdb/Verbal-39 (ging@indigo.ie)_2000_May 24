Fight Club is truely an electric film. From the amazing intro right up to
the end, there is no denying that Fight Club is like no other film you have
ever seen. Shot with Fincher's scorching style, be amazed wit the floating
cameras, hopping reels, zooming microscopic lens, fake reel dots, subliminal
images and set pieces moving so fast, if you blink you might miss it. The
story itself is slightly disturbing, but it is shot in a sort of  sarcastic,
satirical way (helped greatly by Norton's brilliant narration). Fight Club
is at times dark, disturbing and horrible and of course, without any doubt -
controversial. Our narrator (Jack) is a clinically diagnosed insomniac and
narcaleptic who seeking some way of escaping his pain, finds comfort in
going along to support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis
or brain parastites. All goes well untill he meets his match, Marla Simmons.
But things go well again after he meets Tyler Durden, who he sets up a
Fighting Club with. Things go awry after a while though when Tyler's
ambitions rise above that of a Fighting Club and he goes for Project Mayham
and begins building an army. The film explores many dark subjects. It is
impossible to look at the film as just one subject, it is more like a lot
bunched in together. It explores man himself. As in much of the great
Stanley Kubrick's films, Fight Club explores the messed-up head of our
narrator and tries to find means behind his madness (namely his chronic
insomnia). The film  explores the eye of an insomniac, schizophrenic,
narcaleptic madman and the way he sees his life. The most memorable scenes
are towards the begining where Jack tries to explain what it's like not to
have slept in 6 months. &quot;Everything is just a copy of a copy of a copy ...
everything else gets the volume turned down.&quot; These words of wisdom are
accompanied by neat visuals, such as close ups of the copier moving back and
forward and of his boss chatting with him with (you guessed it) no sound.
And one of the most impressive scenes where Jack is staring blankly into his
waste bucket at work, soaring majestically through the names of Starbucks,
McDonalds .. etc. This is where his hatred of corporations first pops up and
is one of many hints to the unpredictable outcome of the film. It's one hell
of a film, played out to perfection by the leads (notably Norton) and shot
in a scorching style that only Fincher could pull off and with one hell of a
background tracking by the Dust Brothers. Sir Fincher, we salute
you.
