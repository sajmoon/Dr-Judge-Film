The masterpiece movie, Fight Club, is rather an interesting movie. If you
have ever seen this movie before, watch it again and pay close attention,
and once you have done that, watch it again and pay closer attention, you
may be surprised by what you see, I guarentee it. Fight Club is beleive it
or not, closely related to fascism and the ways of Adolf Hitler. If you
ever
have time, you should study up on what Hitler said back in WW2, and then
compare those words Tyler Durden (from Fight Club) used in Fight Club.
There
is much, much more interesting things on how much Adolf and Tyler have in
common. Check it out sometime, you'd be surprised.
