Fight Club is quite simply one of most thought-provoking and strange
films I have ever seen and because of this I just love it and rightly
belongs to be this high in the top 250. The main reason it's that good
is that it tells us that even if you are in a total dead end in life
and decide to turn it around it doesn't mean things will get better if
fact it gets worse in this film.<br /><br />The plot is like this our narrator (played by Edward Norton), but I
think his name is Jack, is board out of his brains, with his job and
life. So he takes very strange actions to make his life more bearable,
in which it reaches a point that his condo blows up. Before this
happens he meets Tyler Durden (played brilliantly by Brad Pitt and in my
mind his greatest performance so far), who has the most twisted takes
on life and values like for example there's a line that goes
&quot;Self-improvement is masturbation, self destruction is everything.&quot;<br /><br />One great scene is when Tyler gives us the rules of fight club for the
first time and I bet that scene will be replayed for years to come.<br /><br />As the loss of blood rises and the line of realty gets more blurred,
things get more interesting when Marla Singer comes along (played by
Helena Bonham Carter) and when you see her on one level you want to
spit in her face, but on another level you feel rather aroused by her
at the same time.<br /><br />Finally I will say this just watch this film, because it will change
your look on life in the most strange way and it also had one of the
greatest plot twists ever and trust me you will be blown away by it.<br /><br />WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!
