STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A
Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br /><br />This is my second attempt to get my review of this,one of my favourite
films
in ages,across,and,having purchased a copy today,I once again absorbed
what
a tremendously defiant piece of modern urban literature this is.Fight Club
scoops up the sad,soulless air of generation surrounding us in the
nineties
better than any other modern artie film around.Not a scene really goes by
when the entertainingly bleak,unashamedly honest depiction of any modern
society's ceaseless decline into mediocrity is'nt captured.<br /><br />Psyical,hand-to-hand violence is really the main sort of violence that's
destroying what I can see of society today.Yet,as the twist towards the
end
unravels,we responsibly learn that we all deep in our hearts probably
think
and feel like Tyler Durden does,but that if we really exacted that kind of
revenge upon society,it would really get totally worse,and we should count
our blessings for at least the safe world we live in.Sort of a quiet
warning
to many of the audience members who feel like Edward Norton's character
Jack
does.<br /><br />But,on the other hand,another lesson of this film is that you should never
think you're any better than anyone else no matter what.Someone with a
degree in social science may more than likely have a better payed,more
renowned job title than someone who collects litter,but no matter
what,they're both still people,with the same feelings,and the same
acknowledgement to pain.Really,films like Fight Club can make a difference
in more ways than one ,depending on which way you interpret
them.Imperfections and the rat race may decline if films like this are
taken
as seriously as they can be,but some idiots in the audience will obviously
be as inclined as ever to think that physical,and other violence is the
answer to everything,and observational literature like this will of course
go completely to miss.<br /><br />Meat Loaf fares his best ever post-singing performance in this,as Jack's
slightly dumb,impressionable friend,although as he's not the main star of
the show,he does,as ever,get very limited screen time.By the end,virtually
all the members have become and accepted their posistions as
soulless,plodding drones,who're happier to be like that with this cult
than
they would be with any thing society has to offer them.<br /><br />But the exceptionally good film it is,remember Fight Club is only a movie
at
the end of the day.Soon,hollywood will make others,spend ages making you
wait anticipating the completion of it's production,make you wait further
for their release date,promote it until you can't get it out of your
face,then you'll see it,they'll take your money,you might think it was all
a
waste of time,they or the cinema manager's don't care,then the process
will
repeat itself,again,and again,and again,etc.etc.etc............*****
