Mundanity gets us all at some point or other. And this movie portrays
all that you might wanna do in the sub-conscious. Character Tyler is
neither a hero nor a villain. He's you when you wanna tear apart from
the onerousness, brilliantly played by Brad Pitt. Edward Norton also
rises up to his role of a confused, tractable white collar guy. The
aura of the fight club they build together is amazing. The ten rules of
the fight club grant exclusivity to only those who appreciate the
spirit. Although the Multiple personality disorder part, filling the
climax, could have been played a little down by the director. It's not
the blood that is lying on the floor, its the similar motives,
incentives and feelings that entail our being today, that mix
flawlessly like the blood from two bodies; what remains is you.
