Couldn&#39;t you have refused? Really? Didn&#39;t you know there&#39;s a sort of
sick desperation in your laugh? If you want to be financially
successful, socially apt, and firmly on the career ladder, then this
would be dangerous film to watch. David Fincher takes your
long-forgotten playground rules, grows them up ten years, and cracks
open a beer.<br /><br />Compelling performances by Norton and Pitt punch out an epic narrative.
Carter and Meat Loaf support respectively with barbed comments and
unruly slugs. They force you to ask, &quot;What do I expect from this film?&quot;
Imagine watching this film by yourself - it was a break in exam
studying when I did - and expecting a John Woo action film. Feel
yourself sucked into the film&#39;s brutal logic. Hear Tyler Durden
shouting, <br /><br />&quot;All the ways you wish you could be, that&#39;s me. I look like you wanna
look, I f**k like you wanna f**k, I am smart, capable, and most
importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.&quot; <br /><br />Of course, the film is carefully packaged to appeal to a certain
audience. Let me say I&#39;m happy to be part of that audience.
