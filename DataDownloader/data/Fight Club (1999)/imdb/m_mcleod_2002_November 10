Fight Club is the most original, idealistic movie of the 21st century thus
far.  The acting is well-played and honest to human emotion.  The story is
insightful and flows well.  This movie put Brad Pitt and Edward Norton on
my
favorite actor list which includes the likes of Tom Hanks, Kevin Spacey,
and
Denzel Washington.  See this movie if you need a cool story of human
insanity, enlightenment, and self expression.  It won't let you down!  The
script of this movie is literature.  I give it a ten, because you know a
movie's good when you can watch it over and over again without noticing
how
bad your ass hurts from sitting to long.
