You are a genius, there are nodody like you, I think you maybe can get
frustrated because it seems that nobody understands your movies but that&acute;s
because your not making movies following rules, you are inventing your own
rules. David, you must never change because of the system and I have news
for you: You are NEVER gonna win the Oscar, not because you don&acute;t diserve it
but because your not in the Spielberg-Coppola-Scorsese gruop, you are in the
Kubrick-Hitchkock-Lynch gruop. Your movies are gonna be studied be every
person who wants to be a filmaker just like now people study
2001.
David, keep it on, never change.
