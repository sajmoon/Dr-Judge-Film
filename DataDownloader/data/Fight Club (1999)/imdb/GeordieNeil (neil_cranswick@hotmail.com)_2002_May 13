i first watched this film a week ago, and since then bought it and made my
girlfriend watch it with me.
the opening sequence as the camera travels thru a human body while zooming
out is breathtaking. it sets the motif of the film which is looking inside
of oneself. the settings really lend themselves to Jack's life and the
twisted philosophy that man can only achieve happiness thru self
destruction
is almost believable. the film has great performances from Norton, Pitt,
Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf's tits, and reaches a shocking conclusion
(which
is why it needs a second watching).
my girlfriend didn't really like it, complaining it had no real plot (which
it doesn't especially) and the only good thing is the ending. i feel this
is
wrong, but the ending is what we end up judging all films by,
ultimately.<br /><br />
