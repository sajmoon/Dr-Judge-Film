1999_December 8 

I had not expected to enjoy this film, as I thought it was a young males
film, so I am interested to see it is actually slightly more popular among
women.
In fact I enjoyed it tremendously.  Edward Norton has always been a superb
actor who is insufficiently well-known or respected.  In choosing his films
Brad Pitt tries very hard to make himself ugly, but he just can't succeed. 
But in this film he finally shows what I have long suspected - he is a
terrific actor.  Meatloaf is also a revelation - I did not recognize him,
and he can act too.
Tip when you are watching the film - keep an eye on the backgrounds as
things are sometimes happening which it would be a pity to miss.  On one
occasion they pass a cinema showing &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, one of Brad's
turkeys, but the letters are falling off the sign.  Who says Americans take
themselves too seriously?
