Fight Club is amazing, brilliant, shocking, original, provocative, and
entertaining.  I loved it!  I've said it before, David Fincher is a
GENIUS...plain and simple.  Enough said.  The script of this movie is
brilliant, his direction is incredible, the acting is amazing, Brad Pitt is
incredible, as is Ed Norton of course.  So is Helena Bonham Carter, the only
other film I have seen her in was &quot;room with a view&quot;, so yeah, there's a
slight difference!<br /><br />The layers of meaning to this movie are so deep, I saw it twice and it still
leaves me thinking hard about all the little things in it.  The way it is
filmed is pure eye candy, truely brilliant, typical Fincher actually.  The
music by the Dust Brothers is great also.  I won't say much about the story
because it's probably been described enough in the other reviews and I don't
want to say much to ruin it either.  It is simply an original and
fascinating piece of cinema.  One of the best films of the
year.<br /><br />10/10
