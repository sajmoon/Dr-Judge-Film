This movie is still my favorite movie. I have seen many great Movies, but
Fight Club has always bin even greater.<br /><br />When you add David Fincher (Director) + Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) + Edward
Norton (Narrator) + Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer) + Meat Loaf (Bob)
+
Chuck Palahniuk (Story) you get the Best Movie of the 20th
Century.<br /><br />For me the main issue of the movie is that money alone won't make you
happy,
neither will the things you own.
You should rather stay with your buddies and live your life instead of
wasting it all at work (Not that I'm against work, I just think it's bad
being a workaholic).
Or like Chuck Palahniuk said it in his follow-up novel Survivor, that if
no
one had seen it, any action would be pointless.
When you work 12 hours a day behind a desk, you don't accomplish anything
real,you're life was only about getting money, it was pointless.
