1999_November 3 
<br /><br />Every now and then there comes a movie that defines the feeling of its time
and generation, a movie with its puls on the generation of its times. They
are not always accepted by everyone, especially the critic. But after 10
years they become classics. I think Fight club is one of them. A satire on
our society and the meaningless consumerism that surrounds
us.<br /><br />The main character is a so anonymous and normal that we never get to know
his name. Edward Norton is credited as the narrator. He lives a life
consumed in material values. He cant seem to find a meaning in his life,
he's struggling to do exactly what everyone else want him to do, just going
with the flow, not questioning anything. How many of us have not felt this
way before. Tormented by insomnia (Doctor: no, you cant die of insomnia),
he
joins support group for testicular cancer. Where he experiences the
pleasure
of crying in another person's arms. He is now addicted. In his words he
explains his addiction: When people think your dying, they finally shut up
and listen to what you have to say. That's when Marla comes in an equally
fake support-addict who the narrator describes as : &quot;a little scratch on
the
roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it--but
you can't&quot;<br /><br />In the top of his depression the narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man with a
vision and a philosophy &quot;its only after we've lost everything that we we're
free to do anything&quot;.<br /><br />Wow am blown away<br /><br />This film is more intelligent than it actually looks
Ironical to the bone. Filmed with camera techniques that remind us of
commercials. This film deals with the masculine self-destruction or rage.
Its about a white-collar worker who creates a fighting club. Where males
can
come and beat the shit out of each other, as a way of letting out their
steam and confusion. The film tries to explore the dehumanization of our
culture. A hard thing to do without being provocative.<br /><br />Masterly made both technically and acting wise. Both Edward Norton and Brad
Pitt give exceptional performances<br /><br />Industrial noise music by Dust brothers, nicely edited and filmed, blending
computer generated effects with story. This is indeed filmmaking at its
finest. A testament that once in a while the Hollywood machinery can
actually produce a gem that could not have been possible any other way.<br /><br />a film constantly turning from reality to the absurd fantasy. The twists
and
turns keep you on the edge of your seat,. And did I mention that the film
has twist that will blow you away ? Keeping true to his tradition, David
Fincher cooks up a hell of an ending.<br /><br />A film no adult movie fan can dare to miss, and this is a film for adults,
mind you. This is an intelligent film, and David Fincher is a
master.<br /><br />Gems like this don't grow on trees.... go and see
