Fight Club truly was one of my favorite films of the 90's and maybe my
favorite film ever.  It's just one of those movies you have to see twice
to
get it.  This is a perfect example of movie with meaning.  And Pitt was
freakin awesome as Tyler Durden(my role model) and Edward Norton was
awesome
too.  The script was great and Fincher is just one of my favorites with
films such as Seven(awesome), The Game(awesome), &amp; Panic Room(Awesome).
Fight Club is about an office slave insomniac who is living in a world of
IKEA furniture catalogs and Starbucks.  And the only way, he found out, to
relieve his insomnia is to go to retreat groups for patients of terminal
diseases such as Testicular Cancer, Tuberculosis, Parasites, and more.
That's where he meets Marla Singer who is a chain smoking woman who like
Norton is faking his diseases to go to groups.  He is then interupted and
cannot go to sleep.  He then meets another person, Tyler Durden which h
meets on an airplane.  I'm not telling you the rest.  Count on me, this is
a
great film.  This is also an example of a College Poster Movie(a movie's
poster is on a college frat, dorm, etc.)  It's really bad
a**.<br /><br />9/10
