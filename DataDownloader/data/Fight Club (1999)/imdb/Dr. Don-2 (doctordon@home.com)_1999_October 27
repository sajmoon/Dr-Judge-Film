1999_October 27 

That is, I've already read reviews trashing it for its supposed support of
physical violence, anarchic bombings, and so on.<br /><br />However, this is actually a film -- in this case, a work of art in form of
a
film -- and not a manifesto!  Starting from the dramatic opening, followed
closely by some excellent dry humour (Ikeaworld), the film follows the
disintegration of the finely-wrought defenses of a man whose illusions and
reality are untenably in conflict.<br /><br />Edward Norton is brilliant as the narrator.  Picking up from his fine
performance in &quot;American History X&quot;, he is better still in this role, with
the gradual deconstruction of a highly-strung mind expressed with glimpses,
gestures, hesitations, mutterings and unpredictable outbursts.  Very
convincing, very sympathetic and also very scary.<br /><br />Brad Pitt, who I like to discount as an actor (for good reason, generally)
was a great and pleasant surprise in the role of alter ego.  Given the
chance to play, he shows a lot in this role and earns respect as an actor,
not a pretty face.<br /><br />The dark humour leavens the subject matter sufficiently to make it hard for
me to understand how critics such as in Entertainment Weakly (sic) rail at
the film for being in favour of violence and mayhem.  For goodness sake --
it's a portrayal of characters, not propaganda.  This film is no more a
proposal for violence than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; promotes
cannibalism.<br /><br />I saw this film on consecutive nights and was just as satisfied with its
editing, script, cinematography, direction and acting on the second night
as
on the first.  Rates a 9 out of 10 from me.<br /><br />So far this is turning out to be a fine year for American cinema.  &quot;Eyes
Wide Shut&quot; (a satire that most people mistook for a story about orgies),
&quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Fight Club&quot;, plus the
non-American film &quot;Besieged&quot; all are worthy of Oscar nominations for Best
Film and for Best Director, plus some acting nominations for
each.
