I love this movie. It's not for everyone though. Most people turn away after
just glancing the title, believing this to be some sort of 'Rocky' movie
which it most certainly is not. This is a subversive commentary about
modern-day problems.<br /><br />Consider the fact that SOME of the people on this planet are
less-than-satisfied with their 9-5 clockwatching office-cubicle nuclear
family type lives. Consider the fact that not everyone who appears to be
insane is insane or perhaps that the &quot;sane&quot; people are all out of their
minds. Consider the fact that although commercialism controls our minds
perhaps not everyone is all that thrilled with that. Or let me put it
another way... if you are the kind of person who finds they'd like to put a
brick through the window of your local Starbucks for some &quot;unknown&quot;
reason... well then, this is the movie for you!
If not, then please go hole up with a 'nice' Julia Roberts or Tommy Lee
Jones flick and leave the rest of us alone!<br /><br />This movie has the power to enlighten minds and shatter paradigms. The
editing is amazing. The special FX are phenomenal. The camerawork and color
is stunning and the scripting and dialog is great! (The book is equally
amazing and the film, for the most part, stays true to the original.) The
Dust Brothers also produced a simply amazing soundtrack for this
film.<br /><br />Not only that, this movie is darkly humorous...as well as extremely violent,
but, as i said this movie is NOT for everyone. If you don't get it... well
thats too bad.
I love it and the ending always makes me cry... hearing the Pixies (from
Massachusetts, like me) playing at the end just makes me weep tears of joy
that someone would make a movie like this for all of us corporate
slaves.<br /><br />Thank you, David Fincher!
