1999_November 15 

Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most original movies of 1999. Ed
Norton gives an oscar worthy performance and so does the supporting cast.
Not only was David Finch's directing one point, but the cinematography was
stunning.<br /><br />Much has been said about the violence, but personally I enjoyed it. I
thought Finch did a great job of showing how violence leads to more more
violence. What started as Fight Club escalated into Project Mayhem.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more about the movie because to do so would be
giving away then plot and this a mvie best watched raw.
