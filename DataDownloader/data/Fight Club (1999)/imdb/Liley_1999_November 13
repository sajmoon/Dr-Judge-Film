1999_November 13 

I had heard a little about the film before watching it and was rather
ambivalent about it. On walking out of the theater, I had no doubts that
this was the best movie I had seen all year, and possibly ever. Pitt plays
the extrovert/devil superbly and Norton is superb not only onscreen (he's
in
99% of the shots) but also with his voice over narration. The film is
violent - but that's what its about. It is also very funny and witty in
places. Many reviews complain that the last half of the film loses it a bit
and while the final scene is a bit much these actions are presented as the
logical conclusion for these men to attempt to reclaim what modern,
consumerist life has stripped them of<br /><br />The film is a must see. Not only is it thought provoking but also extremely
well made and entertaining
