2000_April 6 

It seems silly to take the time to write one more awed review of this movie
months and months after it's died a commercial death, but the more I think
about it the more appalled I am that there are so many people out there who
would love Fight Club as much as I do and who have no intention of seeing
it, ever. I want to hire a bus and ferry all my friends to and from
screenings so they don't miss out on the biggest cinematic experience of the
90s.<br /><br />All concerned give the best work of their careers to this movie and even
with its cargo of irreverence and disgust at our society, it has as much
intelligence and class as 1999's best: American Beauty, The Talented Mr.
Ripley, Election etc. David Fincher is a genius. Fight Club is 1999's Blade
Runner and in ten years time everyone will be claiming to have known it was
a masterpiece first time round. Go see it.
