2000_June 7 

I just watched Fight Club.  I had heard the mixed reviews, which mainly
said
that it was all about violence.  I did not realise it was a black comedy
about the hidden need for man to find value in his existence.  With
clever,
scathing dialogue and brilliantly subtle humour, Fight Club stands a
pivotal
crossroad between Edward Norton's riveting performance in American History
X
and Brad Pitt's gifted insanity in 12 Monkeys.  Nowhere until the very end
can there be any understanding of the script.  Somewhere around the
two-hour
mark, we pause as we did in The Sixth Sense and let our minds journey back
throughout the brutal ecstasy of the events that led us blindly up this
garden path of destruction.  Admittedly, this is not a film for everyone.
A
strong stomach is required for the bare-fisted scenes, which spew blood
and
guts mercilessly into our bags of popcorn, drenched in the urine someone
had
the audacity to  label butter.  Helen Bonham-Carter plays primal modern
man's conception of residual modern woman, with f**k me written all over
her
in every scene she plays; f**k me, like the cancer-ridden woman at one of
the support groups the needful Norton attends at the start of the film,
whose one last hope in life before her body lays her waste is to get laid
by
some, by any, man.  This is a film about man versus man versus the machine
versus God versus himself.  Brad Pitt plays a travelling soap salesman.
But
nothing short of amnesia will be able to wash away the effect of this soon
to be rated classic.  And this, my friends, a film with no Oscar
nominations, is why I do not watch The Awards.
