I'll start by saying this isnt the best movie ever, which some people
think,
but it is very good. I hated Brad Pitt before this movie, but now I just
think of him as Tyler Durden and he is awesome, and of course Ed Norton,
one
of the best actors currently in film. You learn alot about what you can do
with soap and other interesting facts and at the same time learn about
people. I think this movie has an awesome storyline that can be
appreciated
by anyone, and the deep thinker can ponder things in this film too.
