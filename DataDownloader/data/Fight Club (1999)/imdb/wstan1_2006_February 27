After reading numerous comments I feel it's safe to say that this film
has gained somewhat conflicting responses from its viewers. I honestly
loved this film, the story is incredible, and the execution from novel
to motion picture is brilliant.<br /><br />The majority of the &quot;Hated it&quot; comments (that I read) were somewhat
contradictory. It seemed that the people who disliked it did so because
they saw a standpoint on western society that they did not like, they
saw something that they disagreed with and were discomforted by it.
However, I feel that this is what Fight Club is all about. This film
shows the discrepancies between those who question purpose and those
who don't. This movie affected me because it made me see something in
myself and the people around me, something that I did not necessarily
like. Not many films have the ability to that that to a person, and I
feel that's what makes Fight Club so excellent.<br /><br />I can see how this film could be considered depressing or twisted by
some viewers but I feel it's anything but.<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk uses Fight Club as a vehicle to express his own
thoughts and to depict the spiritual struggle of the modern man.
Ironically this film provides relief for those feeling mediocre, or
slaves to the &quot;IKEA nesting instinct&quot; through the catastrophic outcome
of the fight club mentality. This film provokes thought by showing that
the seditious behaviour of middle-aged men searching for meaning solves
nothing but their own psychological battles.<br /><br />Casting, screenplay, cinematography and story, all excellent in my own
opinion.<br /><br />10 Out of 10.
