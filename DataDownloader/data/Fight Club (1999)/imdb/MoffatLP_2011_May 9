Okay, all I can say about Fight Club is that it is absolutely
spectacular. This is everything you can ask for in a movie. Bits of
comedy, great plot, perfect characters, perfect acting, and an ending
that will blow your mind. All is perfect in this film. There are many
great quotes and dialogue that will always be remembered. Without the
spectacular dialogue and quotes, this movie wouldn&#x27;t be as great. The
movie starts at a decent pace so you&#x27;re not waiting too long for
anything to happen. The way the film was shot was great, to start with
the ending, restart from the beginning, then work your way to the
&#x27;final&#x27; ending. David Fincher has yet again put together an absolute
masterpiece, making it better than the book, which is amazing to start
with. It is another one of those movies that you can watch over and
over and not get bored of it. If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie, read the
book, or don&#x27;t own it, do yourself a favour and go out and buy it...
now. If you don&#x27;t pick up Fight Club, you have no idea what you&#x27;re
missing out on, buy it as soon as possible. And remember, the first
rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
