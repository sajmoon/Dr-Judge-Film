I saw this movie last night at our local fleapit, going in to the cinema I
didn't really know what to expect; when leaving I don't think I was much
the
wiser.
That's not to say though that Fight Club, for me, wasn't the film of the
90's - it was. I certainly don't want to spoil the movie for those who
haven't seen it, suffice to say that it's a tale of a bored office worker
who slightly goes &quot;off the rails&quot; The films violence, for some, will be
quite disturbing - I thought I was unshockable before I saw it - this
aggression however, becomes secondary to the tangled sub-plots and superb,
strong character acting. If you are not too weak of heart, and can
appreciate a great movie, please go and see Fight Club, and be
amazed.
