1999_November 26 

My first, gut reaction after wading through the blood and bandages of
Fight
Club came to me outside the theatre when I could breathe once again:
Censor
it.  Ban it.  Burn it.<br /><br />Once again American Directors (we certainly can not blame Hollywood for
everything) with a penchant for amalgamating an underlying homoerotic
theme
with baseless, suicidal violence has produced another offshoot of
cinematic
corruption:  Fight Club.  Director David Fincher could neither marry a
well
balanced theme with a sturdy script about an unbalanced male (Edward
Norton)
and our sexual diablo/dream merchant-of-destruction (Brad Pitt) without
giving us a Killing Field of violence so horrid, so graphic and so
unbelievable that you wince every time a fist is raised in anger.  Fincher
has a good idea in the beginning of the film with Norton's lust for
self-worth in the ubiquitous 12-step program. This could have been
developed. Should have been developed.<br /><br />Instead, we are thrust into a sweaty parade of brain-dead muscled toughs
who
lack self actualization (and common sense) to beat hell out of each other.
Written into the &quot;theme&quot; was an unbuttoned commando-style military
operation
against a reich of credit card companies who must be made to pay, say the
director (after all the actors must adhere to what the film fuhrers
dictate)
or else Brad Pitt and troop would be unable to watch an American Express
commerical without going postal.  The rightousness of the operation was,
&quot;the end justifies the means&quot; and the director has then established the
justification for unwarranted violence against the city controllers -- all
of whom &quot;will pay.&quot;<br /><br />In the best traditions of Oliver Stone's disturbing Natural Born Killers,
Fight Club gives us nothing new, nothing effervescent, nothing
challenging.
We are fed the usual trinity of violence, sex, and dream-like innuendo in
a
movie, so devoid of theme and story that we are unable to comprehend
exactly whats coming next.  We can neither enter into the movie or tag
along with it.  We certainly can't weep or feel sorry for anyone -- and
with
the absence of a &quot;hero&quot; -- there is nothing left to do but grip the sides
of
your seat and grind your teeth as lawlessness reigns supreme in the land.
Didn't they draw and quarter the Greek playwrights in Athens for
presenting
productions like this?<br /><br />Fight Club is a movie we do not need in our day and age.  If teen
violence,
coupled with the troubled state of affairs of an even younger generation
are
being blamed for thematic approaches in film-making, the American viewing
public must vote with its dollar to reject it.  Fight Club glamorizes
violence (where NBK glamorized murder) and feeds nothing to our psyche
except....more.  More mind-numbing fist-to-cuffs where people are beaten
so
graphically on screen, we no longer wince, but accept it as part of
life.<br /><br />The mental state of the directors and screen writers who produce such
material must be suspect.  However, we can't condemn them for trash,
although, certainly some directors will rebound with flair and produce
creations that win awards.<br /><br />Fight Club deserves nothing but our anger, revulsion and pity.  What else
could such a blood bath exhibit from us?  If we are supposed to emote
during
film, are we supposed to be enthralled at a holocaust of exhibition that
our
mental judgement rejects it whole heartedly?  If so, then the viewers
opinion is then suspect.  Do our viewers beleive that Fight Club is truly
a
film about two men who beat hell out of each other and then join forces to
fight the system?  If this is certainly true, then David Fincher and other
directors have not pushed the envelope further.  If Fight Club is not the
end of such films, dear viewer, be ready for upcoming visual
demonstrations
of child molestation, rape of women, extermination of the marginalized (at
least those the directors find reproachable and therefore game) because
you
have certainly seen nothing yet.<br /><br />
