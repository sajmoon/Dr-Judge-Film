Fight Club is like no other movie out there. The brilliance of
everything in this movie is just amazing. Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham
Carter and Edward Norton give outstanding performances. But what makes
this movie so perfect is the idea and plot. To start off id like to say
that i think this is Brad Pitt&#x27;s best performance to date. He becomes
the character in such a deep level that it makes him more believable
that even in &#x22;twelve Monkeys&#x22;. This Movie focuses on how we, consumers,
live our lives in this corrupt world. The narrator(Norton) is troubled
by his insomnia and finds a way to deal with it by lying to get into
support groups and being around other people that suffer as he thinks
he is suffering. After it is ruined by Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) he
mets Tyler Durden (Pitt) and creates &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;, which makes his life
the best its ever been. The various messages the movie gives you are so
well thought of and shocking that it makes this movie a must-see for
everyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some more than mild violence. Finally, the
ending. The ending for Fight club is probably the best movie ending
ever. It blows away any movie ending you have ever seen. This movie
should&#x27;ve won Best Picture for 1999. Trust me, everyone should watch
this extraordinary movie. It just goes above and beyond any
expectations you can give it.<br /><br />Also: &#x22;Where is my mind&#x22; is best song choice possible for the movie
