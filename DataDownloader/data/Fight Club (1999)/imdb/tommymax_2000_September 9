perhaps i am -- by fanoogle's standards.  though i wouldn't call &quot;fight
club&quot; trash, it came pretty close.<br /><br />simply put, this film is a waste of time.  apparently the gen-x'rs
appreciated it, or at least some of them.  perhaps one needs to truly
understand multiple body piercings to appreciate this film.  not that
there's anything wrong with multiple body piercings -- it's still a free
country.<br /><br />but i suspect that like this film, such behavior expresses a certain
hopelessness that is probably necessary to truly appreciate &quot;fight club.&quot;
my generation was pretty counter culture, too.  but whereas i thought we
were trying to make the world a better place in which to live, many of the
kids today seem to simply be rejecting life itself.<br /><br />they will undoubtedly enjoy this pointless film.<br /><br />which is to say that anyone with a simple appreciation of good filmmaking
need not bother with this one.<br /><br />i found it moronic, pointless, and mindnumbingly LONGGGG.<br /><br />i've read all the reviews of this film at this site to date, and i'm quite
surprised no one has mentioned how long it was.<br /><br />it was excruciatingly long.  139 minutes seemed like forever, especially
the
2nd half.<br /><br />all three main characters turned in good performances, though pitt's wasn't
nearly as compelling as his early grayce in &quot;kalifornia&quot; in an almost
identical role (a bit more sophisticated here, but just as depraved
nonetheless).<br /><br />it's just that the story was so bad.  i wonder what these three stars
really
think of this film.  perhaps they took the project because they thought
they
were making a truly meaningful movie.<br /><br />they were wrong.<br /><br />if this film had a message, it could have made it just as convincingly in
45
minutes and saved us the agony.<br /><br />i generally don't give a number rating, but if i were to do so here i
couldn't give this more than 3 out of 10.  and that would only be for the
acting.  put 3 mediocre actors in this film and it wouldn't score a
1.<br /><br />essentially a waste of time waiting (and hoping) for something meaningful
to
happen.<br /><br />it never does.<br /><br />if you still have a brain and haven't completely given up on life in
america, or someplace else in the world for that matter, do yourself a
favor
and skip this one.<br /><br />or rent it and watch it just to see for yourself.  it's still a free
country.<br /><br />but if you want to see truly good films AND good performances by pitt and
norton in somewhat similar roles, rent &quot;kalifornia&quot; and &quot;american history
x&quot;
instead.<br /><br />
