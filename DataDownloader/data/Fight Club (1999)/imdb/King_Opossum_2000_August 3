The first thing I saw when I came to IMDB's entry for FIGHT CLUB was the
words &quot;Don't come much better than this&quot;. This simple statement sums up this
amazing, breakthrough movie.<br /><br />The sheer size of imagination required to create a film like this beggars
belief. This truly is a movie like no other, and although shocking in
content, is strangely alluring in its ways. David Fincher deserves an Oscar
for his immaculate direction, and the performances of leads Norton, Pitt and
Bonham-Carter are flawless. Much like THE SIXTH SENSE, the movie benefits
greatly from a second viewing (you will be surprised!), and a third, a
fourth, etc etc.<br /><br />You get the idea - stop reading this drivel - WATCH IT!!!!!!!
