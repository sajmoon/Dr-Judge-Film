1999_December 16 

I entered the cinema with a certain degree of scepticism with regards fight
club - I'm no great fan of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton hardly struck me as a
proven great, and the inclusion of Meat Loaf had me worried. Still, my
friends and I had decided to go and see the film anyway, as it had received
such startling reviews.<br /><br />We entered the cinema expecting merely a violent flick about people beating
each other to a pulp, but what we were actually greeted with was a
cinematic
masterpiece, darkly satirical, whilst playing on the manic side of each and
every person in the cinema. The plot is perfectly woven, Edward Norton is
worthy of an oscar, Brad Pitt is back to Legends of the Fall form, the
special effects add perfectly to the feel of the film, and you seem to
leave
the cinema safe in the knowledge that you've seen one of the few true
cinematic masterpieces of the late 90's.<br /><br />I personally, was completely blown away by the Fight Club experience, and,
having only seen the film twice, it firmly ranks as one of my all-time
favourites. In short - Fight Club was by far the best film of 1999 (and
that
includes the Matrix) and one of the best of the decade
itself.
