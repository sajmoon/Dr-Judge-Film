This movie is extremely hard to define and is certainly not a movie to be
seen only once.  When I first saw it, I would classify it as a simple
action/suspense/thriller movie, fairly entertaining but nothing special.
The difference between this reaction and the reaction I got from seeing it
a
second time is astronomical.<br /><br />Edward Norton does an excellent job playing the unnamed narrator, a man
who
has a steady job, a nice apartment, a stable life...and is beginning to
realize that it is all meaningless, that he is a by-product of the
corporate
society, that he is not really living at all.  Enter Tyler Durden, an
independent rebel who identifies immediately with the narrator and by his
nonconformist lifestyle that things do not have to be this way, that he
can
reject the cookie-cutter &quot;perfect life&quot; and instead make his life mean
something--to stop living as society would have him live and not care
about
the reactions he gets.<br /><br />I've been told that this is a &quot;guy&quot; movie, but a look at the breakdown of
user ratings here will tell you otherwise.  Despite the bare-knuckle
boxing
and action, this is not a &quot;guy&quot; movie, nor is action its focus.  This
movie
is about rebellion against a stagnant society, against living a life
without
purpose.  Tyler Durden carries these ideas to the extreme, and the results
are clear.  However, I submit that this movie suggests that the opposite
extreme is equally bad, if not worse.
