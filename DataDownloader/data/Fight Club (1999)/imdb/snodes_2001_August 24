OK so it's a schizo film, it's a black comedy, it's about terrorists, it's
a
Brad Pitt film, it's about changing your life, oh yeah - and also about
fighting. Whatever your preconceptions about Fight Club, they'll be
confounded. The ever-watchable Norton is the star of the show here with
Pitt
drafted in to play &quot;Brad Pitt&quot; (again). OK, so the &quot;big picture&quot; of FC is
let down by it's narrative in parts but it has to be applauded for sheer
invention and some real attention to detail. Some of the sentiments are a
bit 2D and about 10 years out of date (substitute Pitt and Norton for
Swayze
and Reeves and you know where we are) but FC carries this because of the
humour. Great film, if just for the fact that it puts the final nail in the
(flat-packed) coffin of the 90's by satirising IKEA.
