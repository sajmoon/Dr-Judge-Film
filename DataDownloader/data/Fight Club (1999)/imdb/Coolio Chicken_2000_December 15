     FIGHT CLUB IS THE GREATEST FILM OF 1999!
     But wait, let me start at the beginning.
     Contrary to popular belief, FIGHT CLUB is not a &quot;depraved film about a
bunch of guys who beat each other up, which will turn all men into Space
Monkeys.&quot; It is the deepest, most intelligent and stylish film for
ages.<br /><br />     We start in the Narrator's (Edward Norton) brain and we stay there for
the rest of the film. We go out of his brain, through his nostril's and down
the barrel of a gun in a beginning sequence to rival Se7en's. Then we see
that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is holding the gun. Then we swoop down the
building and into a van, where there are explosives which are going to be
used to destroy all the major credit card company's buildings. &quot;I know
this,&quot; tells the Narrator, &quot;because Tyler knows this.&quot; You won't know what
any of this means until the final credits.<br /><br />    We go back a little, to the days of the Narrator's insomnia, which is
only cured by going to cancer support groups. Everything is fine for the
Narrator until a woman named Marla Singer (Helen Bonham Carter) starts
'visiting' the support groups too. They work out squedules and Narrator can
sleep again. Then he meets Tyler Durden on a plane and it all hits the
fan.<br /><br />   They start up a Fight Club for all of those who are like the Narrator,
which soon leads to terrorist attacks on consumerism. Oh yeah, there's also
a killer twist thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />   What makes Fight Club the best film for ages is that the script itself is
superb, and the direction by David Fincher is his most darkest and stylish
yet. The lighting is lowkey, there is some Matrixy camerawork, there are
subliminal messages (which are pointed out on the DVD commentry) and Fincher
sometimes wobbles the fabric of the film itself.<br /><br />   All in all, a first class package, superb performances, direction, oh,
and let's not forget the perfect music from the Dust Brothers.
A first class film, and a wake-up call for the Generation
Xers.
&quot;You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, you are the same decaying
organic matter as everything else! We are all members of the same compost
heap!&quot;
