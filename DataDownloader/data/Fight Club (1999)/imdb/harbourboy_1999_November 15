Fight Club is a movie of several parts.  Most of these parts are powerful
and thought provoking.  The performances by Pitt, Norton, and Bonham
Carter
are strong.  What lets the film down is the last 10 minutes where it seems
to drift away from its original course and get lost.  But I don't want to
dwell on that.  For the most part, it is compelling viewing, with one or
two
clever twists and turns.<br /><br />Good stuff.  77/100.
