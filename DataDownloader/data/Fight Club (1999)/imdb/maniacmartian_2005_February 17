i saw this film about 3 years ago and it still manages to amaze me.
every time i watch i notice something new. the acting, the story, the
way its shot are all superb. many people will just think this is about
violence and dismiss it without watching it. but this is a big mistake
as it is nothing like that but perfect in every way. even before it
started i knew i was in for something special the opening credits are
stylish and the backing music is great. and it just keeps getting
better right up to the final scene. this is the only film that has ever
left me speechless- and I've seen some great films, but this was
something else. and as for the end, i wont tell you what happens but
its pure brilliance. try watching it again and you'll notice a lot of
new things. watch this right now and i can tell you honestly you'll be
amazed as i was.
