Fight Club is one of the most memorable movies period. This movie was
beautifully filmed, written and acted. It gives us insight to the
miserable &quot;robotic&quot; lifestyle the western world has become accustomed
to. <br /><br />Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) is simply the vision and desire imposed on
society by media and what not, which leads to the vain attempts at self
improvement and constant unhappiness with oneself. <br /><br />The events in recent history are a testament to what Fight Club
proclaims. The constant striving for power and &quot;stuff&quot; that will
improve our lifestyles at the expense of others. In this case nations
against nations. Certain people can be see as the Tyler Durden and its
victims as Ikea. <br /><br />All in all this film has a greater commentary on modern society than
that which was spoken of. Those who dislike this movie simply see what
is given to them by the movie, but one of Fight Club's messages is to
expand your mind from what is laid infront of you. <br /><br />Watch it a few times. With an open mind and a mind which can see past
the story and apply it to greater things.
