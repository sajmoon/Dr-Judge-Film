Why is Fight Club so good?<br /><br />Brad Pitt (Seven) plays a character wilder than in 12
monkeys<br /><br />Edward Norton (American History X) plays an individual more intense than
his
role in Primal Fear<br /><br />Director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) Makes a movie even more
Mind-screwful than past features.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie to everyone, but if you would consider seeing
a movie called fight club that you know will screw with your mind, shock
you, and show much violence, Then do so The movie has a lot to offer, And
it
is very well done!
