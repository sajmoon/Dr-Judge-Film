The first time is the best time.  Yes, Fight Club is definitely a
cinematic
treat the first time out but it never quite leaves the back of your mind
and
keeps you coming back for more.  A great witty satire of capitalist
consumerism in modern society delivered by the repressed and liberated
personalities of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.<br /><br />Based on the Chuck Palahniuk novel.  A real rarity in adaptation, the film
being at least it's equal, if not better!<br /><br />Don't pass this great film by.
