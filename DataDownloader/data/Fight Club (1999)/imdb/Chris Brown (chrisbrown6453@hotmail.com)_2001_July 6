Jack (Edward Norton) is looking for a cure. He suffers from insomnia, from
an overdose of Starbucks and IKEA, and from overall apathy. Desensitized by
a super-structured life, Jack seeks change by joining a series of support
groups for victims of alcohol or cancer, and surrenders himself to the
notion of physical pain, emotional release and consolation. His newfound
peace, however, is disrupted when the eccentric Marla (Helena Bonham
Carter)
enters the groups but remains detached; a distraction which threatens to
break Jack's secure sense of belonging. Jack's identity crisis is
intensified by the introduction of Tyler (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and
leader of the &quot;Fight Club&quot;, the most violent support group he is tempted to
join.<br /><br />A film about the urge to &quot;reorganize the world&quot; through violence, Fight
Club
recalls the young &quot;droogs&quot; in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, yet it
exchanges the previous film's theatrics for an internalized --or rather,
visceral-- aesthetic. Fight Club benefits from a versatile camera, whose
extreme close-ups, extreme long shots, worm's-eye view shots, bird's-eye
view shots, freeze frames, slow motion and special effects explore the
destabilization and the de-structuring of the protagonist's
reality.<br /><br />Fight Club includes one of the greatest, if not the greatest (The Sixth
Sense?), twists in cinema history.  It is for that reason, that I suggest
Fight Club be remembered as a truly great piece of cinematography.<br /><br />
