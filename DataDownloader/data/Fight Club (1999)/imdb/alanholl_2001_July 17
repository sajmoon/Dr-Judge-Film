This has already been said, but I just wanted to say myself: this is not a
film about a fight club!<br /><br />The first time I saw it I was nothing short of lost. Only after I saw it a
second time did it begin to come together, and I think a lot of people
will
need to see it at least twice.  The brains behind this film are of pure
genious, that's all I need to say. As I see it, this film operates on a
few
different levels. And even if you take out all the depth out of it, it's
an
excellent story initself. I'm thinking faster than I can type - that's
what
this film does to you.
