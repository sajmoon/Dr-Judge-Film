1999_December 13 

This movie had me flippin' out thruout the whole thing. When you  get to
the
movie climax I was totally caught offguard. I thought the Matrix had a
great
climax, but then I saw Fight Club, and wow! Great movie. David Fincher is a
God among Directors. Se7en was a masterpiece and Fight Club only upped the
anti. I am now Reading the book and Fincher did a great job adapting to
Movie form. What else can I say.......Great.
