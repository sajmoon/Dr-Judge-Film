This was a risky undertaking for the filmmakers. Risky in that,
although the title or subject matter conjures up intrigue, it still is
an unpleasant way of life, if you think about it.<br /><br />However, Writers :Chuck Palahniuk and Jim Uhls have really given us
some insight into this world. Whether we like this or not it is real in
some areas, with some people. I wondered whether or not the writes
actually experienced this also. <br /><br />Director David Fincher takes it to the next level with an accomplished
handle on the material. He gets pretty good performances out of his
actors.<br /><br />Actors, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter lead the cast
which includes Meat Loaf, Zach Grenier, Richmond Arquette and David
Andrews. They all perform nicely and are believable.<br /><br />I found that the movie was well paced and never got bogged down in too
much dialog. It was also shot nicely.
