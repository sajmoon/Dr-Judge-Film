The movie starts out great. And it continues to be good. Okay,
critizising modern life and civilization may not have been too new
anymore when this movie came out (&quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;The Beach&quot; had
done that in a similar fashion before) but it was very well done. The
cast acted nicely (Brad Pitt's acting is a little like in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;)
and the direction was decent so i thought this was going to be a really
good movie. But I should have known not to judge a movie until I see
its end. &quot;Fight Club&quot; has an absolute idiotic ending!<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />The first thing is, Schizophrenia just doesn't work like this, okay?
It's not like you talk to yourself as if you were standing in front of
someone else. Besides, I wonder why Edward Norton took that role after
he had already played a similar part in &quot;Twilight&quot;.<br /><br />Secondly, how can Norten still be alive after he shot himself in the
head??? How is that possible??<br /><br />Too bad, this could have been so much better! 6/10
