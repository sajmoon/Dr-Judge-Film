Fight club is one of those films that will always manage to divide
opinion, you either love it or you hate it but no matter what your
opinion it is still a great film. Well acted, directed, scripted and
edited it is a film that knows it's a film and is willing to play
around. It is bold, hard-hitting, violent, funny, intelligent, and
stylish. I loved it, and still regard it as one of the best of all
time. The plot fast paced, interesting and has one of the greatest
twists in cinema history. It draws you in right at the beginning and
doesn't let go for a long time, there's not a boring moment in the
entire film. Sure it's not for everyone, but still everyone should see
it and have an opinion on it. The 90's brought many great films, and
this is one of the best.<br /><br />10 out of 10
