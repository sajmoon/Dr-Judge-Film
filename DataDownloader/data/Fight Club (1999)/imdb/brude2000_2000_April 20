I haven't read the book, but I have seen Fincher's latest masterpiece and,
rather than bore anyone with a synopsis of this mind-blowing gem, I must
state emphatically, &quot;This is one of the best movies made in the last 10
years!&quot;<br /><br />If I was stuck on a desert island, this classic would be at the top of my
list.  Bravo, Mr.Fincher!
