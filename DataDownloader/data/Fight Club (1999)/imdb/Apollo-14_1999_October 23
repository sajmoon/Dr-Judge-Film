I've never had a movie experience like this before.  Creepy, dark, brutal,
funny and ultimately dangerous and subversive.  This movie is a complete and
total affront to the Western capitalist system we live in.  Many feminists I
know have argued that it is a disgusting &quot;dick flick&quot;, a testosterone
overdose, but most viewers will see much more to this movie.  Pay extra
attention!  There are subliminal messages in the first act that flash for a
split second.  Keep your eyes peeled.
