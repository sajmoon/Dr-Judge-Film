2003_November 9 

Let's look at the facts, ok?<br /><br />1) David Fincher is the best new director of our times, second all time
only
to Mr. Kubrick<br /><br />2) Ed Norton is the best actor of our times, in one of his greatest roles
(sorry, but his greatest is in the film Primal Fear - he is
terrifying)<br /><br />3) Brad Pitt gives a performance that will blow you away<br /><br />4) Chuck Palahniuk is the freshest, most interesting new writer, and is at
top form with his first novel<br /><br />5) Jim Uhls, the screenwriter, is so exciting, so perfect that it is
nearly
inappropriate<br /><br />6) Even Jared Leto turns in a performance that while seemingly
unimportant,
isn't, and couldn't be better<br /><br />7) This film is absolulely perfect, with no flaws, and David Fincher is
quickly getting a reputation as a filmaker with an attention to detail and
perfectionist attitude on par with our Mr. Kubrick<br /><br />8) I have seen this film now at least 40 times, i never get tired of it,
and
i rank it as the greatest film i have ever seen.<br /><br />9) This film changed my life, because, before Fight Club, i never knew
that
one could make films this perfect, and now, i can never go
back
