The song that goes along with the titles at the end of the film; where's
my
mind is from the band the pixies ( as some of you might know). Another
song
from The Pixies is 'monkey gone to heaven'. Jack (Norton) and Tyler Durden
(Pitt) are talking a few times about spacemonkeys. The term covers the
idea
of the film actually completely. That is: without struggling go sit in a
spacecraft and be shot to space.(metaphor for life in modern society
ofcourse).<br /><br />Any reactions?
