2000_July 4 

The movie is about someone getting too big for their britches. It's about
revolution getting out of hand. Some say the first half of the movie is
good
and the second half falls flat. The move is the first half presenting good
ideas, and great theories but then it shows how dumb people are how they
mess it up. And if you think I'm stupid and misinterperted it, listen to
the
commentary on the DVD by the people who made the film. It's not my
original
thought, I'm too much of a hack to do that. The film is about a man going
insane!
