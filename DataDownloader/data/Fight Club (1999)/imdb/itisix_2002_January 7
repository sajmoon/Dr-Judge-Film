This must be one of the most insane movies I have ever seen. It's
brilliant.
A perfect picture of the society and of the way people are &quot;guided&quot; by it.
Someone breaks the barrier and engages in revolution.<br /><br />The script is suberb and the cast is even better. The fast moving cameras
and the &quot;weird&quot; angles add up to it.<br /><br />2 of the greates actors of the present time and a huge support cast. All
of
this makes a perfect movie.<br /><br />It reminds me of 12 monkeys in a way, and Brad Pitt is on top of his game
in
this movie (arguable with Se7en)
Edward Norton also makes the role of his life (although I really like
American History X).<br /><br />The movie for generation X... is it?
