A friend recommended Fight Club to me a few years back, so naturally I
checked out the reviews. How could it be that a film with such a fine
crew of actors and producers etc., create such a so-called &#x22;childish,
attention-seeking rant&#x22;? I was instantly intrigued. After purchasing it
soon after, I can honestly say never has a film, or for that matter,
any form of entertainment touched me the way Fight Club did and indeed
had. WIthin just over 36 hours of owning it, I&#x27;d watched it three
times. Yes, its that good! It has a unique cold feel to it from the
start, something no film I&#x27;ve seen since has been able to match. THe
longer I watched it, the sterner my face became, the more I &#x22;wanted to
destroy something beautiful&#x22;. Fight Club rejects the emotional, social
and indeed financial &#x27;comfort&#x27; of the condo life, provoking within you
a desire to get out and make something of your life. Harrowingly
comedic at times, Palahniuk&#x27;s (author of the novel) idea not to display
the name of the lead character (referred to as Jack in the film), gives
the viewer the unique experience to almost adopt the character of Jack,
which in itself is some achievement. This is a film that is
preach-worthy, genuinely incredible, filled with a feel-bad after
effect that begs you to get angry at the societal structure you happen
to adore. Its not, as the title would suggest, just about a group of
weak men starting up a &#x27;Fight Club&#x27;, its so much more, and is essential
to every house around. Also advised to get your hands on the novel, by
Chuck Palahniuk.
