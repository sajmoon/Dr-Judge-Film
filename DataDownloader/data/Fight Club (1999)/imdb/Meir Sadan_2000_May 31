<br /><br />This movie fascinated me, both technically and emotionally. It brewed up a
few ideas I've been having myself this past period, and I find it to be an
excellent visualization of the &quot;mutanity&quot; and sickness these days
endorse.<br /><br />The violence completely shocked my parents, who also hated Seven for the
same reason. Fincher has a passion for irregular film-noir. That's one of
the things I liked about it.<br /><br />All in all, a must-see for young audience.
