Magnificent. Bold. Thought-provoking. You either fall in love with a film
like this or you hate it. Needless to say I loved it. Just five minutes of
FIGHT CLUB -any five minutes- has more heart, soul and invention than any
Hollywood blockbuster we will see this summer. The most remarkable thing
about this film though is that it got made at all, and by a Hollywood studio
at that. The mind boggles that a studio system so dominated by popcorn
'event' movies that are so consistently mindless could also produce a film
so witty, non-pc and intelligent. Viewers may not agree with what the film
says, but it certainly demands attention. Fincher is some kind of genius.
