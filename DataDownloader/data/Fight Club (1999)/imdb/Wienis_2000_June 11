When Fight Club first came out, I really didn't want to see it.  My friend
tried to persuade me, but I thought it would just be a movie with Brad
Pitt
walking around without a shirt for 2 hours, and guys beating the hell out
of
each other.  However, I just finished watching (the same friend finally
convinced me) and it was MAD AWESOME!!!  I managed to mix awesome blood
and
violence while successfully satirizing pop culture and modern masculinity.
I could tell that it was going to be cool when I first saw Brad Pitt flash
in for a frame three times in the opening scenes (my friend didn't see it,
but he did see the giant wiener at the end, go figure).  Basically, do
yourself a favor and watch this movie, you'll like it.
