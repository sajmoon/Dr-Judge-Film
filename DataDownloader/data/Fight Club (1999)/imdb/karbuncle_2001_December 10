Fight Club is a movie capable of being viewed on multiple levels, one of
these is it's post-modernity vs. modernity stance. Thinking that the
miracles of technology and working for the greater good so in 50 years
we'll
have robots to walk our dogs and flying jetson cars has already been
proven
to have failed. we're not solving our problems through science. we're not
as
individuals happy for the work we do. post modernity is what's taken it's
place. stick with more natural things, believing in instinct for once
instead of what society has programmed into your brain as to what's right
and what's wrong. men can be men. one line in fight club is ' we're a
generation of men raised by women. i'm starting to wonder if another woman
is really the answer we're looking for.' in a time when everybody's hands
seem tied in one way or another, it's exciting to see a movie where the
characters decide no more. they take it to the nialistic and anarchist
extremes, and it's very fun to watch. more than once of course, because
everytime you watch it you see something new. and the ending in my opinion
was the biggest surprise of it's year, not Sixth Sense. watch it, own it,
love it. it's Fight Club. 'nuff said.
