2003_January 2 

I first saw Fight Club about two years ago.  Of course, I loved it.  I own
the soapbox DVD.  So when the time came for me to choose some reading
material last summer, I picked the book to read and see how it compared.
I
actually liked the movie better than the book.  I think it is better than
the book, something that does not happen often (see Jurassic Park, both
versions of Red Dragon, many Stephen King translations to film,
etc.)<br /><br />The book is definitely unique.  It is told like the poems the Narrator
reads
about Jack's organs.  It is a lot of first person dialogue from a guy you
are sure is a wimp.  I think the movie improves on it by the gimmicks like
the changeovers and frames inserted.  Moreover, I feel the ending to the
book was rather lacking and disapointing (maybe because of the great
ending
to the movie).  Most importantly, I think the movie emphasizes the actual
Fight Club/Project Mayhem aspect better.  It is a major source of conflict
in the film, while more of a backdrop in the book.  The book is more of an
exploration of the relationship with Marla and the narrator's state of
mind.
It's also very short (if you try, you can read it in a day), while the
movie is over two hours long.  If you read the book, you'll see a lot of
the
dialogue is lifted from there, but I think some of the quotes from the
movie
are snappier (the &quot;I want to have your abortion&quot; line on the alternate
take
found on the DVD is from the book, but the line &quot;I haven't been f**ked
like
that since grade school&quot; is just hilarious.)  About the only scene I could
see from the book making the movie better/funnier is Tyler cooking Marla's
mom's collagen &quot;gift.&quot;<br /><br />The movie's very deep.  We, the audience, see characters in the same light
as the Narrator does as the movie progresses.  Though Tyler seems to be
the
perfect buddy and collaborator, we all soon find him to be just a psycho
and
the liberated space monkeys as lemmings.  The despised Marla (I am Jack's
raging bile duct) we all come to find endearing... somehow.
