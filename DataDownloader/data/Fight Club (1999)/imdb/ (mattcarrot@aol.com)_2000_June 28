The first 50 minutes of Fight Club, are wonderful...We see how Edward Norton
relates to this materialistic world...Then he meets Tyler, and then this
move spirals into the most offensive, stupid movies ever created. The FIGHT
CLUB scenes are often violent, and how come no one realizes that the'yre
fighting for no apparent reason? Then, we see how stupid this gen can
be...by the end of this trash, demonic movie, we see one of the stupidest
twists ever...However, the scene about Tyler working the reel thing at the
theater is hilarious....but overall, this movie sucks...2/10
