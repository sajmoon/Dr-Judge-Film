Fight Club. What can you say about Fight Club. It&#x27;s awesome? Not
enough. Brilliant? Not there yet. Should&#x27;ve won Academy Awards for Best
Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and
Adapted Screenplay? You&#x27;re on the right track. Stay with me and I will
run you through the whys.<br /><br />Why should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just
because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because
it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap
that came out of Tyler Durden&#x27;s and the Narrator&#x27;s mouths. But the
philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each
character&#x27;s state of mind.<br /><br />Why should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena
Bonham Carter was the only person who could&#x27;ve played Marla Singer. No
one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As
probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just
as well as the rest of the male cast.<br /><br />Why for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you
finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film?
Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the
spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times
before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick,
cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all
time.<br /><br />Best Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt&#x27;s performance with the key
component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as
the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn&#x27;t really give
a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant
performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.<br /><br />Best Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s twisted novel and twisted
it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this
movie wouldn&#x27;t be the same. It wouldn&#x27;t be the same cult classic that a
lot of people come to love and worship.<br /><br />If you put all of these element&#x27;s together, you get Best Picture. A
story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing
cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.<br /><br />There you have it. Also, kudos on the editing and the music.<br /><br />Fight Club ****out of****.<br /><br />Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Language and Sexuality.
