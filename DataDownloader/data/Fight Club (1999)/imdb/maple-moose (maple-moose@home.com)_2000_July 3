&quot;Any art that doesn't reflect the dysfunctional side of the society is an
art in denial.&quot;  Edward Norton said something to that effect about Fight
Club (you can read the transcript in the DVD version).  I think it sums up
the essence of Flight Club pretty well.  Confucius said that man is born
virtuous and another great Chinese teacher said the opposite, man is born
devilish.  It has been under great debate for hundreds of year which one
is
right.  And I said they are both right and Fight Club illustrated both
doctrine, more about the devilish one though, in style.<br /><br />This film is about what people do to survive in today's world.  We have
to be pretentious, dishonest, deceitful, fake etc and all such to get
through our day to day life.  And what do we get in return, as Tyler said,
&quot;to buy things we don't need.&quot;  So we put on make-ups, perfume, designer
dress, IKEA furniture to define ourselves and to portrait an image of
ourselves that we want other people to see.  Ironically, our society
cannot
function without all these phony smiles and bogus outlooks.<br /><br />When asked what we want to become in grade school, we all said we want to
be
professors, doctors, dentists, accountants, and lawyers.  But the reality
is
our society doesn't need 50,000 professors, doctors, lawyers and such.
Someone has to clean the street, handle the garbage, wait the table.  We
are
brought up thinking we will all be rich and famous and not the inevitable
that some of us, a good portion of us to be exact, will fail to be
anything
of any significant purpose.<br /><br />Some people might envy the condo life (I do) Norton has in the movie but
Fight Club told us that Norton is actually a member of the bottom pillar
of
the society (all condiments and not food).  These are only few of the main
points Fight Club wants to get across to the audience.  It  recited the
other side, the dysfunctional side of our society that we live in everyday
but fail to see.  We fail to see it because we don't think about it.  &quot;We
accepted the world of which we are presented.&quot;  Said Christof from the
Truman Show.<br /><br />I could image people not liking Fight Club, the old people who grew up
watching Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant will probably not liking it.  But for
young people not liking it, they probably just don't understand it.  They
don't understand it because they don't think other then the obvious.
Buying
a pair of Nike won't make you jump higher, drinking Gatorade won't make
you
Mike and getting one of those platinum credit card doesn't make you a
millionaire but only knee debt in credit card debt.<br /><br />If the movie has a flaw, it is the disappearance of Tyler at the end.  The
writers use it to explain the main plot but I think it could be done in a
better way.  And I really like the apocalyptic ending.  Not every detail
of
the movie makes sense and audience probably shouldn't expect everything
make
sense anyway.<br /><br />It's really hard to review a movie like Fight Club, Roger Ebert gave it
only
two stars out of four which I think is way too low.  Personally, I will
rate
it as high as Pulp Fiction which is 3.5 out of 4 stars.  I would recommend
young people go see Fight Club, you will discover more about yourself and
the society after watching it.<br /><br />*Edward Norton, whom I believe has been involvement in the script is
becoming a gem of the American movie.  He might turn out to be another
Woody
Allen somewhere down the line.<br /><br />
