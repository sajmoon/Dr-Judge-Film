Yes, i did hate this movie very much when i first watched
it.
i wanted to kill everyone. i hate movies with stupid masses!!
but since i love mr. norton and all of his work (and i didn't want to be a
hypocrite) i forced myself to watch it again, by myself just in case i got
the urge. to my happiness, i grew to love the movie as i'm sure you will if
you've never seen it or do if you have.
