Although I regarded Pulp Fiction as the most important and influential film
of the '90s, Fight Club would easily be my favourite. David Fincher has
created some of the most stylish and complex films of his era, first with
Se7en, which many believe as the ONLY post-Silence of the Lambs serial
killer movie to live up to the hype. Then with the criminally underrated
The
Game. In 1999 he made this, his opus.
The story is incredible complex yet deceptively simple, with perhaps the
best 'twist' in movie history. He also had the sense to cast two excellent
actors who create great chemistry and fireworks on screen. Edward Norton IS
the best actor of his generation and will win at least one Oscar. And
despite Brad Pitt's detractor's, he proves he is up to the task. It's
unfortunate that he can't seem to appear in 2 or 3 great films in a row,
for
every good film he's been in (Kalifornia, Legends of the Fall, Interview
with the Vampire, Seven, Fight Club, Snatch), he's also appeared in a
sprinkling of crap (Seven Years in Tibet, The Devil's Own, Meet Joe Black,
The Mexican). David Fincher is a true Autre, and is creating films which
will become the model and standard to which future film makers will work
by,
and be held in such esteem as Goddard, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Fellini, et.
al.
