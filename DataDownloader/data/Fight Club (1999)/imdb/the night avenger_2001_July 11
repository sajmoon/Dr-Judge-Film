2001_July 11 

When this was first released in cinemas i saw it about five times and many
more since it was released on dvd, it's probably one of the best films i
have ever seen,along with brazil and 2001 a space odyssey. It's very rarely
that you get to see a film so original and amazing that it's impossible to
pidgeon hole it. disturbing,exciting,thought provoking,compelling and what a
suprising amount of people don't realise very,very funny. If you still
have'nt seen this gem of a film yet see it now, it's true
masterpiece.<br /><br />*****/*****
