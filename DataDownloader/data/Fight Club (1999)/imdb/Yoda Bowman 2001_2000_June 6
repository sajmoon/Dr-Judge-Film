It seems as if this film was intended to be an intelligent film about our
culture, but what it turns out to be is a mismash of guys beating each
other.<br /><br />This film is far from entertainment, its more of punishment. Not because of
the violence, but because of how absolutely STUPID it is. I caught on to
what little philosophy and plot it had, and I found nothing of
interest.<br /><br />They are trying to change society by making the people understand what their
idea of society is, but what they (Pitt and Norton) dont realize is that
maybe some people dont want to be changed, maybe the people actually like
their life, even though their little Fight Club doesnt like
it.<br /><br />Why must people always try to change others. People live their life the want
to, maybe their not movie stars, but who really wants to be a movie star, it
doesnt sound like fun to be on magazines and people taking pictures of you
in your own private household. I think Fight Club missed this. It missed
that not everyones the same, people are different. This is what keeps
society going.<br /><br />This film is so full of ego's that its just sickening. As if anyone really
wants to watch two men beat each other to death. This is not fun to watch.
Violence can be handled in the right way in such films as Taxi Driver, A
Clockwork Orange, or Schindlers List. But Fight Club as none of the
qualities of these masterpieces. Its all about two big stars beating each
other and less about society.<br /><br />2/10
