This is one of those movies that I got used to hearing &quot;You can see it
when your older.&quot; Well, finally saw it and was totally amazed with
everything. The direction, th acting, everything.<br /><br />The Acting- The eye candy doesn&#39;t get much better than this. (sorry if
I come across as shallow)Brad Pitt gives a great performance, being
scary, sexy, mysterious and downright awesome with no spots in between.
Not to mention he was very, very attractive. Edward Norton, who I
couldn&#39;t get over at how fast he slimmed down for this gave an
unforgettable performance. Everything came off right, the narration,
the beating himself up (best part ever). And for last Helena Bonham
Carter, her acting was amazing, she was playing such a sleazy character
but she did it without overacting at all.<br /><br />The Direction- Perfect, the shots, the small uses of effects
everything.<br /><br />The Script- Perfect &amp; logical. With the right mix of seriousness and
humor.<br /><br />All in all: 10/10 great movie, good acting, attractive men,
fist-fighting. Don&#39;t get much better. :) <br /><br />-Hannah S.
