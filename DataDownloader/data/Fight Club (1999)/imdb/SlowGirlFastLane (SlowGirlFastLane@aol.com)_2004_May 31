Fight Club is an excellent movie that keeps you thinking about it for
days....at least that's the effect it had on me. There are elements in
the film that make you laugh, (such as the dialogue between the
narrator and &quot;Tyler Durden&quot; when they're on the plane. &quot;Do you know why
they put oxygen masks on planes&quot; &quot;so you can breathe&quot; &quot;Oxygen gets you
high........calm as Hindu cows&quot; The movie can also make you confused in
the way that The Wall does. It can also make you gag with all the
bloody fight scenes. In short, Fight Club is somewhat a comedy and
action film with a touch of creepy. Fight Club isn't for everyone,
especially those who lack satirical humor. When you watch it the first
time, it may be quite confusing until you reach the end where you get a
better understanding of it. When you watch it the second time, you
begin to notice more things (&quot;subliminal Brad&quot; appearing for instance,
when the narrator's doctor turns away or the quick flash of a penis as
the movie comes to an end lol ) I watched the movie, trying to figure
out what the message was. You think, is Fight Club the form of therapy
for men? Is it about denial and self hatred that drives a person to
imagine themselves as another person-someone who they'd like to be, but
could never be? Is it about the conformity of society...or cheating
death so that you can live tomorrow as though it were the best day of
your life? You are alive the most when you're almost dead...and that
was my take on the film. Marla never looking both ways when she crossed
the streets...Tyler Durden and his acid burn...the men of Project
Mayhem and their near death experience, and Tyler Durden giving the
liquor store owner a chance to live so that he can accomplish his
desire to become a vet. Whatever the movie was about, it's all in
perspective, and every time you watch it...you manage to think of a new
opinion. Fight Club is truly a great film, and without a doubt, an
interesting one! But of course-The first rule of Fight Club is, you do
NOT talk about Fight Club...so I guess you'll just have to watch it and
see what it's all about!
