2003_January 8 

I can stomach few modern films, but this is a stand-out movie. I was
losing
my faith in Hollywood, for its incessant turnover
of crowd-pleasing bang-bang action films, dull one-line beefcake heroes,
and
trashy, pester-power kids animation flicks. Sure,
capitalism rules, product-placement is rife, but can we not have plot,
character and a truly well-presented narrative?<br /><br />Fincher has brought us a gift in Fight Club. Over-hyped, it was not the
movie i expected. It has plot. It was
put forth with great style and skill. It was enjoyable!!<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot;, sounds like violence, infact it is. Not as much as i'd have
thought, but it's there. Some would say it's too
much, i'd say it was perfect. I would willingly watch it with my mother!
Some Bonham-Carter scenes would be a bit wierd :)
but wholly its a good film, why shirk the realities? It's not truly
distasteful! Is violence the centre-point of this film?<br /><br />I didn't really think it was, personally. Once again, its more a
statement
of modernity, and some would say 'rhetorical
masculinity!'<br /><br />Are men men? What is a man? What are people? How do we define ourself? Is
such post-modernism the way? What is love? This film
should leave you questioning all these things, and you would be a truly
good
person to take away some meaning and apply it to
life. It's not about beating-up your neighbour, or encouraging your kids
to
be vandals. It's about becoming you. And being
yourself, regardless of what you're told. Shape yourself, and live
together.<br /><br />No-one gets hurt!!
