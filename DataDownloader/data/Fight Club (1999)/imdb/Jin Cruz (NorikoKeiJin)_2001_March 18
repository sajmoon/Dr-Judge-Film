I recently saw this movie last night. I saw Edward Norton while flipping
through channels and decided to sit down and watch. After realizing it was
Fight Club I was understanding the story. Only for a little while. I've
been
thinking about how the connection between the main character and Tyler
compared to the different earlier scenes. I admit this is a VERY confusing
movie. I loved it though. It reminded me of Sixth Sense and the Nutty
Professor, just in a more dramatic and pretty sad way.
