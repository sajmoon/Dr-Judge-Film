wow.
wow.
wow.
you'll have to see this at least 3 times. everything about this movie is
right and it's about everything that is wrong. only a few months earlier
would have been a more potent time to release it (it was originally
scheduled for summer release but pushed back when people started killing
each other in public)<br /><br />David Fincher is a god. His movies so far have been very enjoyable and
powerful. They each engulf you and don't let go of you but none of them
have
come close to touching the complete immaculate piece of brutal art that
fight club is. There is so much energy here; a sense of
chaos,disillusionment, and permanence that this film will leave in you.
It's a shame that this film is already nearly gone from theaters.  There
are
so many moments that should be considered immortal classics of film.
Hopefully video will be able to capture this.<br /><br />Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Meat Loaf are all perfect in their
respective
starring roles.  This film is also a trap. It toys with all your emotions,
pushes your softspots and forces you to deal with the issues involved- and
not just those on the surface.  It's easy to understand Durden's disgust
at
the mainstream culture- the commercialization of everything, the ugly
standards of beauty, the pre-planned go-nowhere futures, self-serving
friends and acquantices,the social-darwinism that weeds out our meek weak
and
unwanted-that don't fit the stereotypes, corruption and destruction of
just
about the only things that are sacred.  and it's even easy to feel the
emasculating power of just feeling something-physically.  and it's easy to
understand how he takes it too far- how it goes to the furthest extreme.
and
as long as you're paying attention, the part of your mind that most needs
this movie- the subconscious, will get it and proceed accordingly. what do
you feel about this as a man? as a woman? what does your anima think?
animus? how about the collective? why are there no women to protect these
men? how do you really feel about everything that's been happening lately?
how do you (as a man/woman) really feel about the bonding these men share
(homoeroticisms, etc.)?<br /><br />I am Jack's complete stupification<br /><br />the icing on the cake is the awesome soundtrack by the dust brothers that
compliments the movie superbly.<br /><br />even if your not paying as much attention as you should, the end will
justify all means. it is classic and it leaves you exactly where you
started
which was the point of project:mayhem, wasn't it?
