1999_October 21 

Critics be damned.  Let them complain.  EVERYONE I have talked to agrees:
Fight Club is the best movie of the year so far.<br /><br />And you know what?  It might be the best movie of the decade!<br /><br />But that's all subjective isn't it?<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm going to see this movie again, and I'll bet the price
of my movie ticket that it'll be EVEN BETTER second time around!<br /><br />I gave this a deserving 10/10
