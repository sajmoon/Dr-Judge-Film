1999_December 17 

I've seen this movie four times. I bought the book, the score by the Dust
Brothers and The Pixies' Surfer Rosa for the &quot;Where is My Mind?&quot; tune.
Yeah,
the movie talks about consuming obsessions, but this stuff worths it. I
actually bought three books, a first copy in Spanish for me, which I read
twice, another one for a present and then the third one in English, the
original version language. Never had a film hit me as hard as this did,
Fincher direction is perfect, Edward Norton is perfect, Pitt is perfect,
Helena Bonham Carter is perfect, everything is perfect!! You can see a
movie
twice and then begin to recognize some error, but in this one you keep
yourself discovering, every time you go to the theater, a new detail to
marvel at. Now, it is a movie that doesn't let you think, even though it
was
made for clever minds, because it hardly let's you breathe. This is, it is
totally unpredictable. The plot grabs you and won't let you go till the
very
end; the result is dizzyness, an obsesive desire to see it again, insomnia
and a smile that'll last for a week. It is shocking and terribly good. If
you haven't seen it yet, YOU GOTTA GO! The book is also incredible, Chuck
Palahniuk deserves immortality; the first time, I read it thru all night
and
then the next day went to school like a zombie.
