...signifying nothing.&quot;  Nah, it wasn't that bad, just terrifically
disappointing.  The movie's first half hour does a great job exploring the
hollow nature of modern life, such as the scene where Norton's living room
is gradually &quot;furnished&quot; with items right out of the catalog, complete with
their price and description.  Yes, we've seen it before, but Norton's
performance in the first part of the film brings the script to life.  And
then along comes a solid dose of Hollywood machismo, wrapped up in a buff,
Brad Pitt package.  Now here's what I have a real problem with: all these
young men find salvation through beating each other senseless. Okay,
athletic competition has long served that purpose; remember varsity
football? But it only goes so far...and the movie's only half over.  What
does that leave: a paramilitary organization (!?!?), a weak ending, and an
attempt to turn bonding-through-brutality into a way of life. No doubt, it
sells tickets, but it defeats its own purpose. Norton's character has been
destroyed by modern life; it's a shame that all that's left him is
destroying others' bodies. And apartments. And credit ratings. Ho
hum.
