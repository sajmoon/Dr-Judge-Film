When first released, Fight Club was panned by most critics probably just
because it was the safe thing to do.  Fight Club brings up many dangerous
thoughts that might actually be true.  The film Fight Club is not only about
the title club, it's also about a man's (Edward Norton) plunge into near
insanity due to insomnia and can't seem to find a solution.  This was until
he met the rebellious Tyler Durden.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a man who
is against everything that's materialistic and artificial.  This includes
big business and models among other things.  Both men decide to come up with
a club all men can work out their aggressions bearing the name Fight Club. 
Director David Fincher paints a dark and gritty film depicting a man's life
spiraling out of control and the man who brings his life back into
perspective (or so it seems).  The ending cannot be matched in sheer
surprise.  Even &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; cannot compare.  This movie requires
repeat viewings and IMO is second to only &quot;The Matrix&quot; for the year 1999 .
