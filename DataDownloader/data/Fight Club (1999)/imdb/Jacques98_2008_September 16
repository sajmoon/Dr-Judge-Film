Beyond anything I&#39;m about to say, I just don&#39;t understand how people
can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself
excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and
going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The
humor was so juvenile and clich&eacute;, I can&#39;t say I laughed once&#151;I heard
the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as
entertainment value goes, I can&#39;t see anything redeeming. Every 10
minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because
nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no
story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.<br /><br />Being a man, I&#39;ve heard the clich&eacute; &quot;We&#39;re men raised by women!&quot; so many
times I can&#39;t even take it seriously anymore. That clich&eacute; has existed
since then 60&#39;s, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now
this takes that clich&eacute; and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone
who is calling this &quot;daring&quot; or &quot;original&quot; needs to understand
something: it takes no more balls the take a clich&eacute; and build a movie
around it than it does to remake something.<br /><br />The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of
&quot;We&#39;re men raised by women!&quot;, so I&#39;m not going to. Go read their
reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no
one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I
could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer
being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way.
Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie
said so. That&#39;s because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute
truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such
as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alive&#151;but the
film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you
were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of
them would feel just as alive as men&#151;once again, the film doesn&#39;t admit
that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow
clich&eacute; that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main
flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and
original itself, which it&#39;s not, the story would at least admit that it
is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the
fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something
fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes,
fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be
manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to
understand&#151;including false reality. Basing an entire view on something
based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.<br /><br />Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid
storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a
story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is
insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if
you ignore the fact you&#39;ve heard every bit of humor on the playground
and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car
crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed
chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point
until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was
over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and
leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively,
the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale.
Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount
to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could
have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things
that weren&#39;t supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists
into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all
ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to
add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn&#39;t
work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even
close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.<br /><br />In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is
brilliant. On the other hand, I can&#39;t understand anyone out of junior
high who shouldn&#39;t see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But
maybe I&#39;m looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I&#39;m trying
to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This
just a poor excuse to preach clich&eacute;s you&#39;ve heard all your life, not to
entertain. It&#39;s an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less.
If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just
downright boring.<br /><br />5/10
