1999_October 30 

Every now and then there comes a movie that defines the feeling of its time
and generation. They are not always acsepted by everyone, especially the
critic. But after 10 years they become classics. I think Fight club is one
of them. A satire on our society and the meaningless consumerism that
surrounds us.<br /><br />The main character is a so anonymous and normal that we never get to know
his name. Edward Norton is credited as the narrator. He lives a life
consumed in material values. He cant seem to find a meaning in his life,
hes
strugling to do exactly what everyone else want him to do, just going with
the flow, not questioning anything. How many of us have not felt this way
before. Tormented by insomnia (Doctor: no, you cant die of insomnia), he
joins support group for testicular cancer. Where he experiences the
pleasure
of crying in another persons arms. He is now addicted. In his words he
explains his addiction: When people think your dying, they finally shut up
and listen to what you have to say. Thats when Marla coms in an equally
fake support-addict who the narator describes as : &quot;a little scratch on the
roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tounging it--but
you can't&quot;<br /><br />In the top of his depression the narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man with a
vision and a philosophy &quot;its only after we've lost everything that we we're
free to do anything&quot;.<br /><br />Wow im blown away<br /><br />This film is more inteligent than it actually looks
Ironical to the bone. Filmed with camera techniques that reminde us of
comercials. This film deals with the masculin selfdestruction or rage. Its
about a whitecolar worker who creates a fighting club. Where males can come
and beat the shit out of each other, as a way of letting out their steam
and
confusion.The film tries to explore the dehumanization of our culture. A
hard thing to do whithout being provocative.<br /><br />Masterly made both technically and acting wise. Both Edward Norton and Brad
Pitt give expeptional performances<br /><br />Industrial noise music by Dust brothers,nicely edited and filmed, blending
computer generated effects with story. This is indeed filmmaking at its
finest. A testament that once in a while the hollywood machinery can
actually produce a gem that could not have been possible any other way.<br /><br />a film constantly turning from reality to the absurd fantasy. The twists
and
turns keep you on the edge of your seat,. And did i mention that the film
has twist that will blow you away ? Keeping true to his tradition, David
Fincher cooks up a hell of a an ending that will blow you
away.<br /><br />A film no adult movie fan can dare to miss, and this is a film for adults,
mind you. This is an intelligent film, and David Fincher is a
master.<br /><br />Gems like this don't grow on trees....
