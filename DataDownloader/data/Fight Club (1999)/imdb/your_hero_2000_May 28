I was extremely impressed with this movie.  When I first heard about it, I
thought that it wasn't going to be too good, but then I saw it and it blew
me away.  This movie is a very good example of what Edward Norton is
capable
of doing, along with the reinvention of Brad Pitt and his tremendous acting
talent.  I highly suggest seeing it.
