The first rule of fight club is....YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB The
second rule of fight clube is..........YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB
Oh, this is one of those movies that makes anyone seem like a genius
afterwards. I don't mean this in any rude way, but it leaves you with
some unknown intelligence, as for example, months after I saw this
movie, my husband, my BIL and I sat down for hours examining the inner
meanings of FIGHT CLUB. It was so mind-blowing, and really not your
typical Hollywood movie. I think I quote this movie at least one time
per day, and it makes it even more fun when I say something from Fight
Club and a complete stranger laughs, or repeats something back. It is
like being apart of it. I really love this movie, and highly recommend
it
