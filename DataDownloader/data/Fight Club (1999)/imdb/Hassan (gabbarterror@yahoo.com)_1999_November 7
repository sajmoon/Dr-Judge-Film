Fight Club is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is an
intense picture that leaves the viewer with some type of an effect and a
lesson. The movie to me has a very interesting theme. Once you leave all
your things and your self too, then only do you arise. A pretty good script
and amazing performances by both Edward and Brad. Finally hollywood is
getting there.
