1999_November 13 

Overlong (2&frac12; hours) but it had something to say. This movie is *not* about
fighting! The fight clubs are simply an expression of people's frustrations.
The movie is about the shallowness and materialism of contemporary society -
the emptiness and pointlessness of existence. It's interesting that it
focuses on these feelings within men - not women. The movie has parallels
with The Matrix and I think if you like one then you'll like the other. Good
movie. I gave it 8/10. The fourth good movie of '99 (after The Matrix, South
Park and Sixth Sense).
