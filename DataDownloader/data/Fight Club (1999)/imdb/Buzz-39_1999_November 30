1999_November 30 

At last a film that looks at our existence for what it has become. About
time somebody realized that guys should really act like guys again and not
some a-sexual creature afraid to live, who works to no end in the hope of
retiring in Florida with all the other slaves to our system. Remember what
it used to be like to be alive.
