I had actually rented this movie without any real idea as to what it was
about. Like many people, I had seen the ads and heard reviews which focused
100% on the violence in the movie, and had assumed that it was a shallow
romp about guys beating each other senseless. I was quite
wrong.<br /><br />To give an incredibly short summary: Nameless narrator (Norton) suffers from
insomnia and an incredibly bland life with no meaning behind it. He goes to
support groups for ailments he doesn't have and is okay, but after a woman
shows up who is also faking he can no longer go. He meets up with Tyler
Durden (Pitt) and they create Fight Club, gaining an extraordinary amount of
members, and from there things continue to get more bizarre.<br /><br />Now that doesn't tell nearly anything about the movie, simply an idea of
what happens. It is easily the most cerebral movie I have ever seen
(possibly tied with Being John Malkovich), and once it starts you can't stop
watching. Every aspect of the movie is 100% original and you will find
yourself watching it numerous times, because you cannot possibly catch
everything the first time through.
