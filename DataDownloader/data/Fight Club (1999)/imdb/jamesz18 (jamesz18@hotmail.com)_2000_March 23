This is the film that set the trend followed by the much more viewer
friendly 'American Beauty': a rejection of the values which underpin middle
class America.  Whilst 'American Beauty' succeeds in its aching poignancy
and wistful rhetoric, 'Fight Club' assaults the senses with frenetic
direction and a much greater adrenaline injection.  One thing the two films
have in common are stellar performances by the central actors.<br /><br />Much is always said of Ed Norton, and here he is on fine form as usual.  But
for me, this is Brad Pitt's film.  Looking as though his body has been
carved out of stone, it is he who fills the screen with something which
resembles charisma, but verges more on animal magnetism.<br /><br />The imagery of emasculation is very clever. And the anti-society message is
forced home by Fincher's most stylish, and yes, his best, movie to date.
'Fight Club' is much more stark than 'American Beauty'.  It does not seek to
find the beauty in living, but seeks to tell us that one day we are going to
die, and that only by destroying ourselves can we ever hope to make
something better.<br /><br />Perhaps where the film suffers is by its establishment of a concept which
cannot be given any satisfactory conclusion.  The film itself loses itself
towards the end.  But this reflects the film's message, and is unavoidable.<br /><br />Such minor criticisms aside, 'Fight Club' is a film good to see at least
twice, for reasons that will become obvious once it has been seen once.  It
actually seems, in my experience, to be the most re-watched film at the
cinema I can remember, with countless people returning for a second, third,
and even fourth watch.  And it is the only film I know of which is actually
a significant improvement upon the book it is based on.<br /><br />Go and see it.
