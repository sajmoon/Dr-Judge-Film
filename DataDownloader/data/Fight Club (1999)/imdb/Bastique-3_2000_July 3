2000_July 3 

We had rented the Special Edition on DVD the day our DVD broke.  Returning
the movie, we picked up the video.  I'm sorry we had to see it on
Videocassette--we are going to buy the DVD to see it in letterbox.<br /><br />I was enthralled with Edward Norton's performance from the very start.  I
felt as if I left the room I would miss something, and my eyes were
focused
on the screen for the duration of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is intense, but it has very sophisticated undertones.  Children,
especially teenage boys, may enjoy the movie for the violence, but only
the
most mature or intelligent will truly comprehend the reasoning behind the
fighting.<br /><br />I have to add that I sympathized heavily with our characters.  Being 33
myself, I am a member of that &quot;forgotten&quot; generation--the Post-Baby
Boomers
born during the duration of the Vietnam War.  We're slaves to a society
run
by our parents and owned by our grandparents.  Anarchy may not be the
answer, but it sure seems to deserve consideration--if only for a fleeting
moment.
