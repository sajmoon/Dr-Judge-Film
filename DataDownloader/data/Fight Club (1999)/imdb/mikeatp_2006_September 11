This is by far one the best movies that has ever been made. This movie
ignores the guidelines that Hollywood has set down that a movie should
be, a completely slaps &quot;Americas&quot; idea for the perfect and expected
life style in the face. Edward Norton wasn&#39;t just right for this role
he was made for this role. And teaming him up with Pitt was priceless.
I would recommend this movie to anyone with eyes. To those who don&#39;t
like this movie I hear there making another 50 cent movie maybe that
will strike your interest. <br /><br />&quot;we have no great war, and we have no great <br /><br />depression, Our great war is a spiritual war<br /><br />our great depression is our lives!!!
