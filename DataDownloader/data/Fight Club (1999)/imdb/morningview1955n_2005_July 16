There is absolutely no argument that anyone could make against this
movie that is valid. The direction is flawless, the action is intense,
the acting is captivating, the way it's shot, edited, written, I could
go on for days.Then there's it's true selling point; it's ability to be
seen from multiple angles. Many young men (such as myself, I'll admit
it), are Tyler followers and believe that his words are the way to
freedom, but the thing that's great is that the movie never really
passes judgement on him. It allows you to (if you feel so inclined)
dismiss Tyler as a mad man and view all the consequences of his and
Nortons characters as the results of a life lead without enough
restraint. It is a film that really makes you think about how you feel
on so many of lifes major issues and it tests you to put it in your own
words instead of spoon feeding you the answers. Someday, this will be
referred to as a classic.
