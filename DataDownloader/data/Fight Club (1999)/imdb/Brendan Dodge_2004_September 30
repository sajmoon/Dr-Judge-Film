I just read this guys review, and i really need to start looking for a
job as a reviewer, because the majority of them must still be living in
their mothers basement (not that that has to be bad!). This movie was
about what all of us want deep inside, except maybe the really rich
ones. It is about the fact that no-one is happy with their lives
anymore, you can pretend to love it, but we want a better world, for
ourselves and our children. I would like a more fulfilling world. Face
it, their is so much poverty and death, and then we have satellites and
big TV's and huge cars, that less-than-one-percent that rules this
planet doesn't want to hear about how people are not fulfilled these
days, they refuse to. Some day the working masses will rise up, as they
did against the royalty of old, and decide to take what is rightfully
ours, and this film expresses that in a creative way. I know a lot about
films, and this one is in my top 20 Sincerely, Brendan-
