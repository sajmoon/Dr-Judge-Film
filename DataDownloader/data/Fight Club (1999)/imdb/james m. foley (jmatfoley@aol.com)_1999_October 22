1999_October 22 

Three Academy Award performances and Fincher's most amusing direction are
largely wasted in a movie that lacks the courage to make a statement.  Okay,
let's not say wasted, I was entertained by most all of the movie before they
damaged it with the worst ending of the year.  (I'm trying to remember what
year it would have not been the worst ending.)
  In any event the ending renders their tough guy rhetoric into so much soft
soap, not so much thought-provoking as nerd justifying.
