This movie just grows on me more and more. I liked it when I first saw it in
cinema, but after my second viewing I liked it even more. Now, after having
seen it on DVD two more times, I have grown to absolutely love
it!<br /><br />It is now one of my favorite films. I just changed my rating from 8 (my
original rating after 2 viewings in the cinema) to 10.<br /><br />An absolutely brilliant film with outstanding performances from all 3 of the
main cast. Edward Norton shines specifically brightly.
