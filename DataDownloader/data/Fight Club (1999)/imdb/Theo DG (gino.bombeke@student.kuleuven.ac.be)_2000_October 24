Wait a minute!  I was glad to have the opportunity to see Fight Club this
evening, everybody seemed to find this a fantastic, innovating and
satirical
film... but what a mistake!  Two hours of rubbish, wrapped in a terrible
written story, even not worth a lazy sunday afternoon.  Striking was E.
Norton, who never played a different role since 'American History X',
early
retirement foundations could be a solution.  And what is wrong with you
America?  The poster of 'The people vs. Larry Flint' was enough to put
your
country upside-down, as was the title 'Sex Crimes' - nicely replaced by
'Wild Things'.  But hitting people, almost mutilating them, non-realistic
and disgusting kick-some-faces-for-a-few-minutes-scenes are no problem for
you.  All the people who advised me to see this movie can count on a
little
bit of angryness for the next two days, all the people who haven't seen
the
film yet, PLEASE, DON'T DO IT.
