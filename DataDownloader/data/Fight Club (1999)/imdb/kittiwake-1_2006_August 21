I don&#39;t get caught out by movies. I always know everything within the
first 5-20 minutes of a movie. Well, not this time! I loved it for more
than that. The acting was perfect. Who would have thought I&#39;d actually
like Brad Pitt in anything? (I&#39;m a not-fan of Brad.) Edward Norton, oh,
how wonderful you can be. The plot is well-conceived. The violence,
although sometimes kind of gory, is well-presented. You&#39;ll think it is
all real. How far-fetched, yet how believable! Men, fighting to realize
their manhood. To take back their right as men to be aggressive. To be
physical. To take out their frustrations on each other and yet come out
of it friends. Women don&#39;t do that, but anyone who has seen playground
fights between guys knows: once the violence is over, you&#39;re best
buddies. Very well done!
