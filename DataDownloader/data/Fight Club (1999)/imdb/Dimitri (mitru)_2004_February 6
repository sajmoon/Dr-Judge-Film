The plot? You are not your job. You are not your khakis. You are not a
beautiful and unique snowflake. Self improvement is masturbation, or self
destruction. The things you own end up owning you. It's only after you've
lost everything that you're free to do anything. In Tyler we trusted. You
are not the contents of your wallet. You are not how much money you have
in
the bank. - Lines like this are what this movie is all about. It's not a
movie I will ruin with a plot synopsis, but rather, just tell you the
following: This is the best movie ever made. I realize that's a bold
statement, but every part of this movie blew me away. From Ed Norton and
Brad Pitt's performance, to the visuals, to the lines, to the plot, I love
this movie. This isn't a rental. This is a purchase. This is a movie that
men will love, and watch over and over again.
