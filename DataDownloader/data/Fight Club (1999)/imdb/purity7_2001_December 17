Unbelievably excellent film, with brilliant directing, and quality acting.
Every single aspect of this film is ingenious on so many levels, and
everything ties together and fits in so well and it's all just so
incredibly
ultimately amazing. If you haven't seen this film, then do so your life
won't be complete without it.
