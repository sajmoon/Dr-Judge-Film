I think that the place that Fight Club was headed in the beginning was much
more interesting than the place where it wound up in the end. It's almost
like the producers saw Sixth Sense and decided that they needed a cool
twist
ending too and threw one in as an afterthought. Suffering from the same
disease as The Matrix, three very good movies could have been made from
ideas in Fight Club. Instead, they tossed all of them into one film,
cheapening each of them and diffusing what focus the movie might have had.
While the film does have a very hip look and a great feel, I couldn't help
feeling cheated at the end.
