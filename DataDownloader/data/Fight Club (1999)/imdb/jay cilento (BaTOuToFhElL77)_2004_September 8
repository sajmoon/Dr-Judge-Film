Fight Club is one of the best films I have seen in my time. With a
great cast such as movie stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and
including the hit singer Meat Loaf (Marvin L. Aday). Each actor made
such a performance. I give the cast and crew of Fight club a standing
ovation. If you only think Meat loaf could sing perfectly, you should
see his acting, he is not only an amazing singer/actor he is probably
in my opinion the most multi talented celebrity around. Make sure to
buy his Cd: Couldn't Have said It better Myself and for his last and
finale cd of the two best selling cds around Meat loaf is creating a
3rd Bat out of hell cd, so go out and buy. You should go out and rent,
buy or borrow this movie it will actually impact your life.
