What we all want when we sits ourselves down in a cinema is to be effected
in some way. To many times it's just an short escape from the reality and
nothing you carry with you for a longer period of time. This is NOT the case
with this excellent masterpiece. <br /><br />In a media world that's been dominated with feministic fanatical bull-s***
it's really refreshing to see this manly reaction to our frustrating time.
Yes, so we are men. We can't possible be women or want to be it anyway. This
movie stands up to the big questions of our time. Materialism, inter sexual
relations, fascism and career slavery. So what, if you don't get very
obvious pointers to what's right and what's wrong, that the whole point of
it. Think for yourself, that the only freedom you'll ever truly have.<br /><br />
