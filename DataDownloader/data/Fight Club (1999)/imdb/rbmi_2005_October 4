While I have seen worse movies than Fight Club, this movie does not
warrant a second viewing. While its gotcha twists are interesting they
really push the barrier and for not a whole lot of result. While I
think there is a story in this movie, I did not find it well made or
particularly well written. And I did not see anything that I would call
funny. (or brilliant for that mater.)<br /><br />Acting is OK. Writing is OK (which is better than average these days)
but it seemed like a silly exercise rather than a story. Maybe its an
age thing-I am 50 and twists just don't impress me as much anymore.
Maybe its a female thing- the fighting seemed to go on and on and on.
And while clever, in the end it seemed just stupid.
