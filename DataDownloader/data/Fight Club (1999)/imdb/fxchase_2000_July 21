2000_July 21 

I, like most people before seeing this film, was led to believe by the
trailers that this film was going to be another feeble attempt at
legitimizing a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; class of B movie.  After seeing it for the
first time it became obvious that this was not the case.  Fight Club is
undoubtedly one of the most original and entertaining film I have
witnessed
in quite some time.<br /><br />Virtually every aspect of this film works: the direction, acting, script,
dialogue, and even the streamlined non-plot that somehow becomes an
interesting one out of thin air.  Unfortunately the absolute ending does
prove a bit weak but by the time you have reached that point in the film
it
really doesn't matter.  By the time the ending has arrived I found myself
more entertained than I would have ever expected from such a frankly,
sophomoric title.  I was very pleasantly surprised with every
aspect.<br /><br />The unfortunate aspect of this film was very likely the title.  A few
besides myself may remember mild protests and talk shows berating the
irresponsible behavior of the producers of the film for making such a
violent, repulsive piece of work.  I feel quite sure after seeing this
film
that the verbal tirade-tossers had not seen much of the film other than
the
trailers.  This film has half of the &quot;violence for the sake of violence&quot;
type of sequences than The Patriot or an even better example The Gladiator
contain.  Oddly, no one has complained about the multiple beheadings in
either of these films who clearly had to have the violence to fill the
void
the plot and the script couldn't manage.  This is not the case of Fight
Club.<br /><br />I find it disappointing that a lot of people will not see this film based
purely on its title.  Violence is not the moral to this story: It seems to
be more of a consequence in the lives of the characters.  This film is
about
finding yourself and ultimately realizing you are what you are and
learning
to deal with it or decide to step over the edge.  And it's actually quite
funny at times as an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />I have personally heard quite a bit of grumbling about the &quot;impossibility&quot;
factor of some of the events of the film, and honestly can't
whole-heartedly
disagree.  The question I would ask those who stake this claim as a reason
to call this a bad film: Did you believe that monkeys could fly after
seeing
The Wizard of Oz?  I would think that the virtual IKEA catalogue would
have
triggered most to accept this movie as something other than a
documentary.<br /><br />The Verdict: Funny, slick, smart, angry, original and memorable. The first
rule of Fight Club: Don't let a few media-hyped naysayers push you away
from
an extremely original and entertaining film.
