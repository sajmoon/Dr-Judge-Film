1999_December 2 

One of the best films to come out this year. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt
have been excellently cast in to this film, bringing the whole atmosphere
and story to life. <br /><br />Some people say it is a violent film, and it is, but without condoning such
violence. It can be graphic at times yet this is not what makes the film
ticks. It is a combination of many things, from the characters, the dark
humour and the main story of the film.<br /><br />Shame that in Hong Kong, the marketing for the film wasn't as big as it
should be. Another one lost to the shallow culture of Hong Kong. Great shame
indeed.
