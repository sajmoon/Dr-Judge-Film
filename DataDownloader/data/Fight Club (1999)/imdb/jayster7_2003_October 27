Fight Club is one of those movies that is incredible the first time you
see
it... but even better when you watch it again because it's viewed from a
different perspective the second time around.<br /><br />Edward Norton gives a great performance, and even Brad Pitt, who I
normally
hate, finds himself on my good side in this flick.  I'm a white male in
his
late 20's working for corporate America... I've never really done anything
wild, I've played by the rules, and I've never been in a fight.  Maybe
that's why I love the movie so much... but I think my ability to relate to
Norton's character is just a small reason why I loved this film so
much.<br /><br />The movie tells an interesting story in an entertaining and
thought-provoking way, delivers a message for our generation, and in a
strange way, still includes a love story (although twisted).<br /><br />In summary, this movie gets my #1 recommendation!
