&#x22;That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love? Well, it works
both ways.&#x22; &#x96; Narrator<br /><br />While it flopped upon its initial release and received Luke-warm
reviews at best, &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; has worked its way over the years to
becoming perhaps the biggest and best cult film of all time. Directed
by David Fincher (&#x22;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&#x22;) the film is as
famous for its unique visual style as it is for its nihilistic and dark
comedic tone. Its tale of anarchy was, in a way, a refreshing slap to
the face of the mainstream, which is what makes it such a beautiful and
unique film, and it still holds up just as well today, over ten years
later.<br /><br />Starring Edward Norton as the Narrator, &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; tells the story of
a man living in a sterilized environment, suffering from insomnia and
yearning to unleash his pent-up angst. He doesn&#x27;t know why he can&#x27;t
sleep and perhaps he is going crazy, but things only get more
interesting when he stumbles upon an interesting character in Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt) who essentially resembles everything he himself is
not. United, they take to the underground and form a fight club where
grown men can come and pummel the snot out of one another in good fun.
Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Tyler&#x27;s plans get out of
hand and a troubled woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) comes between the two
conflicted personalities.<br /><br />The film is drawn from a bold novel by Chuck Palahniuk and is about as
anti-Hollywood as a major studio film can be. Edward Norton breaks
through in perhaps his finest role to date, capturing all the humor and
melodramatic baggage that comes with the character exquisitely, while
Brad Pitt gets a chance to go over the top in a way that few actors can
handle. The film is over two-hours long, but is paced just right so
that you lose track of time and feel immersed in the narrative each and
every time. No doubt, it&#x27;s one of Fincher&#x27;s finest films and one of the
best examples of film in the 1990&#x27;s. Even after the twist has revealed
itself, &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is a movie worth coming back to time and time
again.
