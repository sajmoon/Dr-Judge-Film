David Fincher as expected ... the dark dinamics of the story drives you in
at the very beginning of the picture and and kicks you out of the story like
you have been dreaming your own dream. <br /><br />Watch for hidden pictures that appear for a second ... what you see is what
you get, even if you are not sure about what it really is ...
was!<br /><br />Rule number one, you never talk about the story of the Fight Club. Rule
number two, you never talk about the story of the Fight Club. Rule number
three, you have to see Fight Club!
