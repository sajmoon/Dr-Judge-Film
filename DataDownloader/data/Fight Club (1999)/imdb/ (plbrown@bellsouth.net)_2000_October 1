Fight club is not entertaining, it's a wake-up call for every one. It is
the
best because it's different there is no movie like it. this and Shawshank
Redemption are the only films that i can watch repeditly. Screw the critics
what do they know. American Beauty is terrible yet it walk away with 5
oscers(including best picture) which it stole from The Green Mile. Fight
Club, pulls you in describes your life and leaves you thinking.
