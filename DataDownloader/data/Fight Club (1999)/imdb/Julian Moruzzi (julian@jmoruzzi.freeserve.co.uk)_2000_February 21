After an hour-and-a-half or so of 'Fight Club', things seemed to be drawing
nicely to a close.  &quot;How refreshing,&quot; I thought, &quot;a contemporary big-budget
movie that doesn't feel the need to prove its importance by dragging its
unwilling bulk across the two-hour line.&quot;  Then all of a sudden there was a
plot development straight out of 'The Twilight Zone' and the ruddy thing
went on another 45 minutes!  Hadn't been terribly impressed by it
anyway.
