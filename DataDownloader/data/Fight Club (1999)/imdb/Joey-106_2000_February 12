Fight Club was one of the best films of 1999, Brad Pitt is excellent as
Tyler Durden, Ed Norton is equally as good as the narrator.
From the Visually stunning opening sequence to the credits, fight club had
me glued to the screen, it was not at all hard to follow, and the violence
wasn't as bad as i'd expected it to be.
Alot of people over-analyse films like Fight Club saying that they will
trigger copycat violence, i think these people should stop looking to the
movies for excuses to explain why such tragic things happen in our
society.
Anyway, great film. 9/10
