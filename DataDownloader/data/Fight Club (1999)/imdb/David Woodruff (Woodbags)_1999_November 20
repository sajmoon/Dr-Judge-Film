1999_November 20 

Firstly I must point out the obvious, this film contains scenes of extreme
violence. When I went to see it there were only eight people in the entire
cinema [including me]; 3 of these (about 40%) left early. I was not one of
them!!!!<br /><br />I cannot explain why I liked it so much, it was so dominating.
