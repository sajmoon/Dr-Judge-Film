I guess all I can say is that Fight Club is just another reason why I love
movies. While I hate those &quot;standard&quot; Hollywood types ie. Double Jeopardy,
anything that's different, questions the status quo, ridicules our society
and leaves the audience wondering what did it really mean, gets thumbs up.
Just like &quot;The Matrix&quot; this movie left me wanting more. Loved the camera
work, angles and supporting soundtrack. The Dust Brothers dark technoish
tunes are perfect. Gotta love when a movie becomes more than 2 hour event
that you sit through munching your popcorn and sucking on that pop. More,
more, more!<br /><br />I am still &quot;digesting&quot; what I saw and I'll be going back soon. Was the
imagery offensive? Yeah, but I think we've all seen worst. Conrats to all
parties involved.
