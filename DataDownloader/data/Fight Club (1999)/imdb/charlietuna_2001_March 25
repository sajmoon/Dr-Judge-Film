Fincher picks up where he left off with &quot;The Game&quot; and finally hits his
stride.  Whereas &quot;The Game&quot; was a movie trying desperately to be novel,
&quot;Fight Club&quot; succeeded as being the best black comedic satire in several
years.  While the mainstream critics once again missed the boat, getting
side tracked by the movie's violence and neo-fascist imagery, Fincher,
Norton, et al. sat back and laughed.  Easily the most original movie of the
year, &quot;Fight Club&quot; illustrated how creative CGI can be in a movie that isn't
a standard action adventure romp.  Splicing in Tyler Durden's image at key
moments added to the richness of a story that was as tightly told as the
&quot;Usual Suspects&quot;.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a must see film, not for its gimmicks,
action scenes, or visual effects, it is a must see film because it is funny.
 Funny???  Yes folks funny.  In-between the blood and vandalism there are
classic lines about Generation X and in particular the &quot;X&quot; men
as
Durden quips:<br /><br />&quot;Our generation has had no Great Depression, no Great War. Our war is a
spiritual war. Our depression is our lives.&quot;<br /><br />and<br /><br />&quot;We are a generation of men raised by women. I'm beginning to wonder if
another woman is what we really need.&quot;<br /><br />If you sat in the theater taking this movie on its face as a film about a
psychopath and his desire to re-order the world, I would hope you had
problems with it.  If however, you got the joke and saw the film as slap in
the face of an entire generation of weak, materialistic, and gullible kids
looking for meaning between the pages of self help books and Saks Fifth Ave.
you laughed along with me and recognized this a great film.
