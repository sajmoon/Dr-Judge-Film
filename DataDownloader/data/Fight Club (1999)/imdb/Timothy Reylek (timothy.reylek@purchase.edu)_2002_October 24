Hi! My name is average movie watcher! I think David fincher is cool
because
his movies have quirky dialogue and the camera moves EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />Wow! This guy is different! He speaks on my level! He represents my
restless
teenagerery!<br /><br />But can he capture emotions?<br /><br />Can his camera zoom all the way through a house, down the block, under
traffic and straight to our hearts?<br /><br />No. He blows.<br /><br />This movie is the most over-rated piece of MTV generation garbage I have
ever seen. I have given it a chance by watching it four times, and it got
worse each time.<br /><br />I have heard people talking about how it, &quot;made them re-think their lives
and how they view the world,&quot;. I'm sorry guys, but this movie doesn't
make
me think about anything but NOT SEEING IT AGAIN!<br /><br />Please, find yourselfs a better movie to &quot;change your lives&quot;. I would
suggest Spielberg's masterpiece &quot;A.I.&quot;, or if you're a Ed Norton fan,
watch
&quot;American History X,&quot; or if you can handle some reading, and I hope you
can,
why don't you rent &quot;Life is Beautiful?&quot;<br /><br />Now, I am not trying to say &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a terrible movie, it does
have
it's good aspects, but please, its not revoloutionary in any way and it
won't change your life.<br /><br />Thank you. Please, feel free to e-mail me. I
would love to hear your comments.<br /><br />Thanks and take care,<br /><br />Tim
