...in which pretty much the only aspect that doesn&#39;t totally disappoint
is the cinematography (basically an elaboration of the set design on
&quot;Seven&quot;). Even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated
(some &quot;brothers&quot; or someone). Norton is the kind of actor whom you
either can or cannot watch (I haven&#39;t totally decided yet), Bonham
Carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent (Woody Allen obviously
hasn&#39;t helped), and Pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room
sequence with Norton (anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is
either lying or is deluded - the guy just looks good with cropped
hair). Other than this we&#39;re looking at a film made for awkward teenage
boys who can&#39;t watch it anyway cause it&#39;s mostly rated 18. It&#39;s the
slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up
slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it. A little rubbish
goes a long way these days.<br /><br />Having appreciated both &quot;The Game&quot; and especially &quot;Seven&quot;, I&#39;d like to
think Fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it.
Let&#39;s see what happens next.
