2007_December 5 
David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a
wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of
his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is &quot;the look&quot; and the
promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton
is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad
Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a
plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had
never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as
Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that
&quot;but&quot; is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is
nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I&#39;m
sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something
that is as powerful inside as it is outside.
