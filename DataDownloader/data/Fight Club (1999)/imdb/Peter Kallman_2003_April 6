I'm sorry but all the people who thought this movie was too robust, too
over
the top, to blatant, that was the point of the book and the movie.  This
movie is revolutionary, it sets forth a philosophy unparalleled by any,
Pluto, Socrates, these guys have nothing on Tyler Durden.  People need to
really watch this movie and realize how trapped they are by society and
the
way they live their lives.  Personally, I'm trying to hit rock
bottom.
Ciao.
