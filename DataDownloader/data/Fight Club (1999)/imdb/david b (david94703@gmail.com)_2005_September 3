If you haven't read Civilization and Its Discontents, or if you read it
and didn't feel you got it, try it again. It's about the tension
between instinct and culture. And Konrad Lorenz's On Aggression, mostly
derivative of Freud's little book, does some useful updating.<br /><br />Dogs are aggressive, ready to fight at the slightest sense of threat.
Pet dogs do a pretty good job of subsuming their aggressions. But they
have one hell of a pack instinct to help them out. With presumably
equally strong aggressive instincts but no pack instinct to speak of,
what do humans do with their aggressions in order to stay out of jail
and in social good graces?
