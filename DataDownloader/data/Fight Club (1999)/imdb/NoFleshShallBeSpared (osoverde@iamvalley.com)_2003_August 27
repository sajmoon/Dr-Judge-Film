Yes, when this movie was released, I remembered going to see it and
afterwards leaving the theater, where a good friend and I proceeded to beat
the snot out of each other. Onlookers decided that we were both crazy, and
we were for the sake of having the sort of sick and twisted fun that people
of our generation find too much or no meaning in.<br /><br /> I've read into what many people have said for this film, either they didn't
get it, they did get some of the many points that this film presents but
doesn't necessarily address, or they loved it for it whole parts or were
simply disgusted by it. <br /><br />Going back to what someone said about recent politics and the impact on
American society that has come of it, I was too, reminded of that by this
movie. We all may hate the compliant nature that has been imposed by society
upon us (or those who would rather not address this conundrum), but when
your numb to certain aspects of yourself or the peoples around you, basal
nature starts to dictate your actions, thoughts, etc. <br /><br />But one point I think is sorely missed is the fact that this nature, without
one's own sense of identity or critical thought, can easily persuaded and
perverted. Even more so, the manipulation of this human nature (which is
viewed as one part of what makes an individual unique) can bring about
insecurities in the individual being manipulated. <br /><br />It's almost as if this movie had some intention of being an extensive
character study. I can say this about this terrific movie, it has something
that anyone can take from it, otherwise it's an experience of relatively
engrossing subject matter. <br /><br />You must watch it, I got *****, I'm sure you'll get something out of it.
