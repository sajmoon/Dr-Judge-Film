This is my favorite movie of all times, so please, before you start reading
this review, keep in mind that.<br /><br />I mean, this movie is a pure &amp; direct attempt of shocking the establishment,
it's like a bloody punch in your teeth, a reality present naked &amp; ugly as it
can be. I read a review of this guy named Derek Dammann (or something), who
said that this movie is fulfilled with plot holes. Mr. Dammann, there is a
way of difference between reading a masterpiece in a literal sense, or an
allegorical sense. This movie is a constant irony, can't you see it? It's an
irony about everything, it's an eternal denial in jest code about our
western civilization way of living, more simple but as catchy as any
philosophical theory, for me!<br /><br />For all this, plus I loved its speed &amp; rawness, &amp; all the camera tricks (&amp;
hidden ideas &amp; images that makes this film deserve more than a view to
criticize it, Mr. Dammann), I consider it one of the truly masterpieces of
filming in the last 20 years.<br /><br />
