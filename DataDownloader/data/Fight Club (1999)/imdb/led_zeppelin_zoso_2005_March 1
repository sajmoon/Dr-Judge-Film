All time favorite, This movie will take you to a place you have never
been before were you give your self licenses to fight, drink and screw
over others. I was amazed by how David Fincher was able to capture me
with these peoples thoughts and feelings. I loved how Tyler was such a
different character but he was actually just like all of us in a way.
This is by far Finchers best work but I hope to see even better from
him in the future because he is the master at spinning our minds with
confusion. Just like in Se7en he will capture you and make you feel as
if you are one of the characters because of the depth of this movie.<br /><br />Before I rented this movie I thought it was going to be a bunch of guys
beating the crap out of each other until one of them ended up in the
hospital. But as soon as I saw it I knew it was much more than just
that, of course it contained some brutal fight scenes but it had a
sense of depth to it, there was much more going on than what you
expected, David Fincher, the man behind such films as the disturbing
classic&quot;Se7en&quot; and the quirky and unusual &quot;The Game&quot; and other titles
such as &quot;Panic Room&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot;. In this movie Fincher again he
tells us how each character acts within the first scene we see them in,
but they change and adapt to what has been brought upon them and it can
either lead to good or bad. Even though Fincher was not the writer of
this movie he did write a lot of new stuff for this movie and actually
made entirely new scenes to go in with the movie.<br /><br />I own all of Finchers movies I the Special Edition version, except for
&quot;The Game&quot; but I don't think they one for it yet. My favorite of all of
his movies is &quot;Fight Club&quot; but the special features are kind of bad,
now &quot;Se7en&quot; has good features, but I would still buy the special &quot;Fight
Club&quot; because it is a collectors item and its worth owning.<br /><br />10/10
