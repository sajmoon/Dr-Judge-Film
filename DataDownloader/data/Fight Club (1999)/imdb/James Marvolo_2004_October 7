This movie is one of the best folks. I happen to be listening to the
soundtrack as I am writing this write now, and I'll probably be
listening to every time you read this, no matter who you are. This movie
is an astounding leap out of the box of average movies. The violence
and the sex are of course there, but fade into nothingness when matched
with the creative genius of Chuck Palahniuk's story. The sheer
complexity of the characters and their interactions is something rare
to find in most movies. In closing, it is definitely a MUST-SEE movie
for everyone. Not to be watched at a young age, but OK for your
mid-teen and up. If they/you can handle it, you decide. And don't
forget Chuck Palahniuk, the brain behind it all. It was HIS book after
all. Chuck, we all owe you forever.<br /><br />&quot;You have to give up.&quot;
