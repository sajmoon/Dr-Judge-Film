1999_December 29 

definitely the best film *i've* seen 1999!<br /><br />i saw it when it opened up here in malm&ouml; (se) on december 25th, and since i
rarely go to the cinema and even more seldom on opening nights, i have to
admit it was a deliberate choice. i did not want to get influenced or hear
about the movie from other people - it often destroys the
experience.<br /><br />however did one friend manage to get through to me and tell me about the
film before i went (since sweden probably was one of the last countries it
opened up in) and he said &quot;excellent&quot; so i tried to keep my expectations
low...<br /><br />it was not nearly as violent and bloody as i'd expected, nor was it as
abusive or offensive or over-all as revolting as i'd read. but, when you
hear it you expect a lot and let's face it, today it takes a *lot* of
violence and disgusting effects to surpass reality. i did *not* expect all
the funny and humorous remarks and comments and laughed heartily at each
and
every one of them.<br /><br />from minute one until minute onehundredandforty (i wonder which minute
they've cut out from for example the americans?), i was stuck to my seat,
only my fingers moving as i tapped at the pace of the beats of the music
(what an ace soundtrack as well, now that's what i call film-music!) and i
was unable to speak or think when my brain and senses fought to imbibe what
was going on up on the screen.<br /><br />apart from the ending (which *i* think could have been a bit more polished
and perhaps made out to be more of a twist) i am in awe.<br /><br />all actors did super becoming their characters, special kudos to ED NORTON
(of course!) BRAD PITT (of course II!) and HELENA BONHAM CARTER (of course
III!) - so refreshing to see HBC in something so different from the british
costume movies.<br /><br />slick filming, slick performances, slick music and as i said at first - the
best movie i've seen in '99. don't think it would go all the way to win an
oscar for best movie, but that doesn't mean that i don't think it deserves
it.<br /><br />and for those who say that it might start off / increase violence amongst
youngsters and gangs and such - you better go see it again 'cause that's
not
what this film is about.<br /><br />as soon as i left the cinema i wanted to go straight back in and see it
again, and i will go see it again. am certain i'll find even more hidden
under the layers.<br /><br />and oh, this is definitely a film for those of us who wants to get the
brain
activity to rise - not just during the film but also afterwards when we
think about the film.<br /><br />i encourage women to go see this film - it's not about men but about the
society and about our lives.<br /><br />quoting tyler durden:
&quot;It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do
anything.&quot;<br /><br />SEE IT. DAMMIT!
