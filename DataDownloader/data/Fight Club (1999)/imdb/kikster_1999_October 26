1999_October 26 

WOW! I anticipated the opening of Fight Club for several months, mainly for
the superficial reason of seeing Jared Leto on the big screen, that's my
true confession...however, I was bowled over, blown away and left
physically
shaken by this powerful flick! I was captivated from frame one and never
blinked until the final credits...what a brilliant work, masterfully
written, acted, shot, edited--it's all good!! Lucky enough to see a sneak
preview the night before the movie actually opened, I was a bit
apprehensive
about the violence--I typically don't see films that are laden with
excessive violence but, this form of violence in it's most primal form was
not offensive to me! The only film that came to mind as I watched Fight
Club
was A Clockwork Orange (much more disturbing to me) but this one takes you
so much further...all the next day the images were still etched in my mind
or on my eyes, I felt like I was looking through them as I went about my
day...brilliant social commetary, great acting, and interesting twists that
are at once foreign to us yet hit so close to home!! see it now! :)
