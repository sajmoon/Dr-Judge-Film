What can I say about Fight Club? This movie is the best movie I watched in
1999, and that's saying a lot. I personally thought that 1999 was the best
year for movies to come along in a long time. I don't have any complaints
about this movie. The acting was great, the directing was great, the
writing
was great and the production for this movie was nothing less than great. I
didn't even think I was going to like it at all because the commercials
didn't do the movie justice. But I went to see it anyways. I'm glad I did
because it turned out to be way better than I could have expected. Edward
Norton hasn't disappointed me yet and if all of his movies turn out to be
as
good as they have been so far, I think he has one hell of a career ahead of
him. Go see this movie. After that, go see it again. When your done with
that, go buy it on video and DVD and watch it two more times. Trust me on
this one.
