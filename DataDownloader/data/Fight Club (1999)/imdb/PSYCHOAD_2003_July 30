2003_July 30 

the film starts off with narrator (norton) who tells you about tyler
durnen
he meets him and they start a underground fight club which soon goes all
the
country and they start to blow things up and start to become terriosts
they
are going to blow some building down town. it was a good film but it is a
tad
bit overrated at number 39 should be at 130 or something some people like
it
better then i would not say a masterpeice but good 8/10
