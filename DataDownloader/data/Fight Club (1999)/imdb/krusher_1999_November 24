&quot;You do not talk about fight club!&quot;. I walked out of the movie theater a
different man with a new view on how to make a good film that can really
capture your mind. This film is absolutely brilliant! Edward Norris is one
of the best young actors in America right now, and he will improve. I don&acute;t
want to write about the plot of the movie Fight Club, because I would
probably spoil it for the others who haven&acute;t seen it. So I recommend
everyone who have not seen it to take a couple of hours of their IKEA life
and see it!!! It&acute;s worth it. My little
white-collar-boring-to-death-perspective on life has changed a little since
I saw it. Even if you are a Brad Pitt-hater, go and see it. I was before I
saw Fight Club, but today I am reborn Brad Pitt-lover.
