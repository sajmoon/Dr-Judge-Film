Close your eyes for the fist fights if you must (there's not as many as you
probably think). This film is not about guys knocking each other around.
Norton is fantastic and Pitt shows some great chops (acting, not karate). 
Fincher makes films you just can't look away from even when what's on the
screen makes you flinch. A great movie!
