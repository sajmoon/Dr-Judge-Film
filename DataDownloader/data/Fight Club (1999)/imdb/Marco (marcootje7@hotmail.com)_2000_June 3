I saw this recently on tape and I liked it very much.
Like The sixth sense it had a &quot;neat&quot; twist. But this one I didn't
expect.
The ending is somewhat inconclusive and a bit unsatisfying.
But as a whole it is a great film. Fincher is a man with a vision. He is
inventive and creative.
Norton is good, but the movie belongs to Pitt. I think this guy willbecome
an even greater actor than Norton. The problem is: he is too goodlooking.
But he showed it in Seven and now in this movie: the guy can
act.
Fight club is violent, yes. But is it exploitive? No. Never is hate, crime,
power or money a reason for it. It shows that self-inflicted pain can be
healing. It can give solace.
Growth by selfdestruction is the theme. Modern society has never been
satirized the viciously. 
A unique, very underrated movie that will be hailed as a masterpiece in ten
years.<br /><br />
