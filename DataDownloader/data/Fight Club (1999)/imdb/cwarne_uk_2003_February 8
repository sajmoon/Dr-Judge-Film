For two-thirds of it's length this film offers some of the most bracing
black comedy ever to emerge from Hollywood. Unfortunately the resolution of
it all as some kind of apocalyptic thriller is pathetic and forces a
downward re-evaluation of what has passed before. As with &quot;Se7en&quot; David
Fincher shows an inability to get through a film without resorting to
cliche. Although this sounds negative I would still applaud the ambitions,
although worryingly &quot;Panic Room&quot; leads one to believe that this represents
an end rather than a beginning.
