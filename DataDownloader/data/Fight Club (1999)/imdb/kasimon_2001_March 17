Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter shine in &quot;Fight Club,&quot;
David Fincher's brilliant social satire.  It is amazing how this film was
overlooked for major Oscar consideration because of its outstanding writing,
over-the-top acting performances, and riveting underground cinematography. 
One of the best films of 1999; 10 out of 10 stars.
