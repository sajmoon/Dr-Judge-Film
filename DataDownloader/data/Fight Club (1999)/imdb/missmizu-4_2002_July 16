Awesome. Norton and Pitt were amazing as individual characters and as an
onscreen duo. I'm quite surprise that it would be so hilarious. The trailer
definitely did not do it justice. It is more than just violence; it has a
point, though it did go to extreme to illustrate that point. It takes a stab
at commercialism and the mundane, materialism and the hollow spirits, and
more. You won't regret viewing it, though it may require that you have a
sense of humour and an open mind. I don't know what to think about the
ending, but it is quite amusing and surprising. Highly
recommended.
