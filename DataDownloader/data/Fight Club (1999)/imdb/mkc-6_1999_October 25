Great movie!  Same theme as has been prevalent in Fincher's last two films
-- Seven and The Game.  Same message as American Beauty, told, obviously,
in
a completely different way.  Saw it three times.  My teenage daughters saw
it twice and want to see it again.  Their male friends saw it with them and
also loved it.  Very socially responsible.  A good wake-up
call.
