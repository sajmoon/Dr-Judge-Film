This may be one of the nineties best movies. Fight Club is an outstandingly
written, directed and acted movie, which will force anyone who sees it to
take a harder line in self-examination. Edward Norton gives an outstanding
performance as the Narrator (wrongly billed as &quot;Jack&quot; by some, Jack is the
name of the character in the book he reads)Pitt provides some cracking
fireworks as Tyler Durden, the man who turns the narrator's life
upside-down. This is everything a good movie should be, funny, intelligent,
and very, very quoteable.<br /><br />Best Bit: &quot;For your homework, you will start a fight and lose&quot; - leading to
the funniest recruitment scene in history.
