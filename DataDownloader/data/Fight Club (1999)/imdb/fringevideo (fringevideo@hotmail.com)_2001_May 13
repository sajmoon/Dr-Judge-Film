Directed by David Fincher, Fight Club is a very weird movie that people
either loved or hated. It is a dark; very satiric, and incredibly funny
movie. Our star played by Edward Norton [American History X (1998)], on one
of his many business trips, meets Tyler Durden played Brad Pitt [Kalifornia
(1993) / Seven (1995, also directed by David Fincher)], a sly soap-salesman
and jack-of-all-trades. When Edward Norton's high rise apartment is
mysteriously firebombed, he turns to Brad Pitt for help. After a few drinks,
both learn that neither has ever been in a fight. Pitt asks Norton to punch
him. The 'Fight Club' is born. Channeling primal male aggression into a
shocking new form of therapy the concept catches on, with underground 'Fight
Clubs' forming in every town. Becoming a weekly testosterone social event,
the club soon begins to grow, then mutate into a terrorist organization
known as 'Project Mayhem'. A nihilistic cult that subverts and disrupt
society whenever possible, through pranks and anti-corporate aggression.
Throughout the film director David Fincher uses stylized subliminal editing,
exciting camerawork, and digital effects to make a his work come to life.
The film ends with a surprise ending similar to The Sixth Sense (1999), when
Norton realizes that he is having a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; .......
The DVD is full of so many extras
that they needed a second disc fit them all on.
