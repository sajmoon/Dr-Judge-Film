I think people take this movie too seriously sometimes. Yes, Fight Club has
some powerful messages about culture, society, work, identity, and
abandonment. However, if you strip it all away - fight club is merely a
simple tale about a guy finding himself. The look and feel of this movie is
astounding. Every scene and movement has a Kubrick level of sophistication. <br /><br />Fight Club is not for everybody. It also demands something of its audience.
It is best to view this movie as a whole rather than its parts. Each part is
weak in some way, but as a whole there is a powerful, visually stunning
message that is not terribly complex, but still very intriguing.
