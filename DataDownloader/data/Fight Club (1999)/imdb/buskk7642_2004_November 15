This is quite simply one of the geatest films ever made and it
completely blew me away. This is the Citizen Kane of our day. every
aspect of the film is dedicated to the singular point of the film.<br /><br />It's absolutely intoxicating and covers capitalism, conformity, false
prophets and the search for something true.<br /><br />You really need to see this film more than once to appreciate it's
brilliance. I suggest that everyone should see it and discuss with
their friends. have a movie night, a few beers, few friends and a great
movie. Afterwards talk about the point of the film and share your
opinions.
