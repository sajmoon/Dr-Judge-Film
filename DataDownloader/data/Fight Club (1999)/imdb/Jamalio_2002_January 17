Edward Norton plays Jack, a man who has been pushed over the edge by a
mundane job, a mundane life, and a mundane world. His mundane job is a car
sales rep, which means he has to travel from place to place on &#145;single
serving' flights to distribute his (anonymous) car company, which is
revealed to have more than a couple of corrupted tricks up their sleeve in
an attempt to boost their over inflated salaries. Jack, who appears as a man
smart enough to realise the emotionally unrewarding life he has entailed,
attends self help groups as an attempt at catharsis, in which he gradually
encounters Marla Singer (a cast against type Helena Bonham Carter) at groups
that specialise in the emotional recovery of Testicular Cancer (she has no
right to be there, but  then again, neither does he) as the depression he
suffers from this mundane lifestyle causes him to suffer great depression
which results in insomnia. He then meets the charismatic Tyler Durden
(played with real grittiness by Brad Pitt, who revels himself in the films'
subject matter) and Jacks' condo, on his return, is (mysteriousley) blown to
pieces. He calls Tyler for a place to stay, the two develop a strange bond
with a fisticuffs match, and- deciding how therapeutic it has proved for
them, decide to organise an underground &#145;fight club' in which men forget
about their emotional pain by experiencing it in the physical sense. But
loss of physical control leads to loss of mental control, and the group soon
becomes an all out product of destructive vandalism as they attack big,
corporate money makers that distort the purity of a good honest lifestyle
with &#145;this is how you should live' ideals- which they promote shamelessly to
fulfill their own sense of greed (similar to Jacks' position as a car rep)
that were responcible for contributing to Jacks' isolation and depression in
the first place and from his natural instincts and masculinity.<br /><br />To say that Fight Club is a Taxi Driver of these times is a fitting
comparison yet is also a disregard for its' unique, subversive power. It is
a film that is every bit a study on how men have lost their sense of
masculinity as materialistic society deprives them of their primal instincts
by blurring the line that seperates men from the materialistic desires of
the average (and idealistic) woman. As such, it is quite simply a mans' film
(girls who claim to like it probably only do so because it stars Brad Pitt)
as it has a degrading perspective towards women- Marla Singer is treated as
a rough sex object that obscures Jacks' recovery from his rebirth as a &#145;real
man'.  What prevents this film from being an offensive assault on the senses
is it's stream of black comedy that buries itself beneath the chaos and
disorder like a creeping disease- a fittingly ironic &#145;happy ending' sums the
film up perfectly, and the twist, although at first incomprehensible, sums
up the conditions of modern life's attributes of destroying a mans ethics;
existential confusion of moral masculine instincts and self identity quite
brilliantly 10/10.
