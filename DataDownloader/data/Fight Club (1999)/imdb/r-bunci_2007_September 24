The film is good, but not excellent. What is excellent is Edward
Norton&#39;s performance. He&#39;s a very good actor, and in this film, he just
did it again. I&#39;m not really convinced about Pitt&#39;s acting. I don&#39;t
know if the director&#39;s intentions with Pitt was to show his famous
muscles. This movie was not about to be the sequel of Troy! While
Norton captivated the attention running with ridiculous underwear and a
beaten face, Pitt appeared to be a god with a perfect body and with a
not very beaten face, given the circumstances. It seems that the
leading role was assigned to Pitt, but Norton is the one who deserves
it. But it&#39;s a very interesting film.
