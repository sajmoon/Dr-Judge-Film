I gathered from some sources that this is one of the movies that people
like. So I rented it, watched it.<br /><br />It begins with a man narrating his story with some witty lines, but in
a very monotonous voice. The movie starts with this man having a life
which follows a set routine. However, soon it turns out that this life
turns into a whole journey of unconventional and out of the ordinary
events, and a wild life which this man seems to like better. However,
too many things happen and that gives an effect of a missing flow in
the movie.<br /><br />The major twist that comes at the end is unbelievable. Don&#39;t get me
wrong, I don&#39;t mean that it is unbelievably good. I just mean that -
unbelievable. It is like after having done with the whole movie, they
had to put some twist - so they put something totally bizarre. And that
leaves the movie with lots of holes. It does not explain, for example
how the narrator knows how to make bombs, or soap for that matter.<br /><br />And god only knows, why all those men were following Brad Pitt&#39;s
vandalism team (I say vandalism team, but it has been referred to as a
terrorism group in the movie. You judge.) Was the team imaginary too?<br /><br />Also I never found the reason why they would like to flash a picture of
a man&#39;s penis once or twice in the middle of the movie. The fact that
it doesn&#39;t serve any purpose makes it one more reason to make the movie
distasteful for me.<br /><br />The conclusion of this movie seemed to me as a very pathetic attempt to
create a twist. In my opinion, even if they had a conclusion like one
of the characters was an alien from another planet, that would still
have been more interesting and more realistic than this amateur
&#39;twist&#39;. Not sure which part of the movie is exactly so good that some
people have given it a &#39;cult&#39; status.<br /><br />If you like this, then perhaps you haven&#39;t seen A Beautiful Mind, or
The Sixth Sense yet. They will blow you off.
