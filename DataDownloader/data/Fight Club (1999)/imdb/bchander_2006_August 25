Take away Pitt&#39;s perfect physique... This film enables the viewer to
submerge into an ocean of cynicism and desperation. If you find it
irresistibly trendy to let go of any hope or optimism, preferring to
celebrate disappointment with the no-show &quot;perfect world&quot; some idiot
parent promised you, and wallow in self-pity presented with a facade of
fashionable violence, then this film is for you. Knock yourself out.
I&#39;d stop now if IMDb didn&#39;t require a longer review... Production
quality, acting, editing, etc. for this film is all first-rate
Hollywood. First-rate Hollywood...now that&#39;s a good thing, right? Hope
you enjoyed this alternative to all the wondrous reviews &quot;Baseball
Bat&quot;...I mean &quot;Fight Club&quot; has received.
