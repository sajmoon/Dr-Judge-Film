Even though it was the weirdest movie I have ever seen, it is one the best.
It is just mind-boggling!  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should,
unless you have a weak stomach.  I don't see why it was snubbed by the
Oscars.  The title makes it seem like it is just a movie about fighting and
then when you get around the ending, BAM! it takes you by surprise!  I have
heard that people could easily predict the ending, but I highly doubt it!
If you liked the surprise ending that Sixth Sense had, this movie might
have
the same effect or even a greater effect on you.  In my opinion it was
better than Sixth Sense.
