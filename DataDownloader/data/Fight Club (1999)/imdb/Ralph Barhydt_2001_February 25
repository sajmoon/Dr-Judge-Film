The message in this movie is one of pain and isolation.  It is a surprising
critique on modern society and a different approach to the alienation
between son and father.  It is exceptionally well done and that is part of
its uncomfortable nature.  I have tried to watch it again two or three
times, but find it almost impossible to watch due to the slow pace and
dwelling on the absurd.
