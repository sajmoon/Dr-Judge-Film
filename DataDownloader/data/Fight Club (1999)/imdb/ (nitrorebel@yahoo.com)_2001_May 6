Fight Club is easily one of the best films of the past decade. Similar to
Taxi Driver or A Clockwork Orange, its reception has been mixed and
ambiguous. Like its two illustrious predecessors, though, its portrait of
society is spot-on.<br /><br />This is especially true for its poignant satire of the all-pervasive jock
mentality in the US. By showing the disillusionment and inferiority
complexes of men, it initially seems to bow to the generic macho response:
denigrate women by &quot;hanging with the boys&quot; and finding oneself in brainless
fascism. That's how Hitler recruited youths for the SS and SA, and that's
how the WWF and MTV &quot;recruit&quot; its viewership.
Yet its twist at the end turns the film into an ambiguous, postmodern
criticism of its previous 120 minutes. Refusing to be typecast, Fight Club
ends with a melodramatic anti-climax that leaves the viewer in a daze as to
the film's exact meaning.<br /><br />As most people will tell you, the film's true essence only becomes apparent
after a second viewing since one's innocence of the narrative has been
lifted. Besides the amazing relevance of its content, be warned of the
barrage of subliminal Tylers (can you spot them?) and penises, which
together with the hilarious scene where Ed Norton shows Tyler's editing
handiwork add to the self-parody of filmmaking in general and the film
itself in particular.<br /><br />Be further warned of the aggressive criticism of today's male reactionism.
While some have viewed the depiction of fighting as a literal expose of
fascist ideology, the film actually denounces the violence it represents,
although it does so in a more intellectual and subliminal way than people
might be comfortable with.<br /><br />Gary Crowdus' summary of this masterpiece may also be its most accurate
appraisal: &quot;The first film of the 21st century.&quot; Ambiguous?!
