Fight Club.  A fascinating film!  David Fincher really out did himself
this
time!  Fincher is a superb director!  His films, Fight Club, Seven, The
Game
and whatever comes next are all decisive brillant films!  His work is
never
ignored and never put down like a mindless movie is.  People love his
films
and people hate his films.  The thing is, people never ignore his work.
People don't shrug it off as some mindless dribble that they don't care to
have an opinion on like most films these days.  If they hate his films,
they
have a strong reason and opinion on why they hate them.  If they love
them,
they have a strong opinion on why they love them.  Like I said, no one
shruggs them off as not.  Decisive his films are!  Decisive and strong
opinionated Fight Club is!  Majorly(sp?) atmospheric and strange yet
compelling and never dull or uninteresting!  Fincher knows what he's doing
in filmaking.  I say he'll go down as one of the greatest filmakers of our
time!  He'll deserve it too!  Fight Club is a great story!  Probably the
best story I've ever seen or read!  Fincher took Palahniuks deep character
descriptiveness &amp; applied it to film perfectly!  He deserves, hands down,
a
best director Academy Award for this brillant work!  Fight Club is a film
that is not ignored.
