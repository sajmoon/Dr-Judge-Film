Thanks to this movie. Its my favorite movie. I like the idea of the
story. Its a work of a genius. If the club exist, i will gladly join in
and invite others too. I recommend people to watch this movie and think
of life, society and the morals. At middle age, are we happy? What are
we doing? For what are we?<br /><br />I&#39;ve made my own fight club (its been a year already). It started with
the construction workers, then to the security guards and the mobs. Now
its spreading to the factory workers and slowly to the professionals. I
have also made a sign as a gesture of the group (2 twisting fist). Its
like a virus, a chimera monster.<br /><br />Hope to see a sequel of the movie.
