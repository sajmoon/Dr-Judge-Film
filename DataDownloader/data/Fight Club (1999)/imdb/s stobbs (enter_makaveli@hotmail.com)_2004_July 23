I am extremely late commenting on this movie...I first seen it when it
came out in the theater, later went on to buy it and have since seen it
hundreds of times. I know that it generates a mixed reaction, but its
my favorite movie for so many different reasons. It kicks ass on
various levels and it has action, drama, suspense and lots of twists
and turns along with some dark comedy. It has some great ideas which
make you think about things and open your eyes, especially to our
society and world today, and mainly, consumerism. <br /><br />My opinion may be biased as Edward Norton is also my favorite actor,
but Brad Pitt does a fantastic job in it too, as well as the rest of
the supporting cast. If for some reason, someone reading this has not
seen the movie yet, go watch that s**t already! Best movie ever, or at
least a really great one.
