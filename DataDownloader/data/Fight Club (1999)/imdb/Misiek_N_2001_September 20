ANARCHY! that is the best way to describe this movie. I loved it the first
time I saw it and after seeing it more than a dozen times, I can easily
admit that this is definitely one of my favourites, not to mention most
important movies. It shows what modern life culture and trends/society does
to the human psyche. Fight Club is also a very brave movie- it shows the
little anarchist that is dwelling in all of us-it is brave because I guess
that 99% of people deny that fact-the fact that sometimes you have an urge
to destroy(&quot;I felt like destroying something beautiful&quot;),but instead of
letting it out people keep the tension building up inside them since they
know &quot;letting go&quot; would not be approved by modern day society,and therefore
the  stress factor keeps on growing untill....-heh,just see the
movie-....All I have to say is THANK YOU DAVID FINCHER FOR THIS BRAVE AND
BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE!!!! Next to the classic Easy Rider this is my second
most important movie.
