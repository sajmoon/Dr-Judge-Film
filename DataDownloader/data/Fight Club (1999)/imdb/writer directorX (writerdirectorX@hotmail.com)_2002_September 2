In watching the DVD version of `Fight Club' with the commentary `on' I was
astounded to learn that the creators of the film thought it would be seen
as
a comedy.  They hid behind the thin veil of the term `Dark Comedy' which I
personally define as: `A comedy that isn't funny, but if you say it isn't
then 'smart' people will frown at you.' During the commentary Edward
Norton
says something to the effect of `only those people with no senses of humor
will think this film isn't a comedy.' Well, Edward, I'm a Comedy
writer/director and I'm here to tell you, you and your cohorts have not
created a comedy.  What clearly happened on the set of `Fight Club' has
happened on many sets that I've been apart of, that is, a small group of
people got together and agreed upon some `creative vision' and then forgot
that it was their JOB to transfer that vision to the audience.  I can
imagine the discussions: `This is too campy, we should play it straight; I
heard that the best comedy is played dramatically. etc. etc. etc.'  Or
something like it.  This was clearly a case of `group dynamic', the same
impulse that allows `gangs' of people to commit acts that no individual
would do on their own.  It is the story teller's FIRST job and (in my
opinion) ONLY job to translate the story to an audience that DOES NOT have
the benefit of knowing your twist ending OR your `inside jokes'.  `Fight
Club', while clearly being played tongue in cheek in many scenes, forgot
that its subject matter (the decline of modern society to commercialism
and
the generation of `lost souls' it created) was far too serious a subject
matter to be EXPECTED to be seen as funny by the mass viewing audience.
Add
to that the very violent fight scenes, and `humor' is NOT the first word
that comes to mind.  It is ironic to me that the director of this film
would
often misquote Buddhist doctrines to the cast while creating a film with a
huge Karmic debt (I have personally witnessed a group of teenage boys
creating their own `Fight Club' on the front lawn next door to mine).  All
this being said, this story (and yes this film) is a VERY excellent one.
I
was very impressed by the film on the first viewing, though the first
thing
I said to my wife during the end credits was `You know, there will be
groups
of teenage boys creating 'Fight Clubs' across America.' (How ironic I was
vindicated months later by what I stated earlier.).   Overall, this was a
cinematic masterpiece, but maybe the bulk of the praise should go to the
original author.  One useful byproduct of the `group think' it seems was
that having the actors think the entire film was a `lark' was actually
useful for Brad Pitt's character, who, felt that way about life anyway (an
interesting Director's tool I've seen used purposely and for great effect
by
the way, that of misdirecting an actor's understanding of the `message' of
the film so that they play their character more accurately).  All this
being
said, I think the film is one of the best to come around in many years and
deserves a deep and repeated viewing by film lovers everywhere. Lastly, a
quick hat's off to Arnon Milchan for producing another breathtaking and
edgy
film (like `Brazil' and and MANY other controversial and challenging films
[check out his credits to see what I mean]).
