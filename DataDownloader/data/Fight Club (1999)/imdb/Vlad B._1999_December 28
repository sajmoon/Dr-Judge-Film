Is &quot;Fight Club&quot; an endorsement of faschism and violence, or merely a
cautionary tale? None of the above. David Fincher's controversial fourth
feature is simply put, one big joke, that the unsuspecting audience is
subjected to, under the pretense of criticizing modern consumerism and
materialism, as well as mourning the loss of true masculinity by today's
y-chromosome bearers. Edward Norton, a renegade corporate slave, and Brad
Pitt, a flamboyant, mysterious rebel, organize a cult-like establishment
where men can turn to for venting of their innate aggression. Before long,
the aggression is redirected toward the rest of the world.  The film spews
much venom aimed, it seems, at human life in general, occasionally hitting
the right spots, provoking the viewer to sport a wicked grin or two, but no
more. Fincher's penchant for nihilism does not leave room for any other
feelings when viewing these frequently pointless displays of brutality. In
the end, especially in the light of the twisted, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;-inspired
parallel ending which only strengthens the &quot;joke effect&quot;, one gets the
impression that the movie is trying to meddle in too many genres at once,
while not being powerful or engaging enough to stand outside genre
boundaries.
