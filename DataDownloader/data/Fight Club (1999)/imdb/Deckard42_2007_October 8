Long ago I saw Fight Club for the first time. Back then it was so
precisely showing all that I felt about modern society, and a lot more,
it just seemed like a divine revelation. I can hardly say how much and
what it gave to me, but the closest word to describe it would be
&quot;hope&quot;.<br /><br />Usually as time goes by, your point of few changes, you get into other
roles in life and tend to distance yourself from turbulent times in the
past. But looking back today, I have to realize, that although many
things have changed, Fight Club is still what it was:<br /><br />Not only can I still identify with its extreme criticism, not only is
it still a uniquely deep and perfectly done movie, it still stands all
alone, more alone then ever perhaps, with all it has said. Brad Pitt
playing Tyler Durden has remained one of the best performances ever
given - just like Edward Norton as anonymous main character of the
movie. Norton portraying the &quot;normal&quot;, sick life standard of modern
societies, contrasting himself to and finding himself in Tyler Durden,
the anarchistic mythical creature living in and from the idea of the
portrayed life standard itself. (think of the plot at this point)<br /><br />The movie&#39;s portrayal of our lifes is at least a strong call for
realism towards our roles in a capitalistic world, which - in the terms
of globalization for example - has never seemed more unheard. And this
is exactly what makes Fight Club&#39;s devastating, anarchistic point of
few so highly legitimate. In the end everything is subject of
interpretation, as this subversive masterpiece has put every piece of
even itself into a context highly ambivalent - consciously avoiding any
constructive criticism.<br /><br />Many have associated this movie with a Generation of people identifying
with it. Looking back many years later, this is still true - with one
addition: It is clearly going to be more then one generation.
