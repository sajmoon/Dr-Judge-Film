This is a film everyone has to see. I cant believe the Academy didn&#39;t
throw Oscars its way upon viewing it, they gave &#39;Return of the King&#39; 13
for Christ&#39;s sake. This film is wonderfully intellectual, thrilling and
immensely funny. The only bad thing i can say about it is that the
theme is a little fore fed through the dialogue but hey, you&#39;re
thinking about the plot so much that it&#39;s almost necessary. Norton
gives the us the performance of his career and Pitt delivers, with awe
inspiring calm, one of the coolest characters (the coolest imaginary
one) ever to smash onto the screen. This movie really does have it all.
Great plot, fantastic characters and a clever theme. If you haven&#39;t
seen it, watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again.
