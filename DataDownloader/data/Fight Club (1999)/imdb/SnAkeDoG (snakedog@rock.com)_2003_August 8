David fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is truly entertaining. Not for the light of
heart, this dark comedy takes you for a wild twisting turning ride that
leaves you wanting more. &quot;Fight Club&quot; features an excellant soundtrack by
the dust brothers. Edward Norton's performance was amazing, but hey what
Edward Norton performance isn't? Brad pitt did his usual Brad Pitt style.
And Helena Bonham Carter hit the bullseye with her white trashy portrayle
of
Marla. This film takes a stab at soicity with its anti corperate message.
All in all &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a must see film if you are a fan of the Black
Comedy genre.
