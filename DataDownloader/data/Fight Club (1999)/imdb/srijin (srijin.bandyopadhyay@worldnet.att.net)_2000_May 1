The first rule of Fight Club: think long and hard after you see Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club: think even more about the movie until you
arrive at the truth and power of this masterpiece. Finally, if you believe
that you've been able to ascertain the greatness of Fight Club, then you
are
ready to read the following commentary.<br /><br />Fight Club is the iconoclast of movies. It is a brilliant,
stream-of-consciousness picture packed with phenomenal directing, fresh
applications of visual effects, and a duo of characters that will stick in
your mind because of their blatant realism. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are
simply awesome. Pitt plays an anarchistic, free-willed character named
Tyler
Durden who serves as a contrast to the unassuming insomniac Jack, played by
Norton. Pitt is what we could only hope to be, whereas Norton is a
pathetic,
suffering human being whose life is lost and devoured by a society of
consumerism.<br /><br />The reason Fight Club is so controversial is because of its truthful,
explosive nature. Whereas movies such as American Beauty are friendly and
clever to the average viewer, FC is much more captivating and daring. It is
an intrepid ride through the reality we often prefer to deny. FC presents
all the drawbacks we don't wish to hear about of our supposedly &quot;advanced&quot;
society. FC is not about beating others to a bloody pulp, but it focuses
upon liberating oneself and having the courage to go with your aspirations
and dreams - instead of drowning in a world of conventions and materialism.
Ikea, Starbucks, and Martha Stewart are the enemies, and are brilliantly
derided by a movie dripping with social parodies. Fight Club is also the
paradigm of David Fincher's movies: the dark humor will keep you laughing
for weeks.<br /><br />Although accused of making fun of people with testicular cancer along with
promoting violence, David Fincher's Fight Club clearly applies these
aspects
of life as integral elements of a potent theme. Testicular cancer is
significant in showing how a person much derive motivation from watching
others suffer, in order to eventually rejuvenate himself. Violence is used
to show a brotherhood of liberated proletariats, but the violence
eventually
goes out of control and progresses towards terrorism. Overall, FC is a
movie
about the mind, and focuses on the dangerous repercussions of self-denial,
consumerism, and suppressed dreams.<br /><br />From a directing point of view, FC is a masterpiece. Directed by David
Fincher (Se7en, The Game), FC revolutionizes the use of visual effects, has
great music (the soundtrack by The Dust Brothers is great), and applies a
stream-of-consciousness method of narration that is prominently unique. In
retrospect, Fincher is brilliant, FC as a whole is powerful, and the movie
is a must-see for those willing to be thought-provoked.
