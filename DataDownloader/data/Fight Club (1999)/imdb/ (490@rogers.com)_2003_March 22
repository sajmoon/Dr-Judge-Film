...but I mean that in a good way.
All films have flaws...so I guess you can't call this a film, because
Fight
Club is, for lack of a better word, perfect.
The plot is beautifully played out; the acting and directing is
incredible;
the movie pulls you in and doesn't let go...ever.<br /><br />If you can stomach the violence and the social element, Fight Club is for
you. If you can't, watch it anyway. No matter how much you'd like to
believe
you're a sensitive viewer, you won't be able to turn away.<br /><br />It's hard to fully capture this movie is words, so I'll just say this:
watch
it. If you consider yourself a true fan of movies, buy it,
period.
On a scale from 1 to 10, Fight Club gets an 11.
