Fight Club is probably one of the most frantic movies ever made. Right from
the opening credits, the extremely competent direction of David Fincher
smashes the viewer with his bloody violence and fast paced camera
angles.<br /><br />The acting is superb, Brad Pitt's twisted portrayal of Tyler Durden was
great, and almost over shadowed Edward Norton role as the unknown character.
Helena Bonham Carter was great and Meatloaf, well.... he was
different.<br /><br />Another brilliant aspect of fight club was the music by the Dust Brothers.
In the scene where the car is racing out of control, the music helps create
the frantic mood. <br /><br />Fight club breaks many rules, but maintains a pace that grabs the viewer and
never let's go.
