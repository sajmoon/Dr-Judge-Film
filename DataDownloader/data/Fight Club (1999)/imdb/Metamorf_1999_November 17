After a rocky start with his feature debut in 'Alien 3', David Fincher is
proving to be a real talent in movieland.  With 'Seven', he showed his
seemingly sudden mastery of the crime thriller.  he may have taken a small
step backward with 'The Game', but with this one, he has taken a huge leap
forward.<br /><br />Satire usually takes one of two forms, humorous (parody) or serious.  This
is BOTH.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give very fine performances as men
disenchanted with the world which has been fashioned for themselves,
prompting them to go about turning it on it's ear.<br /><br />Fincher also gives us some wildly kinetic camera moves and EXTREMELY CLOSE
close-ups that are a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />There's a great plot twist at the start of the third act that came as a
complete surprise to me as did the one in 'The Sixth Sense'.  Now I'm gonna
have to see the film again to look for all the clues that led up to it.<br /><br />Two fists up -- 10/10
