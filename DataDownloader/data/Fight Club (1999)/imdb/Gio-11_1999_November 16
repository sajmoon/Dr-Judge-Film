1999_November 16 

It was great to see true satire up on the screen after all those films
proclaiming themselves as &quot;black comedies&quot; and failing to deliver.  This
movie was brash, acerbic, gritty and caustic - a comment on our white
bread
society and all its &quot;Ikea boys&quot;.  This is arguably the best film to come
out
of a major studio in 1999.  David Fincher is a brave director who plays
with
the iconography of film to reinvent the language of film.  True, the
themes
of alienation and despair are not new but Fincher takes a new slant on
these
problems and delivers a metaphysical, brooding tale on the nature of
existence, death and one's place in the grand scheme of things.  From the
production design to the flawless acting, this is a must see - more than
once to pick up all the movie references and the symbols.  Fincher keeps
reminding us that we are watching a film - at one point he shows us the
sprocket holes - here, the ideas are important to knock us out of our
comfortable seats in the dark.  Brad Pitt delivers as does Edward Norton
who
is fast becoming an actor of discernment and skill.  Helena Bonham-Carter
finally rips her bodice and throws it away to play the vacuous fantasy toy
of the disillusioned male.  I loved this film because it does not give
easy
answers - the Ayn Rand solution rings hollow but Fincher is forcing us to
think out our predicament by an assault on our comfortable viewing
practices
bred by years of films with no vision.
