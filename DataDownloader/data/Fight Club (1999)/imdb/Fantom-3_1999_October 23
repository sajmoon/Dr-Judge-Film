This movie is the most intense, and mesmerizing film you're likely to ever
face.  Compared to Fincher's other work this rate's far more superior to
those movies (that are also very good).  The acting is flawless and the
cinematography will pull every ounce of energy out of you.  Do not miss this
film!!!
