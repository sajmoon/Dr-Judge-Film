This movie is one the best ever. When you are going to see this, it may
confuse you. But that&#x27;s what I really enjoy about this movie. It&#x27;s
confusing in strange ways and makes up many questions but keeps your
mind intense and focused at the same time. It&#x27;s so fascinating.<br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a great combo here. A terrific
match-up. I really like the bewildering intelligence Tyler (Brad Pitt)
uses, to express himself. The Narrator (Edward Norton) develops his
role extremely well too. In addition, the soundtrack of the movie is
really cool.<br /><br />This movie is a must see. It blows you away. A jaw-dropping stuff!
