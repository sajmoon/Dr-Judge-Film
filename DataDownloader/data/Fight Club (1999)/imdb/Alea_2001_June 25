Well, I am not a big movie critic and I can't use big fancy words like
some
of you have, but what I do know is that Fight Club is definitly a very
good
movie. I will admit, it took me two times of watching to totally
understand
this movie, but I think that is a good thing. I now own it and I have
watched it so many times I can't even count. Each time I find something
different and I love that in a movie.<br /><br />One thing I find unbearable in the movie is one small part. I don't like
that part where he is beating the s*** out of Angel Face. I may be a
teenage
girl, but I still think this part is unneccesarily violent. I mean, what
was
the point in grossing us all out? Well, granted, teenage boys and men
think
that's entertainment. I think its a waste of time.<br /><br />I would give this movie an 8 our of 10.
