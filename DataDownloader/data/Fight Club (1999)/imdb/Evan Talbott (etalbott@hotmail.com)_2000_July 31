This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I hate to say that about
something that was just made mere months ago, because it makes me sound
shallow, but it's true. Every single frame is just filled to the brim with
such startling originality that it's like an ultra-violent, philosophical
Being John Malkovich. Not very many films greet you with a man crying into
another man's breasts.<br /><br />All I knew about the film was that it was about a club where men gather to
beat each other into a bloody pulp as a way of perging themselves of that
nasty taste work leaves in their mouths. That's just as well, as the less
you know beforehand, the better. At first I was dissuaded by the opening
credits, which are filled with completely gratuitous CG. This would make
one
think they were about to watch an &quot;MTV style&quot; movie, which I
despise...Armageddon and Natural Born Killers are like what Satan would
make
if given a camera. And then the movie starts, and again I wasn't very
excited...another movie that starts at the end, and thinks it's clever. But
then it REALLY starts, and I was immediately entranced by its world of
social satire and its depiction of materialistic losers. I was a big fan of
American Psycho, and I enjoyed these scenes in much the same way,
especially
the line about how the Narrator would rather look at the IKEA catalog than
porn. Than he falls in with the Fight Club. That is all I'll tell you about
the plot.<br /><br />Back to that style thing...I loved it. It seems like it could get
gratuitous
or overdirected at any minute, but it never quite crosses that boundary. It
stays hyperactive enough to keep you interested, but subdued enough to let
you enjoy what you're watching. Its 2 hours and 20 minutes seem to flash by
in a second, until the ending. It's also VERY violent. The beatings are
extremely brutal, especially the accompaniying sound effects, and there are
two gun shot wounds so gruesome I'd love to know what they bribed the MPAA
with to avoid an NC-17. I wasn't bothered by it, but I'm sure lots of
people
will be.<br /><br />And as for the ending, this is where the film faltered. There's a twist,
yes, but that's not the problem. It's a good twist, like in American
Psycho,
where it actually adds to what's been seen before, rather than films like
The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense, which just tack the endings on to
encourage second viewings (they DO both deserve second viewings, but only
because they're good movies). The problem is the scenes after the surprise
is revealed. Up to this point we've been treated to a film that gives us
something we've never seen before in scene after scene, and then it all
gets
wrapped up with...two normal fights? What happened? There are two battles
here, one physical, one psychological, and they're far too normal to be
here...they belong in a typical action movie. And come on, a bomb
diffusion?
With the &quot;which color wire&quot; scene and everything? Puh-leeze. Save it for a
Van-Damme flick. This was the only point where I started to get
restless.<br /><br />There's a whole anarchistic philosophy behind the film, which I loved. I
didn't buy into it or believe it, mind you, but I loved it...no matter if
you believe in something or not, you have to give credit to someone who can
think it up in the first place. The script is so jam-packed with great
dialogue that this is a film that will be endlessly quotable, like Kevin
Smith doing Nietzsche.<br /><br />Like I said, everything is filled with originality, right up to the final
shot that has a subliminal frame of...well, you'll understand once you find
out about Tyler's hobbies :) See it. Now.
