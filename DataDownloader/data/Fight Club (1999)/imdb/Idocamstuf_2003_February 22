Wow, what boring, repulsive and overrated movie.  I have always kind of
avoided this film because the whole idea sounded kinda stupid, but not only
was it stupid, it was gross and disturbing, I mean the whole seen with the
human fat, just plain disgusting.  Dont even get me started on the ridiculus
plot.  I hated the other Fincher film &quot;The Game&quot; even worse than this one
though, I hope &quot;Se7en&quot; is a giant step above these two movies.   Overall I
think this was the most overrated film of the decade. *1/2 out of
