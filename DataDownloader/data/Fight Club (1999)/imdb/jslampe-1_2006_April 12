In a decade of unoriginality this movie breaks ground in a way that
makes the mind do it&#39;s job. As if the twist and turns weren&#39;t enough,
Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the book) and Jim Uhls (screen play),
create an aura of a motivational dementia. With discipline, a man can
learn a great deal from this movie. It serves as a reminder of just how
crooked the human condition has become, as we strive for perfection
through means of materialism and we look for humanity in commercialism.<br /><br />As for the actors, what can I say!? I feel a real loss of masculenity
when I say Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, but this movie
highlights his excellent acting abilities. Edward Norton, star of
previous movies such as The Rounders, American History X and the
Italian Job, does an amazing job as a complacent unity of society. <br /><br />Watch it NOW!
