A somewhat anti-American message about the lack of need for materialism and
the need to destroy it, with a powder keg. I first put off seeing Fight Club
because of the name, it sounded stupid, and the type of people that were
telling me how great it was weren't exactly those with discerning film
tastes. Shows how much I know. I'm glad I didn't let that prevent me from
seeing this original and thought-provoking film. It's actually not really
even about fighting....it is but it isn't....it's something much more.
Marvelous, simply marvelous.<br /><br />America is a herd of consumers that seek material items they don't really
need for their own personal reasons. Whether it's because of greed,
materialism, or power...it doesn't really matter. The fact of the matter is
that we really don't need them even if we think we do, this is what Fight
Club is really about. Without spoiling anything in the story itself,
Norton's character, an insomniac white collar worker bee, has become
extremely unhappy with his life although he has everything he &quot;needs&quot;. But
does he? Tyler Durden (Pitt) is an interesting stranger who has absolutely
nothing as far as material possessions go, but he does seem much richer. Is
he really? It all gets interesting when the two join together to make a
fight club of sorts to basically feel more alive and see what happens when
they push things to the limit. In comes the mischief and a great
film.<br /><br />Some people seem to despise Brad Pitt but when he's in movies as great as
this one, it makes you wonder if it's just a petty jealousy thing. Yes, he's
good looking, who cares? Is he a pretty boy? By all means. That doesn't
change the fact that he's an excellent actor with excellent film choices.
One of those excellent choices was Fight Club. He plays his psychotic
character with ease and believability. Probably my favorite of all his
roles. Edward Norton is also a perfect choice for the film and delivers yet
another perfect performance. Both actors give flawless performances that
make it impossible to imagine anyone else in their shoes. There's also a
strange screen chemistry between the two that I'd have never
predicted.<br /><br />Some have complained about the violence in FC. Is it violent? Yes. Is it
real? No. If violence in film bothers you, then you're missing out on some
seriously great films, including this one.<br /><br />FC is a truly beautifully shot movie. The cinematography and innovative
scenes come out of nowhere and are extremely entertaining. I'm certain that
I've never seen a film shot quite like this one. Even the opening credits
sequence is quite impressive. It all adds up to one of the most stylish
films in years. Combine that with a truly original and entertaining story
with excellent acting and masterful direction...with a dash of humor, and
you have simply one of the most entertaining films one can watch. Without
giving away anything you may have in store, that is all I will say about
that. <br /><br />It is all but perfect. I would elaborate, but I would not
dare.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
