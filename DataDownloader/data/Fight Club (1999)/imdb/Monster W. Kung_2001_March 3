2001_March 3 

After 1997 and 1998 my hope for seeing a breakthrough in modern cinema, or
at least a stream of really good movies seemed hopelessly doomed. Just like
the narrator of Fight Club, I should have been prepared for a surprise. In
1999 there was Being John Malcovich, American Beauty, the Sixth Sense and
best of all, Fight Club. Too bad the year 2000 saw a lot of the same, old
boring junk come out again.<br /><br />I understand how some people feel repulsed by this movie. Yes, the violence
is graphic, much different from the clean, movie-cut violence from your
standard action movie. Violence has consequences on you... you don't just
get punched in the face and then you're back to normal after 20 minutes.
Yes, it's unsettling, but nothing is gratuitous.<br /><br />Much less I understand how some &quot;big people&quot; deliberately missed the point
by calling this movie dangerous or fascist. The revolution we see in the
movie is much closer to the anarchist sabotages during the 18-hundreds, and
the reasons are the same. They movie doesn't tell you that sabotages are
right, but it shows you the reasons that led to that kind of behaviour.
What
we see here is criticism at our society's faults, and the film hardly
advocates terrorism; yes, unlike American Beauty, it is stretched to
extreme
consequences, and that's exactly the point: we HAVE to avoid a society
ruled
only by capitalism and money, because in such a place we are bound to lose
our soul. You can think of American Beauty a hand that points a finger at
our society's cr*p from the distance, and you can think of Fight Club as a
hand that makes you see the cr*ap by smashing your face in it. And you will
be blown away when you understand that the hand is YOUR
hand.
By the way, am I the only one that sees a parallelism between The Narrator
and Pirandello's One, No One, and One Hundred Thousands? Although the
latter
is less anarchist, both the characters think about who they really are, and
how they've become a tool. Both end up so frustrated they literally lose
their identity.<br /><br />Fight Club deals with problems without being formulaic and preachy. And it
manages it be entertaining, visually incredible, and funny. I can't
recommend this movie to everyone, as I understand some will feel too
unsettled by it (it rocks your world in every possible way). As for me... I
don't think I could ask more from a movie...<br /><br />10/10
