It is nice to say that we are all of the same bio-heap. We come from
nothing and go to nothing. Conclusion? Nothing. I have none of the
material accoutrement&#39;s of a yuppie fight club member. Yes by all means
it is profound to drive crazy and start fights. Another in the
triumvirate of recursive movie-making :- American Psycho, Vanilla Sky
and Fight Club. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;? Was that before or after Amer.
Psycho? Never mind. Nothing matters in a phenomenology. Why not put the
film in a blender and let a computer tape it back together in any
computable random format. {{You see, True randomness is not computable,
it is all an illusion -- DUH.}} Was it a dream or the computer
generated dream of a dream? Which is worst or best matters not because
they are all decomposed by their own colon bacteria. A thriving
constellation of meaningless pop-culture references and &quot;did your hear
that&quot; profundity. If it goes fast it must be profound because it went
fast. And lets not forget the dissing of {{yuppie furniture}} and late
{{corporate rock}} lyrics. This is the plight of my colon bacteria
ending minute by minute. I am {{insert my profile name}}&#39;s belated
vegetarianism. I&#39;ll be having a gyro tonight. Does that include the
flesh of dead mammals? I dunno. But of course I do. Ha Ha. So Surprise
me - Surprise me. It&#39;s cool if said quickly and with earnest pluck of
{{that blond dude from middle America}}. So surprise me (in italics
this time... ) You didn&#39;t get the zen table thing? Yes your frat days
were not for naught they were in fact as profound as the dot com
bubble. {{What are YOU doing here? This is a frat house.}} Just sad the
movie was all a dream. Or is that good it was all a dream? Good-bad.
Bad-good. Your guess is as good as any other space monkey because it&#39;s
all just a spinning blender of our own fat dissolving the grease on our
skin. Add back the lye and you get soap. And back again. Get it now...
Back to the yin-yang table.<br /><br />Conclusion: I thought they might &quot;have something&quot; until the end, when I
realized it was all one big {{large corporate clothing retailer}}
commercial. {{But I knew they were running off the tracks by the &quot;you
wanna be a veterinarian&quot; scene.}}<br /><br />Rating: American Psycho. {{Like Am. Psycho - cannot be viewed twice;
Once you realize that ATMs do not say &quot;insert cat&quot; and semicolons
cannot be inserted in motion pictures.}}<br /><br />But seriously folks the ending REALLY {{vacuum created with ...}}; A
TOTAL COP-OUT... {{and is the reason de etre for this comment}}. <br /><br />If you think &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is deep and profound and not a silly
movie based on a silly book that sounded like a good {{real horrorshow
in me gullava}} idea for a book, then you might like this movie... If I
was a sophomore in college again, then I might too.
