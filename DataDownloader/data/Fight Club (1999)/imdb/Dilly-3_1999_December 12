1999_December 12 

I couldn't get over all the people who came out of this film saying &quot;I
have
to go back and see it a bunch of times in order to get all the subtle
nuances; it's a very deep film.&quot; Ha!<br /><br />UHHHHH, it seems to be saying that consumer culture is bad...  sheesh,
tell
us something we DON'T know! This kind of slick big budget film couldn't
have
been made without the very things it deplores.  I love how so many people
shell out money to be told that they shouldn't be shelling out so much
money.  The producers are laughing all the way to the bank.<br /><br />Misogyny, too! Now THAT's original! It's also homoerotic, but oh, that
would
make it YUCKY, so let's not acknowledge it.<br /><br />Other things:  I admit that there was interesting cinematography and
editing.  But down with annoying voiceovers! Ever so pretentious.  It's
even
worse than in the non-director's cut of Bladerunner. &quot;My blood felt like
BATTERY ACID.&quot; Ooooh, it's so gritty!<br /><br />In order to prevent total discord, however, I have to find some way of
reading this film that allows me to coexist with my friends who liked it,
so
here it is:  A mostly trite flick which has to be viewed as a badly done
satire. Blah.
