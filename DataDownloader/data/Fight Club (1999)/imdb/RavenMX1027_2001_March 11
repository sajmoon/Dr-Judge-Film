Sorry, I just had to do that.  It seems stupid, but hey, the time came and
it was right.<br /><br />Right now, I'm claiming that this was the best movie of 1999, even better
than American Beauty.  Edward Norton is fantastic as an insomniac who
discovers a new form of therapy, known as Fight Club.  Tyler Durden, played
by Brad Pitt, is the creator of Fight Club, and soon this new form of
therapy erupts into a huge club.  And Helena Bonham Carter is the &quot;love
interest&quot;, though she annoys both Norton's and Pitt's characters.<br /><br />The drama is never dull and the acting is on the mark.  Director David
Fincher (Se7en), who shot many musical projects, mixes this movie well with
the very upbeat and techno soundtrack.  What makes this film extremely
interesting is the way Fincher blends the music of the film and Fincher's
use of visual wizardry.<br /><br />Favorite Quote from the Movie:<br /><br />Tyler Durden: First rule of Fight Club, you do not talk about Fight Club.
Second rule of Fight Club, you DO NOT talk about Fight Club. Third rule of
Fight Club, when someone say &quot;stop&quot; or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth
rule of Fight Club, only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule of Fight Club, one
fight at a time. Sixth rule of Fight Club, no shirt, no shoes. Seventh rule
of Fight Club, fights go on as long as they have to. Eighth and final rule
of Fight Club, if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to
fight.<br /><br />Of course, I had to post the 8 rules of Fight Club.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this movie a 10/10.  This movie rocks, so see
it!
