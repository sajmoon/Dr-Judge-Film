Am I the only one who noticed the subliminal hints that Fincher put in
Ie. the one frame flashes of Brad Pitt ...there is one when Edward
Norton is outside his office; another one when he is at the testicular
cancer group (for ONE frame Brad Pitt appears behind the therapist) and
lastly when he is outside of the building Brad Pitt appears, for one
frame only, behind Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) and then of course he
becomes his &quot;Alter Ego&quot; !!!This film was fantastic...sure it was about
fighting and beating the living daylights out of someone but it
explored the way the brain handles stress...ie. first Jack attends the
Addiction meetings and then is able to sleep; but when Marla _&quot;The
Tourist&quot; appears he is back to his old insomnia until he creates his
&quot;alter ego&quot;...and really goes insane and can only get out of it by
getting rid of &quot;himself&quot;... A true masterpiece and Brad Pitt is at his
best!!! Watch for those subliminal one frame flashes and press on
&quot;pause&quot; it's really quite a trick the director pulls on us...because
the first time I watched it I did not see it; then I watched it with my
son who learned about these one frame flashes of Brad Pitt in the movie
The Fight Club...otherwise one just blinks and misses it all together:)
