The movie starts off in a harmless way. Having you believe that it&#39;s
just another frustrated males twisted life story. <br /><br />Half way in to it and I was totally possessed by it&#39;s disturbing
darkness and at the same time the brilliance of it all. <br /><br />I may as well add that fellas with weaker stomach will find it hard to
digest this one.<br /><br />And towards the end a great depression took over me. I felt &#39;There is
no way this one will leave me with anything but depression, what
possibly can happen to alter the course NOW?&#39;. But then, I should have
known better....<br /><br />Having been a great fan of Edward Norton from his &#39;Red Dragon&#39; days, I
know that he has a peculiar taste in selecting films. His movies are
anything but ordinary.<br /><br />The climax of course turned everything up side down and I slipped from
the chair and rolled over...<br /><br />Nothing I say will ever fully describe how I felt. You just GOT TO see
this one. <br /><br />And I never took Brad Pitt seriously before this one, even after
watching se7en. But I have developed a deep sense of respect for this
guy. <br /><br />Teens watch out, if you haven&#39;t seen this one yet then &#39;Tyler Durden&#39;
is gonna blow you over.<br /><br />An amazing movie, fantastic script, superb direction and extraordinary
acting. This one is a collector&#39;s gem.
