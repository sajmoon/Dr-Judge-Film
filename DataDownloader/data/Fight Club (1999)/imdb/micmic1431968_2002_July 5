2002_July 5 

As another reviewer noted, I don't understand why this movie has any
special
appeal to anyone who isn't a teenager. It's not a bad movie and I think
I
would have probably enjoyed it more if I wasn't expecting  much more.
There
are indeed some questions asked concerning consumerism and petite
bourgeoisie, but they never rise above a dissapointingly basic level.
The
infamous &quot;twist&quot; near the end is not as spectacular as advertised by
other
reviewers. Not really surrealistic, not really a protest movie, not
really a
psychological thriller, but something in-between that remains
unacomplished.
Good but not *that* good.
