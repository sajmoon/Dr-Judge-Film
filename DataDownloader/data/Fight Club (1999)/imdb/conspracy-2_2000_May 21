I can not say much about this film. I have just finished watching it this
instant, and it's taking its sweet time to sink in.<br /><br />I can talk about the shallow stuff. The direction, as always with David
Fincher, is impressive, innovative and flawless. He seems to be able to
bring out hidden levels of talent in his actors. Even the usually good Brad
Pitt moves up a notch when taking directions from Mr. Fincher. The camera,
quickly and smoothly moves around places in some sequences that are, well,
impossible to film. Everything about this film's feel relates to Edward
Norton's inner character. It's just excellently well done.<br /><br />I can talk about the role of Brad Pitt as the Jesus-like rebel with the
anti-establishment ideas and his rounding up of brainwashed disciples. A
little controversial parallel, but in the bigger scope of things I think
it's suitable.<br /><br />The resolution of this film is unexpected and excellent. Do all you can not
to know anything about this film before you see it. The surprises should be
surprising (and they are).<br /><br />I gave this film a 9. The only thing that held me back from giving it a 10
was the 'I am Jack's over-used joke line' (although it does, come to think
of it, make sense in light of the ending). It it still an absolute must-see
film.<br /><br />
