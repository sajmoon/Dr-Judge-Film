Fantastic!
Excelent!
Great!
Wotta movie! One of the best ever. It's absolutely unbelieveble, from the
begining until the end.
David Fincher proves again his extraordinary abbilities as a director
(after
he amazed the world with &quot;The game&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;) and realizes a real work
of
art. A perfect combination of thriller, dark comedy and
psichological.
David Fincher+Brad Pitt+Edward Norton--super!
Brad Pitt shows everyone that he's not only appreciated because of his
looks, but because he has a certain ammount of talent.<br /><br />And Edward Norton... what can I say?
&quot;I am Jack's mountain of rage and anger&quot;.
If that wasn't an Oscar performance, then which is? He plaied fabulous, and
if those people from the American Film Academy weren't that one-sided,
taking in consideration only dramas or love-stories, and would take a short
glance at another type of movies, like &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Norton would have been
admiring right this very moment a well deserved gold statue. The movie is
too violent to have any other effect on critics but repulsion, but its real
value cannot be judged. At least in my mind, the Oscar for a leading role
sounds like this: &quot;The winner is... Edward Norton.&quot;
About the movie... only good things to say. It's absolutly delightful. The
furniture needed by Edward's appartement, the explosion, the reason for
people to fight, the horrible, unconscient laughter of Pitt, when he's
beaten by the owner of the bar, the scenes between Edward and his boss,
everything is made to perfection.
I can't end this without saying something about Helena Carter, who
completes
the greatness of the movie, playing very good a tough and interesting
role.
And the ending... great!<br /><br />So, all of' ya, who wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT!
All of' ya who don't wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT!
All of' ya who saw this movie before, GO SEE IT!<br /><br />It would be the wisest choice ever.<br /><br />Grading: 11 (out of 10).<br /><br />Chris, Brasov, Romania.
