Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this the best movie of all time? Now,
it might be a little violent in places but that doesn't mean it can't
be good too. All the violence is completely necessary to the plot and
character development and in fact it gives an impression of containing
far more violence than it really has - surely one sign of a good movie
already.<br /><br />The dialogue and the voice over is clever and witty e.g. &quot;I still can't
think of anything to say.&quot; &quot;Ah, flashback humour.&quot; as the film catches
up with itself and EN has a gun in his mouth.<br /><br />The editing is all neat and slick.<br /><br />The screen play and directing is outstanding. I was going to site an
example or two but as I sit here, so many little scenes or parts of
scenes suggest themselves that it impossible to pick one or two out,
it's like trying to pick the best Beatles songs.<br /><br />The acting is monumental. Brad Pitt is somewhat larger than life but in
fact he *is* larger than life. Edward Norton is ideal and it is so
right that he isn't a hunk of meat like just about every other leading
man these days. HBC is perfect, you feel you know her so well, a total
head case that you can't help being drawn to.<br /><br />The plot is, needless to say, awesome. The film takes the novel, makes
it it's own thing and then surpasses even the novel.<br /><br />What more do you want from a film for goodness sake? Well, what you
want are 'little touches' that are unique. Like the almost subliminal
clips of Tyler flashing throughout the film; The 'oh well' look that
Edward Norton gives after beating Blondy to a pulp; The way Brad Pitt's
pants are almost down to his crotch in the soap shop; The fact that the
act of destruction in which Robert Paulson dies is called &quot;Operation
Latte Thunder&quot;; The line &quot;I haven't been ufcked liked that since grade
school.&quot;; The way Tyler (BP) throws things on the ground with such
force all the time. I could go on.<br /><br />Name me a better film and I'm pretty sure that I can say that, you may
prefer it to Fight Club, but Fight Club is still a better film. I have
a few films that I prefer over Fight Club but that is because they
tweek my buttons in just the right way but Fight Club just is a really
good film.<br /><br />Did I mention that I think its quite good already?
