If you love movies where you sit watching it and try to figure out what is
going on before it climaxes this is a definate must see. I'm obviously a
major Brad Pitt fan, but this movie is over the top. I've watched and
re-watched it many times and each time I've seen things I failed to notice
before. This makes it a good movie in and of itself. It was also
refreshing
not to see Pitt in the typical &quot;pretty boy&quot; role and the twist is as
rewarding as other &quot;now&quot; movies like The Others, The Sixth Sense and
Vanilla
Sky.
