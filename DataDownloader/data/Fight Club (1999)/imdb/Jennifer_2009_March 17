This is by far my favorite film of all time. I was very hesitant to
watch this film at first, but now cannot imagine having never seen it.
It has absolutely raised the bar, and so far no other film I have seen
has met that standard yet.<br /><br />Anyone who says this is a &#39;guy movie&#39; is absolutely wrong. It is truly
unique, and in my opinion an important and almost life changing film.
It has definitely changed my view of the world a bit. It&#39;s a must see
film, and my advice for anyone hesitant to watch is to ignore the title
and cover and just dive right in. It will far surpass your
expectations. It certainly surpassed mine. I would also recommend
watching it more than one time. I can&#39;t even count how many times I
have watched this film.
