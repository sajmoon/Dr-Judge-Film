While many people will simply dismiss the movie as an attempt to tap the
&quot;Inner Male&quot; or &quot;Base Instinct&quot; it was a relevant movie in a philisophical
sense. Allow me to explain a little further, those whom have read Nietzsche
may skip the next paragraph. If you have not I urge you to pay special
attention to it.<br /><br />In many of Nietzsche's books and notes, especially Geneaology of Morals and
Will to Power, he talks about morals and nihilism. Tyler Durden is the
ultimate in nihilism, or negation philosophy. Tyler is sick, in Nietzsche's
words &quot;decadent.&quot; He represents the force of change because he can no
longer
relate to societal mores, and plans to bring the current system down. *He*
will become the force behind change, and negate life as we know it. Tyler,
however, is not alone in being sick. Nietzsche would also view society as
decadent, simply to be capable of producing a &quot;Tyler Durden.&quot; This is
really
too brief a space to enter into his thoughts in entirety. If you are
interested please check out some books of his, especially those translated
by Walter Kaufmann.<br /><br />As for the movie: I could see this happening in a heartbeat. The
feminazation of the male psyche continues unabated. Males growing up are
constantly wondering exactly how to be &quot;Male&quot; and in this respect Fight
Club
comes to it's own. It is the ultimate Alpha Male movie, with philosophical
undertones that take it much further.<br /><br />That a man is instinctively a fighter is true. We claw for everything and
it
still isn't enough. It will probably never be enough and we should not try
to change a few millenia of evolution with some behavioral therapy. Man is
a
killer, in fact we are one of the few species of animals that will kill
it's
own kind. We do it for space, food, money, &quot;peace&quot;, or simply because we
like to, depending on the personality. What the movie shows is man
returning
to himself. Religions and politicians be damned, Master/Slave morality is
here to stay.
