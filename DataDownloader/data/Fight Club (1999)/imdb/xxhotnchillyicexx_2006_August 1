Thanks for the facts and summary, but i&#39;m more interested as to how the
structure of his film affects the content or meaning of the &#39;story&#39;.
Why is it told in a narrative&#39;s POV? would it alter the story if
structured otherwise? Why is the time line formed in this way and what
purpose does it serve to us the viewers? How does the telling (in
chronological or vice versa) of the story affect my point of view about
the main characters in the movie? I&#39;m more interested in the formal
structure of this film to have a better appreciation for its artistry.
Everyone has their own interpretation of the movie-I&#39;d just like to
know &quot;why?&quot;
