<br /><br />Fight Club....what exactly is it? Is it a gathering of dis-illusioned men
fighting one another to engage their primal instincts in order to find
their
true meaning in life? Or does it refer to the fight within ourselves, of a
man's soul trying to fight its way out from convention, from materialism,
from a lack of direction in life? Or maybe it's just a story about a man
who
is going insane?<br /><br />Make of it what you will, but Fight Club is definitely one of the most
memorable films of the past decade. Edward Norton is superb in his role as
The Narrator (or is that Jack?), and, after a few mediocre performances
recently, Brad Pitt excels as the ultra-cool (check out his wardrobe!) yet
ultra-devious Tyler Durden. But perhaps the biggest suprise is Helena
Bonham-Carter, who sheds her image as a period drama queen and comes out
kicking and screaming as Marla Singer, a tough character who the viewer
slowly warms to.<br /><br />Some say that the ending is a bit of a disappointment, but in a way, it is
clever in the way it twists the story on its head. But this is definitely a
film that makes you think long and hard about yourself. Indeed, our lives
are ending, one minute at a time, and I for one don't want to be remembered
as the &quot;all-singing, all dancing crap of the world&quot; with a pair of khakis
on, surrounded by Swedish furniture and clever art.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent film which I would recommend to anyone. Gentlemen,
welcome to Fight Club.
