This brilliant slice of cinema from David Fincher left many thoughts in
my head. One of the less philosophical thoughts was could this film
have been released after September 11 without the censors intervening?
I think not.<br /><br />This film is promoted in the wrong way too. It is hardly disturbing
compared to films that are even slightly underground. But the point is,
all the hype and world events surrounding this film do not change the
fact that it is a brilliant film and something I didn't think the
mainstream would achieve for a long time.<br /><br />Themes of terrorism, anti-commercialism and identity-crisis are all
explored and it has one of the best closing scenes I have ever seen.<br /><br />All in all, not the best movie made or anything, but a mainstream movie
worth seeing.
