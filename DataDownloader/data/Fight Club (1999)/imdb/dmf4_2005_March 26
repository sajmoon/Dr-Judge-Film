Great movie and a reality check for our consumer society, i don't like
its one reference about god and religion, but its criticism of society
and our values is entirely legitimate and worth watching over and
over... definitely one of my favorite movies. If you like this movie
you should also watch clockwork Orange, 12 monkeys, good will hunting,
Amelie plain and others. I think one of the greatest things this movie
successfully accomplishes is forcing the audience to reflect upon their
own lives and take stock of their own goals and passions. the author is
very clever in using some of his own experiences with looking hurt and
society's narrow minded superficial judgment of people to create a
master piece of modern times. I feel that as time goes by this movie
will be placed with others such as clockwork orange and vanilla sky and
cinematic eye openers and timeless classics.
