What a disappointment. Strong performances by Norton, Pitt and
Bonham-Carter
could not save a flawed plot. The twist in the tail was not as calculated
and cunning as the one in &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and leaves countless answers
begging. It's hard to believe that even the most perturbed and lost of men
would want to follow a man that beats himself up in a parking lot and
supposedly talks to his alter-ego frequently. What could have been poignant
commentary on male angst in an ever increasing female dominated society is
negated in the movie's final scenes. Men might feel emasculated and angry,
but so much to want to return to a more primitive state of society? I doubt
it.
