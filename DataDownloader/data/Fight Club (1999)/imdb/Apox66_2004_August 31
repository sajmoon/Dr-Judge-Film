I beseech you, noble reader, to name me a postmodern film. It's
certainly not easy, because Postmodernism is not only a difficult term
to define, but also a difficult term to set into a category. This is
because Postmodernism in itself rejects catagorisation. The simple
definition is &quot;Of or Relating to art which reacts against modernist
principles.&quot; This means it rejects genre boundaries and employs irony,
parody, playfulness and ambiguity. Lots of big words eh? But to truly
understand the genius of Director David Fincher, you have to
understand, or at least have an idea of, how complicated Postmodernism
really is. It's difficult enough to write down on paper, especially
difficult to draw or create a piece of art out of, and [I would expect]
incredibly difficult to create a film out of. Yet Fincher managed this
with Fight Club.<br /><br />Fight Club is a truly terrific piece of art. It's about psychology,
it's about conformity, it's about fascism, it's about communism [!],
it's about free speech, it's about enlightenment, it's about self
improvement via self destruction, it's about the nature of violence;
All these themes rolled up into one two-hour long assault on your
senses. It's multi-genre structure gives this film a very clever
intellectual twist while staying incredibly entertaining throughout
it's length.<br /><br />Many people complain that the film is too violent. I disagree; the
violence, while being quite strong when on screen, is artistic in it's
own context. The abuse of one's self for one's personal enlightenment.
It is funny at the same time as being cynical, it is religious at the
same time as being political, it is revolutionary at the same time as
employing millennia-old philosophy. While the twist at the end takes
some considerable thought to truly understand, it is nonetheless an
incredibly feat of misdirection. A truly beautiful mix of
Intellectualism and Brutality; one of my favourite films of all time.<br /><br />[By the Way; If you haven't seen this film yet I'm not going to give
you a synopsis of the storyline; you don't need one. Go and buy it,
NOW!]
