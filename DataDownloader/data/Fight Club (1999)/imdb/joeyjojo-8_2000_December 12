2000_December 12 

This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen, and quite possibly the
greatest movie of my generation.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a
phenomenal job of telling a remarkable story about two completely opposite
people and their fun little club.  It is truly a shame that this film,
it's
director and it's actors all got snubbed by Oscar.  David Fincher is a
brilliant director that uses creative shot selection and special effects
to
create a remarkable piece of imagery.  This movie is a must see for any
fan
of good, suspenseful, psychological film.
