I wrote a review for Fight Club earlier, but then I was emailed by someone
who said to see it again with a more open mind. So I did, but I just
couldn't take it anymore. Like someone said before, just realizing that
you're doing something bad makes it okay? And, Ikea catalog to fight
club-i'll take the catalog, because if anything I will get more from that
than fighting for no apparent reason. Sure, they're journeying for
self-discovery, but how does that excuse them from it? People don't realize,
that you don't (gasp) have to sink this low. This is not a movie-this is a
statement by the evil lords below us saying to dump everything you own and
fight, and you will be closer to discovery. This is truly awful cinema, so
rotten I wonder how any studio in their right mind would pick it up. It's
too preachy, cynical, and just downright offensive and stupid. Please,
before you make this movie 3 dollars richer by renting it, reconsider. You
can get the same message (is there even a message in this trash) by inviting
your friends over to IKEA and fighting publicly. Hmm, not so smart is it? I
gave it a generous 3 I think, (earlier) but now even the first 30 minutes
don't interest me. Wanna stupid, pointless movie? Fight Club is right down
your alley. 1/10
