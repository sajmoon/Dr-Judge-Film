Wow. this is such a great movie. Although it does have its controversy,
and
at times an be disturbing...for instance when &quot;jack&quot; wanted to destroy
something beatiful. This movie also has some of the best lines i have
ever
heard in my life, such as &quot;We're designed to be hunters and we're in a
society of shopping. There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to
fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that social
emasculation
this everyman is created.&quot;<br /><br />Its true that this movie does that a few viewings to fully understand it,
but everytime i see it, it gets better and better. This movie is one that
really makes you think, and is so logical. Ed Norton and Brad Pitt put on
the greatest performances of their careers in this movie, Ed Norton even
smokes in it. (If you didnt know why this this is such a big deal b/c its
because Norton is a avid non-smoker. During the production of &quot;Rounders&quot;
he
threated to quit if they didnt change his character who was supposed to
be a
smoker.)<br /><br />Truly an amazing movie....on a scale of 1 to 10....i give it a
38!!!!
