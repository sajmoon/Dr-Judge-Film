There aren't many movies that have came along and made me think so much
during its viewing. I can say that I have seen this one prolly way too
many times that any normal man should and have a copy of the script as
well. It would take me forever to explain all of the intelligence and
pure genius generated throughout this film. Fight Club hit me on so
many levels,unexpectedly I may add. I first viewed this in my Senior
drama class via the best drama teacher ever Mr.Wheeler. He said he was
disappointed that this movie didn't get the awards that it deserved. He
couldn't have been any more right. This film is superbly directed by
David Fincher,who I thought never did a better job than Se7en and I was
wrong until I seen this. I don't have to explain its plot just that if
u haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it. I doubt many people will
be disappointed. I have seen and heard of all of the &quot;overrated&quot; labels
this one gets. And if I jumped on the bandwagon for this one, then so
be it. This one makes you think and there is not a boring second in
this to me. Although it does have some rather noticeable goofs(Bob dead
and easily seen still breathing and the ever popular goof,the bench
that was rammed into the glass door that moves a good 3 feet or so
suddenly in the shot after its used to break the glass. LMAO.!) Other
than that I say watch this and be ready to be hit with great fight
scenes, a love story, a friendship story if you will and of course its
&quot;bruising comedy&quot; as put on the movie case. Thanx to the cast and crew
for changing the way i look at movies for this one...
