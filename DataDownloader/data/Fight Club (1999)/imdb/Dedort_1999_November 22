1999_November 22 

This is an interesting film - the violence appears more a side issue to
the
really acid take &quot;Fight Club&quot; has on society. Then again, the violence is
why quite a few people went to see it. If they went for straight out gore
though, the hopefully left considering more interesting issues.<br /><br />I thoroughly disagree with those who state this is an irresponsible pion
to
Nazism... heavy-handed, sure (black shirts and soap) but, I don't see why
it
was particularly at fault: after all it drips cynicism and just cannot be
read as a straight ahead film.
I don't think it was saying men are defined only by aggression, rather
that
- men can easily be defined only by aggression.
I particularly liked the creeping madness infecting the men of America -
the
idea of a surreal, out of control secret society. The lead two, Pitt and
Norton, are great... unhinged, and repressed respectively.<br /><br />Helena Bonham-Carter is actually really good too(in a fairly slight role)
as
a rather dysfunctional love interest. I thought it quite a thoughtful film
(if you reference Emerson, you automatically get a brownie point from
me!)
The incredibly eye-catching/hyper real visuals added to a sense of
subverted
reality. It does rather seem to be a film of two (long!) halves - the
first
rather more spiteful and sharp, the second violent and
surreal.
