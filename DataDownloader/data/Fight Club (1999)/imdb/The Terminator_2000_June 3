Fight Club has all the requirements a cool action movie needs, however its
overly long running time and dark atmosphere allows it to go only a certain
distance. Edward Norton plays a fantastic role in this violent thriller and
Brad Pitt  also comes across well but the storyline lacks clarity and
explanation. I am very surprised that this reached number 29 in the top 250
films as there are far more exciting and better developed movies out there
and the fact that it bettered my personal favourite Terminator 2 was a real
shock. Nevertheless, I would give this film 6 out of 10.
