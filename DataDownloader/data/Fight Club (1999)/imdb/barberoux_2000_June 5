2000_June 5 

I thought a lot about this movie.  I enjoyed it.  Plot twists were done well
and the acting was good.  Helena Bonham Carter has succeeded in debasing her
smoldering good looks sufficiently enough to become unappealing.  Maybe she
believes depth to be gleaned from heroin chic.  Brad Pitt's ego was cleverly
used as a plot device.  The premise of the movie of men finding some meaning
to life in fighting has some appeal.  Here I sit, screwing off at work,
because of the debasement I feel from the layers of management above me. 
The feeling of being controlled by people I have little respect for and like
less for the paycheck so I can pay the mortgage and the credit card bills. 
I want to punch some faces in but I'm restrained by social mores.  I want to
rebel against the suits but need the money.  So I passively resist
convention.  I'm contrary.  The men in the movie found their outlet in
fighting then by allowing themselves to be debased into obeying automatons. 
How ironic.  The answer to our self hatred at being social parasites is not
debasement.  That seems to be self hatred.  Taking punishment as penance for
our weakness.  Maybe the answer lies in having integrity.  That is what the
movie lacked.  That is what is so hard to maintain in our society.   That I
feel is the answer more than blowing up things because someone told you to. 
But it doesn't sell tickets.  A movie that sparks introspection is worth
watching.  This movie, though it finally sold out, is worth
watching.
