Best film I have ever seen.Perfect,absolutely perfect.No more to say. It
will be a classic.Director David Fincher created a very unique experience
for us. This is film that can change a kids life.Many people started get
interested in film studies because of this masterpiece.
His name is Tyler Durden...Nothing more....Nothing less....
