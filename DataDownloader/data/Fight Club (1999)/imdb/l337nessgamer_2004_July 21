this is an amazing film, a definite must see. excellent performances by
both edward norton and brad pitt. this film took me and all my friends
on a roller-coaster ride of twists and turns that nobody could predict.
WATCH THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />here is a little summary of the film: jack (edward norton) who has a
boring office job, a boring condo, and who lives with insomnia by
constantly going to support groups. jack is sent by his boss on a
business trip and on one of the flights he meets tyler durden (brad
pitt). jack comes home to see his condo in flames and goes to live with
tyler. there they create a new support group, a fight club. eventually
this fight club evolves becoming what tyler calls project mayhem. from
here on out the film really twists you around so i wont ruin any
surprises. but once again, this film is a must see.
