This is probably the best movie ever made. Definitely one of the best.
It takes my personal favorite elements of film and storytelling
(Depiction of mental deterioration, black humor, Sarcasm, Interesting
and ambiguous philosophical messages to ponder, and excellent
quotability).<br /><br />One of the best things about it would be the presentation of every
situation. Specifically, how everything gets a slightly insane touch
that makes sense in a strange way. Everything from the first instance
playing tourist at support groups to the time when Tyler threatens to
kill a store clerk unless he follow his dream of becoming a
veterinarian in six moths is depicted in this way. First with
absurdity, then with sense. The entire movie is tied together as one
long, insane journey that you will thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />The other thing about this movie that is good is that you will want to
see it several times. They give you a lot to chew on. What appears to
be failed continuity turns out to be foreshadowing, finding all the
hints and clues to the big twist, and also watching the movie with
knowledge of what is truly happening (luxury you won&#39;t have your first
time through...though this is a good thing), and paying more attention
to the various subliminal frames that populate the movie. Oh, and if
you are the type of person who must use movie quotes and references
continuously, this movie will be something you will watch over and over
again.<br /><br />Bottom line, see this movie.
