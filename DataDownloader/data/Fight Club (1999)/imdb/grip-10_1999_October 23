1999_October 23 

Fight Club was a real thinker of a film, I liked it so much, that I went to
see it again, and was blown away by the fact that Sony Theatres where I
first saw it had left out a roll of about 30 very important minutes, and
hey, we like it the first time, but the second viewing answered a lot of
questions...to bad all those other folks had no idea and probably didn't
give this film credit where credit was due....I would definitely recommend
it..<br /><br />Too bad I can't say much without giving all away.
