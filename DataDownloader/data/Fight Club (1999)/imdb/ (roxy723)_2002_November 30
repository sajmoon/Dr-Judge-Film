This was one of the most disturbing movies I have seen...and I loved it!
The plot was twisted, the acting wonderful, and the film as a whole is one
of my favorites.  Perhaps the best thing about the movie is you don't stop
thinking about it when it's over.  The movie ends and you're just like,
&quot;Wow.&quot;
