1999_December 16 

Without a doubt the most vicious, system screwing Hollywood motion picture
since Oliver Stone's misunderstood masterpiece, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;,
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is the closest that cinema has come to perfection in
decades.<br /><br />Every element is relevant and brilliantly executed; from David Fincher's
dark, kinetic vision of contemporary dystopia, to Jim Uhls' literate and
extravagantly clever adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's (only slightly
inferior) novel. Edward Norton is superlative as usual, and Brad Pitt is
good enough to make you forgive him for numerous bad performances in
numerous bad movies. The Dust Brothers soundtrack fits like a glove, and the
film has THE most impressive twist I have yet seen in a movie, effectively
changing the viewers perspective completely. This is a film that gains much
weight from repeated viewings. <br /><br />Praised and derided in equal measure by press and public worldwide, &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is a not a film that will win any awards or break any box office
records. What it is, is a film that will no doubt obtain a cult following
and a good reputation as time passes, with a message that will only become
more relevant with future generations who discover it.
