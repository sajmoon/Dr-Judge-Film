What can I say but this is the best movie I have ever seen its so gritty,
dark, sometime cynical, insightful, filled with dark comedy, and loaded with
information (that whole thing about how to make napalm and soap might come
in handy sometime).  If you've seen this movie it might make you think twice
when you even think to or about yourself.  The way the narrarator's life is
makes me wonder constantly will my life ever be like that in ways I would
hope it would be and some aspects of it I wouldn't want.  What can I say
about Edward Norton's amazing acting except that was some amazing acting.
Although I feel he was over looked since Brad Pitt is more popular I think
his performance in the movie blew Brad Pitt out of the water.  Don't get me
wrong Brad Pitt was amazing but Edward Norton fit and played the role better
than anyone I can think of.  Although I hate Helena Bonham Carter with a
passion she fit and played the role great despite her English accent she
made by with minimal mistakes.  And who could forget the other things that
made this movie what it is like the subliminal Tylers, Meatloaf and his
bitch tits, the darkness of the scenes, and the Dust Brothers' music.  Not
to mention the ending song by the Pixies it puts the whole movie into a
great closing.  For anyone who hasn't seen the movie go see it don't rent it
buy it and for those of you who have seen the movie buy the book I did and
it's even better.  Oh and for all you people who look for secrets in movies
look all the way to the right when Edward Norton is watching the hotel movie
you might see Tyler Durden at work.
