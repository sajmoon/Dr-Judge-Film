2002_April 3 

A visually amazing update on the Jekyll and Hyde story, with a twist that
will have you pressing rewind as soon as the closing credits start rolling
(much in the same way as the Sixth Sense or Memento). Pitt, who, following
Twelve monkeys and Se7en, is gradually endearing himself to me, gives a
mesmerising performance as Tyler Durden, a dark, modern-day philosopher.
Norton is even better as the monotone narrator, as is Bonham-Carter as
Marla
Singer, a FAAAR cry away from Merchant-Ivory; and Meatloaf is surprisingly
good in a veeery bizarre role.
Maybe it's the quick-fire editing, the incredibly dark humour (which is
often very funny) or the dialogue that makes you think twice, but I just
can't get enough of this movie. Forget any political, fascist or
homosexual
subtext, and accept this film for what it is: a unique blend of
intelligence
and entertainment. Mr Fincher, I salute you.<br /><br />However, when I watched this first of all in the cinema with a friend, she
drew my attention to how violent it was; c'mon, I've seen a LOT worse. And
hey, wouldn't we miss out on some great cinema if certain other movies
that
have 'inspired' infamous true-life acts of violence were never made: Taxi
Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs etc. ? I rest my
case.<br /><br />So, if you are squeamish, my advice is to find a friend who has already
seen
it to guide you through the violent parts, because if you are put off
solely
for that reason, then you would be missing a great movie.
9/10, deducting one for the utter confusion that reigned after I first saw
it- repeat viewings clarify things!<br /><br />And ladies, for God's sake, don't just rent it out for 'Brad's abs',
because
there is a lot, lot more to this film than bloody well
that!
