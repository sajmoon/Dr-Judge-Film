Okay the strange thing about this movie is how it ended up in like the
top 10 of this list, this list is for the GREATEST movies of all time
and this does not rank anywhere near, i mean this is one of the dumbest
plots I&#39;ve ever watched, it goes from just a guy who is a little
stressed and begins to fight with brad pitt, okay seems logical he had
a bad day but then it goes to the same old story where brad pitt
doesn&#39;t exist, or does he we don&#39;t know but whatever right. Then he
fighting stops and we head off and start blowing buildings up, why the
hell are they going around now blowing buildings up, if they make a
fight club why don&#39;t they beat the crap out of the people who work
there, is that to much work, i thought blowing up buildings was even
more harder than fighting but thats not to judge here right now, or is
it, see this review is just as confusing as the movie, people who voted
6 or higher on this movie needs to get their head examined.
