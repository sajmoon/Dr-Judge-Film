It&#39;s one of the best movies I have ever seen .. I really wonder : How
Edward Norton &amp; Brad Pitt were not nominated for Oscars about their
rules in that Great Movie ?! .. and how the genius director &quot;David
Fincher&quot; wasn&#39;t nominated as the best director about this wonderful
movie ?! Edward Norton played the best rule for him in that Great movie
.. He is a sick man , who suffers from insomnia and that makes him out
of the balance .. so , He sees strange persons , things &amp; slept in a
place to wake up in another place so, he says &quot;Was I Sleep ?! .. Have I
Slept ?! &quot; .. a doctor advised him to visit conferences of people who
suffer from cancer to see how they pain , To feel that he is better
than many people .. he went and find himself cry with cancer victims
and he able to sleep ! and events follows to find a big surprise during
the movie ! .. Brad Pitt too , played one of the best rules for him ..
He played a man who is a clever , rude and dangerous and he want to
make a monster from the sick man &quot;Edward Norton&quot; .. Really both of them
played their rules as magicians ! I think that great movie didn&#39;t get
his right in Osacr 2000 .. because, there were many great movies with
it in that year as &quot;The Matrix&quot; , &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;American
Beauty&quot; .. but , in the fact .. i see that Edawrd , Brad &amp; David
Finsher should nominataed for Oscars about that great wonderful movie .
About the music .. I&#39;ll say wow ! .. The sound track is a magical ,
Espesially Ost about &quot;Finding The Bomb&quot; . I give that great movie 10
out of 10 .. and I see It worth more than 10 ! Really, It&#39;s one of the
best movies that you will see .. It places number &quot;21&quot; of the top 250
movies now .. but &#39; I see it must be between the first &quot;15&quot; .. You must
see this amazing movie . Finally , I&#39;ll say on the way of &quot;Edward
Norton&quot; in that great movie : &quot;Was I Sleep ?! .. Have I slept ?!! &quot; ..
And I&#39;ll answer : Yes, I think that i was sleeping ! .. because, I
didn&#39;t watch an ordinary movie ! .. but , I watched a dream !!
