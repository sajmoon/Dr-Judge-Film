This is one of those movies that about a quarter of the way through, you
realize its essence.  Preachy.  Fight Club sucks you in after 10 minutes
and
wants to teach you a lesson about how alienated we've become from our
true,
'pure selves'.  This movie makes me sad to be a part of this generation,
but
not for the reasons that the writer of Fight Club proposes.  People who
educate themselves, get a job, find themselves somebody they love, and
provide for their families are not bad people.  Becoming an American is
not
to become less human.  It's the same
upper-white-class-guilt-ridden-drivel:
We are slaves to society, we only live for material things....isn't this
getting old?  Talk to some people in developing nations around the world.
Talk to some people who survived WWII.  Is our way of life really so bad?
This movie will have you thinking so.  That is, if you buy into the
pseudo-intellectual 'meaning' behind it.  All I could think about while
watching this movie was how some people would buy into the ludicrous mores
of this movie and start their own 'Fight Club'.  The flip side to this
argument? If the movie made me react this strongly, I guess they did their
job!
