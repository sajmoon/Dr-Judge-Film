I have finally got around to seeing this movie, and after all its hype
and all its acclaim, I&#39;m pleased to say it&#39;s deserving of it it all. I
have gone out of my way to avoid this film for almost 5 years, often
watching far inferior films instead, and now i have seen it, i can&#39;t
think why?<br /><br />Edward Norton (Jack) is an insomniac who seeks solace in joining help
groups for cancer, blood disorders, etc. and his addiction for them
grows the more he attends. That is until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt) and they form their own help group (FIGHT CLUB) where grown men
can join and beat each other up to forget their troubles. And so an
underground sect is formed, as Jack and Tyler&#39;s ideas spread like the
plague, Jack soon realises that all is not quite what it seems.<br /><br />Brilliantly directed, and solid performances from all the cast, Fight
Club is an undoubted winner, packed with action, slick dialogue,
comedy, violence and much more.<br /><br />9/10 What are you waiting for - SEE IT!
