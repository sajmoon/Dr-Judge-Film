Envision the surreal psycho-drama of Being John Malkovich, pump in some
testosterone overdrive and anti-establishment satire (and heck even a Sixth
Sense twist at the end!) and I found myself in one of the downright craziest
films ever. Also the soundtrack turns out to be one of the most distinctive
along with that of The Matrix. Still I found it thoroughly enjoyable and
deserves to be one of the must-watch titles of 1999. (A strong
7/10).
