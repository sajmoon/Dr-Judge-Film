1999_October 23 

I saw lots of good reviews for this film, and I and 3 other friends went to
go see it.  It all sums up to this, some nice violent scenes and a sort of
funny attempt at an interesting plot (done many times before in about 50
movies), but most importantly the camera views.  By that I mean to say that
the movies starts out with some really great camera views, with the use of
computer images and such.  That I
really liked, but then about 30 minutes into the movie they stop using all
those camera views and computer edited scenes and such.  It's really
inconsistent, maybe they ran out of money or something, but I doubt that
it's for an artistic expression.  Altogether the movie was really long and
after talking with my friends and some other people at the movie, no one
really enjoyed it much.  We all just wanted it to end.  I don't know how
this got on the best movies of all time list, but most importantly; save
your money!
