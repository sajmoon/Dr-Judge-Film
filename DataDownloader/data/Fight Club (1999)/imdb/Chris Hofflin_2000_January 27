I wasn't a huge fan of David Fincher's 'Seven' but this effort is a truly
clever piece of work that makes sense at various levels of comprehension. A
nice blend of intellectual musings about what makes a man a man in a career
and material oriented society and the emotion of desperately unhappy man
trying to break out of this monotonous existence. A rare balance delivered
at a good pace.
