When I watched this movie for the first time,It was just another movie
with some looser narrator trying to change his life. When I watched it
again I started realizing the layers of this AMAZING movie.And now this
is my favorite movie ever after GODFATHER. The narration with its DARK
HUMOUR is absolutely amazing.Hats Off to David fincher for his visual
style. The quotes in this movie are amazing, the ones like &#x22;We are a
generation of men raised by women,I don&#x27;t think another women is the
answer to my problem&#x22;.And the best part is the Awesome Twist in the
end,The Twist would have been a clich&#xE9;d one if it was not for the
script writer and the director. Its a movie worth collecting and
watching it again and again.
