This movie was a sigh a relief. After seeing this, I realized that I'm not
the only one out there that is fed up with this fake, boring, and original
generation this is turning into. This movie is the anti statement against
all those people who care so much about how they look, how much money they
have, and what kind of music will make me cool. This film tells us to be
ourselves, to not follow the leader anymore. We've grown up. Don't let your
life go to waste trying to impress others.<br /><br />In the terms of Tyler's disclaimer at the beginning of the
DVD:<br /><br />Quit your job, start a fight, prove your alive. If you don't claim your
hummantiy, you will be a statistic.
