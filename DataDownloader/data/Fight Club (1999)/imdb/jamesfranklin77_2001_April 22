When i first saw this film at the cinema, i was blown away with how thought
provoking it was. I went to see this movie just expecting a dumb brained
film about bare knuckle fighting, but was amazed how much more it
was.
I then watched it again and again. But the more i watch this the worst it
gets.
It really is just a macho movie, which quotes great lines from the
book.
Do yourself a favour and read the book instead, which is great, and then
just watch any Rocky movie (its more fun) instead.
