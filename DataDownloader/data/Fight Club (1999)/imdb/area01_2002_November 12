Fight Club is a great film working on a number of levels. Forget &quot;getting
it&quot; or &quot;not getting it&quot; - just view it and make your own mind up. It's
never
going to get a indifferent response - it will always be emotive, and you
will love it or hate it. Probably the way it should always be with
something
that wants to upset the status quo and get a reaction.<br /><br />Where to start? It's covers Love, Death, Greed, Black Comedy, Social
Satire,
Consumerism, Male Violence, Male Love, Self-Image, Self-Loathing,
Self-Improvement, Masturbation, Celebrity Fighting, Waiting Tables and
Pumping Gas.<br /><br />As this is my first time writing one of these reviews - it's funny, you
read
what you wrote and it comes across as slightly &quot;bullet point movie
critic&quot; -
oh well.<br /><br />For my two pence worth - a superb film that stands up to repeated viewings
and should speak to you on personal level - if you are wondering about
your
place in today's world.<br /><br />The violence seems in keeping with the anarchistic tone of the movie, and
goes someway to justifying it as a natural reaction from a so-called
&quot;lost&quot;
generation. I feel it's truthful in stating that it's part of our nature
and
does a good job in exploring this trait.<br /><br />The film gets bleak and heavy-going in places - but has lovely moments of
black comedy. Being addicted to Ikea Catalogues and Self-Help Groups made
me
smile, and finding your safe little Condo Life blown out onto the street
must have been something.<br /><br />All the performances are first-class - Director David Fincher takes a
wonderful book and puts it on the screen almost word-for-word, with great
care and skill. The dialogue is sharp, and the pacing fast enough to keep
you interested over a fairly long film.<br /><br />I think it deserves the title &quot;first great movie of the new millennium&quot; -
but, see for yourself and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Being an individual is part of the message of the movie.....
