Never have I seen a movie that begins to touch viewers on as many
levels as Fight Club does. The movie gives a very in-depth look at
people's perception of reality and just how confused and innate humans
can become. The movie itself is amazingly executed and well balanced. I
can't think of any way to improve upon the cinematography of the movie,
and the plot was far from lacking. When I started my quest to watch all
of the best movies ever created, Fight Club was high on the list of
'must sees', and it did indeed live up to my expectations. Not only
does the movie provide quite a warped and bizarre look at humanity and
reality, but also provides the view with well rounded, solid violence
in a none excessive way. I would defiantly say this is one of the most
amazing movies of all time, if you want to watch a movie that will make
you think, Fight Club is for you.
