&quot;Fight Club&quot; does the best job of any film I've seen in conveying the
pathetic truth of how dependent people (particularly teenagers) have
become
on materials in this country. As a High School sophmore, I assure you I
see
it all around me; Kids feeling insecure because they don't wear Gap
clothing, or getting put down because their parents didn't buy them a Land
Rover when they turned 16.
It's pathetic, and this is only one subject which &quot;Fight Club&quot;
addresses
strongly. (I want to make it clear that this is NOT exclusively what&quot;Fight
Club&quot; is about, but it is what I personally took out of it the
most.)<br /><br />The film isn't necessarily aimed at my age group, but I think it
should be. After all, my generation is the one which is being fed all this
materialistic crap, and is definetly most affected by it. I'm sick and
tired
of movies like &quot;Drive Me Crazy,&quot; and &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; to name a few, where
Hollywood tries to relate to teenagers when it's just reinforcing exactly
what &quot;Fight Club&quot; rips apart (You have to be popular to be somebody. You
have to wear this, etc). So for all those kids who are trying to fit in
with
the &quot;in-crowd&quot; here's a little tip; See &quot;Fight Club,&quot; and BE YOUR OWN
PERSON. Thank you David Fincher, Chuck Palahniuk, Jim Uhls, Brad Pitt and
Edward Norton for bringing this masterpiece to the country's attention.
