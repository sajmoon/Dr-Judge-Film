Two points. Firstly, it's slightly worrying how many people like or at
least
identify with this movie. There seem to be a disturbing number of
Narrator/Tylers out there. Many of these however miss the point of the
Third
Act. Like many movements which appear to liberate the (male) persona and
offer fulfilment to those who dare, Fight Club ultimately becomes a
menace -
an army of automatons that not even their leader can control. Tyler thus
represents not just the power of the unleashed male psyche but the dark
side
of that power, the blind obedience that leads to a nightmare world of
terrorism, Nazism, the Klan, Oklahoma etc. The movie is, in the end, an
indictment, not an endorsement of the macho ethos. Secondly, the story
contains one major plot problem. &quot;Tyler&quot; has knowledge and skills (making
soap, nitroglycerine) that the Narrator doesn't. In order for him to
develop
these skills without the Narrator's knowledge, he needed substantial
lengths
of time when the Narrator was asleep. The Narrator therefore could not be
insomniac; he should have been a narcoleptic, falling asleep
unaccountably -
or being unable to account for long periods of time - when &quot;Tyler&quot; was
developing.
