1999_November 14 

As with so many other big films, there are too many comments for mine not
to
be lost in the mass, so I'll try to be brief.<br /><br />The film contains many platitudes about self-realisation, all of which
we've
heard before, but it sites them in a context so raw and vivid that they
emerge fresh, and thereby communicate themselves to the viewer so directly
that they become more powerful, more compulsive. If the film finally runs
out of steam - because once you're on the destructive rollercoaster, you
can't stop until it crashes - its early sequences provide a hard-hitting
(no
pun intended) and yet stylish approach to the vacuity of modern life (I
particularly like the deconstruction of Ikea, as the proud owner of an
Ikea
futon).<br /><br />I wrote a novel last year in which the main character, frustrated with the
emptiness of his life, is drawn by a somewhat insane other character into
more and more extreme behaviour. Having seen Fight Club, I can safely tear
up my manuscript, because Fincher and Uhls have conveyed the same message
much more powerfully than I was able to.<br /><br />Fincher's direction may suffer from occasional gimmickry, but even the
most
apparently gratuitous moments are not without purpose. And Uhls's script
is
beautifully constructed. This is one of those rare films in which the
voice-over technique really works.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie is about subversion - not just against social
norms,
not just against the bourgeois mindset, but even against cinema itself (as
shown by the overt subliminal imagery). It's so good to come across
something so genuinely radical, with the cinema now over a hundred years
old. Good, too, that it came out of a major studio. And good, let's not
forget, that this film is extremely funny.<br /><br />Come on, hit me, you know you want to...
