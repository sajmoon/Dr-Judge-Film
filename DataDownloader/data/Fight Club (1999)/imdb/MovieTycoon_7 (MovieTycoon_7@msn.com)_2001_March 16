The second I walk into the theater I knew I wasn't going to see a
shoot-um-up action movie. This is what I saw. A movie that describes what
everyone is thinking but is afraid to say. Fight Club was dissed by critics
but twenty-years from now the will be on their knees begging for forgiveness
because this will go down in history as the greatest film ever made. You may
not think so but trust me, I know what I'm talking about. If you have a
problem with it the e-mail me.
