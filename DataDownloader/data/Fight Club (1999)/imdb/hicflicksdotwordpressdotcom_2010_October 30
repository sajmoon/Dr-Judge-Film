Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br /><br />I am a big fan of the director of this movie, David Fincher. I have
seen his earlier flicks viz. Seven and The Game, and was awed by the
gritty &#x26; surreal but yet classy direction style of Fincher. This flick
too came across as a hard &#x96; hitting, in-your-face kind of movie, with
an ending that will blow your mind. I especially liked the fighting
scenes, accompanied by its thumping music, that immediately put you
into the mood to take a blow at someone . So I guess this movie won&#x27;t
be the ideal one to watch (or snuggle to) with your girl friend. Rather
watch it with your buddies and have a wild time.<br /><br />This flick is ideally suited for those who want to de-stress from their
busy work lives. Its in your face and gritty, so not suited for the
pretentious types. So watch it and get all CHARGED UP &#x85;&#x85; Wooo &#x96; Hoooo!
