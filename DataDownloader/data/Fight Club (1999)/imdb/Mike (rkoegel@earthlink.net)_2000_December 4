Clever doesn't begin to describe how ingenious this film is.  The saddest
thing is that most people who haven't seen it, but have just heard about it,
are going to misinterpret it as just another brainless &quot;man&quot; movie. But it's
much more complex than that.  If you haven't seen it (you'd have to be from
Outer Space), see it, and if you've seen it, SEE IT AGAIN!  I have
spoken.
