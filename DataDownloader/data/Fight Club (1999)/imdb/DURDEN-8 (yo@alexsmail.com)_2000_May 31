This is the kind of movie that when it ends your not really sure what to
think about it but after a couple of days you totally love it and want to
see it over and over again.
Seeing Fight Club is an experience totally new for everybody, there is no
other movie like it and there will never be, not until i&acute;m guessing 10
years more. Because thats the time it&acute;s gonna take (i hope) to people to
understand the movie and really understand it.
If students of film making are now studying Kubrick i&acute;m sure they will
study
David Fincher in the future.
Fight Club has great speed, in dialogues and actions, it has a great cast
(even Meat Loaf was good) and most important it was deep, so deep that
nobody notice it was deep because the deepiness of Fight Club is beyond
tears and silences like the usual deep movies.
If you don&acute;t know what movie to watch, rent Fight Club, if you already saw
it and didn&acute;t like it, rent Fight Club
