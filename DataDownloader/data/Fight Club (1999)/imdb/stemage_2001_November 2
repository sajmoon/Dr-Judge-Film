I hate going to the movies.  I hate Hollywood and what they do to movies to
make them appeal to people who don't like movies.  It's sad.  Just a
disclaimer.  Fight Club is my favorite movie of all time.  Every movie has
it's flaws, but I just can't find any here.  The cinematography is unmatched
with hokeyless use of FX, the acting is perfect, the writing is top notch
taken from a top notch novel by a top notch author (Chuck Palahnuik, read
Survivor), the story leaves you with the feeling of coming down from a large
trip.  Truly an emotional, confusing, yet satisfying experience.  A
masterpiece.  Every line in the movie is quotable!!  People who trash it,
don't like this type of movie, and that's fine, it's not for everyone.  But
still, for what it is, simply perfect.
