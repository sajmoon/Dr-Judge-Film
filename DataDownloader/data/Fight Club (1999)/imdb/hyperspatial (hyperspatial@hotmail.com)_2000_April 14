I don't mean to be hyberbolic. I don't like hyperbole. But this is simply
the greatest film I have ever seen in my life. I think that, literally,
*everyone* should see this film. If you don't like it, good. If you hate
it,
great. If you love it, even better. Regardless, seeing this film is
beneficial for your mental health, either as a way of seeing the world in a
new light or as a confirmation of your earlier views. Thanks for listening
to my rant. Peace.
