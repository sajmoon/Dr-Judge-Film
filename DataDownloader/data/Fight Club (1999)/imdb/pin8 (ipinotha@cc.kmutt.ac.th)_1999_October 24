1999_October 24 

Three times.  That's how many times I went to see this movie.  I have to
admit that I was not interested in it at first.  I read some reviews and I
thought it was just one of those violent type of film.  The only reason I
went to see this movie was I wanted to see Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />Then once the movie started, I knew right away I was making a right
decision..  The movie makes you think about some simple things around you..
you know.. like, who you are and where do you stand in the society.<br /><br />But the first rule is that you do not talk about Fight Club... so I am not
going to say more.<br /><br />For those of you who feels that you are not free to do whatever you want
because of ...whatever.. this is the movie for you.<br /><br />It's time to wake up and look around .....<br /><br />Free yourself.
