Fight Club is a great film that stands up to repeated viewing, and
actually
gets better the more you watch it.  In fact, I recommend watching it at
least twice to catch the double meaning in a lot of the dialogue and to
understand all the characters' motivations.  I showed this to my Parents
and
they hated it, but they couldn't get past the violence to see the meaning
behind the story.  Edward Norton also mentioned that many of the critics
who
raved about 'The Graduate' (a great movie as well) panned 'Fight Club'
despite the fact that the central themes are similar.  Both movies are
about
someone pigeon-holed into society's view of how their life should be, and
finding some way to break free of that while at the same time realizing
what
is important to them.  Where 'The Graduate' takes a more conventional and
easy to follow path 'Fight Club' goes more cerebral and psychological path
to about the same end.  Not only that, but the performances are fantastic,
the direction and cinematography are excellent, and the writing is not
only
witty (sometimes down right hilarious and very quotable in everyday life)
but also tight and magnificent.  I actually enjoyed the film more than the
book.
