Can't think of much to say about this that hasn't been said. But after
trying to think of the words for over three years now, I decided just to say
it's the only film i've seen that i'd give 10.5/10. Manages to be faithful
to and different from the novel at the same time. Let's have another movie
of a Palahniuk novel, soon...
