I've been looking over the reviews for Fight Club for about fifteen minutes,
and just wanted to say that I agree with the overwhelming majority of people
who have posted reviews for this film, that Fight Club is an amazingly
well-constructed, well-conceived film that blows my mind away every time I
watch it.<br /><br /> For those of you who have been fortunate enough to read the book, that's
awesome, you know what I'm talking about.  For those of you who haven't, GO
GET IT.  The book, which came out before the film, goes almost hand-in-hand
with the film, and gives even more depth into the already thickly developed
and colorful characters in this dark, gritty satire.<br /><br /> For those who have attacked this film as a flaky attempt to make a
statement of discouragement and anger- you obviously don't know what those
things are.  Nor can you even relate or try to sympathize.  Logic in anger
is like lace on a bowling ball; it just doesn't belong, and you won't ever
find it.<br /><br /> Edward Norton plays his character (WHO HAS NO NAME, contrary to many
people's belief that it is Jack...) with a sharp wit that is sorely lacking
in most films of any genre.  Brad Pitt is the perfect nemesis/sounding board
for a man on the verge of completely losing himself into the void of rage.
Helena Bonham Carter was the perfect vision of already having found 'the
bottom' and turning inward on one's self to finish off the job.  I can't
think of a better way to have done this film, and I believe anyone who
thinks they could have done better is either a fool, a liar, or both.<br /><br /> To finish off this rambling spew of joy upon this film, I STRONGLY
recommend  seeing this film to anyone who is open enough with their feelings
to handle being uncomfortable.  Contrary to what some people think, it is
actually a good thing to force yourself into areas that you may not be
comfortable doing, if for no other reason than to find out about your own
true self.<br /><br />
