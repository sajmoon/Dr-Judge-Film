This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  with a terrific cast
especially the standout performance of Helena Bonham Carter in a movie
fueled by the male instincts.  The story is like no other written before
for
the movies however the original Fight Club Novel does beat it. Norton is
his
usual self with a great performance and delivering lines, I have gained
respect for Pitt after this movie and he is on my list of good actors. and
as for the director, Finchers style is so beautiful and unique, especially
the opening scene.  even the music is great.  A movie for all people not
just men, however you must watch it at least twice to appreciate  its
humor
and intellect. I urge you if have not seen this to go and rent it, also
use
the DVD and play the commentarys by Novel Writer Palahniuk  and the cast
commentary.  this movie is a ten out of ten and deserves a lot more then
it
was given.
