The movie speaks for itself. Its the greatest of all time. Anyone who
disputes this obviously does not comprehend or understand the film in its
true glory. This is the one film I can watch thousands of times and never
get sick of it. Which to me indicates that no other film can be anywhere
near this beauty. One Billion out of ten.
