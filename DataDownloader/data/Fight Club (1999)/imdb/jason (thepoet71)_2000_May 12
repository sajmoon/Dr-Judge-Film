Wow. This movie is amazing. It has taken the number one spot of my favorite
movie. It is a huge reality check, and it clicks perfectly with me. Brad
Pitt is excellent. Edward Norton is great. this is by far the best movie
i've seen. Director David Fincher does excellent work. I recommend this
movie to anyone who wants to see a dark reality.<br /><br />
