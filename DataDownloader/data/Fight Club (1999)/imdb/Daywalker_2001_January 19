It is always said, that the 90s were &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Trainspotting&quot;,but
in my opinion &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the most important film of the last decade
(nevertheless, the two others are brilliant movies,too!). &quot;Fight Club&quot; shows
in a forceful way, how life becomes existence and existence becomes
meaningless, because of the total lost of the own identity. We praise
television and advertising, money is our god, but we become more and more
faceless beings. In the case of the narrator (Edward Norton) it leads to a
split personality, schizophrenia, and the result of that is Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt). A charismatic and dangerous anarchist. Together (although they
are one and the same person!) they establish the fight club. And in this
unity all these shattered existences get what them makes feel that they are
real: Pain! It&acute;s the best therapy that they can&acute;t get anywhere else. After a
while, Tyler plans the total overrun of society. And the narrator finds
himself trapped in the net of his own conspiracy...
What can I say more about this movie: David Fincher&acute;s direction is excellent
(although the film has got some length, but who really cares?!?), the score
of the &quot;Dust Brothers&quot; is also great, camera handling and atmosphere are a
fabulous mixture between video clip and film noir. Brad Pitt, who is still
too underrated as an actor, is the stated star in this movie, but Edward
Norton&acute;s performance had deserved an oscar! (10/10)
