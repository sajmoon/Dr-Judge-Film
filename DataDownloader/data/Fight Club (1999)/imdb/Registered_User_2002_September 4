Fight Club is an awesome film and anybody who denies that is lying. I
loved the idea of going to support groups for ailments you don't have;
unfortunately I came up with that idea a long time ago on my own. Damn.
On another note: Brad Pitt isn't on the same aesthetic level as the
supreme Mr. Redford, but he'll do. I also enjoyed Edward Norton's role
because he's so typical I think of a lot of people out there who hate
their lives to a point of delusion.<br /><br />I recommend Fight Club to most everybody (except maybe old women,
Catholic priests, people who don't like gratuitous sex, people who
don't like gratuitous violence, people who can't understand English,
small children *especially those who don't like gratuitous sex and
violence or cannot understand English*, the romantic comedy crowd, my
mother, and hippies).
