Ah, the Fight Club. This movie is a porno flick with good acting. It is
unbelievable. The idea of the story is not the most original thing, but that
isn't what matters. This movie made me feel things no other 'I hate my job'
film ever did. Maybe it's Ed Norton, maybe it's David Fincher, maybe it's
all of it. If you are a much too average person like myself, this movie will
hit you like a ton of bricks, if you let it.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I felt content with being myself. I could breath
freely, and accept being just like everyone else. We really do all want to
be rock stars, and the truth is we can't. We all work jobs we hate for sh*t
we don't need, hell, I still do it even after seeing the movie (although I
cut down dramatically). Now, rather than wishing I was Brad Pitt, I wish I
was Tyler Durden.<br /><br />From what I hear I am of the minority of people who watched this movie and
fully understood it the first time, but even then, I watch it over and over
again. If you have not seen this movie, go see it; NOW! Just remember, it is
a movie, and it is there to entertain. Don't go joining a fight club and
blowing up buildings. That is why they made the movie, so the need to do
that would go away. Anyways, I give this move a 10, only because that was
the limit.
