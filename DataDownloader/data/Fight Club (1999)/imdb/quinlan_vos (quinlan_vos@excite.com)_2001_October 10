I'd never heard of the novel and unfortunately I didn't get around to
seeing
this film until it had hit video.  Even then I wasn't sure what I was
getting into.  I almost didn't rent the film as I was not the world's
biggest Brad Pitt fan at the time.  On the recommendations of many of my
friends, however, I finally broke down and shelled out $2.50 for Fight
Club.<br /><br />That was the best damn $2.50 I have ever spent.<br /><br />Fight Club, while not a film that everyone will appreciate, is definitely
a
unique and amazing experience.  The visual and narrative style are fast,
edgy and furious and totally fit the story.<br /><br />Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Brad Pitt deliver top notch
performances.  Plus, the big revelation (which I won't spoil for anyone
who
has yet to experience this film for the first time) came totally out of
left
field and knocked me upside the head.<br /><br />Fight Club isn't your average film, and due to the style and subject
matter
it might take more than one viewing to truly appreciate it...but it is
definitely worth the effort.
