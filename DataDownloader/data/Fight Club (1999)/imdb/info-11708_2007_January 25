Please stay away from this film if you dislike blood or sexual
references and feel movies should be happy go lucky and about being a
good person! Howver...if you like films that show the tough dark side
of our human existence...run to see this film! Brad Pitt was amazing as
was the always great Ed Norton! This was a well cast film with everyone
delivering top notch performances! You gotta love the special editing
also! Look for quick flashes of images in the beginning as it is a clue
to what is going on! I also loved the fight scenes and understand they
are not about pure brutality but also about men frustrated with their
existence and yet needing an outlet of male repressed aggression which
could lead all of us men into what happened here f we don&#39;t honor our
masculine sides!
