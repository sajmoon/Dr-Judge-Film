2000_January 9 

What began for me as an action movie with senseless violence soon became a
dogma for living. I walked into fight club with low expectations and yet
walked out a new person. Forget for a second the anarchial nature of the
film (which most of the female population focus upon) and see it as a
Scream
for Help from late 20th Century Males. Every single one of my mates related
to it in their own way, and all of us feel the supression and depression
felt by the main character Edward Norton (American History X, Rounders) who
played the role with detailed intricacy.  Brad Pitt, was at his usual best,
delivering the role of Tyler Durden with high intensity.  Without giving
too
much away, I will simply conclude by saying that Fight Club will be
analyzed, scrupulized and moralized in future generations and best explains
the social and mental state of the Males from the late twentieth
century.
