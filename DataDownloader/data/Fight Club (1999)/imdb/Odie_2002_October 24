Easily one of the greatest films of all time, and by far my favorite of
some
millions films I've seen. In this pre-apocalyptic dark comedy, Tyler
Durden
(Brad Pitt) and his weary friend (Edward Norton) lead an all male
revolution
against the male stereotype, consumerism, and the world in general with
their own form of George Carlin style terroism. That is until
suicide-obsessed Marla comes to ruin the day with either man after her,
or
her after either man.  Brilliantly directed and shot, and with the most
superb performances from all three leads.  Completely worth the viewing,
if
you have a great sense of humor.
