Definitely, one of the best movies ever. The plot, the book, the music,
and,
certainly, the two main actors ( Norton and Pitt) play at they best. In my
country, it was a short time on the cinemas, but whoever saw it had the
best
comments on it. I won&acute;t say the plot - it is already summarized - you have
to EXPERIENCE it to know  how this movie is at the very top of the 250 top
movies.
All I can say is I saw it on cinema, and I HAD to buy it on VHS first,
and,
a friend of mine on DVD. Truly, a work of art. Don&acute;t miss
it
