The reason criticisms of this film are misguided is simple: they center
around a dislike for the use of violence and a general antipathy to the
perceived messages of the film. Critics of the film will argue that the
themes of the film center around nihilism, sadism, and a general lack of
respect for modern social constructs.<br /><br />An adequate rebuttal will deny none of this as the movie does wear its
intentions quite on its sleeves. But then again the annals of great
literature are surrounded by these themes. Dostoevsky's &quot;Notes from
Underground&quot;, Albert Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; by
J.D.
Salinger to name but a few. Indeed, since the birth of the Industrial
Revolution the conflict between man and the society attempting to
mechanise
him has been a major theme of literature and art.<br /><br />Why does this matter? Because Fight Club is even more relevant now than it
was when it came out in the gogo era of the stock market bubble and the
Millenium madness. The ending of the film, that rampant consumerism will
lead to the buildings falling down around our ears, makes complete sense
in
the context of 9/11 and its aftermath. Osama bin Durden has started his
own
Fight Club and its madness we now face.<br /><br />Fight Club does not condone violence but rather rejects it, or better put,
rejects the fundamental roots of what leads to the violence it presents.
As
the world's resources are destroyed and we become more and more alienated
from nature, the last this we need is more consumerism.<br /><br />All other personal opinions can fall by the wayside. You may not like the
medium but you must at least respect the message. Indeed that message may
be
the most important one America and the world faces as it enters the new
millenium and struggles to deal with its own teeming masses and the need
to
satisfy all of their needs.<br /><br />The last word belongs to Tyler Durden: F**k Martha Stewart!<br /><br />
