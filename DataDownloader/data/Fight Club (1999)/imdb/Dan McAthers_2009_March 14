As odd as it may sound, this film will make you want to fight. It will
leave you gritting your teeth, clenching your fists and wanting to
experience the thrill of fighting (no matter how effeminate you
consider yourself to be). Without being too sexist, i would not
recommend this film for women, but for all of the men out there who
have not yet watched David Fincher&#39;s masterpiece - you need to see it
as soon as possible.<br /><br />Furthermore, beneath the fun outer layer, there are thought-provoking
messages illustrating ideas of consumerism and attacking modern day
society as a whole. It will alter your perspective upon life, which is
something not many films possess.<br /><br />The acting performances also need a special mention, as i can not think
of another film that rivals the acting masterclass shown by both Edward
Norton and Brad Pitt. The two contrasting characters are deranged,
erratic and wonderfully ludicrous all at the same time. Helena Bonham
Carter isn&#39;t too bad either.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
