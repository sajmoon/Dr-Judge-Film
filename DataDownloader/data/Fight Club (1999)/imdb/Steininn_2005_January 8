Fight Club by David Fincher tells the story of a man (Narrator, Edward
Norton) who has almost made his life perfect, has a well-paid desk job,
a nice condo, beloved furniture etc. Despite having an almost perfect
life, he's bored and dealing with insomnia. He fakes cancer and other
illnesses and attends support groups to bound with other people and
soon becomes an addiction. After a while the support groups are
hijacked from him by another faker, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter)
and soon they start splitting up groups. Then he meets Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt), a man who has an opinion that it's better to be free,
alive and chaotic than safe, secure and bored like Norton's character
is. Now, these two personalities start a club, which makes men feel
free and alive. Soon Marla Singer strikes again and now she makes a
love triangle.<br /><br />When I saw this movie I loved it. Well, I saw this movie first thinking
it would only contain violence and a lot of fighting scenes, but by
watching it, I saw that there was more to it. Fightclub contains
excellent acting, great storyline and some good pointers towards life.
I highly recommend those of you that haven't seen it to do it ASAP.
9/10.
