I read the book Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk in one sitting on a rainy
Sunday many months ago.  It is a clever, funny, scary, dramatic story which
I thought would not translate well to the screen.  How wrong can you be?
The movie is as funny, gripping, violent and scary as the book and it has
even retained the power to surprise until the very end.<br /><br />Other users have summarised the plot so you know it already.  The
performances however are something else again.  Ed Norton is one of the
finest living actors and turns in another flawless performance for which he
should have been nominated.  Brad Pitt, who is sometimes brilliant and
sometimes hammy, is brilliant here and balances Ed nicely.  Even Helena
Bonham Carter may have finally shaken her Merchant Ivory image with an edgy
performance as Marla.  And whatever you think about Meat Loaf, I like
seeing
him turn up in a movie!<br /><br />This overlooked movie should at the least have received a few Oscar
nominations, for Ed and the adaptation if nothing else.  Rent this movie.
You will want to buy it to show all your friends.
