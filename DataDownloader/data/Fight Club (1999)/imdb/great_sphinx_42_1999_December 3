1999_December 3 

I am the person who, according to every critic that's reviewed the film and
many random moviegoers, is supposed to not like and not get &quot;Fight Club.&quot; I
am a young American female. And I loved every frame of this movie. I feel
that this year produced a suprising large number of decent to good flicks,
but this has got to be at the top of the heap, or very near it. It reminds
me, more than anything, of &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; Coming from me, that's a
*HUGE* compliment! Sure, it's nihilistic. It's violent. It's sadistically
homoerotic. It's many things, but the truest, most reflective adjective I
can use is that it's genius. Fincher is God, heaving a huge f*cking
thunderbolt of a message at American society in particular. Brad and Edward
are at his right and left sides, the deliverers of that message.
