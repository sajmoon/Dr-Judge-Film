I&#39;m not very good at describing movies. But Fight Club is movie like no
other. Its a movie where you have to constantly pay attention or you
might miss something and not understand the rest of the movie. It took
me two or three times watching it to get the full gist of it. If you
haven&#39;t seen this movie and are looking for something different then
the norm,I highly recommend!!!! If this movie isn&#39;t already considered
and cult classic then it will be once its age increases. I know this
doesn&#39;t really give you any details but this movie is very hard to
explain. It is definitely something you have to watch to understand.
