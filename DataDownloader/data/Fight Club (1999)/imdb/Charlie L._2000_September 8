&quot;Fight Club&quot; is worth seeing for its technical feats. Like &quot;Three Kings,&quot;
it
heralds the digital revolution that really emerged in 1999 and promises (or
threatens, depending on your perspective) to radically alter cinematic
language. But unfortunately, it's mostly style over substance. You'll find
fans here and elsewhere praising the film for its message, but it's
sometimes hard to tell what &quot;message&quot; they're talking about. Is it the
rather easy attack on consumerism? The constant griping about lost
machismo?
The thread of generational conflict? All these underdeveloped ideas are
simultaneously celebrated and undercut by the film, especially as the
&quot;fight
club&quot; phenomenon started by Tyler Durden/The Narrator spins out of control.
Are we to accept anything that comes out of Tyler's mouth? Or are we to see
through his rants as the product of a muddle-headed (and maybe crazy)
wannabe culture critic? By the time the film's twist becomes clear, its
story and philosophy have become so jumbled that everything falls apart.
We're left with an impressively made movie without any real heart or soul,
as empty as the consumer culture it supposedly critiques. (I can't help but
note the fact that this is a big studio, big budget movie with big money
stars and a big ad campaign. How sly that it in the end it props up the
culture that gave it life.) It's a screen on which angry young men can
project their pet obsessions, but for the rest of us it's hollow.
