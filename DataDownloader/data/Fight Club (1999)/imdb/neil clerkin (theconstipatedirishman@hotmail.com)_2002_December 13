jack is a corporate drone who has everything and most people in his
situation would be content. but he lacks fulfillment and his sick of
todays
modern corrupt and routine based world.  his tortured lifestyle causes him
insomnia and it seems he can't break free. untill one day he meets tyler
durden an anti-capitalist, anarchist who who shares jacks views but in a
more sadistic way. they form fight club, an underground way for men to
unleash there fury and the pressure they are building up. fight club
gradually becomes bigger and bigger and becomes project mayham. a
revoloution against industries and the authority of todays
society.<br /><br />this film was controversial for its violence but its essential for the
story, and when tyler (brad pitt) p***es in the soup of the rich and sells
extracted body fat back to them in the form of soap your either thinking
thats morally wrong or if you have an ounce of rebellion in you your
cheering him on.there is a dark humour and a dry wit to add to the bleak
atmosphere. anyone who questions todays world should watch this. any
communists left in the world should watch this. anyone who is getting
board
with routine should watch this. and anyone who can't stand the violence
and
graphic nature should read the equally good book.<br /><br />no doubt this is david finchers best film (he directed se7en)and along
with
the matrix and american beauty ( which is surprisingly similar)this is the
one of the best films of 1999. *****
