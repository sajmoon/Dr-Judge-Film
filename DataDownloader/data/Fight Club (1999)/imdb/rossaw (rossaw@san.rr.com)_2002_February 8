2002_February 8 

This movie is too graphically and personally violent (and the violence goes
on too long), the squalor is too squalid, the grit too gritty, the plot too
twisted, and the message basically retarded. But it's a truly great flick,
especially if you can appreciate it for what it is. It's a rant. One doesn't
take rants seriously, one appreciates them for style, vigor, angst, and in
fact for their very absurdity itself. The spirit of the rant is Quixotic,
it's &quot;we're not going to take this anymore&quot; when you know perfectly well
you're going to take it more and then some. You're leaving rational
discussion behind. You're banging your head against the wall to prove you
really mean it. <br /><br />It's fantasy, like all good movies. We, the rational and reasonable
audience, are allowed to vicariously go over the edge, and we shall be
brought back, by some means -- don't worry -- and don't complain (you got
back didn't you?). Meanwhile one enjoys the release from reason. &quot;Just let
go!&quot; Durkin says to the narrator at one point. That's what this movie is all
about, the fantasy of letting go. Perhaps some people feel threatened by
this, because they're so bottled up they might wonder if they're headed up
on some roof somewhere with a telescopic rifle. Don't worry, all of us know
somebody we'd like to kill, or, say, punch really hard. Admit it! This movie
speaks to that, but don't forget, it's only a movie. Brad Pitt is a consumer
product, this movie is a consumer product and a good one. People reacting to
the content of the argument miss the point -- a fact iteratively stored
within the plot itself.  <br /><br />Fantastic direction especially.
