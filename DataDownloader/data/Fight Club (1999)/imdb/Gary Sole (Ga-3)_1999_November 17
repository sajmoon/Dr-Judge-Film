Fight Club was nothing like I was expecting.  I think based on the name I
was expecting something more like Blood Sport.  It does not concentrate on
fighting and who is the best but more on the freedom, release and desire
of
a man to fight.
It is about a strange friendship that helps liberate a man from the
regular
bonds of life.  The formation of the fight club leads to bigger and
grander
schemes - all aimed at trying to free men in general from their normal
passive responsibilities.  The club has a powerful far reaching
affect.
I think it is a very clever movie and introduces things I have never seen
in
any other movie.  It was refreshingly different.
