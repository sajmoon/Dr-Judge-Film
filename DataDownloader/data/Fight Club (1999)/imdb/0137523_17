After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm.
Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's
not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it
for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the
conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a
totally
different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack
performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind'
by
the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight
Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best
reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed
Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the
villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is
just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.
