The first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club.
But in this case, I can&#x27;t help but break that rule.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re looking for a happy, all-is-well film, you&#x27;d better turn
around and walk away. Right at the beginning, the film kicks off by
introducing an intense situation, and it only goes downhill from there.
Immediately the audience is hooked and wants to know more. From the
title, many people assume that this movie is all about fighting, and so
they discard it, but it&#x27;s really about much more than that.
Consumerism, anti-sociality, and sociopathic behaviours are covered and
supplement the film nicely.<br /><br />An insomniac is the center of this film. Norton plays this insomniac,
who also happens to have an everyman job, everyman boss, and basically
an everyman life. What&#x27;s not to like? Although we don&#x27;t get this
information right away, it does shape the basis for the film. He loves
his home and his furniture, but soon his life turns upside down.<br /><br />The characters are witty and clever. Norton&#x27;s character&#x27;s voiceovers
come at just the right moment, supplementing the dark moments of the
film with humour, and Brad Pitt&#x27;s character is anything but a cardboard
cut-out. They both evolve, along with Helena Bonham Carter&#x27;s character,
at a good pace, which keeps the audience constantly interested. Still
on this topic, the acting and portrayal of the three main characters is
superbly done; in my opinion, the best was Edward Norton. Genuine
surprise, guilt, and overall acting.<br /><br />All in all, Fight Club is definitely a film to check out.
