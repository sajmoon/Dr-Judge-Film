I actually can't believe that people hate or even dislike this film, because
for me it's one of the best of all time!! I think this film is very clever
and is full of some brilliant and pitch black comic moments(Like when the
guy trys to start a fight with a priest!!) The acting in this film is
nothing short of outstanding, Norton is excellent and Pitt delivers a 5 star
preformance!!<br /><br />So take it from me, check this film out!!!
