While many movies of Fight Club's domain still reaches for a Usual Suspects
type ending. Fight Club goes for something interesting and new. A spectacle
of a crazy man's plight as he tries to get rid of his evil side. Besides
the
great script this movie is pushed to genius status through the incredible
work of the main actors Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and especially Helena Bonham
Carter.
