Fight Club is unlike anything you have ever seen. It is at a dark comedy,
a
social commentary, a twisted love story, and finally a total assualt to
your
senses.  Edward Norton plays the narrator, a biting commentary on the
facelessness of our society. He is suffering from insomia when he starts
to
go to self help groups.  The groups help him sleep.  Helena Boheim Carter
plays Marla a fellow support group faker whom the narrator
despises.
When we meet Tyler Durden we know he's trouble.  Tyler comments on how the
proper mixture of OJ and gasoline will make Napalm.  Durden is brilliantly
played by Brad Pitt, he plays Durden as a sadistic anarchist, who believes
society should de-evolve from its friendly nature.
Tyler and the narrator form Fight Club, a club that the basic goal is to
beat the crap out of one and another.  It is a brutal club based on a idea
of infinite freedom.  The club slowly evolves into a sick little militia
called Project Mayhem. The rest of them movie is a sick little game
between
Tyler and the Narrator.  The end result being the stunning truth about
their
relationship.
Fight Club is ingenious and it isn't for everyone. The movie is bizzare
and
shocking it is twisted and brilliant.  The movie is one stunning twist
after
another and it is a testament to Finchers genius.  This is a fantastic
movie
and I would recomend it to everyone.
