Fight Club opens my Top 25 movies. When it was in cinemas ( about November
1999 ) I did not see it, I thought that I would hate it. When I was in the
states last year I saw it on video, and wanted to dislike it. But I just
could not. Although I fall asleep about half way through the film, I thought
it was really good. So I watched it again about one month later, when I was
back in Germany, and loved it. I am a guy, and 17 years old, so I maybe am
supposed to like this film, and it is very good. It might be a bit
confusing. I think this is aside The Sixth Sense, Toy Story 2 and American
Beauty, Blair Witch Project and American Pie the best movie of 1999. 1999
was a good year for film making, there were a lot of good/great movies, this
is one of them. <br /><br />I do not like Brad Pitt that much, and even Edward Norton is not one of my
favorite actors. But both of them did a good job in this flick. My favorite
part of Fight Club was the scene where Brad Pitt explains the rules of Fight
Club to the others. That was great. <br /><br />Good points about Fight Club : acting, directing, story, style, SOUNDTRACK,
actors<br /><br />Bad points : also style ( sometimes it is just stupid )<br /><br />All in all, I rated Fight Club 9.5/10 and recommend it to everyone between
10 and 35. <br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. <br /><br />CU; Rinho.
