1999_October 6 

The Fight Club is a movie that makes you want to run out of the theatre,
drink, smoke a lot, and punch your friends in the face.
In a good way.  Big claps to Jim Uhlis for the script, David Fincher for
the
direction, and the entire cast.  For a movie to begin with extreme tension,
tell a rocking good story and then peak beautifully at the end is a rare
thing.  If there is a God, this should clean up at the Oscars.  Black,
wicked, packed with eminently quotable lines- this is one to see AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE, so you're the person who knows what The Fight Club is about, and
not the person hearing endless retellings of the best bits.  One Fight Club
makes up for Three Thomas Crowne affairs.
