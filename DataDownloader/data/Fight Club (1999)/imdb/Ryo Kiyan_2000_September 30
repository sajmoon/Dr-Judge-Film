2000_September 30 

This is hardly the dumb martial arts flick I was expecting.  The film I can
compare it most to is Terry Gilliam's 1985 comic fantasy nightmare, Brazil,
except it's even better.  It's all about life spiraling out of control--an
individual's life, a society, a civilization, maybe even God himself.  That
Fight Club seems to have earned the accolades of both nihilists and
moralists, as well as repelled others of both stripes, is a testament to its
even-handedness.  Underneath its absurd viciousness, there's a truth to the
desperation it sees in the lives of ordinary men who find themselves cogs in
the Machine, men who yearn to tear it all down.  But if there's sympathy for
their taste for manly struggle, for the pungent reality of blood in their
mouths, and their misty dreams of a Kaczynskiesque hunter-gatherer caveman
utopia, there's also no doubt about the dark roads down which such formless
rage will lead, where jack-booted armies and madness are the only rewards
for despair.  And the real answer might have been under a man's nose all
along.  It's a great film.
