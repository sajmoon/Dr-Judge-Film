wow what a movie ! if i was asked which movie is the best i ever saw
certainly it will be Fight Club . it was like you were seeing life
through a tight hole before this movie,after the film ended i just
stayed astonished for about 5 minutes. although the end was not sot of
my type but i kinda liked it .<br /><br />many of my friends who saw the movie explained the end uniquely. the
way Tyler 'brad Pitt' collected all his followers ,alerts the viewers
of how can a man get the people to follow him to mad things as many
examples we see around the world .<br /><br />i really liked the way Pitt got fully immersed into his role , and the
script is so exciting (you can never expect what's coming next !)<br /><br />awady
