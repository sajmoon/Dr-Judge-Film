If anyone has been paying attention to American media culture in the last 5
years or so, Fight Club is an amazing wake-up call.  I have not looked at
the world in the same way since seeing this film.  I cannot watch certain
commercials on TV anymore without flashing back to the film's messages.  No
wonder none of the major award franchises even gave this film a nod - it is
much too radical, much too reality-based (ironically), much too confronting.
In other words, everything they don't want to deal with.  The acting was
great (ok, Norton is a demi-god at least), the script tight, the
cinematography a wild sensuous ride.<br /><br />For a film dealing with similar concepts, American Beauty is milk toast in
comparison.
