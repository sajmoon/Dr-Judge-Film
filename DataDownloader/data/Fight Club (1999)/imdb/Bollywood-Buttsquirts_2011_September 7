Fight Club is a direct lift from Bollywood&#x27;s Dil Chahta Hai (1998).
After Fincher&#x27;s previous flop The Game, he needs to say &#x27;Oops&#x27; this
time again as this movie is already out on DVD. Performance apart,
although a lot of people might not have seen &#x27; Dil Chahta Hai&#x27;, Fight
Club can be described as a good effort in portraying &#x27;Khauf&#x27; on screen.
The suspense is carefully built through the story. The final let-off
however, comes with a badly scripted and shoddily executed ending. The
movie wouldn&#x27;t have cost much considering the second rung star-cast
with the exceptions Brian Pitt and others. Music is listless and the
songs are irrelevant.
