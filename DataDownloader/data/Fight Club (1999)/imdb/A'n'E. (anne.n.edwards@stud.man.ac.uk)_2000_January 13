The first rule of Fight Club is, DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB.  It is also
the second rule. I'm all for some serious rule changes because Fight Club
is
one of those films everyone should see and everyone will talk about. &quot;What
the hell?&quot; and &quot;Why on earth?&quot; will be your watchwords after viewing this.<br /><br />Fight Club is the 'creative outlet' of Ed Norton (insomniac support group
junkie) and Brad Pitt, (mysterious, enigmatic soap maker) whose
partnership
comes about through their disaffection with their lives.  They find
like-minded menial workers who join them in the taste for punching seven
shades of shluck out of each other and then decide to bring the world they
feel has abandoned them to its knees.<br /><br />As with all the works of the now famed 'mess with your mind' director,
David
Fincher  Fight Club is far more than this.  The plot moves along swiftly,
using nice slick frames and sharp, funny dialogue to get on to what the
fights (the violence keeps the film cooking but isn't overdone) and
essentially, life is really about.<br /><br />Some will feel for all the pretty asides, (Meatloaf's breasts) Fight Club
is
too dark and that the ending is just plain weird and unreal. Fightclub's
unreality is sharp and places blame for our oh-so-shallow society squarely
on the shoulders of the corporate fascists who tell us how we should live.
This is done with clever cocksure swaggering irony considering Fightclub
is
brought to us on the very medium most responsible for popular images. Not
that I advocate we all take up arms against Hollywood, but I love a film
that asks explosive questions and seeks to pour nitroglycerine on the
answers, the heat that comes off is very entertaining.<br /><br />Give Schizophrenia a chance. This film is not a &quot;beautiful and unique
snowflake&quot; but it's a snowflake nonetheless.
