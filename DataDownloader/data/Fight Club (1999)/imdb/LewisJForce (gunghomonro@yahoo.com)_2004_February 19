A 2 hour pop video from the dreaded Fincher which employs all the sound
and fury it can muster to signify nothing.<br /><br />Yet another attack on the petit-bourgeois by a resolutely
petit-bourgeois mentality that attempts to diffuse its myriad
contradictions through a tiresomely twisty schizo-personality plot
cop-out.<br /><br />The dialogue breaks down into nothing more than quotable soundbites for
teenage weekend-rebels. &quot;All self-improvement is masturbation&quot;. This
from a film-maker (and I use the term advisedly) who's 'style' is the
very essence of cinematic self abuse.<br /><br />Designer nihilism with Brad Pitt. A 'trip-hop' soundtrack. And Helena
Bonham Carter as a kind of Goth Dorothy Parker.<br /><br />Christ. Is this what passes for cool and edgy these days?
