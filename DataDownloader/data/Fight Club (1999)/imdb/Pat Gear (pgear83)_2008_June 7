Undeniably one of the best films of the tremendous cinematic year that
was 1999, David Fincher&#39;s Fight Club is a cultural landmark. Chuck
Palahniuk&#39;s acerbic first novel (and still the best the 5 of his books
that I&#39;ve read) is visualized with Fincher&#39;s stylistic creativity and
the result is a modern classic.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays a white collar stiff, whose life is so nondescript
that he is known only as The Narrator. He acknowledges that he is mired
in shallow consumerism; a slave to the &quot;IKEA nesting instinct.&quot; He is
also an insomniac and can only find catharsis and sleep after sitting
in on 12-step program meetings for dying people. This strategy fails,
however, when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) pulls the same stunt
and ruins the reality that he has found. After an explosion that
destroys the narrator&#39;s apartment, he moves in with soap salesmen and
revolutionary Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, they start an
underground society in which men reject civilization and unleash their
primal urges upon each other.<br /><br />Fight Club is often described as anti-consumerism or
anti-establishment. There are, however, two less talked about ideas
that I take away from it. The first is the conflict between biology and
society. Sitting on a bus, the protagonists see a rather gaudy
advertisement for Gucci underwear. Durden asks derisively, &quot;Is that
what a man looks like?&quot; I would argue that it is the insidious nature
of the consumer culture, that it actually emasculates men by tapping
into their male drives. It is the natural role of the male to be the
hunter/gatherer, so buying things has become the modern incarnation of
this. Another example of this interplay occurs when the narrator
described how his father would leave his family to start a new one
every six years. &quot;Setting up franchises,&quot; says Durden. Interestingly,
the behavior described here does approximate the behavior of human
males, pre-civilization. The short average duration of modern marriages
suggests the hard-wired nature of this behavior. The fight club,
however, is an outright rejection of modern society, in which men revel
in short bouts of non-lethal violence, perhaps as they were meant to.
When these urges are bottled up, it may not be too much of a stretch to
suggest that the result can be wars and genocide.<br /><br />There are also, I believe, religious implications to the fight club and
to Project Mayhem. Tyler Durden&#39;s philosophy seems to be part anarchism
and part determinism, behaviorism and materialism (in the metaphysical
sense; certainly not in the consumerist sense). He is about three parts
B.F. Skinner and one part Henry David Thoreau. It is those facets of
Skinner-type philosophy that are of the most interest to me and that
Durden espouses most fervently. Like any good materialist, he utterly
rejects the notion that human beings have any special worth. He extols
to his followers: &quot;You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are
the same decaying organic matter as everything else... We are all part
of the same compost heap.&quot; Yet ironically, in supposedly freeing his
followers from consumerism, he makes them slaves to his own purposes.
They are shaved to become like the oft-mentioned sacrificial &quot;space
monkeys.&quot; They are removed of their names (this has a very
anti-Christian feel to, since the having of and giving of names by
humans is considered an important gift from God among the most
meticulous followers of that religion). &quot;Sooner or later we all became
what Tyler wanted us to be,&quot; says the narrator. Durden also
expropriates the idea of &#39;hitting bottom&#39; as the beginning of salvation
(the 12-step program is a fundamentally religious construct), further
casting him as a sort of Anti-Christian. B.F. Skinner suggested that
understanding the science of human behavior was the key to controlling
that behavior benevolently. Similarly, Durden exerts control over his
followers for what he believes are good ends. Whatever the merits of
those ends, there is no doubt that Tyler, in some ways, becomes very
much like the corporate fascists he despises.<br /><br />Finally, Fight Club is a definitively &#39;male&#39; movie. This is neither
good nor bad, but it is undeniable. The character of Marla is
entertaining, but almost entirely defined by her relationship to the
two male protagonists. The picture would have almost worked without
her. The idea of castration is presented as a deeply held male fear and
is used skillfully throughout the movie. If we can take one thing away
from this film, it would be the danger of denying the difference in
biology between males and females. Males have a need for some level of
violence and it is important that we have acceptable outlets for it.
Conversely, it is interesting to take note of some of the ways in which
society attempts to homogenize the sexes. Take the idea of &quot;paternity
leave&quot; for new fathers - it&#39;s great in theory and it should certainly
be an option, but I can almost guarantee that it will never become the
norm, because it is a practice that is just so contrary to our deeply
ingrained biological drives. To deny this is the height of naivety and
will do no one any good.<br /><br />Overall, Fight Club makes my top 10 list for superb acting (especially
by Norton, the best American actor of his generation), great humor and
satire and its excellent script, thanks largely to the excellent source
material. To conclude, I&#39;ll quote the deterministic, yet strangely
comforting words of Chuck Palahniuk, from near the end of Fight Club
(the book): &quot;We are not special. We are not crap or trash either. We
just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.&quot;
