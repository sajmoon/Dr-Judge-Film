Wow! That movie was incredible. I really like Edward Norton so that made
it
even better for me. I was very surprised at Brad Pitt's performance. I
thought he did very well. The plot very good too. The way the movie played
out from the beginning to the end was done very well I thought. The ending
was awesome! I don't think that the writers could have done a better job.
I
give it a 10!
