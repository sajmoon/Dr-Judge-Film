Every frame of this movie has meaning. There is no wasted film at all!
I love the use of &quot;first person&quot; voice over from Edward Norton (one of
my favorite actors). This movie has it all, boy finds girl, boy screws
girls head, boy loses girl, boy blows up buildings, boy gets girl but
doesn&#39;t know it! Wow!!! I only watched this movie because I enjoyed
Brad Pitt in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; and, as mentioned earlier, I love Ed Norton.
Anyway, the story threw me for a loop, I thought it would be a bunch of
macho crap about fighting... OK there is some of that, but that does
not even come close to what the movie is all about. If you watch this
movie and don&#39;t put it in your top 10 list, your top 10 list must be
full of musicals.
