David Fincher is the best director ever! I saw this movie four times now. 2
times on special edition DVD. It gets better and better everytime I watch
it. It works best if you are an intellectual viewer and you have an IQ
that's at least above average. The story about an insomniac who has (*clue
to surprise twist*) nine jobs and gets even more fvcked up when he meets a
tourist named Marla Singer. Fast paced. Wonderful. Get the DVD! You'll enjoy
it. Five stars out of five.
