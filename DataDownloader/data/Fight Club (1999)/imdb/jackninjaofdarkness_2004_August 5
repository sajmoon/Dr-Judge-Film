Hey, folks, Fight Club started out as a book. I haven't read it, but
from what I hear, the movie follows the book very closely. So don't
blame Fincher for getting lazy in the second half of the movie and let
it fall apart. He didn't write it. If you think that's what happened,
and if you think it's a bad thing, blame the author of the book.<br /><br />And here's something for the people who think the movie was overly
violent and had an anti-social message.<br /><br />F*** YOU!<br /><br />If I met you in public, I'd try to start a fight with you. You would
realize how rewarding it is to think and act for yourself, outside the
borders and rules of society. And, in the end, you would join my fight
club when I start it (seriously, really, I mean that), and you would
love it.<br /><br />If you don't like people saying what they think and thinking for
themselves, then movie to a fascist nation. I guarantee you that no one
dares to think outside the box or be a nonconformist there. You'd love
it!
