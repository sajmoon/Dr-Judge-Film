Don't let the title of this film fool you - you're in for a rollicking good
time!<br /><br />This is classic, screwball romantic comedy. Those of you who've already seen
it, just imagine the lead roles played by Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and
Meg Ryan, and I think you'll see my point. Sure, it's a little...
different... from &quot;You Gots Mail&quot;, but at it's heart it's just a simple,
funny, quirky little love story. See, it's all about this guy - young guy,
thirty or so - and all he wants to do is hang out with his guy pals and
never grow up. All along, he's completely denying himself of the one thing
he truly needs to get his life on track - the love of a good woman. Guys, I
know you'll relate, and gals, I'm sure you've known a fella or two like
this. It's an old, old story, but somehow David Fincher and crew seem to
breathe new life into it. You'll want to watch this one over and over again,
I guarantee! <br /><br />Invite a date, a spouse, a mistress or a grandparent over this evening and
enjoy it with someone you love!
