This is one of my favorite films of 1999. In the trailers, it appears to
be
some kind of fight movie along the lines of Gymkata. Don't let this fool
you. Fight Club is one of the most clever and entertaining films of recent
years. It succeeds on every level. Everyone I have recommended this film
to
has enjoyed it a lot.
