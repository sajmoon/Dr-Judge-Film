&quot;Fight Club&quot; is difficult to watch. It is filled with violence for
violence sake without any redeeming qualities. Norton is a youth
looking for a change of life style at an early age. Pitt plays a vulgar
young man with pure violence on his mind. He infects his contacts with
the same concept of life. Scene after scene is filled with blood and
gore. Most of the violent behavior is purely hand to hand combat as in
real boxing. If the author meant for us to be turned off by the
physicality, then he has succeeded. The pace is frenetic, and the
acting is just as fast. I could not give this cinema a high score
simply because of the dark, depressing mood it exudes without
projecting some sort of uplifting characteristic's.
