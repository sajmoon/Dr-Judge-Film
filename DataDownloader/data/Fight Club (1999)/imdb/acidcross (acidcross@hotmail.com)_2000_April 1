When Fight Club was first released to theaters i was very reluctant to go
see it. I heard from many people that it was confusing and that it made no
sense. They were so wrong. when you watch this movie you have to go in with
an open mind. this movie isn't for the naive you must know how the human
mind works to really enjoy the film. i must say that the film was
great.<br /><br />I won't waste time telling you the plot because there is so much to it i
might give something away but i will comment on the acting. Edward Norton is
by far one of my favorite actors. he play just about anyone and he is very
good in this film. Brad Pitt is in top form in this film. in fact this is
the best thing he's been in since Se7evn. loved his performance. Helen
Bonham Carter was also good as the lone female in the movie. very powerful
performance.<br /><br />The camera work in this film is magnificent and David Fincher i ggive you
much admiration for putting this film together.<br /><br />Fight club is exciting from the begining to the very surprising end. go see
it now. 8 out of 10.
