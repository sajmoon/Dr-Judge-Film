Just a few films (2001:A space odyssey or A Clockwork Orange, for
instance),
let each viewer make his own opinion about the film, and each opinion is
completly different of each other.
I saw this film twice, and I still ask: How many ideas are hidden in a
movie
that gets deeper on every viewing?.
Have you think, for example, that most of people use to have the same
criteria about self-realization (a career, good job, family, and enough
money for the &quot;necessary&quot; material posessions), and that makes
self-realization a hard thing to get?
The movie could be asking you: Wouldn't be easier to get self-realization
doing things that aren&acute;t the conventional &quot;keys of success&quot;? Things
like...
forming a &quot;fight club&quot;, and become a leader for a group of men who are
discovering their basic instinct. None &quot;normal person&quot; likes to be beaten,
but it's easy to get beaten, don't you think? So, if my self-realization
would depend of that, I would be very close to become a succesful man.<br /><br />It's unbelievable, but this is just one of a ton of thoughts that this
movie
generates on my mind.
In my very personal opinion, this unforgettable film is one of the best
movies ever made.
