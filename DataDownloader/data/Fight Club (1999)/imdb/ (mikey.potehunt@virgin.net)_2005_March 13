Fight Club without a shadow of a doubt is an incredible film, but what
intrigues me most about it is not the sharp direction or the hard fight
scenes but more the well written and analysed script. My favourite line
is this, &quot;Now a question of etiquette: As I pass, do I give you the ass
or the crotch&quot; This line is a incredible. The woman blocking Tyler is a
problem in life which must either be faced with the ass or the crotch.
Also the theory that everything on a plane is single-serving is
incredible as it is absolutely true. Watch Fight Club for a clearer
view of life and how it is seen through the eyes of an insomniac, club
addict who is brilliantly played by Edward Norton.
