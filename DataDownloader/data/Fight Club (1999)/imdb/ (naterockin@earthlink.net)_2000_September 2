It's good...........really good.  I'm not kidding you, go out and buy it.
Go ahead, make yourself happy for once in your life.  You got Brad Pitt in
what I think deserves to have been and Oscar contending performance.  Then
there is the ever popular Edward Norton.   Meatloaf is also in this....need
I say more?
