David Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a pretty grubby film.The violence is
extremely graphic and, a lot of the time, totally unnecessary. Seven
minutes
has been trimmed from the film here in Australia - whether by the
Commonwealth censor, or the local distributor, I don't know. What I do
know
is that even in its truncated form, I can understand why it was cut so
heavily. Then again, I saw it on video, and maybe it was the cinema
version
that had the seven minutes removed. Either way, the logic that men can
find
meaning in their lives by beating the crap out of each other, seems
ridiculous to this viewer. If the film follows the book, it's one book I
won't bother reading. And, after watching &quot;Fight Club&quot;, I wish I hadn't
bothered hiring that, either.
