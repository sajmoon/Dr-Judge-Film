Thank goodness for Fight Club. This movie showed me that all movies don't
have to be straight drama, straight comedy, straight anything. They can make
fun of themselves. They can be wacky, intense and violent. They can play
with the surreal and the unreal. The can be hip and innovative and all
around good. From the very first frame I was reeled in. The story and
characters are so great in this movie. They are played and directed so well.
I really could relate to them&#133; uh oh. Then I find out what's really going on
and I think I should check myself into the mental ward. Woo Hoo!  What a
rush! I made all my friends see this movie. Then I bought
it.<br /><br />Mr. Fincher, put down the Madonna videos and step away from the Alien
sequels. You have found your niche!<br /><br />I urge every reviewer: please, please do not give away the end. That's my
take. What's yours?
