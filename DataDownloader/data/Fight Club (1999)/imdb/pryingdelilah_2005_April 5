I first saw Fight Club on a cable channel while getting ready to go
out. I only saw the last 45 minutes or so but even then I knew it was a
terrific movie. That was almost a year ago, but I knew it was a movie I
would love. I just recently saw the entire movie and I was right. Fight
Club is a movie about male bonding and wanting what you can't have,
even if you don't know what it is you want. Edward Norton plays the
Narrator perfectly and Brad Pitt hasn't been better since Interview
with the Vampire. They take a story that performed by other actors,
may've been unrealistic, hokey and senseless and turned it into a
complex, believable creepy masterpiece. It's one of my favorite movies
since Silence of the Lambs. Be assured that you won't mind having to
watch the movie several times before actually getting it all.
