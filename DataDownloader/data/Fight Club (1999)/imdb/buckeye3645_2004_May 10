i enjoyed Fight Club very much. i would recommend it to any and all fans
of
Brad Pitt or Ed Norton, as it provides a nice change-of-pace for, well,
every actor involved in it, as it is quite unlike anything else. both of
these guys have (what i consider, for the most part) excellent taste in
rolls, and these parts prove no exception.<br /><br />also, those interested in unique methods of directing and/or film/sound
editing will really be in for a treat with Fight Club. if you have
recently
become interested in David Fincher's movies, this might be the ultimate
place in which to start checking his work out.<br /><br />very unique, nice work. very, very good.
8.0/10.0 cause nothin' has even been a 10!!! : ) enjoy!
