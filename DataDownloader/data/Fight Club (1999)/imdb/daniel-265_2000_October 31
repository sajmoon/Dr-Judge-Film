Fight Club IS the best film of 1999. It has more meaning than 'American
Beauty,' a better twist than 'The Sixth Sense,' cooler than 'The Matrix,'
better characters than 'Magnolia,' the acting is better than 'The Green
Mile' and the directing is better than 'The Insider.'
David Fincher has proven to be a great director with the masterpiece
'Seven.' However 'Fight Club' shows us how much more skill this director
actually has and that he is not just a one hit wonder. I'm eagerly
awaiting
his next film. Edward Norton excels again as the narrator. Hot off the
heels
from 'American History X,' the actor shows us what a great character actor
he is. The character shows us how much our society is falling apart. His
life is a nightmare. He finds a new meaning to life when he meets Tyler
Durden. Tyler is a crazy and wild guy that loves anti-social behavior and
believes everyone can only truly live once they have lost everything. This
film will have you thinking for days and days. It is an underrated
masterpiece that was rudely ignored at the oscars because it was too
violent. What about all the nudity in 'American Beauty' or all the
violence
in 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although these two films are brilliant, 'Fight
Club' has a little more and it should have had a nomination.
