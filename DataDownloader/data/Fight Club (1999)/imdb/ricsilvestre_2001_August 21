This is what movies are made for, make you think, make you feel alive.
Edward Norton is just magic in is role. Brad Pitt does a very nice job
also.
Fincher claims the status of being one of the most important reference in
modern motion picture. This movie is bigger than life.  &quot;I want you to hit
me as hard as you can&quot;.
