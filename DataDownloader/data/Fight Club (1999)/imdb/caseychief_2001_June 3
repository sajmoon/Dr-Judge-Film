Yes, Fight Club has an amazing twist in it, and that twist did blow me away.
It also starts out strong with Edward Norton, who is one of my favorite
actors, in a therapy group meeting some interesting people.<br /><br />However, as the plot kept rolling, it became too over-the-top for its own
good.  The movie was supposed to be about finding out who the true you is,
but yet all of the &quot;followers&quot; had no personality at all.  They were just
drones, and I didn't buy into the fact that so many people would be involved
in this &quot;Project Mayhem&quot;, without somebody getting a conscience and blowing
the lid off of it.  I call this the &quot;JFK&quot; syndrome, where everybody and
their dog is involved with the conspiracy.  Completely unrealistic, and
movie gets really bogged down with it.<br /><br />The plot twist and the excellent performances by Norton and Pitt were enough
for me to recommend you watch this once.  But in my opinion, this movie was
not nearly good enough to be rated in the top 250 of all time.  Highly
overrated. 6/10
