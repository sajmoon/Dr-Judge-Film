I saw Fight Club, and was thoroughly enjoying it.  I was surprised, a
movie
that was marketed as a your regular fighting movie was actually a smart,
edgy, new movie that kept me entertaining.  However, the ending made no
sense, and seemed out of the blue and unexplained.  The movie had kept me
riveted, so when this happened, it was a major let down.<br /><br />Still, I completely recommend watching it.  It's a smart movie that
deserves
more acclaim then it's received.
