This movie was by far the best movie in years. It pulls you into this
strange world and holds you by the balls and then turns it upside
down.
Brad Pitt's performance is amazing and deserves a definite oscar nod.
This
may be my favorite movie only behind Requiem for a Dream and American
History X which stars Edward Norton who was great in this movie. A fresh
idea and ingenious script mixed with two riveting performances make one
hell
of a film.
