A movie that rants against consumerism but features paid product placement? 
It's dumb to just pick at that point because the film is, in essense,
hypocritical, being a big-budget Hollywood flick that supposedly preaches
against it's very being.  But of course, one could easily argue that it
needed to be what it was to say what it did on such a large
scale.<br /><br />Sorry, I thought it was lame; if anything, it might make some unsuspecting
viewers realize and think about things they might not have before.  But in a
lot of ways, it seemed like it was only discrediting what many people feel
it was trying to say.  So it was either anti-revolutionary or
faux-revolutionary...
