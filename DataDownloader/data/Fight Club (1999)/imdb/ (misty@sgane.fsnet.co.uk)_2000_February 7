If you have not seen this film yet then what are you doing reading this, go
and see it right now!!!  Fight Club is the most original film that I have
had the pleasure to see in a very, very long time.  The story is about a
man
trying to find himself, to see where his life is going.  Is it his own life
he is leading, or a life lead by a consumer society of which most of us are
probably guilty of leading.  Do we really need that new car, house or that
new piece of furniture, the answer is probably no, but yet we buy these
things all the same.  The film explores these ideas in a very unusual
manner, but yet it is very effective in the way in which it is
handled.<br /><br />If you are to see this film which I strongly suggest that you do, do view
it
with an open mind.  Don't avoid it because of it's portrayed violence, the
message behind the violence is one worth standing up to and taking notice
of.  Remember that Fincher wanted this movie to be seen as a black comedy,
which I have to say it is even if it is as black as the
night.
