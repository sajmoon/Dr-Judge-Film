I think that the acting in this movie was superb. The characters within
Chuck Palaniuk's novel are definently some of the most challenging oles that
an actor can take on. This movie went to the lengths it needed to and shied
away from NOTHING that was portrayed within the books. Bravo to everyone
involved in this film. Not to mention that the writing was very well done
and as close to the book as was possible. But I suspect that Chuck Palaniuk
had his hand somewhere in the making of the script. But anyway, great movie
and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a movie that is far
different from the humdrums of modern film. I also recommend this movie to
anyone who is a fan of Chuck Palaniuk's work. This adaptation will NOT
disappoint you.
