Fight Club is a truly bizarre trip through the mind of a disturbed young
man.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what this film was about, but I
did enjoy it.  I enjoyed every crazy twist and turn, every freakish little
humourous moment and the clever directing and sharp acting.<br /><br />The violence was a bit excessive though and I kept wondering how Fight Club
might influence younger viewers.  Thinking back on the film, I do believe it
would have seemed to drag a bit if the violent scenes (i.e. the fight
scenes) had not been added.  I hope this wasn't the main reason they were
put into the film.
