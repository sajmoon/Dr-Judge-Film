2000_July 21 

I was totally impressed by the technique and attitude of this great film.
I
loved how the film was always in motion, I did not at all feel bored
during
the entire show.  A little terrified at the ideas put forth but never
bored.
Pitt was excellent in this film, as was Norton and Bonham Carter.  Though
the was a little hard to follow at times, it was a great flight from
everyday boredom.  This movie has just been put into my favorite
category.
