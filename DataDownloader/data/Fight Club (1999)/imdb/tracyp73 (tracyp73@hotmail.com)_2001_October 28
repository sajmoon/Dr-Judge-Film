2001_October 28 

I have to admit-this is my favorite movie! And no, I'm not a teenage guy
OR a card-carrying member of the &quot;Brad Pitt is a God&quot; Fan Club. I'm 28
years
old (26 when I first saw it) and female. I saw it twice in the theatre and
countless times on home video/DVD. Actually, since the film was first
released on DVD, I went out and bought a DVD player so I did not have to
wait until it was available on video.<br /><br />My instinct is to say that I cannot imagine anyone not liking this film.
However, I understand-it's a dark, anti-social, subversive film. It's not
your typical, run-of-the-mill &quot;Hollywood&quot; movie. It's also one of the
funniest, most well-written, well-acted pieces of cinema I've ever had the
pleasure of viewing. Ed Norton truly was snubbed by Oscar, as was the
writer, director, and cinematographer. It was good to see Brad Pitt get his
hands dirty with this role. I also greatly enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter
(whom I had never really cared for until now).<br /><br />Another huge reason to watch is the unpredictability of it all. I could not
have predicted this film even if I wanted to! Please-if you haven't seen
this movie, give it a chance-you WILL be surprised! In exchange for two
hours of your time and three bucks to rent it, you will have one helluva
ride!
