Fight Club is one of those few movies that joyously defies description.
At once it is repugnantly violent and compulsively watchable. It
switches from pitch black humor to stomach turning mayhem in the blink
of an eye. Fight Club cannot easily be classified into one specific
genre without a great amount of debate. One thing that can be agreed on
is that this piece of film-making is utterly thought provoking and
fascinating. The filmmakers are to be commended for taking the very
complex novel by Chuck Palahniuk and transforming it into big screen
material while maintaining the heart of its chaos and message. Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton are great together and it is evident that they
embraced the spirit of their characters. Their on-screen chemistry is
something to behold. When the twist of the story is revealed, don't be
surprised if your jaw hits the floor. I know mine did. Rarely have I so
enjoyed being totally blown away by a film's ending as I was with Fight
Club. It's bold, gritty, unflinching, and unnerving if you let yourself
get caught up in all the anarchy. This film is definitely not for the
squeamish, but it's not hard to see why it's so well liked by those who
can take it.
