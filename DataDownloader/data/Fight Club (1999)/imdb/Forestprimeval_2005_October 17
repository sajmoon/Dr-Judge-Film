I chose this as the best film I'd ever seen for two reasons: the script
and the acting, both of which are without peer. We've come to expect
greatness from Edward Norton, who can make us gasp with the slightest
change in the blood vessels of his eyeball, but Brad Pitt provides
Norton with the perfect acting foil. This film demonstrates why Pitt
needs better scripts, because it proves he is in the top tier of
American actors. He needs to stop hanging around Clooney (although
after &quot;Good Night and Good Luck&quot; we may all be rooting for Clooney to
get writing and directing Oscars) and start seeking out non-genre
scripts. Working together cemented a close friendship between Norton
and Pitt -- it's a compliment to both to say that they deserve each
other. The movie is hilarious and dead serious and a sharpshooter when
it comes to urban male psychology. I'll bet you can't watch it just
once! You'll want to watch it the second time with the subtitles on,
just to make sure you get all the verbal sorcery. What great dialog!
Some people are afraid of this movie because of the fight scenes, which
are indeed realistic and bloody, but that commitment not to soften or
dumb down the film is completely right and part of what makes this such
an intelligent, watchable, and, finally, a &quot;moral&quot; film that occupies
the ethical high ground without going anywhere near the pulpit. FIGHT
CLUB is one of the high points of 20th century art.
