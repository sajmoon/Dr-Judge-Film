What makes this movie so great is that it is art, it can be interpreted in
many, many ways. Don't believe me? read the reviews on this board. Some
people are going to say that Fight Club is a piece of garbage, with a
shallow message to try to hide the violence. Others take it as a really,
really dark comedy. Others take it as a message about facism, or the
formation of cults. Others take it as a message against corporations and
commercialism. There was even some people who said it was about closet
homophobia. I've never really seen a movie that has spawned so many
interpretations. Everytime I watch it I see it in a new light, or peel off a
layer and find something that I never saw before.<br /><br />All the acting in the film is perfect, why Edward Norton or Brad Pitt didn't
get an award for this is beyond me. The directing by Fincher was terrific, I
could take every shot in that movie, frame it, and put it on my wall. The
comedy was kooky and funny, the violence was disturbing when it needed to
be. The ending was fantastic. There is a penguin in the film. What isn't
there for me to love in this movie?<br /><br />I recommend you ignore the &quot;Oscar worthy&quot; wannabe insightful trite of 1999
such as AMERICAN BEAUTY and BEING JOHN MALCOVICH (both films that start
interesting then flop in my opinion) and go see Fight Club, and be prepared
to have an opinion about it. I am Jack's happy customer.
