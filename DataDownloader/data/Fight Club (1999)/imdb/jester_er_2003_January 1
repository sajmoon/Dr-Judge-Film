Fight Club is clever, provocative, mind blowing, and humorus all rolled
into
one. An amazing black comedy based on the book by Chuck P. and directed by
David Fincher. The cast includes Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham
Carter,
and a cameo appearence by Meatloaf. From start to finish its a long
twisted
road of humor and wit with its anti corporate message. Jack ( Ed Norton)
plays an insomniac absorbed in modern day conviences and designer
furniture.
When Jack visits a cancer support group and meets the big moosie, Bob  (
Meatloaf ),  he suddenly lets go and finds a cure for his insomnia. He
becomes addicted to various support groups and finds sleep every night.
Until Marla ( Helena Bonahm Carter ) ruins everything by showing up at one
of  Jack's support groups. Jack then falls back into insomnia and seeks a
new way out. While traveling on a business trip he meets Tyler Durden (
Brad
Pitt ) one of Jack's most interesting &quot;single serving friends&quot; he has ever
met on an airplane. Tyler makes and sells soap to major department stores
for a living. When Jack  returns to his condo only to find it blowen to
pieces he calls upon Tyler for a place to stay. Soon everything whirls out
of control starting with a basement &quot;Fight Club&quot; and growing into &quot;Project
Mayhem.&quot; The ending will blow your mind, and leave you wanting to view
this
film again. See it twice this week.
