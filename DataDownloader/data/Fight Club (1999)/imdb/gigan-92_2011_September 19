A+ <br /><br />A very unusual movie coming from David Fincher, who recovered quickly
from the massive failure that was &#x22;Alien 3&#x22;. One would hardly assume
that the two films had the same director. This film is based on the
novel by Chuck Palahniuk, which I haven&#x27;t read. However, there are some
very relevant themes here, namely freedom from the rampant materialism
that has consumed this country. Secondly, it begs the question to the
audience if their life has any meaning to it all. It&#x27;s showcased in one
scene where our characters practically kill themselves, and Brad Pitt
says, &#x22;We&#x27;ve just had a near life experience.&#x22; <br /><br />This leads me to the cast which was pretty good. Brad Pitt was the
anarchist Tyler and the character is awesome. Edward Norton is our
unnamed narrator as well as supposed protagonist, and he also does
nicely. Helena Bonham Carter didn&#x27;t play all that pivotal a character
if you ask me, but regardless she plays the role quite well. The whole
movie is filled with this beautiful dark humor and truly
stomach-churning violence. Blend those with the intriguing storyline
and you have a film that in itself is hard to even categorize. There
are also some bizarre, big-budget, shots in the movie, odd for film
that technically wasn&#x27;t in need of too big a budget. They don&#x27;t
distract though, and the photography by Jeff Cronenworth is awesome.
The &#x22;Dust Brothers&#x22; (Michael Simpson and John King) provide a unique
and certainly unusual score, but rightfully so for an unusual film.<br /><br />I highly recommend &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; for a unique and hard-hitting film
experience.
