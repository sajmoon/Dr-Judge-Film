I know this movie is not for everyone, but in my opinion, it's certainly
one
of the best, most original movies to come out in quite some time. I also
think, for a movie that's not really considered a comedy, it's one of the
funniest too. Having read the book, I also feel it's one of the few movies
out there that is actually better than it's written counterpart. This will
be one of those movies that will be heavily referenced, quoted, and even
copied in the comming years. I hope to see more works like this by David
Fincher.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the DVD - Very own-worthy! So much extra stuff, that (like the
Matrix) should be part of any action-film collectors's permanent
collection!
