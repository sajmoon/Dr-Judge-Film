Fight Club is a pitiful movie. Awful. I reviewed it twice already, but those
reviews didn't make sense. I finally nailed what was the main reason I hated
this movie. There are a lot of reasons why. But there are two major
ones.
All Fight Club is a giant, anarchy propaganda &quot;film&quot;. We have laws for a
reason. &quot;Start a fight with someone on a street&quot;. What is that going to
solve? Anything at all? Although the &quot;film&quot; doesn't glamorize violence, it
does show it being used for no reason whatsoever except for a cheap laugh.
Fight Club becomes the epitome of everything that is despises by the end.
Sure, I agree that &quot;things we own end up owning us&quot; but what I don't agree
with the actions that characters do in Fight Club. However, Fight Club would
simply be an awful film it tanked, but the fact that so many people like it
and agree with it is far more disturbing. These people are idiots, more
harmful to society than any Adam Sandler lover you'll ever meet. These are
the same 20-something punks who like anarchy, who think Bush is too
conservtive. (so I can't spell) Why do moms like to go destroy little
videogames that are not harmful at all? Where's the banning of this film?
This film has more negative influence than any violent videogame could
offer. They offer violence as a solution, and millions of people agree. What
a sad day in America...
Now of course, there are the &quot;filmic&quot; (err...) flaws, such as the stupid,
pointless, long monologues and philosophies, and the &quot;hey! Look what I can
do with this cool camera!&quot; direction, and the fact that Brad Pitt couldn't
act his way out of a paper bag, and Helena Bonham Carter adds nothing to the
story, how stupid and pointless the surprise at the ending is, how the film
skips long periods of time, leaving us confused...I could go on.<br /><br />I strongly detest anyone who declares this the best film of all time. This
is nothing. This is just trash. So, email me if you want with your little
gen-x comments and what-not, but one day you'll realize that violence is
never an answer, and rules are enforced for a reason., and then you'll
realize that Fight Club and everything involved is evil! I feel like going
to church now. No stars. Negative stars. Negative 10 stars. I p**s on this.
