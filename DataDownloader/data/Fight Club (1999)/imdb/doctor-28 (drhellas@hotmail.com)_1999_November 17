1999_November 17 

Fight Club is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The story
is
excellent, with both Norton and Pitt putting in some very worthy
performances.<br /><br />For anybody who has not gone to see Fight Club yet, I highly recommend it,
however, the movie takes a wrong turn in the last twenty minutes, and
unfortunately for Fight Club, the twist at the end will be compared to
another great film from earlier this year.<br /><br />Until the last twenty minutes, I thought I was watching the best movie of
the year, however the person I saw it with said it is the greatest film
they
had ever seen.<br /><br />Anyway, if you liked Trainspotting, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, and even
Taxi Driver, then you will more than likely love this very unique
film.<br /><br />9.5 out of ten up to the last twenty minutes.
7 out of ten for the whole movie.
