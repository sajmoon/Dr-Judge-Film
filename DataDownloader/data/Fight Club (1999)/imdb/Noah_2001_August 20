Even after the 6th time.  (I just can&acute;t get bored watching this film)
Incredible experiential exploration of the insanity that lurks in the
back of everyones mind.  You just might not know it yet.<br /><br />A wonderfully extreme satirical reflection on the 'state of the nation'
of young, urban, white collar professionals  (but on a very human,
individual scale.)  Hilariously funny too.<br /><br />Could leave you bewildered, staring at the wall with tastes and
smells lingering in your mouth and your mind racing over the story.<br /><br />Reminiscent of the experience reading a great novel.  It has that
capacity to engage 100% with your imagination in a way that few
films can  (something up to now I have only experienced reading a
novel.)
