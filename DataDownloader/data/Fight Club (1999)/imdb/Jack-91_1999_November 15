1999_November 15 
<br /><br />This film was certainly a challenge for sight and indeed all senses. And
what a challenge to behold. David Fincher has created far and away the
best
movie of 1999. I did not like the philosophy of life mumble jumble of the
Matrix, it sounded only as empty words but this film really spoke to me on
a
philosophic level. You felt every word of every sentence, every gesture.
Pitt is outstanding, so is Edward Norton and Meat Loaf is a real surprise
as
the well endowed Robert Paulsen. I was totally blown away by the Fight
Club
and it has in no uncertain terms reminded me why I love going to the
movies!
