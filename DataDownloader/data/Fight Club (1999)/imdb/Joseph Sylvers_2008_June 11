The movie is not the twist, it&#39;s the movie. Surrounded by hype, and a
video game tie in(irony), it&#39;s still a great adaptation of an alright
book. Like it or not this movie had a big impact on a lot of people,
not mentioning those who actually started less philosophically
concerned fight clubs of their own(i can think of a few sadly). It&#39;s
not the greatest movie ever made, though it will be for a while for
some(blush). It&#39;s another in a line of effective points of zeitgeist
for modern counter-culture (The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc.) and all
that jazz, but it is effective. And the actors Pitt, Norton, Cater, and
even Meat Loaf, all turn out iconic performances. As a great movie
moment in transgressive literature it works, but not the best movie
ever. Good for what it is, if you can sift through the hype and the
violence.
