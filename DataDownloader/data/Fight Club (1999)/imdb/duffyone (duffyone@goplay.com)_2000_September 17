fight club was one of the most amazing films i've ever
seen.
brad pitt played a pretty cool sociopathic &quot;cult&quot; leader, and ed norton,
yet
again, played the role given to him with excellence.  helena bonham
carter,
(although she smoked a bit too much for my taste) filled in the role very
sexily and was a great female lead.  seeing meat loaf with breasts was a
surprise, but i thought that was cool that he can come in and do something
like that, he rocks.  &quot;i say&quot; go out and see this movie, find this movie,
buy this movie, if ya don't have any money, you should steal this
movie!
