As far as all the Brad Pitt movies this would have to be the best. Way
better than Se7en, and more action than Snatch or Troy. Fight Club is
one of the greatest movies of all time. From comedy to sci-fi thriller,
fight club has it all. And as you travel through the twisted minds of
Jack and Tyler. Remember one thing, the first rule of fight club is you
don&#39;t talk about fight club!<br /><br />And for my personal opinion on the movie, its great, a master piece
from the brilliant mind of David Fincher. This is definitely a DVD you
are going to want to own, i recommend the special edition. Its cram
pact full of bonus features.
