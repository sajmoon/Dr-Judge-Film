Fight Club is frantic and difficult to watch at the best of times. I
understand the message, we live in a consumer driven society and Jack
and Tyler set up the &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; in rejection to it. Interesting, but
the film&#x27;s execution is messy and in the end I was less enthralled but
more glad that it was over.<br /><br />The film uses excessive violence because it can. It adds little meaning
to what&#x27;s being presented here....and I&#x27;m still unsure of what Fincher
is trying to present in the first place. In any case the violence does
not progress the story, it is unbearable as it is presented as almost
having healing qualities.<br /><br />I was indifferent to the character of Jack, as he has no appealing
qualities. I was unsure of whether to find the idea of his refuge in
cancer and tuberculosis groups interesting or sickening. The audience
are expected to accept this, along with the other strange actions of
Jack and Tyler. To be fair, they were good performances, though I have
severe gripes with the characters.<br /><br />It is safe to say I did not &#x27;get&#x27; Fight Club. I do not &#x27;get&#x27; how one
would consider this a masterpiece of modern cinema. I admit that my
enjoyment did suffer to the fact that the twist was ruined for me
before I saw it. Still considering this I was underwhelmed. I can&#x27;t
really say skip it as it has a huge fan base and I wonder whether I do
not know what I am talking about. You may enjoy it. I did not.
