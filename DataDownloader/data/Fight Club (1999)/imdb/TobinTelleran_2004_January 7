This film gives a glimpse at what great character based film making can
be.
Edward Norton is perfect for the role of Jack and Brad Pitt as Tyler is
great along side.<br /><br />The movie follows the degradation of Jack's life as step by step we see
him
give up is job and start the revolutionary underground group: fight
club.<br /><br />The film offers un-biased insight into western Americanized culture.
Through
Jack and Tyler's eyes we see the world in which we live and the lives we
lead. The dirty underbelly of the city portrayed in fight club allows us
to
see how corrupt the corporations and high fliers that spurned this culture
truly are.<br /><br />Coupled with true to life dialogue and a magnificently well concealed
twist
leads to a fantastic film which you have to watch at least
twice.<br /><br />The film is splendidly shot with subtle but brilliant lighting effects.
Claudio Miranda and Jeff Cronenweth should be commended.<br /><br />Copyright January 2003.
