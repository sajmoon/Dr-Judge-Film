A superb movie, with some of the best acting, cinematography, music and
dialogue I have seen for a long time. Extremely stylish, yet retains a raw
and relentless edge. Also some very funny lines, and one of the most
insanely quotable films I have ever seen. This movie will make you think,
whether you like it or not, and there is a depth to it that I was
completely
unprepared for the first time I saw it. A few stunning moments, along with
truly profound observations and edge of your seat tension. Both Norton and
Pitt play the parts wonderfully, and Norton's double role as narrator works
well. Probably not suitable for those easily offended by violence, but
otherwise there really is a message in this movie, a strong one that will
not go away. See this movie, it is the one you have been waiting for if you
are in the least bit cynical about the way society sometimes seems to be
going, or if you just really fancy a great way to spend a few
hours.
