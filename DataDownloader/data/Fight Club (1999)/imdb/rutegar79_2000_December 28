Excellent movie!  Fairly faithful to the book.  I was very skeptical going
in but came out pleasantly surprised.  Ed Norton is the man!  The movie
isn't for everyone though.  I worked in Blockbuster, and I found out that
some are impossible to please.  Women complained that there was too much
fighting.  The men complained that there wasn't enough.  I think they all
missed the point.  I am surrounded by idiots.
