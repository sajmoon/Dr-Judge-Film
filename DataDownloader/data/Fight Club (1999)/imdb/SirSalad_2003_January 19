I've must have seen this movie a dozen times, and each time, I was just a
little swept off my feet. Movies just don't compare to Fight Club.
Brilliant
acting, perfect character cast, genius plot, need I say more? I think I
should. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie doesn't know what an awesome
movie
is.
