Never seen such an epic movie with the perfect ending. It entertained
me from the word go. It doesn&#x27;t bore you at all or maybe at least from
the time Brad Pitt&#x27;s entrance. The acting of both the actors including
Marla. Both the direction and acting leads ton epic movie. You cannot
miss watching this movie. I will not compare it to Shawshank But would
still say they are equally matched. It is a must watch!!!<br /><br />If you are a fan of Hollywood then you cannot miss fight club...Edward
Norton is the main reason you have to see for. But obviously the acting
of Brad Pitt is not even a little far behind. They dominate scene after
scene and that is the main thing which keeps you entertained..
