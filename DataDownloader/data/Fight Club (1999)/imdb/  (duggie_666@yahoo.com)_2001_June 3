fight club is one of the few films that the more i watch it the better it
gets  pitt nad norton were both amazing but pitt got the best lines<br /><br />that is the best thing about the movie the script is so good that you will
hang on every word that is said lines such as ''our great war is our
spiritual war our great depression is our lives''  lines with such meaning
make you say them again and again in your head and think about what they
mean to you   even lines that are much more simpler but still have meaning
in them ''how much can you know about yourself if youv'e never being in a
fight''  that should be thought about alot,  by men anyway there is
nothing
about this film that i dont like
the first time i saw it though i thought the end wasn't great but the more
you watch it the more it makes sense.    what i got from the end was that
everyday people struggle to be someone else or need change in their life
and
that is a theme in this film.
and if your a guy then you will love the fighting: bloody, violent and
very
cool.  fight club se7en and snatch are the movies that proove that brad
pitt
can be really cool and not a ponce like his other movies...
