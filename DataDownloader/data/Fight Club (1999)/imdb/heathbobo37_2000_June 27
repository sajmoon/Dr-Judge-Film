This movie is easily one of my favorites of all time. It was both
entertaining and enlightening, something many movies try to  achieve but
fail to accomplish. The story is engrossing and you cant stop watching. As
soon as the credits roll, youll want to see it again, and mostly likely
again. This movie is not for all, its more oriented to the 30 and under
crowd. It is a great divergence from the Reality Bites type of Gen X
movies.
The plot twist is completely out of left field, but makes sense and the
ending is one of the best in cinematic history. The DVD is the best ever,
and is worth the money to buy a DVD player just to see
it.
