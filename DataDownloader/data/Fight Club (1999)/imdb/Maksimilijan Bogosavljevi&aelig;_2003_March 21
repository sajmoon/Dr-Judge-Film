2003_March 21 
This is a good example of what happens when people who&#39;ve been reading
comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their
own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher&#39;s adolescent
pursuits but the point I&#39;m trying to get at is that there is very
little articulate and nothing even remotely original about &quot;Fight
Club&quot;. Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big
incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early &#39;90s MTV, Kubrick, punk,
etc, etc&#133;.<br /><br />When all the unnatural &#39;coolness&#39; (jump cuts, hipper than thou
narrative, flickering images&#133;) is stripped away, what you&#39;re left with
is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order,
human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world,
male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its
characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it&#39;s
especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of
view is present. As it is, &quot;Fight Club&quot; doesn&#39;t even seem to have a
coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than
maybe &quot;go let it out&quot; or &quot;if it feels good do it&quot;. Yeah man,
rock&#39;n&#39;roll!!!<br /><br />It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in
credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old
professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the
world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with.
He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging
by his misery you&#39;d think somebody else chose it for him). Battle
that&#39;s fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices,
airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class,
business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching
from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort,
meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to
have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that
he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or
disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases
dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of
freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. &quot;I let go. I found
freedom. Losing all hope was freedom&quot;, he reasons. Until&#133;..Marla Singer
(Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up.
She, you see, is also a &#39;tourist&#39; - someone pretending to be sick - and
the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings
bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He
confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they
divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but
only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each
other on &#39;Friends&#39;.<br /><br />The story then shifts to Narrator&#39;s relationship with a strange but
fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it
off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after
Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a
result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to
turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in
a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler&#39;s insistence they found a
weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique
where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by
beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has
been looking for all his adult life.<br /><br />Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a
return, Tyler&#39;s behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to
pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy
points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience
store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a
threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism
overload!!! And how deep, too!<br /><br />The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy
ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory
display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action
movie can do without.<br /><br />In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music
video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher
also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than
Jonze&#39;s dismal &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; it&#39;s still a pretty mediocre
offering. Those who refer to &quot;Fight Club&quot; as a masterpiece probably
also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation&#39;s
sharpest voices.
