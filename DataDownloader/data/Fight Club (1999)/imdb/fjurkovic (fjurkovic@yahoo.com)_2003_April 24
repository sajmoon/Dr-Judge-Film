Fight Club is sure one of the best movie ever. But it is also one of the
most dangerous movie. At least if you take the movie so serious as me. I
think I understand this movie like no other. After I first saw this movie
I
did quit my well-paid job where I was working for five years. I quit my
home, my friends, my family and I moved to another country without luggage
and without money. For three months I lived in fight-club-a-like
underground
community. It was amazing experience but it has some dark moments too. Now
after I'm back to &quot;usual everyday life&quot; I still surprised with this David
Fincher masterpiece and how he has the power to shake with my life like no
other director. The message in this movie had a deep impact to me. I give
100 points out of 10!!! for Fight Club - because for me there is no other
movie that changed my life so much.
