And that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as complimenting this film as
something that makes you think. It&#x27;s entertainment. But pretty Stylish
and Cunning entertainment. In the modern world, where we have become
bored of violence as entertainment, we are more interested in causes
and consequences of violence. That&#x27;s what this movie is. It&#x27;s overrated
but it&#x27;s still pretty damn good. It&#x27;s bullocks under a wonderful
disguise called Style.<br /><br />So, in short: entertainment based on clever scripts and crazy stuff
always appeals on people who respects them. Speaking for myself, go and
enjoy this movie.
