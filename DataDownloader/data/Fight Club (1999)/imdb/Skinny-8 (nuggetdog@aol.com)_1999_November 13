Here in Harrisburg, Pa I have an on going battle with the local movie
reviewer at &quot;The Patriot-News&quot;. She insists on giving every science fiction
movie the same rating: &quot;not the worst&quot;. Which in numerical value would be a
2 out of 5. So when I opened up my paper on the opening day of the movie, I
expected to see the same review. Sure enough it read: &quot;Fight Club: Not the
worst&quot;. I thought that this movie deserved a least a 4 out of five. It had
an orgional plot and as always Brad Pitt did a great job. This movie
reviewer has also give &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; a 2 out of 5 and &quot;The Matrix&quot; a
3 out of five. Each of these movies deserved at least a point
higher.
