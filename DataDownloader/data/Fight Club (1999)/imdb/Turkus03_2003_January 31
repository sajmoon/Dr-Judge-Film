Fight Club, unfortunately, is a movie that requires reasonable intellect
to
understand.  To say that this movie is about violence is insanely
unfounded
and unresearched.  To get into the nitty gritty of Fight Club, you really
have to study the words and the messages in the movie carefully.
Obviously,
not much can be said considering the ending of the film, but many things
can
be reasonably discussed.<br /><br />This movie, while on the surface is about a shallow excuse to fight, is
about the destruction (in the author's view) of men.  Bob is actually a
central character in the movie as he sums up EVERYTHING that men have
become
in today's society...women.  Men need to cook, clean, and do things that
were widely considered female tasks centuries before.  But men, by their
nature, are hunters and gatherers...warriors.  This movie tries to say
that
men are being turned away from being warriors.  Men are no longer men,
they
are no longer individuals but part of a larger, more feminine, mold.  Bob
is
the epitome of this (thus the reason for Bob's resolution in the film, it
matches the director's feelings towards this subjectification of men)
ideal
man...a body builder who has the societal joys of life only to have the
world turn him upside down...as he has basically become a
woman.<br /><br />Fight Club nails home several messages that most movies and novels never
get
out the door with.  Anti-society, anti-big business, and
pro-communism...all
of which go to the author's view of men as an enslaved perpetual being
rather than a multitude of individuals.<br /><br />The violence is the return of man to his most raw of forms, and Tyler
Durden
is the epitome of what every man wishes they could be.  Fincher also makes
an unbelievable amount of hints towards the film's 180 conclusion and
causes
second, third, fourth, and often times TENTH re-views.  Excellent movie
that
is for &quot;the enlightened&quot; and not to be taken as a straightforward vehicle
for Brad Pitt and some violence.
