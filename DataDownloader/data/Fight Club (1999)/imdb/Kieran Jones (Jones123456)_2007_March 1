Fight club where to begin..... i expected watching this would be a
bore,rubbish fighting and poor plot i was very....... wrong this has
unique outlooks ,a stirring plot and a bone crushing powerful fight
sequences,Fight club as a dark comedy action film simply delivers, in
every way. Brilliantly pieced together and awesome performances from
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make this a watchable and class act.
Although for some people unbelieve ablily and generally being bored may
creep in but to me the story twists and turns and unravels itself in
unexpected ways. watching this movie makes you remember what being a
person is all about..............
