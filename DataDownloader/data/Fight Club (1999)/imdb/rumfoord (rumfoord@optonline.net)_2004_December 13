Fight Club is a fantastic movie in almost every sense. Aesthetically
speaking, it is probably the most imaginative Fincher film. What's
really impressive though, is the way that Fincher managed to broaden
the appeal of the story, without compromising Palahniuk's message. The
book is certainly entertaining as hell, but the reader is always
councious of the way the book attempts to indoctrinate you (in the same
vein as Atlas Shrugged). This is due in large part to Palahniuk's
narrator being closer in character to Tyler Durden than Fincher's
narrator is. By balancing the characters in the film, Fincher keeps the
dynamic interesting, and avoids descending into a preachy tone. This
accomplishes the almost unheard of on screen feat of actually improving
upon a book.<br /><br />Indeed, judging by Palahniuk's work after fight club, it seems he too
prefers Fincher's permutation. Bravo!
