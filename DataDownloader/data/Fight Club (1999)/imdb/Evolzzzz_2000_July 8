I've read too many too positive reviews on Fight Club.
The 'great plot twist' was not a big surprise for me and the ending left me
unsatisfied.<br /><br />Fight Club is NOT shocking..... ok?<br /><br />Many people will like Fight Club. 
I enjoyed it , but absolutely nothing more than that. There are some cool
jokes and Meatloaf is great as a big breasted testicular cancer guy on
hormones. Brad Pitt and the rest are good too.  Also the message is ok : we
are consumers...<br /><br />Fight Club is original , unusual and pretty weird. BUT WHERE IS THE CLIMAX
??<br /><br />6.5  out of 10
