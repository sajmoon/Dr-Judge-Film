Going in to see this, I expected the typical darkness that David Fincher
brings to his movies.  Coming out of this, I had respect for Brad Pitt, as
an actor, I thought Edward Norton was one of the most cunningly funny guys
out there, and Fight Club was/is the best movie of '99.  Although the movie
may be very brutal ( in fact the overall gore is low, it's just how honest
the film makers made it), foremost it is a dark comedy.  The film had me
laughing at times that normally I wouldn't think is proper, but that is the
point of this film.  The narrator wants you to see how everything means
nothing, and nothing is to be taken seriously.  One point in this movie
either loses you, or totally draws you in.  Personally, when the plot got
crazier, I drooled for even more.  <br /><br />This movie is made to offend, engross, and enlighten.  If it does at least
two of those, then it accomplishes what it set out to do.  It's a trip you
soon won't forget.  <br /><br />warning: seeing this movie repeated times could leave you to believe that
Project Mayhem is a good idea.
