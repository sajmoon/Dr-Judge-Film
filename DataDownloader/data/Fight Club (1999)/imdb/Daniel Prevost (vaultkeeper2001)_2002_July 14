Fight Club is one of my all time favorites somewhere on my top 10 list.It
was an absolutly astonishing and excellent movie.If American Beauty wasnt
out that yeare it would have been the best movie of the year but hey
second
place isnt that bad.I'd have to recommend this to any true movie fan.It
had
all the qualities of a good movie take for instance the extroidinary
preformances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.Almost every scene in the
movie was either hilarious or violent which is a combination for a
movie.Perhaps one of the greatest films of the twenhtieth century.So rare
and unique in film making it is even better then the novel.MY rating
10/10.
