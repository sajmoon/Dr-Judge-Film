...I can say that without even having seen The Godfather. This is the
perfect movie for one simple reason: It&#x27;s Not The Perfect Movie!
Confused? I&#x27;d be to. This motion picture does not have the best
Characters, the best Story, the best Screenplay not even the best
Director. No, but it&#x27;s got the best Message. Very simple. &#x22;Perfection
is not and will never be the goal!&#x22; Fight Club showed us that we are so
obsessed with our ourselves just so we can build ourself a big fat
solid ego. So open your eyes! And be enlightened be this brilliant Mind
blowing, Prejudice changing, Ass kicking rush. This ain&#x27;t a Movie, this
is a Mirror.
