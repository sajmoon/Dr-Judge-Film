Fight Club is one of the most amazing Films of Modern Cinema, It has an
original narrative, great acting and superb direction. Fight club is not
for
everyone and I would recommend viewers should be at least 16 to appreciate
the level of depth this film has to offer as well as the violence being a
bit to gracious for younger viewers.
Many critics and audience members have complained about the level of
violence in
The film and how it can have an effect on viewers. However I believe that
the this
film has something to say and that is not carry out the messages in the
film, it isn't
saying start a Fight Club yourself and beat your friends to a pulp, it's
simply a
metaphor for young people to do something with their lives, don't just sit
around
becoming a couch potato and let yourself become another Jack.<br /><br />This film works on so many levels, First off as a Black comedy, then as a
Thriller mixed with action and strong conventions of a drama genre. The
acting in this one is just incredible, Edward Norton has been robbed twice
before at the Oscars and once again being Robbed by not even being
Nominated. Brad Pitt has also again proved that he is a very talented actor
(One of the most underrated actors around).<br /><br />In my opinion David Fincher is one of the best directors of all time and
quite possibly the best around at the moment. I love the dark, harsh
lighting he brings to his films, He uses a wide range of different
techniques in the film, to help and confuse the audience. I love the CGI
shots he uses through out the film.  This is one of those Films where the
CG
shots actually add to the film rather than just there to make it look
visually good.<br /><br />Fight Club is very well scripted and although different form the book is
just as good, Which is quite a compliment considering books are usually
much
better. There are some very good One liners as well as excellent scenes of
dialogue.<br /><br />The Twist at the end of the film is very interesting and many people have
complained that it takes something-away form the rest of the film however I
feel that it adds to the twisted narrative. In my opinion this is the best
film that I have ever seen for so many different reasons. This film
actually
has you thinking for a time after seeing it, which hardly any Hollywood
productions do these days.<br /><br />This film definitely deserves a 10 out of 10, which I have only given to
one
other film before. Go out and see this one if you haven't already.<br /><br />
