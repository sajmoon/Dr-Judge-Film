2000_July 5 

When I rented this one, I expected a so-so movie that I would probably rate
a 5, but I was wrong. This is a well made film filled with really good
performances and some rather unusual casting that works, including Pitt and
Carter. It also has a great sense of humor and even though it is overlong it
moves at a pretty fast pace. The only thing I found a bit disappointing was
the ending. My rating: 7 out of 10.
