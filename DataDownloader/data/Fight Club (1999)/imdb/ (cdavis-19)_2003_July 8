I saw this film when it first came out and just loved it.  Watched it
twice
in a row - the second time picking up on the clues left.  However, I saw
the
film a month or so after 9/11 and was jarred by what a different
experience
it was. And I think the key factor is that it is a movie that appealed
very
much to self-professed anarchists, of which I confess I've always
considered
myself.  The idealized version.  9/11 was the actuality.  Admittedly, the
motives were completely different and I still think the primary messages
in
Fight Club - the numbing half-sleep we navigate life in, what does it take
to feel alive, what is it to be a man in today's world, the
anti-consumerism
riffs - these are all relevant and unscathed.  It just made me rethink
monkeywrenching a bit.
