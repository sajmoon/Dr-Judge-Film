Well what can i say about the movie i consider the best i have ever
seen?
First of all this is one of those movies that are probably going to have
an
impact on you and maybe even change the way that you think about some
stuff.
It tackles many social problems known to everybody but not really
discussed
and offers a new view on the capabilities of the average
man.
The directing is done in a exquisite way with fast shots and some shots
where Fincher's expierience from shooting video clips is
obvious.
The storyline is near to perfect very focused and tight a great story told
in a great way.
One other thing i'd like to not is the excellent soundtrack.<br /><br />I've only bought two movie soundtracks this and for The Matrix. The Dust
Brothers do a really great job making the movie more alive with some great
strong music.
Of course the acting from Norton and Pitt is excellent and i could say one
thousand more things about what is great about this that you won't be able
to understand before you watch this movie three times. So go and get
it!
