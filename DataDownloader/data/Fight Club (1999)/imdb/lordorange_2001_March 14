The Movie Fight Club was Awesome. Many of you see it as a movie all about
fighting and beating but there is a deeper meaning to it. Most of the
movie
was bloody beatings but amist of all of that the underlying meaning of the
movie is: Open Your Eyes and look at the real world. What many people fail
to see is the meaning of Tyler's proclimations. Most of us think it's
funny
little jokes but they are all true. (This movie was also more informative
than the Discovery Channel) Tyler reminds us that we are all going to die
someday and our possesions are useless. So I Think this movie is extremely
well done and the director carved a message so meaningful out of a movie
with senseless beating<br /><br />Rating
