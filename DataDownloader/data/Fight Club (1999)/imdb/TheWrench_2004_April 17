I actually read the book Fight Club before I saw the movie. I actually
read
it at a book store when it had recently been released. So by the time the
movie had come out I forgot I read it. This movie is so great that it is
even better than the book. It works for so many kinds of people also:
smart
people, dumb people, and dumb people who want other people to think
they're
smart. Fight Club is most definitely a guy movie. It deals with
acceptance,
and male bonding, and testosterone, and loneliness. It follows an unnamed
character (Edward Norton) through some big changes in his life. In the
movie
they never say his name, and in the book he didn't have a name. So for
those
of you who call him &quot;Jack&quot; you are wrong. He becomes friends with an
outrageous Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). I don't want to say too much about it
for people who may have not seen it. But it's smart, and entertaining, and
definitely leaves plenty of room for conversations once the movie is over.
It's a must see for any movie lover, even the ones who are idiots and
don't
like narrative voice overs. This is one of the few movies I actually saw
in
the theater 4 times.
