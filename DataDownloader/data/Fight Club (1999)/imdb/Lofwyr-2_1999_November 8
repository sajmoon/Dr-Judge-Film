1999_November 8 

I originally wanted to see Fight Club due to the fact that I'm an obsessive
Pixies/Frank Black fan, I knew &quot;Where Is My Mind&quot; was in the film. I was
not, however, prepared for the treat I got.<br /><br />Fight Club was probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, but in
a
good sense. By the time I left the theater, I couldn't think straight do to
the ideas literally shoved upon you. I don't really want to give much away,
but I spent days talking and arguing about the various concepts dished out
in the film.<br /><br />Edward Norton's unnamed character (who I'll refer to as Jack for obvious
reasons) is complex and thought out. His constant voice-overs and
narrations
are actually quite captivating. Brad Pitt was not bad (and pretty funny) as
Tyler, and Helan Bonham Carter did a decent job as the chain-smoking
Marla.<br /><br />The real star, though, is the plot. Everyone raved about how great the plot
twist of the Sixth Sense was, but I honestly think Fight Club's little
secret was even more stunning. I had to watch the movie again to pick out
some of the tiny details that I missed.<br /><br />Many of the people said they did not like Fight Club, do to violence, or
the
fact that they did not understand or like what they were saying. This film
IS NOT for the common movie-goer. You definitely need an open mind to enjoy
this movie, as well as a stomach for some of the gritty contents. But if
you
are ready for a wild ride with enough material to keep you talking for the
next few months, get the hell out of your seat and see Fight
Club.
