this film has to be the most confusing movie i&#39;ve seen right up until i
figured it ALL out. At first i HATED this film with a passion, but
David Fincher has always been one of my favorites with Se7en, and the
game and panic room, he know how to direct very well. If u don&#39;t like
complicating movies that are just plain weird, don&#39;t see this. Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton totally are 2 of the BEST actors on the planet.
I&#39;m not going to tell you what this movie is about because i want you
to see for yourself, but just remember, be WIDE AWAKE because it is
long, confusing and weird. it has a NON original ending, but probably
one of the best of it&#39;s series. it&#39;s OK. 8/10
