I can&#x27;t begin to explain how misguided some people are regarding the
overall theme of this movie. They have completely missed the entire
message of the movie. It is not a &#x27;fighting&#x27; movie solely, and it is
not meant to encourage fighting or represent &#x27;real&#x27; fighting, in the
real world. It is a film, it is not 100% accurate or representative of
real life, and if you have the mindset of &#x27;this is a fighting movie, a
bloke movie&#x27;, or any other shallow view, you will certainly be sorely
disappointed.<br /><br />It exists as more of a reflection of society today &#x96; our preoccupation
with materialistic goods, with celebrities who have done nothing to
deserve our attention or respect, and the fact that we follow society&#x27;s
whims and do the same thing everyday, go to work, sleep, go to work
again. And for what purpose? The movie challenges all these things but
in a way that isn&#x27;t in your face and blatant. You need to think about
the movie, dwell on it, and perhaps take away something from the
viewing, a philosophy or way of looking at life that you didn&#x27;t have
before.<br /><br />But in the end, one of the sad things is that most of the people who
watch the movie (including me, despite my best efforts to the contrary)
are the very &#x27;society&#x27; it questions. Those who watch the movie, discard
it as not being an accurate or realistic depiction of &#x27;fight clubs&#x27;,
and go back to their jobs with not a thought as to why. That, I think,
is what I find so compelling about the film &#x96; that it presents you with
these views and ways of looking at the world, and then the viewers turn
around and ignore it, returning to their everyday life.<br /><br />You need to look at this movie as more of an essay on life and society
and its values in this current age. When looked at as simply another
&#x27;movie&#x27;, or only about &#x27;fighting&#x27;, much can be overlooked. I urge you
to watch it again, with an open mind; consider what it is saying and
look within yourself to see whether you fall into the demographic it is
talking about.<br /><br />But then, it may be said; aren&#x27;t we all a part of society? Don&#x27;t we all
follow its rules and regulations, even as we seek to go against it? The
answers may seem clear, but are open to question. Not every person on
earth is. But most of the people who will end up watching the film are,
those who work jobs and have not a clue why they do so. To earn money?
Support a family? The reasons differ. The truth is, we do not need
these luxuries and rituals that we have so easily become accustomed to
in this digital age.<br /><br />This movie isn&#x27;t a manual on how to live our lives. Rather, it raises
questions about how we live and demands answers.<br /><br />And the sad thing is, most of what it brings up about society is
absolutely right.
