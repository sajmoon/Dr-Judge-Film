Fight Club is a brilliant and brutal look at consumerism in a modern
day and age. The film features magnificent acting, a wonderful plot (with
a
great twist at the end,) and many other strengths, but the area in which
it
really impressed me was its unique, original style. It is very hard to
describe the visual techniques used in the film, but if you've seen it,
you
know what I'm talking about. There are some truly wonderful CG scenes (you
can see how they were made in the TERRIFIC DVD.) I just wish all films
could
feel as unique and artistic as this one does. Although violence does play
a
strong part in the movie, it is a very necessary aspect, and shouldn't be
too discouraging (unless, of course, you're particularly squeamish.) All
in
all, Fight Club does a lot of things right. It addresses an intelligent
moral and social issue using a very unique style, and it does all this
with
nearly flawless acting and wonderful directing.<br /><br />By the way, one of the few other movies I have enjoyed recently that
has a really good, original style is Run Lola Run. If you get a chance,
check it out - it's also a really good film.
