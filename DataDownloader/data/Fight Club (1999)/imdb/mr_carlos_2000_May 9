After watching Fight Club, I can't think that someone disliked this movie.
It's almost perfect. Let's begin with the acting. Edward Norton should be
nominated for playing his character, because he's great as always, while
Brad Pitt is just OK. The story is fabulous. Almost every sentence said is
a
memorable quote. And the directing! David Fincher is better than ever, with
the coolest, never seen before, camera moves.
As it is becoming a Fincher standards, this movie, has a surprise ending,
even though it didn't needed one to be good, like The Sixth Sense. But that
ending leads to a problem. It's an ending, that you don't believe, cause
it's so weird, and strange. But it adds some fun to the movie, so it's ok.
The soundtrack is good, basically techno by Dust Brothers, but the most
fascinating thing about this movie, is that there are no good guys, neither
bad guys. The person who watches defines if they're good or
bad.
