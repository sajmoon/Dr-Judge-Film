When i first heard of fight club in &quot;96, i thought it just might be the
usual mindless violence formula the modern movie industry uses all to
often. But after reading the book and seeing the movie I finally saw
the moral that David Finch and Chuck Pahlaniun were trying to
communicate about my generation and its pointless shopping habits,
working jobs we hate for stuff we really don't need. A entire
generation of men working to define themselves through clothes and cars
and fancy colognes. I hate to be easily influenced but this movie made
me look at my own lifestyle and how i was nothing more than a white
collar slave. The only problem i see in this movie is that only a
select few actually got the message this movie was trying to
portray.Mosat people thinking that this was just another movie about
nothing more than another movie of male aggression. If you think I'm
being stupid read Chuck Palhnuin's new introduction in fight club.
