I love when movies shows how violent are the f@cking Americans.<br /><br />Some can be surprise and don&#x27;t admit that all that you can see in the
movie happens everyday in Yankee-land.<br /><br />Some say its a crappy trash, well you should open your eyes a bit. <br /><br />Comments like this one &#x22;A day after the experience, I am still trying
to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent
subtlety of &#x22;Seven&#x22; could create such garbage. Yes, the violence was
gratuitous and excessive, but oddly enough that was the least of this
films worries.<br /><br />Where to begin? The plot was ridiculous on it&#x27;s face, absolutely
incoherent and nonsensical. The various themes of the movie were
amplified and remarkably shallow, showing no real insight into the
problems of our society. Ours is an overly commercial culture? This is
neither original nor especially interesting, especially when repeated
ad nauseate.<br /><br />Fincher&#x27;s direction and sophomoric MTV-style presentation did nothing
to help a script that never got any further than &#x22;live free or die&#x22;
(with minor variations). Most of the dialog reminded me of something my
high school English teacher used to say when her students ventured out
of their league: &#x22;That&#x27;s so deep it&#x27;s shallow&#x22;. This succinctly
describes the handling of every major theme in the film.<br /><br />Then there are the performances. Edward Norton, an otherwise gifted
actor, does little with the simplistic character he&#x27;s given. There is
no complexity to this character whatsoever and Norton can do nothing to
help define him. His early attempts at playing the neurotic are
particularly unconvincing. Brad Pitt has more to work with in the Tyler
Durden character, but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything
about his character (even beyond what the script calls for, or should
have called for) makes Norton&#x27;s performance seem that much more vapid.
Helena Bonham Carter simply showed up; throughout the movie, one had
the feeling that she desperately wanted to be somewhere else. It seems
hard to blame her.<br /><br />Had this been the work of any number of other directors I could name,
it would be easy to dismiss the overheated message of this film.
Fincher is capable of such subtlety and craftsmanship that it is hard
to believe he could put his name to such a juvenile, simplistic film.
One hopes that &#x22;Seven&#x22; is not the only thing of beauty we see from Mr.
Fincher.&#x22;, makes me want to vomit.
