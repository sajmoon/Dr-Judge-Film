2000_November 30 

After the previews I saw I was not excited about seeing the film. The
scenes
of fight, the scent of violence, the blood splitting everywhere is not my
idea of a great movie. BUT, first: this is not just a movie. Second:
previews -in an average percentage- are 98 to 100 a joint of images that
has
nothing to do with the movie itself. And third: THE MOVIE WAS NOT ABOUT
THE
KIND OF FIGHT -meaningless and ridiculous- that guys for any reason could
-and do- have.
This film TURNED ON MY BRAIN in a way that only those who wanna take a
chance and see it will certainly experience. I can tell, this movie is as
powerful enough to change lives.
Edward Norton, as always, is by all means gifted. He can make you feel
anything and everything just with a gesture. From my humble position of an
amateur actress I envy his skills and I'm willing to go to hell for this
sin. It is amazing the way he works and the feelings he manages with, like
a
magician... taking them out of his top-hat soul and making them appear in
ours. That's magic. That's talent. That's him. God did not touched him,
God
grabbed him!
Brad Pitt is an amazing actor too, and together they are unbeatleable...!
Dinamite for emotions. Soap plus other stuff, you know...<br /><br />This cast, Palahniuk's idea and Fincher's direction made this movie a
story
that could not be possibly better.
I hardly recommend this movie to EVERYBODY, specially to those who are in
their 20's. You, male or female, will feel with an amazing intensity how
close you are to Norton's character.
Won't, can't and don't want to say anything else. This is not a movie to
spoil with 'previous words'.
But see it, feel it, get amazed and then talk by yourself. The 'after
words'
will be inevitable. And your thoughts will never be the
same.
And you'll be thankful for that.
