It is rare that a film of this caliber is released and consumed by a mass
audience. It got given quite a big premiere and was reasonably hyped up.
Believe the hype, believe what people say, even if it is bad because
basically you have to see this film and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Its tone and pace can be classified as a flaw because it is never in a
state
of equilibrium, which may frighten the average consumer but in my opinion
it
heightens the sinister multi layered undertone and satirical narrative
from
the outset.<br /><br />The fight scenes are brutal and unsaturised, although this is not where
the
heart of the film lies. It lies with the relationship between the two main
characters and their basic bordom of general life. It is the obsession of
the modern man to crave violence or some sort of escapist equivalent, in
this case the lack of respect for authority and resortion to violence is
the
escape.<br /><br />Never have I seen such brilliant cinematic construction of each scene. The
care Finchner takes to construct every scene is unbelievable, and is a
wicked follow up to Se7en and The Game.<br /><br />Basically, watch it, do not take it for its aesthetic value and dark
visuals. Just revel in as the complex plot unfolds and climaxes in a
scintallating final scene, which epitimises the message Finchner builds
up.
