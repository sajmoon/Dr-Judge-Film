Fight Club is the best movie i have seen so far, and it is the movie I
can watch over and over again and it gets better each time. have just
ordered the book. I am not big reader but if the book is as good as the
movie i willl read it without a problem! Best rated movie, to every1
who haven&#39;t seen it, watch it as fast as possible! Any1 got a tip about
movies that is something on the level as fight club or a little close?
hard finding good movies these days :/<br /><br />10/10 you will always catch new things in the movie, and you will
always like it no matter how many times you have seen it!<br /><br />If anyone got tip for other good movies plz post to me or send it to
spawn19_91@hotmail.com <br /><br />thanks, i hope edward norton will have a good comeback soon!
