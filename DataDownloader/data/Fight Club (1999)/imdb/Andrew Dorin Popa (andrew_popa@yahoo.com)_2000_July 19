I love this movie ! I have seen it only once , but I will see it again.
Fight Club should won an Oscar for the best Screenplay or the best Director
- David Fincher. When you read the title FIGHT CLUB , you think is another
silly Karate Movie, but of course is NOT. Is a smart movie directed by a
master of this kinda movies -DAVID FINCHER ( who also direct Seven , The
Game and Alien 3 ).This movie stars a few GOOD actors like : Brad Pitt ,
Edward Norton , Meat Loaf . Ok , is a litlle bit violent , but is verry
original , you will never guess the ending . The movie is based on a book ,
and everybody must see it !
