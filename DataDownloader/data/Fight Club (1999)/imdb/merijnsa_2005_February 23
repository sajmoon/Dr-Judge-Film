I bought the Soundtrack and The special edition DVD of fight club...
doesn't say that enough? Not only the Dust Brothers makes the movie a
piece of art also Brad Pitt and Edward Norton makes this movie
unbelievable cool. <br /><br />The Story, Tyler Durden, Action and the very good acting from both
Stars makes this movie along with The Matrix the best movie of 1999. I
Think that this movies are the best of all but that is just my opinion. <br /><br />David Fincher, the director of Fight Club did a very good job on the
special effects because you don't really know when it is a special
effect. Only when the camera moves in a position when it is really
unable to do (just trough the streets or in a recycle bin you know it
is a special effect. <br /><br />Fight Club rullez!
