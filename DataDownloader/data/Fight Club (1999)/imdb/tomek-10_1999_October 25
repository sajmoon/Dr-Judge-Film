1999_October 25 

This is one of the best all year. It goes beyond just a normal movie and
takes you into the minds of the characters. Usually once you finish
watching
a movie you forget about it the next day, this is one that keeps you
thinking for many days after you see it.<br /><br />And to all those people who think this movie is pro-violence I think they
need to pay attention to the movie a little more.
