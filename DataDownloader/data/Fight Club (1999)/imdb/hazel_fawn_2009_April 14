People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies.
There&#x27;s only 4 or 5 movies with 10 stars or excellent rating on my list
(and believe me, I&#x27;ve seen them quite a lot). And for me, Fight club is
best film ever made. And I don&#x27;t think any other will surpass it. For
me, this is definitely not an action movie, nor a thriller. This is
psychological comedy. Yes, it is violent. Yes, there&#x27;s lot of fights
and blood, too much for my taste, but I take them, so as final twist,
as (and only as) a metaphor. Excellent casting, superb acting,
brilliant direction. Very thought provoking. I feel the urge to watch
it every year or two. But it&#x27;s just me:-)
