This movie is so amazing, I can't even begin to tell you.  If you haven't
seen it, you haven't been enlightened.  Don't listen to the critics, they
don't know what they were talking about.  They didn't see this movie for
what it is:<br /><br />A masterpiece.<br /><br />And the author!  Chuck Palahnuik made his debut with this novel.  Yes,
Fight
Club was based off an amazing book, and held very true to it.  That has
become a rarity in book-to-movie films today.  I have since read all of his
books, and each great.  I hope another is made into a movie, and I've heard
they are both optioned.  Read them.<br /><br />And The Pixies!  If you have no idea who The Pixies are, and you have any
care for rock music, you have been missing out on one of the most brilliant
bands ever.  The Pixies created alternative rock, not Nirvana, as many
misinformed fans have been led to believe.  Since seeing Fight Club, I have
obtained all of their albums and tributes and await more compilations.  If
you are a Pixies fan, guess which song is featured in the
movie.<br /><br />I can't believe this movie was overlooked at the Academys.  It should've at
least been nominated for:  best film, best director, best adapted
screenplay, best original score, best actor, best supporting actor, best
actress, best cinematography.  After you see it, you'll agree.  You're life
is ending one minute at a time.<br /><br />See Fight Club now.<br /><br />
