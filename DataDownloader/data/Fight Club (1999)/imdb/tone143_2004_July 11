The fantasy of a neo-marxist movement run by an unassuming white-collar
schmo and his sh_t-kickin' doppelganger,recruiting sociopathic dudes
for an anarchic terrorist movement is an adolescent wannabe &quot;gangsta's&quot;
wet dream.The incredible popularity of this movie is a sign of how
hollow things have gotten in this society.This movie is definitely a
technical achievement though,it's neo-cool colors and lighting and
bravado camera-work by David Fincher(&quot;Seven&quot;)are unrivaled,but the real
philosophical substance is blind nihilism bound with a good deal of
blue-collar angst.There are a few great movies out there that end with
nothing but the void to face-this one strangely glorifies it.Watch &quot;A
Clockwork Orange&quot;(a lot more layers to it)
