Fight Club is one of the best movies of all time.
It is an original,i have not seen a movie quite like it before,  Brad Pitt
and Edward Norton are doing one of the best roles in their careers (the
best), and the feeling you get after watching this movie is incredible, all
you know about you, your friends and how the world works have all been
false,  we are not special,we are slowly decaying, the global economic
inbalance is  hughe and we are doing nothing about it.<br /><br />Fight Club gives you not just a new perspective on life, but also the
greatest 2 hours of pure freak show! The music,the story and the dialogues
between the narrator and his friend are great. every time you watch the
movie you notice some small differences you didnt know, which makes it even
more satisfying.
I love this movie, people says it makes them sad, i think it makes me
enlightened, like Tyler said: &quot; F*** that, I say  let's
evolve&quot;&acute;.
