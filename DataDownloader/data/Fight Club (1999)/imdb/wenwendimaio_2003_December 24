Who says movies are just for entertainment? Well, whoever said it has
been
proven wrong by this movie. I'm prepared to say this is the best and most
meaningful movie ever made. Only if the academy judges had human minds
and
not give titanic 11 oscars and this none!!! This was mind blowing, i
admire
David Fincher for going out there and putting forward what he believed
in.
Every other psychological thriller deserves to be put into the garbage
compared to this, this has meanings to it and no other movies do to the
same
extent! After years of mediocrity and cliches, millions of sequels and
brainless crap, there has finally been something worth taking your hat
off
to. I give this 15/10, best movie ever!!!
