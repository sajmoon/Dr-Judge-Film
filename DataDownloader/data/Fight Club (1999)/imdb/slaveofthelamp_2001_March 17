When I first saw this movie, I had no idea what to expect. I certainly
didn't expect it to become one of my most favorite movie of all time. I
REALLY didn't expect to see such an amazing, funny, and powerful film.
Finally, this generation has its masterpiece movie. David Fincher did an
amazing job directing and the script was impeccable (It was very true to
the
book). Norton and Pitt showed outstanding performances, ones which should
have gotten some recognition by a certain academy.... This film will be
remembered for years to come.<br /><br />Rating 10 out of 10  (The only one I've given)
