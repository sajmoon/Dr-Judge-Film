I must admit, when I first heard about Fight Club I thought it was just
another Brad Pitt film which would have no depth or storyline.  Then when
I
discovered it co-starred the wonderful and extremely talented Edward
Norton
AND directed by David Fincher (the man who gave us Se7en), I just had to
see
it.<br /><br />Fight Club left me dumbfounded.  Never before have I walked out of a
cinema
feeling that I have to sit through a film all over again.<br /><br />The sheer brilliance of the plot, the acting, the script and the direction
(not to mention the twists) makes Fight Club probably the best film of
1999
and one of the top ten films of the 1990's (we must not forget the
brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption, Gods and Monsters and Leon).<br /><br />Brad Pitt was wonderful as Tyler - I must admit I was surprised by how
well
he did.  Edward Norton was perfect as the Narrator, he was so sarcastic
and
so very convincing.  I cannot believe that the Academy didn't nominate him
for a third time - his performance in Fight Club equaled that of American
History X and was almost on par with Primal Fear.  I must admit, I'm not
Helena Bonham Carter's biggest fan, but she did bring something to Marla's
character that was truly amazing.<br /><br />As Tyler says - &quot;The first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about
Fight Club&quot;.  To be truthful, it's the only thing I COULD talk about and I
reckon it will be the same for anybody.
