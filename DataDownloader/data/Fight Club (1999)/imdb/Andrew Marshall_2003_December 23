This isn't the sort of film that people will be on the fence about - you'll
either love it or hate it and I'm in the love it camp. All of the leads turn
in their best performances and when these are Pitt, Norton, &amp; Bonham-Carter
you're onto a winner. Jack is living a humdrum life until he meets Tyler
Durden who changes it in the most dramatic fashion. I'll not spoil the
twist, but the film does lose it's way a little towards the end. I think
Norton steels the show and must be one of the finest actors around Hollywood
at the moment.
