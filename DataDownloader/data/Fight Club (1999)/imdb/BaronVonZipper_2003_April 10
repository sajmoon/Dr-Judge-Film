Fight Club is probably one of the best out there. It's part social
commentary,part action, and part drama. It's the tale of a depressed man
and
his struggle against the system. I liked the fight scenes and some of the
jokes. It's a little slow at first but if you stick with it up to when
Jack
meets Tyler Durden it picks up from there on.
