Well I must say I did not get this movie for the most part.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were awesome in their roles.  I think the
acting
was great and Mr Pitt always seems to not be bothered by mainstream
because
he never seems to take on the same role nor does he seem to take on roles
just for the $.
Though I did hear and see the underlying comments of what was almost a
socialist point of view (the idea of becoming a corporate slaves) it also
has these amazing fight scenes.  I know this sounds like I like it right?
Well though I can say the fights were amazing I did not like them.  I am
not
one to sit and see fights real or fake, I guess that is what it was
intended
to do.  To show us what the world had come to... I am glad I was told to
wait and watch the end of the movie, though for a good portion of it I was
complaining about the violence.<br /><br />But for the most part it was ok. The anarchist ideas were interesting in
the
movie, not somehting I suggest we lean toward but nevertheless
interesting.
Where the light bulb clicked though was in the thought  that in this
corporate society we are all a little like Sybil.
