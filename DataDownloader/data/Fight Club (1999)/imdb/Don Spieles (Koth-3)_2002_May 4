Do not rent this movie unless you have the whole weekend!  I guarantee you
that it will be necessary.  Fight club it one of those films that the more
you watch it, the more you want to watch it.  The intricacy of the story,
combined with the hidden truth and the sarcastic humor make this in the list
of my to ten films of all time.  But don't take my word for it.  See it
today, just schedule accordingly!
