I loved this movie!!! It succeeded in mushing up the difference between
imaginary and truth. The characters have unreal connections and
interactions
which cause you to go &quot;huh!?!&quot; before the movie is over. The fantastical
backdrops, out-there characters, and hard-edged music make it impossible
to
take your eyes off the screen. And I promise, you will be repeating the
dialogue for days. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed. I give it a
9/10! Remember, don't become a slave to the Ikea catalogue.
