I think this is a top-fifty all-time movie, although it may never receive
that type of acclaim.  It has all the necessary ingredients:  Great
script,
suspense, drama, action, dark humor, romance, and incredible performances.
Anyone who has ever dismissed Pitt as a lightweight or pretty boy should
see
this movie.  The man has substantial talent.  He's riveting in this role.
Norton is a favorite of mine; he's got tremendous physical talent and it
comes across in all of his work.  He's perfectly cast in this movie.  He
handles the transisitions of the character beautifully.<br /><br />The violence and anti-social messages of the film will keep it from being
a
widespread favorite, which is a shame, because it deserves to be near the
top of the great movie list.<br /><br />I'd say more, but the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about
Fight Club.
