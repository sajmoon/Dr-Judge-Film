1999_December 13 
<br /><br />To be honest, the initial reason why I wanted to see Fight Club was
solely because I am a die-hard Edward Norton fan. I had no idea what to
expect from it but I am not a fan of action movies and i had stupidly
pegged
this movie as just that. Thank GOD I saw it anyway!!!<br /><br />First off, I have to say that this was perhaps Edward Norton's best
performance to date. He was stunning and got more quality screen time in
Fight Club than he has had in others, despite being called a &quot;narcisstic
dilettante&quot; by the director of American History X due to his alleged
destruction of the movie to fit in more scenes of himself.<br /><br />But to be fair, this was also Brad Pitt's movie, and deservedly so. He
shone in his role of Tyler Durden. Admittedly, I am very much NOT a fan of
Brad Pitt but I will give him his due. This was his role,and this is the
kind of role he should stick to. Hopefully, he will now realise that he
wasn't born to play romantic heroes, but anti-hero protagonists (if that's
what you could call Tyler Durden).<br /><br />Direction was also excellent. Dark and startlingly atmospheric. I
thought
that the darkness was beautifully used. My major problem with Fincher's
other major box-office success, &quot;Seven&quot; was it's darkness. I thought that
much of it's atmosphere got lost in it. However it seems Fincher has most
certainly perfected the art of darkness in Fight Club (it truly is an
art).<br /><br />The storyline is consistently intriguing, and bitingly funny, despite
it's blackness (and I mean the stinking- neverending-pits-of-Hell sort of
blackness). I caught myself a thousand times laughing and grimacing at the
same time. The hilarious humour, coupled with some of the most quotable
dialogue and monologue in movie history, makes this certainly the best
written screenplay of the nineties, if not the century.<br /><br />So, hopefully, we will see the name &quot;Fight Club&quot; and many of the names
assoiated with it pop up again with the Oscar nominations (fingers crossed
for Edward Norton people. Third time's the charm).<br /><br />If you have yet to see this movie, then SEE IT. Because it is most
certainly movie of the year, and ranking as one of the top films of the
nineties. Destined to follow in the footsteps of The Shawshank Redemption
as
not fully appreciated until video release.
