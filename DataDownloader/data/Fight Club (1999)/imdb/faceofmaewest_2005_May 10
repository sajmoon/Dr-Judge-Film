This movie is my all-time favorite! It blows other movies out of the
water because of its amazing cinematography, brilliant acting, and
unique script. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are
brilliant. This film makes up its own rules and is a leader not a
follower. The reason there aren't any other movies out there like this
is because nobody was smart enough to come up with anything like it
before, and nobody has the talent to mimic it now. Your genre may be
comedy, it may be tragedy, but I have never met anybody who genuinely
hates this movie. Once you see this movie, you'll never think the same
again. If this flick has an effect on you like it had on me, it will
change your life. There's a new term for thinking outside the box and
it is Fight Club.
