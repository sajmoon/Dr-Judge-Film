Fight Club is an amazing film, it is also a very disturbing film. Fight
Club is also one of the few movies that can change your life, or at
least how you look at it. The story is extremely good, and as a warning
it's very, very disturbing, and very hard to explain much about it
without giving the hole movie away. The screenplay should have won an
Oscar, the dialogue is amazing, the characters amazing, and just how
they put everything together is amazing. The acting is amazing, some of
the best ever filmed, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham
Carter are all completely amazing. The direction is a little weaker,
but not by any means bad. Fincher has a way of putting his characters,
and audience through hell, and making the audience love it. The visual
effects are also amazing, and always look very real, and very
disturbing. I love this movie, I love every little thing about it.
