Fight Club is just amazing. You combind a good a controversial story with
two of the most talented actors of today (Norton and Pitt) and with the
excellent style of David Fincher you have an brilliant
film.<br /><br />I like it because of the satire in the film. Jack (Norton) just hates his
life and he wants to change it. It is full of black humor and sometimes
it's
just weird (but that's good!). I do not think that there is to much
violence
because I think the violence is used functional.<br /><br />Everbody should see this movie because it is most definately the best
satire
ever made.
