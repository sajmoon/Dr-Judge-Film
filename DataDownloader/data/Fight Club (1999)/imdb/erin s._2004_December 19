Watched this movie the day after Thanksgiving. Watched it again on
Saturday. And Sunday. And Monday. And Tuesday. And Wednesday. And
Thursday. Bought it Friday. I've read the book twice now. I've seen the
movie... ten(?) times. I love this movie! I'd give it ten stars! I'd
recommend for everyone to see the masterpiece made from Chuck
Palahunuik's novel! And if I ever wrote a book, the guy who wrote this
screen play is doing the movie of MY novel. But seriously, this movie
has it all: well-crafted plot, intriguing angles, comedy, action,
drama, mystery, MPD, good music, nice shots, great directing, awesome
acting. Seriously, this movie is my favorite movie, and I don't usually
like movies that much. This is a HAVE-TO-SEE movie!
