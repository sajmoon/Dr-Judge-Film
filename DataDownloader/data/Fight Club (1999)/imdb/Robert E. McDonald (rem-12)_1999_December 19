1999_December 19 

This movie has similarities, in style only, to Full Metal Jacket, because
it
starts off quite lighthearted but halfway through it turns from comedy to
very serious and quite gruesome.
It has a nice twist at the end, similar to a recent film I won't mention,
for fear of giving away too much of the story.  If you are expecting simply
a bare-knuckle fight movie then you will be disappointed, but
glad!
