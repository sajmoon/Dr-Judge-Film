Going into FIGHT CLUB, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. All I had really
seen of the movie was a bunch of sweaty, bloody men fighting in a basement
with others watching and cheering them on... But then, I had also heard from
many people that it was exceedingly good. Hence my uncertainty.<br /><br />What I got, I certainly wasn't prepared for.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB is so much more than just sweaty men beating each other up. It
is, in reality, a truly brilliant film about the world we live in and our
lives--how pathetic and pointless they may actually be. It is filled with
satire and social commentary, and is easily the most thought-provoking film
I've seen in a long, long time. Anybody who can't see the symbolism of Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), or the Narrator (Edward Norton), or basically any of the
characters, or of the fight clubs themselves, must have a heart of steel,
and a brain of such.<br /><br />Sure, on the surface, FIGHT CLUB isn't much. Well, it is, but it's when you
have the intellect and experience that you can dig deeper and uncover the
film's true brilliance. It's there.<br /><br />On top of its brilliant use of satire and irony, FIGHT CLUB is still an
excellent film. Everything from the direction, to the script, to the actors
(all of which surprised me in being very good, namely Norton and Pitt) is
exceptional. From the opening moment you get drawn in to the lives of
everyday characters with true depth to them, and you're in for one hell of a
film. You'll laugh throughout, find links and morals to our society and our
role in society as consumers, and find yourself marveling at the absolutely
epic closing shot.<br /><br />I hadn't yet found a film that I will readily give a perfect score, a 10 out
of 10. FIGHT CLUB is the first. 10/10.
