Fight club... the most intelligent work of the director David Fincher
till date. The main cast include Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena
Bonham Carter... all well suited to their roles.<br /><br />After watching the American History X (1998) i understood that Edward
Norton is an actor who can handle any sort of role exceptionally well.
he proved the same here as well. But the one who completely surprised
me in Fight Club was Brad Pitt. His character was so cleverly plotted
that it bears the entire base of the movie over its shoulders. i
doesn&#x27;t want to go much deeper into this character otherwise it will
ruin the entire excitement of the viewer.<br /><br />There are only two mystery thrillers that i personally believe can
compete with Fight Club. One is the Usual Suspects (1995) and the
second is Reservoir Dogs(1992).<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t watched this film till date then don&#x27;t wait further and
watch this film now. I strongly recommend Fight Club to you.
exceptional film.... 10/10
