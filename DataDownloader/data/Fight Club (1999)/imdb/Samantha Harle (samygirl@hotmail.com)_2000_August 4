Wow.  This movie is definitely not for the weak at heart.  I was amazed
cinematicly this movie was....indescribable!  I was in awe of Brad Pitt's
energy throughout the entire film.  Of course I cannot forget Edward
Norton's very convincing portrayal of a man at his wits end with life.
You
have to see this movie to believe it!
