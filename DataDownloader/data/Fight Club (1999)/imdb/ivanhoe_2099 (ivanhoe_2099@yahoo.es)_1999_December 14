David Fincher take us in his roller coaster again and the trip sure makes
your mind blow up . An excellent story, with a powerful  visual strength.
the
interpretations (Edward Norton mostly)are credible and vibrating. it&acute;s a
surrealistic travel into the 90&uml;s American way of life. A genial
movie!
