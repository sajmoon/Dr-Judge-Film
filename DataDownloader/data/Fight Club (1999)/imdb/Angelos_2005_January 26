Frankly, it is the movie that will make you realize Pitt is actually an
actor.I had some difficulty accepting that,having always endorsed the
view that beautiful people are usually just that.Surprise!!!He is, in
fact, a very decent actor.<br /><br />I will not even comment on Norton.His acting is were it is supposed to
be,right at the top.<br /><br />The story is powerful and full of meaning, given in a surreal
environment that compliments the acting of all actors.Mind you, it is
far from clean or proper,it is just right!<br /><br />Watch this movie,you'll be surprised to find out it concerns you more
than you would imagine...
