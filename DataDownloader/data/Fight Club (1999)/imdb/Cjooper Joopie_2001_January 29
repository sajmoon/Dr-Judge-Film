The Movie Fight Club is an example of one of those very dark and risky
movie
that is for some reason made into a movie even though it might not do
financially well.  The first time I heard of Fight Club was when I saw an
article about it in a magazine and how it kept being pushed back on its
release date due to it's violent nature and the situation the country was
currently in.  When it finally came out in October I had seen a string of
disappointing films and didn't feel like seeing this one.  A while after I
had nothing to do so I went and saw it.  When I left the theater I
couldn't
absorb the entire movie but I did know that it was a rare film and one I
had
never seen before.  What puts Fight Club above other films is how it's
message isn't cut and dry.  It says dangerous things that aren't
questioned
often.  This film questions are lifestyles, belongings, and ideas.  The
most
appealing thing about Fight Club is that it takes you away to a different
place with characters that you have never seen before, this film goes
right
alongside The Talented Mr. Ripley as the best of 1999.
