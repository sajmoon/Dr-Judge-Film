Man, oh man! The issues this movie tackles, and achieves so well in doing,
is just totally brilliant. The ending was the best ending I have experienced
in years. Fantastic plot development. Totally enthralling. Most women would
probably find the whole plot concept totally sickening but then I'm more
than likely wrong here. A lady said to me, &quot;That men wouldn't like 'Thelma
and Louise'&quot;, a movie with a similar statement for women as the 'Fight club'
is for men, however I rated it one of my best movies ever- like the 'Fight
Club', as the human issues delt with, go far deeper than what is presented
on the surface. Watch it at the surface level and be thoroughly entertained;
or watch it intuitively and be enthralled and knocked out for months by what
this movie conveys about man's struggle for identity, in a now woman
dominated world.
