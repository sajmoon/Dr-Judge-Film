From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love
with it.<br /><br />Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will
see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think
that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be
because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.<br /><br />Though it is not right to call it Fincher&#39;s. As the film is adapted
from Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s book which I must add is just as great. This is
Chuck&#39;s masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck&#39;s is a
book ending and David&#39;s is a film ending. Making both perfect.<br /><br />The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the
Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to
cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in
self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And
joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a
routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him
feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds
of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn&#39;t have to say anything at
all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable,
she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She
is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn&#39;t sleep.
He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his
time on planes flying around America.<br /><br />Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he
met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to
his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens.
He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at
Tyler&#39;s place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest
lines in film history. &#39;I want you to hit me as hard as you can&#39;. Fight
Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a
lot of men join. Tyler&#39;s place is a complete mess. The house looks like
its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his
job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs.
Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes
back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new
religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight
Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the
mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping.
But I&#39;m going to let you find that out for yourself.<br /><br />The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his
feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time
for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are
influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words
running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does
not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow
the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with
evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we
are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way
to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as
she feels incomplete too.<br /><br />The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It&#39;s
about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will
kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man
in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots
exactly, but general roots of the gender. It&#39;s not pointless violence.
It&#39;s meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not
because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through
puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a
spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every
time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I
love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour
make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant,
and I must say cool. I couldn&#39;t imagine anyone else playing these
parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be
remembered for Tyler Durden.<br /><br />This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I
recommend you join the club if you haven&#39;t seen it already, as you will
probably not be able to resist.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t get any better than this.<br /><br />10/10 Enjoy&#133;
