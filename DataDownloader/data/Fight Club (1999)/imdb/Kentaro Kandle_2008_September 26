Without spoiling it for those who haven&#39;t yet seen it, Fight Club gets
better every time I re-watch it. There is so much attention to subtle
(and even subliminal) messages that I discover something new, or
appreciate some minor nuance, every time I re-watch it.<br /><br />Based on a novel of the same name (which I haven&#39;t read yet), some top
talent and a big budget helped to make a movie which manages to involve
you in the specific characters, whilst at the same time being generic,
general, and abstract enough to be an obvious satire on &quot;modern&quot; life. <br /><br />Unlike most movies, with a sappy fairytale romantic subplot, the sexual
relations in this movie are somewhat broken, since they involve people
who are very broken... but it works and adds realism. Well, I don&#39;t
want to spoil anything so I won&#39;t say anything more. <br /><br />Other people have already reviewed it in detail, so I will just say
that it is worth owning... DVDs were invented for films like this.
