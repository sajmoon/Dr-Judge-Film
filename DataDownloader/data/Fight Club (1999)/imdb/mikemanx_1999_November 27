1999_November 27 

I saw Fight Club with a friend who had seen it the night
before.<br /><br />Afterwards, I couldn't wait to take other friends to see
it.<br /><br />Apart from the subject material, the slick shot direction and entertaining
narration Fight Club has what I believe is becomming a trend in recent
movies - starting with the Sixth Sense.  The inclusion of plot lines that
make seeing the movie again as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable, then the
first time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie immensely, wearing a smirk through most of the scenes.
Very well done, and well directed.
