A lot of words have been spoken/ written/ transmitted about &quot;Fight Club&quot; and
its messages about men who haven't entirely grown up and blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah, but I haven't seen (yet) anyone tackle this movie from a
religious standpoint.<br /><br />First, let me say &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a brilliant movie, and I considered it the
best movie of 1999 (I'm sure that means just tons to everyone).  But here's
why the movie spoke to me -- it seems to me that the filmmakers, whether
consciously or not, are saying that people who grow up with no moral or
spiritual compass to guide them will eventually be morally and spiritually
bankrupt.<br /><br />Tyler even says this in one of the scenes (something along the lines of &quot;our
fathers are our role models for God.  And if they left us, what does that
say about God?&quot;).  Pow.  Tyler believes God's no longer in the picture, so
he can do whatever the heck he wants.  <br /><br />Tyler represents people who've grown up with no belief in God or any sort of
values system that He handed down, and that lack of belief is ultimately
what leads to his extreme behavior.  But the statement of the movie is that
people like Tyler are to be pitied, not revered.
