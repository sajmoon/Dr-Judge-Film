Fight Club I was recommended about this 1999 movie by my office
colleague Bill Piccolo. It sounded like a typical boxing ring movie to
me &#150; but due to the eagerness of suggestion, I thought of viewing it
right away on the borrowed DVD.<br /><br />This is a shocker of a movie! You could hate it or love it. My thoughts
were shifting on the scales from one extreme to the other &#150; what is
going on? What is the purpose of the movie? What is the message of the
movie? What does it want to convey? I had to sleep over the movie
before I sat down to write this review.<br /><br />The movie is about the main protagonist guy &#150; Edward Norton playing an
insomniac, who comes in touch with first with Marla Singer &#150; played by
Helena Carter &#150; and later on with the dynamo of a guy - Tyler Durden &#150;
played brilliantly by Brad Pitt in his bigger than screen performance.
From that time &#150; the movie takes a roller coaster ride to unbelievable
incidences, situations and thought processes that churn the mind out of
the viewers. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton set up a &quot;fight club&quot; that
grows into many cities around US and becomes an underground mayhem
causing outfit. There is a final twist &#150; like all the classic movies
have; that builds up the scope for me to view it again and again! I
think that this is a fantastic movie. Not by the sense of acceptance of
what is going on in the movie &#150; but the narration of a concept that is
so weird. I like movies because it takes one to those areas of human
beings that are not dwelled in before. Many attempts are made to
showcase a dark side of human nature &#150; not many are successful in doing
that. But the director David Fincher &#150; (Alien 3, Se7en, Game and Panic
Room) has created a dynamo of this movie. Hats off to this brilliant
young director! A lot of effort must have gone in preparing for this
cult movie. Small details that are obviously missed during the first
viewing would be revealed after 2-3 viewing &#150; once you know the ending.<br /><br />Edward Norton has played his role to perfection (I had seen him
recently in The Illusionist and found him stone faced), Brad Pitt takes
the guts out of you and his larger than life persona would be
remembered for many years and accomplished actress Helena Carter plays
her role with mysterious oomph and style &#150; great trio on work.<br /><br />The best part of the movie &#150; if you miss it during the first viewing is
its background sound track. Please pay special attention to it &#150; it
carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound
track.<br /><br />It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and
new cinema would also love it. I would surely highly recommend to all
movie-buffs friends.<br /><br />Jut a trivia &#150; this movie is rated number 31 in all time classic lists
of 250. Does not that say a lot about the movie? (Stars 7.75 out of 10)
