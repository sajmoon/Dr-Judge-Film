Alright, well I guess I missed the part where this was supposed to be
one of the most amazing movies ever made. Why did people have orgasms
over this movie? This isn&#39;t even that bad, and in fact I have nothing
negative to say about it, just dumbfounded as to what all the hype is
about.<br /><br />I feel like I was the sole person that watched the &quot;negative&quot; of the
film, while everyone else got to see the developed positive. I don&#39;t
really have anything creative or witty to say here, because again, I
don&#39;t have any criticisms. So uh, yeah, if you like
psychological/thriller/drama type movies, I guess check this out? Don&#39;t
expect it to be life changing though.
