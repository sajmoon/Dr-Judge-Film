This movie reflects society and attacks it simoultaneously. It asks
questions that most wouldn't bother to ponder on.
This movie goes past REASON and what really motivates us, and what could
make us better.<br /><br />Not sayin' any just person should imitate anything depicted in this movie,
but also try askin: How much do you know about yourself if you haven't been
to a fight?<br /><br />Others will find this movie ridiculously overwrought. Some will find it a
rather abstract, and artistic depiction of a man faced with a conundrum
where his world is now influenced by his best friend... (Tyler
Durden)<br /><br />David Fincher is the genius of modern- visual IN YOUR FACE moviemaking and
magnified focus on the subject matter of his movies. Particularly this
one.
His outing after Fight Club - PANIC ROOM is on the other hand totally
different. It tells you to &quot;put brain in door. Enjoy popcorn. Sit back.
Enjoy the movie&quot;.<br /><br />Oops, that's another story.<br /><br />Fight Club is 10/10 in my book.
