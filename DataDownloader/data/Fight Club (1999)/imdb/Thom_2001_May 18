Fight Club has got to be one of the best films ever made, it completely
demonstrates what happens when consumer technology and pop-culture society
takes over our natural order.<br /><br />David Fincher is a genius, he's made one of the most memorable and funny
films any one could possible imagine coming from Chuck Palahniuk's
provocative novel.<br /><br />All the actors make a mark on their characters, especially Edward Norton as
the disillusioned Narrator. I love everything about each Fincher film made,
but fight club contains everything you need in a film. Mischief, mayhem and
soap&#133;<br /><br />
