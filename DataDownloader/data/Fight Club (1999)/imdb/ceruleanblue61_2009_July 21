this movie was awesome! it was well done, exciting, hilarious, and it
seemed to be very relevant to my life. the cast was great and their
acting was superb. this is my favorite movie of all times, the meter
stick against which all other movies have fallen very, very short.<br /><br />To all the haters out there, aka film students and snobs, nothing will
be as good as that which your professors told you was good. yes, i
know, David lynch is the man blah blah blah. you film students rag on
such great movies without making anything yourself. all we&#x27;ve been
getting is garbage recently. why don&#x27;t all you film students get
together and make the epic film that you demand everyone else do?
