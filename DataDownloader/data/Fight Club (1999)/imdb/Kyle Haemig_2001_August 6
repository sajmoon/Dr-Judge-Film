I agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the
DVD.  This movie's defenders have tried to pass it off as &quot;cerebral&quot; and
&quot;psychological&quot; on this very page, and as a &quot;profound portrait of how
corporations ruin our lives.&quot;  It is none of these.  First of all, what
makes people think it's cerebral?  The endless whining?  The laughable
&quot;we're all the middle children of history&quot; attempts at philosophizing?  The
hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pent-up
aggression?  And the leftist idea (which has been out there since at least
the time of Marx) that corporations have been destroying our lives and
screwing us over?  Praise the movie as cerebral, and you'd better be
cerebral yourself to recognize it.  Get yourself a book of Dostoyevsky or
Kant and see how you handle real deep thought.  <br /><br />Second off, that it's psychological.  Simple because the main character has
a certain mental disorder (I won't be so bad to reveal what it is), is it
psychological?  After we see the character's illness in the movie, it seemed
to me Norton fighting Pitt was like a bad Candid Camera joke.  I was
half-expecting the director to come on after the scene and say, &quot;You took
that scene seriously?  Sucker!&quot;  It's amazing what this movie expects you to
believe, particularly after the plot twist which, like the Usual Suspects
(to which it has been often compared) is just too clever by a half, and
voids entire sections of the movie.  <br /><br />I'm a fan of Ed Norton because I like his work.  I also liked Seven quite a
bit, so I can hardly be dismissed as a Fincher-hater.  And I still agree
that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous
generations never had to deal with.  But after seeing this movie, I think
the solution may be worse than the cure.
