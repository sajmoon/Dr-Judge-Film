&quot;Fight Club&quot; by David Fincher is really the first movie since American
Psycho to deal with &quot;generation X&quot; (in lack of a better name). And as the
book by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) was so very provocative and
too
violent for its time, so is Fight Club.<br /><br />The two main characters, &quot;I&quot; (later known as &quot;Jack&quot;) and &quot;Tyler Durden&quot;
are
portrayed by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Both actors become their
characters, and they're very convincing as the fragile, generation x
insomniac (Norton) and the cool, easy-going, care-less, soap-making Tyler
Durden (Pitt). But it is really Helene Bonham-Carter who steals the
limelight with her role as Marla Singer, who just as &quot;Jack&quot; has nothing
really to live for, and who manages to stay alive only by going to
cancer-groups and such for dying people. See the irony?<br /><br />Much can be said of the movie (and it certainly has been!), but as I see
it,
it is able to open the eyes of an entire generation who goes through life
thinking materialism is the way to live. If it does not open your eyes,
you
may just think this movie is about violence, when, in fact, only one
person
dies in the film. The movie is not about violence at all. The violence is
a
way of escaping the life the characters are leading - a life which is so
empty and only based on stuff...things we don't need to be
happy.<br /><br />The ending sees everything coming together for the audience - and
everything
falling apart for the main character. Do you dare watch?
