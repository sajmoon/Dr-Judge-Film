2002_January 7 

Let me say straight away: See this movie. It's absolutely fantastic. It's
one of only a handful (and by that I mean under five) movies where, after
seeing it, I just sat in my seat in the cinema for a few moments because I
was so stunned: It's that good. <br /><br />First of all the story-line. It's obviously counter-culture but it's doing
it with it's tongue firmly lodged in it's cheek (after all it's commenting
on consumerism through a Hollywood movie). It's a well paced storyline. The
only detraction is that the &quot;twist&quot; is sometimes unbelievable in retrospect
and can make the movie seem somewhat silly at times but I can let that
slide.<br /><br />The acting... It's got Edward Norton. He's my favourite actor. I'm left in
awe of him. He's incredibly good. He is the ultimate cynic in this movie.
Brad Pitt perfectly counter-points him and once again shows he is far from
being a pretty boy actor. And Mrs. Carter is just great as Marla - I'll
forever see her as some bizarre Bohemian freak...<br /><br />And now the directing. Wow. A film like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is beautiful in
an epic kind of way. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is creative. There's so many creative
touches that add to this movie. I knew David Fincher was one to watch after
the fantastic &quot;Se7en&quot;. His ability to direct also showed through on &quot;The
Game&quot;. Here however he surpasses himself. It's a visual treat. He keeps the
story moving brilliantly. A scene that could have been rendered somewhat
tiresome by another director has my jaw open here. Whether it's a bizarre
montage of images, an extremely quick cinematic cut or a misaligned frame
Fincher employs an array of skills to make this movie one of the most
memorable looking movies that I have ever seen.<br /><br />In conclusion I say that I can't say enough nice things about &quot;Fight Club&quot;.
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I
recommend that if you haven't seen it that you watch it immediately. And
watch it multiple times. One of the very very few movies I'd give
10/10.
