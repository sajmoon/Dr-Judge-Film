1999_November 7 

Brian Fincher's latest movie is truly a work of art.  One of the most
original movies to come out of Hollywood in a while.  Brad Pitt is amazing
as Tyler Durden, as he once again portrays a great character masterfully,
just as he did in 12 Monkeys and Se7en.  Even the minor details of his
character, such as his night jobs, are pure genius.  Edward Norton also
throws in a great performance as our mentally distraught narrator.  But
what
makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; a great movie is it's truthfulness of what we really
are,
and how we haven't noticed it.  It is put best when Norton talks how when
the galaxy opens up, it will all be named after corporations(Planet
Starbucks).
Now most movie critics bashed Fight Club's ending, which of course I won't
give away.  Personally, I thought it was great.  I recommend seeing it more
than once though.  I just saw it for a third time, and I picked up on
things
that I didn't see the first two times.  I gave it a 9 out of
10.
