Fight Club was an incredible movie.  Not only is it original, but the
acting is superb.  Edward Norton is incredible as the Narrator.  Brad Pitt
is equally as good as Tyler Durden.  David Finchers dark direction and Jim
Uhls screenplay brings to life the story of Mens need to express themselves
and the inability to do so.   This movie is not for the weak at heart,  but
anyone with a sense of humor slightly warped and an appreciation for
originality and an interesting storyline, you should see this movie.<br /><br />One problem, if anyone could actually tell me when the Narrators name is
mentioned as Jeff, I'd appreciate it.  I know where Jack came from, but I
never heard Jeff.  Thanks.
