When I first saw Fight Club, it blew me away; I absolutely ate it up.  The
film itself is superbly acted, well written (screenplay as well as original
novel), and masterfully directed, with exceptionally skillful and subtle
use
of special effects.  One can really tell that this movie was a labor of
love
for everyone involved, from David Fincher to Rhett Wooden.*<br /><br />More than this, though, it was the message that got to me.  This movie in
no
small part led to a drastic shift in my personal outlook on life and my
critical perspective.  I became highly sensitive to - and critical of -
uncontrolled consumerism, individual insulation, and media manipulation,
among other things.  I can honestly say that this movie helped change my
life.<br /><br />After time and subsequent viewings, however, I have become more critical of
Fight Club.  Isn't Tyler Durden - and thus, through his less-than-subtle
preachiness, the movie itself - practicing the same force-feeding of
ideology on Ed Norton's narrator and his &quot;space monkeys&quot; that he spends the
whole movie railing against?  Isn't this movie, as a prepackaged, glitzy
media spectacle, just another element of the mass media fixation and
dependency that the narrator is trying to escape?  Other critics have said
as much, and denounced the movie for hypocrisy and didacticism.<br /><br />However, one ought to consider the idea that the medium itself is always a
part of the message.  The movie itself hints at this, as Brad Pitt's
mischievous character (think Puck meets Travis Bickle) splices pornographic
images into movies even as the viewer sees images of Brad spliced into
Fight
Club occasionally.  Think the irony of Hollywood Hunk Brad Pitt cast as the
character who proclaims, &quot;We're all brought up to believe that we'll be
movie gods and rock stars, but we won't,&quot; is accidental?<br /><br />If someone watches Fight Club and latches on to the message with intensity,
like I did, then obviously that person needed to hear what Tyler Durden had
to say, and had to hear it from Brad Pitt's famous &amp; attractive mouth.
Conversely, if someone watches Fight Club and is able to say &quot;that movie,
while nicely executed, is overly preachy and hypocritical in its stated
purpose,&quot; then that someone is independent enough of media not to need the
media/cultural liberation that Fight Club preaches.<br /><br />That's what Fight Club's about, really - breaking free from cultural
restraint of all kinds, even the restraints that allowed the genesis of
that
freedom.  It's about questioning everything - especially ads, magazines,
TV,
and - you guessed it - big-budget movies that tell you how to live your
life.  So, while I've become more critical of Fight Club than I was
originally, I only respect the movie that much more for its ability to
subject itself to the same scrutiny it gives everything
else.<br /><br />For these reasons and more, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the
decade, and may well prove to be one of the defining movies of our
generation, like The Graduate for the 60s and Saturday Night Fever for the
70s.<br /><br />I highly recommend consumption of Fight Club in any form, although this is
one rare instance where I think film is the better-suited medium over
print.
I do have a beef with the movie's adaptation of the ending (considerably
happier than the novel's), but that just enforces the idea that the movie
itself isn't free from the trappings of Hollywood.<br /><br />The DVD is especially high-quality, with insightful commentary from the
novelist, screenwriter, director, and main players (notably film buff
Norton).<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />*David Fincher is the director.  Rhett Woodon is the best boy grip.  In
Fight Club, everyone has a name.
