this film is an excellent film in many ways it is so psychological and
thrilling at the same time, it gives us a message about life, and while
that message maybe at times exaggerated in this film, it is more or
less true people are always strugling to free themselves, so they
create their own fantasies, their won worlds where they are the center
of attention, it is amazing how i can relate to this and I'm sure many
of you here as well...<br /><br />I'm not saying that i have insomnia or that I'm schizophrenic but it is
a general feeling felt by many people that their lives are nothing in
the grand scheme of things and that we wish for change , however when
we get this change we realize how wrong we in the first place.<br /><br />this movie is in my opinion one of the best written films of all time,
and should've got awards and Oscars for it.<br /><br />surely this film is always entertaining to watch and i always learn
something about life whenever i watch it over and over again//.truly a
deep film...
