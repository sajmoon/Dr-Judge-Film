Unpredictable plot, brilliant camera work, outstanding acting. This was
about as good as it gets. Usually Hollywood films are so formularised,
as soon as they start you find yourself going &quot;OK, thats the bad guy,
thats the hero, this is the love interest, this is how it will end....&quot;
Not so with Fight Club. Its a pity more movies like this don't get
made. Helena Bonham Carter is radically transformed from her previous
roles as Jack's girlfriend, while Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are
perfectly cast for their roles. Meatloaf also features as steroid
casualty. The Fight Club they create is perfectly juxtaposed with the
support groups. Instead of seeking emotional release from catharsis,
they seek it through violence, turning the support group premise on its
head.
