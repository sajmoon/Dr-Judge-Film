It could be nice to construct this comment the same macabre and ironic way
the movie was done, but I won't.<br /><br />I went to see this movie in a theater only months after its release, because
I thought it would be some kind of Van Damme flick about streetfighters. 
However, I heard that it was a good movie from some respected friends.  So
finally I saw it and wished I did earlier.  The movie title couldn't be more
wrong.  This is NOT a flat BudSpencer/TerenceHill flick about people hitting
each other over the head.  No reactionary or fascist ideas and not a
gladiator flick either.  The story is actually about people searching for
completeness and the futile need for material things and above all about
presence of mind.  The quest for reality (and luck) simply runs out of
control.<br /><br />It's a great cinematic experience: some CGI but very appropriately used. 
Don't let the number of visual FX crew members (42! +10 for special FX) fool
you: it really doesn't get overdone.  However, some visual insider jokes are
probably best appreciated by professionals and filmschool students (which I
am not).  I simply cannot wait to see the next movie by cinematographer Jeff
Cronenweth and, of course, David Fincher.<br /><br />You're probably not 'complete' until you have seen this movie.  But watch it
with a critical eye, I might add, because the irony and cynicism must be
separated from the sincere.  David Fincher makes any Hitchcock look like
greasy kid stuff.  This is probably the superlative of any Hitchcock movie. 
Fincher seems to dictate Hollywood already.<br /><br />Why o why can't we vote 11 :((
