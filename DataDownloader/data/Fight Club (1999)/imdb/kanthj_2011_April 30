It is a movie with excellent screenplay and story. I love the way
Bradpit as Tyler Durden and Edward Norton, the narrator of the movie
acting together. Its mind blowing movie when you see it alone. David
Fincher who is one of the finest director in Hollywood done no mistake
on this film.<br /><br />This film is about forming a club by Tyler Durden called fight club to
fight each other. Almost all folks can relate to the main character,
and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story. This, is
partially due to the excellent directing by David Fincher.<br /><br />Please do see this film. It is no miss film ever made in Hollywood.I
honestly loved this film, the story is awesome, and the execution from
novel to motion picture is brilliant by director.
