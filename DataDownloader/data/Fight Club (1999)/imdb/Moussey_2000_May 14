One word sums up this film: Insane.  Actually, I guess &quot;amazing&quot; and
&quot;spectacular&quot; could fit in there somewhere.  This film is a twisted look
in
to what is wrong with society.  The acting was incredible, the camera work
was fantastic, and the plot took some unpredictable twists.  The acting
was
superb.  Oh yeah, it's pretty violent in spots, and is very, very dark and
insane.  I can see how some people wouldn't like this film, but it was
fantastic to me.  Truly a great film, it makes my Top 10.
