This movie is a dizzying tour through the life of an everyday American
who has snapped.  It's a shock on some levels to see not only the
delusions
that one person can suffer from when they've had enough, but to see so
many
other people buy into his delusions.  The tricky plot is pulled off to
perfection by a trio of great performances by Pitt, Norton, and
Bonham-Carter.  I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a movie with a
riveting and surprising (and even occasionally disturbing) story line
(i.e.,
if you enjoy Van Damme films, you will not like this one).
