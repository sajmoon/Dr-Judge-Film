This movie is about what happens when we find our lives devoid of purpose
and meaning.. and even challenges.<br /><br />And, screw Nietsche!  You don't have to be a Soc or Psyche major to
understand it.  You only have to live through a few disappointments in
life.<br /><br />In fact, I didnt even find the violence to be all that graphic.  We are
raising a society of weinies, folks and sooner or later there's gonna be an
explosion.  <br /><br />It happens today.. what do you REALLY think motivates all the mindless
violence and drive-by's.  It's the search for the catharsis of survival in a
to-the-brink combat.<br /><br />These guys just want to feel alive.
