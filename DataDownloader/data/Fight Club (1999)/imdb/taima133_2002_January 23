The thing that really stands out with this film is the ending. In all my
years of watching film I don't believe of seen a film which has a story as
creative as this one with the most incredible twist towards the end that
no
one could have ever seen comming. A real modern day classic and one that
made me stand up and take a look at were are society is heading.
