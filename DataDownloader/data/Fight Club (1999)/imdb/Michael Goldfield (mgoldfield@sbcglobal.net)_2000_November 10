This heavily hyped film is first rate trash. I'm surprised I had the
patience to watch it for an hour.<br /><br />I cannot recall another film quite this boring. However, if you think you
can derive pleasure from watching young men beat one another up for no
other
reason than they like to beat one another up, this film is for
you.<br /><br />For me, it was a waste of time!
