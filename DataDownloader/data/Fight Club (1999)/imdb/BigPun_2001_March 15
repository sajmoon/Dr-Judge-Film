Fight club is the best film of 99 and the best film made in the nineties.
It
is by far the most surreal and atmospheric cinematic peace made in many
years and will go down as the pinnacle movie of the 90's generation of
detachement and commercialism. An excellent film with outstanding
performances, directing and cinematagrophy. It is perfect.
