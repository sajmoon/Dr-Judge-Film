I dont know If I'm going to ever forget this movie.  Fincher pushes every
button imaginable to leave the viewer amazed.  I found myself smiling for
most of the movie, why?  Because it was so smart!  The parts where I wasnt
smiling, I was cringing from some of the mind blowing scenes.<br /><br />I loved everything about this movie.  Helena Bonham Carter was amazing,
Brad Pitt was in top form, I've always liked him.  But most of all, Edward
Norton, this guy is so pure in his acting.  He was terrific and perfectly
cast for the nameless narrator.  Him and Kevin Spacey amaze me everytime I
watch them.  The ending to me was perfect.  &gt;
!
Yep, I will never forget this movie!  It's definitely forever etched in
my
mind.  Sad thing is, no oscars will come of this movie, and thats shame.
Fight Club to me is already a classic!
