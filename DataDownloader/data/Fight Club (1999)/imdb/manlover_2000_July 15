This movie is not that good. After seeing this movie, I wouldn't ever pay
cash money to see this again. I will never rent this movie again. I
probably
wouldn't watch it on TV if it came on. It's really that bad. $3.50 is not
worth watching this movie. Do not rent it. It is awful. My reason for this
opinion is the fact that it doesn't make sense in most scenes. The part
where he's burning his hand is fairly impossible. The ending is really bad.
I mean, it's so bad that I almost threw a flower pot at the TV screen. And
don't be misled by the title. It's not really about a fight club, it's
about
something more absurd. Edward Norton did the best job he could with this
lousy script, and even Brad Pitt did a mediocre job. The surprise ending is
nothing like The Sixth Sense. I'd rather see that movie twenty more times
rather than see 5 minutes from Fight Club. I've read some comments about
this movie, and I don't know what you guys are talking about. It's not that
good. Some plot twists does not make for good movie making. This movie is
on
the level of Judge Dredd. No wait, Judge Dredd isn't this
bad.
