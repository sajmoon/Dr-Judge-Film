I can't remember where exactly I first heard the term &quot;head trip&quot;. Maybe
it
was this site. Maybe it was somewhere else. That's not important. But one
thing I can tell you....<br /><br />The phrase &quot;head trip&quot; was invented for this movie.<br /><br />This movie will warp everything you ever thought you knew about life.
Everything you ever thought about death. Everything you ever thought about
anything.<br /><br />A brilliant film, with Norton giving a shockingly realistic performance,
and
Pitt trying to distort Norton in every way possible.<br /><br />With a great start, an unbelievable middle, and the 2nd best movie ending
ever, only next to Usual Suspects, this movie will really give your brain
a
cerebral workout.<br /><br />And don't forget to watch it again. It makes more sense then
sometimes.
