If you saw Fight Club and felt ambivalent about it, see it again, this film
is only benefitted by a second viewing. If you saw Fight Club and hated it,
then, well, you're just insane. And this is why. Fight Club is NOT ABOUT
violence, or fighting. It is about feeling, about leaving one's cubicle in
the detached corporate world of America and getting in touch with people,
places, and in turn, one's self. It is idealistic, and the oh-so-effective
irony of the film is that today, even idealists have to be dark, have to be
loud, have to be violent to envision their better world. Tyler can't come
at
people with a message of hope, or of simplicity right off the bat- he has
to
teach them through what they know.<br /><br />The directing by David Fincher is wonderful (he's really always been a
noteworthy director, Fight Club just magnifies his talent because of its
subject matter), Edward Norton is an insanely good actor, and the script is
superb. For those angry at the plot twist, why? I ask. It most certainly
causes you to reevaluate the entire film (which is why I wholly recommend a
second viewing), as a good twist should.<br /><br />Apologies for the long-windedness and roundabout nature of this review, I
am
just a very passionate supporter of this film and am truly saddened by
those
who don't share this attitude. My point is, don't be turned off by the
Fighting aspect of Fight Club. Look deeper, really take it in, because it
is
not a film about beating people up. It is about reconnecting, about taking
chances, about giving up the multitude of irrational fears that each and
every one of us possess in order to truly feel and experience life. For all
its dark grimness, I think it is a beautiful and moving film. I recommend
it
to all.
