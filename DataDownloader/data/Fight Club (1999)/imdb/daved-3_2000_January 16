   Fight Club is one of the strangest films I have ever seen, with a plot
twist more surprising and presaged better than the twists in Sixth Sense or
Magnolia.  I'm not sure it all makes sense, but with such imaginative
direction and writing, and solid acting by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who
cares?  With so many formula films, it's unusual to be honestly surprised by
a movie, and Fight Club surprised me more than any film I can remember. 
It's not for the squeamish, and it runs a little too long (ever since
Titanic no major filmmaker brings in a final cut under 2 1/2 hours), but it
is a roller coaster ride with no safety bar.
