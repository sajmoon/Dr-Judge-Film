Fight Club is definitely not what I expected. I thought I knew what the film
was about from the commercials. I was wrong. I mean REALLY wrong. I walked
out of the theatre not knowing what it was that I just watched. Was it a
dark comedy? Social commentary? Commercial satire? An exercise in style over
substance? I don't know. Maybe all of the above, maybe none. I think it is a
mistake to over analyse this movie. And let's face it, the media made way to
big of a deal about the violence in this movie. I remember one station
reporting that there was some fear that real life &quot;fight clubs&quot; would start
springing up around the country. Get real. The fact is, most guys don't like
to get in fights, or more specifically, they don't like to be hit. Maybe
after a couple or ten beers, but not usually. It's taken me three or four
viewings to fully appreciate this film. The directing is excellent. Fincher
is a huge talent, and with this and Se7en on his resume, he's the kind of
filmmaker that you know you're going to get something interesting from. Pitt
can be great when he picks the right parts. And Norton is easily my
favourite young actor. He always comes through. I don't really believe in a
lot of the ideas that Fight Club pushes, but it's interesting none the less.
And there are a lot of laughs between the gruesome beatings. Just don't take
it too seriously, and you'll be okay. I give it an 8/10 stars.
G'night!
