A young man finds escape from his boring job, frustrations, alienation,
and
lack of identity through a underground fight club.  The problems ensue
when
it becomes even more complex and dangerous than at first
perceived.<br /><br />The story rather sharply looks at the very thin line between the
mainstream
and the underground.  How conformity and the American dream can actually
be
the catalyst to nonconformity and the American nightmare. It astutely
examines the fact that there is a lot of unrecognized ticking time bombs
right here in our midst.  The problems with the film really lies in the
direction, which runs both good and bad.<br /><br />Finchers direction is good in that he matches the bleached out color of
his
print with a almost in your face analysis of the degeneration of his
characters, with almost no let up.  He also includes some 'subliminal
messages', which are kind of fun. (so pay attention!)<br /><br />His direction is bad with his overuse of dazzling camera work and
computerized effects.  This should only be used if it can help accentuate
the scene or define a character, but here it does nothing but drown out
the
story and make it look like a video game instead of a movie.  Having the
camera glide thru the garbage in someone's trash can is nothing more than
indulgence by the director to boast his cutting edge technological
prowess.
Also with all of todays 'advanced' effects it's amazing how easy it is to
tell when it's been computerized.  For instance the penguin (another
example
of unnecessary indulgence) the second you see him you know he's been
generated and is not real.<br /><br />It's interesting that out of all their effects only two things seem to
remain.  The rundown, abandoned house the two men live in leaves the most
lasting impression and the scene with the exploding skyscrapers looks as
tacky as any 50's Japanese Godzilla flick.  You may have come a long way
baby, but you still have a long way to go.<br /><br />The plot has too many quirky and unnecessary story lines and characters
(especially Carters) that almost make it convoluted.  The scenes hopscotch
between savage humor, gritty drama, and psychological thriller.  Put
together and they tend to contradict each other and hurt the overall
cohesion.  Although it stays metaphorically strong it becomes so overly
exaggerated that by the end it losses it's overall  impact.  In fact the
ending is kind of like killing a ranting lunatic.  Your just glad it's
over
so it can't get anymore wildly incredulous than it already
has.<br /><br />Meat Loaf has his finest role since ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW playing the
unforgettable Robert Paulson.
