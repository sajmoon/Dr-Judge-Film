fight Club is the best film i have ever seen.  it is brainless, yet
thought-provoking, arty yet violent, sickening yet addictive.  The
soundtrack is good, the directing is inspired, the actors are brilliant,
the
ending is the best ending to a film i have ever seen.  i have seen it
three
times at the cinema and i never got bored when I watched it again.  Fight
Club should be held up in the air and praised, showered with rose petals
and
bathed in wine.  I love it, and if you don`t, watch it
again.
