Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working
dead.
It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually
stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher
(Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and
time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward
Norton
is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac
who
catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as
Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house
and
makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as
Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their
lives.
Her role is critical and she plays it well.<br /><br />There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is
not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is
much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster.
This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American
Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message.
If
you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful
bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also
a
huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The
Sixth
Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really
love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but
anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the
best films of 1999.
