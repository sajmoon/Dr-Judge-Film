Fight Club is a rollercoaster, but one that doesn't stop. I can watch this
movie over, and over, and over again.<br /><br />The script is funny and clever, the scenes are dark and imaganative. The
actors do a great job, and the soundtrack fits perfectly in. A classic,
for
those who didn't like it, read the book or take happy pill, perhaps then
you
will understand what is being told here..
