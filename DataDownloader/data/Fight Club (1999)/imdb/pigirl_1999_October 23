1999_October 23 

I've seldom felt so blown-away after leaving a theatre... not
coincidentally, another recent film that left me feeling this way also
starred Edward Norton. Fight Club may be controversial, but that's probably
because many people don't like looking too deep below the surface. As
satire, as pure entertainment, as social commentary, Fight Club excels. It's
not a smooth ride, and there may be some suspension of disbelief required to
take it all in, but isn't that one of the things that fiction is all about?
I hope this won't be ignored at Oscar time.
