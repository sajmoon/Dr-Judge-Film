David Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a disturbing film, but being a David Fincher
film, you expect it be. In a nutshell, Edward Norton plays a
twenty-something white-collar guy drowning in the humdrum shallowness of
yuppie life. Enter free spirit Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is the opposite
of the Edward Norton character, and knows how to turn his life around.
Together they create a club of like-minded males who meet in fetid barroom
basements and conduct savage bare-knuckle fights just for the fun of it.  It
addicts them to violence; soon their lives revolve around the club. It's not
just them, there are young men everywhere locked into low-pay dead-end jobs
for whom smashing faces is just the antidote.  The club spreads like
wildfire and begins to take on fascistic military overtones. And then
there's a plot twist that will blow your mind. Sadly, two major flaws
seriously drag down what should have been an excellent film. First, the
amazing plot twist at the end of the movie (on par with that in &quot;The Sixth
Sense&quot;) doesn't seem to have the serious adherence to it's rules that the
plot twist in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; had. (I must admit I've only watched the
movie once). The other is that the fascistic, nihilistic, and misogyny of
the film is actually celebrated, not ridiculed as many advocates of this
movie assert. This disturbs me a lot, especially when you remember that IMDb
reviewers rank it #40 on the all time favorites list. That's a
bummer.
