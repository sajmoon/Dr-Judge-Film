okay, lets start it off this way: this movie not only has one of the best
plots in movie history, but it also had great writing and awesome fight
scenes . . . AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
The movie is based on the life of a man who's looking for something
different (Edward Norton) other than his daily job.  his insomnia is
making
him insane, yet he fights on.  after going to support groups as a tourist
for emotional expression and help for sleeping, he meets Marla (Helena
Bonham Carter).  Marla is another tourist, but the narrator can no longer
enjoy his emotional outlets with her around, thus he loses sleep again.<br /><br />on a plane going home, he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).
they
talk for a while until the plane gets to their destination and they go
their
own ways.  later, he finds his apartment has been blown to bits and
decides
to call Tyler.  Tyler buys him some beer, and just as they're about to
leave, Tyler asks the narrator to hit Tyler as hard as he can.  shortly
after, fight club is created, and everyone's perception of the world is
changed
for me, this movie really changed my life.  i saw things i have never
seen before.  Chuck Palahniuk did a great job on the book, and an even
better job on the movie.  this is the best movie i have ever seen and i
have
seen more than half the movies on the top 250 list.  the movie was funny,
dramatic and verbally graphic.  if there's one movie you should see, its
this.
