2002_September 1 

You know, I'll be the first to admit that when I first saw a preview for
&quot;Fight Club&quot;, I thought it looked terrible. It appeared to be a movie
where
guys sat around and beat each other up in a senselessly destructive way.
However, my best friend saw it and told me to watch it. He said that I
would
not be let down. And let me tell you: I was not let down at any point.
This
movie is far, far more than I expected. Instead of the movie being &quot;let's
beat each other up because we have no direction&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot; has a
message
of socio-economic change. While I'm not going to go into specifics (and
ruin
the movie), I will say that the point you will get from this movie will be
&quot;Never be content, never be perfect, and never be complete. You will be a
better person for it.&quot;
