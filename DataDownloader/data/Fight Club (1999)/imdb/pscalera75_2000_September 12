The latest Fincher's movie confirms he's probably the most interesting
director today.
As usual in his films, the real meaning can be understood just in the end,
and the second time you watch it, you see every particular in a different
way.
Moreover, it features Norton, who perfectly fits the character of a bored
worker who looks for a way out: this way out is Brad Pitt...
Very original is also the main starting title.
In a few word, a must-see movie: maybe you love it (I think so!), maybe you
have it, but you won't be the same after you see it!
