This movie is much more than just about violence. Yes, the violence is
good; but the plot is more than that. Most of the lines in it teach lessons
in life: &quot;Stuffing feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.&quot; and
&quot;You're not your f***ing khakis.&quot; 
The movie is written as a satire of human life. &quot;Things you own, end up
owning you.&quot;
