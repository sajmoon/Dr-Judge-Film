One of the greatest dark comedies ever shown on the silver screen.
Ultraviolent, absolutely but with a wink. A plot that twists and turns on
itself even into the finale yet which makes absolute sense in retrospect.
A
wonderful combination of director and actors who make the roles work on
many
levels. Brad Pitt displays a quirkiness that I didn't know he had. Also
shows a bit of Dennis Hopper from Apocalypse Now. Edward Norton is the man
floating on the surface of modern life afraid to dive in but yearning to
touch the bottom. Cinematography and editing are flawless as is the
soundtrack. This was the film to see in 1999.
