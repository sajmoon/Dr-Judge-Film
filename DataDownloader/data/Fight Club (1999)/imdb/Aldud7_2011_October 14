So I&#x27;ve read Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s &#x22;Fight club&#x22; and just wanna say a couple
words about it first. This book is written in a very specific way, it&#x27;s
written almost without dialogs, yeah there is lines here and there but
there no dialog it&#x27;s like just a character says something then after a
period of time, after some events are described, another or the same
characters says something and so on and I loved this writing style. It
really stands out and it shows something unique in Palahniuk, something
we haven&#x27;t seen before, something we see in all of his book. Also he
puts a lot of great saying in the book that really lives you thinking.
The book gives a couple of hints which basically, if you smart enough,
unfold the ending long before it. And the last thing - the characters
are really well done. So that&#x27;s all about the book, know the movie. Is
the movie following the book, is it as brutal and mind consuming as the
book? Well actually yes, yes it is. So as for me the strongest point in
the movie is the script, it sticks to the book and its few dialogs but
also it brought as much as to Chuck to say that it&#x27;s an improvement
over the book(well actually I don&#x27;t think so &#x27;cause I prefer the
original ending). I mean - how many script writers can do that? All the
actors did a great job of making there characters look alive(although I
still think that Norton gave his best performers in Primal Fear). Pitt
and Carter is also awesome. So yeah the movie is brutal but there were
some little, great things in the book that weren&#x27;t in the movie which
is a real bummer. From all two Fincher movies that I watched (Seven is
the other) I think this is the best. Oh and yes Fincher did a great job
as well. Watch the movie and if I convinced at list one person to read
the book than my job is done.
