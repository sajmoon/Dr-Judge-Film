1999_October 30 

&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a graphically stylish movie that vainly claims itself to
being a thoughtful film, but whose effect in the end, is to aestheticize and
condone the ideas it purports to examine. It is simply a violent,
anti-social, and misogynist film hiding behind a veil of being a kind of
psycho/social critique or expose on the masculine entity and the effect on
it by North American values.<br /><br />I personally have no problem in the case of a truly artful and intelligent
film making an argument for polemical statement and extremism; this is
definitely not the case here. Content-wise, it is undeftly handled material;
I think because the filmmaker was so utterly concerned with the making of
certain visual moments and lost grip of the whole. I fear for all the angry
young males in our society that may see this film and become inspired to
re-enact the imagery.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; reminds me of a film that may have began as an interesting and
compelling idea, but then in the course of its making, gets &quot;Hollywooded&quot;.
It has several fine visual moments that are in turn subverted by equally
horrible ones. It insults the viewer over and over;  by employing pedantic,
heavy-handed and contradictory motifs such as the highly militaristic yet
zombie-esque 'army' to propagate &quot;mayhem&quot;; by so glibly setting up what
ultimately turns out to be a literal interpretation of multiple personality
disorder (I suppose juxtaposing incongruous elements was the means).<br /><br />Too much visuals technology, probably too much budget and attention on the
bottom line, not enough attention on structure and content, while pretending
to be an ideas film, makes this an insulting and perhaps even, a dangerous
movie. I wouldn't want to be working in a building who principal tenant is a
credit card company for the next while.
