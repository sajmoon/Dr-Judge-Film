To be honest, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to sum up the greatness that
is Fight Club in one paragraph, but I shall give it a try. The film
consists of a psychological and beautifully twisted plot, which
captures your attention from the very first line. The characters are
portrayed remarkably, and the main actors gave brilliant performances.
The movie is quite difficult to grasp at first glance and you may need
to watch it a few times to fully understand. However, this may just be
my judgement. The film gives a different and more complex outlook on
life, and how even the average human being can be haunted and
controlled by the obscurity that is our mind. Your life won&#x27;t be
complete until you have watched Fight Club; it is one of those few
films that will stay with you for the rest of your life.
