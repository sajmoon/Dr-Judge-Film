Visceral. Powerful. Kinetic. Compelling. These are a few of the adjectives
one could use to describe David Fincher's Fight Club, arguably one of the
best films of the year 1999.
Fincher's theatrical adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel is a an
absurd and satirical thriller that never ceases to amaze me due to its
superb plot, acting, and direction. Edward Norton, the narrator is a
pessimist, a fed-up modern day adult who trudges through his mundane
existence deprived of an outlet to express his feelings, which results in
his insomnia. To assuage his disorder, be begins to attend support groups
for victims of cancer that provides him with an emotional release that
allows him to sleep until he confronts another faker, Marla Singer (Helena
Boham-Carter), an even greater cynic than he. While on a business trip, he
meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap manufacturer and salesman, whose
outlook on life inspires him. They form a fight club, where men can
disperse
their rage by viciously pummeling eachother.
Doesn't seem too much or appealing to the average viewer, right?
Wrong.
Fight Club has far more to offer than that plot synopsis, which really
doesn't do it justice. I won't elaborate any further upon this. I wouldn't
want to spoil it for you. Fight Club boasts five impressive performances,
especially from the three leads: Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter as well
as
two supporting actors, singer-turned-actor Meat Loaf and Jared Leto.
Fincher's direction is characteristically flashy without being
overbearing,
as displayed in his other efforts such as Alien 3, Seven, and Panic Room.
One especially memorable sequence was when he depicts the furniture in
Norton's apartment as magazine clipouts, including dotted-line frames and
captions. There is so much more I could compliment this movie upon, but it
is so outstanding, I recommend you stop reading this and see this movie.
