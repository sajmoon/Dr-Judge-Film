1999_November 15 

I remember what I feel seeing Seven. Once again, Fincher touches us with a
delightful insane movie. Protagonists have their own moral codes ! One can
not agree, but we can feel and understand their distress. I think it's not
a
Fascism/Nationalism apology, it's a warning. And it touches you, because
none
of the characters are really disgusting and insane. It could be you with
the
suitable meeting ! Once again, Fincher proves is masterliness to handle
the
camera. There is a rhythm, a tone, that fits to nobody else. And for the
depressive ones, it is much funnier than Seven !
