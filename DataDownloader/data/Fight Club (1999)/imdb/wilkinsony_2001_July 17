What an amazing look at the twists and turns of a tortured mind.  How can
not all of us, struggling through the life, understand the impetus for the
actions of Jack and Tyler.  The film grabs you and does not let go - will
not let go - you don't want it to let go.  Superb acting, script,
storyline
and in terms of my favourite aspect of film - ending!
