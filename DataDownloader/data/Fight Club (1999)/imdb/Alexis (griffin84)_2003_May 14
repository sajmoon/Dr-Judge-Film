This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt &amp;
Edward Norton pull out all the stops as two men who start up fight clubs as
a new form of therapy.  <br /><br />I would normally talk about the plot here, but it's so hard to find where to
begin.  The story takes so many twists and turns that the usual person would
be completely lost, but they're not.  In a way, this is one of those movies
that makes even the most incompetent human being feel smart... which is
good.  <br /><br />I used to get into fights with my family about this movie; my Mom was
outraged by the amount of violence and vandalism, and all I replied was,
&quot;Hey, you went to therapy, it takes different strokes to quit being so
screwed up.&quot;  Of course, I took martial arts and knew about the healing
power of fighting and how it always released my stress.  Apparently, Mom
didn't get it.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is awesome: the script, the characters, the
acting, the special effects (the opening credits and scene showing how the
Narrator's apartment was destroyed were so cool), everything.  Unless you're
against violence in any way, shape, or form, I highly recommend this
movie.
