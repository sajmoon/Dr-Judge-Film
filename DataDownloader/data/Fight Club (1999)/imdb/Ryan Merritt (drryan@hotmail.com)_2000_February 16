Unbelievable, thought provoking, exciting, gripping, and unconventional-
much better than I had even expected. This is a movie that truly makes you
think, definitely a rarity in cinema these days. This is also one that
you'll probably have to watch again, although you will be blown away by the
initial viewing. The lack of Oscar recognition, both for best picture and
Edward Norton's brilliant performance, is a shame.
