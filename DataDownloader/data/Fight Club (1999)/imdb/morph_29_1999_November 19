Those who expect to see an ultra-violent action thriller will be utterly
disappointed. Don't get me wrong, Fight Club is violent but not that much,
it has some action and suspense but deep down it is an amazing black
comedy.
Edward Norton is brilliant and his performance is even better than that of
American History X. Brad Pitt is equally impressive proving that he is not
just a pin up boy and Helena Bohnam Carter is a great surprise in a role
few
people could imagine her performing. All in all Fight club is the best film
for the end of the millennium, that only requires an intelligent and
unbiased audience. Even if it doesn't become a great box-office success, it
is destined to be a generation classic. And that's enough......
