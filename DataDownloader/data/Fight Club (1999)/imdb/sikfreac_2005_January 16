This film is absolutely fantastic. Really, anybody who watches it and
understands what is going on will be able to appreciate it. Despite the
ugly truth behind the personality of the collective subject, you can
actually walk away from this film feeling a certain level of
rejuvenation. It is interesting how well Palahniuk's secrets are kept
and how shocking the revelations are. It is amazing how dimensional the
film is and how much more is revealed each time it is viewed.
Definitely a powerful addition to any home movie library; one never to
collect dust! The cast was well planned; as was the set, musical
soundtrack, and the cinematography will shock you almost as much as the
story itself.
