I wish to contribute a comment that may explain to the movie's detractors
what they may be missing.<br /><br />After watching the movie several times, reading the book, and hearing the
commentary by the director and stars, it seems the best way to explain the
movie is to say it is a riddle.  It does not have a clear message or
resolution and one should come away from it puzzled.  One of my friends (the
only person I know who didn't like it) called it nihilistic.  This is
certainly not true.  Jack goes through stages of nihilism in which he
embraces Tyler's nihilism to varying degrees.  This is a Buddhist story in
which the student must reject the earthly entrapments to achieve
enlightenment.  His teacher tells him he must reject his job, his IKEA
stuff, even his own body to free his soul, but ultimately he must reject his
own teacher so that he may lead himself.  The movie is about the journey
through that process and those looking for a destination or answers are to
be disappointed.  The movie shows us many things that we would like to do
but don't because we choose to behave.  But the movie also shows us that
there are consequences for our actions and we must take responsibilty.
Regarding criticisms that the movie promotes violence, anti-social behavior,
fascism, etc, it was made clear, usually through humor, that that behavior
was wrong.  Perhaps if the movie had been clearly marked as a comedy (it is
not an action movie) more people would have gotten it.<br /><br />There is also an enormous amount of gorgeous detail that went into the
production and even those who don't &quot;get it&quot; should at least be able to
enjoy it that level.<br /><br />And it IS a Gen-X movie.  If you are not Gen-x you will never enjoy it as
much as we do.
