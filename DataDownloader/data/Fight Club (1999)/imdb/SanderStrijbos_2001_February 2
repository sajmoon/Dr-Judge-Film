When I rented Fight Club I thought I was gonna see another Brad Pitt
flick,
but what I was renting was just the best film of 1999! (Magnolia is a
close
second).<br /><br />It's violent, it's funny, it's brilliant! And the twist in the hotelroom
is
just perfect! All the clues are there, but I (and I think no other soul on
this planet) could predict this twist. This twist is in my top 3, together
with the Usual Suspects and the Sixth Sense, but I haven't decided yet
which
one is 1, 2 or 3.<br /><br />Back to Fight Club.<br /><br />It's visual style is incredible and it shows right in the beginning during
the opening credits. The dialogues are even better and this film confirms
something I suspected since Se7en: David Fincher is one of the best
directors at this moment! (Maybe *the* best!!!)<br /><br />The acting is terrific! Pitt is very good, but he's nothing compared with
Norton, who gives (just another?) brilliant performance (after American
History X). Is it in his blood to act... no, to *be* his characters so
perfect?<br /><br />Fight Club proves there can be controversial films within the
Hollywoodstudios. It defines a decade (the 1990's) and it's certainly one
of
my all time favourites.<br /><br />I rate this film a 10 out of 10.
