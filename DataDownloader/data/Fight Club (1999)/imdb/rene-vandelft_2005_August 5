Noticing how this movie comes up many times in discussions I have with
friends, I feel I have to express my admiration. There's really so many
things that's good here: plot, humor, acting, style, cast, camera,
speed. Too much to be told in a small review... So I'll zoom in on some
personal highlights. <br /><br />One amazing thing is that the movie is so rich: it contains so many
interesting scenes and ideas. Another is the combination of a both dark
and very funny atmosphere. A last 'detail' that is quite subjective: I
love the way the alternative scene is portrayed. (The Pixies' best
number is used on the best moment.) The criticism on society is no
preaching here, but more like a nostalgic monument. <br /><br />This movie made David Fincher one of my favorite directors.
