Fight club is,for me,the greatest movie of David Fincher.The acting is
great,especially Brad Pitt,the visuals are cool and the make-up awesome
and
the story is great with a high octane ending.
After the fantastic Se7en and the less good The Game,Fincher proves once
again that he is one on the best director Hollywood has got.Within a
couple
of years,he has offered highly stylised entertainment,but it seems that
he
is not getting the respect he is due.It must not be forgotten that 27
scenes
were cut from his very personnal version of Alien,and that he was just
recently kicked from the MI-3 project by Tom Cruise.
Is he comdemned,like Tim Burton,to follow the studio's rules by directing
movies like Panic Room?I hope that he is going to bring more movies that
will prove to everybody that he is one of the best.But for now,Fight Club
remains THE ultimate reference of his filmography.
*****/5
