Fight club is, in my opinion, the best movie to have come out in last
15 years.. don't believe me, then ask yourself this- when was the last
time that you saw a work of art so driven and so confronting.. or, when
did a movie actually talk about issues you and i have encountered in
our lives with such brutal honesty..<br /><br />It is not just another movie, it is an inevtability of a generation
brought up on TV. It is a prophetic warning of sorts.. it is screaming
in your face - wake up and take a look around you. Coz if you are not
disturbed, then you are just not paying attention! Even if you don't
understand it, that doesn't change the fact that Fight Club deals with
the horrors of our generation, and to cringe away is nothing but a
great denial!
