The reason I absolutely love this movie is because I understood everything
the first time. I was totally amazed with this movie. The plot itself was
so
intriguing, I found myself completely forgetting I had just spent $4.00 on
my popcorn. This movie was directed by David Fincher, by far, the
undisputed
champion of film directing, in my books (other works by him: Seven, The
Game, both of which are absolutely brilliant pieces of
work)<br /><br />This movie's incredible amount of compression was what really made me love
it. It seems as you watch it, that you are being tossed head first into an
immense amount of information, flying past you at a thousand miles per
hour.
And still this movie has a way of making sure you don't miss any of it.
The
stunning use cinematography completely envelops you. I had the most
incredible urge to find David Fincher and ask him how he does this. I just
hope that in my future careers in film, I can be as talented and original
as
him.<br /><br />The cast contains not only an incredibly gifted and talented actor, Edward
Norton, but a fantastic performance by Brad Pitt. I truly feel that Brad
Pitt is a very underrated actor, who deserves much more then the biased
ratings he gets from other critics. If you don't believe me, Seven is, I
believe, his best performance in film ever, and that is NOT an insult.
After
seeing this movie, Edward Norton continues to be one of my favorite actors
(among Kevin Spacy and Jack Nicolson).<br /><br />Of course, I can see why others may not like this movie. It is very
violent, which has never stopped me from enjoying any movie. Furthermore,
it
is very thought provoking, which usually scares away most simple people,
but
keeps me nailed to the seat.<br /><br />As my conclusion, I cannot say anything bad about this movie. It is most
definitely the best movie I have ever seen.
