The Good: The comedy, Drama, Psychology, Philosophy, Acting, stellar
direction, great characters, gritty violence <br /><br />The Bad: Graphic....wait, is that a bad thing?? <br /><br />Bottom Line: Men will love this film. See it. If you aren&#x27;t overly
sensitive or feminine.<br /><br />This film is one that will leave a permanent impression. Its part
anarchist comedy, intellectual thought-piece, Gritty boxing film,
psychological character study, social commentary, and romance.<br /><br />This films first draw is just how well-directed it is. The shots are
just beautiful, showing the world in all its gritty detail and having
no qualms about breaking the fourth wall.<br /><br />I am not going to talk about the plot in detail, mainly because it
contains so much detail and depth that i would just be doing a
disservice. Suffice it to say this is by far the most creative concept
I have seen since A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />I really cannot endorse this film enough..... If you are a guy this is
a must see. If you are a woman, see this, and you may grasp some
insight into the male psyche. Prepare to be offended, though
