Fight Club is by far the best thing David Fincher has done... and also one
of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />Deliberately subversive, Fight Club is really about suckerpunching its
audience, violating taboo after taboo in a way that is at once friendly and
menacing.  Subliminal images flicker in and out, the characters chat with
the audience and the film only rarely flinches.<br /><br />Better yet, it lingers on the plight of men.  While it overdramatizes the
male condition at times, it is at least willing to concede that all is not
well in the land of testosterone... something few people are willing to
either say or accept.  Its best moments are when it shows what the military
(once the proving ground of men) has become... reducing soldiers to nameless
programmable drones - &quot;The first rule of Project Mayhem is that you do not
ask questions, sir.&quot;  And when it talks about men, for all its playfulness,
hipness and pop psychology, it is dead on more often than its
wrong.<br /><br />For all that, it still bows to one convention of Hollywood film - the
violence, while containing a fair amount of blood, isn't in the least
realistic. (long term consequences are absent)  The grue in this film comes
more from the violation of cherished taboos, the same way a good Clive
Barker story does.<br /><br />Anyhow, check it out and make sure you do it on the big screen - you'll
never notice everything without that assistance!
