1999_November 28 

Nothing new. All was said on the subject by the 19th century Socialists
and
Anarchists in Europe. From Alphaville to Natural Born Killers the ideas of
Fight Club have all been already treated in the cinema.<br /><br />This marketing movie seems paradoxically to be another Hollywood money
machine trying to persuade its viewers that money, property and
consumption
are the shackles of one's freedom....<br /><br />I found it quite unconvincing to see a modern Anarchist (supposedly
detached
from worldly possessions) changing so frequently his fashionable clothes
and
showing his hips... unless of course the film has first and foremost the
ambition to attract a numerous public of body conscious youngsters.<br /><br />
