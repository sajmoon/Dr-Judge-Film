The writers and director of this film definitely express a distinct genius
for film making. The story line is consistent, as are the characters.  The
suspension of disbelief is carried right up to the brink of climax. This
story has a unique perspective, if not a factual one when it comes to
insomnia, as I know from experience. Staying awake for days at a time is
exactly what this movie brings to life.  Ed Norton is the consummate geek
looking for that ultimate professional yuppie rush, and having met Brad
Pitt, he is playing himself with an exciting twist.  Overlooking the
Studio's required violence, some of which is necessary to make the film
work, this is a great flick.
