Fight Club is a cool movie about -as its name says- Fight
Club!
It has loads of nice fighting sequences and the plot is
incredible!
The Fight Club really &quot;suck you in&quot; and wont let you go until you&acute;ve seen
it
and after you&acute;ve seen it, you want to see it again. YEAH! Its not just a
movie, its also beautiful art of fighting and secrets of human
mind!
