It's hard to give anyone the title of genuis but Fincher deserves it
without
a doubt. After a poor start out on the blockbuster scale (see Alien3) he's
finally got it right.
I'm not going to say Fight Club is better than se7en, it isn't, but it's
just as good in keeping you routed to the spot til the very end. The
opening
scene does what every movie should do, it's quick, complex and get's you to
beg for more. Simple isn't it Hollywood?!
The ending was a little way out but everyone in their lifetime loves a
freaked out movie. Fight Club is just that.
It is a film not to be taken serously but one rather to enjoy the
controvertial aspects that reflects our society today.
We are all freaks and I'm sure we all want to beat the crap out of the
people next to us and still be able to laugh with them about it. Come on I
know you do.
Just don't pick me.
