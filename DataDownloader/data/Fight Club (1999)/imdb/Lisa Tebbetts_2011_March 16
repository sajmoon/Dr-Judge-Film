Fight Club shows that everyday life can be quite monotonous, but it is
possible to exert your energy elsewhere when you are outside of the
work place. The main actors and actress in Fight Club are Brad Pitt
(Tyler Durden), Edward Norton (The Narrator) and Helena Bonham Carter
(Marla Singer). Each of these individuals did an excellent job when it
comes to reeling in their viewers. Throughout the movie a viewer&#x27;s
suspense level will increase due to the fact that they are unsure as to
what Tyler will do next.<br /><br />The title of the movie represents the exact meaning of the film because
Tyler creates a club of men that can fight against each other in order
to exert their aggressions, which were brought on from a long day in
the office. The club quickly catches on and explodes into every major
city throughout the United States. This film shows how quickly anger
can build up in a human being when they are stuck doing the same thing
every single day of their lives.<br /><br />Another movie that most of you may be familiar with is Office Space,
which is about a group of men that make a pact to change their everyday
routine at work. The group of men scheme up a plan to plant a virus on
their employer&#x27;s computer system. While Fight Club is more violent than
Office Space, they are both revolved around men that want some
excitement in their lives. <br /><br />The lighting in Fight Club is mostly dark due to the fact that fight
clubs are done behind closed doors for fear that they will be shut down
if they are caught by the police. The lighting also helps in
understanding how depressed an individual can become if there is no
excitement or suspense in their lives. The variety of characters help
to piece this film together for each of them complements each other
quite well because they are completely different, but at the same time
they have very similar characteristics.<br /><br />There are times when I feel as if my days run together because they are
so repetitive. Finding new ways to change the repetitiveness can be
difficult, but it is important to figure out what can be done in order
to make everyday different. With this said, things can be changed by
starting out with the opposite foot in which you take off walking with,
carrying things in the other arm and driving a different way to and
from work every day.
