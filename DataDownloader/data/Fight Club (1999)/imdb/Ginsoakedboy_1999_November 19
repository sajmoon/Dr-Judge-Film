Fight Club is an instant classic. It's a classic because it's the best
film
of all concerned, is the antidote to every sentimental schmaltzfest ever
made, poses a really provocative question, and has a classic gag about
children's films being 'tampered' with. I've occasionally wondered whether
that actually happens... Although the last third isn't quite as good, the
first two thirds are the best example of sheer energy in filmmaking since
'A
Clockwork Orange'. And Meatloaf is very, very funny. Go and see this film.
Now.
