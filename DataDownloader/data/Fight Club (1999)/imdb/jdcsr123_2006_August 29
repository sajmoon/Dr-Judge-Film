I liked this movie so much I rented it and showed it to several people,
something I never did before. It brought out my id we all hide away.
Norton fit the part to a T. Meat Loaf needs to get some more credit as
he was the balance that kept us from going insane. The movie is so
twisted. It takes actually several times to see all the parts clearly
unless you&#39;re some kind of eagle eye. The sex was invasive, violent and
disturbing. Pitt is sometimes a little too deadpan, not a lot of
expression. For me this was a real comedy, I was literally rolling on
the floor laughing in the &#39;office&#39;. The fantasy was dreamlike. That old
house was a real antique, I kept wanting to go in there and restore it.
The finale was definitely surprising.
