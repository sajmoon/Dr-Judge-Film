The writing is brilliant, the voice of the &quot;Narrator&quot; is honest and the
acting is just right. Norton and Pitt make such a great team, I wonder
when they are going to make their next movie. <br /><br />And the comments about consumerist society ring very true, even though
we probably won't admit it to ourselves because it's a shell of comfort
that even we ourselves are not ready to shed.<br /><br />The plot isn't too heavy, and the reveal at the end progresses
perfectly. I'd take a twist ending like this one and &quot;The Usual
Suspects&quot; over the twist in the next M. Night Shyamalan thriller any
day.
