I have rated this film with 10 because I consider it the 1st movies of
the 21st Century! It is one of the few movies that has been shot on
32mm new reel film which is the filming method of the 21st century has
state of the art visual effects and everything about this movie, every
aspect that it deals with is modern is of the 21st century.<br /><br />You are not your job or how much money you have in the bank... You are
of the same organic matter as everything else. You are not a unique
snowflake. You are the all singing all dancing crap of the world.<br /><br />Now feel the energy ball around you. Remember to breath. You are
walking slowly into your cave...Walk right into your cave and you are
gonna find your power animal...
