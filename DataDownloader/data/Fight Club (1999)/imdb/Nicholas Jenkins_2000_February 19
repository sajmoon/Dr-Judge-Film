I haven't seen another film all year that rivaled Fight Club in it's
acting,
directing, and story telling.  This is saying a lot considering I'm a huge
Star Wars fan and this was the same year EP1 hit.  It is sad to say though
that Fincher's talents have been ignored by critics (or just
misunderstood) and the film is fading away.  It didn't do very well at the
box office and received mixed emotions from critics and audiences.  Too
bad,
Fincher really strutted his directing stuff in the film and will probably
get only the admiration of us growing film students and makers.  Kudos to
you David.
