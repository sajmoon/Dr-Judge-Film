Fight Club captures a great filmmaker at his best.  David Fincher is a
genius behind the camera, but it's not just the unique directing in this
movie that makes it so good.  A rare combination of great acting,
directing
and writing all play a part in the brilliance of this film.  This is a
great
psychological thriller about a man with deep seeded emotional problems who
is living in an ersatz world that he subliminally despises.  The climax
comes in the classic Poe style surprise ending which only adds to the
thrill
of this unpredictable plot.  If you like suspense, drama, or David
Fincher,
this is the movie to see.  I absolutely loved it.
