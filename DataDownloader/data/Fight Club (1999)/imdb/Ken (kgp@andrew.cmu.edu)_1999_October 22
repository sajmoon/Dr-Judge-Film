1999_October 22 

This is one of the most incredible films I've seen this year.  I encourage
everyone to see it.  Now I know that the violence is a large part of this
movie, that's why David Fincher decided to leave it in unedited.  This will
obviously aggravate those people that search for direct correlations
between
violence on the screen and violence in their backyards.  The truth is that
the gore and physicality of this film is essential to its themes.  So its
excellent to see a director come forward with something so amazing without
watering it down in the aftermath of unrelated and unfortunate tragedies.
America should learn to stop looking for only one reason for the terrible
things that have happened recently and instead look at how our culture
functions as a whole.  It is ridiculous to blame one aspect of society.
Fight Club shows a disillusionment with this society, something that should
be expressed without being implicated in a series of tangential
tragedies
