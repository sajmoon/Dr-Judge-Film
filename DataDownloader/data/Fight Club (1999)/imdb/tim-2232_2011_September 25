*** ENTERTAINING - STRONG POLITICAL BIAS *** <br /><br />Firstly, let me start by saying that this movie is entertaining and
interesting, no matter how you define your political ideology.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie is about socialist anarchism. It depicts a guy who
hates his job, considers it slavery, who gets fed up with consumerism
and capitalism, and starts destroying private property with his secret
syndicate of anarchist-socialist buddies.<br /><br />Of course, it&#x27;s no surprise avowed liberals like Brad Pitt and Edward
Norton would take on the roles for this film. It suits their political
biases.<br /><br />Would I recommend watching it? Yes. Go check it out. Is it an insult to
my intelligence too? Yes, it is.
