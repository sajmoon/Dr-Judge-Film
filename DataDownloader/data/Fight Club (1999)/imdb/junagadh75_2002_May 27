&quot;Fight Club&quot; is about a yuppie who, dissatisfied with his hollow life, turns
first to support groups which he doesn't need to fill his emptiness, and
then by chance becomes involved with a marginal character played by Brad
Pitt;  together they start a &quot;Fight Club&quot; in which lonely, empty men like
themselves get together and pound each other just for the sensation. 
Eventually the &quot;Fight Club&quot; takes over the nation.
I know alot of people whose opinions I otherwise respect who think this is a
really good, intellectually challenging movie - I thought it was nothing
special.  The basic concept and its development never struck me as anything
other than smarmy and obvious and the humor as merely cutesy (in fact, the
plot seemed like a slightly-raunchier-than-average sitcom premise extended
to feature-length).  The MTV-style direction was ... MTV-style direction,
that's all.  The only thing that it really had going for it was that Brad
Pitt, whom I knew only as a People Magazine pretty boy, proves that he can
actually act - but that trivial fact doesn't make for an entire movie.  If
you really want to see a decent satire on contemporary America, check out
&quot;Andy Warhol's Bad&quot;, and forget this lame attempt at meaning by filmmakers
whose talents are better suited for mass-produced Cineplex
product.
