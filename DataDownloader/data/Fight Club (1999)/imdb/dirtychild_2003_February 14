Fight Club tells the story of an insomniac insurance investigator (Ed
Norton) who initially attends help/support groups to try to help his
insomnia.  Annoyed at the presence of another `faker' (Marla &#150; Helena Bonham
Carter) at these groups &#150; he turns to Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt) &#150; an
eccentric soap salesman.  They soon develop underground `fight clubs' &#150; a
highly aggressive male `support' group.  Fight Club starts to get out of
hand when Tyler gears `Project Mayhem' up a notch.<br /><br />The plot of Fight Club is based on a Chuck Palahnuk novel of the same name
(brilliant author &#150; check him out!).  The narrator (Norton) provides classic
nihilistic / disinfected / insomniac views of the mundane of life (so many
classic lines).<br /><br />The performances are just so good &#150; Brad Pitt is always a winner in these
`sorts' of crazy roles (see 12 Monkeys).  Ed Norton plays a terrific
`straight' worker type who is enticed by Tyler's ways and `free' lifestyle &#150;
but as he works out Tyler's world &#150; Ed Norton is great as the seemingly
insane narrator.<br /><br />The soundtrack (by the Dust Brothers) complements the mind-blowing visuals
from David Fincher and crew.<br /><br />This is one movie that is a bit of a mind-fudge the first time around &#150; and
a bit of a must for repeat viewing!<br /><br />10 out of 10!!!
