Wow. This movie blows my mind, it is so good that i cant stand it. This
is
the best movie that i have ever seen. I look down on people that didnt
like
this movie, because to me, if you didnt like this  movie, then you are
emotionally dead and extremely shallow. Or just plain not understood the
movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norten are two of the best actors in movies
today.   I cant believe this movie was so overlooked at the Oscars.
