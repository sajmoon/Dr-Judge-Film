when a movie has everything- when it is smart and mysterious, funny and
serious, dramatic and moving, when it also has alot to say about the life
of
each viewer, when it is deep, and when it burns itself in the memory
forever- only then can it be called perfect.
This was the first time I have seen a movie so complete, that all I thought
on the way out was &quot;I want to see it again and again&quot;. But no matter how
many time I'll see it, I will always rememebr the first
time.
This is the best movie I have ever seen, without any competition.
