Due to the title, I figured this would be a run-of-the-mill &quot;top of the
heap&quot; brutal piece of garbage designed to show off Brad Pitts' pecs. I never
would have bothered with it if I hadn't found out that Helena Carter was in
it and via a slight crush on her, I rented the thing.
What a great move on my part since this is easily one of the best and
blackest comedies I have had the honor of viewing in some time. The movie is
filled with some of the oddest (other dimensional) characters I've run into
since my junkie surge on P.K.Dick books. The &quot;Fight Club&quot; of the title is
there and is brutal (W/ make-up by Rob Bottins - good to see his work again)
but does not dominate the movie but rather is axiomatic to the Philosophy of
the Brad Pitt character as well as the existential
confusion/emptiness of the characters surrounding him.<br /><br />There's no reason to go any further other than to say that this is a &quot;Must
see&quot; for those of you that liked &quot;Cemetary Man&quot; and &quot;Freds Dead Mom&quot; and
other works in the same vein.<br /><br />
