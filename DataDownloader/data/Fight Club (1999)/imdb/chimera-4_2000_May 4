I really wanted to see this film at the flicks but never got round to it.
Having rented it on video I have to say I enjoyed it immensley BUT this
movie is NOT the movie you think it is at all. All the trailers and articles
you may have read make Fight Club out to be a testosterone fuelled macho
fight movie with a few philosophical notions chucked in for good measure.
While these elements are there, Fight Club is more a psychological thriller,
an insight into the psyche of one man who on the outside is just as
conforming as most of the rest of us but inside longs to express his chaotic
primal instincts in a definitive and liberating manner.<br /><br />The twist towards the end took me totally by surprise but it also made a few
scenes early on in the film make a bit more sense and overall gave the film
a more powerful edge. David Fincher is fast showing himself to be a talented
and very capable director with such films as Se7en and The Game to his name.
His artistic and gritty direction also almost made Alien 3 good
too.<br /><br />Acting is fine all round and Meat Loaf (in the first acting role I've seen
him in (Spice Girls movie doesn't count)) proves to be a pretty good actor
too. There are quite a few funny moments too although I'm sure some of the
things I found funny weren't meant to be (the liposuction raid (ok maybe it
was meant to be then)) and other people probably didn't find that amusing
but thats my problem.<br /><br />All round a film worth seeing but don't be fooled by the advertising and
hype. Thats not the movie you're getting at all.
