&quot;Fight Club&quot; is very much like a lot of art. You either love it or hate
it. This movie does not eschew difficult topics or hesitate to delve
into some pretty serious content about society and its inner workings,
all the while delivering one of the most memorable movie-going
experiences I have had thus far in my life. Yes, Fight Club is that
good.<br /><br />In an age where studios seem to be afraid to create, market, and
distribute challenging films, relying more and more on material
originating not from the creative process but from the sterile and
puerile environs of a focus group, Fight Club stands as the rarest of
treats. Here is a film that has the gumption to ask the fundamental
question: What is life in a postmodern society all about and is it
worth living the way it is currently constructed, or is a change in
order? Many have cited the recent releases of films such as &quot;Crash&quot; and
&quot;Syriana&quot; as evidence of Hollywood getting back to producing material
which serves to challenge the status quo and discuss some important
issues. I would beg to differ. It was quite clear to me, after watching
both films, that what Hollywood was doing was playing it safe. It
released films that reflected its own left-leaning politics, knowing
full well that they will be heartily embraced by the media as
reflections of their own well-entrenched values. Then, it surmised, it
could look around and say to anyone who would listen that they are
making important and politically relevant statement, when in fact all
they are engaged in is preaching to the converted. Not very daring at
all.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; transcends pat classifications and easy categorizations
and attempts to appeal to all audiences. That it does not succeed in
doing so should not in any way diminish the enormous achievement the
filmmakers were able to realize. Whether you like the underlying
message of the film or not is not important. What is important is that
somebody had the nerve to ask tough questions and propose their own
theories and answers to them. Now, that, is quite rare courage indeed.<br /><br />Notice that I did not give you many details about the movie. This is
because &quot;Fight Club&quot;, like many movies, needs to be experienced from
the vantage point of having an open and curious mind and a hunger for
world-class film-making. That, &quot;Fight Club&quot; has in abundance. Enjoy!
