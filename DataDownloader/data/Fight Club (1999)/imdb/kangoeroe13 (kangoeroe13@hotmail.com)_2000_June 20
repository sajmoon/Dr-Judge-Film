Why ,for God's sake,was this movie totally neglected at the Oscars? Was is
too smart? Was the story too controversial?
Was it because the movie made you THINK?
In my opinion it should have won the Oscar for Best Movie,Best Male
Lead(Norton was brilliant!),Best Female Lead,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best
Score,and every Oscars for the visuals that can be won!
This movie made a great impression on me and it really make me think and
consider some things in life.
Fincher and Norton are the most promising director and actor of the 21st
century:they will win several prizes in the future.
But Pitt,Carter and even Meat Loaf were good too ,though.
The visuals are,to say it in one word:PERFECT!
The soundtrack is also a pure piece of beauty:it's the coolest I've ever
heard!
Nothing else but good stuff about this movie!
MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS,PLEASE!
