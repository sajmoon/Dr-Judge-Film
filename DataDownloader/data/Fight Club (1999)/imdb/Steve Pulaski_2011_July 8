Fight Club&#x27;s tagline is probably one of my favorites and boasts a great
question in the world today; &#x22;how much can you know about yourself if
you&#x27;ve never been in a fight?&#x22; Never being in a &#x22;true&#x22; fight, I suppose
I, myself, and a lot of others don&#x27;t know their physical strength,
their limitations, and abilities under the given circumstances in a
real scuffle. When will you call &#x22;uncle?&#x22; When will the anger consume
you? When will you bleed out? Let&#x27;s not talk about it.<br /><br />Being requested by many people to watch this film, why I put it off is
something I can&#x27;t answer. I believe it was because I feared since the
film is filled with morals and very subtle messages I would not &#x22;get&#x22;
most of it. Out of the countless number of morals Fight Club spat at
me, I took two and would like to share them.<br /><br />The number one thing I took out of Fight Club is that men have become
sort of &#x22;softies&#x22; in the world we live in, and many no longer sport the
&#x22;tough as nails&#x22; image women mistake us for. Here we have an insomniac
who loses direction in life, becomes what some will call &#x22;insane,&#x22; and
escapes to an underground fighting club where men beat the living hell
out of each other for absolutely no reason, no questions asked. I think
it&#x27;s because beating each other to a pulp makes them feel like they
still sport this image, and that they haven&#x27;t gotten soft. They can
take a lot of damage, unnecessary and necessary.<br /><br />The other thing is sometimes the worst enemy can be your best friend or
yourself. Writing a spoiler free review of this film is difficult, and
explaining this moral without stating an example is hard as well. I
really don&#x27;t want to give anything away just to explain the moral I
picked up, so I won&#x27;t. Just go into the movie with that in the back of
your mind.<br /><br />On with the plot, our main character, also the narrator, is played by
Edward Norton. He remains nameless throughout the entire film, and
works as an automobile company employee. He suffers from serve
insomnia, often having trouble dictating what is real and what is fake.
Director David Fincher describes his character as an &#x22;everyman.&#x22; To
cope with his insomnia, and forbidden any sort of treatment from his
doctor, the man continues to visit support groups. He does this to feel
better about himself, and to witness others with more serve problems.
He is an impostor at every one of these groups, and creates a fake name
for each.<br /><br />Another impostor attends these groups named Marla Singer (Bonham
Carter) much to the dismay of our narrator. They talk to each other and
work out a deal so that their presences at these groups don&#x27;t coincide
with one another.<br /><br />On a flight home from a meeting, the narrator meets Tyler Durden
(Pitt), a soap salesman. They talk at a bar after the narrator returns
home to find his apartment in flames, and Tyler forces the narrator to
punch him. They continue to fight in the back of this bar, with more
people arriving everyday. They soon find a basement in a building they
can use and establish their own &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; to get away from society&#x27;s
troubles.<br /><br />Fight Club is scored very well, and its cinematography is beautiful.
Why no Oscar nominations for the much deserved Norton and Pitt? Because
of the film&#x27;s extreme marketing. Disappointing in the field of
criticism and revenue, Fight Club&#x27;s trailers looked as if it were a
film about a bunch of people beating the hell out of each other for no
reason besides personal satisfaction. There is a market for those
movies, but I&#x27;m pretty sure unless having read the novel of the same
name by Chuck Palahniuk or reading up on the internet about this movie,
people who went to go see it, were likely, not aware they were seeing a
very smart and beautifully crafted film.<br /><br />Sadly, I was mislead upon watching this movie. So many people,
including friends and reviewers on various movie sites, described the
film as &#x22;life changing&#x22; and many said it changes one&#x27;s view of movies
forever. It did none of that for me. It entertained me, and some
moments I couldn&#x27;t look away. Even at the most grisly times, Fight Club
remains classy and stylistic. But it is no way life changing.<br /><br />But I can totally see how it did for some people. Some people enjoy the
occasional &#x22;mind-rape&#x22; style of filmmaking, a style that Fincher is
very good at. They love making assumptions, hunches, and usually use
large amounts of evidence gained from repeated viewings of some movies.
Even video games like The Legend of Zelda have caused a legion of fans
to take the world of the game very seriously. I don&#x27;t have the time to
do this, especially to this particular film. I can&#x27;t see myself
enjoying it more and more with repeated viewings. It was very enjoyable
the first time around, but I feel the more I watch it the less
surprised I&#x27;ll be at certain events in the film that stunned me (IE:
the scene with Lou).<br /><br />The on character relationship between Norton and Pitt is excellent, and
can&#x27;t be replaced at all. The various morals in the film are very well
crafted and the movie tackles more genres than one may expect. It&#x27;s a
lot like Kubrick&#x27;s A Clockwork Orange. Critics deemed it &#x22;dark&#x22; when it
first came out, but lived on to become a classic. Fight Club took the
same route. I&#x27;m sorry I delayed my viewing of it for so long.<br /><br />Starring: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed
by: David Fincher.
