I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in this film until a friend of mine
started raving about it.  Then it came on TV so I thought I might as well
have a look, but nothing prepared me for what I saw.<br /><br />I was expecting a dumb film about grown men hitting each other a lot.  I was
not expecting such a dark, psychological drama with such intelligence, wit
and an ending to make it all seem worthwhile.<br /><br />I haven't seen a film that has kept me awake at night for some time now, but
this one did that and more.<br /><br />Good acting, direction and all that kind of thing, but most importantly,
what an inspired script.
