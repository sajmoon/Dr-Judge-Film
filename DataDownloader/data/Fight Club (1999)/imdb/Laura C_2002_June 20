Wowsa! David Fincher has a way that can take an audience into a realistic
world but make it so compelling and breathtaking that it is almost unreal.
Fight Club meets all audience expectations and gives them that little bit
more. The cinematography style is possibly the best in modern cinema today
with pans, going through floors. What else could be more
exciting?<br /><br />Without saying too much about the storyline, its genuinely one of the best
that has come out of mainstream cinema for a long, long time. This film has
a definate arty and alternative edge, but aimed at a younger audience, this
is what people want. Something fresh, new and more vibrant than the average
teen flick movie that bursts into the cinemas every week. Brad Pitt is
truly
breathtaking in his role (Tyler) with a very laid back and cool edge to his
character that comes across perfectly with every move made. While Edward
Norton finishes this off with being the 'geek' but with a slight cool and
sophisticated edge. However Marla has to be my favourite character as a
sleezy type of sex object that smokes perfectly, walks perfectly and is a
complete idol for fans of this film.<br /><br />The Dust Brothers have done a fine job and composing an industrial, yet
alternative soundtrack that fits in with every second of this film. The
opening sequence has a particualy amazing piece of music that sets the
whole
dark and twisted edge that this film carries.<br /><br />Fight Club is alive and modern, mixing special effects to create a
compelling and amazing scenario of events that combine into a film that is
basically a reflection on society today.
