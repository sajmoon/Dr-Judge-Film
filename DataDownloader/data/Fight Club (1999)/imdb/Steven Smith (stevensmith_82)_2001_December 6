Being a big fan of the actor-director combination of David Fincher and
Brad
Pitt in Seven, my expectations for Fight Club were very high and I wasn't
disappointed. Add to the Fincher-Pitt combination the talents of Ed Norton
and Helena Bonham Carter and you have a recipe for success.<br /><br />Fight Club is a tremendously dark comic thriller that keeps you guessing
from the moment it starts until the very end. I must admit to being very
confused after seeing it for the first time but, after the second viewing
I
was totally taken by this incredible piece of work. And after seeing it a
few more times since the subtle plot points that aren't noticed the first
few times just become clear the more and more you watch it. I'm sure there
must still be little points that I haven't noticed yet<br /><br />To those who haven't seen it, the title is slightly misleading in that you
may believe it is just a very violent film but don't be fooled, although
there are scenes of violence, the film has so much more to offer than just
fighting.<br /><br />In short another great film from David Fincher
