&#145;Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative,
raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the
actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate imbalance
with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far side of
diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and charismatic. 
Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and parasitic girl
friend.  <br /><br />&#145;Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious elements of societal
dysfunction and wraps them up into a single imaginative well crafted and
entertaining film.  We have elements of gang behavior, cultism, anarchy,
terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the name of iconoclasm.  Exciting,
seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool and hip!<br /><br />So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to everything
that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and technically superb
but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at social satire,
while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't
help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against consumerism as the
theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume your
film.<br /><br />At what point does a film cross the line between art and depravity?  &#145;Fight
Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the question.  If art is a
reflection of a society's culture and values, then when I look at this film
I have to be frightened at what is staring back at me.  When I reflect on
some of the most popular films of the last five years, I can't help but
notice the accelerating celebration of random and impulsive violence,
depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  &#145;Fight Club' has pushed the
envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say nadir) in the
portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal dissolution.<br /><br />It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to attack the
establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  &#145;Fight
Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of such
cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always seems
to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live
`naturally' (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is you
whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those who
extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously promote
and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem are much
less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air conditioned
comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at Columbine High
School.<br /><br />I like dark movies as much or more than the next guy, but this film simply
goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with criticizing the establishment. 
Constructive criticism is the only way to bring about progressive change. 
But this film is merely vulgar cynicism that suggests that mayhem is
preferable to imperfect culture.  That is grossly irresponsible. <br /><br />So I am placed in the paradoxical position of admiring this film while I
must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand in awe of it as a filmmaking
accomplishment.  But as a human being concerned with the greater good of the
species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the
name of entertainment?  Are we so myopic as to demand entertainment at any
cost?  I guess we will see when someone raises the ante and the next shock
treatment comes to a theater near you.
