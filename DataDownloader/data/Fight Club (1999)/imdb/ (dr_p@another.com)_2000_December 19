This film has got to be one of the best films in the 90's, let alone in
1999.
I found it to be a fantastic film which was not afraid to step back and
take a look at real life situations then criticise them. The film is
almost
worth watching just for the 'mindjob' of an ending.
If you can watch this film with an open mind and keep a track of the
storyline then you will definately enjoy it.
