Great!!!A great movie!A Ferocious attack versus the modern and iper-consume
society.A powerful punch in the face of this society, a scream that is
almost a terroristic pamphlet, a pamphlet which invites the human race to
take again our life, and to free ourself from the new slavery based on the
work-consume chains. A very Nietzsche-Movie!!!
