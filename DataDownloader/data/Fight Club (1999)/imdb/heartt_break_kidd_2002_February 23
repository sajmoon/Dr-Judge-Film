Everyone I tell to watch this movie come back with the exact same thing.  I
watched this movie, twice, and all I have to say is WOW.  Brad Pitt did
such
a good job, his skills are unappreciated.  Norton did his usual excellent
preformance.
The only thing that held this movie back was poor advertising, it was made
out to be too much like a underground boxing movie.
