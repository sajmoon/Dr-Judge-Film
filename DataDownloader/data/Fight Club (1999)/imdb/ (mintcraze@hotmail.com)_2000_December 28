This is my favourite movie of all time. It is sheer brilliance in every
single way, from the acting, to the sound editing (should have won the
oscar!!!)... the music was perfect, the lighting was just write, but above
all the script was.... did I say brilliant already? There are no other
words.
What impresses me the most is that aside from being entertaining,
hilarious,
sexy, exciting and surprising (no doubt there!), the movie delivers an
important message about what is really important in life, and about how we
let image and material things control us. The movie is about regaining
what
we as a society lost many years ago- it's about staring over... hitting
rock
bottom and that feeling you get when you have nothing to lose.<br /><br />This movie introduced a whole way of life to me and millions of others,
and
it changed who I am, how I think and the way I live my
life.
As someone in the movie says...
&quot;My eyes are open now.&quot;
Even if your eyes are shut tight, 'Fight Club' will peel them open.
Go!
Go see it right now. =)
