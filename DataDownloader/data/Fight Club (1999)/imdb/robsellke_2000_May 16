&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those truly original movies.  There aren't any
other
movies like it.  Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durdan, a colorful and insane
projectionist/soap-dealer/fighter/waiter with a crazy attitude towards
life.
He urinates in his customers meals, adds pornography into children's
movies, and uses human fat stolen from the liposuction clinic to make his
soap.  Edward Norton plays the narrator, a timid worker with a chronic
sleeping disorder, numerous unnecessary self-help groups, no life, and a
huge collection of Swedish specialty furniture.  They finally meet on an
airplane, when the narrator's coming back from a business trip.  The
narrator's condo blows up from gas and he moves in with Durdan.  Tyler
lives
in an industrial neighborhood in a decrepit sagging wreck.  The two of
them
have a brawl in parking lot and truly enjoy it.  Several guys see them
fighting and join in.  Thus, Fight Club is born.  Every Saturday a group
of
men gets together in the basement of a bar and beat the crud out of each
other.  Durdan and the narrator are co-founders and they come up with
crazy
goals, assignments, rules, and projects for Fight Club.  The club mutates
and things start to get confusing.  The plot then has a major, completely
unexpected twist towards the end that turns the story upside down.  &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is a fascinating conveyance of a story, and it is definitely worth
seeing.
