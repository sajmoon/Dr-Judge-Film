My friend popped in that question to me. If Fight Club would have a
sequel,
how will the story go?<br /><br />But for me, I don't think there is no point in having a sequel. True, the
film is open ended but films like that would have to have an indefinitive
ending so that there is room for imagination for the viewers.<br /><br />What do you think? Is there a room for a sequel?
