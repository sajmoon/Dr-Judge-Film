This is one my top-ten list for greatest films ever! I honestly can&#x27;t
think of a problem with Fight Club. Not from its brilliant premise of a
pessimistic insomniac and a nihilistic punk that create a fight club
for the sake of therapy for white-collared men. Or the Oscar worthy
performances by Edward Norton (American History X), Brad Pitt (Troy),
or Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd). The twist ending is utterly
mind-blowing. My favorite part about this feature, beside its stylized
format and enigmatic screenplay, is the cinematography. No words can
describe the perfect, divine, Godsent cinematography. Jeff Cronenweth
is a master of his craft. I have no other words that I can employ to
describe the greatness of Fight Club.
