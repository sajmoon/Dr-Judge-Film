2003_March 4 

I am a big fan of Michael Jackson and noticed that the video for his single
'Who Is It' was directed by David Fincher so I rented a couple of DVDs by
this same director whose style caught my eye. The first DVD was Seven and it
is a masterpiece which I won't comment on here. The second DVD was Fight
Club and I am not exaggerating when I say I was truly mesmerized by this
film. I found Mr. Fincher's shot selection unique and creative in
practically every scene and I found the story impossible to draw myself away
from. Although I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, I believe Edward
Norton should have got top billing for Fight Club. He is definitely the
anchor of the film and he pulls off his character's insecurities,
affirmation, and paranoia  superbly. This film deserves the plaudits it has
received, 8/10.
