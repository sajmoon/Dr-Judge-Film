This film takes some of the questions of the 90's and the ages namely
&quot;What
is a man?&quot;, &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;Why am I here&quot; and uses the answers to
explain
questions such as &quot;Why do terrorists kill people&quot;. This film shows the
danger of a society in which you are judged by your possessions alone,
and
what happens to people who feel they don't have a voice are organised by
a
charismatic leader. The fight club itself is a clever male bonding device
to
draw in new recruits and toughen them up before the revolution. Great
camera
tricks only add to the plot, Pitt Norton and Carter are great, nice cameo
by
Meatloaf great directing by Fincher.
