I chose that one line summary because, after seeing Fight Club and adding
it
to my personal top ten list, it made me laugh.<br /><br />Why am I laughing at it? Well, because that sentence is right, and
extremely
wrong.<br /><br />After seeing Fight Club, and more importantly understanding it, that
sentence is more or less a stab in the back of what this film is saying.
It's trying to scare away people with the thought that they might be
infected by the films themes and teachings of Tyler Durden by calling it
anti-social behavior. However the teachings of Tyler is something that has
been staring in people's faces and try as you may you can't help but
listen
to him. And I was actually rooting for the revolution. For the person who
hasn't seen it I won't go into that or mutter his teachings here.<br /><br />Instead I'll just drone on about the visual style, the brilliant acting
and
flawless directing.<br /><br />But first the story. Meet Jack (Edward Norton). Jack can't sleep, so from
the advice of his doctor, he goes to testicular cancer
meeting.<br /><br />Here he meets Bob (Meat Loaf). Then, bla bla bla, meets the girl (Helena
Bonham Carter), then finally he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who
manages
to turn his life upside down. And his world keeps spinning right up till
the
twist ending that can be worked out, if you really watch the film.<br /><br />That description of this film is pitiful. I haven't even mentioned the
actual Fight Club, the flashes of porn and the messages of meaningless
work
and individualty being useless.<br /><br />The acting is spot on, Eddie does a great job and this is probably his
second best performance yet. But it's Brad Pitt who steals the show as the
thought provoking Tyler. Once again, when I thought I figured Brad out he
does an amazing film like this. As my friend said, &quot;Man, he knows how to
pick'em!&quot;<br /><br />The visual style of this film is unique to say the least. The extreme
close-up of fridges, trashcans, look amazing. And the techniques like slow
motion, flashbacks and rapid editing are done magificant. The visual style
rivals that of Run Lola Run.<br /><br />The script isn't all that exciting to read, so the director (David
Fincher)
had quite a job to do here. And he did it with style, which is what I like
to see. And with this film he becomes, a great director.<br /><br />So with all that said you should be renting the DVD as you read this. Word
of warning : Don't watch it with director's comentry, he just talks about
the lighting.
