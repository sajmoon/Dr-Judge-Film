brad pitt is a different kind of actor.  he has made good choices (seven,
snatch) and really really bad ones (meet joe black, interview with the
vampire) but fight club was definitely his best choice of all.  his,
helena
bonham carter's and ed norton's performance were not comparable to
anything
else i've ever seen.  it was all just dead-on and too real.<br /><br />everything about this film appealed to me.  the things i read about the
plot.  let's face it this world sucks and some of us are not wanted.  yep,
i
get it.  i went on to read that david fincher would be directing and seven
was awesome.  so again, check.  then i read the book and loved it.  so one
more time, check.  when i finally saw the movie, it was complete.  i
couldn't have been happier with the results and i was glad to see that
screenplay writer jim uhls stuck to the book for the most part.  author
chuck palahniuk is the absolute god of satire and i recommend all of his
other books for you to read, before they become hit films as well.  just
so
you know, survivor is in the works and i don't mean that lame australian
outback crap.  so check out not only fight club the movie, but all of
palahniuk's stories.<br /><br />rating- explosive, anarchy, humor, meat loaf, jared leto (the girls like
him
i hear), etc...what else do you need?  10 out of 10.
