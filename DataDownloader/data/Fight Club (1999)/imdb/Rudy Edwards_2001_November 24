I love to hear people's opinions on Fight Club. Almost no one &quot;Gets It&quot;.
First, there are those who think it's just an excuse for mindless violence
on celluloid, who have failed to look past the flashy violence to the story
that tries so hard to hit you in the face. Then, there are those who love
the movie, but love it for it's violence and the message that, if you aren't
paying attention, seems to be screaming at you from the mouth of Tyler
Durden. <br /><br />In fact, the movie is a fantastic psychological introspective the likes of
which has never been attempted. It's as misunderstood as Kubrick's classic
&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; which goes down in history haunted by the violent fans
who loved it for all the wrong reasons. It's a cult favorite of our own lost
generation without the intellegence to understand it's true nature.<br /><br />If you ask your friends to &quot;Hit me as hard you can....&quot; you've missed the
point of this masterpiece, just as those who wallowed in the idea of
ultraviolence missed Kubrick's point so many years ago.
