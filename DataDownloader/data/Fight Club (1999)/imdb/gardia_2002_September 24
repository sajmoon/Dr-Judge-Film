Brilliant film, hugely underated and misunderstood.  Half of what makes
this
film is what you bring to it, if you go to watch a film and still be
chewing
it over days after you will enjoy this film.  If you are the type of
person
who likes just to absorb a film in the same manner people absorb their
popcorn, go watch the sum of all fears.
