This is an incredible movie. I&#39;ve seen &quot;fight club&quot; when it was
released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, and i&#39;ve discovered an incredible writer too. It&#39;s too
complicated to describe a movie like this. It&#39;s a crude, realistic,
nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with
clich&eacute;s, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act,
how you must live. It&#39;s not only a fighting movie at all. It&#39;s about
deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human
again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both
seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the
movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted
mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can&#39;t tell
anything more &#39;cause i&#39;ll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel
it&#39;s great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost
identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider
&quot;Fight Club&quot; one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the
decade. It&#39;s a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if
you think i must have my head examined, well, you&#39;ve totally missed the
point!!! You wont be disappointed, i can assure you that!!! 10/10
