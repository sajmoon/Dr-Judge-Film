1999_November 16 

I'm merely 16 years old.  That is manly why,according to the critics,this
movie is highly rated by me. This movie is a kick-you-in-the-balls kind of
movie that has a fast pace to it that I've never seen before.  Its
integration of digital effects is noticeable but hard to point out which
adds to the movie.  The dialogue is humorous and smooth, combined with
really good &quot;fight&quot; scenes,no pun intended,which make this movie a teen or
young adult &quot;got to see&quot; film.  My dad tagged along for the movie, and
claimed that it sucked, but that was merely because he went to the bathroom
at the most crucial point. So in closing....GO SEE THIS MOVIE, &quot;It will
stand out in your head for at least week, as you try and wrap your head
around what you saw.&quot;
