1999_November 2 

I went into the Fight Club not knowing that it was made from a book and
with
rather low expectations (I wasn't planning on seeing it) and I thought it
was going to be something random and
bloody about a bunch of guys who got together and beat the crap out of each
other as some sort of perverse ritual of social release and male bonding.
Which it was, except for the fact that that only covered the first 40
minutes or so, at which point it got interesting.  Overall, quite well
done.
I have to say that it's one of the first movies in a fairly decent amount
of time that I've seen which was totally and absolutely unpredictable.  I
would also say that it managed to be probably the single best example of
the
cyberpunk movement that I've ever seen on film, without having even a
single
computer in it (or at least any of any import).  This was most likely
entirely unintentional, but very cool nonetheless.  Definitely worth my
$8.50
