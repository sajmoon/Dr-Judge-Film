I must have been beamed up to a flying saucer at the exact period when
I was watching this movie because it feels now that I'm back on earth
among the human race again, that I have a totally different view of
this film than everyone else. I hated it. It must be me, after reading
so many positive reviews praising this film and how it has had a
profound effect on them, I feel I must see this movie again for a
re-appraisal. What I do remember, before being abducted, was that Fight
Club started out so powerfully, I was amazed at the writing. It came
out swinging. You knew this wasn't going to be a run-of-the-mill
script. Then the story settled into a long drawn out fight after fight
sequence that completely turned me off. Not because of the violence.
Hey, I'm a Rambo film kinda guy, but just the sheer stupidity of it
all. I'm now a bit confused. So many others saw something special in
all this that I'm not ready to rate this movie until I force myself to
sit through another viewing.
