this is the only movie i have ever seen that has actually made me really
think
about it. i have never gotten more out of a movie than i have of fight
club.
tyler
durden is a god. and there is a video coming out based on this classic.
its
influence is so great. the things you own will end up owning you. its
only
after
youve lost everything that your free to do anything. norton does a pretty
good
performace. however brad pitt deserves a oscar. much like american beauty
but
better in my opinion. i own both.
