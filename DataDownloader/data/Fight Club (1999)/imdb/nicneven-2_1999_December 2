1999_December 2 

A lot of people, having no other information than the purposely vague
first
promotional preview, will go see this movie because of the fight scenes.
And
sure enough, they get plenty of them-blood and guts (and teeth) included.
Still, this movie actually has a plot, and it's not another rehash a la
&quot;Bloodsport&quot; or &quot;Best of the best&quot;. People are not punching each other to
death for money or for some misplaced and misguided sense of honor. This
is
not Ultimate Fighting on film.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays one side of a coin. An ordinary Joe who is torn
between
self-pity because of his drab, meaningless existence, and a growing
self-loathing triggered by a feeling of having sold out to &quot;the system&quot;.
Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf provide hilarious performances as
perpetual support group attendees, adding just the right amount of dark
humor for the viewers to let their guard down. Enter Brad Pitt as Tyler
Durden, the face of anti-establishment, the voice of the rage.<br /><br />Tyler Durden is the type of character you follow around with a morbid
fascination, scared of what he might do next but shivering with
anticipation
because you can't wait to see it. He hovers menacingly in our peripheral
vision waiting for the moment when our consciousness will be caught off
guard. And the rest. is something you'll have to see for yourself. Go see
Fight Club. and when you're done mopping up your brains from the floor,
see
it again.
