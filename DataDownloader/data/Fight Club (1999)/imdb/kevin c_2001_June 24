2001_June 24 

I initially saw this film when it had it's cinematic release, but my viewing
was soured by a noisy audience. So I returned to watch it on satellite last
night, and i have to say I do stand by my initial judgment.<br /><br />The first half of this film is one of the best films in the past 10 years.
It's fresh, cool and perfectly captures the male angst as we enter a new
millennium. The second half is more messy in comparison, and so this film
has to go down as an honourable attempt.<br /><br />Fincher has showed excellent promise and originality with his first few
films. Norton is a good actor, and Pitt can be excellent when he wants to
be.
