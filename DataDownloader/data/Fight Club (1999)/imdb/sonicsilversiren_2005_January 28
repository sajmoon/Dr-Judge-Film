I find two elements in this film fascinating--one is its message, of
casting off what society wants if you would be happier with a dirtier,
less marketable life. I'm a firm believer in social alternatives, and
was therefore delighted and fascinated by this film's message. Even
better was the delivery--it wasn't preachy or heavy, but rather a
lighthearted and brutally humorous nod to modern comforts being
something less than comfortable.<br /><br />Even better however, was the entertainment factor. The characters were
fresh and witty, and the dialog and plot were not sacrificed for the
sake of the message. In most cases, even if you didn't grasp or didn't
like the theme you could come away with at least some time well spent.
