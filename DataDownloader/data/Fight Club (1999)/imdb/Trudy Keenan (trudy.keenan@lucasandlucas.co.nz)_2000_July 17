This movie just blew me away.  I was not really sure of what the movie was
about and whether it would appeal to me.  However, after reading comments
from other IMDB users I watched it and what an impressive film!  There are
some movies you can watch and quickly forget, but others stay with you for
days afterwards and this movie is one of those.  <br /><br />Edward Norton's character, disillusioned with life and suffering from
insomnia, becomes addicted to self support groups after he attends one and
finding himself able to cry, in turn is able to sleep.  He meets up with
another addicted &quot;tourist&quot;, Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who with
this role should quash all ideas that she can only play period
dramas.
It would appear instant dislike between these two as they are such opposing
people.  However, he then has an encounter with Tyler Burden who takes him
on a spiral downwards into another whole world.  With a surprising twist at
the end, this film is certainly a roller coaster ride of emotions and
&quot;sucks&quot; you into the whole phenonomen of how one person can influence and
have a Svengali effect on groups of people.<br /><br />In my opinion Edward Norton should have got an Oscar for this movie, along
with the screenwriter!  <br /><br />A very interesting twist on what can happen to a person when they start
disbelieving in life and the &quot;must have&quot; dream.
