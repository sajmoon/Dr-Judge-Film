Where does one even start with this movie? It has to be one of the
smartest films ever made, and could be taken as course on modern
living, and its unlimited disappointments.<br /><br />The number of sentences that stick in my mind having watched this film
is incredible. It is choc-full of memorable quotes, and designs for
life.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is iconic as Tyler Durden - quite possibly the coolest
character in the history of film. Edward Norton went from being a
big-built neo-Nazi (American History X) to being a footstool of
corporate America in no time at all. Fair play to Helena Bonham-Carter,
whose character changes in the minds of the viewer towards the end of
the film, but who adds depth and humour to the film.<br /><br />The overall feel of this film, is one of rebellion. This is one of the
most important movies ever made, and deserves a place in the history of
cinema as a genuine groundbreaker.
