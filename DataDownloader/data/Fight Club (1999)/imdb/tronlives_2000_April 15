<br /><br />Like Rebel without a Cause (James Dean) was an outcrying of the younger
generation against the conservative middle-class families in America in
the
50`s , Fight Club is dedicated for all the lost souls in our generation
who
searches for a sense in their Life in a world of Calvin-Klein
Models,perfect
bodies
and the anonymous working ant- (&quot;some would recognize that they belongs to
them&quot;)which focused its Life in gaining consume goods and becoming a
,so-called, &quot;Winner&quot;.
I love this Film,the Actors are brilliant,especially Ed
Norton.
the Faint of our Society is not the only theme of this film - it has much
more to offer.It also shows how easy it is to manipulate people when
someone
knows their wishes and desires.
So i have to expand my statement - this film is dedicated to all
HUMANS.
One of the best films i have ever seen.Tribute to David
Fincher.
