FIGHT CLUB is the only movie that has really caught the essence of what
Generation X is all about. Also it is an excellent film.<br /><br />Firstly, the production design of the film is excellent in every aspect,
visually realizing the book in a way I thought could not be done. The thing
that really stands out is the film's editing between the CGI and reality, to
really get a sense of the narrator's confusion.<br /><br />Second, the script is top notch, with amazing dialogue and a wonderful
narration that is somehow a mix between A CHRISTMAS STORY's and A CLOCKWORK
ORANGE's.<br /><br />Third, the performances are great all around. Meat Loaf's Big Bob is a
highlight, as is Edward Norton's narrator (Jack) who goes from materialistic
yuppi to synic to philosipher to... you'll see. Helena Bonham Carter and
Brad Pitt are also at their best here.<br /><br />Fourth, the film's understanding of Generation X, The Lost Generation, is so
on target, because of the interaction between the narrator and Tyler, and
the narration itself. It explains how our dads were of starting new families
leaving us to have Nick at Nite as a father, how we are materialistic, and
how we don't know ourselves because we don't let other people know us.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB is the first film in a long time that has explained a generation
so well like EASY RIDER.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB was one of my favorite films the second I walked out of the
theater, and will continue to be for a long time.
