2006_April 2 
i was 14 years old when i first saw this film and thought it was a bit
weird an pushed it to back of my mind thinking that i was just a bit
thick and didn&#39;t understand it. like 90% of people who watch this film
i was expecting a pretty mindless film about bare knuckle boxing, and
being a 14 year old male that appealed to greatly, instead i
viewed,which at the time i thought, was a strange weird film. it wasn&#39;t
until the second time i saw the film i understood what it was truly
about and by the time i saw it the third time i was amazed at how
accurately it captures the real world. call me crazy but this film
altered my whole outlook on life, as a confused teenager this made
things clearer me and i cant help but think only the intellectuals
amongst us can truly appreciate this work of art. after watching the
film i read the book which is just as brilliant as the film but i do
think the film gives you a clearer image of what the book is trying to
say,exactly what a film based on a book should do, i have spoken to
many other people who agree with me that this film makes you look at
the world in its scary reality.
