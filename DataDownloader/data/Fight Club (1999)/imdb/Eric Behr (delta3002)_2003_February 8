This is a shocking film. Brad Pitt is perfect as a cool, psycotic rebell. A
movie with awesome fight scenes, a perfect cast, philosophy that makes sense
for once, a non-predictably gripping storyline, awesome graphics and a
relation to the audience that is not hard to see, but not to open either.
Fight Club is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I think it was under
credited at awards. Any one who thinks it is too brutal doesn't see the
beauty of this film. A perfect 10!!
