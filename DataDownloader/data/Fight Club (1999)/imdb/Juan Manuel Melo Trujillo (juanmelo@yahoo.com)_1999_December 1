Once again, Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance in this movie
that, however brilliantly told and shot, is not for all audiences.  You may
find people warning other people not to see this movie.  But if you watch
this movie, you will probably find yourself realising about your role in
life and society.<br /><br />Now this is the time for Oscars to Norton and Helena
Bonham-Carter.
