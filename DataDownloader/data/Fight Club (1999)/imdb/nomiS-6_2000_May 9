&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those films that was sadly promoted wrong, the
advertisments made this film out to be a bloody-fist fight mess wich granted
some parts are but very few parts.  The majority of the film is about Jake
(Edward Norton) a lonley, depressed man who hates his job and his life, to
escape this reality he creates an altered ego Tyler Durden played marvousley
by Brad Pitt.  David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) is a genius in visual
filmmaking and he diffently makes it known in this film! From the amazing
'brain traveling' credits to the barrel of the gun, and of course who could
forget the plane crash sequence... trust me rent it or buy it ASAP!!! You
will NOT regret it.
