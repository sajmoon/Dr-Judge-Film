2001_September 2 

I could go on and on about this movie, but everything has been said. I will
just say that I thought this movie deserved a better ending. I was glued to
my TV set the whole way, and I had hoped for an ending that left me with
the
hair standing up on the back of my neck. Unfortunately, I left asking,
&quot;Why?&quot; Why did it end that way? I've heard that the book had a much better
ending. In my mind, the ending of this movie will keep it off of my list of
All-Time Classics. What a shame. It's still a wonderful movie, and I'll
watch it again and again, but what a shame.
