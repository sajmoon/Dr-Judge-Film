&quot;Fight Club&quot; is unlike any other modern day film.  It ingeniously shows
through violence that emotions are not meant to be hidden or suppressed.
The film begins with a car company narrator (Edward Norton) who appears to
be reluctant of sharing his name with anyone.  Insomnia effects him for
several months until his doctor clues him into support meetings of
testicular cancer and Tuberculosis.  The meetings allow him relief for an
amount of time until another false tourist (Helena Bonham
Carter)interferes.
He once again becomes cursed with sleepless nights.<br /><br />Our narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) while on a business flight.
This leads to a wild downward spiral for the narrator and the things in his
life when this soap making sadistic mentor and he begin Fight Club for
emotionally scarred and misunderstood men.  I think that this movie was
very
under appreciated and even revoked by others. I think that you have to
understand that the film is not just about violence and senseless
therapeutic fighting, it is about human nature and how that can get in the
way of our impossible ideals.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; points out that no person is no better than another no matter
how rich or famous you are or may become.  The point of the movie is to be
happy with who you are and don't ever allow someone to steal your dignity,
pride and self-image no matter how much pressure builds upon the idealistic
preaching of a perfect world that will never be perfect.  The world will
always be imperfect unless you live.<br /><br />I would recommend this picture to movie buffs and people who like black
comedies, because it does have hilarious parts which aren't truly things
you
normally chuckle over, but you find yourself laughing.  The film has a lot
of brutal honesty that allows this unprecedented masterpiece to be an
unforgettable cinematic experience.<br /><br />
