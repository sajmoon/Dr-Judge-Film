The first time I saw &quot;Fight Club&quot; I despised it. I found its message
stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached
against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films
including &quot;The Matrix&quot; (which is not quite as realistic as &quot;Fight
Club&quot;). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it
was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it
much.<br /><br />However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just
because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's
now #41).<br /><br />Well I'm happy to report that I found &quot;Fight Club&quot; utterly brilliant on
third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on
DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic
performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler
Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; -
according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name
simple and soft).<br /><br />Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator,
&quot;Jack,&quot; whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't
seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep
analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to
say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and
David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and
sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I
won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so
many critics bagged on it for being &quot;a laborious dog&quot; on its initial
release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the
filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from
the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that
they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but
childish, and I can understand why some might view &quot;Fight Club&quot; as a
very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same
thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I
think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all
time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored
Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the
camera.<br /><br />And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is
a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but
then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared
too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start
now.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its
message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999.
In a year of some really good movies &quot;Fight Club&quot; was probably the best
and is one of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />It's easy to see how this might be considered the next &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;
thirty years from now.
