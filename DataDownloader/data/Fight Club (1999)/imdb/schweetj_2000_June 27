This film is great. Another reason why Norton is one of my favorite actors.
The film is great (much like 12 Monkeys) and has a cool surprise ending!
Pitt is good in it, too (basically reprising his role from 12 monkeys, only
he's tougher in this one). Chuck Palahniuk is a great young author (read his
novel Survivor) with a lot to say (the movie has a lot to say, too). Watch
this movie, it's not just about fighting.
