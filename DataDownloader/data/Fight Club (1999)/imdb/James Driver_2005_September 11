This film is portrayed by trailers etc that it is about fighting and
secret clubs in the underground etc, which of course it is. What it
misses however is that the plot evolves from this into a really quite
genius scheme of events.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays his role spectacularly and you empathise with him
perfectly through his journey. As the truth is slowly revealed and the
bigger picture revealed you have to notice the directing of David
Fincher as he displays the adrenaline and dilemma of the situation.<br /><br />Brad Pitt again performs amazingly, adding yet another type of
character to his list of characters hes able to depict. His smug views
and unwincing attitude throughout the film are definitely something
thats to be admired.<br /><br />Overall this film is unmissable in so many ways, the ending is
something to blow your mind ....(literaly)
