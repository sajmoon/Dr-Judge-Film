This is one of my favorite films. Fincher is superb here, as he usually
is.
After seeing this movie I read the book. The movie is great, but the book
is
brilliant. Chuck Palahniuk is able to do much more with the characters
than
could be adapted on screen.<br /><br />It is also very interesting to notice the tiny liberties Fincher took with
the story. A lot of the book didn't make the transition from book to
movie,
but the Fight Club is one of the greatest adaptations of novels to films,
once again proving the futility of the Oscars.<br /><br />Please read the book. Even if you didn't like the movie the book is still
great and you will probably like it anyway.
