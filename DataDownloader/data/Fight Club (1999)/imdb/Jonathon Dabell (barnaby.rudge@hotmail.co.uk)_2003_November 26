 Fight Club is a fierce satire and the blackest of black comedies. It is so
dark that many viewers won't even be able to appreciate the funny side of it
- they won't make it past the raw violence and the immoral attitudinizing.
However, if you don't mind an unorthodox narrative and you're not easily
offended, this is a terrific film.<br /><br /> Beleagured business man Jack (Edward Norton) is suffering from insomnia due
to the pressures and tedium of his job. He joins various macabre therapy
groups to keep himself entertained, and here he meets like-minded loner
Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). However, one evening whilst taking a flight
home, he finds himself sat next to an enigmatic, philosophical soap salesman
named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, in a career-best performance). Durden
befriends him and one subsequent evening they meet up in a bar, where they
eventually end up fighting with each other - not as the result of an
argument, but because they want to spice up their existence with the
adrenalin rush provided by fighting. They enjoy the event and pretty soon
they've set up &quot;Fight Club&quot;, a secret society at which men get to lose their
pent-up anger by beating each other to a pulp.<br /><br /> I'm not entirely convinced that fighting is the way to achieve the ultimate
high, nor am I convinced that to get into a fight is the best way to learn
how much of a man you are. However, that doesn't stop me from recognising
what an astounding film this is. The bizarre philosophies of Tyler Durden
are sometimes outlandish, sometimes agreeable and sometimes downright
disagreeable, but they are always entertaining. The exploration of what's
going on in the minds of these disturbed, depressed and desperate men is
fascinating, perceptive and often troubling, and it really jolts you out of
your comfort zone. Fincher directs in a dazzling, flashy style unlike
anything you'll have ever seen before, making this a truly original - though
ultraviolent - modern masterpiece. The final fifteen minutes or so shoot off
the scale in terms of manic revelations, with an incredible twist ending
that really shouldn't work, but somehow does. Fight Club is the kind of film
which reminds you why you fell in love with the movies!
