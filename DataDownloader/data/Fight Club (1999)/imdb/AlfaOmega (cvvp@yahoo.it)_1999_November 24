1999_November 24 

Pure nihilism.
The movie is strong accuse versus the contemporary society where everybody
have been loose the self-personality in the name of the aesthetic image.
But
we want true things or the system want them for us ?
The Mad become the Messiah, the people become the arm of the
god.
The night reign nearly for all the during of the movie, and the demote
room
increase the sense of decadence,in contrast with the splendor and
tranquility of the city during the day.
Is true that the movie is violence but the society where we live is almost
violence, remember that after a fight the deulist comeback friend (exclude
ed Norton and  Angel face, fight but in this case there is the total
pscycophatia of Narrator) in the real life  not become
that.
Is an incredible movie that can make us think.
Watch it !
