I can't comprehend why people think this movie deserves to be critically
acclaimed.<br /><br />David Fincher's masturbatory use of unnecessary, high-tech, cheesy
CG/camera
effects and poor, way-too-blue lighting rule out cinematography as a
virtue.<br /><br />The characters are one-dimensional and inordinately cynical; I think he was
trying to make the characters hip, but they come off as ridiculous
caricatures, amalgamated from various disillusioned 15-year-olds' journals.
As a result, said misfit teenagers (I am a teenager by the way), or
immature
adults that act like such teenagers, are the only people that have any
possibility of identifying with these characters.<br /><br />The dialogue is painfully cheesy and contrived, the Dust Brothers'
electronica soundtrack comes off as an out-of-place post-modern marketing
scheme, and the story is absolutely absurd.<br /><br />Nothing is special about the movie.  The movie does not &quot;challenge the
minds
of movie-goers.&quot;  It erases them.  Yes, it's entertaining, but for the love
of God, stop drooling over this movie.  I can't figure out why anyone likes
it; the only reason I can think of is the inherent homoeroticism.  If
you're
into that sort of thing.
