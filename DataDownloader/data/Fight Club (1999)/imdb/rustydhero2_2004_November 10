If this movie were any better, it would be fit for only God himself to
see... From the amazing cinematography and effects to the acting which
is so good, our English language lacks words to describe it. Brad Pitt
plays the perfect badass, while Ed Norton is the more quiet reserved
type, until he meets Tyler and gradually &quot;becomes what Tyler wants him
to.&quot; Helena Bonham Carter plays the part of Marla perfectly. On top of
all this there's an intricate story, and tons of tiny details scattered
throughout the movie. If you freeze frame through the 'Overview of
destruction' in the beginning, you can see into each and every office
and apartment on the way between explosives. There's EVEN A JANITOR
WORKING IN ONE OF THEM!Overall, the movie kicks major butt!
