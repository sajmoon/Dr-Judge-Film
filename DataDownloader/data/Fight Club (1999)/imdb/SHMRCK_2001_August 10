Having seen this film, and read the book, I don't get how people can not
understand what Fight Club is trying to say.  In a way, it is similar to
Office Space, American Beauty, and Trainspotting, showing the discontent
people feel with a monotonous life.  I don't think that this is a
life-changing film, but one that makes valid points at the problems that
many people experience in their lives.<br /><br />Visually, it is both brilliant, and very clever.  I don't think there is
anything negative that can be said about this film, except that it is too
complex for some people to understand it.<br /><br />If you can stand a more difficult film go see it.  If not, rent Gone in 60
Seconds.  That will be about your level.
