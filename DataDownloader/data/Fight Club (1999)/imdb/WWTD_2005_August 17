This film is quite possibly the best film in recent history. The
original book is a must read for a fan of this top caliber film. A
quick, easy read that provides great depth, and amazingly, quite a
different story than the film.<br /><br />Both are divine and the author himself actually disclosed that he
enjoyed the film's ending more than his own. The film is perfectly
structured, featuring a trio of protagonists, of which would normally
present disaster, but here the film blends a tango of terror
beautifully.<br /><br />The clean cut narrator (whose name is never revealed, but is assumed to
be Jack), meets the eccentric wild man Tyler Durden who begins to set
up an underground boxing match. The object is not to win the fight, but
to realize what it is to be a man.<br /><br />Once the men embrace their freedom, Tyler launches a plan that spirals
recklessly out of control, and &quot;Jack&quot;, who's always been the control
freak, can't handle it.<br /><br />Enter the third leg, Marla Singer. &quot;Jack's&quot; hate interest. The woman he
despises but can't force himself to get rid of. Tyler constantly
ravishes her to say the least. The fornication is overly absurd and
hilarious at the same time hearing the screaming from three floors
down.<br /><br />Overall, Tyler is a man on a mission. He is the ultimate spiritual
guru. Who is he? What does he represent or stand for? I'll let you
decide. This is as close to a divine film as you will find in today's
Hollywood.
