When I first saw this movie, I thought it was boring and dumb. Now that I
finally saw the whole thing, its awesome. Its not boring nor is it dumb, its
exciting, fast, and thrilling. It's a gory movie and extremely violent but
definatly recommend it. You really have to see it.
My MPAA rating: R for strong, brutal violence, language, sexuality, and drug
content.
