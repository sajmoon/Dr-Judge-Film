This was one of the best movies I've seen all year, but it fell short of
being as good as it could have been.  I thought the acting by the two
important cast members was excellent; I was especially impressed with the
development of Ed Norton's character.  The movie didn't try and be too
deep
and wasn't afraid to use humor to keep the story interesting.  The
characters were somewhat comical, but lent to the story well without being
one dimensional and silly.<br /><br />There were some flaws with this film though.  The movie tends to drag at
times when they just reinforce an aspect of the movie to make sure you get
it.  &quot;Tyler's anti-mainstream we get it, move on please&quot;; &quot; &quot;okay. they
fight move on please&quot;.  There are about three long dead spaces like this
in
the movie.  Unfortunately, from the big twist in the story to the end is
the
worst of these dead times. The movie should have ended right after the
twist.  The big finale seems irrelevant to the story and forced into the
plot.  The end seemed like an add-on that was not well explained or had
any
importance.  I can imagine the writers sitting around saying we need to
end
big, but I don't know how.  Just blow something up.<br /><br />The reason I bring out the negative points is because the Hollywood
laziness
that plagues the film industry reduced this movie from being a classic to
being a really good movie.  They had a good story, great acting, and a
moment in history for which the message was relevant, but they cut the
rope
short filled the movie with some dead space and threw together an
ending.<br /><br />In summary it was one of the best movies of the year, but fell short of
what
it could have been.
