Some movies go for stylized violence, a la &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Some<br /><br />take it to something very near ballet, like &quot;The Matrix.&quot; Others skirt<br /><br />the issue and blur the worst moments, as in the hospital scenes<br /><br />in &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;<br /><br />But the violence in &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a different breed - a raw,<br /><br />unadulterated sort that sears at your eyes during some of the<br /><br />intense sequences. It's back-alley stuff: bloodied knuckles and<br /><br />noses, bruises and lacerations, and all worn like Bronze Stars by<br /><br />the characters.<br /><br />And mixed in there is a sort of quasi-Nietzche cant, a half-formed<br /><br />philosophy that's equal parts Machiavelli and Unibomber.<br /><br />I'm not totally convinced by the intellectual end of the film - there<br /><br />are inconsistencies in the idealogies, though I appreciate the irony<br /><br />of the highly structured Fight Club made up of a bunch of<br /><br />anarchists.<br /><br />Roger Ebert makes mention of the &quot;Keyser Soze syndrome&quot;<br /><br />regarding the conclusion of the film, which has some merit - it<br /><br />does seem to unravel everything in a heartbeat, though there are<br /><br />subtle signs pointing to what's revealed in the closing act. It takes<br /><br />a little (well, perhaps a lot) of insight, but it's there in front of you if<br /><br />you're thinking as the movie goes along.<br /><br />Of course, the caveat to that is that the movie, with its torrent of<br /><br />violence and mayhem, makes it difficult to do anything but get<br /><br />swept along in the madness.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; warrants a few viewings - it's tough to say you love it or<br /><br />hate it after watching just once. You'll either appreciate the<br /><br />nuances after seeing it two or three times, or absolutely hate the<br /><br />oversaturated machismo of it all. It's up to you to take that
stand.
