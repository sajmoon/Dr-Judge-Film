1999_December 8 

From the opening credits I was enraptured with this movie. The throwaway
cleverness of the visuals, seen in the time-honored tradition of flashback,
lends further cynicism to a film saturated with the nihilistic posturings
and ideas from a very twisted and brilliant mind. I loved it - even though I
sort of knew what the film was about I was surprised by how sophisticated it
was. This is not a Brad Pitt film in the way that I imagine Meet Joe Black
to be (never saw it, the trailer was enough). He acts much the same as he
always did.<br /><br />Edward Norton is absolutely superb and the ultimate deadpan foil to the
fantastic sequences that occur in the film. He rightly takes the lead for
most of the movie and his sly, subversive comments are dropped with a poet's
precision into each circumstance that our erstwhile anti-hero finds himself
in.<br /><br />This is film belongs to the &quot;coming of age&quot; genre in that it is a voyage
into self-discovery and coming to terms with the world that we live in.
It'll change your outlook if nothing else.<br /><br />Must see.
