No point to hide it, this will be a very biased review
since
I'm a huge admirer of Finchers work. For me Se7en remains his best film to
date but this beast of a movie does not come far behind.<br /><br />Everybody raves about the performances of the actors but I think the real
standout was the dark and gritty visualization and Finchers tight no
non-sense directing. Ed Norton is the true star of the movie but Pitt also
does great job as Tyler Durden which is a perfect role for him.<br /><br />Also a great story and adaption of Palahniuks novel. Remarkable dialogue
too, there's so many memorable quotes in this movie and a lot of right on
the mark criticism pointed at modern human beings who as Durden puts it
work
jobs that they hate so that they can buy sh*t they don't
need.
If you're looking for a mainstream Hollywood action movie with the
fighting
being on the spotlight, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />But if you like your movies when they are super stylish, unique, thought
provoking, dark, funny and intelligent, then Fight Club definitely is your
cup of tee. Big time.
