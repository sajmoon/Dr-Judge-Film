I had to add some sanity to these reviews. Life changing? Puh-lease.
You need to get out more. And from the sounds of it you are. But
because of this slightly better than average movie? Wow.<br /><br />Pitt is over the top. He&#39;s good but he is a good actor and it&#39;s
expected. I typically like Norton but he does nothing for me in this
picture. The twist at the end is unique but you find yourself asking a
lot of questions that can&#39;t really be answered realistically about
situations that happened previously. So the twist doesn&#39;t wash for me.<br /><br />Before that I found the movie rather dull. Yeah, a bunch of guys start
a club where they fight and the actions of the club and club um,
owner/managers, get progressively more extreme.<br /><br />It&#39;s not a terrible movie but it&#39;s not in the top 1000 movies of all
time either. It&#39;s a solid 6 to 7 stars. Maybe 8 if you really like
Pitt, Norton, or Helen Bonham Carter. Though she was not particularly
noteworthy here either.<br /><br />The movie is well done. Shot nicely. Lighting and general
cinematography is why I rated it so high. It&#39;s stylish and very
effective in that area. But the overall plot, while unique, seems a bit
too out there for me. This is a Sixth Sense movie with fighting instead
of ghosts.<br /><br />Yeah, it&#39;s a decent movie. It&#39;s not special though.
