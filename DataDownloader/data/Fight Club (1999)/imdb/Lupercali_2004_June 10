That was my overwhelming feeling on re-watching 'Fight Club' last night.
Could you imagine this movie being released after 9/11? And I think that  if
I can take that a little further it might speak to the generally
unadventerous, uncontroversial, scared to put a foot wrong film making which
has been coming out of Hollywood in the past three years. But we don't have
room for that here.<br /><br />I watched Fight Club when it was first released and I didn't like it. In
fact I disliked it so much that I turned it off 3/4 of the way through.
Watching it four years later I can't imagine why I didn't stay riveted to
the set. Maybe back in 1999/2000 it had a bit more meaty
competition.<br /><br />Yet another film which you really can't talk about in too much detail
without spoiling, but let's allow this much: the main character is a yuppie
who, through a chance encounter with a charismatic stranger on a plane,
discovers the hollowness of his life, and uses physical violence and
self-injury as a means of liberating himself from it. Or so it all
seems...<br /><br />This is an audacious and confronting movie, artfully put together, with lots
of lovely scenes where the whole illusion of film-making is highlighted.
Characters suddenly speak to the audience or walk through a scene which
morphs into a furniture brochure. And there are more, and more pivotal
shocks of this kind to come.  It's funny, smart, unexpected, brutal, and
takes no prisoners.  The only thing which lets it down and keeps it from
being an almost perfect movie, IMO, is that the ending (an albeit
marvelously unexpected ending) just starts to push credibility to its
breaking point, even for a film which doesn't take itself entirely
seriously.<br /><br />Still, this film is currently averaging a score of 8.5, and I'd say that's
about right.
