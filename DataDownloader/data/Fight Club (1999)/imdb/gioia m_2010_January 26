Changes perspective, gets you out of routine mechanisms, makes you
think and interpret! Brilliant! You don&#x27;t waist time watching, it is
not for entertainment purpose kind of movie. I put it on the classics
movies, ones that you&#x27;ll keep close to re-view it. The atmosphere and
dark humor are spicing well this movie and of course the acting is
strong. After I saw it I was &#x22;wow&#x22; and I had to tell my friends: I just
saw an incredible movie : Fight Club! I mention that I have seen it
about 1 year ago even if it&#x27;s made in 1999. I did not know the subject
before watching (I prefer that when I see a movie, in order to be
surprised 100% if possible. A must see by anyone, no matter preferences
in movie area. Cannot make detail analyse, criticism, or tell the
subject : It has been a while since I saw the movie but I remember the
strong feeling I had after seeing it! I have to see it again soon :).
(I have it on DVD).
