I missed this in the theaters because I thought it was just another vehicle
for showing Brad Pitt's chest, but bored in my hotel room one night, I felt
like watching a violent movie (New York does that to you).<br /><br />First of all, the movie has that modern style that's typical of Fincher.  If
you were raised on a steady diet of MTV and cable TV, you'll love the dark
images and wild editing.  I'm buying the DVD just to watch it all over
again, it looks that good.<br /><br />But the story is what got me.  The plot twist towards the end woke me up and
had me freaked out.  Not as good as some others, but it made the movie a
&quot;10&quot; in my opinion, whereas it was headed for a decent
&quot;7.&quot;<br /><br />Drew.
