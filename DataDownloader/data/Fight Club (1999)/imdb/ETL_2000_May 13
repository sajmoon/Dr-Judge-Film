Yes, you heard me right. The violence vs. consumer culture is only a
sub-theme in this movie. If you dig a little deeper, you will find that this
movie is really about insanity. It is one the first movies to take us inside
the mind of a madman. And it shows up an internal battle between the free
&quot;do what I feel like when I feel like it&quot; macho guy and the scared moral
materialistic vulnerable guy. The free and the restrained. Both are towards
the extremes. This race toward the edge destroys the world or the world as
the main character sees it. It destroys his reality. I think this movie is
really about what is called &quot;the middle path&quot; by Buddists. It's a very
creative and visually mind blowing way of portraying it.<br /><br />
