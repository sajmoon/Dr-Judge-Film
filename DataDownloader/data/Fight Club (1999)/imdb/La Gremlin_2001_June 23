Let me say this right off the bat.  This is one of those movies that you're
either going to love or hate.  But no matter what, DO NOT MISS
IT!<br /><br />I really don't want to say too much about &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  To try and describe
it would spoil it.  Just know that this is possibly the most insanely
subversive movies in a *really* long time and that you'll probably go,
&quot;Woah, wait a minute...&quot; more than once.<br /><br />And, love it or hate it, you will not be able to get it out of your
head.<br /><br />&quot;Slide!&quot;
