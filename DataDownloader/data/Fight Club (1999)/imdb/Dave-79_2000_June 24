Aside from the what has already been said regarding Fight Club, there are
some exceptionally brilliant moments in this movie.  The first 40 minutes
are the most intriguing for me.  I especially liked Edward Norton's
character and his narration concerning the support groups, insomnia,
material posessions, his condo, and his work.  I particularly enjoyed his
negotiating with Marla on how to split up the support groups.  When he and
Tyler have their first fight there is a pause, and he says, &quot;Let me tell you
something about Tyler Durden.&quot;  Then he goes into this whole thing about the
part time jobs which Tyler holds.  That little digression is perhaps one the
most brilliant five minutes in film I have seen.  Although this movie really
is a &quot;Dark Comedy&quot; of sorts, there are many socially true statements made. 
For instance, Tyler saying, &quot;The things you own end up owning you.&quot; 
Exactly!  The imagry throughout the film is fantastic.  Apart from the fight
sequences, which are well crafted, we have the cave sequences with the power
animal...great stuff! And of course that old abandoned house.  Edward Norton
and Brad Pitt have some of the best on-screen chemistry I have seen.  They
blend perfectly.  This is the best chemistry Norton has had with another
actor since his work with Matt Damon in Rounders.  Overall, Fight Club
approaches a rare perfection.  The dialog and narration are its greatest
strengths.  Easily one of the top 5 movies of 1999.
