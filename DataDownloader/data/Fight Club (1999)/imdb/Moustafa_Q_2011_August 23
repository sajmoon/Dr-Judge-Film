Negative existential mood and themes as spiritual torpor, inability to
communicate or to feel or receive love. Images of ambiguous shadows and
grotesque signs. Game between victim and butcher. The innocence of
childhood like material for create a new seed of nightmare.<br /><br />Pieces of lost life. Flavors, memories and slices of hate. Corpses of
words and bizarre relationship . The fear must have a only answer-
terrible universal hate.<br /><br />For David Fincher, the existence is eternal fight with the Angel. Same
cruel Angel and his ordinary contempt for the other. And this war is
essence of any existence. It is source of hope and silence, expectation
and subtle search of truth. In a world of a &#x22;Deus otiosus&#x22;, nothing is
more that sterile convention.<br /><br />A parable, harsh, arid, sombre. Reflection of death and deep sin. Vain
exploration of world- huge hotel with ambiguous characters and
deceptive passages. Same cruel fighting game of &#x22;The Umberto D.&#x22;.
