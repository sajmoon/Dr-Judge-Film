This is _very_ black. In some ways quite brilliant, but not for the
faint-hearted. Everything in the film is understated, even though it's taken
to extremes. Nothing is introduced that isn't used later on. And it's so ,
so , black - did I mention that? However, add to that blackness a genuine
humour that makes it stand even above the peak of the Coen brothers' black
humour (Blood Simple and Fargo, for example).
