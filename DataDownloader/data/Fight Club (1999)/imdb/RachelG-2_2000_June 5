2000_June 5 

After my fiance pestered me for 3 weeks about how great &quot;Fight Club&quot; was, I
finally saw this film.  Yuck.  I thought this film was a big ol' waste of
time, and I could watch Edward Norton do almost anything on film and be
entertained.  It wasn't what I expected, I was prepared for the violence and
general dark atmosphere of the film so that was fine, but the plot was so
whacked that it was ludicrous to even try to follow it.  C'mon, with that
kind of ending, do you really expect me to think that was a natural
conclusion after the rest of the film?  Please.<br /><br />I know there are &quot;guy&quot; flicks, just like &quot;chick flicks,&quot; and I strongly
suspect that this is a guy flick all the way.  Women, I warn you that you
will probably be wishing for something else to do about 1/3 into the film. 
Bring a book.
