You are nothing special.  In fact, your mother loathes the day her bosom was
smithed with your stinking presence.  This is one of the messages of Fight
Club, an incredibly awesome film, by David Fincher, maker of films and fine
sedatives.  This movie can be best described as twelve servings of intensity
made to seem smaller so that they could be taken as two servings.  A new
story-telling style is introduced every five minutes, and the characters
keep evolving.  Who are these guys?  Neo-realists?  Be careful, and look out
for realist gangs, who've been terrorizing the desolate streets of our
cities, for half a century.  Edward Norton is incredible as the
self-delluding, self-perpetuating loser.  (How is he any different than me?)
 Brad Pitt is incredible as Tyler Durgen, the Zorathustrian gang leader of
Fight Club.  Helena Carter is great as Tyler's main squeeze.  She is one
spooky chick in this movie!  My only problem is the end.  I don't want to be
the &quot;you just ruined the movie, you idiot!&quot; guy, but in the end, was Fincher
expecting that anyone was still watching the film, or that everyone was
making out by now?  Rating: 10/10 (As far as bleakness goes, this one's
worse than Se7en)
