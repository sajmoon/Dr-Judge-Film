This is one superb movie, I didn't get to see it at the movies because I
wasn't 18 at the time (damn Australia), so I read the book and was so
impressed I preordered the DVD, this movie is terrific, people whine how the
movie goes down hill when Tyler comes into the picture. I have no idea why
people think this, he has the best view on life. Ed Norton gives us another
terrific performance, he has always been my favorite actor. Fincher
demonstrates once again what a terrific and innovative director he is, his
last two movies The Game and Seven were superb (I still think Seven probably
has the best ending to a movie). People always critisise this movie for its
violence, if some people look a bit deeper and actually watch the movie
properly then they will see that this is one hell of a movie. Easily my all
time favorite movie. A definite 10/10
