This movie was wierd and messed up but really cool at the same time. Much
of
the movie is boring, some of it is hilarious, but the ending tight. It's
one
of those movies that you can't get out of your head after you see it, and
the more you think about it, the cooler it is. The 2nd time I saw it,
since
I actually understood it, I picked up on a whole lot more stuff and liked
it
even more.
