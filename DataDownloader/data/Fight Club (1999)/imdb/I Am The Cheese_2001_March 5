What we have here is quite possibly the finest use of celluloid in
history.<br /><br />This film is just outstanding on so many levels it's shunning by The Academy
at The Oscars just goes to show how out of touch and inbred they
are.<br /><br />We have Brad Pitt giving the performance of his career, and Edward Norton
showing once again his talent, and even Helena Bonham Carter proves there's
more to her than Merchant Ivory productions.  The script is witty, fresh,
and eminently quotable, the soundtrack a masterpiece (courtesy of The Dust
Brothers), and the whole thing looks fantastic.<br /><br />Your life is ending one second at a time, and this better take up (rough
estimate) 7860 of them, or Eternal Damnation will be next on the
horizon.<br /><br />VIEW/BUY/RENT/STEAL!!!
