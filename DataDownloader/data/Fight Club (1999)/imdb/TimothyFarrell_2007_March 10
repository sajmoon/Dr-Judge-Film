This film (and its response) reminds one of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Some
critics complained about the film being pro-violence, heavy-handed, and
pure style over substance. Others have acclaimed it as a masterpiece,
one of the few mainstream films that actually contains a message. I&#39;m
in the later camp, as I think &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of the best films of
the decade. As just like Alex DeLarge, many people didn&#39;t realize that
Tyler Durden is the villain. It could&#39;ve used a little more subtlety,
but I can&#39;t complain because whereas film buffs are more used to
multi-layered films, this is about as subversive as mainstream
audiences could handle. Its also a very detailed film, so repeated
viewings are required.<br /><br />David Fincher is an overrated filmmaker, but for once he created a
masterpiece. The film has the same MTV-style editing that makes
everything as quickly paced as possible, but for once it serves a
purpose rather than just style. The acting all around is very good.
Edward Norton once again proves to be one of the most talented actors
in Hollywood today, with his narrator a truly classic protagonist. His
narration ranks with &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; as the greatest in film. Brad
Pitt, an actor who can try too hard at times, does a good job. The man
has been in some horrible films (&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, &quot;Seven Years In
Tibet&quot;), but when hes good, hes really good. Just witness &quot;Kalifornia&quot;,
&quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;, or this. Helena Bonham Carter is just as fine as
either Norton or Pitt. Its a shame she didn&#39;t become a bigger star.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a film that is surrounded by controversy, but I feel in
a decade or so it&#39;ll be recognized as the masterpiece it is. (10/10)
