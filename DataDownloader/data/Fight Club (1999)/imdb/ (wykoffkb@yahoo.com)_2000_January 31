so i've been trying to figure out what disturbs me so much about 'fight
club'.  it of course is
not the social implications that i see critics talking about; i couldn't
give a shit less.
It's all been said before and don't think anyone can give a new angle on
that one.<br /><br />it's that here's a guy all on his own.  no close friends, no close
relationships.  business
trips for a living.  i don't think, like a review i've read says, that he
is
frustrated
by a boring job; his job isn't boring, it's absolutely revolting.  it's not
an impersonal,
mechanized society he lives in.  it's soothing and smothering and
completely
analyzed.<br /><br />he's very intelligent and probably has a good heart. he lives his life in a
detached state; watching, mildly alarmed, lazily but enthusiastically
performing his duties as a consumer.  there's a sense of emptiness in him
that i immediately
recognize.  it's been ever-present but growing lately in my own life.<br /><br />on top of the emptiness there's an intense feeling of loneliness.  not just
the absence of
people, but the absence of anything greater than ourselves.  i surround
myself with people,
but the feeling never goes away.<br /><br />why was tyler recruiting idiots?  i don't think he gave a shit about fight
club or about
society.  i think he was trying to make the narrator someone else.  the
person he could be.
maybe it's the ultimate in self-love (although i don't understand the
ball-cutting part.  you'd
think i was in tyler's best interest not to have that happen).  maybe
that's
what was so
disturbing.  he ultimately saved himself.  nobody else could.<br /><br />maybe it was more a story about living.  so many of us are spectators now,
i
often wonder
who is doing the producing, the generating, the creating.<br /><br />unlike the matrix (which i loved also, but for different reasons), this
movie was very
personal.  it gets under your skin.  so the matrix produces an 'oh shit'
feeling.  fight club
gives me a shaky, murky, heavy, turned-on feeling.<br /><br />it saddens me a bit that this is seen as a 'guy' movie.  i'm very much a
girlie-girl and
this has to be my favorite movie ever.  the images and the overall feelings
it left me with
are going to stay in my dreams for a while.  i don't even like brad pitt
who
didn't disappoint -
he played the same role he always plays - the aloof, mysterious, enigmatic
guy.  it's edward
norton that won my heart along with the brilliant script and the kick-ass
cinematography and
the narration, the narration, ...
