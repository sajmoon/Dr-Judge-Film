The Eight Ways Fight Club will change your life...<br /><br />1.  Brad Pitt no longer is a sissy.  He now commands your respect as a
man, and an actor as well.<br /><br />2.  Every survey you fill out the rest of your life, you'll have to
fight the urge to write &quot;Robert Paulsen,&quot; &quot;Tyler
Durden,&quot; &quot;Rupert,&quot; &quot;Travis,&quot; or &quot;Cornelius&quot; in the 'Name'
blank.<br /><br />3.  You'll want to read the book, by Chuck Palahniuk<br /><br />4.  You won't want to eat in a restraunt again for a long, long
time.<br /><br />5.  You'll always do your homework.<br /><br />6.  You will look in the newspapers for support groups.<br /><br />7.  You will trim your fingernails and cut your hair short.<br /><br />8.  You will never look at a bar of soap the same way again.
