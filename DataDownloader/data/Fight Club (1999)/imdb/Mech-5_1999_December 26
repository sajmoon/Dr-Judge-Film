Fight Club.  A film that proves David Fincher has the talent for directing.
In the beginning I did not pay much attention to Fight Club but when I went
to see it, I was overcome with a sudden unexplainable glee.  From beginning
to end it was non stop in terms of interest.  That is one way to sum up
Fight Club.<br /><br />What makes Fight Club so good?  For me it was not the fights but the story
behind the fights.  Not even that, it was the way the story behind the
fights was unfold.  With witty and smart dialogue from both Edward Norton
and Brad Pitt, it is hard not to ignore their words.  This film made me
understand that Brad Pitt to not be just another pretty face in a crowd of
beautiful people, but a serious actor.<br /><br />Of course the clincher was the direction.  Like Seven and The Game the same
dark and gloomy atmosphere was used.  Even the most brightest areas of the
movie had a dark feeling to it.  Fight Club had perfect camera angles and
special effects that is both pure eye candy and meaningful, enough to
satisfy the special effect buff.<br /><br />One last thing is the content.  There is absolutely no dull parts in Fight
Club.  With direction, dialogue, cast, delivery, etc., Fight Club would
literally burst if anything more would to be added.  Saying this, one would
HAVE to see it twice to satisfy the need for more after the first watching.
One last bit of advice when watching Fight Club, open your mind, but not
too
much.
