FIGHT CLUB stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as two men who form an
underground club where people fight, and the hype catches on with people
around the country.  This is an entertaining movie with good leads and
acceptable fight scenes, but it's barely passable at best.  The plot is
unbelievably dumb, there are a few plot holes and the story fails to make
sense at some points.  Pitt and Norton carry the film, but the other
characters are one-dimensional and have little or no interest.  The movie is
well worth a watch, but it's still a disappointment.<br /><br />2 out of 5
