This, along with Amores Perros and The Green Mile, is one of the most
overrated movies on this site. Merely utilizing the common modern technique
of 'things not being what they seem' does not make a great movie.  Here, the
technique is meaningless.  
And yes, our society is excessively consumer-driven and not passionate or
honest enough.  But people were supposed to learn values that make them
aware of that in grade school.  If they haven't learned this lesson by now
in life, they aren't going to be smart enough to get it from an
intentionally complex film.  On top of that, I am not even sure that Fincher
is truly criticizing our domesticated society.  It seems that the rebels are
the real problem in his film.
I have seen people here compare this film to A Clockwork Orange.  That is
like comparing Corey Maggette to Michael Jordan.  Or Mobsters to The
Godfather.
