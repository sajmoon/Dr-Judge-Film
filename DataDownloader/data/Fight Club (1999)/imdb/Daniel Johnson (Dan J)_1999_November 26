The only word I could muster after watching Fight Club was &quot;wow&quot;. Never have
I seen a film which dazzled me so much visually and teased me mentally. Me
and my friends are still discussing it now even though we watched it last
week.<br /><br />I heard all the pre film hype before watching it and went in with an open
mind and thought it was brilliant. The performances in the film are
outstanding and Norton is rapidly becoming one of the most talented actors
around. His performance in fight club is excellent and I was also personally
amazed by Meat Loafs performance. I didn't think Fincher could make a film
that would better Seven but I'd say Fight Club is now his most accomplished
piece of work. You really have to admire David Finchers ability to use his
undeniable talent to tell a story. Some of the visuals in this film simply
ooze with originality, the Ikea catalogue walk through scene is pure and
simply brilliant.     <br /><br />The one aspect that surprised me about Fight Club was not the corkscrew
finale but how funny it was. At times especially in the opening third it had
me and most of the audience in stitches.<br /><br />Movie making does not get any better than this, Fight Club is a thought
provoking film. In a perfect world all films would be as good as this.
