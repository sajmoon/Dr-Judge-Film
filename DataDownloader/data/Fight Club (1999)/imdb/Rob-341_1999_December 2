1999_December 2 

Every once in a while you see a film that changes your
outlook
on the world in which you live. I can say that Fight Club
is
one of those rare films. It's an intelligent, thought-provoking and
shocking
film that challenges the viewer's ideas and beliefs. This is what the art
of
movie making is all about.
Using this movie as a yard stick, you realise just how
bad
most movies being produced by Hollywood these days really
are.<br /><br />And to all those American kids weaned on MTV and Friends;
do
not go to see this film. You will need an attention span of more than 30
minutes to understand the plot. Go to the mall,
buy some overpriced poor quality clothing
produced in sweat shops in south east Asia instead. You'll probably
consider
it a better way to spend two hours of your life.<br /><br />Carpe Diem.
