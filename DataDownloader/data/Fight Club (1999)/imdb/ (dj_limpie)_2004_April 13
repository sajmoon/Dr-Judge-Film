Fight Club was one of the most surprising and intrigious films I have ever
seen.<br /><br />I like an special story and this is certainly one ... it's not only funny,
but it is also fabulous filmed and the ending is IT of IT.<br /><br />Fight Club is one of my favourites. Every filmfan has to see this movie
...
the film is a little strange and boring(sorry), but the ending makes
everything fabulous. A film that is superb and outstanding!!<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays good, but Edward Norton is certainly a superb actor.. and
he
proves it in this movie. ONE TO WATCH...<br /><br />A well thought storyline, a great actor-achievement and a beautifull
special
effects film. The dvd provides you with the making of and some sequences
of
the making of in different angles. A MUST HAVE...
