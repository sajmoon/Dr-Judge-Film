<br /><br /> Fight Club is the best film of last few years. Technically brilliant, with
superb story, acting and profound psychological and social content. Fincher
is by far the most innovative and creative  American director after Stanley
Kubrick.<br /><br />This film is deeply philosophical and focusing on 'the meaning of life'
concept. 
The story starts rolling with the depiction of the dissatisfying life of the
main character. He tries to fill the existential void with goods, he tries
to bond with people in sobbing and sharing about their pain and misfortunes,
in the end nothing fills the void. Edward Norton's character is disgusted
with the nihilism he sees around him - the superficial corporate greed with
it's corporate pawns. Life falsifying and denigrating consumerism, which
reduces individuals to mindless drones and leads them to believe that
gathering material possessions, looking outwardly according to norms would
make them happy. In essence the character gets sick with all the excessive
socialization, all the unnecessary symbols of conformism and social status
which leave him alien to himself. The character is confused who and what he
is and what he essentially wants. 
He's only recourse is to the core of his being, his body. It's chemical
mechanisms are simply rewarding or punishing, there is nothing less real or
unadulterated in human existence. The corpus doesn't  prevaricate. It
transmits the signals and mind simply receives and interprets them. The
signals are utterly authentic and that's Palahniuk's  probable justification
for the fighting and the violence, which was cruel but based on consent,
much like courageous, ultramasculine boxing and ultimate fighting contests.<br /><br />Pain and pleasure are unifying sensations between all people and also the
signs of human separatedness from the world and the signs of individual
corporality. Circumstantial changes in endocrinological hormonal secretions
are often addictive and artificially sought in our culture.<br /><br />First half of the film revels in consumerist critique and finding a way for
these, mostly lonely and slightly alienated men to endure the nihilism of
their existence. After the bonding has happened and Tyler Durden is awarded
the status of a great visionary,a spiritual leader much like most autocrats
have been raised to their throne by unsuspecting people (Hitler, Mao etc) 
the film takes a leap forward and starts analyzing the psychology of
revolutionary activity and revolutionary groups.<br /><br />Tyler starts project Mayhem and goes further and further into anarchistic
activities to take the power back and overturn this spirit eroding, life
degrading social system.<br /><br />Fight Club's analysis of revolution is a lot smarter and deeper than the one
in Matrix because the end part is raising the question 'why does revolution
always seem to eat it's children?'. Why do idealistic men wanting to improve
the society  and the situation of countless humans end up instituting the
most violent and gruesome regimes. <br /><br />What is so flawed in human nature that turn good intentions to often even
worse oppression than the one before? 
The references to Maximilien Robespierre, Lenin and Hitler are quite obvious
in this film. 
The lead character wanted to liberate men from socialization, to enhance
their individuality but ended up removing their individuality, denigrating
and sacrificing them in the name of greater good. He sacrificed his own
ideals, thus the fight in the end and another reference to historical
revolutionaries. Robespierre who was responsible for the 'reign of terror'
era of the French revolution got his jaw shot off before taken to the
guillotine.   <br /><br />
