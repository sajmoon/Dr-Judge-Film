that there will be a Fight Club re-release on dvd which they have stopped
doing. The reason I say this is because if anyone knows sound wise, DTS
is
much better than Dolby Digital, they have to put out a DTS version of the
movie, cause I mean good lord its Fight Club, not some fruit loops
commercial!!!
