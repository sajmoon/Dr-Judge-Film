this film is a must see movie, if you haven't seen it you're missing
out. again finch uses Brad Pitt for a main role, referring to his older
film seven, but Pitt does well in the hard psychological character of
Tyler Durden that he plays, pulling off every part of the characters
fragile mind. of course another fanatic performance in the film was by
Edward Norton who plays the his fantastically, with the character's
mind turned upside down you can feel his pain. i do love the directing
on this film though ever film i've seen by David Fincher i have loved,
he is a genus at film making (though i must point out that i haven't
watched all of them so there might just might be a bad film of his out
there but i still don't care as i love his work that i've seen).
