From the director of the 1995 masterpiece 'Se7en' comes a new thriller
from
acclaimed director David Fincher. His direction is great in both films,
but
this one stands out as one of the best films of 1999. Edward Norton and
Brad
Pitt are plain awesome, their performances are brilliant. While Pitt and
Norton impress, the screenwriter Jim Uhlus, also shows a lot of confidence
in
script-writing.<br /><br />In all areas, Fight Club excels beyond belief, and I highly recommend
it.<br /><br />Rating: 10
