2000_January 9 

I'd heard a lot about this film being the movie of the decade etc. so when
I
eventually got to see it I was left wondering what all the fuss was about.
The film starts off by making a fair point about males being demasculated
with all the political correctness going on, but to insinuate that what
the
inhibited millennium man really wants to do is knock f**k out of each
other,
doesn't wash with me, and what was a good basic premise, turns into
cartoon
violence.<br /><br />Although, the
cinematography was excellent and the performances outstanding, I felt that
the basic message of the film was naff and that the violence, instead of
making a point, was second-rate Jaackie Chan/Jean-Claude Van Damme and
would
ultimately appeal to that audience. Maybe I missed something, but I left
the
cinema with a sour taste in my mouth and the disappointment that this
wasn't
the film I'd been led to believe it was.
