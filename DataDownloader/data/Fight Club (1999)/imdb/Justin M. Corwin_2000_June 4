Fight Club ended up being one of the biggest surprise masterpieces ever... I
went to see it expecting a weird but entertaining movie, what I got is a
hilarious piece of social commentary injected with just the right amount of
humor, gripping dialogue, and the most incredible ending that just leaves
you floored! Edward Norton was absolutely fantastic and Brad Pitt definitely
added to the movie by using some of his badassness from Seven.  There are
many scenes that just amazed me as original yet so compatible to how I think
movies should be.  If there is one downfall it is that there is no chance
for a sequel.
