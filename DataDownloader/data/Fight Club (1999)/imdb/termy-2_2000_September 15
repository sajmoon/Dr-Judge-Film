This is almost certainly the equivalent of an acid-trip on film. The whole
experience(this is not like any movie ever seen before!) is one of complete
and utter absorbtion from start to finish. From the opening scene you're
hooked &amp; before you know it, you've been sucker-punched by the last 20
minutes. Fincher is a director in a class of his own (apart from 'The Game',
which was spoiled by an ending which went against the whole context of the
film) &amp; will almost certainly be compared to Kubrik (amongst others) in
years to come.After the movie is done, just try and come back to
normality...not as easy as you think?! Give in this movie, it is an
experience like no other.
