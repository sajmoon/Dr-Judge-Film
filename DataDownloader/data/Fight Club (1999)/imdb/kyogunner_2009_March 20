This is the best script ever written for me. I have never seen a movie
with plots that is so dark but clever at the same time. The writer has
done a very good job and i give him a star for his incredibility in his
work. This is a great movie and a classic. On will remember this movie
from time to time. Against the system, it grabs your intention from the
beginning. You wont expect what the story brings you until you reach
the end. I really hope to watch something like this again. This story
deserved an Oscar for the storyline. The actors have done a good job
especially three main characters, Norton, Pitt and Carter. I rate this
movie 10 over 10. Don&#39;t miss this movie!
