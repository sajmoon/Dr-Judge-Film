Fight Club blew me out of my seat 6 times in 8 days. Edward Norton has
become quite the notable actor and Brad Pitt, well, I disliked his acting
up
until I saw Fight Club.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen this, it is most definitely the quintessential
movie of the millenium and the next. And of course, the plot, it's not what
you think.
