It is a rare thing that there is a book that I really love and when I
finally see the film made of that book that I think that film is up to
scratch. Fight Club, however, cracks it! I loved the book, and although
I was quite late seeing the film and quite apprehensive to see it as It
thought it could ruin the book for me forever when I did see, I loved
it just as much if not more.<br /><br />Brilliantly Acted by a perfectly chosen cast, the film is a violent
film and will shock many but, as most think, this film isn't just about
violence, it is about something important. Come to this film with an
open mind and prepare to have something to think about because thats
the kind of film it is. This really isn't just a violence-fest with no
significance or plot, it is a truly superb film.<br /><br />An all time favourite of many, including myself and a film you really
should see..
