2002_October 5 

I must admit, the first time I saw Fight Club I was visually, mentally and
emotionally overstimulated; however, at the prompting of a friend, I
watched
it again and was able to grasp and appreciate the raw, brutal honesty
portrayed in it.  It's reminiscent of Wall Street in that it critiques our
generation, our attitudes, the environment we either helped to create or
continue to perpetuate by doing nothing to stop it.
Others have commented on the brilliance of the cast and crew (most
especially David Fincher and Ed Norton), so I will avoid that topic.  I
will
say, however, that the movie prompted me to read Chuck Palahniuk's book
(of
the same name, on which the movie is based), and this taught me it is
always
better to read the book after the movie than vice versa.  If you enjoy the
movie, and I'm willing to bet you will, please read the book--there are so
many profound observations and character insights for which the movie
simply
has no room (that is, time).  I highly recommend any of his other books,
especially _Survivor_, which may or may not be made into a movie (in the
post-9/11 American society, it is hard to find a studio willing to back a
project with a [bloodless] plane hijacking).
If you don't like the movie the first time around, please give it a second
chance.  Watch it again--and then again, and again.  You'll find more
details, clues, special authenticating touches every time you see
it.
