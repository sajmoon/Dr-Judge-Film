1999_November 15 

Definitely one of the great movies of 1999, a worthy flick to end the decade
that has given the world such classics as Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant and
stuff by the great Asian directors John Woo and Takeshi Kitano.<br /><br />Fight Club is near to visual perfection, walking in the footsteps of
Fincher's previous masterpiece, Seven, but surpassed, though, by The Matrix.
It is violent, venomous and ... hilarious.<br /><br />It is advisable not to eat too much before going to see it, because at least
one scene with Pitt, Norton and the bag of raw material for soap made me
feel quite a bit of nausea. And it's VERY hard to make me feel nausea...<br /><br />The icing on the cake for me was Pixies' &quot;Where Is My Mind&quot; at the end of it
all. A perfect way to end a perfect movie.
