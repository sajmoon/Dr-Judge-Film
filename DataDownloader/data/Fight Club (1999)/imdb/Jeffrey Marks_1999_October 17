1999_October 17 

I really enjoyed this movies.... And I hated it as well. The movie was done
well and had some great parts, but never came together as a whole. I really
think this movie had the same problems that Fincher's last movie (The Game)
had.... It lands a huge surprise on you and then forces you to believe it
even though it doesn't work at all with the movie. In &quot;The Game&quot; it didn't
bother me as much because that was more of a &quot;fun&quot; film, where as Fight Club
actually proports to say something about society. It's worth seeing, but
just the &quot;The Emporer's New Clothes&quot;, this movie proports to be so much, but
is really nothing.
