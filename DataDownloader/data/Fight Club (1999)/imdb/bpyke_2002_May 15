david fincher does an excellent job of revealing just enough to keep the
viewer interested, while concealing just enough to leave the viewer in a
state of wonder and quasi-confusion.  So many elements are involved within
the characters, and Fincher waits until the bitter end to fully develop and
reveal unnerving truths.  A dramatically intelligent film put together by
one of the true artists of his time.  Fincher's track record speaks for
himself, with the likes of Seven, The Game, and The Panic Room.  An
extensive and impressive resume, Fincher is a true filmmaking genius.
Tyler
Durdan and crew dazzle audiences with stellar performances to compliment a
fabulous storyline and plot.  On a scale of 1 to 10, this film is a 37.
