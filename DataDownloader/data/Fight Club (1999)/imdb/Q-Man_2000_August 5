2000_August 5 

I rented Fight Club with reservations. I thought it was a film about a bunch
of guys beating each other senseless, but the reviews were good. The film
was much more than I expected and held my interest from beginning to end. It
is a movie that you will think about long after you have seen it. I would
have originally rated it a &quot;6&quot;, but a week later I raised that to a &quot;7&quot;. I
was tempted to go higher, but it has been months since I have seen it, and I
know there were parts where I thought &quot;oh, come on, this is bordering on
ridiculous&quot;. 
It is a great commentary on modern society told with lots of insight and a
surprising amount of humor. I didn't expect a &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but started
to suspect that things were not what they seemed to be. Now when people ask
me if I have seen any good movies recently, the Fight Club is the first one
I recommend.
Although I have no desire to be beaten to a pulp or to do that to anyone
else, I could certainly identify with many of the ideas expressed by Edward
Norton's character.
