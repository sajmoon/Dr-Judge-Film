My husband talked me into this after time and time again saying &quot;I don't
want to watch a movie about fighting&quot;, I guess he thought the beginning was
better than I thought it was...<br /><br />I guess if you get kicks out of people whose lives are completely the dumps
then watch this movie.  It's only mildly amusing before the fighting if
you're a mentally stable person.
