WOW! - An instant CLASSIC! I may as well stop here; I highly recommend
going to watch this movie especially before reading any further or
anything about it from anyone.<br /><br />This is a story about Tyler Durden, he looks like we want to look, acts
like we want to act, and says what we want to say. He is sexy, smart
and strong. He is what all men want to be, carefree and living in the
moment without worry of what happens next and the balls to do anything
he has ever wanted to do.<br /><br />This unique story for the movie revolves around the notion that we are
living for consumer products, and those products are ending up owning
us instead of the other way around. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play
incredible roles in this movie that has changed the way we view
cinematic movies. This is no pretty boy Brad Pitt either; it is merely
another amazing job as an actor that he has done in over a decade.
David Fincher did an excellent job in directing and brings us through
the lead characters highs and lows and the ability to truly feel
empathy for him.<br /><br />After viewing this movie it quickly became in my top movies, and
several years later I still enjoy it as the first day that I saw it
which assures me it is 1 of my favourites in the past decade. It is
smart, insightful, and not only touches on the social economics of
humanities own discrepancies but shows us how psychologically tender
and lost our minds can truly be.<br /><br />If you have a fragile cookie dough view of the world, watch this movie
and you&#x27;ll come out carved out of wood and see some of what is wrong
with this world today.<br /><br />10/10 ~XTC
