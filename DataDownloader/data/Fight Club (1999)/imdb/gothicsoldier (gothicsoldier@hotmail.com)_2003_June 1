I found Fight Club to be, in my opinion, the best movie ever.<br /><br />The antisocial ideals and thoughts seem to be perfectly astute for our
times.<br /><br />This movie displays the truthes that face our society. Our lives have
become
opressed and isolated because public concern and political correctness. A
lack of modern gumption that drives all of the old fashioned American
dreams
into lazy, indifferent, aloof lives that seem subordinate compared to what
they could be.<br /><br />Meanwhile, sterile living and corporate intervention cause us to be
materialistic, and bland. We get all these things without going out and
doing much; just putting some paperwork in order to get a paycheck. Any
physical work would be done only in a small job. There is no manly or
feminine work anymore. The world has become neutered.<br /><br />This film's intention is to alienate this fact and hope to get a message
across for it.<br /><br />Fight Club was a genious, antisocial, wonderful film. It deserves to be
number one on the top two-hundred fifty.
