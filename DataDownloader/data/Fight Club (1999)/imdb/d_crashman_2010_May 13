I just finished watching this superb piece of art on my computer. I
feel a bit weird, still shocked of what i have just watched. Absolutely
incredible movie, superb casting, and never-before-seen/heard story,
Brilliant! So many things to talk about, yet so very few words there
are to describe this, this... chapter of a lifetime. This is a must see
for any human, tho rated R for the strong language, sex scenes and
other, it delivers a strong message at the same time. At beginning the
movie seems very unclear, it will be hard to understand it, some of you
may even quit watching it, but pleas, do yourself a favor and watch it
until the end. Thank you David Fincher, for another great movie of
yours, thank you!
