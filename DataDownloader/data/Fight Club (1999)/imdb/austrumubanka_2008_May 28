2008_May 28 
almost 10 years have passed and I have not seen better movie than this.
Many people are mistaken when they think that this film is all about
fighting and nothing more. The truth is that it contains the most
interesting and useful moral as you can learn in any other movie. In a
few words the moral is that a man can obtain freedom (and therefore
happiness) only when he/she has given up his needs and fears, that most
of us are living according to society standards, living according to
the style that we hate and in front of which we are actually made
ourselves dependant. I have seen it more than 10 times and always
noticed new ideas which are worth to think about, and most of viewers,
who watch this movie many times, have said that they experience the
same experience. I have also read Fight Club book and honestly and
liked the movie better - this doesn&#39;t happen often - David Fincher did
excellent job - the film has very unique and accordant style without
exaggerations and the crew was very successfully build, actor play is
faultless, there is nothing you would want to change.
