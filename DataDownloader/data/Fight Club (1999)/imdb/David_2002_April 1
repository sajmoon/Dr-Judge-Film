The early stages of David Fincher's Fight Club make great promise to a movie
that deserves more than what is unwound. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both
show their acting gumption, but it is lost on a convoluted message around
halfway through and ultimately wasted during an ending that does no less
than insult the viewer's intelligence. I've seen movies featuring giant
bunny rabbits forecasting the end of the world that have more relevant
things to say than what's presented here.<br /><br />Grade A for those that are able to have nonsensical plot threads, piled in a
messy heap, served to them with a shovel. Watch the first half hour and turn
it off.
