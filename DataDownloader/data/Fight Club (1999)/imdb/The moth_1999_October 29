1999_October 29 

A masterpiece. A 100% truly original, challenging movie about being male in
the 90's. As close to a perfect movie as you can get.
A movie that grabs a hold of you and sits with you for days never letting
go. Director David Fincher unscrews your head and scrambles your brain with
his jawdropping visuals. As funny as it is dark and thoughtprovoking. Brad
Pitt's best performance to date. If there was any fairness in the world he
should get an oscar for this, but he probably won't. Edward Norton is god in
this movie and I'll never see a costume drama with Helena Bonham Carter
again. There's just too much to recommend in this movie. Too much quality to
describe in words. Best movie of the last decade. See it or forever remain
in the dark recesses of the unenlightened.
