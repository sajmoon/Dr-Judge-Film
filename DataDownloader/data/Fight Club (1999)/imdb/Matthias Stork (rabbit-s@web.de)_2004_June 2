&#132;After you've lost everything you are free to do anything.' Listening
to Brad Pitt delivering this remarkable line in a world in which the
people are nothing more than consummers, you really see that Fight Club
is different from other movies. The idea of luxury and a happy , calm
life being a bad thing really shows that the film criticizes our
society and the media. But why would anyone give up wealth security and
&#132;television'? What is the reason for going back in the development of
humanity? And why is this life more fulfilling than everything else?
Fight Club has all the answers to these questions. It is a dark,
exciting, disturbing, frightening but also wonderful near life
experience. It deals with a lot of problems in our society, the
important one being the fact that the people forgot what it is like to
be human. Fight Club shows what living means. It shows how people can
change their lifes but it also knows that there are consequences that
can be either good or bad. It is as much a thriller as it is a black
comedy. Real life means surviving in a world that has forgotten what
the words &#132;real' and &#132;human' mean. Real life means fighting and
standing up for yourself even though you are alone. David Fincher
slowly builds the foundation of this film introducing Edward Norton's
character who is a victim of the new, unnatural world and who is saved
by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a man who wants to go back to the old
world, a man who wants to hit rock bottom. The performances by Norton
and Pitt are amazing. They both deserve an academy award. Pitt gives
his the best performance in his career creating a powerful,
charismatic, wild, crazy but also human character. Norton's portrayal
of the narrator cannot be described in words since it is one of the
best performances ever seen on film. The director David Fincher proved
once again that he is a perfect storyteller creating tension and
emotions in a dark atmosphere. His direction slowly leads the audience
to the point where they have to make a choice. Are they consummers or
real human beings? 10\10
