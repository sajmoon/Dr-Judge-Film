I saw Fight Club for the first on HBO now knowing what to expect. The
movie
ended and I was scroling through the TV guide to find out when it would be
on HBO next. It was that good. Everything was phenomonal, acting, story,
THE
SUPRISE ENDING! I won't tell anything spescific, but the suprise in the
end
makes the movie even better to watch the second time. Just like in the
Sixth
Sense, the movie leaves clues behind, and looking back and spotting them
was
the most fun I'd had watching a movie in a long time. Do yourself a favor,
see this movie, and when it's done... watch it again. It's worth every
second of your time.
