Once again the public have chosen to ignore a great film,maybe it's me maybe
I'm somekind of jinx because every (well there are exceptions) one of my
favourate films is either panned by the critics, ignored by the public or
both.<br /><br />Fight Club is a film which is good on so many level's I can't even begin to
fathom how it won not ONE oscar when in all honesty it deserved every single
one applicable.<br /><br />David Fincher is without a doubt one of the best directors in Hollywood
today, every film he has made (bar Alien 3) has been a masterpiece. From the
opening shot (following the camera from the interior of a human brain
through to the gun barrel in Ed Norton's mouth) you know your going to be in
for something special. The movie moves at such a pace I have to double check
that it was two and a half hours long after my first (of many) viewings, but
don't be put off by the run time this is a film you'll want/have to see
over, and over, and over again.<br /><br />Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are the best they've ever been in their career's.
Just when you thought Norton couldn't improve any more he just keeps getting
better and better, Pitt on the other hand managed to prove that Meet Joe
Black was just a blip on his track record by turning in a charismatic turn
as the No Sh*t taking Tyler Durdin.<br /><br />This is one film you have to see but do not's pick it up if your expecting a
non-stop action film, or you really will be dissapointed. Instead expect to
see a highly intelligent, black comedy that will have you laughing more
times than you'd expect, with some extremely violent scenes thrown in for
good measure <br /><br />5 out of 5
