2005_June 8 
I can't believe I waited this long to see this movie. My husband kept
asking me if I thought he was as sexy as Brad Pitt and I couldn't quit
say yes without cracking up. I have very little to criticize about this
flick, except I know my mother would hate it. I liked it's comments on
crappy low pay jobs and mindless life sucking jobs and soul-killing
ethic suspect jobs related to insurance...who said &quot;you expect me to
hand over my brain for your use for the entire day and expect me to
think it will be returned in an unmutilated condition!?&quot;? Oh yeah it
was Utah Phillips. I think this movie will always be relevant and
gripping and thought inducing...we are all so tied to out jobs and
things and vehicles etc. etc. etc....and for so many of us these ties
are not a good thing and they stop us from seeing beyond out own little
bubbles. Anyway &quot;self improvement is masturbation&quot; is a good line,
although it makes masturbation look bad. As if any of us would have got
through our early years without it. But I agree with the point. I work
in a bookstore, and the richer the person seems, the more likely they
are to buy a self improvement book. (Not a self help book though! Self
improoovment.) anyway watch it, and if you've seen it watch it again.
Just not with your mom.
