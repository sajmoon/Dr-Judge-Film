I cannot believe the number of rabid fans this sophomoric
self-indulgent piece of watered down Nietzsche crossed with Herman
Hesse's Steppenwolf has garnered. If this film was a life-changing
experience for some of the reviewers I am wrung with pity at what that
life must have been before, and with the thought of what it can have
become. <br /><br />There was some amusing satire in here, but you had to wade through a
lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it.<br /><br />I am commenting only because I think this tawdry junker needs a
counterpoint to its unmerited adulation. If you found a lot in this
movie and want to watch it again and again to validate your deep
philosophical and artistic insights, you need to broaden your horizons.
Grow up and join the real world. Ask for more from your art than this.
