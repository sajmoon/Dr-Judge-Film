One of the most thought provoking movies I have seen. It aims to shed
some light on the originators of fascist movements taking root all over
the world. Everywhere someone - some twisted mind - is out there to
take control of emotionally vulnerable people and then channelize it to
their own end. To make the connection with fascism clear, in one of the
memorable scenes Tyler asks its recruits whether they have black
shirts/jackets/etc - recall the Blackshirts of Mussolini URL =
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts . Take the Al-Qaeda, Lashkar
or Hitler, Stalin all seem to have a basic lack of respect for human
life and they all are like Tyler ... the only difference being Tyler (I
mean Norton) tries to redeem himself in the end. Sure as hell we know
rest of the Hitlers and his ilk never knew what they were doing ...<br /><br />And why just fascists ... even religious preachers, communists or just
about anybody who is fanatic enough to convert others to his point of
view with a crusaders zeal (to the point of trying to eliminate people
if they do not convert) all come under the scanner in this brilliant
movie.<br /><br />On a different note, for a long time I was under the impression that
this movie is one of &quot;Fast and furious&quot; varieties ... am happy that
ultimately I overcame my inhibition to see this masterpiece.
