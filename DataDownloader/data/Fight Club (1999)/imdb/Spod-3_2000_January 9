I don't think I've ever been put off a film by its violent content .. until
this one. You come out of it feeling like you've been swimming in a tub full
of offal. After two hours or so it really starts to become boring, which is
disturbing in itself. After it finished though, and I got the more
disgusting images out of my mind somewhat, I thought, it really doesn't make
much sense either - did anyone ever hear of data backups, maybe? and just
how do you wire up a condemned old house for a heap of electronic gismos to
conduct a urban warfare campaign? 
Cronenberg manages all the creepiness and shocking images (e.g. Videodrome)
without stooping to the goriness that this film revels in.
