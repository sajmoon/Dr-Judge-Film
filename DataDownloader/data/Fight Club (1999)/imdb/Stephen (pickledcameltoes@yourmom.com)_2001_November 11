I  wish I saw this in theaters but I didn't because I thought<br /><br />everything the movie had going for itself was shown on the<br /><br />previews.  Don't get me wrong, the trailer was well done and I<br /><br />enjoyed it.  I just couldn't see myself sitting through a movie<br /><br />containing nothing but the content seen in the previews.  More than<br /><br />meets the eye my friend.
