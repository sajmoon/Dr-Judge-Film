WOW! One of the best movies I have seen. It leaves you re-living the whole
movie in your mind. Graphic violence? Yes but totally in the context of the
movie. You have to see this with friends just to have some one to talk
about
it afterwards. (Perhaps not the best first date movie though) If you
enjoyed
&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; you'll love this one, since it's more a social
commentary. Unfortunatley too many people will take this movie too
seriously. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
