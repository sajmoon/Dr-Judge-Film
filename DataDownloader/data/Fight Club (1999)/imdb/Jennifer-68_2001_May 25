When I first saw a preview for Fight Club, I thought, &quot;Hmm, another
testosterone-filled, gratuitously violent movie.  Next.&quot;  I had no desire
to
see it whatsoever.  One of my friends begged me to see it.  I was VERY
skeptical, but I watched it just so she would shut up about it.  To my
extreme surprise, I was drawn in within the first minute and had my jaw
hanging up to the very end.<br /><br />Now, even my friend who recommended it to me wishes I would shut up about
this movie.  I have to admit - I'm obsessed.  This movie is one of the
greatest films about current society (right next to Traffic).  Fight Club
is
not about testosterone.  It isn't even really about the fighting.  It's
about dissatisfaction with modern society.  It's about what happens when
people become too technologically dependent.  It's about an anger that most
Generation-Xers feel and never had a name for.<br /><br />Many people think this movie is insulting to intelligent people.  As one of
the top ten from my graduating class, I strongly disagree.  One of my
fellow
honors graduates is equally obsessed with this movie and actually had done
some of things that are in the movie before the movie ever came out.  I
understood all of the characters in this movie because they are people that
I see every day.<br /><br />Others find the movie overly violent, saying it inspires children to be
violent towards others.  I've had personal experience from up to ten years
ago (3rd or 4th grade for me) to show me that violence at school is nothing
new; it just has everyone's attention now.  That aside, the violence toward
other humans portrayed in Fight Club shows how desensitized our generation
is to violence.  Some people rationalize the violence as a desire for
attention.  I really think it is.  As the narrator (Edward Norton) says,
&quot;Would you rather be God's worst enemy or nothing?....At least this way
he'll know our name.&quot;<br /><br />Just like the teens in Traffic, this current generation is intelligent but
bored.  There is no war or economic crisis.  There is nothing to rebel
against.  So they rebel against the norm and eventually are left fighting
their own selves.<br /><br />Why do I love this movie?  Because it's blatantly honest and real.  It
answers no questions; it only states the problems.  Fight Club, whether you
accept it or not, is the perfect demonstration of what Generation-X is all
about.  Shocking?  It should be.  Disturbing?  Absolutely.  Fight Club
should be a big wake-up call to everyone.  The comfy &quot;normal&quot; people should
be alarmed; the 'Tyler Durdens' should be thrilled to see others feel the
same way; and everyone should be wanting to do something about this
lifestyle.  This film is important to society.  Ignore all of the bashing
about this movie and WATCH FIGHT CLUB.
