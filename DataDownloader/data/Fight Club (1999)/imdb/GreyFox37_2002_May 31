oh...my...god...i just recently saw this. one word sums it up, unbelievable.
this movie is what i have been waiting for since the 1976 classic, Network.
ok, if you're female, you might not like it, but if you do, good for you!
you obviously have some good taste and are willing to try out something new.
anyway, fight club has some of the most fantastic psychological elements i
have EVER seen. the lines are amazing, the acting is perfect, and the story
has so many twists and turns, you'll be spinning in your chair, hehe. this
movie made realize a few things we take for granted in life, and freaked the
hell out of my roomate, heh. this is the movie to see if you love mind
trips!
