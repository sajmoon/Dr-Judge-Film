This movie was weird. It tripped me out, at first watching it i thought oh
two characters opening a fight club. Then when i realized it was Edward
Norton who was the narrator was being the Tyler guy two. It was weired but i
got it. I was very good. Edward Norton is far by the best New Actor these
days. I give this movie ten out of ten. I also recommend seeing American
History X with Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
