The violence and filming methods made this movie the most disturbing.  I
enjoy a good violent film every now and then, but this movie left me with
a
bad taste in my mouth and a sick feeling in my stomach.  Took me 2 hours
to
finally drift into an uneasy sleep.  DEFINITELY not one that I would see
again...for sure not letting my 16 year old watch it.
The only redeeming quality of the film was the twist at the
end.
