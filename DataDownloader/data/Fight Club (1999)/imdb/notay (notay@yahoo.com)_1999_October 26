1999_October 26 

This film is NOT the best of the decade, people  (Note Schindler's List,
Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption), but it is really darn good.  The
visuals are the best depiction of surreal, gritty darkness since Dark City.
The acting is superlative for both Norton and Pitt.  Both HAVE done better
work (American History X &amp; 12 Monkeys, respectively), but each is energetic
and very believable in their roles.  I could have done without Helena
Bonham
Carter completely, though it was exciting to see her playing against
Edwardian type...  The Dust Brothers soundtrack works very nicely.<br /><br />To dispell a myth, this movie is NOT the most ultraviolent ever.  The
homosexual rape of Pulp Fiction, the surreal psycho-sexual assaults and
torture of Clockwork Orange and of course the martial carnage of Saving
Pvt.
Ryan all exceed the batterings of Fight Club, in both graphic detail and
the
overall ability to disturb the viewer.<br /><br />The &quot;twist&quot; at the end of the film is sort of old hat material to anyone
with any sort of experience with philosophy (read Descartes, Twain's
&quot;Mysterious Stranger,&quot; or even watch the Matrix), but is nonetheless quite
unpredictable.  The rebellion against corporate cubicle-generated
consumeristic furniture catalogue materialism springs from the same
frustration that fueled Falling Down and even Dilbert comics.  This is just
far more visceral.<br /><br />A great film of the 90's and worth seeing for anyone 18-30 who has by this
time become quite innured to cinematic violence.  :)
