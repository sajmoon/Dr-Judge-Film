A movie about enlightenment, discovering and using the primal power
within, and making your life better, not by building up what you don&#39;t
have, but by destroying the things in your life that do not truly
matter. Fight Club also has very clever humor, and a decent love story
that won&#39;t make you cry but won&#39;t make you laugh either. Fight Club
discusses the hidden harm caused by consumerism and being a slave to a
market-based society. Not only a great movie, but therapeutic to many
who feel trapped by the unnecessary rules and standards of their
society. This movie is a wake up call for anyone and everyone out there
who works a job they hate so they can buy sh*t they don&#39;t need.
