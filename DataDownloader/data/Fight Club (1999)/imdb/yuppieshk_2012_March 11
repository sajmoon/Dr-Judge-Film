I think the movie is worth 2 or 3 at most.<br /><br />What the whole movie really brought to the viewers is a mass of
violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity.<br /><br />I am not going to describe the violence and destruction here because
everyone can easily understand what I am talking about. These things
are obvious. I want to point out the latter three.<br /><br />First, if a person don&#x27;t know how to create explosives, how come after
becoming a psycho he/she can? ...illogical and impossible. Second,
without Brad Pitt, how could a fight club exist? ...illogical. Third,
what did the other members of the fight club do to earn a living? They
appeared as jobless or tramps. ...impossible and obscure. Actually
there are other points I am tired of pointing out.<br /><br />If all these things are good in our world, what is the bad? As a
result, it was not awarded any prize.
