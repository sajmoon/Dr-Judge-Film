modern day clockwork orange.  excellent film.  i think Fincher is a
genius.
great performances by norton and pitt.  i love the plot.  i love
everything
about this film.  it's absolutely brilliant.  the way the story is told is
awesome.  i love how when you watch it again you can see all the hints for
the big plot twist that comes later... and what a plot twist it is.  i
won't
give it away for those who may not have seen this movie yet.  and no this
film is not about punching each other in the face.  it's about so much.
there are no easy answers given - because there are none.<br /><br />
