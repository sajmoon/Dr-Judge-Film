This is movie is a great action movie, because it is, despite the constant
brutal violence, not really the typical action movie.  It is very original,
and is a great study of a protagonist with schizophrenia.
This movie IS realistic.  People with schizophrenia (I know this because
both my parents are shrinks) often feel the need to beat themselves and
other things to a pulp because of the emptiness they feel.<br /><br />This movie is tricksy in the way that A Beautiful Mind was tricksy, and I
like movies that turn the tables like this.<br /><br />Fight Club is entertaining and is a rare great action flick.  It's also
based on a great book, I hear (which I should have read beforehand), so I
suppose that helps.<br /><br />Chaw.  Bloody Brilliant.
