I've watched &quot;Fight Club&quot; many times.Yes,it is disturbing and yes,it is
violent.But,it does deliver a legitimate message.I've read that a man's
first fight is comparable to a woman's first sexual experience,he never
forgets it.Every man,whether he wants to admit it or not,in his deepest
darkest area of his mind wonders how he will stand up in a fight.A
fight frees a man in a way nothing else does.It doesn't matter if he
wins or loses.All that matters is that he makes a stand.That's why
bullies pick fights with people who don't fight back.A woman can run
from a fight and nothing bad is said about her,but,when a man runs he's
labeled a coward and looked down on.Men are born to fight,whether it's
in a physical fist fight or in a courtroom or a boardroom we fight.And
face it,WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.Now,I'm not saying we should go out and
form Fight Clubs and start beating each other up,but if you are a man
reading this and have never been in a fight I do suggest you take some
boxing or kick boxing lessons,put on the gloves and climb into the ring
at least once.Then you can judge if this movie has anything valid to
offer.
