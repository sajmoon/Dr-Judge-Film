Yes, i just quoted Limp Bizkit. But it's all true! I love this movie! At
first it just seemed like a movie about stupid (but hot) guys fighting in an
underground club. But when I watched it, I found that it had an intricate
and messed up plot. Ed Norton is my favorite actor, and this movie rates him
even higher!  Now
that is quality cinema.
