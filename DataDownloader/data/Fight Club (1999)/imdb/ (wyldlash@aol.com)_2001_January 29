I am a fool.<br /><br />I saw the ads for Fight Club back in 1999 and thought it looked like
doo-doo.  Spoiled actors beating each other up and then philosophizing
about
it; kind of like those Pokemon movies where they fight and fight and fight
for 65 minutes, then spend the last three deciding that fighting is wrong.
Ick.  Pass.<br /><br />When the reviews came out, the ones I saw were uniformly negative -- just
as
I expected -- and I didn't go and didn't think much more about
it.<br /><br />But when the DVD came out with that insanely elaborate and voluminous
packaging, I was caught up short.  Why would they bother?  How much is
there
to say about this thing?<br /><br />On a whim (and with a Christmas gift certificate) I bought it, expecting
to
hate the movie, but eager to see how many extras they could cram onto a
DVD.
Or two.<br /><br />And that's when I realized what a fool I was to trust advertising and
critical reaction to make a decision for me.  Because this is the funniest
movie I've seen in ages.  That's right, funny.  As in laughing.<br /><br />Of course the ad department tried to sell the violence.  That's what they
know.  How do you sell jokes about cancer survivor groups and cultural
terrorism?  Much easier to show people beating each other
up.<br /><br />Of course the critics didn't get the jokes.  Stodgy middle-aged types with
cushy, irrelevant jobs like reviewing movies.  Laughing at this would be
admitting they live in a house of cards.<br /><br />But the fact is, this is vicious, biting and hilarious comedy.  As with
all
great comedy, there are no answers, only a finger pointing at the
insanity.
What is the answer to the evolutionary and economic corner we've backed
ourselves as a species into?  Every conceivable response is
madness.<br /><br />I was a fool for listening to the ads and the critics.  Almost cost me one
of the best movie experiences I ever had.
