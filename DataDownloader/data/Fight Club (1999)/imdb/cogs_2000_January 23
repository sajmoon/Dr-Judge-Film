It is difficult to talk about Fight Club without giving away crucial
information so it is better to concentrate on the film's formal aspects.<br /><br />With that said Fincher's film is formally the most interesting film out of
Hollywood in years. It is productive to align it with John Boorman's
&quot;Point
Blank&quot; which also challenged the veracity of the image and that of the
narrator/protagonist. It is nice to see that some of Hollywood's elite are
still willing to be involved in intelligent cinema, even if it damages
their
marquee value.
Finally to those who have seen the film and are going to see it again pay
close attention to the first 30 minutes for the subliminal insertion of
the
image of Pitt's character. Fincher's film is full of all these details
that
are entirely significant without being excessively stylistic.
