This film is sheer brilliance.  It's got everything a great film should
have: stunning cinematography, great characters, powerful directing, a
plot
that twists and turns and leaves you guessing, plus more than I could ever
put in this review.<br /><br />This film is for men and about men.  It portrays the deep angst men feel,
as
well as how to be a 'real' man.  Tyler Durden sums it all up while sitting
in the bathtub drinking a beer when he says, &quot;My old man never went to
college, so it was real important that I go.  So I went to college and got
my degree.  After graduation I called my old man and said, 'Dad, what
should
I do now?'  He said, 'get a job.'  So I went out and got a job.  Then I
made
my annual call, and asked, 'Dad, what should I do now?'  He said, 'I don't
know, get married?'  We are a generation of men raised by women.  Somehow
I
wonder if another woman is really the answer we need?&quot;<br /><br />A stunning observation that hits almost any man in the head with full
force.
We are a generation of feminized men who were raised by women.  The
generations that came before us were raised by our fathers, and this has
somehow become lost in our society.  Fight Club provides the male legacy
that existed on this planet for thousands and thousands of years before
our
current generation.  As Durden observes, the answers we seek as men will
never come from women, but from other men.<br /><br />If you are a man under the age of 40 and have not seen this film, it is
your
moral imperative to rent it and watch it immediately.  And after you've
seen
it, get together with the guys and throw a few punches of your
own!
