1999_December 16 
<br /><br />This is not a movie that would have normally raised any interest in me.
However, when The Fight Club first arrived in Spain, the reviews and
critiques that it received in the press where extremely negative, perhaps
the worst critiques i have ever heard towards a movie. This raised my
curiosity substantially, and after watching the movie, I did agree with
some
of the things the critics had warned about.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I must say that the movie begins impressively, the
analytical
depiction of our western culture and the lifeless void that surrounds it,
with some great touches of humour, is very impressive. One cannot help but
to relate to the movie, because the emptiness under which Edward Norton's
character lives is something that most people in our modern day societies
can really identify with; it depicts a society in which materialism and
consumerism are our only sources of pleasure, from which we get
short-lived
doses of excitement delivered from our material purchases. The director
managed to display the most average man who had a normal job, flat,
decoration, etc, someone who we could see as our equal, someone on our
level. The familiarity one feels towards him should really be disturbing,
yet it is not, mainly because after a re-count, he is a normal,
integrated,
productive member of our western society. He is what is hoped for and
expected from all of us.<br /><br />The sad thing is that the director who started a movie, which I (up to
that
point) would have awarded 10 of 10, ended up delivering a movie, which I
rated with a 4 of 10. The beginning is excellent, but half an hour into
the
movie or so, it is as if the director had introduced a completely
different
movie. From that point on it goes from bad to worse, and turning into
another typical mindless Hollywood movie, with an unnecessary level of
violence and a storyline which deteriorated by the minute and a
precipitated
ending that delivered nothing and just fouled those magnificent initial 30
minutes.
