2000_February 13 

First of all...I truly hated it and yet liked it. Okay, I know you are
wondering what kind of rating is that, but it is true. While I hated the
film for it's violent content, I liked the quality of the story and the
outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.
Any film that makes &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; look like a Disney movie is a
film that is truly not for everyone. My immediate reaction after seeing
this
film was that I would not encourage anyone to see this film, nor would I
even want to review it for fear that it might spark someone to want to see
it. I don't think I have ever seen a more violent movie nor do I ever want
to see one. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is truly in a class by itself. It is a film that
you would not want to take a date to, nor is it a film that will entertain
you...I can't imagine someone running down to the local Blockbuster and
picking it up for a quiet evening at home. I am not one for censorship nor
am I one for banning a film, but I would seriously question the judgement
of
someone who viewed this film and considered it entertainment. The story
centers around the relationship of two people, Pitt and Norton, and the
enjoyment they get from beating the &quot;heck&quot; out of each other. They fight
not
for sport, but for the pure enjoyment they feel from the pain they inflict
upon others and in return have inflicted upon them. Bottom line...I feel
it's time we add another rating to our rating scale...&quot;NRQ&quot;...&quot;No Redeeming
Quality&quot;. This film has no redeeming qualities, is not entertaining, nor
should anyone see it...but it definitely is one film like no
other.
