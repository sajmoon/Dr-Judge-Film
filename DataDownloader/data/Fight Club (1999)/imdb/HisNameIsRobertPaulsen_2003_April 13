This is an excellent movie, even though many people never understood what
it
was about, and many thought that it was a pointless action
movie.<br /><br />What makes this movie excellent is that it's not an action movie per se,
but
more of a psychological and philosophical journey into the mind of every
male bored and tired of their own lives. You know who I'm talking about,
the
ones that are stuck in dead-end jobs, stuck with a commanding wife that
treats 'em like dirt and want something better, and the ones that are
alone
with no one in sight to comfort them.<br /><br />The material things do not help 'em feel better and that's why the
narrator
feels like he does...until he meets Tyler Durden<br /><br />The fights in fight club only help release all the male rage inside.
which
would help most of us.<br /><br />If there are chick flicks, well now you can say there is a dude
flick.<br /><br />(I know all these comments have been posted before, but this is MY first
