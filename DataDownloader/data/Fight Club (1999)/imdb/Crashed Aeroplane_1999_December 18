WOW.
Rather impressive this one. Why?
It has the black humour of a Tarantino.(ok don't laugh)
the style of Scorsese.
And the brains of Fincher.(Well obviously)
Form the minute that wierd going through Edward Norton's head thing starts
with the Dust Brothers destroying brain cells at at 120 bpm it gets
good.
Genuinely Smart. Chillingly disturbing. And horribly funny.
Now correct me if I'm wrong but this is all you need for a &quot;Best Picture&quot;
award.
