I thought Fight Club was a fantastic movie. I put off watching it for a
long
time because I hadn't heard anything about it and figured it was some
stupid
boxing movie.<br /><br />Boy was I in for a shock...<br /><br />Fight Club is not about violence. Fight Club is not about boxing. Fight
Club
is about ideas. About the ideas that kill the mind and the spirit. About
the
ideas that can change a person from a puppet to a creation of their own
universe.<br /><br />Watch it. If you don't get it, watch it again. Open your mind and consider
that there is something in this film that is speaking to you, listen hard,
hear it. You won't be sorry.
