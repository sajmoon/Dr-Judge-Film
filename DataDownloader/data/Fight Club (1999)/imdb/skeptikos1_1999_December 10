1999_December 10 

This film could have been so much stronger, but it sacrifices whatever power
it had as a social commentary in the last half hour with a &quot;twist&quot; ending
that seems completely out of place... there were weaknesses early on (the
dialogue and narration is a bit precious, and the entire film has a slick,
music-video quality that contradicts its criticism of consumer culture), but
I could forgive its early faults and focus instead on its good points-- the
jabs at yuppiedom, media images of masculinity, etc. It wasn't perfect, but
I was enjoying it... and then it just tanked. The last act is idiotic in
itself-- but it doesn't stop there, it reduces the rest of the film to a
worn-out joke.  The climax literally took me out of the story. A missed
opportunity.
