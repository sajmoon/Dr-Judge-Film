I have just seen this movie and I do not really know what this movie is
all about! Is it the fashionable &quot;easy-mindedness&quot; which awaits the
hero at the end of the rabbit's hole as a final finding about how life
should be lived? Is it the invention of violence as a healing therapy
which would be infantile and motivating to crime? Or is it a
fashionable exposition of a schizophrenic attitude which finds his
answer in losing the point? There is not a clue given to help us
decide. I have rarely seen such a mess as this one. There are more and
more topics from under the pen of modern authors the contents of which
are contradictory and nonsensical. This trend seems to have begun by
the admired &quot;Terminator&quot; and its like the topic of which, its rational
and real possibility, is off line. So what is left to the viewers are
mere pictures and a waisted time of about two hours.
