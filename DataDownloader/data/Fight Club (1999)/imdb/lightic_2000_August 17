I believe that the only reason for a person not to like this piece of art
is
simply because he or she doesn't understand it!<br /><br />If you do, you'll discover top-end acting from the great Edward Norton as
well as from the excellent Brad Pitt. The latest filming technology,
including &quot;bullet-time&quot;-filming. The director is literally 'telling the
story' in a way so that you can't miss anything. Presumably, you will miss
things anyway. But not as much as in other difficult movies...<br /><br />Furthermore is the story very deep and mind-dazzling! You can't predict
what
is going to happen and that is great! I love that kind of film!<br /><br />If you have complains about the fights... Don't bother. See through them.
The fights has a submerged meaning, a purpose... Can you guess what it is?<br /><br />One more thing: I WANT TO WATCH IT AGAIN! and I'm gonna...!
