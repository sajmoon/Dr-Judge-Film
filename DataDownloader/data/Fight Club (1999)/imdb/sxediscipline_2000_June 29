Pure genius, apocalyptic, and brilliant.  David Fincher succeeds yet again
with another amazing movie, and better than his previous two, and combining
both is some aspects.  He takes the darkness of The Game, and the erie
feeling of Seven, and puts them both into Fight Club, and of course, comes
out with yet another vibrant film. <br /><br />Fight Club shows the world what we all want to be.  It shows the sides that
we don't want to see, that society cannot grasp in public, but dreams about
when they are alone.  It depicts the life we wish we had.  Simple, violent,
and anarchistict(heh).   This movie repels the people who criticize it.  All
the ones who look at it as just violence, and only that.  Chuck Palahinuk
has written one of the best novels(which is also exceptionally good).  Pitt
puts on the best performance of his career since 12 Monkeys.  Norton shows
us that he is made out for people like &quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;Derek Vinyard&quot;(American
History X) and not people like &quot;father Brian Finn&quot;(Keeping the Faith).<br /><br />It was a shame that this movie was so underrated, because it really shows
great movie making, and it shows us reality(in a sense).  All put aside,
this filming in this movie is beautiful, dark and suspenseful.  David
Fincher has put out one of the best, a real movie that shows what everyone
wants to be.  Fight Club IS what it is, it is not the Academy Awards, it
isn't what you want it to be, it is what we are afraid to be.  Go see this
movie.  ***** out of *****
