1999_October 22 

Once in a while, a film comes along which changes the way we look at
ourselves, our society and our lives. This is that film.<br /><br />This film is not about a group of men getting together to get the c**p
beaten out of them. This is not a film about sex and violence. This is a
film about the very fabric of our lives today. I am in my mid 20's and I
very seriously identified with the main character, although I've been told
his name's not Jack. His desire to make more money, to fill his apartment up
with &quot;things&quot;, his feeling that there is something missing from his life. I
can identify with all of these.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to ANYONE. It will give you a real
insight into the way that the world is evolving around you.
