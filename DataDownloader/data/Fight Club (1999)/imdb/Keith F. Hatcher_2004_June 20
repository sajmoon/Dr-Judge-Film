<br /><br />Though this film does not work for me. A film based on violence does not
appease me. Edward Norton excellent, Brad Pitt more or less suffrable, and
Helena Bonham-Carter totally miscast. I wish she would come back to real
films made in the UK. She seems to have been stuck into this one rather as a
decorative piece, a bit of girl in an overstretched `macho' display, which,
ultimately, does not convince. It is that embedded American tendency to go
over the top in exaggerated play-offs, whether action or dialogue, that is
so off-putting.
If you like seeing people go off the rails, if you like to see naked
debauchery, here you have it.
