This movie has it all.  Most people agree.  It's probably my favorite film
of all time. The people who don't like it because it's too insane or sick,
go watch some Disney movies.  This movie flows perfect, sure it has some
mistakes, what movie doesn't?  This one however doesn't need to hide, its
perfect.  The ideas, stories, branching ways, characters, moods,
appearance
is perfect. I watched it so many times, just to get it out, Lou! 100 out
of
10!!!!
