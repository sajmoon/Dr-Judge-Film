2006_April 5 
In my opinion the greatest film of all time. It defines a generation
while giving hope to those coming after smashing their world with every
word out of Tyler&#39;s mouth. Disturbingly beautiful, magnificently
directed and the greatest performance of Pitt, and possibly Nortan (if
not in American History X). Do not miss this powerful, gorgeous,
incredible film. It makes you laugh, smile, grimace, cry, and stare
mouth agape at the sheer magnitude of what you are witnessing before
you. Carter does a wonderful job as the love interest. There are
certain scenes which can only be described as magic. They are some of
the greatest revelations and conversations ever captured. You simply
must watch it, and then watch it again because you know you want to!
