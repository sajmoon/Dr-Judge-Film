Viewing this film is like making love for the first time. You think you
know
what is happening but until you have experienced it a few times you just
don't get it.<br /><br />Just exactly what are we and where do we stand in the world? Are we living
or are we plugged in to a machine that is draining us dry? This Quentin
Tarantino film asks some psychological questions and hints at political
reasons for the nature of humanity today.<br /><br />Have you reached bottom yet? Maybe this film will help.<br /><br />If you did not give the film a 10 and you watched it only once I can see
your true nature, you would have made a great Munich cheerleader in
1938.<br /><br />This is the strongest social commentary I have seen in a decade.<br /><br />My hat is off to you Quentin, this is an amazing piece of work. Great
acting
and a story with a twist so staggering that I watched whole thing over the
same night.
