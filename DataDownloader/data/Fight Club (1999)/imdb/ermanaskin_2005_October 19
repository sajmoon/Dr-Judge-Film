The collapse of the financial world. Excellent. The best movie i have
ever seen. Unfortunately, it was released with the debut of Matrix,The.
It was a very very big mistake for a producer to release a movie at
that time. If it hadn't come to the market at that time, it would have
been more successful. From beginning to end the characters, roles,
story etc. all the things are in balance in this movie. I have watched
it several times (i don't remember probably 50-55) and if somebody
comes to me and says let's watch this movie, i can watch it one more
time. I send my congratulations to all the staff of Fight Club. I wish
all the films in the market were like that but i know most of them
aren't. :))))
