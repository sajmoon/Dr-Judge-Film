2003_August 26 

This film is one of the greatest films of the last ten
years.
It has wit, shock, confusion and a style, all polished, wonderfully
played
and superb to watch.  This could be a David Lynch film but this makes far
more sense....just!  Watch this over and over again to see the wonderful
storyline and just watch it for its in-house jokes.  A film like this
won't
come along for a long time.  [Must see!]
