When I first saw Fight Club I was 11 years old, and after seeing it at
that age I thought it sucked, mainly due to confusing story, and me not
being English I couldn&#39;t really make much out of it, hence the hateful
attitude I got for the movie.<br /><br />However, after seeing it again several years later, and then once more
when I&#39;m 18, I first noticed what a true masterpiece this movie is.
Norton and Pitt simply ace their roles by far, and show that they both
are world class actors.<br /><br />Not all credit goes to them, as the movie is very good by itself, and
the great acting only boosts the score. It&#39;s masterpiece, and one of
the absolutely best movies in the world, ever, seriously.<br /><br />Honestly I cannot understand why Fight Club 2 hasn&#39;t come out, but then
again, it might destroy the first one because it&#39;s that good, and I
don&#39;t think the producer would want that, and it&#39;d most likely take a
lot to get to those standards set.<br /><br />If you want to see Norton and Pitt at their best when it comes to their
acting skills, then look no further, this is it.
