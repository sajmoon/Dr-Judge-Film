I didn't know what to make of the film before I saw it. It looked cool, but
Brad Pitt was in it and his acting usually is, well, wooden at
best.<br /><br />Then I saw it.<br /><br />I gotta say, this is a great film. It's got everything: action,
plot,crazies, bombs, acting. Even Brad Pitt puts in a good performance. Made
me respect him as the pretty boy actor he is instead some guy who just looks
good to all the chicks in the land. <br /><br />Ed Norton is the main man, though. He teams up with Pitt to form a club
where beating the living (blank) out of each other is heaven. Every guy who
seems run down and lost in the world and sees it wants to join. Soon they
have a legion of guys at their disposal. that's when Tyler (Pitt) starts to
put into action a series of terrorist actions against the city of Los
Angelos. Meanwhile, Ed Norton's character is getting phased out more and
more as it goes on and he starts to feel left out. From there all heck
breaks loose. <br /><br />With many twists and turns, Fight Club keeps you on your feet and, at least
for myself, Kept me wanting to know more and more what was going to happen.
I've seen this film a dozen times now and it still hasn't lost anything. Go
check it out NOW!!! And remember, the first rule of fight club is :WE do NOT
talk about fight club!!!!ONWARD!!!!
