Fight Club is a very enjoyable movie, but as long as you take it for just
what it is, a psychological thriller with comic elements. Well shot with
very good acting and solid plot. Don't be fooled to think of it as a social
satire or as if there is a strong social message underneath. There might be
something remotely resembling such a thing, but if you simply start to
examine it a bit more seriously, there are more logical holes than a
strainer. I was also a bit annoyed with the female-friendly close shots of
muscles and Brad Pitt, but we'll have to live with this. So thumbs up, but
know what to expect.
