From Director David Fincher( The Game ) is an amazing movie
staring Brad Pitt(The Devils Own ) and Edward Nortan( American History X
).
as always Both actors are amazing.
The movie tells a story of Tyler Durdan who meets Brad Pitt on a plane ,
Something happens to tylers place and he goes to live with Brad Pitt and
they start a Fight Club.
the movie has a huge twist at the end..
A movie to watch... Kinda hard to explain without giving anything away but
watch it and see
