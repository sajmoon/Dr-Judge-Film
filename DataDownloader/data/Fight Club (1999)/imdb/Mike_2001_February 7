Quite simply this was a BAD,BORING and very overrated movie. The story was
terrible,the premise was absurd and the acting was terrible. The movie
went
45 minutes too long and the characters were so unbelievable it was
hilarious. The twist at the end was awesome but by that point you just
don't
care. * out of *****
