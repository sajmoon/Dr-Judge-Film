When I saw the commercials for this and even after my brother said it was a
better film than he thought it would be, it wasn't until he actually rented
it for me that I realized this movie was nothing like its commercials lead
on.
I was expecting a modernized version of the 70's Kung-fu movies, but with
the added &quot;Go out and stomp some schmuck off the streets&quot; message to it.<br /><br />I was not expecting it to be a thought out story where someone took the
time to hide an actually good moral in the entertainment. Tyler's true
intentions are explained when he tells Jack why he sent the convenience
store clerk home.
If you are reading this, you probably already saw it, but if you have not
and are just curious, I say it is definitely worth the time, if you are in
for a multi-layered movie that can mix immediate audio and visual stimulus
as well as a lasting story line that you can scrutinize over for a long
time
to come.  And if not for any of these reasons, there are probably more
&quot;Good&quot; Memorable Quotes in this movie than you could use in a
year.
