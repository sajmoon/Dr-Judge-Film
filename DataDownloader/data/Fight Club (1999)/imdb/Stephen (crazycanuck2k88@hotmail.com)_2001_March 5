Fight Club is a movie that tries its hardest to become a blockbuster
hit.  It almost reaches that acclaimed status, but in my mind just misses
it
because of a sometimes confusing script that tends to boggle the viewer
rather than entertain, and also because of...well I can't seem to find
anything else wrong with it but maybe I will during the course of the
review.<br /><br />The plot, in a very quick summarization, is about 2 men, the Narrator
played by Edward Norton, and Tyler Durde played by Brad Pitt.  For really
no
reason they begin a &quot;fight club&quot; that quickly grows in popularity and
power.
It starts off as a neighbourhood club where guys can come in a release a
little tension, and turns into a nationwide faction of anarchists.  The
plot
flows pretty smoothly, and the storyline is fairly believable.  It is
really
just a movie about Generation Xers standing up to corporate America, but
in
an in your face kind of way.<br /><br />The acting is really well done.  Edward Norton is perfect in his
role.
He's an insomnia stricken yuppy that has a perfect little apartment and a
nice little job.  He starts going to self-help classes because they help
him
sleep, yet still something is lacking in his life and he is not sure what.
Norton really pulls his role off almost easily like he knows his character
from experience.<br /><br />Brad Pitt acts great in his role as the anarchist Tyler Durdon.
However, I felt that I could not take him all that seriously because of
his
pretty boy image.  Half of his scenes were spent with his shirt off which
I
imagine was used to help attract the ladies in this testosterone filled
movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, and yet the ending to me seemed rather tacky
and
used.  Rather like those series finales on tv where the main character
wakes
up and everything was just a dream.  It is kind of a cop out.  However due
to good acting, a solid script/plot, great action sequences, and damn good
directing on the part of David Fincher, Fight Club easily makes up for any
minor flaws it may have.  The first time u view this movie u may feel
rather
lightheaded and confused at some parts, yet it all seems to fit in at the
end.  During multiple viewings, u begin to see the true brilliance in this
film, the cold irony, sadistic humor, metaphors, and issues that are
riddled
throughout the film that you may not have noticed the first time around.
Fight Club can be blatantly extreme, wildly ironic, thought provoking, and
honest all at once.  Few films can claim to be that, Fight Club
can.
