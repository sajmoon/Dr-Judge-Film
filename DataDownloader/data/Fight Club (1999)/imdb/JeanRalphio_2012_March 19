I did not go into watching this movie thinking it would be one of my
new favourite movies of all time. Considering my friend gave me a DVD
rip version of it and I watched it on my laptop whilst mindlessly
stalking people on Facebook. After the first five minutes, I knew it
was like nothing I&#x27;d seen before. Firstly I had turned off Facebook and
decided to actually pay attention instead of just watching enough of it
so I could tell my friend the main plot points and Brad Pitt&#x27;s best
moments.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not what you think it&#x27;s about. If you think you&#x27;re about to watch
a movie similar to &#x27;Never Back Down&#x27; (2008), then you&#x27;re in for some
trouble. &#x27;Fight Club&#x27; had me thinking days after it had finished and it
might even be better watching it the second, third, fourth, or fiftieth
time though.<br /><br />To give you a quick run down it is about a character who is left
unnamed (Edward Norton) and how his life is drastically changed once he
meets Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). I would be giving away too much if I
said much more, but if you enjoy the likes of David Fincher&#x27;s other
work or savour a psychological thriller like &#x27;Black Swan&#x27; or &#x27;American
Psycho&#x27; definitely give &#x27;Fight Club&#x27; a chance because I guarantee you
this is better.
