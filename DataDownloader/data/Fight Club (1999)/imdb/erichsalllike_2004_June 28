Fight Club was one hell of a wild ride. At first, I thought this movie
was another run-of-the-mill Hollywood movie. I was wrong. Dead wrong.
The reason this movie flopped in theaters was the horrible marketing.
It makes it seem like an underground fighting club where you can see
Brad Pitt with his shirt off. Yet it is so much more (Unfortunetly, you
do see Pitt with his shirt off ;) .. This movie throws its ideas in
your face and opens your eyes. I have never had a movie change how I
look at things, however this one does that. You're brought into the
world of a troubled man (Norton) who meets Tyler (Pitt) and changes his
life. From the famous catch line &quot;The first rule of Fight Club is you
don't talk about Fight Club ..&quot; to the mind bending twist, Fight Club
throws your morals out the window and forces you to think and act about
today's society. I recommend you see it. Now.
