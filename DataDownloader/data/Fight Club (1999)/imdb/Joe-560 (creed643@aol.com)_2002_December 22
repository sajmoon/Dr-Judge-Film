Fight Club was, to say the least, one of the best films I've ever seen. I
have and will continue to recommend this movie to anyone, despite the fact
that the average viewer would prefer a mindless, boring, run-of-the-mill
big
action shoot-em-up flick over a provacative, brilliantly scripted and
remarkably choreographed film with deep philosophical origins that
actually
requires use of the brain to comprehend. Critics such as Roger Ebert have
declared this film &quot;pro-fascist&quot;, and I still marvel at such ridiculous
remarks. There are so many brilliant ways to interpret the meanings and
ideals listed in said film and many combinations of viewpoints with which
to
perceive both emotionally and psychologically, as well as physically, that
viewers with shallow-minded ignorance could not even begin to fathom the
awe-inspiring delight and enlightenment that occurs as a result of viewing
it. Most people will be offended for the film's strong celebrations of
violence, but if they don't understand with what purposes the violence has
and what motivations are clearly presented, as well as the overall effect
of
the anti-social behavior that the characters use with which to compromise
their goals, then this film will probably be a waste of time for them.
Others will be put off by the film's attack on modern society and the
basic
foundations of civilization because they listen but do not hear, and it is
ignorance that is a dangerous root in our species. View with an open mind,
a
strong stomach, and most of all pay attention because if you're confused
because you missed something or even worse misunderstood what is being
said,
then you will most likely say you didn't like the film because your
apprehensive skills need work. Brilliant acting, taut script and wonderful
direction, this film is definately a classic cinematic masterpiece that
like
other controversial films will be recognized for what it is as time
progresses.
