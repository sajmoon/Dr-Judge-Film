OK, rules 1+2 of Fight Club may be that we don&#x27;t talk about Fight Club,
but it&#x27;s so good that I just can&#x27;t help it! This is one of those movies
that, once you reach the end the first time, you&#x27;ll be so awestruck
that you just go right back to the start and watch it again, so much so
that this remains my favourite movie of all time.<br /><br />Yes, this is a dark and violent movie, and is certainly not for the
faint hearted, however the violence isn&#x27;t ubiquitous. It would be a
mistake to brush this off as simply a movie about men beating each
other up, that would be to miss Tyler&#x27;s point entirely. It is rather a
poignant social commentary, utilising the violence to get across it&#x27;s
point. There are also lighter and funny moments throughout that provide
contrast with the darker moments and further emphasise them, and to be
honest, the story is so good you just won&#x27;t care about the violence.<br /><br />The acting is also incredible; in my opinion, Norton and Pitt both pull
out the best performances in their careers. Norton&#x27;s Narrator is a
character one can easily empathise with, who Norton exceptionally
portrays as the &#x22;everyday Joe&#x22;, numb to the world and stuck in routine,
until he meets Pitt&#x27;s exceptionally cool Tyler Durden, who the viewer
can&#x27;t help but fall in love with from his first lines and who delivers,
to start with, an interesting philosophy. The scene in which Durden
threatens a check out boy with a gun into significantly altering his
life for the better remains one of my favourite scenes in any movie.<br /><br />Over all this is a masterpiece, every aspect of it clicked my buttons
and I cannot recommend this movie enough to you. Well why are you still
reading this? Go buy it!
