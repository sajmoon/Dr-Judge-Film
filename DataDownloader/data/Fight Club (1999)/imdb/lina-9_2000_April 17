Fight Club  8/10<br /><br /> I had read the book before I saw the film. The book was very interesting
but I can say I will not be a fan of this type of literature. David Fincher
had good idea shooting a film from this book. The plot of the film followed
the book's, and the view was good. But I have enough fantasy to imagine that
is written in the book. I was shocked by each page of the book, yet I went
on reading. The view of the film was not so frightened as I expected (I was
thinking if I wanted to see this movie while I was reading the book), and
there was a few things missed from the film. So the atmosphere, message of
the book was not let in to the light during the film well.<br /><br />But I think the film can impress on somebody: somebody stand up and leave
the movietheatre, somebody think about it.  
The cast was good. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actor, he did a
perfect job here too.He is not muscular, but the force is with him.  He has
charisma. 
I think the reason why Brad Pitt  wanted to do this film that he always
wants audience not to see him like a nice guy. He did OK job, but for me he
will never be Edward Norton.  
Yet I gave seven point to this film, because it is not an average action
film, it has got a deeper message, can made people think, and cast was good.
I think it is worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend it to my parents.<br /><br />
