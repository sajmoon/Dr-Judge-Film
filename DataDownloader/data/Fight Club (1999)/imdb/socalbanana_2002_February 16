most of the people that criticize the movie don't realize that it makes the
fans of the movie love it even more.  in the inlet cards of the DVD, they
print the negative criticisms from (what are ofted called) professional
critics.  that's the marketer's of the DVD's (if not, the directors and
many
other people who took part in making this exceptional film) vision:  &quot;you
are not your movie reviews&quot;.<br /><br />if you thought this movie was dull, than you're odd, because the only thing
dull about this movie was the narrator's boss.<br /><br />and to the people who say the fans of this movie are either similar to the
main characters, or for some reason empathize with them....well you're
exactly right.  there's been way too many times in my life when i wanted to
spray a priest with a water hose.<br /><br />and that's all i have to say about that.
