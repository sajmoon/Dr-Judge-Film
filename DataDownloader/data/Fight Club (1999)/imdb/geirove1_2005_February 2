Besides an excellent and visionary crew and actors, this film has a
very intriguing story and message. The movie explores the importance of
what we as a society has come to cherish. As Brad Pitt and Edward
Norton, who by the way delivers one of their best performances ever,
takes us through a life of different values and social understanding,
we reflect. We see them rebel against our lives and world, we
understand their argument, and it almost comes to a point were we want
their world and reality. On top of this modern philosophical message,
it has a story that will surprise you and trap you to the screen time
after time. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Norton are being &quot;bad asses&quot; all the way,
and as a special little dark bonus, they have thrown in a little sick
and twisted romance for our pleasure, I'm sure. If you haven't seen
this film, sit down and watch a movie that our grandchildren will study
in school as high class culture. If you have seen it, sit down again!
