1999_October 22 

I was looking forward to this since I'm a fan of David Fincher, Brad Pitt,
Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, and since I read and liked the
novel.  For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end.  Not the
plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous
thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays
much better in the movie.  Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair
with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so
forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary.  Still, this is almost
nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented
directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting
story, so you're carried along.  And all three leads are terrific, as is the
supporting cast(including an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto, formerly of
MY SO-CALLED LIFE, going blond here).
