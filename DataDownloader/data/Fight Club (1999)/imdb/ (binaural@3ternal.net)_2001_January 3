I've read a lot of these reviews that people have put on here.  I agree
with
the fact that this movie isn't about a bunch of guys getting together and
beating the snot out of each other.<br /><br />I believe this movie is telling every individual person to stop and think
about what his/her life is, and where it's going.  We need to take a look
at
ourselves and see what our society has become.  We've created this big
corporate America.  The love of money and how we get it is what our lives
revolve around.  It's sad; it really is.  Some people would give their
lives
for money and very often lie, cheat, steal, and kill to get it.  Sure we
need it in society to survive and eat, but all in all it's not that
important.  It doesn't make you happy or put your soul to rest.  Why
should
we be &quot;working jobs we hate so we can buy sh** we don't need&quot;?  Perhaps
that's why Tyler wanted to blow up the credit card companies, to show the
people that the world's not going to end if you can't use your credit
card.
Life goes on with more important things to worry about.  Money is so
interwoven into our society that we really can't live without it, but it
surely isn't everything.  We are no better than the next guy just because
he's poor or lower on the social scale than we are.  As the pearl jam
lyric
states, &quot;You are who, who you are&quot;.<br /><br />One of the main themes of this movie is the concept of hitting bottom.  I
just got done reading a very good book for college, St. Augustine's
Confessions.  One of the things that Augustine addressed was the fact that
we truly can't look at life honestly until we've lost just about
everything
and suffered.  We can't help but to be biased in our opinions when we're
sitting on our own little pedestals happy and content.  When you haven't
suffered hardships, you only see one side of yourself.  How do you know
who
you are when you've only seen one side or yourself.  Hitting bottom, truly
hitting bottom is the only way.<br /><br />This is just one of the issues that Fight Club addresses.  I'm not trying
to
preach here, the last thing i want to do is tell people how to think or
feel.  We should all do that on our own without the opinions of
television,
or anybody for that matter.  One of the main reasons why i wrote this
review
is in reply to &quot;radiofreeadam&quot;.  I hope this helps you in your
understanding
of this movie.  And if you are going to quote from this movie, please
quote
it correctly and don't change the words around to support your argument.
I
encourage you to watch the movie again with an open mind and apply it to
you.
