Fight Club was one of the most ingenious and original films released last
year. Hiding behind a facade of testosterone and  a fascist undertone, Fight
Club is far more complex and layered than that. Edward Norton is perfectly
cast as the Narrator and Brad Pitt as his alter ego Tyler Durden. The
chemistry between the two leads is the most critical aspect of the film, and
it works.Helena Bonham Carter also shines in a role against type.  As for
Fincher's underlying nihilist tone, it  isn't entirely bleak, just look at
the hopeful ending. A sharp blend of action, humor and pathos equalling a
cinematic masterpiece. To quote  the tagline  from American Beauty, &quot;Look
Closer&quot;. <br /><br />There is so much to absorb and understand, this was a cathardic experience
for me.
