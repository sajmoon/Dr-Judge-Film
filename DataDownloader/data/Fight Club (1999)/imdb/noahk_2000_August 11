2000_August 11 

Boy, did I ever hear and read raves about this film, so I had to see it for
myself. Although it succeeded in keeping me interested, I was fairly
disappointed with it. I didn't empathize with a single character, and
somehow I found it very unclear what the appeal of the fight club itself
was. As a result, the cult that builds later in the film seems pretty
absurd
since the basis for it was so poorly explained. What's more, are we as
viewers supposed to be able to identify with Edward Norton's character
because he seems to have some conscience and a hint (however small) of
normalcy?  Not only didn't I understand where he was coming from (until the
end), I didn't really care. I would give this film a score of 5 out of 10,
because it had some good performances (namely Norton) despite not having
much to work with in terms of script, and because it did keep me
interested.
I find it laughable that this film is trying to come off as art,
though..
