Excellent, Excellent, Excellent, Excellent, Excellent
Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Bravo to all who wrote,produced
and directed this movie!! Challenging philosophy exuding from this movie
challenges the viewer to consider other alternatives.  Subjugation of
workers in contrast to non-conformity through madcap/logical/illogical
alternatives,and some dangerous choices(Karl is klapping to the max - or
Marx)....most provoking...asking the viewer,  &quot;come on, think, consider and
wonder at your status quo, and the ones that reduce you, and discover
alternative(s)&quot;.....shades of: &quot;should the strongest,shrewdest or smartest
rule?&quot; (Darwin).... the easiest way to stuff up the revolution against
conformity is to create an organisantion of individuals who make and conform
the set of rules to destroy conformity( Hmmmmmmmm? )  ....join a fight club
and get in touch with your truer self and find a freedom (of some sort) in
non-conformity...discover your latent madness or alter-ego at least....hey,
but don't abide by any rules...... 
Bravo again....10/10
