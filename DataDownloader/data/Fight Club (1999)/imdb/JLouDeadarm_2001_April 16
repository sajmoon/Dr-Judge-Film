2001_April 16 

Although I am only seventeen years of age, I have seen more movies than
almost everyone I know.  I try to watch one every day.  A while ago, I
decided that I need to compile a Top 20 list.  After weeks of serious
thought, Fight Club came out on top.  There is no other movie like it.  I
get a severe case of hurt feelings whenever someone talks badly about this
movie.  All the actors (yes, even Meatloaf) are outstanding.  The violence
can be a bit much for some, but I'm rather desensitized anyway and it does
not bother me.  If you have not yet seen this film, you are truly missing
out on a quality work of art.  Yes, I said &quot;work of art.&quot;  Corny?  Yes.  So
what?  To me, that is what this movie is.  Everything weaves together
perfectly, and each time I watch it I catch something new.  When my friend
gave it to me for my birthday, I ditched everyone at my party and watched it
immediately.  Yes, I admit to being obsessed.  It is simply that I have
never seen such a wonderful, funderful movie.
