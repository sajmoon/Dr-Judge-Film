I got a pretty simple rating system for a good/bad movie. A bad movies
doesn't stay in my head, it just dissolves away without notice. Few movies
stays in my brain for good, they got their own real estate, without asking
me that is.<br /><br />Fight Club is such movie, that sneaked in, grabbing real estate. I knew
nothing about the movie, other than my friends told me it was a 90'
classic.
Already in the beginning, this movie made me focus on it. Like I was going
down a alley, and this man jumps out in front of me with a knife asking me;
&quot;what do you want to do?&quot;. I was in such constant state throughout the
movie.<br /><br />Yes it's a very violent movie, with lots of gore, but this violence isn't
there just for &quot;fun&quot;, it's there because it plays a very important role. A
movie like this without this violence wouldn't be any good, it wouldn't
made
anyone think. The movie is to make you think, that's what happened to
me.
