Fight Club is a masterpiece of a movie. It is unlike any movie
I
have seen. It does not play like a conventional movie. The
plot
twist and turns with plenty of irony, crazy violence, action
and
sick jokes. It is one of those movies I think a lot of
people
will hate. I loved it! It has great performances from Edward
Norton, Brad Pitt, and Meat Loaf. Brad Pitt is at his best
playing a villain. Edward Norton is a top of the line actor.
David Fincher keeps getting better as a director. Fight Club
is
one of those movies that once you think the plot is going
one
way it goes another. I can't wait to see what crazy movie
David
Fincher comes up with next.
