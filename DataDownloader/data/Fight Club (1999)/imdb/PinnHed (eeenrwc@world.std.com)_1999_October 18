Mr. Fincher,
Congratulations on another coup de gras that undoubtedly takes
Hollywood
by storm, and raises the blood pressure of the P.C. crowd.  I can not
comment on the truth to the novel as I have not read it.  But the version I
witnessed was mesmerizing.  The two leads, ironically considered two of
Hollywood's leading &quot;Pretty Boys&quot; turn in gritty, adept performances that
certainly don't ring of &quot;Pretty Boy&quot;.  Helena Bonham Carter proves she'll
do
what a role calls for.  The remainder of the prominent cast, in their small
but important roles provide the necessary gung-ho to make this movie fly.
If they remade &quot;Terminal Man&quot;, they'd call it &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  As Brad Pitt
calls in the trailer, &quot;Fight Club&quot; takes it up a notch.  Those who
criticize
this movie for it's &quot;brutality, glorification of violence, love of pain&quot;
are, I'm sure, the same individuals who looked the other way during
&quot;Private
Ryan&quot;.  The violence in this movie is pervasive and graphic.  It is not,
however, gratutitous or unnecessary.  It sets a tone.  Think &quot;Clockwork
Orange&quot;.  The plot was NOT predictable, thereby thwarting the normal
Hollywood method.  I felt like I was watching the European &quot;The Vanishing&quot;
when it all played out.  And it made me smile and wince.  Smile at the
surprise, wince at the gripping story.  Obviously, I thouroughly enjoyed
this movie.  And it is not often I think how I can't wait to see it again.
To see how the director and cast obviously tipped their hand, and still
left
me in the dark.
