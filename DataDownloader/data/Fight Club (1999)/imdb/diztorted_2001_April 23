You enter into this film...and what do you see? &quot;Your power animal&quot;.
Mischief, Mayhem, Soap, is not just a slogan, it's not just a part of a fad
philosophy, it is a complete different way of life. This film is not for the
weak-minded, or for those who live their lives deep inside their happy
commercial, consumer life; but for those who are ready for the change. It is
a message for all of us saying &quot;I understand you&quot;. Acknowledge you are alive
by self-destruction rather than rot yourself between shallow stuff that will
only bring you temporary joy. By seeing this film, at the end you will be
scarred with lye, your eyes opened wide and reborn as someone different,
someone else.<br /><br />In his previous films, we could see how David Fincher sets us through the
mind of the mad men, the murky world of John Doe, the memories of Victor Van
Orton. But now, it is something completely different, we can see how the
brain of the narrator works and how the brain cells act as a gun is stuck
inside his mouth. This is only the beginning.<br /><br />Watching this film was really a &quot;Near life Experience&quot;, I felt how the world
of Tyler Durden invaded me and I became not only a voyeur watching how Fight
Club worked, but also a member of Fight Club itself. All the anger, the
frustration and the loneliness were washed away by a new Nihilist philosophy
that is hard to break. And after all this is Marla Singer, the symbol of the
unexpected, a person who is free in much ways the rest of us are not,
because she's not afraid to die. Some of us would like to be like that, but
we are afraid.<br /><br />I was afraid of writing about this film and not being able to really tell
what I really feel about it, but after all...What should I care for what any
of you would have to say! &quot;You have to give up&quot; There it is, I said
it.
