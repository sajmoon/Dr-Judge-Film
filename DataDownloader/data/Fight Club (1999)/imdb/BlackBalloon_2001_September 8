Fight Club is the kind of movie that leaves me feeling violated.  Violated
by another director's show-offy, pointless, violent fantasies.  When it was
ending, I felt that I was supposed to identify with the characters as they
held hands and watched buildings collapse- what?  What were they feeling at
that particular moment?  Happy?  I dunno.  Whatever, man.  Life is just,
like, one big Fight Club and it's not cool to be happy.  Besides, we all
know it would have been harder to make a movie about REAL, BORING life after
the building collapses and Marla becomes preggers.  But that doesn't include
bloody-male-flesh-on-bloody-male-flesh and shaved heads, does it?  I give
the movie makers credit for artfully creating mood and tone, but demonizing
modern office life is too easy.  We have no idea where this character is
coming from except for the fact that he's a bored and boring guy.  If he's
so clever, as Pitt calls him, why doesn't he go out and get a life?  It's
not that hard.  All you have to do is be likable.  Oops.  Dealing with
boring jobs is just a fact of life, deal with it.  That's why it's called a
job, you're supposed to hate it.  A perfect example of pretention playing to
the cheap seats in a not-so-subtle way.  Baby-faced Pitt as a muscle-bound
philosopher is completely implausible and ridiculous.  Skip this garbage and
rent Mary Poppins for a real movie.
