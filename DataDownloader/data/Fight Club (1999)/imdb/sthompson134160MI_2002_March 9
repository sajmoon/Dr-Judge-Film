Ignore the other reviews, they obviously didn't get it. The Fight Club 
is about a man who has everything you need to be considered
successful in today's society, but somehow his subconscious
realizes how empty he really feels. His subconscious creates a
fictional alter ego that guides him through several scenarios that
increasing lead to an anarchistic view of society. At the end of the
film, the main character, Tyler Durden, played simultaneously by
Ed Norton and Brad Pitt has his mind blown when he comes to
grips with the fact that he has a second personality. The film itself
is well made, with excellent cinematography, and realistic
dialogue and scenery, The action scenes involving the Fight Club
are riveting. The message of this movie is how material things that
you own end up owning you.
