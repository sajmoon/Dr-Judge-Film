1999_December 8 

Cowering under the shadow of Kubrick, this film is terrified of its own
implications, and so emasculates them by a ludicrous twist; an act of
creative vandalism as serious as the framing device in THE CABINET OF
CALIGARI.  Investigation of social malaise reduced to whinging male angst -
like we need more of THAT.  Brave initial incoherence and fragmentation
jettisoned for plot and convention.  Fear of women the real problem -
anti-capitalism a childish, major-studio-sponsored joke.  Brilliantly funny,
though - works best as harmless black comedy.
