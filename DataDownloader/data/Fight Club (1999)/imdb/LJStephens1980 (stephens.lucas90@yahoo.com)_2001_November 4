2001_November 4 

Having watched Fight Club, yesterday on the 4th November, I found that this
really is a flim about society that is repressed under the weight of a
consumer driven society.<br /><br />I shall not go into the story, except to simply say, that Fight Club,
deserves more than one viewing in order to understand it. This being my 5th,
and that I own a copy of it.<br /><br />Fight Club is simply one of the best movies ever, and I urge people to watch
this dark rollacoster ride into the darker underlying of human experience.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />
