The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible
(especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired,
and
the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five
years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen
it
only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie
would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay,
Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.<br /><br />So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had
a
mismatched ad campaign.  The ads made it seem like the movie was about
street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a
man's
psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer
society.
As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who
would
recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters.  This is
one of the most underrated movies I know.<br /><br />I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and
this movie scores a 10 in both.  Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or
The
Matrix really should check it out.
