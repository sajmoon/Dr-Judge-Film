This film may be one of the most popular films of all time, but it has
had a very bad affect on a generation. The makers of this film believe
this was about corporations selling out. In fact in the trivia section
Edward Norton and Brad Pitt state they hate the VW Beatle and destroyed
one in the film because they felt that &#x22;this kind of corporate selling
out was exactly what the film was railing against, hence the inclusion
of the car; Brad is quoted as saying; &#x22;It&#x27;s a perfect example of the
Baby Boomer generation marketing its youth culture to us.&#x22; What
hypocrisy. What do they think they were marketing to a new younger
generation? Something more harmful and damaging than a car that
represented &#x22;Love &#x26; Flower Power&#x22;.<br /><br />We lived in Orange County, CA. when this film came out. Our son and his
friends were in their teens. This film was a hit and a cult following
to them. Because of this film and Ed and Brad were these kid&#x27;s heroes.
Following the film it became a weekend activity by a lot of boys all
over Orange County to go to the parks at night and fight. The fights
were recorded and then put on the internet for all their buddies to
see. The hospitals began to see an increase of boys being injured
fighting. The police got involved and began investigating. Our son was
caught fighting one night. The court prosecutor wanted to make an
example of our son and others to try and put an end to this fad which
was promoted by this film. My son was prosecuted with a felony and
spent 90 days in jail and has struggled with the emotional scares
since.<br /><br />The hypocrisy of this is that the statement the film makers thought
they were making and railing against is exactly what they ended up
marketing and promoting themselves. But their product that represents a
new young culture hurt a that generation far worse than what the Baby
Boomers promoted. Ed, Brad,Dave and the crew have a lot to answer for.
I applaud those who were smart enough to recognize the hypocrisy and
dropped out of the project.
