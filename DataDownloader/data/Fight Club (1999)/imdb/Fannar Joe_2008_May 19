Okay Fight club is a very strange movie. But non the less it&#39;s very
good but i just don&#39;t get it why people are always saying this is such
a brilliant movie. It&#39;s very good but it&#39;s not brilliant. The
conversations in this movie are very well written and the actors are
terrific but Helena Bonham carter could have been a lot better. Edward
Norton was very good as always. Brad Pitt proved that he can act. The
fights are very cool. But i still don&#39;t get what is so brilliant about
this movie? the first 45 minutes he&#39;s just talking to himself and then
after that the action begins. But i really think that this movie is
very overrated but it still a movie anybody needs to see before he
dies, i think. It&#39;s very good but not brilliant. What more can i say
about this movie... Oh yes the ending was very clever but i&#39;m not going
to tell you (who are reading this) the ending because than i would be
ruining a very good movie for you (but remember it&#39;s not brilliant) but
go rent this movie or buy it because it it worth it but don&#39;t think
that when you are going to watch it , than don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to
see a masterpiece. okay?
