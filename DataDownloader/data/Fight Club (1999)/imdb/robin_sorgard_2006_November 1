I love this movie. Great acting by Edvard Norton and Brad Pitt. The
story is great, and at the movie-end you get pretty surprised. The
soundtrack is wonderful. One of my favorite movies of all time :)
Recommended :)<br /><br />&quot;You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will
ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you&#39;re
satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you&#39;ve got your sofa
issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The
drapes. The rug. Then you&#39;re trapped in your lovely nest, and the
things you used to own, now they own you.&quot;
