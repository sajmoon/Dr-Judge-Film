To start, this is my 2nd favorite next to Shawshank. Ed Norton, my 2nd
favorite actor next to Kevin Spacey, is amazing in this. Brad Pitts
best role ever, closely followed by Se7en and Snatch, shines in this
film. Basically a great story added to by creative cinematography and
some of the best lighting in any movie i've seen. David Fincher's
greatest in my opinion, though I don't think hes hit his peak. This
should and will become a classic. There are so many quotes in this
movie that just make you feel like your watching a good film. &quot;I am
jacks smirking revenge&quot; (And all the &quot;I am Jacks...&quot; quotes) There are
movies that have traits that are better than Fight Club, but all
around, Fight Club owns all but Shawshank. This movie is a must see and
will easily become a classic. If you don't like it, dig a hole, and
live there the rest of your life. Or just check out some other movies,
like Euro Trip or American Wedding, because maybe you just have no
taste.
