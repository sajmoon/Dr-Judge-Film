The Renaissance sculptor Rodin said, a great work of art can still be
seen as a great work of art, even if it is broken or incomplete.<br /><br />Nothing more typifies this than Fight Club. I could list all the
problems, plot holes, human psychology errors etc with this movie (and
I haves watched this movie many times so I know what they are). However
that would give away most of the plot and the plot twists.<br /><br />However balancing this is an incredibly challenging, exciting, funny
and interesting film that works on so many different levels.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays the every man character. Single, with a successful
job that he hates and he knows is reinforcing corporate evil. He has a
condo and all the IKEA furniture that a space monkey would want.<br /><br />But he suffers from insomnia and he finds the perfect cure, attending
support groups for things like testicular cancer. There he meets
another &quot;tourist&quot; Marla, a crazy girl who has accepted that she could
die at any time, but is angry that she doesn't.<br /><br />From this he is rescued by Tyler. Tyler is everything he wants to be.
Handsome (played by Brad Pitt), dresses the way he wants to dress, does
the things he wants to do and (how to say this politely) performs the
act of coitus in the way he wants to.<br /><br />Tyler drags him into Planet Tyler. Starting fight club creates a
phenomenon. Men fight, men are bonded by fighting, not by shopping.
Tyler has a plan and before you know it a revolution has started.<br /><br />Any good revolutionary knows that revolutions require the ordinary
people of the world. They are the people who drive you ambulances,
serve you food, watch your house when you sleep at night.<br /><br />This movies manages to disturb, excite, educate and entertain all at
the same time. People have even started their own &quot;fight clubs&quot;. But
remember, in this movie Tyler is a extreme of the everyman dream. He
sees the total destruction of the world, both in terms of destroying
the institutions of society and in destroying the future by rejecting
women. All so he can be &quot;a man&quot;.<br /><br />Tyler is not the voice of reason, merely a clever argument in the
search for yourself.<br /><br />Your project Mayhem assignment for this week is to start a fight with a
complete stranger and lose. Space monkeys, keep watching this space for
