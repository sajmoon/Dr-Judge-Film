Fight club changed my life.  This is not a movie, it is a way of life.
There is no possible way that someone can experience this and not be
drastically changed by it.  First off, the artistic element is
overwhelming.
It is an art form in itself.  If every film team put the energy used to
make Fight Club, the movie industry would be raised to a new level.  I
suggest this to every race, every family, everybody.  If you have not seen
it, close this window immediately and have a &quot;near-life
experience&quot;.
