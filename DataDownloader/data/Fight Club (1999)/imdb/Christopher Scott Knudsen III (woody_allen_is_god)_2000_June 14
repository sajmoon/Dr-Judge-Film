&quot;Fight Club&quot; was probably the biggest surprise for me last year.  I went in
and expected &quot;Fight Club&quot; to be alright but not as spectacular as it was.
It is the greatest male bonding film to ever be created.  The acting was
kept realistic, the scripts dark and humorous tone was right on contact,
the
cinemtography was beautifully done using guralla camera-work, the editing
had its good effects, sound-effects and sound effects editing (only
catogory
nominated) were awesome and wonderful to hear on THX, and the visual
effects
didn't have the fake wet look and looked really accurate when used.  &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is the best film of the year of 1999.
