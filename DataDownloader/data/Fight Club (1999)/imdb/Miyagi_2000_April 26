Fight CLub was a pleasant surprise.  I'll be honest, when I first saw clips
of this film I did not have any desire to watch it at all.  However, I did
wind up watching and am very happy to say that it was an excellent film. 
The storyline is great, a little confusing, but not so much that you'll miss
stuff as long as you pay attention to the movie.  The acting was great,
Edward Norton reached the usual high standards that he has set from other
fine performances.  Brad Pitt also did an excellent job, although it really
seems like he plays the same type of character in each film that he is in. 
The film had humor, action, suspense, and plenty of drama.  I highly
recommend Fight Club.  8/10
