1999_November 30 

To be honest, I've never seen anything like this film. OK, this isn't the
most violent, amusing, mentally challenging or disturbing film I have ever
seen but the sheer blend of all these qualities is what makes this film
probably my favourite this year.<br /><br />The film starts fairly simply, following the life of an insomniac office
jockey trying to find a route to happiness but before too long you find it
delving into deeper things. Much, much deeper things. And just when you
thought it couldn't get any deeper or more intimidating, it
does.<br /><br />And that's the beauty of it. The narration and the performances take place
in such a relaxed, laid back style you don't realise just how serious some
things really are until half a second later than you should. Then it hits
you twice as hard as it would do otherwise, leaving 'wow' the only word on
your mind. And you can completely forget about trying to predict the plot of
this film. It twists more times than I care to count but in the end it all
makes perfect sence.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is David Fincher's finest film yet, even eclipsing
Seven. This is the sort of film where you can forget about technical things
and get completely immersed. You also have to think whilst you watch it and
I like that a lot. Not only that, but you will be left thinking about it for
weeks afterwards. The acting performances by the main characters is superb
all round and that includes Meatloaf. There is more style than you could
shake a stick at.<br /><br />Bad points? To be honest, I enjoyed the film so much that I can't think of
any off the top of my head. It did get a bit surreal and freaky in places
but then again those are the two words of the day when it comes down to
it.<br /><br />Be warned however, this film won't appeal to everybody. It does take a
rather uncompromising scoop into the human psyche and deals in a lot of
primal urges and quite expectedly, it gets violent in places. This won't
appeal to everyone but it certainly struck a chord with me. It makes a
change to the usual stuff Hollywood normally churns out at
least.
