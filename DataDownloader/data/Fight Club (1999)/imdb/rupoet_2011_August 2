&#x22;The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club...&#x22;
These words have become synonymous with perhaps one of the greatest
films of all time and one of the most well-known lines ever spoken.
With outstanding performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, Fight
Club breaks down the barriers of the norm and manages to unravel it
with an unforgiving dialogue, reinforced with a powerfully raw energy
that has rarely been seen. Norton&#x27;s character is quickly forced to face
the sad and miserable reality of his existence with his introduction to
Tyler Durden, a free spirit unbound by the rules and expectations of a
society that he believes seeks only to oppress and conform. An instant
cult classic, Fight Club not only influenced a generation but since its
release, has still managed to remain a &#x27;Bible&#x27; for the &#x22;everyday&#x22; man&#x27;s
feeling about himself and the society that he so eagerly tries to
maintain an identity within. Fight Club, in its design will always
break its first rule.
