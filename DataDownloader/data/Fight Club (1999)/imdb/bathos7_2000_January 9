Yes, I thought that this was a great film, Finchers ability to mold and
sculpt film is an amazing visual ride.<br /><br />No, I had no urge to punch anyone, or start any Fight Clubs after the film.
There isn't any irresponsibility of anyone that made this film.  They
presented it, and it's up to you to watch it and decide for YOURSELVES what
it means to you.
I love when I watch something and it creates all sorts of questions inside
my head.  It's a failure if it doesn't spark something inside of yourself,
whether hate, love, confusion, etc...   Fight Club did this for me.<br /><br />
