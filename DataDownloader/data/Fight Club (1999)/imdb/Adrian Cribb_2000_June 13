Why oh why do I give David Fincher a second chance? My mind always wanders
when watching his films and pictures him at various moments over, say, 2
months writing his little ideas down as they come to him. This movie is
clearly the culmination of about 20 of those ideas and some that were
brought back from the waste paper basket. Strung together with thread bare
plotting. 
Oh and please, David, give your set designer the day off for the next one.
He/she's needed at a new theme park to do the haunted house.
2 out of 10. 1 for the lead actors who give it there best and 1 for Brad
Pitt's bum cleavage that gave the movie its best too.
