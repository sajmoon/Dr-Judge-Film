Fight Club leaves the watcher with a strange feeling. Actually I was
thinking to myself: What the...just happened. Only Lost Highway gave me
that
feeling before. Fight Club is a visual stunning movie. Now there are more
movies that are that but there are few movies that also have a great story.
I mean I figured out The Sixth Sense within five minutes but I never saw
this plot twist coming.
THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.
The only thing is that I feel like I am the only one who has a different
viewing point regarding the ending. Please feel free to help me with
this.<br /><br />Can't wait to have my own copy of this on D.V.D.<br /><br />Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
