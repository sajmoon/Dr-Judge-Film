This film is so good you will want to be invovled in a fight club. It
makes
you realize how short life is and makes you realize that youve just got to
enjoy life and live it to the maximum. Also the acting is brilliant from
both Brad Pitt,Edward Norton and Meat Loaf ernt bad either. Also David
Fincher is one of the best directors in film history his films include:
Se7en and Panic Room which are both excellent. This is one of the best
films
ive personally seen and the soundtrack is amazing especially Pixies 'where
is my mind' its brilliant. thats all i wanted to say.
