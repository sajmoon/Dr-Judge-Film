to those of us who know that nagging sense of misapprehension, of knowing
that no matter how well we force  ourselves to behave, there is this other
part that resists, that has to do with our primal role as the guardian of
the perimeter of our own sense of safety, this movie appears as a gift, a
sudden unexpected recognition that what we have always known as immutably
isolated individuals is, in fact, true for all of us. whether we are less
or
more or simply equal, here we have the first cultural return, wrapped in
all
of the crap, in all of the willful illusion we have perpetrated on
ourselves, and , yet bursting to the seams with the truth of the cruelty
of
being whatever it is that we are. in short, if you are lucky enough to
have
a female friend, lover, whatever, who is willing and/or able to sit
through
and respond to this, then, i swear, by all that i know, you are on the
right
track.
on the other hand, if this movie doesn't make you wonder about yourself,
then you are too young or too dead. in either case, i have nothing left to
say.
