Personally I think this movie was awesome. Sure, I was super-annoyed at
the
amount of bad language in there. The atmosphere was just evil, I mean,
it's
a really dark movie, but I can really enjoy that, with a movie at least,
and
I thoroughly enjoyed it with this one. WOW, how did they ever come up with
this.<br /><br />Camera shots were SUPER! Great creative angles, and stuff, you know, I'm
not
that good a critic, just LOVED the camera work.<br /><br />I really had to keep my wits about me to understand the plot line, it has
soooo much potential of becoming major confusing, but that's just
awesome...
if you like it like I do that is... LOL.<br /><br />Surprises all over the place, and believe it or not, with all the crappy
language, and all the bitter violence, I laughed my *ss off several times
as
well!!!<br /><br />HOW DID THEY DO THAT?<br /><br />I really dunno.<br /><br />* I laughed like crazy.
* I was totally grossed out many times.
* I was horrified right down to my gut at the realism.
* I was surprised at all the twists in the plot, creativeness, originality
of everything.
* I was completely taken up in the characters.
* I was stunned by the numerous stabs to society, sociology and life in
general.<br /><br />Man, I cannot possibly explain this, but normally I would have hated this
movie, but this, this was so well done, I can only love
it.<br /><br />Although I probably won't watch it again, now that I know what's
coming.<br /><br />
