Ever since i saw fincher's first film (alien 3) i knew i was witnessing
special talent.  yeah, a lot of people badmouth alien 3, but it holds a
special place in my heart.  every film fincher does surpasses his previous
film about tenfold.<br /><br />Fight Club was a great cerebral thriller that combines great acting,
beautiful direction, the blackest of dark comedy, and a wonderful story to
make possibly one of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />Fight club is about more than a bunch of sweaty guys getting together and
beating each other sensless.  it is about society, and not knowing your
place in it.  more than not knowing your place in it, actually, it is
about
not HAVING a place in society to begin with.<br /><br />in the dvd, edward norton discusses how the film relates to the graduate,
which really, i think is very accurate.  both films have a lot of similar
themes, and i think in the end of both, you get the same thing out of it.
and you question yourself because of it.  definitely read the book by
chuck
palhinuk.  wonderful read.  and check out the score as composed by the
dust
brothers.  pure sonic bliss.
