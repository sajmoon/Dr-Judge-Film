&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a movie born to let people discuss. It can be considered a
masterpiece of the modern times (as I did) or a stupid and excessive movie.
The story is told us by an anonymous Narrator (symbol of the every man),
which is disappointed by his life and find comfort visiting people affected
by cancer. Then he meets two dropouts like him: the strange Marla Singer
(Helena Bonham carter, dressed like a scarecrow) and the fascinating Tyler
Durden, which involves him in an hurricane of violence and anarchy. And the
Narrator doesn't know how to stop him and himself. The story begins with a
fantastic introduction in the false - golden life of the narrator, affected
by insomnia and depression and it is like a shout for freedom in a society
trapped by herself in the logic of &quot;making money&quot;. Tyler founds an
organization called Mayhem to destroy all the false symbols of a life untrue
and makes little acts of terrorism, introducing frames of porn movies in
movies for children. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton gives two astonishing
performances: the first is fantastic in denying his image of sex-symbol for
an acting voted to destruction, the second, the normal man willing to revolt
to society, is one of the best actors of 2000.
