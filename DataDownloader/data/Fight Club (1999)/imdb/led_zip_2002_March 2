This movie tries to give you a feeling of it's being serious and giving
you
some time of message. But, if you think about it critically, this movie is
a
piece of crap. There is a lot of violence, drug use, glamour, explosions,
penises, and music, but that's all there is to it. Trust me, this movie is
bad for anyone's mind. It will tell you it's okay to be bad, and that it's
okay to fight, and that it's good to do stupid things. The makers try to
soften the movie up by providing some sort of message in the end, but
that's
just an exuse for unexusable violence. Movies like this DO destroy minds.
This movie going to mess up your mind. This movie is bad, it's evil, it's
too violent. Only people who enjoy this movie are punks, depressed middle
aged men, and losers in general.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is cinematography and
imagery.
