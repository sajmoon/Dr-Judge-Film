Well now.  I do admit that this was a much better film than I'd expected.  I
like Pitt and Norton and a mercifully brief Bonham Carter is appreciated. 
I've been skimming through the comments and wonder if a majority missed the
'new man' being developed in this film.  Norton and Pitt come into their own
in an all male club.  What's up with that?!  The one female presence is
brought in for sex and sensitivity.  hmmm.  Another thing I have to admit:
though I'm female, this film made me want to work out and beat the pulp out
of Pitt.
I agree that it is aimed at the 'MTV generation.'  No problem there save
that it's anarchy lite.  I wonder how much Pepsi paid to place their
commercial on the 'squat' tv?  Did any 'MTV generation' catch that?  Then
the main character turns into a fascist commanding the blind loyalty of
hordes of disaffected men.  NOT an anarchist.  Can we please not mix our
political ideologies here?!  The film is a step in the right direction.  Now
we need to spread the word about International Buy Nothing Day.  But would
Hollywood do that?
