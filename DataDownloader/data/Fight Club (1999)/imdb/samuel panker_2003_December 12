Anyone who thinks Brad Pitt is just a &quot;pretty boy&quot; [even before this film]
has to have their head checked, yes he is a movie star but this
performance
deserved recognition for him as an ACTOR. The same goes for Norton, both
legends in my book. The direction from Fincher boggles my mind, I just
dont
understand how you go about making a film like this. What he does with the
camera makes him stand out on his own. GENIUS.
