2001_November 8 

Take a great book (by Chuck Palahniuk), adapt it cleverly into a screenplay
(by Jim Uhls), hand the whole package over to David Fincher, and what do
you
get?  A dark, twisted, violent, subversive commentary on the
disillusionment
of the American male at the turn of the century.  Just below the surface of
a society where the things you own begin to own you, two(?) radicals have
started a bold movement called &quot;Fight Club,&quot; where the only way to feel
alive again is to physically beat and be beaten in an all-out mano-a-mano
brawl.  Though it could be dismissed by a more squeamish audience as too
brutal, the themes in this film will have the rest of us coming back for
more.  It is surprisingly similar to &quot;American Beauty&quot; in theme, but
completely opposite in its delivery.  Plus, the last quarter of the film
should leave first-time viewers reeling.
