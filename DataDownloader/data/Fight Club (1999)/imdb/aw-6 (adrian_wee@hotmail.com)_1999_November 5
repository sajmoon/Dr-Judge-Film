1999_November 5 

This film was passed uncut to the local audience and it just blew my mind.
I saw the film twice over two consecutive nights and I'm waiting for my
friends to go see it a third, a fourth, a fifth....... you get the
picture!<br /><br />What can I say about it that has not already been said and re-said
countless
times?!  Film of the millenium, shakes up your life, ........  well, every
word is true and I never thought two hours and twenty minutes can be so
sweetly savoured.  Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter were awsome and
so
many points droned on and on by Ed Norton, hit home.  Brad  Pitt, well, not
a fan but I just felt he was acting as himself, can't be too much of a
stretch, right?  Or is his acting so good that I just assume the character
and the actor are one?<br /><br />So many layers and ways to look at the picture and so many jaw-dropping
images: from the highly stylised sex scenes to the rotating shots of the
gas
cooker before ignition - I was on a constant high as I let my visual senses
get assaulted left, right and centre.........  Damn!  Got to see it one
more
time!<br /><br />Is this film a social critique on our consumerism lifestyle?  A
condemnation
of blind random acts of violence?  The emasculation of men of this
generation?  The realisation of the person we would like to be but are not?
There are just too many points to be consumed at one sitting, I'm
sure........<br /><br />
