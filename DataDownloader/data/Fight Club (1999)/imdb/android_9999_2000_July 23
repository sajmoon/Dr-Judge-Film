I was expecting to see a fairly serious dramatic movie, but was pleasantly
surprised by this twisted and some what weird movie that has the right
touch
of action, humor, and dramatic moments.<br /><br />I actually enjoy the narrative, I know, some people are put off by actors
narrating their thoughts out loud and prefer reading the actors'
expressions, but I think a lot will be missed in this morning to try to
figure out the weird thoughts people have in their mind.<br /><br />This is a good movie... hope to see more of it.<br /><br />
