1999_November 1 

And that isn't a compliment.  Although the first 90 minutes pass in a
single, exhilirated breath, never will you see such an excellent movie
derail itself with one, unnecessary plot twist. The novel, by all
appearances, must be worse.  Movie critics rant about the film's violence
and nihilism (one is to assume that Saving Private Ryan is a Looney Tunes
clip).  Why do none of them speak a word about dimestore metaphysics and
first-rate plot holes?  This movie is a joke on the audience, but the
audience is laughing with it.
