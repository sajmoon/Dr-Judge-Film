2004_September 18 

The first half is quite fun, rather anarchic and enjoyable, my<br /><br />favourite scene being the 'power animal' penguin in his cave.<br /><br />But the film is firstly too long, secondly rather silly towards the end<br /><br />and thirdly easily foreseeable. It's above average, but that's really
it. It's one of the films that<br /><br />makes you wonder why no-one told the director to cut it a bit - he's<br /><br />so much in love with his own style and story that the help of<br /><br />another person might have helped the film a lot. Anyway, watch it if
you want some entertainment! It's certainly an OK<br /><br />Saturday eve!
