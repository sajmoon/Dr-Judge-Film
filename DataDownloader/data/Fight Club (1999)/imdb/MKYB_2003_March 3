Fight Club struck me hard. David Fincher has created a fantastic movie
that
does not miss out on anything. Every time I see it I think it&acute;s better
and
better. Every angle and image in this production screams out how much
Fincher loves the art of film-making. He is simply &quot;a genius
mastermind&quot;.
The duet of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton works incredibly well. They
complete
each-other. My judgment of films in general will never be the same since
I
first saw the almost as great movie &quot;Seven&quot; also by David Fincher. He&acute;s
high
standard in film-making has truly carved in a deep marking in my personal
film-grading-system. His movies are simply &quot;the&quot; best and the most
thought-through I have and probably ever will see in my
life.<br /><br />David Fincher... You make me whole!!!
