David Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is both a wild ride and a savagely 
funny satire, as thought-provoking as it is exciting. The entire cast
is nothing short of terrific, from Norton's deadpan voice over to
Meatloaf's estrogen-amped shlub. The screenplay, adapted from
the excellent Chuck Palahniuk novel, is also exceptionally
well-crafted, and features an ending that even Palahniuk agrees is
better. Fincher continues his impressive feature directing career
(including the well-made &quot;The Game,&quot; the grisly yet endlessly
fascinating &quot;Seven,&quot; and the egregiously underrated &quot;Alien 3&quot;). I
can't imagine a better style for this sort of adaptation.
Controversial, to be sure, but if you pay attention and keep an open
mind, it will grab you and hold on. One of the best films of the the
90's.
