I am sorry but I&#39;m going to be straightforward with you. This movie is
almost pure garbage if not for a curious story that keeps some
interested enough to finish watching it. The only people I know who
like this film are guys that think it&#39;s cool to like it, so upon
watching it they come up with some reason why it&#39;s totally awesome. One
of my friends called it the &quot;ultimate guy film.&quot; Well, if this is the
ultimate guy film, I feel pretty stupid being a guy. I&#39;ve seen too many
people try and mock this film by making their own &quot;fight clubs&quot; and
watching this movie religiously. You know today&#39;s culture; if it&#39;s &quot;in&quot;
it&#39;s good material, even if it&#39;s completely untrue. Liking Fight Club
is in for guys, you&#39;re not really allowed to have an opinion about it -
that&#39;s just final. You have to like it.<br /><br />I can speak for a lot of people, especially women, when I say this
movie is total garbage. It&#39;s a sporadic feeding frenzy for the ego.
It&#39;s all about rebellion and empowerment, in a sick sort of way.
Delivered in an almost erotic package, it makes it quite appealing to
the average guy.<br /><br />This movie is NO different from your clich&eacute; summer flicks. You&#39;ve got
your sex, violence, and psychopathic hero all in one movie.<br /><br />Oh, but he&#39;s a schizophrenic, I almost forgot. Better give it extra
points. When you really look at Fight Club, it&#39;s a film similar to any
other Hollywood blockbuster with a ingenious disguise. It worked and it
has its following it wanted.<br /><br />But in the big picture, the majority of people hate this movie. People
who love it like to force it upon other people to enjoy it. It&#39;s like a
vicious circle of fanatical Fight Club fans trying to suck you in.
Don&#39;t give in to it...<br /><br />If you didn&#39;t understand the movie you didn&#39;t understand it for a
reason. If you didn&#39;t like it you didn&#39;t like it for a reason. Don&#39;t
try and make yourself enjoy it. This is NOT A good film. It&#39;s a device.<br /><br />If you want the non-commercialized Fight Club, read the damn book.
