Edward Norton plays a white-collar worker whose condominium has just
burned down. Having no friends, he is forced to move in with Tyler
Durden, a crazy soap salesman that he just met on a plane. Together
they form an underground cult where men fight each other just for the
heck of it. There is a lot more to the story, and this film is full of
twists and turns, so I don&#x27;t want to say anything more to avoid
spoiling this fantastic movie.<br /><br />This film has garnered a reputation for being very violent, but I don&#x27;t
think that is fair. Obviously there is quite a bit of violence, but it
is necessary and, in my opinion, not overdone. What makes this film so
good is its original story, excellent dialog, and the little things put
in it to make it a very re-watchable movie. The story is great and
unlike any other I have ever known. It creates an opportunity for a
great atmosphere and wonderful acting performances, both of which are
capitalized on in the film. The dialog is brilliant and contains the
perfect amount of black comedy, particularly in the narration. I&#x27;d be
hard-pressed to find my favorite line in the film. Finally, this being
the third time I have watched this movie, every scene contains little
lines or little references to the twist at the end. I never even
noticed them the first time I watched the film, yet it seems to obvious
when you go back and re-watch it. With every viewing I notice something
new, and I cannot wait to watch it again.
