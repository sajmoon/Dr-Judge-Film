What a masterpiece! I have never seen a more twisted or original movie
like
this one was.
I wont tell you too much because it would completely spoil it for you, but
I
can tell you prepare for the ride of your life. Edward Norton plays a guy
who is in a life crisis and who radicially tires to make something with
his
life. that is all I tell you about it, and it is probably already too
much,
just watch it yourself and let surprise yourself with it.<br /><br />It is actually a very underrated movie, as much as I remember it failed at
the cinema but became a real cult movie after the video release and also
quit succsesful. As much as it was ignored at the box office it was
ignored
by award shows. The three leading protagonists Edward Norton, Brad Pitt
and
Helena Bonham Carter give all together Oscar worthy performance but I
think
their characters were too cruel or too trashy to get the Oscar recognition
the would deserve.
Especially Norton is brilliant here, I really can&acute;t get enough of his
acting
energy he is such a brilliant actor and it would be a shame if he ever
stoped acting, a big loss for the cinema.
Now to the direction: It was phenomenal! David Fincher is such a brilliant
director I hardly find words to describe his great talent. I love his dark
style, the mysterious characters he creates and the great, believable and
actually logical twists he put in his movies.
I actually always find something new when I see this movie, something I
haven&acute;t realized before, that&acute;s why it is always fun to watch this movie
again and again.
The screenplay is wonderful too, there are a lot of great, quotable and
memroabel dialogues, oh and I think after watching this movie, you will
use
soap on a different way.. 10/10
