Unfortunately, it seems many people are attracted to the philosophy the film
ends up exposing as an empty fallacy.  Someone commented that &quot;This film is
the voice of disillusionment, of realising that the world we live in places
unrealistic hopes and expectations on our lives and goals.&quot;  Excuse me, no:
WE place them.  Nobody is responsible for the choices we make in our lives
but us.  Norton's character--and anybody like him--is trapped only by his
inability to make those necessary choices in his life.  And the answer isn't
anarchy.  While the ending is somewhat disappointing and goofy, at least the
film has the intelligence to recognize that fact.  Fight Club is a very well
done movie, with an intoxicating visual style, compelling script, and
performances that will blow your hair back.  But lest anyone miss it, what
Tyler espouses *is* a bad thing, for the individual and society, and that's
the real moral of the movie.  Unfortunately a lot of folks not only do seem
to be missing that, but doing so enthusiastically, which is kind of
pathetic, and a little unsettling.
