1999_November 24 

Great book, great film--I prefer the film. Not only does it improve on
several aspects of the book, but it is also visually stunning. It's like
&quot;2001&quot; without outer space. The &quot;outer space&quot; we see are in the head of
the
narrator: his vision of the metropolis in which he lives, the night life,
the dark exteriors of bars, the bright headlights on the highway,
etc.<br /><br />What is the first rule of Fight Club? &quot;Don't talk about Fight Club.&quot; What
is
the second rule of Fight Club? &quot;Don't talk about Fight Club.&quot; The first
two
rules of Fight Club are the same--remember the first two rules. The major
plot twist (people who have seen the film or have read the book know what
I'm talking about) makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; an original, instant cult classic,
right up there with &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, and
other cult classics. Many who have seen the film don't follow the rules.
If
you have seen the film, keep your mouth shut when people who haven't seen
it
(and who want to see it) are around. Don't ruin this great film for
them.<br /><br />But there is more to &quot;Fight Club&quot;. It is a satire on life in the present
day. It comments on consumerism and who we conceive ourselves to be. &quot;This
is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.&quot; Tyler says he doesn't
want to die without any scars, well, neither do I. &quot;Fight Club&quot; tells us
to
make an impact on our lives, on today's society, on the future's society.
Hopefully, though, we'll learn to make an impact beneficial to everyone.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; beats out &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; as my favorite movie of 1999, even
though Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director.
