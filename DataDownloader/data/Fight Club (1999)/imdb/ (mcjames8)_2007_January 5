This film is incredible. I watched it not quite knowing what to expect
and from the very start i was utterly transfixed and never wanted it to
end.It was so well directed and visually it is incredible. I found
myself thinking &quot;wow, that was a brilliant shot&quot; every five seconds. It
was also superbly acted with Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helen Bonham-
Carter giving performances of a lifetime. Pitt especially manages to
make his character Tyler Durden possibly the coolest character ever to
grace the silver screen. Norton also manages to make his character
superbly awkward and intense. This film is not only amazingly made but
it is also a thrilling story and contains probably the best plot ever
in the history of film as it seems to contain everything. Incredible
Film!!!! You have to see it or you haven&#39;t lived!
