From a person who knows about ironic life: See it... Crash your mind
keep you on the chair Like is simple and ironic After you finish...you
see again Days after you see again Analyze your life Change your
lifestyle. Change the cinema Who is the writer of this you think See it
again you think. Never be the same. You want to do thinks like buy the
t shirt!. But you hate this things but you want to say. Soaps. Can't
say about the film it is. See it without read nothing before.IMDb Say
