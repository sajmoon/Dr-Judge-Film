Fight Club director David Fincher (Alien 3, Seven and The Game) is obviously<br /><br />gearing up to do the next US Army recruiting commercials. Who else could<br /><br />capture the S&amp;M fantasies of military life? The fascist rituals of shaving
hair and 
institutional brutality have never been so lovingly filmed.<br /><br />In Meet Joe Black, Brad Pitt played Death. In Fight Club, he plays the
Antichrist, 
spewing Satanic Zen lines like, &quot;If our fathers could do what they did<br /><br />[abandoning their children], what does that tell you about
God?&quot;<br /><br />His character, a multipersonality alter, is raging at the mind control
atrocities and 
the perpetrators that created his system.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Edward Norton's first big role was in Primal Fear. He<br /><br />played a psychopathic former altar boy accused of murdering a Chicago<br /><br />archbishop. Richard Gere played the attorney who defended him very<br /><br />successfully.<br /><br />Fight Club is a movie about mind control. Think Raising Cain on bad acid. Or
an 
ironic hip update of A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />It's also a ceremonial psychodrama, intent on the engineering of the mind,
as 
seemingly normal individuals are transformed into mind-controlled robotic<br /><br />assassin-bombers.<br /><br />Will it trigger other &quot;models&quot; to fulfill their &quot;contracts&quot;? Only time will
tell. But the 
final explosion, which blows up the Century City skyline of L.A., is like an<br /><br />Illuminati slap in the face.<br /><br />No matter how many mind control survivors get deprogrammed &#150; the Illuminati<br /><br />are telling you &#150; there will always be somebody that comes through and
fulfills 
his or her &quot;contract&quot; for the New World Order.<br /><br />Fight Club lets you peek into a secret world. It ain't pretty, but the next
time you 
hear about a lone nut assassin or a lone nut bomber&#133;.<br /><br />Think Fanta!
