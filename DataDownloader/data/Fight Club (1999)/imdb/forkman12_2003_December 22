Fight Club is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's more than a movie,
it's the new bible as far as I'm concerned. Whether people want to admit it
or not, being a man in modern America is not all it's cracked up to be. And
that's what this movie is about. Self-awareness, enlightenment and total
control over your emotions is what this movie will help you learn about.<br /><br />Fight Club warns us about the brainwashing of the mass media. The media of a
society that destroys our souls so we'll be robots for the system. It will
teach you that the things you own don't matter. What really matters is how
you feel about yourself inside.<br /><br />And the best way to feel good about yourself is to win a fight with another
man! Who can argue that?! Fighting is a form of therapy in this movie. After
a night of fighting the main character is completely calm and cool the next
day at work. Nothing angers him anymore. Not even those little everyday
annoyances like his stupid boss. Every man should own this movie and watch
it regularly. Not only is it a masterpiece of moviemaking, it's a
masterpiece of philosophy.
