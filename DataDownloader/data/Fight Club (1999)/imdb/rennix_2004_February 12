2004_February 12 

When this came out I didn't want to see it. TV and radio stations were
flooded with Fight Club ads and Fox initially tried to sell the movie as one
of these &quot;I'll beat the cr*p out of you&quot; movies. 
I guess this drew the wrong audience into the theaters and most people were
disappointed because they didn't get to see blood and guts and
superheroes.
So I was very surprised when I got hold of the DVD and watched it for the
first time (and then a second time, and a third time and on and
on...)<br /><br />Although the philosophy behind it isn't as deep and profound as other
reviewers at imdb have claimed it to be, it is still a very fascinating and
strange movie - unlike anything you would expect from a Hollywood major
studio.<br /><br />Fincher created a dark and visually stunning movie with a terrific cast
and...well..some plotholes.<br /><br />But nevertheless. This is a &quot;must see&quot;. Eventually this will be considered
the classic 90's movie.<br /><br />Not to forget the great Pixies Song &quot;Where is my mind&quot; at the end.<br /><br />
