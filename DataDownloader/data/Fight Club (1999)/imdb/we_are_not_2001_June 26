When watching &quot;Fight Club&quot;, you realise that this movie is a very twisted
movie. By twisted, I mean that it isn't one of those films you expect
everything to be clearly laid out in front of you in black and white. Very
much like the time I saw &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, I was sitting on the seat
saying
to myself, &quot;So what's the fuss all about?&quot; Ok, the film had just started
so
I had now idea what to expect. But did only agree to watch cause people
fussed about it. The said to me, &quot;Watch it, man! You'll worship it,
afterwards!&quot;<br /><br />And quite predictable, as it seems, &quot;Fight Club&quot; evolved and developed
into
one of the most awe-inspiring films I've witnessed. It oozes with the
essense of a superb film. It follows a plot format that every movie should
follow, beginning with something quite ordinary and turning into a full
blown opera of suberb acting, cinematography, lighting, and story telling.
What also turned the movie into the gem it very much is, is the plot that
is
not so much complex but more taxing on the mind, so it doesn't leave the
viewer like a stunned mullet, much like the absolute huge disappointment
of
&quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998).<br /><br />Edward Norton is perhaps is one the most talented actors of recent times
and
in his recent role in &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; only statisfied thanks to his
contribution to &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Norton plays Jack, our hero, who's life
isn't
going to great at this time. While trying to handle severe sleeping
problems
and attending a post-testicle cancer rehab group on false pretenses, he
meets Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt)who together they start a fight
club, to ease their troubled minds. Brad Pitt churns out a another dazling
performance as the ever so convincing character of Tyler leads Jack into
deeper and deeper trouble.<br /><br />The highlight of the movie is the approach to climax, where everything is
revealed, in perhaps the greatest plot twist ever put to screen (well
almost, though it's up there with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;). David Fincher movies
always have had great plot twists, such as The Game and Se7en. His efforts
as director ensure the beauty of this film and his magic touch leaves that
tingling feeling as the credits begin to roll.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot;, may not be the movie for everyone. It may be too wierd. It
may
be too stupid. It may be that your not the one for those crazy
pscyhcological-plot-twist flicks. For what ever reason you may or may not
enjoy this, it is worth seeing it at least once for the experience. &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is an extremely important landmark as pscyhcological thrillers go.
I'm
very sure &quot;Fight Club&quot; will become a movie classic alongside films like
&quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;, in a era of mind game thrillers.<br /><br />
