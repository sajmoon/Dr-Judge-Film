Edward Norton works in a dead end job, in which he looks at car crashes,
from the fault of his car company. He has a weasel of a boss and is a
chronic insomnic (he never sleeps). He joins discussions of people who are
dying or were. At a Testicular Cancer survivors place he meets Bob
(Meatloaf, a perfect performance) who due to hormone therapy after having
his testicles, has developed b**** tits.<br /><br />On a plane flight back from looking at another car wreck, he meets tyler
durden (Pitt). On returning home Norton finds his place in ruins after an
explosion (director fincher's realistic show of how this happened is
fantastic), so he crashes with durden. after a drink at a bar they are
beating each other to a pulp in the parking lot, and create &quot;fight
club&quot;.<br /><br />before long they have many more members including bob. both norton and
pitt
share a relationship between marla (bonham-carter), in different ways,
pitt
has a very sexual one, where norton cant stand her, but she seems to like
him.<br /><br />only when pitt decides to make &quot;Project Mahem&quot; and split on norton, to
fend
for himself does the film actually make you think... WOW!!!!!!<br /><br />with an unbelievable, unpredictable but absolutely brilliant ending, this
film is both visually and emotionly breathtaking. it is very violent
though,
so it is not for youngsters.<br /><br />a definite 10/10
