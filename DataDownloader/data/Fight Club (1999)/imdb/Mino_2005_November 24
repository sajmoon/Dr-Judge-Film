Palahniuk talks about the modern man who enslaves himself for all the
wrong reasons. The story is a criticism on the consumer-driven world we
are living in, about the ties in our lives which are mostly material,
society, and about our dreams to one day say and do what we mean and
want - it&#x27;s about freedom and a way to achieve it, or at least rebel
against the status quo. The movie is an introspection, and a close and
cynical observation of the exterior world, where we stand in it, It&#x27;s a
glimpse into the reality of things. It&#x27;s smart, and an eye opener.<br /><br />The movie itself is perhaps Fincher&#x27;s best, dark, stylish and brutal.
It made me want to punch certain aspects of my life in the face and in
many ways changed the way I react to things. <br /><br />And by the way, has anyone else seen the multiple subliminal frames in
which Tyler appears before he actually appears? - have you never almost
seen him in your everyday life? Cause I have!
