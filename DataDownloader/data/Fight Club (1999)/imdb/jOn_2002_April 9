What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said already?  I
don't know, I really really really liked this movie, it's simply amazing. 
Pitt and Norton are great and they play off each other brilliantly.  the
cinematography is beautiful and the violence is killer (not literally, but,
well, yeah). It's also got an amazing score (courtesy of the Dust Brothers)
and the Pixies' song &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; during the final scene...
perfect!!! see this movie NOW if you haven't all ready, and see it again
soon if you have... one of the best films ever made!
