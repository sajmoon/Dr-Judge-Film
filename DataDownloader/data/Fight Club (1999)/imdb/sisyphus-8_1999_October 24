1999_October 24 
...Go see this movie. While &quot;Alien&sup3;&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot; were merely
above average, Fincher did impress me considerably with &quot;Seven,&quot; which I
consider to be a masterpiece in its own right. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is every bit as
good as &quot;Seven,&quot; perhaps better. On the surface, it seems pretentious and
adolescent (which it is to an extent...but that's to be expected in a movie
about guys beating the c**p out of each other). But once you get beyond the
shocks his is a movie with a lot to say that pulls out all the stops in
saying it.<br /><br />Although I haven't read the novel (yet), I must say that Uhls' script is
amazingly well-crafted, considering the convoluted nature of the story. As
the angry, enigmatic Tyler Durden, Pitt once again proves that he's at his
best as a psycho (like in another favorite of mine, &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;), and the
chameleon-like Norton delivers another charged, convincing performance. Even
though Carter also gives a good performance  the entire character seems to
disrupt the flow of the story in parts, which is the only real weak point in
the movie.<br /><br />When the smoke clears, &quot;Fight Club&quot; functions as a scathing satire on pretty
much everything status quo. This is more than Kafka for the (post-)MTV
generation, though...it's a genuinely thought-provoking film that is as
darkly funny as it is disturbing.
