What the hell is this fight club thing? I missed much of the hype regarding
it`s release as I was in relationship land and far away from my ethic of
see
2 films a week.<br /><br />I kept seeing it on the rental shelf but, continually passed it over to
catch up on my film backlog once the relationship crashed and burned! I was
a fool! Please forgive me.<br /><br />The first rule about fightclub is you do not talk about fightclub.
Therefore I won`t, and this is really unlike me! I like to rant and rave
about movies I like.<br /><br />This is a cult film. It`s impact is growing. It`s easy to be obsessed with,
easy to be in love with it`s anti-capitalist centiment.<br /><br />What is fightclub? Political, love story, soul searching, it is the hole in
your life.<br /><br />If you were born in any of these decades you must see it immediately; 60`s,
70`s, 80`s.<br /><br />Your children will see this film because it is a classic. Rent it, Buy it,
steal it from a friend but, SEE IT!!! You must be part of this movement. It
will not answer your questions about life. It will not help your love life
but, you will relate to it.<br /><br />Tell no one the ending, tell no one anything about this film other then
they
must see it.  That way they can experience what I experienced when my house
mate finally made me sit down and watch the DVD.<br /><br />I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />And to reassure the girls you, like me can see this film.  You will not
feel
isolated by the male machismo, you will be astounded by it`s intelligence.
(And if that didn`t persuade your girlfriend just tell her Brad Pitt gets
his kit off and has never looked so cute.)<br /><br />My final comment Why are you still sitting in front of your computer? Go
get
the film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
