I absolutely loved this movie!  At the very end I was just sitting in my
seat thinking, &quot;What did I just encounter?&quot;  My brother looked at me and
said, &quot;Did you expect that ending?&quot;  &quot;I had no clue,&quot; was the stunned
reply.<br /><br />I loved it so much that I took my best friend to see it two days later.  I
NEVER see a movie in the theaters twice.  This was an exception.  This
movie
so accurately portrayed how I feel it was almost a documentary.<br /><br />The acting was amazing and I will be quoting that movie till I
die.<br /><br />It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while with a plot twist that
will
leave anyone wondering what just hit them.
