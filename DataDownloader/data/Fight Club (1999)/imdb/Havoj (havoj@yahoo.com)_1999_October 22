1999_October 22 

I'm going to go ahead and join the majority of reviewers by pushing this
movie.  It is definitely one of my favorites this year.  The plot twists are
incredible, and Norton gives the performance of the year!  It is arguable
better than the one given in American History X, and deserves to be
nominated for another Oscar this year.  Norton and Pitt's performances are
reason enough to see this film.<br /><br />I went into the movie expecting a repeat of what I saw on the previews.
What I got was a movie that delves into the minds of twisted, complex
characters.  Fincher does such a wonderful job laying out the story... there
is never a point in the movie where I thought that time was wasted.  What I
really loved about the movie was its look.  It had dark imagery all through
the film, which the soundtrack contributed to.  Besides from that, the
visual effects were utterly convincing, and I'm sure they will leave many
viewers squeamish.  They were so convincing, in fact, that many viewers will
be unable to look past the violence and see the genius in this film.<br /><br />Fight Club was well worth the ticket price.
