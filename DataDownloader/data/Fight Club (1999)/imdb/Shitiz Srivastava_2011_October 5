Why I like this movie? I don&#x27;t know but right from the first scene it
just keeps me with it and i want to watch it till end. I love
everything about this film; editing, acting, direction, cinematography,
sound and everything. Brad Pitt truly emerges as champion of this film
when Edward Norton leaves you with open mouth. Based on a novel by
Chuck Pahlunick, this movie has everything that i wanted my movie to
had if i ever made one. The reason why i love this psycho thriller
movie is its fast paced story movement and camera work. My favorite
scene is when Norton is hugged by a fat man and inner conflicts of his
mind are going in the narration, it is awesomely pictured and acted
upon. You get interested in the plot with every moving second and feel
like you have become a pat of their world.<br /><br />A must watch for every one. Truly recommended.
