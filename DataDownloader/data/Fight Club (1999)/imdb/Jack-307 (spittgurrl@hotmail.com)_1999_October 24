1999_October 24 

This was an amazing movie. I've been a huge fan of Edward Norton since I saw
Primal Fear years ago.  He's an incredible actor with more talent than most
veterans of this genre.  Though I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, I
enjoyed seeing him in this role because he was more than just a pretty face.
In fact, for most of this movie his face was far from pretty.  Both men are
great at what they do.<br /><br />There was so much more to this movie than met the eye. It kept me both
perplexed an intrigued throughout the entire film.  Thankfully, there was
humor in the movie, but it was the kind that made me feel bad for laughing
at it.  After I laughed, I looked guiltily around the theater to see if
anyone else had enjoyed the satirical humor as I had.  Few people did, but
then, few people would fully appreciate this movie.<br /><br />The ending was only a bit of a disappointment.  But after that movie, any
ending would have been a disappointment.  I'm just thankful that it didn't
end with Jack fighting Tyler in some sort of duel to the death, which would
have completely falsified the point to the movie with a juvenile portrayal
of good versus evil.  With the ending as is, Jack found the battle had to be
fought within himself. Something more universal, but less believable, the
way it was brought up.<br /><br />At one point in the film I felt that the idea had gotten away from the
writer, and it was losing its meaning, but the film redeemed itself with the
way Norton's character reacted to the situation. Overall I was severely
pleased with the entire work. I left the theater confused, but
satisfied.
