1999 was a big year for films. There was The Matrix, The 6th Sense,
Something about Mary, The Phantom Meanace and The Mummy. Maybe not the most
notcible to the public but probaly the best was Fight Club. Becasue of its
18 rating it didnt get to much attention at cinemas, but dont let the
violent theme put you off, its an amazing film and once you have seen it
once, it will be a different film the sencond time round. The film is about
Jack, who is fed up with his life. He starst going to suport groups for
people with testictular cancer so he can talk to people. He meets Tyler
Durden, who sells soap. When Jacks condo is desroyed Tyler introduces Jack
to a new way of life. They start fighting outside a bar for fun and Jack
then truley feels alive. They start their own club in which people fight so
they too can escape their lives. But Tyler has a greater purpose for fight
club. This a great film and i advise everyone who is not weak hearted to
see
it<br /><br />5/5
