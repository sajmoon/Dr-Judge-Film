1999_December 23 
.....and I'm seeing everything in a new way. This is going to be
regarded
years down the road as a very important film, not only for it's acting,
writing, and directing, but for it's sheer and blunt honest truth. Forget
all of this talk about, &quot;Is it too violent?&quot; No, it isn't. The reason they
(the government/media jack-offs) didn't want you to see it is because of
the
truth that it told. And the anarchy that they thought that it would
cause.
This is a perfect film. Well, almost perfect. There was one line in the
film
that made me cringe (the whole lead salad comment). Other than that, it was
beautiful.
