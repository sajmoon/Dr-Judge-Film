Don&acute;t listen to people telling you this movie is bad. Since those people
saying that probably didn`t understand it. EITHER YOU LOVE IT OR HATE IT
it&acute;s as simple as that. This is not your classical action-movie where you
know how the film will end before the movie starts.<br /><br />Story:
Its about a man (Edward Norton) being bored at being a slave under the
system. So he starts going to meetings for people that are terminally ill
just to see that someone has a worse life than him. But one day he meets
Tyler (Brad Pitt) and they start a club where people can fight each
other,
the fighting is not for glory or something like that its just because
they
want to do something different, lose some aggressions etc.. the club
grows
big and they get hundreds (thousands) of members all over the USA. So
they
start giving the members missions to get back at the commercialism in the
world..<br /><br />But its a lot more complex then that and i&acute;m not so good at English so i
cant write what i really want to say.<br /><br />I give it 10 out of 10. The best movie i`ve ever seen.
