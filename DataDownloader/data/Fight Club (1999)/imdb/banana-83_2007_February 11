&quot;Azygophrenia&quot; is a mental condition stemming from living a lonely,
single life. It may manifest in different ways. <br /><br />The Fight Club grows from the twisted loneliness of Ed Norton&#39;s
character. it grows huge, then starts to get out of control. It&#39;s a
complex, awesome movie showing the explosion than can happen when
conformity leads to extreme internalized anger. Hint: Humans are not
meant to live in tiny boxes. They do not find fulfillment in furnishing
their entire lives with other peoples stuff or living according to a
pre-written script.<br /><br />This is a male movie, as far from a chick flick as you can get. Women
could benefit from it if they want to understand the kind of
frustrations guys feel regarding their egos and finding meaning and
excitement in life.
