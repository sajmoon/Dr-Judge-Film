1999_November 29 

After a slow start to the movie (excluding the plane crash scene) this
film
really got going. You find yourself feeling sorry for Edward Norton's
character, then you are amused by him, and then you really wish you were
in
Fight Club so you could pan his face in. The way that the emotions in all
of
the characters change throughout the film is very well written. This movie
has the second biggest twist that I have seen in recent months (no prizes
for guessing the other one) although I feel that the end of the movie did
drag on a little too long. Final Verdict: Second best of the year (next to
Sixth Sense)
