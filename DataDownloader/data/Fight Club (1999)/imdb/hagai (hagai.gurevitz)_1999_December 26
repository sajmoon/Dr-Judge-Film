what a rush.
DAVID FINCHER has done it again. i haven't had that kind of feeling after
a
movie for a long time. FINCHER had successfully created the ultimate had
rush for those who can handle the task.
it is by far one of the most interesting, violent, weird, and disgusting
movie i have ever seen. EDWARD NORTON and BRAD PITT are excellent as the
founders of the fight club, a club that offer his members more then a
saturday night recreation and begin for them an altornetive way of life,
life on the brim of society where the normal behavior and standard no
longer
exist. BUT DONT kid yourself, the movie is a lot more then the fights
themself, a whole set of event, some unbelievable some plane loony, lead
to
the unavoidable end, maybe the end of us all.
GO AND SEE.
