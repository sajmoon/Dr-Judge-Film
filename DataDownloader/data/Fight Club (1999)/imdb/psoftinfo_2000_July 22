Brilliant.  Just totally, utterly brilliant.  When the credits were rolling
at the end, I simply sat there stunned.<br /><br />I thought I was renting a fantasy about men &quot;finding&quot; themselves.  I
actually got it simply because I hadn't seen it before and figured it might
be good for a laugh.  I had no idea that it would be so deep, asking so many
questions and keeping me both baffled and entranced.<br /><br />If ever there was an example of &quot;Don't judge a book (or DVD) by its cover&quot;,
this is surely it.  If you think you know what this film is about ... my
first rule here is:  don't ask any questions.  Just see
it!
