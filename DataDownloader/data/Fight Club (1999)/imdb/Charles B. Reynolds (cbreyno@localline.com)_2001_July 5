I like and admire this film. It is a movie of ideas. It is actually three
separate movies.<br /><br />One movie is a dark adventure story (testosterone opera) very engaging in
its own way.  An unhappy fellow living in an empty world tries to master
his
fate.<br /><br />One movie is a gripping psychological study of personality disintegration.
Edward Nortons' character is searching, ever searching for something
unaware
that it is his own identity being sought after.<br /><br />One movie is an Anarchist Tract: A Call To Arms! Remember If?  In this
movie
we see an implementation of the idea that for a new, better order to exist
the old one must be destroyed.  Look for a happy face in an unexpected
place.  The thing that is missing in this movie is the Anarchist vision of
the better world to come (Utopia).<br /><br />Aside from the intellectual side Fight Club has tremendous energy.  It will
carry you away.  At least it did me.<br /><br />Brad Pitt has a taste for fascinating films:  Fight Club, 12
Monkeys.<br /><br />
