While I used to consider this movie to be my #1 pick, that has shifted to
magnolia.
The movie is still good, and I like it just as much as
before.
However after reading the book, it just seems flat.  Life is a series of
comparisons, and while comparing this movie to other movies it's #1, but
comparing this movie to other messages that I find through media, it's not,
simply because the book's message is way better, with a lot more depth. 
Fight club was #1 in my book due to its original meaning but now that I
found this meaning expanded upon in another medium, fight club has
shrunk.
There is just a lot more to it.  A lot.  I don't think the characters,
especially Marla, are well developed.  Upon seeing the movie for the first
time I had a feeling like Marla was supposed to be a big part of it, but she
wasn't.  From the start he even says &quot;all this is because of marla&quot; or
something like that.  But in fact, it wasn't really expanded upon at
all.
There were a lot of other things too, the whole #69 thing was rather
pointless.  And just little things throughout.
I'd still give it a 10/10 for sure, I would just recommend reading the book
over watching the movie (but doing both works too).
