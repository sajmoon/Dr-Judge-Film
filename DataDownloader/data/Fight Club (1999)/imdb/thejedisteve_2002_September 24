This film has everything it is a stomach twisting gut wrenching roller
coaster of a movie with the best twist in moviedom EVER!!!
Career best performances by Norton and Pitt, Possibly the most important
Movie of my generation where it typifies everything that is wrong with
culture today and provides the most ingenious way to rectify.
