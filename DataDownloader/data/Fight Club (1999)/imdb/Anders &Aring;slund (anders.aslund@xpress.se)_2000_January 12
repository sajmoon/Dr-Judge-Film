This is the 3rd best film I've ever seen. Fast-moving, energetic beyond
belief and with a rock-solid attitude that just isn't found elsewhere, this
flick is just too great to miss. Unsettling, graphic, violent like no else,
made in typical Fincher-style: dark, gritty, dirty and a bucketful of sweat.
Excellent performances by Pitt and Norton (the IKEA touch is a bonus for us
Swedes), great lines (&quot;Run, Forrest, run!&quot; is my favorite) and some really,
REALLY wicked jokes.
I recommend this film to anyone, except that you have to bear watching
people slug it out some - and even beating each others' faces to bloody
pulp. But the violence is not the point of this film, and if you can stand
it, there are quite a few interesting issues that are brought to attention.
And what more can one ask for?
