While watching this I thought I was watching one of the most important films
of modern times, a film that was going to deliver a message about the value
of fighting, but then a really tacked-on ending threw a cloud over
everything I'd seen up until then and I knew this was one that would sadly
fade away into obscurity as merely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />I was genuinely taken by surprise by The Sixth Senses surprise ending, one
that made me think &quot;that's pretty clever, it all makes sense now&quot;, but I was
angered at how cheap the surprise ending was in Fight Club, it cheapened
what could have been a powerful piece of social commentary.
I rate it four out of five stars because most of the film is top-notch, and
Fight Club should be seen by any regular moviegoer at least
once.
