Okay, so the acting and the overall production was top-drawer, but
absolutely nothing can overcome one of the most ridiculous storylines I have
ever come across. I put this movie in the same category as David
Cronenberg's &quot;Crash&quot;, in that they both are obsessed with concepts so
contrary to basic human nature, that they are totally inane and
unbelievable. In &quot;Crash&quot;, it is absurd to think there are really people who
are sexually turned-on by bad car crashes; in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, it is ridiculous
to believe that there are people who enjoy getting pumelled. Thoughts of
such concepts leave me so cold as to take away any possibility of enjoying
the film.
