<br /><br />It is another landmark in the movie history!!!  David Fincher did a wonder
by uncovering one of the deepest and the most basic human natures and
enlightened us by putting it onto the screen with startling visual and sound
effect. He obviously does not have a touch of faith in human nature, which
has been displayed in Seven. 
Fight club begins with Jack's monologue showing the evolution of
Fight club until his encounter with Tyler, a soap maker, on a plane.As
the movie goes on, we audience gradually are engaged in Tyler's world,
where every member of fight club finds a new relief and themselves in a
revolutionary way. As the end draws on, the whole intriguing plot reveals.
As usual, David never gives us a happy ending. An inevitable total
destruction ensues after Jack shot himself.
Besides the delicately--plotted story line, the editing is also smashing
enough to make John Woo flush.Furthermore,the cast is quiet
suitable.
Edward Norton again proves his versatile acting skill for various
characters by playing Jack, a mentally suffering person suffering who are
deeply involved in the illusion to set himself free and then tries to save
the world from terror organized by himself. Helena Bonham,despite her
delicious performances in many British films, delivers a quiet good job as
Marla Singer, a crazy and wanton woman.<br /><br />Finally,There is no denying that it is controversial for people now, but it
is bound to be a masterpiece which deserves a permanent place in the human
history!!!
