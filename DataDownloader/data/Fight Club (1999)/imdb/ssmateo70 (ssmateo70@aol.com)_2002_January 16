Fight club is not about fighting. It's about violence, commercialism,
reality, and so many other things. It's about anarchy, disorder, and, yes,
even soap. The movie works on so many levels. There isn't a second in this
movie where I was bored. Some movies have weak spots or a scene that takes
away from the film. Fight club doesn't suffer from that. Every character,
every line of dialogue, and every scene in the movie is so interesting and
clever. The performances are awesome, David Fincher does an amazing job as
well (can't wait for his next). A great movie that is about more than just
fighting and violence and yet revolves entirely around those two things.
9/10
