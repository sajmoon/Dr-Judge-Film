Ignore the small-brained carpers. Fight Club is the most visceral and
intelligent film that mainstream Hollywood has produced in a long time.<br /><br />The film, for anyone who has just arrived from another planet and hasn't
heard of it, attempts to address the issues of how a lost generation of
men
can restore meaning to lives, which are being controlled by advertising
propaganda and fascistic little men in suits. It is about addiction and
rehabilitation; imprisonment and freedom; control and insanity.<br /><br />Easily David Fincher's best movie, combining the darkness of Se7en and the
elaborateness of The Game in a weirdly optimistic and grotty fusion.
Squalor has never seemed so liberating.
A message to all those conservatives who decry it: it's you who needs to
grow up. There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in
your philosophy.
&quot;I say never be complete. I say let's evolve. Let the chips fall where
they
may.&quot; - Tyler Durden
