It's unusual when one of your top 5 movies of all time happens to be only 2
years old... and that movie needs to have REALLY made an impact on you.
Fight Club enters the ranks alongside The Godfather and Citizen Kane as one
of those movies which not only makes you sit up and take notice, but, as
with the other two previously mentioned films, leaves you walking away from
the cinema looking at life as you probably never have before. This is a
difficult statement for anyone born before the 1960's to comprehend, for two
reasons: first, the pre-60s generation by default have NO clue as to what
the message of the film concerns- it is solely aimed at anyone between the
age of 24-35; and second, in their eyes, the movie portrays negative
propaganda with regards to the society we now live in, as well as simply
being a movie filled with unnecessary violence with the 'negative' tone
acting as a backdrop.<br /><br />If you are between 24-35 and reading this, do yourself a favour and watch
Fight Club. It WILL open your eyes to your life. Unfortunately for my
generation, we do live a lifestyle where the label on the back of our jeans,
in our eyes, defines us as a certain type of person. Eventually, after
slogging our guts out in jobs which go against our conscience in many cases,
jobs which reduce intelligent young men into vegetables, we believe that the
only way to counter-balance this is to create an artificial lifestyle which
temporarily provides us with a feeling of inner well-being, until it gets
bad again, in which case we find other ways to 'upgrade' ourselves.<br /><br />Whether, as the film portrays, fighting is the solution to this generational
problem, is upto the individual to decide after having watched the film. One
thing is for certain, though. I am totally unsurprised by the comments of
so-called 'expert' critics such as Kenneth Thuran of the LA Times, who
completely missed the zeitgeist of the movie, and the numerous messages it
carries. I also believe that Fight Club is a  movie which may or may not be
understood the first time by everyone who needs to watch it, but it will be
one day. Watch Fight Club now and try and get yourself into motion, or watch
it in 20 years' time and get depressed.<br /><br />On the point of violence, I do appreciate the fact that the level of
violence portrayed in the movie may disturb some viewers. However, firstly,
the level of violence is justified and required for the film to make the
necessary impact. Secondly, where were the anti-violence lobby when
Braveheart and Gladiator were released (both movies I am fond of)?<br /><br />This is a movie which will be truly respected and appreciated after ten
years, when people will notice how precise a reflection it was of
generation-x. Well done to Fincher, Pitt and Norton for ensuring that the
movie hit home in the most explosive way. Its purpose was, after all, to
create waves, which, I'm glad to say, it has. From round-table pub
discussions to walking into work without your tie, Fight Club has already
made its mark. 10 out of 10.
