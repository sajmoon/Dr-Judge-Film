Fight Club is not described as an actionfilm. Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and
Terminator are action films. Its not a thriller. Sliver, Diabolique and
Disclosure are thrillers. What is this movie?<br /><br />We have no word for it. But the one thing that seperates it from all other
kinds of movies is the pulse. In almost all other films, which are natural
to compare this movie to, there is a linear action-curve. This film is like
a three dimensional pulse that does not fit into any curve. Its
breath-taking.<br /><br />Many of the ideas that are presented here, have been introduced before. Our
controlled way of life, with Things as the ultimate goal, was also nicely
put in Trainspotting. But in that movie they didn't finish the thought,
ending up in a dumb robbery. This film goes all the way. And the ideas about
our need to fight, need to be open, need not to know persons, not to care,
need for cures and espescially the general thoughts about are society. The
themes of this film is what great writers like Ibsen would have put his
finger on if he lived today. This is the film of who we are, and who we want
to be.<br /><br />It goes all the way. I'd like to compare with Dead Poets Societys message of
Carpe Diem. Yeah, we understood the basic idea of it after that movie, but
it didn't challenge the audience to do it now! Fight Club doesn't just put
it right in your face, it smashes your face into it as well.<br /><br />Its the best action-thriller-90's kind of nonamegenre film I've ever seen.
Which makes it the coolest film of the century. Thank you David
Fincher.
