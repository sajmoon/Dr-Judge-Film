1999_December 11 

Holy crap! What an amazing film! From the beginning mind boggling shot (the
whole thing with the nose) to the superb ending (and i don't just mean the
twist), this film goes from strength to strength. Cinematically, i don't
think i have seen a film that utilises the camera as amazingly as this one.<br /><br />Also, the comments it makes on loss of male identity, commercialism and
consumerism are so poignant that you will be psycho-analysing your freinds
and their roles in society for at least a week after you've watched the
film.
WARNING: you may feel like hitting something after seeing it.
GRRR!!!
