This movie is absolutely the best one I've ever seen. It doesn't have only
good characters and people to act them but it also has a great story with
an
excellent ending. As the name Fight Club tells it has fighting in it so
it's
stupid to judge the movie because of the violence. The fact is if an actor
like Stallone would have starred it there would have been much more
violence.
Fighting gives only the settings to things that really happen in the film.
I
don't find the movie as an action film. It's much more than
that.
