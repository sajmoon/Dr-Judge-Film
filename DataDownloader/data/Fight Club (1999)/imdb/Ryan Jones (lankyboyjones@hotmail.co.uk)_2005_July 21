The film is fantastically directed and created as was Seven also
directed by David Fincher. You couldn't have hoped to have a better
cast. Each actor has obviously been carefully selected to play each
role. Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden plays his part so cool, and i don't
think anyone can not be jealous of how he can carry off any look with
ease and not really care about anything. Also Edward Norton as Jack, He
plays this part so well, he looks really panicky and nervous just as
the character should be played perfectly. This is really a brilliant
movie and it sounds sad but if you look into it deeply enough, it can
change your perspective on how you look at life.
