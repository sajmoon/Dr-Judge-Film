This movie was so great it is too hard to explain in words. Incredible
acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt gives his best role ever. This
movie is one of those movies, that you just can&#39;t forget, thats what
makes it such a great movie.<br /><br />There is the occasional movie that is fun to watch, and some are very
powerful and make you cry, but why this movie is a lot better than all
of those is that it changes the way you look at life. This movie makes
you think about your life and has role models in it. After watching it,
you just want to be like Tyler Durden, because Brad Pitt just makes him
look so damn cool by his deliverance of lines and acting. A must watch.
