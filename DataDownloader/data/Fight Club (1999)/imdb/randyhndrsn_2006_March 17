Fight club is awesome, and it is one of the coolest movies i have ever
seen in my life and the reasons are.Awesome acting, cool scenes,
wonderful twists, the narration is great and the effects are nice to.I
did not know the movie was gonna be the way it was, it had so much to
it and was just such a cool movie that i watched it 2 times in 2 days
and i wanna watch it again.This is my kinda movie, the only reason i do
not give it a 10 is because it was not perfect, it needed more story
then it had.And even though i like long movies, i think they did not
have enough in this movie to make it as long as it was but it starts
out great.The end is one of the best ends to a movie that i have ever
seen, brad Pitt's part is well known but i preferred Edward Norton's
acting in this movie.I have a certain taste of movies, and this movie
was exactly what i want to see and is close to a perfect 10, but i just
could not say it was perfect.I say this movie is worth buying, and most
definitely worth watching more then once, so i say check out fight
club.
