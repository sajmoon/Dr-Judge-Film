I saw Fight Club some time last year and it instantly became my favorite
movie of all time.  One of the most compelling and intelligently written
stories to come out of a Hollywood production ..........EVER!!  This rates
higher than Pulp Fiction or Se7en for me and that's saying a lot.  This and
American History X really made me see Edward Norton in a different light.<br /><br /> I don't want to ruin it for you but suffice to say it's on of the best
twist endings ever.  Should you see it, I also recommend picking up the book
as it explains more about project mayhem and provides a completely different
ending but one just as satisfying.<br /><br /> I don't want to make this review too long so I will close with this.  If
you see one new movie this year, make it Fight Club.  You won't be
disappointed.
