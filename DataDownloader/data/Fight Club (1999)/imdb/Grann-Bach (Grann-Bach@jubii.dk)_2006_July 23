I haven&#39;t read the novel, nor do I know how good this is compared to
it, but the author has said that this made him ashamed of the book,
which can only really be a positive thing in this case. It&#39;s quite
difficult to comment on this without giving something essential away.
Being a fan of David Fincher and having heard nothing but positive
reviews for this film, I eventually bought it. Having just finished it,
it&#39;s hard to determine what to think of it. I had kind of heard the
twist already, and I picked up on many of the hints towards it, so that
had less(but still some) effect on me... I urge anyone who is even
considering watching this to forget everything they&#39;ve heard about it,
look at no promotional material and just get, borrow or rent a copy of
it and see it for yourself, without trying to figure out how it&#39;s going
to end. The plot is intelligent, and very stylishly told. The whole
production has an edge to it, but doesn&#39;t come off as pretentious. The
satire and critique in the movie is smart, but it should perhaps be
noted that no arguments are presented for the opposing view. The acting
is all excellent. The visuals are slick and often undeniably
disturbing. The whole thing has a rather dark tone. The cinematography
is grand. The soundtrack fits like a glove for every scene. The dialog
is clever and in-your-face. I&#39;ve heard it said that this inspires
anarchy and violence... that may be. But just because art is
misunderstood does not mean it should not be made. Creative expression
is one of the few things that make man great. Magnificent work, Mr.
Fincher... keep it up. 10/10
