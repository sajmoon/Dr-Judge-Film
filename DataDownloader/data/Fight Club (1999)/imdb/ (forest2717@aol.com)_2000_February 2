I have read the book and seen the film.  To summarize the film, brilliant.
To summarize the book, brilliant.  Each medium has cast an unfavorable light
on society that has not been seen since Kubrick's Clockwork Orange.  Fight
Club gives us a look into the minds of more than just the characters, but
into the minds of most people of this generation.  What we have witnessed is
an illustration of what our generation despises,  commercially saturated
America. How it can try to mold and shake us until we are shadows of our
former selves. For the creation of this filmic masterpiece we can thank two
people,
Chuck Palahniuk and the ever incredible David Fincher.
