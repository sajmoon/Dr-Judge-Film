1999_October 24 

This movie was not what I expected, which was in itself part of the fun. It
took many different turns, and left me replaying scene after scene in my
head long after I left the theater.<br /><br />I left the movie feeling that this was some of the most fun that I have had
at a film in a long, long time.  It blends comedy, drama, and action
perfectly. The dialogue is terrific and the overall writing is genius. The
only downside is that it does drag in a couple of places but it's nothing
that can't be tolerated.<br /><br />Edward Norton proves once again that he is one of the best actors of the
'90's.<br /><br />
