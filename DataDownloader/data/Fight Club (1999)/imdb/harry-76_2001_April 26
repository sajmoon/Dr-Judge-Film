&quot;The Fight Club&quot; attempts to dramatize the frustrations of modern man caught
up in routine and unfulfilling jobs . . . and ways in which this &quot;pent-up
steam&quot; can be released through violent male bonding.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the scripters got caught up in their own outrageous
creations, taking their points to an ultimate extreme and ridiculous
conclusion.<br /><br />Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter all give admirable
performances.<br /><br />
