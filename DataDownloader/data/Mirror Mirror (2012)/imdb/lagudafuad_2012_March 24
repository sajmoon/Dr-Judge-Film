Mirror Mirror, takes a while getting into, but after you get over the
first 40 mins the movie isn&#x27;t that bad.<br /><br />The comedy did hit home and I rather found the movie funny than
intriguing.<br /><br />Mirror Mirror is a shy away from great, but the screenplay was well
carved, yes you are watching Snow White and the Seven dwarfs, but it
felt different. I guess the main reason it was fun to watch was the
difference in the way things played out.<br /><br />Snow was supposed to be saved by the prince, but in this Jason Keller
(Machine Gun Preacher) tale the prince was the one needing saving.<br /><br />I was so impressed by the screen write by Jason Keller that I spent
majority of time being captivated by the turn of events, than the
events itself. Directed by Indian director Tarsem Singh, who also
directed The Cell (2000) and Immortals (2011), Mirror Mirror to me was
good because of the screenplay and script rather than the directing.
Not saying directing isn&#x27;t important but you have to see this movie for
yourself to understand.<br /><br />It&#x27;s been long since I have seen anything done by Julia Roberts, but
this wasn&#x27;t a disappointment and her acting showed why she is and will
always remain one of the best things that happened to the silver
screen.<br /><br />The plot is the same is based on &#x27;Snow White&#x27; by the Brothers Grimm and
stars Lily Collins (Phil Collins daughter and also starred in
Abduction) as snow White and Julia Roberts as the evil queen.<br /><br />All in all, go watch it.<br /><br />www.lagsreviews.com
