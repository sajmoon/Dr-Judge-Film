MIRROR, MIRROR is a fantasy adventure movie adaptation of the fairy
tale SNOW WHITE (AND THE SEVEN Dwarfs) It&#x27;s directed by Tarsem Singh,
who directed &#x22;The Cell&#x22;, &#x22;The Fall&#x22; and &#x22;Immortals&#x22;, and stars Lily
Collins as Snow White, the ever-funny Nathan Lane, Armie Hammer, and
Julia Roberts as the wickedly amusing Evil Queen.<br /><br />This movie is something that has a little too many of almost everything
you can get from a movie that promises pure fun and entertainment. It&#x27;s
got funny bandit dwarfs, evil magic, a monster that haunts the forest,
and swashbuckling action. It is one of those movies where all the
elements of the movie work so harmoniously. From the acting, to the
lavish and pleasantly bizarre costumes, to the special effects, the
concept, the story, and the direction itself. All these factors
complement each other to create such an enjoyable masterpiece.<br /><br />Lily Collins is so effortlessly adorable and so natural, that she does
not look like she&#x27;s acting at all; she just simply is cute. My favorite
scenes with her is when she joined with the bandit dwarfs; I loved it
when she was doing some swashbuckling action, because even though she&#x27;s
wielding a sword, somehow she still maintains that very princess-like
poise.<br /><br />Nathan Lane is ever amusing, Armie Hammer is great in playing a prince
who goes through non-stereotypical circumstances, and all the dwarfs
played by Mark Povinelli, Danny Woodburn, Jordan Prentice, Ronald Lee
Clark, Sebastian Saraceno, Martin Klebba, and Joe Gnoffo were all
hilariously amazing to watch, and they were pretty much my favorite
characters in the movie.<br /><br />And then there&#x27;s Julia Roberts who played the evil Queen Clementianna.
This time, as she plays the villain, and looks like she&#x27;s deliciously
enjoying every moment of it. She does give the role more than enough
spice. Her hilarious wickedness, with great little twisted lines, and
the degree of wit she personally delivers to the role are precious
cinematic moments that make this movie so fun to watch.<br /><br />That one song attached with the movie, which is being played at the end
credits of the movie; I really have to say that that is a stupid song.
But the movie is so good and so effective, that it got me playing that
song in my head over and over again hours after the movie.<br /><br />MIRROR, MIRROR&#x27;s script is excellently-written; so rich with wit. Its
script makes it more comedy than fairy tale. The movie preserves the
essence of the original, but injects new elements to make it more
timeless and interesting. Granted, there might be unexpected changes,
but it all works in the context of the story, and it&#x27;s not as drastic
as to completely change the feel of the source material (like what they
did in the other movie where they made Snow White look like an
iron-clad Conan the Barbarian) The costumes are so lavish, stylish, and
positively weird; it makes you feel like you are watching a music video
from Bjork. The movie&#x27;s genre is not centered only for one demographic,
as it also has some action on it; what with the swashbuckling bandits,
and the gigantic creatures sent by the Queen to kill Snow White, there
are sword-fights and awesome action scenes to balance out the comedy
and the fantasy.<br /><br />MIRROR, MIRROR is perfectly fun-filled, and quirkily weird in a very
positive manner. This is the kind of movie that can give you a big
smile even hours after you&#x27;ve seen the movie!
