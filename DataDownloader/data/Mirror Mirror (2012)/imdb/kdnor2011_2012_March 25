When I saw the trailer for this movie, I just thought it would be
absolutely horrible. The dwarfs looked annoying,and Julia Roberts
seemed annoying. So after seeing it, is it as bad as I thought it would
be. Well no, it&#x27;s just really boring.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s start with the good stuff. It&#x27;s looks pretty good. The colors
against the snow work really well. The set designs are great, and at
times the special effects look pretty cool. And Julia Roberts looks
likes she&#x27;s having a lot of fun. She is so ridiculously evil and does
get a funny line now and then. And Nathan Lane can also make a funny
line once in a while.<br /><br />But the stuff I don&#x27;t like, it isn&#x27;t that funny. The seven dwarfs
aren&#x27;t as annoying as I thought they would be, but they didn&#x27;t make me
laugh once. Like I said, Roberts and Lane make a funny line once in a
while, but that&#x27;s it. A lot of the characters are annoying. Some scenes
don&#x27;t make any sense. And maybe this is just me, but what is up with
Snow White&#x27;s eyebrows, she&#x27;s hot, but those eyebrows are huge. Really,
the big reason this movie didn&#x27;t work for me is that it was boring, the
action isn&#x27;t interesting, I didn&#x27;t care about the relationship between
Snow White and the Prince, and like I said, it isn&#x27;t really that funny.<br /><br />This movie isn&#x27;t quite as bad as I thought it would be, but part of me
wishes it was, then at least it would have gotten an emotional response
out of me.<br /><br />3.5/10
