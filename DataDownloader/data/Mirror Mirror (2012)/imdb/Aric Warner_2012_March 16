While this film seems to be perfectly tailored for some audiences, most
discerning viewers will find Mirror Mirror to be lacking depth. Several
plot fixtures are left unexplained, and in general this movie feels
like the writers are trying to shove as many fantasy clich&#xE9;s into one
movie as they can. The movie would undoubtedly have been better had the
writers simply stuck to the original story, but they did not. The
deviation from the classic story was not well done, and in many ways,
it did not make much sense. <br /><br />On a positive note, the acting was refreshingly good, particularly on
the part of Julia Roberts. Roberts played the sinister queen quite
excellently, adding a seething sarcasm to each line. Along with the
acting, the aesthetics were good. Makeup could have been better, but
costuming was very well done, and it played a large part in making the
movie coherent. <br /><br />In short, the positive qualities of this film were not nearly enough to
make up for the awkward timing, unexplained plot mechanisms, mediocre
dialogue, and unworkable mixture of different fantasy clich&#xE9;s. My
suggestion is that you go see something else.
