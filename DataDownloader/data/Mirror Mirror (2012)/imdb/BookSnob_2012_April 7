When I saw the trailer for Mirror Mirror, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I
wasn&#x27;t even planning on watching it, and totally dismissed it based on
the trailer. Snow White and the Huntsman looked more my speed. However,
I have three baby sisters who saw the trailer and basically said, I
WILL DIE IF I DON&#x27;T SEE THIS. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, short guy jokes and
Julia Roberts aging? No thanks. Anyway, my sisters dragged me to see
it, and I have to say, I FREAKIN&#x27; LOVED IT. <br /><br />It wasn&#x27;t all shallow age jokes, didn&#x27;t really have any short people
jokes, the Prince (Armie Hammer) was cute, and it was intelligent. So
smart and witty, I loved it. It wasn&#x27;t shallow, there wasn&#x27;t any
singing, no sugary oh-right-I-think-my-eyes-just-rolled-down-the-aisle
moments. Each dwarf had like, their own individual personality and
depth, not the cardboard cutouts to provide comedic relief I expected.
This isn&#x27;t a people version of Walt Disney&#x27;s 1937 Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs, which I found charming but shallow, Mirror Mirror finds
it&#x27;s own path taking the same basic plot (evil/jealous
stepmother/queen, young beautiful girl, dwarfs , etc.) and turning it
into something else. Something witty and wonderful. I really loved it.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t judge this one by it&#x27;s trailer.
