This is a light-hearted fairytale that I think children will enjoy
(adults, not so much). I do have to give big props to Tarsem Singh who
once again has created a visual explosion on the big screen. Also, the
fact that the writers provided a new line of work for the seven dwarfs
did enhance the story. I am almost sure that no one wants to see seven
little people going to the mines every day. Had it not been for the
dwarfs, this film would have lost most of its appeal. I really would
have liked to have seen a little more character development of the
seven dwarfs because they were all very endearing. After all, the
original story was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, not Snow
White and the Witch. But that being said, Julia Roberts (the Queen) did
make a convincing (and funny) evil person along with her sidekick,
Nathan Lane (Brighton). I bet you that Julia has not had this much fun
making a film in a very long time. I can see why she took the part. As
far as Nathan goes, he is always fun to watch and this film was
definitely not a stretch for him at all. The few hilarious moments in
this film were silly and fun, but some young people might not get all
the jokes. It is like the design of the film was made for children, but
the dialog was written for grown folks and I don&#x27;t think that the film
ever reached a happy medium. The silliness of the fact that Arnie
Hammer (Prince Alcott) turns into a puppy (depicted in the trailer) was
bordering on nauseating. It just dragged on too long. Lily Collins
(Snow White) fit into the role perfectly. She even looks a little like
the cartoon (this is a complement). I do have to say that I was
pleasantly surprised (mildly) at the ending and I really enjoyed the
dancing when the credits were rolling. I think that children between
the ages of seven and twelve might enjoy this film. Anyone older or
younger would probably not enjoy it as much. I didn&#x27;t hate the film and
I didn&#x27;t nod off, so I say if you are just looking to get out of the
house and you&#x27;ve seen all the other films that are showing, go and see
it. I am giving this film an amber light.
