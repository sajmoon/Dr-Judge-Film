When you hear Snow White today your mind automatically goes to the
Disney version made way back in 1937. This is not the Disney version of
the story. In both content and atmosphere this is much closer (with
some dramatic licence taken) to the original story from the Brothers
Grimm. In that sense, it&#x27;s probably worthy of a look see, and it might
surprise a few people who are expecting a kind of live action version
of the Disney cartoon. Mind you, it still has very much a comic
undertone to it, but it&#x27;s a rather dark movie, at times even violent,
and with some frightening material revolving around &#x22;the beast&#x22; that
younger children might find disturbing.<br /><br />I confess that I&#x27;m not a big fan of Julia Roberts. She plays the evil
Queen in this movie. She was all right. I have no particular criticism.
For whatever reason, she just doesn&#x27;t hit home with me. As Snow White
we had a young actress named Lily Collins. She handled the part
reasonably well. Snow White is an interesting character in this. A
princess locked away by the evil Queen, who escapes the castle and
hooks up with a group of seven dwarf bandits in the woods, and who then
becomes committed to taking back her father&#x27;s kingdom. Snow White is a
strong character - her strength developing as the movie progresses.
Collins did well portraying that. The highlight of the cast for me,
though, was Nathan Lane as Brighton, the Queen&#x27;s right hand man. As
he&#x27;s always able to do, Lane injected a good sense of fun into the
story and was enjoyable to watch. There were a number of funny scenes
scattered throughout, and that was necessary to get out from under the
darkness at the movie&#x27;s base. I found that a number of other scenes,
though, were somewhat overdone - most of the fight scenes fell into
that category, for example - so in terms of the overall storyline, the
movie was quite uneven; even dull at times - especially at the start.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are quite spectacular. The movie deserves credit
for that, and there&#x27;s a fun song routine at the end as the credits
begin to roll. But the uneven story hurts this, in my opinion. It&#x27;s not
bad. Not at all. But it&#x27;s also not really good. Not at all. The cast
probably could have been stronger; the story a little tighter. (4/10)
