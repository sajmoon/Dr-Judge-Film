Everyone is being to harsh on this movie. We loved it! It was
appropriate for my 4 year old and it is disturbing to me that people
want it to be some dark movie. It is a children&#x27;s story so to me it
should be kept that way! I think all the actors especially the two
leads did a fantastic job, sometimes simple and less effects is much
better! Julia Roberts was so funny she was fantastic. Loved seeing her
play this role. Also loved the young snow white she was very good and
beautiful! Loved the prince he was exactly how I pictured the prince!
TMy only complaint is that they changed the Dwarfs names :( but other
then that is was great. Also liked how she got her Father back :) Love
happy endings!We enjoyed it!
