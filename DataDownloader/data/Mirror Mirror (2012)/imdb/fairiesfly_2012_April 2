2012_April 2 
First off: See this with a good set of friends. Half of the charm for
me was turning to my best friends and seeing the look of horror on
their faces when they realized what I had dragged them to. Here are the
reasons I like this:<br /><br />A. Costumes were cute. They were supposed to be wild and outlandish but
I found myself really strangely attracted to the dresses. B. Julia
Roberts who? The dwarfs were where it was at! They completely stole the
show. C. It&#x27;s not supposed to be &#x22;stick to the storyline&#x22; type of deal
because it&#x27;s not serious and doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously. D. Lily
was adorable. With that sort of big name character it&#x27;s really hard to
keep it simple like she did. E. The innuendos that the children don&#x27;t
understand will crack you up and no worries parents... they won&#x27;t pick
up on them. F. People said it was bad. This might be the hipster in me
but... I was really glad that I didn&#x27;t think it was.
