I appreciated parts of this movie more than anticipated. The set
design, costuming, makeup, and special effects were fairly substantial
in &#x22;Mirror, Mirror&#x22;.<br /><br />I would like to see more of Lily Collins, who portrayed Snow White. She
handled the emotional aspects and physical rigors of this role quite
well. Her physical beauty is eerily similar to a young Elizabeth Taylor
in &#x22;National Velvet&#x22;. The Seven dwarfs were a standout, and I
especially enjoyed the work of Martin Klebba as Butcher. Sean Bean was
dashingly noble as usual, but they forgot to give the poor guy a few
more lines! What a shame.<br /><br />Cue sad drum roll... this movie was miscast for two starring roles. And
so the dreary tale goes. Er, there it went.<br /><br />Portraying the Queen is Julia Roberts, who tried so hard, gosh darn it.
But her ageless, fresh, and perky persona work against her. Roberts is
a very good actor in certain films, but she did not fulfill the complex
embodiment of evil that was required. It seemed purposeful to have her
jump from a slight Brit accent to her casual American speak, but it
rang hollow, like a gimmick. Without spot on casting for Queen, this
film remains trapped inside a snow globe, manufactured by the
Disneyfied Effect, where barely a blizzard blows.<br /><br />Who would have I cast as the Queen? How about Helen Bonham Carter?
Ashley Judd (who at a young age could have even played Snow White)
would have brought an interesting depth to Queenie. <br /><br />Prince Alcott is portrayed by the typically handsome Armie Hammer. Like
Roberts, he seemed to try his hardest, but this just didn&#x27;t work. In
certain scenes, he comes off as a baffled wimp, which strips the role
of it&#x27;s potential charisma. I realize that Hammer&#x27;s delivery was
intended to provide levity, but it came off as one-dimensional. Even if
I were to close my eyes, Hammer&#x27;s voice quality just cannot carry this
part. You need only watch &#x22;Camelot&#x22;, and witness the effect of heavenly
voices and acting chops -- Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris.<br /><br />Who would I cast as the Prince? Two charming actors who can carry drama
and comedy are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Adam Brody. <br /><br />Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest film of them all?<br /><br />I&#x27;ll place my bets on the forthcoming &#x22;Snow White and the Huntsman&#x22;. It
will be a more sobering portrayal of this fantastical tale. To which I
say: bring it on!
