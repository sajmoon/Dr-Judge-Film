When I went to see Mirror, Mirror, my main line of thought wasn&#x27;t on
the movie itself. Instead, I was wondering why two Snow White movies
were being released within months of each other. This version&#x97;Mirror,
Mirror &#x97;took on the life of a Disney princess movie. Its
competitor&#x97;Snow White and the Huntsman&#x97;looks like it will take on the
action/adventure audience. Luckily, this line of thought disappeared as
Mirror, Mirror began with an intriguing animated opening scene that
reminded me of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two.<br /><br />The storyline of Mirror, Mirror is actually quite fascinating. This,
however, is thanks to a couple of writers a few hundred years ago&#x97;The
Brothers Grimm. The actual screenwriters for Mirror, Mirror have no
talent. The movie endures awkward scene changes, dozens of lines that
miss their mark, and a generally unimpressive use of such talented
actors.<br /><br />It is important to note that one of the most surprising aspects of
Mirror, Mirror is its visuals. From the opening scene to the mirror
world to the puppets to Julia Robert&#x27;s room, this movie is beautifully
pieced together by Director Tarsem Singh. The movie is almost enjoyable
with the great storyline and visuals. If only they hadn&#x27;t brought on an
unknown and an action writer to adapt the screenplay.<br /><br />Lily Collins deserves a bit of praise for Mirror, Mirror. This young
actress was picked to play Snow White because she has the voice and
face of a Disney princess. While the movie was being advertised,
however, Lily Collins was barely showed. Considering she is a main
character, I suspected that this was an indication that she was quite
awful. That is not the case. Whoever constructed the trailer must have
thought Mirror, Mirror would be carried on the shoulders of Julia
Roberts. Only the box office will tell.<br /><br />Mirror, Mirror is enjoyable. It is easily the best children&#x27;s movie of
the year&#x97;so far. At times, I did wonder if it would be too scary or
intense for a young audience. If you plan on taking a kid to this
movie, look up a review that dives into age-appropriateness (Look for
the puppet scene). If you are not young, or going with someone young,
this movie is probably not for you. Although it can be enjoyable, it is
still a kid&#x27;s movie at heart. If you are itching to see a Snow White
movie, it&#x27;s probably better to wait until June First. That&#x27;s when the
better version&#x97;Snow White and the Huntsman&#x97;is released.<br /><br />reillyreviews.wordpress.com
