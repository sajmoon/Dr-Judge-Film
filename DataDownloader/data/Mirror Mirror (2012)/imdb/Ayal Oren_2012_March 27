I really like Snowhite. It&#x27;s a classic and has all the ingredients of
fairytale we all love. A beautiful innocent heroin, an evil witch some
weird magic that sees everything and knows everything but doesn&#x27;t
really take part in the events and even a nice prince charming popping
in at the very end to kiss the damsel in distress and sort it all out.
Everybody knows it so well that twisting the story a little seems
almost necessary, let&#x27;s make it slightly different, lets add something
and change some other thing - people would want to see what their old
favorite fairytale looks like in a new makeup. I&#x27;ve seen through the
years a fair share of Snowhites, and liked almost all of them. This one
should have been right there with the best of them. It has good CG it
looks great. It has some great performances of great actors and
actresses. Julia Roberts does wonderful job as a very evil queen,
Nathan Lane is as brilliant as ever. Even Snowhite is beautiful,
innocent and convincing. And all of it is being wasted on a real
mediocre movie. It&#x27;s paced completely wrong, taking too long to
establish a story that we all basically know from the very start, and
than it rushes to the end without really justifying it, or rather
simply because the story had to end within a certain time limit. The
prince&#x27;s character is buffoonish to the point that one can&#x27;t understand
how would anyone fall for him once they get a look pass his external
appearance. And Sean Bean is wasted more than anyone else in the
insignificant role of the king, probably just because he simply got the
kingly look to perfection. I really wanted to like it, but there&#x27;s too
little to like here, just a strong sense of disappointment at all the
waste.
