I saw this movie last night. <br /><br />The bad... <br /><br />1. The writing wasn&#x27;t very good, or else the directing failed. <br /><br />2. The connections (references to previous scenes or dialog) seemed
forced. <br /><br />3. Julia Roberts is only a half-believable Antagonist. (Is this her
first move as an Antagonist? It looked like it.) <br /><br />4. The attempts at humor were there but most attempts fell flat. <br /><br />5. The alteration of the Snow White story went too far. <br /><br />6. The acting by Armie Hammer (Prince Alcott) was poor and I didn&#x27;t
feel he embraced the Prince role but the scenes he was forced to act in
might actually be to blame, not his acting. <br /><br />7. While leaving we saw a poster for Snow White and the Huntsman and my
wife said something like: &#x22;I want to see that one. I hope it is better
than this one&#x22;.<br /><br />The good... <br /><br />1. It was very clean and child friendly. - No vulgarity and few
innuendos. - The violence was little more than playful sword play. -
Only the very end was there a seen that would be intense for a child.<br /><br />2. The costumes were beautiful (at least my wife kept talking about
them). <br /><br />3. The absurdity of the movie was the best part about it. <br /><br />4. It was just barely good enough to entertain me not bore me. <br /><br />5. Lily Collins was the star (no Julia Roberts and I like Julia a lot).
She was beautiful and out acted every other character in the movie. Her
starring role &#x22;might&#x22; be enough to keep this show from flopping. <br /><br />6. Some of the attempts at humor were actually quite funny.<br /><br />I would recommend it for families with kids as it is a light story that
you can follow while distracted.
