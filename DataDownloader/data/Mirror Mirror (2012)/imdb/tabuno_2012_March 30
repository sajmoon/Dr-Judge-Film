It is with some coincidence that Mirror, Mirror is being released with
the on-coming conclusion of the first season of ABC&#x27;s Once Upon A Time
- a Fantasy-Family Drama series. It&#x27;s understandable why some critics
and audience members would react disappointed with this deviation from
a time-honored approach to our once traditional fairy tales, and seeing
our once beloved Julia Roberts, out of character, in a way that dulls
the shiny lovable persona that we&#x27;ve come to expect from a Julia
Roberts - genuine smile on screen. Nevertheless when the entire movie
plays out, director Tarsem Singh along with a difficult screenplay has
created a finely balanced and risky version of Snow White that is
powerful, nicely off-balanced, dramatically poignant in places that the
traditional animated version could not go, as well as a wry sense of
humor that bubbles up in various places that tickle and entertain like
a court jester. Tarsem has incorporated some of visual design
imagination that he capture in his direction of The Cell (2000), and
brought a otherworldly ethereal ambiance to the mother that helps along
with the script and especially the directing to even out and soften
Nathan Lane&#x27;s idiosyncratic persona on screen.<br /><br />There is the added enhancement of anti-discrimination message and even
the strong hint of the contemporary Indian Slumdog Millionaire (2008)
ethnic dancing flavor in the nice surprise with the ending credits.
What really makes this movie work is Tarsem&#x27;s ability to never abuse
and break the fantasy, fairy tale story and expose the audience to any
real horror elements or the raw, serious realism of a strictly drama
genre. Reminiscent of Finding Neverland (2004), Wrinkle In Time (2002)
and Hogfather (2006), The Chronicles of Naria (2005) this movie has a
serous edge, yet it also has the lightness and fairy tale flavor of
Instead, Tarem and the script has retained the more recent productions
of: A Knight&#x27;s Tale (2001) and blended the contemporary with the
ancient in a more abstruse way that doesn&#x27;t detract but enhances the
performance and delivery of the plot and setting.<br /><br />Enchanted (2007) and Ella Enchanted (2004) that keep their story lines
light and humorous in the strictly romantic comedy genre while Mirror,
Mirror dares to probe the more darker and dramatic presentation to
heighten its authenticity.<br /><br />Mirror, Mirror deserves credit for bringing a new richness of an old
fairytale in a bold and diverted way.
