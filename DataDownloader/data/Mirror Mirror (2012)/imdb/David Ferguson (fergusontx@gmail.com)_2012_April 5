Greetings again from the darkness. Fairy Tales. The Brothers Grimm.
Expectations for a delightful story and fascinating characters should
not be doused. Blah is the best word I have for this version of the
classic children&#x27;s story. The &#x22;updated&#x22; story is a mess, the characters
are quite bland, and the few sets are limited in scope. On the bright
side, the costumes are colorful and, for a change, disliking Julia
Roberts will not place me in the minority ... she is after all, the
evil Queen.<br /><br />I spent most of the movie distracted by Julia Roberts&#x27; lips and Lily
Collins eyebrows. Both are characters unto themselves. Julia Roberts
should be the perfect Queen, but she seemed to put forth little effort
with her lines ... an odd mix of sarcasm for a kids&#x27; movie. Lily
Collins (daughter of Phil) is just bland. She has no screen presence at
all and is swallowed up in her scenes with Roberts, Armie Hammer (the
Prince) and the band of dwarfs.<br /><br />There are so many things I could comment on, but most would be
negative, so I&#x27;ll just leave it alone. Being a fan of director Tarsem
Singh (The Fall), there were moments where is remarkable eye for
colorful visuals provided hope, but the lack of quality story-telling
was just too much to overcome. Stick to the 1937 Disney version, or
hold out hope for the much darker version coming out later this year,
Snow White and the Huntsman (with Kristen Stewart).
