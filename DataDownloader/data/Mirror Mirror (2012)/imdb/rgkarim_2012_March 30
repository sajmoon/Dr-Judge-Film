How many times can Snow White be remade? The answer to that question
for directors seems to be an infinite number of times. Today the latest
remake Mirror Mirror released and so far has received negative reviews.
After seeing the countless trailers for this film, I had my doubts as
to whether this movie would be entertaining or just another mediocre
kids movie to collect dust on the shelves. What was my verdict? Read on
to find out.<br /><br />Mirror, Mirror, like all the Snow White remakes, starts out with a
back-story about the white skinned maiden and the evil queen who is
jealous of her looks. The lovely Snow White (Lily Collins) is a
prisoner in her own castle forced to obey arrogant queen&#x27;s (Julia
Roberts) rules. However as fate would have it, the prince (Armie Hammer
) of a very rich kingdom shows up at the palace after having a run in
with the dwarfs and soon the queen&#x27;s plans begin to unfold. One of the
major twists to this story is that the dwarfs are no longer miners, but
thieves and attempt to bring Snow White into their career. I don&#x27;t want
to say too much more though, as I fear I will ruin too much. <br /><br />What do I have to say about this movie? Well perhaps the biggest thing
I want to say is how much I laughed in this movie. I know a surprise
right, but Mirror Mirror had a variety of comedy that was funny for
both children and adults. The dwarfs in particular had such a wide
range of personalities, which led to some very amusing dialog and
actions that did not grow stale for me. I was impressed with how well
the production team developed their characters, and how well balanced
the characters were, with not one dwarf hogging all the attention. The
other characters themselves also had some clever one-liners, with
Brighton (Nathan Lane) perhaps being my second favorite character of
the bunch. Lane&#x27;s natural sarcasm and ability to be spineless allowed
for some well timed lines that had the audience and me laughing hard,
and his character seemed to be a bridge to the other characters.
Roberts&#x27; portrayal of the queen was fine, but this role made the queen
more a royal snob, than an evil sorceress with a vengeance to destroy
her rival. Collins on the other hand nailed the fair maiden role and
her quaint, politeness seemed to come naturally to her, plus she was
very cute to look at. However, she does have some work to do on the
crying/sad role, as her acting for these kinds of scenes felt overacted
and simplistic. <br /><br />What else does this movie have that made it fun? The pace for one thing
is pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the back-story to be told, and
the humor pretty much starts ten minutes in the movie and doesn&#x27;t stop
until the end of the movie. To my surprise there was some action in the
film, juvenile action mind you but still action, that was both humorous
and well choreographed. Some of these scenes even allowed for some
character dialog that helped with the character development without
being too slow. Another factor is probably how cute this movie is.
Whether it is the positive humor, the beautiful maiden, or even the
playful nature of the dwarfs, this movie is one that is supposed to
make you feel good. I would also say there is a good balance in this
movie, not just in pace, but in comedy and story as well. It&#x27;s
definitely not the best I&#x27;ve seen, but Mirror Mirror kept the story
going without going overboard in humor. <br /><br />There were some things in this movie that still needed some work
though. One thing would be that this story is still another Snow White
remake and although there were some twists to classic tale, it still
was the same tried and true story. Those who go in here expecting it to
not be predictable should turn around now, because you can pretty much
see every major thing coming in this film. Another thing is although
there is humor for both adults and children; there is still a shift
towards the younger audience in this film. Many of the situational
comedy scenes were of exaggerated punches, smacks on the butt, or even
some over exaggerated running into trees. Finally the romance that
takes place in this movie is also more preteen fantasy like as well,
which of course means a bit cheesy and over magical, though that wasn&#x27;t
too big of a problem for me. <br /><br />Overall Miror, Mirror wasn&#x27;t that bad of a movie and is definitely a
good family film for those with younger children. The comedy of the
dwarfs and Brighton were definitely the highlights of the movie, and
the acting for the most part wasn&#x27;t bad. However, the fact that this is
a remake and more for the younger audience really makes it hard to
recommend as a must see in the theaters, unless you want a cute date
movie to go laugh at. My scores for this movie are as follows:<br /><br />Adventure/Comedy: 8.0-8.5 Movie overall: 7.0<br /><br />So until next week my friends this is Robbie K. signing off and
reminding you to enjoy the movies.
