We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones,
hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In
Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached,
by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget
about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions
going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20
minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline
to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all
other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got
out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.<br /><br />This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie
proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in
charge of them are so smart that they couldn&#39;t give any Oscar to The
Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much
higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it&#39;s simply over qualified!
