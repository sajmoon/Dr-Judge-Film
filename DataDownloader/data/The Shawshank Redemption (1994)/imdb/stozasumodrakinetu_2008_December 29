Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King
wrote the book, but it can&#39;t match the film. When I sow this movie I
thought &quot;thats it, this is it, best movie ever&quot;. Sure you can find
people who didn&#39;t like it, and when I ask &quot;why&quot;, and try to guess what
then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why
they don&#39;t like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10
star, I can&#39;t find comment with good reasons that could make me
realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then
this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people
are giving 1 star is that they don&#39;t like ratio &quot;9,2&quot;, they want to do
more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry
for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is
big cow with no knowledge...
