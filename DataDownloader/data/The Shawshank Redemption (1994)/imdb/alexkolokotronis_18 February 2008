This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and
deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built
on from their and that foundation is hope.<br /><br />Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.
Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was
inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just
made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted
of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but
yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot;
Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest
performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep
regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain
away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with
Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy
also becomes friends with the rest of Red&#39;s group. James Whitmore also
gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole
but in the words of Red he has been &quot;institutionalized&quot;. <br /><br />The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this
movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great
cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but
not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares
mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. <br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#39;t listen to the people who say this movie is
overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies
ever. It has everything you could possibly want.
