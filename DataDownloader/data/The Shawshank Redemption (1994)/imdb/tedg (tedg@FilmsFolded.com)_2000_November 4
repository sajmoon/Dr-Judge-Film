2000_November 4 

I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this
writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever
made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!<br /><br />Why? This was my question.<br /><br />The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine
and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case,
they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional
than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much
harder).<br /><br />The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and
staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as
plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the
appeal of this film.<br /><br />The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are
the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No
element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the
score.<br /><br />Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register
this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without
pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and
this has the appearance of what they need at just the right
time.<br /><br />Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not,
and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more
intelligent efforts.
