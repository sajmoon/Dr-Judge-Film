I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about
to tell you why.<br /><br />Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of
murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947
and
receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely
friendship with &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get
things.
Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens
because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt
officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....<br /><br />I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of
respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have
never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g.
Seven).
The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it
wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The
cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the
sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.<br /><br />But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all
other
films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story
and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant,
thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment
on this film, I think he might say: &quot;Get busy watching, or get busy dying.&quot;
Take his advice.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended.
