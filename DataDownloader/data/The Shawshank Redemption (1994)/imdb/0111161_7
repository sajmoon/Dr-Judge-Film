The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally 
found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There 
is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element 
comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. 

I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that 
people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of 
Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. 

However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find 
meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a
different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.

Who is your Andy Dufresne?
