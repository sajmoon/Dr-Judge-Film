I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.
Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what
is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even
though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite
different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are
going through.<br /><br />It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont
didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love
this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie
didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not
see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your
friends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br /><br />Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will
finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand
why this is my all time favorite movie.
