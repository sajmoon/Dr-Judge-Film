Great expectation. And dusty taste. Blue Lagoon was charming and
exotic. The Return was only cold soup. Nothing more. Same recipes, same
ingredients, beautiful actors, tropical place. And few drops of fight
to remove the taste of verdigris. It was not a disappointment but a
donkey loaded with too high expectations. In fact, a summer movie, best
for a season, like many songs. End of a story who gives impressive
hopes and which is little than a hen with golden eggs. Because
everything to be said was said. Fundamental error - the dreams of
producer and naivety of director. It is natural - a squeezed lemon can
not be fresh in any fridge.
