Personally, I love The Blue Lagoon Returns. It is such a beautiful
film. I think that this movie shows people that nature and civilization
are too completely different ways to live. You can also relate it to,
living in the City or The Country. Too different ways to live. Milla
does an outstanding performance, as does Brian. They both make the film
fresh, in some ways. It is a great movie, and I totally recommend it.
It is really natural, and I think that is refreshing. A lot of movies
nowadays are about things that you would expect. But you wouldn&#39;t have
expected a movie like this. Also, the Figi background and land, as you
may call it, adds something. I think that the film makers did a
splendid job, and I thank them for releasing such a good movie. One of
my all time favorite&#39;s, would definitely be The Blue Lagoon Returns.
