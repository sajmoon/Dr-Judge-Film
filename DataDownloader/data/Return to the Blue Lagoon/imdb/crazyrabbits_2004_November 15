Oh boy. Where do I start...this movie...words are failing me...it's
just so incomprehensibly bad. Whose idea was it to make this piece of
trash, anyway? The plot sucks, the characters REALLY suck, and it looks
like the film crew just ripped off half the scenes from the first film.
There are plot holes galore: how do you get pneumonia from standing
outside for 30 seconds in the rain, when you waited out a storm while
standing outside not 10 minutes before? Where did the cannibal people
come from all of a sudden? Why is that old guy who's the skipper on
that ship look exactly like that old guy who took care of the children
in the first movie? If you have the chance to be rescued, why do you
stay in isolation on a tropical island? How did the parents die if the
sailor at the end of the first movie said they were alive? The main
&quot;actors&quot; in this movie have horrible acting skills. There's no plot
whatsoever. It just boggles the mind! I need a stiff drink.
