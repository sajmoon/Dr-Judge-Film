I thought this film had a great theme -- lovers, children standing up and
facing adversity... but the plot and dialog stressed a bit too much on sex,
and marred the nice mood with a raunchy feeling.  I love how the two main
characters were portrayed, but again the plot and dialog were miscentered
on
the topic of sex and the pacing was a bit slow and lackluster.
