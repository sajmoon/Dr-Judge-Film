This film wasted too much time trying to get our heroes back to the island
and the first half of the flick was almost an exact repeat of the same
sequence in the first.  I really wanted to see the grow up again and not
just see how they got lost--which was pretty standard in both films.  Of
course the two castaways had to &quot;rediscover&quot; their sexuality--this is what
this film is about.  The movie really changes into high gear when the
children are re-introduced to civilization.<br /><br />It really explored the question--who is more civilized?<br /><br />Obvious comparisons:
Brooke Shields/Milla Jovovich--looks: dead heat, although Milla
showed
 more skin (she may have had more upstairs to show).  acting:  Brooke seemed
to capture the innocence of unexpected woman hood (she was brought up by a
male, not a female so she may have had less schooling)<br /><br />Christopher Atkins/Brian Krouse--looks: Chris hands down, Brian looked like
a Pillsbury Dough Boy by comparison; acting: Brian had a slight edge, in
that he had to act more &quot;grown up&quot;.<br /><br />Amazingly both original and sequel are worth a watch:  The first for
the
story and acting; the second for Milla and a more interesting
ending.
