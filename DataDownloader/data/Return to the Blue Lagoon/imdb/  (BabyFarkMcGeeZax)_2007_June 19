The Good: - Scenery - Soundtrack - Cinematography<br /><br />The Bad: - Disregards the plot from The Blue Lagoon - Sexual
&quot;overtones&quot; rather than &quot;undertones&quot; - More an attempt at capitalizing
on the popularity of the original than an extension of the latter&#39;s
story<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />There aren&#39;t many situations that manage to capture the imagination as
does watching two children blossom into young adults isolated from
civilization on a dessert island. The Blue Lagoon&#39;s charm was the
unadulterated depiction of the purity and innocence of mind that
&quot;civilized&quot; society deprives us. It was the forgotten image of what
children are all doomed to lose as they experience life based on
societal dictates rather than the nature we are all born with.<br /><br />Return to the Blue Lagoon re-examines these themes, if under the
somewhat greater taint of society&#39;s teachings. In this way, the purity
of the characters of Return is not as pure, the innocence not as
innocent. Although the opening sequence makes quick work of any
attachment to the original, Return was a decent film in its own right.
Fans of the original will inevitably find it difficult to resist the
sequel. The trick will be mentally disregarding it, should it prove
more unsettling than fulfilling.
