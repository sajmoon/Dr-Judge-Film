This film was absolutely beautiful. I can't understand so many people
having a problem with it. Everybody says its horrible, why, what is so
horrible about it? It made me wanna become more natural and relaxed,
knowing that nature is truth and purity while civilization is
corruption and a lie. This movie is definitely for Milla Jovovich and
Brian Krause fans. Milla's acting seems very inexperienced and like she
doesn't care about it, but that actually makes her seem more natural,
although I wish she would be more professional. Brian Krause does an
average job, but again when you watch the movie the last thing you
think about is how the actors act. What gets you the most about this
movie is its beautiful message about how a human being should be,
beautiful and pure in all ways.I definitely recommend this film.
