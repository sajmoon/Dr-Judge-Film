Having read the book by Mark Obmascik and being a birder, I looked
forward to 20th Century Fox&#x27;s film when it was announced over a year
ago. I began to get concerned when I saw the trailer which didn&#x27;t look
like book, didn&#x27;t feature birds and wasn&#x27;t all that funny. Those
unfamiliar with the book or the movie&#x27;s plot line, a &#x22;big year&#x22; refers
to an informal competition in which birders try to see the most bird
species they can within North America (North of Mexico) in one year.<br /><br />My concerns were put to rest within the first 5 minutes. I found &#x22;The
Big Year&#x22; humorous and thoughtful. The writing avoided the caricatures
often associated with birding. I was in shock to see only one bird poop
reference and surprisingly no toilet humor (which I would have expected
based on the cast). Direction by David Frankel (Marley and Me, Devil
wears Prada) was well-paced. <br /><br />The story centers upon 3 men each going through their own version of a
mid-life crisis and hitting the road in search of finding themselves
and birds. Owen Wilson plays the record holder for the &#x22;Big Year&#x22; who
is in constant fear that someone is going to top his record. He must
decide between his obsession and his wife. Steve Martin plays a
successful but retiring businessman who decides to start doing all the
things he put on hold over the years. Jack Black, the poorest and
youngest of the three, sets out to make a mark and in turn, finds
himself. All three actors showed they do have considerable range beyond
their usual comedy shtick. <br /><br />While this story could have generically fit any obsession, the beauty,
magic and mystery of birds clearly rings through. Highly Recommended.
