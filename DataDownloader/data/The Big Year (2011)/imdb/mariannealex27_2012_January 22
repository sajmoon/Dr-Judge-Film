I wasn&#x27;t expecting a good movie at all. It&#x27;s a weird casting but the
characters surprisingly worked very well together. The movie itself was
fantastic. Great cast, usually i don&#x27;t like Jack Black but it was a
part well done, and Martin short was also perfect. Owen Wilson was
picked well for his part because he always seems to be this cocky know
it all, and that&#x27;s what he was. It was full of laughter, sadness, love,
friendship, I even clapped at one point during the movie. All in all i
loved it. I especially liked how it wasn&#x27;t just focused on one thing.
Sure its a movie about bird watchers a competition really, but the
characters learned and found out about themselves in the movie. Who
they really are and the prices they pay for different routes in life. I
gave the movie a ten because it was something that i thought that would
not be worth watching but it really was an awesome movie.
