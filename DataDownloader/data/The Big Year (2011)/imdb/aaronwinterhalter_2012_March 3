While this movie is not what you may expect from these comedic
heavy-weights. It is still a wonderful movie. The humor is very subtle
and the general story is a wonderful change from the norm. It&#x27;s an
incredibly original light-hearted film about 3 men that are all at very
different places in their lives and all share 1 common interest. Over
the course of 1 year the 3 main characters compete with each other,
learn from each other, and form friendships with each other. The film
does a great job of showing the adventure of these characters while
developing a solid secondary story on the effects each of their choices
makes on their families, and ultimately what there lives become at the
end of the film.<br /><br />It amazes me that the general American Movie going public seems to only
respond to movies that are either Covered in CGI, have lots of
explosions, or tons of nudity and require no thought to follow.
