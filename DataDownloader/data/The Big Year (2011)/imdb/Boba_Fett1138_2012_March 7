Well, surprise, surprise. This movie was much better than I could had
ever anticipated. It&#x27;s definitely a better movie than its cast and
premise might suggest to you.<br /><br />Not all comedies are made to make you laugh out loud. Sometimes a
comedy can also be simply sweet and heartfelt and make you feel joyful
inside. And this is a comedy that goes more for a that sort of
approach. And really, while this was not a movie that made me laugh out
loud, this was still one that was a true joy to watch, from basically
start till finish because of that.<br /><br />Seriously, don&#x27;t let the premise of the movie scare you off. For me
this was not a movie about birding at all. It&#x27;s simply a movie about
living your dream and about doing what you want, no matter what your
age or background is. And it&#x27;s not only a movie that shows you the good
sides of this but also definitely the downsides. I thought this was a
quite admirable thing for the movie to do.<br /><br />Because of all of its themes and the interactions between the many
different characters, this movie manages to become a real warm and
heartfelt one. In that regard this movie is perhaps more effective as a
drama than as a comedy really. But having said that, I&#x27;m still glad
they went for a comedic approach of film-making, since it suits its
premise and also obviously all of the actors who are in it.<br /><br />Owen Wilson, Jack Black and Steve Martin are all 3 comedic actors, who
are all surprising good in their roles. Really, if you are not all that
fond of any of those 3 guys, chances still are you are going to like
them in this movie, since they are all holding back and are playing a
more sort of human characters. <br /><br />Really a movie worth having a go at! It might surprise you with how
good and likable it actually is.<br /><br />7/10 <br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
