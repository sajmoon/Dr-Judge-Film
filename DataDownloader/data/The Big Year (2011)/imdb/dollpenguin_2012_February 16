The Big Year&#x27;s low IMDb rating and box-office take had me worried that
this film would be a &#x22;lame-duck.&#x22; Turns out, this movie is really good.<br /><br />I am not a &#x22;birder&#x22; and know very little about birds other than what I
find on a typical restaurant menu. The beginning of The Big Year made
me think I would learn a little bit more about birds, but was
pleasantly surprised to learn that the film is not about birds at all;
it is about people, how we relate to one another, and the things that
drive us to do the things we do. <br /><br />The characters were more three-dimensional than those of any other
movie I have seen in a long time. I think a lot of people are thrown
off because we often don&#x27;t know who to &#x22;root for&#x22; in this film. The
characters seem like real people, albeit participating in a sport most
of us do not understand and have never even thought about trying. I
hesitate to even call birding a sport because there are no spectators,
trophies or prizes involved.<br /><br />Jack Black gives his finest performance ever imo, playing an average
working-class guy named Brad who has a crazy obsession with birds. His
dream of spending an entire &#x22;Big Year&#x22; spotting and photographing as
many birds as possible seems odd to us (and Brad&#x27;s family), but we soon
learn that he is not alone with this obsession. All throughout the
film, Brad offers glimpses of how birds and humans are more alike than
different. Jack Black nails the dialog which manages to be insightful
while avoiding any semblance of pretentiousness. <br /><br />Owen Wilson plays a married contractor named Kenny who takes more pride
in his world record &#x22;Big Year&#x22; than anything else in the world
including his trying-to-conceive wife. He gives a believable, nuanced
performance as someone who will go to any length to protect his record,
yet he is far from an average scumbag villain. He reminds me more of a
prescription drug addict that I might feel sorry for. Kenny is so
blinded by his addiction to &#x22;birding&#x22; that he cannot see the proverbial
forest for the trees.<br /><br />Steve Martin gives a beautifully balanced performance as an aging
business owner who has always dreamed of trying for the Big Year
birding record. Martin is known mostly as an on screen &#x22;wild and crazy
guy&#x22; but in The Big Year, he remains subdued as he has in previous
films such as Grand Canyon and Parenthood. If you liked him in those
movies, you will like him in The Big Year as well.<br /><br />The Big Year was not meant to be a gut-busting comedy, but there are
several humorous moments. This movie also manages to be quite touching,
thought-provoking, sometimes uplifting, occasionally heart-rending, and
beautiful throughout. A lot like life except with better direction,
better actors, great dialog, and fantastic cinematography.
