I am not sure why I didn&#x27;t give this a 1, I guess it is respect for
some of the work done by Owen Wilson and Steve Martin so a 2 it will
be. Hard to believe you can go 97 minutes without a single funny joke.
I watched this on a plane and wished I could have the time back. The
story centers on three characters that are hard to care about. The only
thing to learn is where birds are and well, I can get that on Nat Geo
channel. Now wait, you can learn what a &#x22;Big Year&#x22; is but beyond that
there is nothing to this story. I guess you do get to realize life&#x27;s
balance is the most important thing. Save your time, avoid this
dribble!
