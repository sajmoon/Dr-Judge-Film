In the Big Year, bird-watching (&#x22;birding&#x22; for those serious about the
activity) takes a beautiful backdrop to the story of three men in
different stages of life that are all struggling with priorities and
what is important in life. Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson
all do a great job as lead actors and come across as real bird lovers.<br /><br />The settings are incredible - taking viewers from Attu Island in the
Aleutians to Brownsville, Texas, and everywhere in between. The race to
find birds results in many humorous moments between the three
competitors as they scour North America in search of rare bird
sightings and compete to be the world&#x27;s best birder.<br /><br />Steve Martin does a wonderful job as a man on the verge of retirement,
who is struggling to let go of his career. His long-time dream to spend
a year birding helps him understand what is important in life. Steve&#x27;s
character develops a father-like relationship with Jack Black&#x27;s aimless
computer programmer whose passion is birds. Steve&#x27;s character provides
fatherly guidance and support that helps Jack Black&#x27;s character move
forward with his life and relationships.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is great as the obsessed world&#x27;s greatest birder, who does
everything that he can to stop his challengers - Steve Martin &#x26; Jack
Black. The obsession and drive of Owen&#x27;s character draws anger,
jealousy, and respect from his competitors and other birders. Several
supporting actors providing some funny moments with their hatred of
Owen.<br /><br />Overall, Big Year is a funny and heart-warming movie that will make you
think about your own priorities and dreams...and maybe grab some
binoculars and search out some birds.
