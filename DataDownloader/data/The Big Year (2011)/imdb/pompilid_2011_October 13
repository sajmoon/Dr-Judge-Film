This movie does a pretty good job of enlightening the uninitiated about
why people enjoy bird watching: An appreciation for the amazing life of
birds, fresh air, exercise, meeting new people and an excuse to travel
to many of the most beautiful places around the country and the Earth.
Can you imagine some pretty harrowing adventures thrown in? For some
birders the passion grows deeper and becomes an obsession. At this
point the story is applicable to anyone with a competitive spirit to
win. Eventually sacrifices must be made and ties to family, friends and
work become strained.<br /><br />The winning count for North America was 755 kinds! With the credits at
the end of the film the multitude of colors, shapes and forms of each
one flash by. The beauty and diversity is mind boggling and should
prompt you to get your binoculars and join one of the hundreds of bird
watching chapters for a thrilling day outside away from your desk.
