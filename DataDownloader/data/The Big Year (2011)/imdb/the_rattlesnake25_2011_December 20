In Birding terms a &#x27;Big Year&#x27; is: &#x22;to see who can see or hear the
largest number of species of birds within a single calendar year and
within a specific geographical area.&#x22; So, what do you achieve if you
finish at the top of the list on December 31st? Money? Adulation?
Endorsements? Not really, but more of a self-satisfying inner air-punch
knowing that you, and you alone, are currently the greatest birder in
North America. Director David Frankel, the man behind &#x27;The Devil Wears
Prada&#x27; and &#x27;Marley and Me,&#x27; takes an interesting premise, but
unfortunately he does nothing with it. Instead he creates a &#x27;safe bet,&#x27;
a film which is guaranteed to entertain during the brief moments which
do contain some semblance of excitement and humour, whilst also
refraining from being offensive in any manner whatsoever, but this
results in a film which will fails to suitably engage a mass audience
for its one hour and forty minutes running time.<br /><br />&#x27;The Big Year&#x27; follows a poor, young, yet aspirational birder in Brad
Harris (Jack Black), who also serves as the films narrator, and a
retired former-CEO named Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) who wants to
leave his world of work behind him once and for all (he&#x27;s attempted
retirement before) and actually enjoy the finer points in life for
once. Brad lives with his parents after his previous marriage failed
and despite his financial insecurity and his father&#x27;s reluctance, he
places everything he has into making a Big Year. While Stu, supported
by his wife Edith (JoBeth Williams), just wants to experience birding
for what it is. Despite an insurmountable mountain of wealth at his
fingertips, he instead opts to drive, pillage and work toward his
birding conquest by himself and along the way he meets the determined
Brad as they strike a friendship up over their common love for the
feathery creatures.<br /><br />Alongside their story, there is also Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) who
holds the Big Year record, once a contractor, he decided to turn his
efforts toward his childhood hobby of bird watching, and his hard-work
eventually paid off as he became the most recognised birder in the
world, but this wasn&#x27;t without consequence. Fast forward a few years
later and now Bostick is attempting to settle down with his new wife
Jessica (Rosamund Pike), but when January 1st rolls around again he
can&#x27;t shake the fact that somebody may be attempting to break his
record and he sets out once again to complete yet another Big Year and
in the process he places yet another marriage on the slippery black
rocks of potential divorce-hood as he must carefully navigate a
tight-rope between his hobby and his future.<br /><br />The picture opens with on-screen titles stating that this is a true
story, except for the fact that all the facts have been changed in this
adaptation of Mark Obmascik&#x27;s book, a relatively subtle and
mild-mannered joke which sets the tone for the rest of the movie, the
key word here being: mild. &#x27;The Big Year&#x27; contains an established cast,
a well-developed script, and an experienced director at the helm, but
it consistently fails to grab the audience&#x27;s attention, instead opting
for the precariously easy route of birding puns and slapstick gags
instead. For the birding enthusiasts among us, the constant
quick-witted use of bird names in various puns and humorous jokes is no
doubt going to tickle a few feathers, but to uninitiated it becomes a
painfully slow descent into somebody else&#x27;s hobby and somebody else&#x27;s
dream scenario.<br /><br />While, the characters themselves all seem to develop at a pace, it is
the script, despite being neat, concise and thorough it lacks anything
of vigour. The characters, despite being slightly more than
one-dimensional caricatures, have very predictable and tired journeys,
whilst Bostick also comes across as somewhat of a red herring. For one
moment he comes across as the brash, arrogant antagonist of the piece,
whilst the next he is the honourable birder who wants to do nothing
less than recreate the blissful childhood joy he had when he was a
child growing up around many winged creatures. This could have been
bird-watching&#x27;s quirky equivalent to Christopher Guest&#x27;s &#x27;Best in
Show,&#x27; yet it is more of an example of how filmmaking, no matter how
competent, can still refrain from fully engaging with an audience by
simply refusing to take any chances whatsoever, especially when it is
attempting to bring a mass audience into such an original and
individual recreational activity.
