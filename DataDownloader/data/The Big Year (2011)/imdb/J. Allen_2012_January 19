We saw this movie last night and even though we found it to be somewhat
entertaining but I don&#x27;t think it quite hit the mark. Some of the
locations and scenery were beautiful and interesting and I never knew
that birders went so far out of the way and spent so much money to
follow their hobby. When you assemble a cast headlined by three well
known Hollywood actors you expect to be well entertained. Owen Wilson
performed a decent role as the protagonist jerk which fits him very
well. It was nothing new or adventurous for him and that showed
through. Jack Black showed a new side here as he might actually have
potential to act in something other than that of a total buffoon. Steve
Martin&#x27;s performance was also just run of the mill and we didn&#x27;t see
much effort in the development of his character. Though there are
several big stars associated with this picture it seems as they were
mainly going through the motions and just reading off the script.<br /><br />In summary: Good movie for a Wednesday night at home. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my
money going to the theater to see it.
