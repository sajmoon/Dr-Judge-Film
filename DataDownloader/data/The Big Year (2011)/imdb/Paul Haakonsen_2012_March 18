Initially I had expected this to be somewhat more of a laughing-comedy,
given the three headlining names on the poster; Steve Martin, Jack
Black and Owen Wilson. However, &#x22;The Big Year&#x22; was much better than
just that. Instead of being just another comedy, this movie was more
meaningful and profound.<br /><br />&#x22;The Big Year&#x22; is a warm story about friendship and fulfilling your
dreams and chasing after what you want. Though it may come at a cost,
and just what are you willing to sacrifice to obtain your dreams? There
weren&#x27;t really any major laughs throughout the movie, but still the
story manages to maintain your interest and you want to sit around to
see what happens next. The movie manages to get you submerged into the
race between the competitors in the birding competition, and when they
do manage to catch a glimpse of that rare bird, you feel like you are
right there with them.<br /><br />&#x22;The Big Year&#x22; is actually holds one of Jack Black&#x27;s best performances,
proving that he is more than just your average standard comedian actor.
And the on-screen chemistry between Martin, Wilson and Black is really
working quite well.<br /><br />&#x22;The Big Year&#x22; is a movie full of beautiful shots of nature, scenery,
and of course, birds. I think you will appreciate this movie a tad more
if you are into birding yourself. I am not into that, but I still found
the movie to be rather good, because of the warm and compelling story
that it told.<br /><br />However, I doubt that this is the type of movie that you will watch a
second time around, unless you are into birding, because there actually
is very little leverage in the storyline to support a second watching.
But still, if you haven&#x27;t seen the movie yet, sit down and watch it,
because it is actually a rather beautiful movie.
