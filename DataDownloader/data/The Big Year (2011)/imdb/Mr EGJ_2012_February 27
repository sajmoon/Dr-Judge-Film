With the lead cast consisting of Owen Wilson, Steve Martin and Jack
Black, you would think The Big Year will be just another slapstick
comedy with little to no story and cheap laughs. You would be wrong.<br /><br />The Big Year is beautiful. Three men of different ages cross paths in
their interest for birding; spotting as many birds as one can in one
year.<br /><br />But the film isn&#x27;t really about &#x22;birding&#x22;, it shows us life through
three different views and the challenges life can bring and the choices
that everyone has to make.<br /><br />The Big Year is not a movie you will sit through laughing out loud, but
you will be smiling for the better part of the 100 minutes.<br /><br />One of the most underrated movies of 2011, The Big Year suffered from
lack of promotion and a misleading poster and trailer.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and watch this, you will not regret it!
