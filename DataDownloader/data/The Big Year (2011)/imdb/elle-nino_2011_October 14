Well, they managed to do what might be considered impossible... make an
interesting film about bird watching. Yes, that&#x27;s correct; this movie
is about competitive bird watching. I have to say that I enjoyed it and
the only bird I really care about is the next one that I&#x27;m going to
eat. So, crafting a film with this subject matter depends upon the
characters and the lives they lead more than the subject itself.
Fortunately, the writers deliver three interesting lead characters.
While not superb, they offer a nice cross section of people dealing
with purpose and obsession issues. Plus, the entire cast features
familiar faces everywhere. It&#x27;s a &#x22;who&#x27;s who&#x22; of cameos and surprise
bit parts. Another reason I enjoyed it WAY more than I thought I would.
