With the danger of been considered flat and narrow minded I must say
that this movie was just OK. When you see these actors you expect so
much more. You expect a two hours fun with your family, not a subject
that you never heard of, which is not necessarily bad, but makes you
think &#x22;topics for movies are over&#x22;. Please don&#x27;t put actors like these
in dull movies. I guess this is my word for the movie. Dull. On the
other hand I must agree the sceneries are amazing and there is a scene
with eagles that left me breathless. The movie is colorful and gets you
to so many places. Good travel guide but a non comedy not even a drama.
Why did I watch till the end? I was too sleepy to go away I suppose.
