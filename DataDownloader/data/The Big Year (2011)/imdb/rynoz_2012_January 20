i was hesitant to watch the big year. i saw the critic reviews and saw
that it flopped horribly at the box office. but i could not resist to
watch it because i like jack black and love Owen Wilson. <br /><br />i am more than happy i decided to watch the big year. i gave it a 9 out
of 10. i thought it was well written and the cast did a nice job of
drawing you into the story. i did not feel like i was watch jack black
or Owen Wilson, i was watching brad and bostick. <br /><br />i knew nothing about &#x22;birding&#x22;. if you do then you would definitely
love this movie. if you don&#x27;t , don&#x27;t worry you don&#x27;t have to. i didn&#x27;t
and i still enjoyed it very much. <br /><br />the movie was not too long or too short. there was not too much comedy
or a lack of it either. the movie was the perfect length , had just the
right amount of comedy and a perfect touch of drama. <br /><br />this movie will make you chuckle a few times, make you sympathize with
the characters and choke you up a couple times. <br /><br />i highly recommend you watch it and enjoy it.
