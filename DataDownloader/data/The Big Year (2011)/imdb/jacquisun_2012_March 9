I loved it from start to finish. The acting was great, filmography
fabulous. There is a great story, great friendships, and several dozen
awesome shots of birds and landscapes. I suspect if you are
disconnected from the natural world, you might not get or enjoy this
movie. But, if you love friendship, family, nature and simply watching
a bird out your window == you should enjoy this movie. I can&#x27;t believe
it&#x27;s gotten such low ratings. Jack Black and Steve Martin seem to have
a true friendship and act very well together. I really enjoyed seeing
Jack&#x27;s character grow closer with his Dad while out in the woods trying
to find an allusive snowy owl. Loved it loved it loved it.
