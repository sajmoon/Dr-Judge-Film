I checked out the rating for this movie before renting it and didn&#x27;t
expect much, the trailer didn&#x27;t help any either. Thought it would be
typical Owen Wilson/Jack Black comedy, bunch of laughs and silly
moments here and there. I was so surprised, the movie isn&#x27;t just funny,
it&#x27;s touching. Jack Black isn&#x27;t doing his normal fumbling, bumbling
routine (though he does fall down some), he plays a divorced guy in a
semi-boring job, just trying to follow his passion and find his place
in the world. His dad and him clash over his current choices in life,
his father doesn&#x27;t get his interest in birds but that doesn&#x27;t stop him
from competing in The Biggest Year, a race to see how many birds you
can spot in North America in one year. The results are printed in
Birding magazine. Owen Wilson is the current front runner and some sort
of birding legend, but he&#x27;s also divorced and enduring a rocky marriage
with his third wife, who wants a baby desperately. Owen plays a
complicated character in this movie, he&#x27;s torn between his wife&#x27;s
desires and his desire to be the best competitor, even if that means
playing a little dirty with his fellow teammates. Steve Martin is the
oldest of the group and by far the most successful but fears he&#x27;s
waited too long to achieve his dream of winning Big Year, but takes the
journey anyway despite his company&#x27;s plea for him to stay on and
continue running things as CEO. All three competitors journey across
the county in hopes of being this years winner, along with several
other bird lovers, such as Jim Parsons and Rashida Jones to name a few.
The movie is filled with a lot of laughs as expected, but also
heartwarming moments that sneak up on you. Among the best in my opinion
are the scenes involving Jack Black and his dad, especially their hike
through the woods to find a rare snow owl. The Biggest Year might not
be for some people but my advice is give it a chance before you judge
it, because it&#x27;s much, much better than some might assume with the
sweet, simple message to follow your heart and live out your dreams,
even if it&#x27;s something sort of non-conventional like bird watching
