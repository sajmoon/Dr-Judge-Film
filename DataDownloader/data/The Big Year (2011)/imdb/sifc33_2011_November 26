First off, the landscape and scenery was awesomesauce, and shot
perfectly for the film.<br /><br />The acting was air-tight, and totally believable on all accounts... the
characters all had depth and came from different walks to pursue a
common hobby/passion.. totally plausible..<br /><br />the comedy wasn&#x27;t this played-out, corny, hella weak &#x22;slapstick&#x22; or a
bunch of penis jokes, which was funny the first 20 times I saw it done.
Actually, it was light-hearted by still relevant to the story sorta
&#x22;cat n mouse&#x22; totally hilar, but on a subtle note.<br /><br />Lastly, it gives a good lesson to the viewer without being preachy (127
hours). It&#x27;s a great flick, for those who appreciate a good film, but
you kinda gotta be an indie film lover, or you may not get it.<br /><br />i give it 4 outta 5 legen...wait for it... dairies..
