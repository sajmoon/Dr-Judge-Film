I don&#x27;t see many movies in theaters. But I do usually like comedies,
and I am an avid birder so I had to see &#x22;The Big Year&#x22;. <br /><br />The movie did not focus on birding as much as on the 3 birders and how
competitive birding, traveling the country after the most species in a
calendar year, affected their lives. It had a few moments and featured
a few locations that hinted at what birding is really like, and tried
to depict the thrills it can bring, and the aggravations. But at the
same time this movie tried to be &#x22;mainstream&#x22; and failed. The plot was
rather predictable and the side-characters were very one- dimensional.
Really only birders and birdwatchers will appreciate this movie. Which
is probably the main reason why it&#x27;s received bad reviews.
