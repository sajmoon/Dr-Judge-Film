My husband and I watched this movie last night, not expecting much.
Over time, we began to relax and through the subtle editing,
cinematography, acting and interesting plot line, we found we really
enjoyed it to the end.<br /><br />Steve Martin does not impress me when he plays antic roles but he
impressed me with the soft limning of the character he plays in this
movie. Jack Black I always like, especially in Holiday which displayed
his ability to take a lead role and make it his own. And after watching
Owen Wilson taken back in time in Woody Allen&#x27;s, Midnight in Paris,I
began to have great expectations of him and was not disappointed with
his role as an obsessive bird watcher. You&#x27;d think that any one of the
three actors would turn this movie into a cartoon, but that did not
happen. Each is obsessed in his own way but in believable, human ways.
I also loved Brian Dennehy and Diane Wiest as Black&#x27;s character&#x27;s
parents, JoBeth Williams as Martin&#x27;s supportive wife and Rosamund Pike
as Wilson&#x27;s long-suffering spouse. Actually all 3 were under-utilized
but still added a great dimension to the main actors&#x27;roles. I also
loved the fact that Black&#x27;s boss was a surprising support to his
employee&#x27;s obsessive quest and Black&#x27;s burgeoning love interest was
cute and quirky.<br /><br />We usually make predictions how a movie will end and part of the
prediction came true and the other part was a lovely surprise. I would
see this movie again for all the above reasons and for how peaceful I
felt watching it. Like a soothing, flowing forest brook.
