2008_February 7 
I picked this movie up on the recommendation of a friend - how I wish I
hadn&#39;t. Rarely have I seen such weak directing, ropey dialogue, and
miserable acting - with the exception of Dafoe, who takes it to the
other extreme, and seems to be on a mission to alienate the audience
with his caustic, charmless and bizarrely camp FBI agent.<br /><br />A lot has been made about how this film was canned by the studios in
the aftermath of the Columbine shootings, over concerns of copycat
killings. This seems to have gone a long way to realizing the movie&#39;s
pretensions to cult classic status, but surely the real reason the
studios canned this picture was because of its sheer awfulness. Even
for a mindless action flick, the premise that there is some kind of
natural justice in a pair of pseudo-Irish thugs taking out &#39;bad&#39; people
on a whim just doesn&#39;t wash. The brothers McManus literally hang their
crosses at the door when they enter their house, which says it all
really - a couple of thrill-killers paying lip service to Catholicism.<br /><br />For anyone deciding whether or not to invest their time in watching
this: if you like childish, witless, over-reaching action films, then
this is the one for you.
