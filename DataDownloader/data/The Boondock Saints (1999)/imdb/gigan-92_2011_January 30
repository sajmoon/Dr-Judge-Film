I could quite possibly go on to write an essay on why this film is so
intensely great. I&#x27;m surprised Troy Duffy hasn&#x27;t sat in the director&#x27;s
chair again, although I am very anxious to purchase the sequel, which
he did direct. Where to start, well obviously this film&#x27;s amazing cast.
One of my favorite actors ever, Willem Dafoe steps up and delivers a
spectacular performance for a very original and genuinely well written
character. Sure you could despise the film with all your heart for the
fact that Dafoe is playing a homosexual, but that&#x27;d make you two
things: (1) a very close-minded conservative and (2) a person who has
no desire for originality and genuine character design in films. Sean
Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have a natural chemistry that made
it seem they were actually brothers. and were just plain bad ass
through out. Billy Connolly is awesome in it as well. He has a majestic
and menacing presence through out as Il Duce. And David Della Rocco was
just great, playing &#x27;himself&#x27; as Duffy would have it. He was just
another well played and interesting character, one to truly remember in
film history.<br /><br />Aside all the great characters, the movie has a very involving
storyline and atmosphere. It&#x27;s a very graphic, violent and intense one,
yet along with it all is some very well placed dark humor. It all just
feels so natural you&#x27;ll be laughing constantly and embracing these
characters. By the end of the film, I guarantee you&#x27;ll be tempted to
quote them. And to top it all off, the premise in itself is a
statement. The message being that perhaps the reason the world is so
corrupt and defiled today is because of the flawed justice system.
Whether you view it as a well-themed masterpiece or a simple-minded
action film is up to you, regardless the mark the film leaves behind is
unmistakable.
