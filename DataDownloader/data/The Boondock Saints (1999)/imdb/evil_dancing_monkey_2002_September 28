and how over-rated it is<br /><br />I was told that the movie was excellent by many, many people. I found it
slightly odd that the rave reviews were, by-and-large, given to me by a
certain group of people, namely, sheep-witted white suburbanite video game
addicts.<br /><br />&quot;This,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;could just be a fluke. Maybe they're just
the
first to spot this rarely watched movie.&quot;<br /><br />I can see why the aforementioned audience liked it. There are a lot of
fire-fights.There are a lot of highly, highly unrealistic, disgustingly
one-sided fire-fights.<br /><br />The plot is hackneyed and underdeveloped. Had the writer gone through one
or
two more drafts, maybe it would have been entertaining. The characters
were
very flat. There really was no development of the characters, with the
exception of Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).<br /><br />There are also gaping plot holes (or things that are entirely left
out).<br /><br />As I said, there is an audience for this, and once members of that
audience
watch the movie, they take it, well, religiously. This movie is compared
to
Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. There are vaguely similar themes, but The
Boondock Saints lacks all of the style, wit, intelligence, and originality
that the other two films have.<br /><br />But if you don't mind seeing a film about vigilante justice (I am still
not
convinced that that is the motivation behind the whole thing; it seems to
me
that the characters' sole purpose is fairly motiveless violence with
socially acceptable targets [read: 'evil people']) with lots and lots of
shooting, go ahead and check it out.<br /><br />Just my $0.02..
