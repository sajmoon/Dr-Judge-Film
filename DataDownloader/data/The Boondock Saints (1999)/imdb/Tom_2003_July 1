The story was very promising  when I sat down to see this
film.
How ever, some how the failure of the director is total in this
movie...<br /><br />I got almost angry when I realized that what could have been a perfectly
good movie, was wasted because of some directors total lack of
feeling when making a movie.<br /><br />The timing was terrible, the way the film was cut and put together was
nothing but sloppy. The camera work was somewhat ok, but the director
really
seemed to trying to get som sort of recognition from the industry or
something in every single scene!! rather then trying to make a good
movie.<br /><br />He simply tried WAY TOO HARD...<br /><br />The FBI-agent was way too psycho, the heroes was way too cool, their
friend
was also way too psycho, the mob guys was soo bad(as in evil and
vicous)that they turned ridiculous. Did you see that russian gangster, in
that sceene where the heroes fell down through the roof? Oh my god, such
a
terrible fake belly he had in that scene. It's one of those small things,
the whole movie is filled with'em.<br /><br />There is no excitement in the movie what so ever.
I could predict almost every scene in the movie and when you can predict
a
film, it tend to get quite boring.<br /><br />The dialogue was also over the top, unmotivated talk, yells, screams, and
unmotivated usage of the f-word in some scenes just made me
yawn...<br /><br />I entirely blame the director for this one, he really turned a potential
&quot;A&quot;
movie into a crappy, booring &quot;H&quot; movie at the best.
This could have been the big break for the guys who played the heroes,
beleave it or not, but i think they did a good job them two. Too bad some
one else ruined their oportunity.<br /><br />Man, what a whaste on good film...<br /><br />
