Having seen the high rating on IMDb and read the comparisons to
Tarantino's work, I questioned how it could have slid under my radar
screen. Now I know. For probably only the third time in my life, I
actually couldn't watch the entire film. It was that lame. Poor acting,
bad writing and aimless script aside, the film's worst sin is how badly
it wants to be cool/funny/stylish and how miserably short it falls of
that goal. The tattooed, hard-drinking, wise-cracking anti-heroes. The
gay FBI agent who gyrates to Italian opera as he combs crime scenes
(nice disc player, by the way). The Ron Jeremy cameo. The only remotely
entertaining bit was when Rocco copped a feel off the passed-out
stripper. Everything else - yawn. Anyone who thinks this even remotely
resembles Pulp Fiction must have had a lobotomy.
