I have no idea how this movie became such a cult classic. I purchased
it without seeing it, because all my friends, co-workers, family, etc.
raved about the movie. What a waste of $$$. If you are looking for a
movie with a similar theme try Frailty. Much better movie. Please tell
me what you see in it. Why do you people find it so compelling. It&#39;s
one of those movies that&#39;s so bad, it pisses me off. It irritates me
that anybody made money from this compost heap. Please tell me why you
love it so much, and if you haven&#39;t seen it STAY AWAY!!!. Save your
five bucks &amp; go rent FRAILTY. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Thank you.
