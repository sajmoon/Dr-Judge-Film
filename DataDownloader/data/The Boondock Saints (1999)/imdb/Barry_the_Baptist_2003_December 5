Troy Duffy's &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; is an execrable mess filled with atrocious
editing, a 
terrible soundtrack and appaling performances. After seeing this film I felt
compelled to 
go straight to confession and receive expiation for my sin in buying into
the 
overwhelming hype surrounding this 'slick, stylish film'. Everytime Mr.
Duffy faded to 
black needlessly, I thought about denouncing my Catholicism. It gets three
stars out of 
ten, one for the father, one for the son and one for the holy
spirit.
                                          - Amen
