I&#39;d say over half of the people I know say this is their absolute
favorite movie. However, every one of those people I know who say it&#39;s
their favorite movie aren&#39;t big movie-watchers. They like movies for
mindless action, or stupid comedy, or cheap scares. I&#39;ve noticed most
reviewers who dislike this film have problems with the morality of this
movie. I think movies are movies, and immorality is a part of life, so
I think it should be shown in movies. However, this movie has a huge
list of other problems that make it virtually unwatchable to the
knowledgeable movie-watcher.<br /><br />Now, there&#39;s nothing wrong with just watching movies for mindless
action and such, because if it entertains you, then it serves its
purpose. But as someone who appreciates the artistic aspects of movies,
I have to review it in that manner. This movie has horrendously
cartoonish acting by basically all of the people with smaller roles. It
is riddled with generic, stereotypical portrayals. Now, if this movie
didn&#39;t take itself so seriously, that would be perfectly fine.
Unfortunately, this is a low-budget movie trying to be an epic
Hollywood masterpiece, and it really shows. In taking itself so
seriously, it falls desperately short of what it&#39;s trying to
accomplish. The plot is just a formality in this movie. You can tell it
only has a plot because it has to. They seem rather disinterested in
the scenes involving character development.<br /><br />I felt sad for Willem Dafoe. He&#39;s a great actor, but here he is in this
role he doesn&#39;t seem to fit at all. He gives the best performance of
anyone in the movie, but even he fails to be believable. I wasn&#39;t sure
what he was doing in this mess the entire time I was watching it. The
two lead actors, Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, serve their
purpose well enough. You can tell their goal was to just not mess up,
they weren&#39;t really interested in delivering powerful performances.
They manage to not be laughably bad, but are far from good. However, by
the end of the film, how can you care about the characters? The movie
expects you to be on the side of these terribly boring, uncharismatic
characters. You can&#39;t have an emotional finish without any form of
emotional scenes in the earlier stages.<br /><br />Finally, notice how this movie is the director&#39;s only one. He&#39;s no ace
director, and the comparisons to Tarantino are disgusting. Even if you
like this movie, how can you think it&#39;s made in any way like a
Tarantino film? The backbone of Tarantino&#39;s films and what makes them
so great is the consistent brilliant dialogue. Not only does The
Boondock Saints not have any brilliant dialogue, it isn&#39;t even trying
to be big on dialogue to begin with. To compare Duffy to Tarantino
isn&#39;t even fair, considering Tarantino has consistently made incredibly
brilliant films, and Duffy has just made one cult hit that in my
opinion is extraordinarily poor. This movie is certainly for those who
just watch movies for entertainment. If you are looking for depth, stay
far away.
