The general concept of this movie was good. Two Irish Catholic brothers
decide to bring their own brand of justice to the world via masks and
silenced pistols. As they kill off the scum of Boston, they are
investigated by an FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe.<br /><br />This movie has 2 major pitfalls. One of which, is the character&#39;s
over-acting, especially Willem Dafoe&#39;s. You really don&#39;t have to be a
movie buff to pick out the bad acting in this movie. Dafoe&#39;s part is so
overplayed, it takes away from the gritty realism this movie might have
otherwise.<br /><br />The other problem with this movie is its rather predictable story.
There are really no surprises in this one. It would&#39;ve been nice to see
the writer take the movie into a darker path exploring the moral
conflicts between the religiosity of the brothers and their actions.
Instead, they are pretty much hardened killers immediately after their
first kills. This brings a lack of depth to the main characters,
leaving you detached from them.<br /><br />I also had problems with the gratuitous use of slow motion in this
movie. Sure, slow motion filming has its uses, however it almost always
detracts from grittiness and realism. Action scenes in good gritty
movies are almost always filmed in regular speed and with ambient
noise.<br /><br />All in all, The Boondock Saints is an interesting idea written and
filmed with disappointing and predictable Hollywood cookie cutter
styles.
