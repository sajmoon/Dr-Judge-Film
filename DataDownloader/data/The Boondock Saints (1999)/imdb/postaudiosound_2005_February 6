I can almost guarantee you that any movie featuring Ron Jeremy is going
to be sub-par on a number of levels. This is no exception - this movie
nails about every clich&eacute; that hack writers have been working hard to
create in the last decade. After being around film students for the
last decade, I can assure you that this movie has been written hundreds
of times by kids who have seen Pulp Fiction a dozen times too many. How
this specific version was made beats me, but I can only assume that the
director had a trust fund or slept with a Coppola. (Well, maybe more
like an Arquette) <br /><br />You'll see dream sequences with slow motion rain, a detective who
listens to opera while solving crimes, an insane madman in a Hannibal
Lecter cage, a multitude of racial stereotypes... all infused with
religion and extreme violence. Worst of all, the film (almost
offensively) attempts to answer serious social questions in the end -
in the lamest way possible, of course. I won't spoil it, but I'll say
that any movie that ends with interviewing people on the street has
failed to make its point.
