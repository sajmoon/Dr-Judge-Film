Among the pathways of depravity there lays a mile marker for The
Boondock Saints. A film so inertly void of humanity and purpose it
rarely saw a theater screen. Although perhaps it should have, the
growing number of fans has made this film an alarmingly enormous cult
sensation.<br /><br />The plot is a simple vigilante story of two brothers who murder those
they see as reprehensible. The fact that they are reprehensible as well
is never understood. Masked behind the idea that they are good Irish
Catholics, the duo set forth in a violent fury ridding the world of
those they deem evil. The detective assigned to apprehend the two is
played by Wilem Dafoe in a performance so over the top we forget how
good of an actor he really is. And yes, the cop is just as screwed up
as the crooks - this is one of those stories. Though he is sent to
arrest the wanted men, Dafoe&#39;s character is much more interested in
making dramatic gestures and compiling evidence while listening to
classical music, in a scene of eye-rolling silliness.<br /><br />Along the way the criminal pair pick up a psychotic counterpart who
yells a lot and seems so much like the loose cannon they do not need.
We learn very little about why the two have set forth on this rampage
or where this idiotic third wheel came from, or maybe we do. By this
time I had lost any need to pay attention.<br /><br />Following in the ancestry of Tarantino films, The Boondock Saints has
the appearance of imitating (badly) a genre on the edge of what is
permissible. Because Tarantino&#39;s characters utter &quot;nigger&quot; does not
give clearance for the word to be used in any random situation. This
film as a result comes off as racist, xenophobic, homophobic and
certainly doesn&#39;t put religion in the best light. If there is anything
positive about the film, it does excite the thirteen-year-old thrill to
see novel executions involving commodes and kitty cats. But like that
feeling the film is at best immaturely titillating and at worst
dangerous. .5* out of ****
