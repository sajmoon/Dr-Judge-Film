I want the time I wasted watching this film back! Possibley the worst
film I&#39;ve ever seen.<br /><br />This movie sucked. It was horrible. Horrible is an understatement.
Story sucked, acting sucked. Why? Why? Why? Don&#39;t waste your time.<br /><br />Whoever gave this film more than one star is a complete moron. They
should be banned from rating any more films. In fact, people like that
really scare the hell out of me. Think if they were your wife or
girlfriend. Sitting next to each other in a theather or on a sofa.
They&#39;re totally into it and going on and on about how great it is/was.
My friends, this kind of red flag is such a blessing. I&#39;ve just
discovered that a movie this lame actually has value.
