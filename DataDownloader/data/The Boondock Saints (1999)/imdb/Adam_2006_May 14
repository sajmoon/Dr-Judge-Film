Maybe there is some wit to the film, The Boondock Saints - but I didn&#39;t
see any....begged my friend to turn it off actually. That was even
before I met Tony Montana and his girlfriend at my sushi restaurant in
NY. Tony was super cool and I have to say very genuine.<br /><br />To watch that doughy, smoky, foulmouthed, hack of a douche-bag Troy
Duffy or as he likes to be called, T. Duff - go off on the few guys
with integrity in his &quot;Syndicate&quot; makes my stomach turn.<br /><br />But the capper - HE IS A RAGING ANTI-SEMITE AND
RACIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the film Overnight, you
can hear him say it himself when he accuses the music engineers of
being &quot;Jewish&quot; about production - whatever that means. I think it&#39;s
because they wanted to have input on his crappy band&#39;s music..and
clearly the musical aficionado that he is - seeing as how they only
sold 690 albums...has more expertise.<br /><br />I highly encourage all to do as I&#39;ve done and let this misogynistic,
alcoholic, anti-semitic, racist piece of scum know that he should save
the world a lot of grief and not make a sequel and just crawl back
under the rock he came from. Write him at Troy@theboondocksaints.com.
