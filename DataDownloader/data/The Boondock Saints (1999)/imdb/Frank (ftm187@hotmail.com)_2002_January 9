People were talking about this film that it was so cool, so I checked it
out. The director obviously wanted it to be a sort of Pulp Fiction, but he
failed, in my opinion. The acting isn't that special, the dialogues
neither.
B.S. is sometimes funny.. sometimes cool shooting.. but overall.. it just
didn't do much to me. I dont understand why this movie has a average
rating
this high..  5/10
