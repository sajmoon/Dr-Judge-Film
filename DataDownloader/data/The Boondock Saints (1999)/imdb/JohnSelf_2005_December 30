I'm not sure what an &quot;igiot&quot; is. Perhaps, some Irish idiom, but I'm
guessing it's more likely an idiot who can't type (see below).<br /><br />I tend to only write about movies I love or I hate and I hated this
one. Actually I feel sort of cheated. I rented this movie based on the
IMDb rating, which more often than not is reliable. I'm not sure what
happened here. I like Willem Dafoe and he doesn't do a bad job; but my
God there are a litany of unbelievable events that make this thing
pretty tedious to watch. It's not the acting that is bad - it's that
the plot is chocked full of gaping holes in logic. And, movies don't
have to be completely logical for me to like them, but at least they
should make sense within the storyline.<br /><br />I am curious who these people are that liked this thing. Movies like
Armageddon and Godzilla have more cogent stories. Are there that many
victims of lobotomies running around? I suggest if your synapses are
firing normally stay away from this piece of offal. But,if you like
this check out &quot;The Cube,&quot; &quot;The Forgotten,&quot; &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; and &quot;The
Last Castle&quot; - four other similarly inane movies. &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; is
stupid beyond belief.
