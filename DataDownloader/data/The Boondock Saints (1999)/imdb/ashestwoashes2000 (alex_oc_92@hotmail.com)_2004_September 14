...albeit a little too proud of itself. I waited a long time before
actually watching this film, then an ex-girlfriend loaned it to me
telling me I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't. Boondock Saints
looks and feels like a fan film, and it is well done. The actors, I
felt, were carefully chosen, did a wonderful job, and composed
themselves well. The only real annoyances were Willem Dafoe's character
being a know-it-all, and David Della Rocco who screams his head off
throughout the whole movie. Its rare that a movie of this genre has a
gratifying ending, and when the credits started rolling, I was a little
sad that there wasn't more. This movie kept me entertained thoroughly,
and I was happy that I finally watched it. For those who haven't seen
it, sit back and enjoy the violent ride, for it's a fun one.
