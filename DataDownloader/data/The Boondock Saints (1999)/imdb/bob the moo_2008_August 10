Irish-American brothers Connor and Murphy get into a bar fight with a
couple of Russian gangsters, which ends in them killing them. The gang
nature of the killing brings FBI expert Paul Smecker into Boston but
before he can even get going, the brothers give themselves up and are
found innocent. The ease of the crime and the general local opinion
that they did a &quot;good thing&quot; only encourages them to carry on and, with
masks and heavy weaponry, set out to take down those that the law
cannot touch &#150; but Smecker and the authorities are only a few steps
behind them and the criminals themselves have weapons to strike back.<br /><br />A few years ago I saw the documentary Overnight which charts the
implosion of the writer/director of this film and shows how fame
reveals just what one is like &#150; in this case, arrogant and obnoxious.
Anyway, aside from what a c0ck Duffy is, the film reminded me that I
hadn&#39;t seen the cult film Boondock Saints for quite a few years and
wondering if it were anything other than the &quot;OK&quot; film that I remember.
Well it took a few years for it to be repeated on television but
eventually I got round to seeing it. The truth is just what I remember
it to be &#150; an OK film but nothing more than that and certainly nothing
to justify what Duffy thinks of himself. The best thing about the film
is the structure, which sees us following Dafoe in regards seeing the
aftermath of the action sequences before we see the action itself &#150;
this I liked and thought it added some interest to the delivery that
the very simple plot didn&#39;t.<br /><br />Other than this though the story is quite straightforward and offers
nothing particularly good in the way of dialogue or content. The
greenlight obviously came thanks to Tarantino&#39;s success because this
story of criminals is clearly indebted to him; however the dialogue is
nothing comparable by any means and instead is either lazy rubbish or
heavy religious material. The action is the second appeal and it is
delivered with the usual style that one would expect from a director
who has learnt his &quot;trade&quot; from watching other films. Slow-motion,
jumping while shooting etc etc, it is all here and it is all good
enough if you are in the mood but certainly nothing special.
Disappointingly (but unsurprisingly) the film doesn&#39;t have anything
challenging or insightful about the vigilantism it depicts. The closing
credits are the closest it ever gets and that is too little, otherwise
it does nothing to challenge the viewer or even to promote a political
view &#150; it just uses it to produce a generic action film.<br /><br />Of the cast, all credit must surely go to Dafoe for the wonderful way
he hams it up. The transvestite bit is a jump too far and is just silly
but otherwise his overblown FBI agent is just the bit of fun that the
film needs. Conversely both Flanery and Reedus are both surprisingly
flat in the title roles, doing simple Irish-American roles but not
bringing much to it. Rocco is OK in his character &#150; at least being
lively, while Rota is a strange find for 24 fans. Connolly is there for
the money and his character is superficial at best and a cameo from
pornstar Ron Jeremy is just a pointless and obvious bit of casting.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is a cult film but it is far from a good one. At
its base it is a simple genre film that offers nothing special to make
itself stand out. Disappointingly it has so-so dialogue and nothing to
challenge or engage the viewer in the content and really, outside of
doing everything that other similar films do, it only has a wonderfully
daft turn from Dafoe to make it stick in the memory.
