As is obvious from the reviews here, this movie is polarizing - you&#x27;ll
either love it or hate it. I certainly recommend giving it a try, and
seeing for yourself what camp you fall into. At worst, you waste an
hour and a half. You can even watch it for free on YouTube, so you
don&#x27;t have to waste your money. My main warning is that the R rating is
certainly earned, by both language and violence. <br /><br />Some of the pluses? <br /><br />The characters. The relationship of the brothers - they are rowdy and
boyish and great partners. While they can be serious, they can be
lighthearted a moment later. And very fun accents to listen to! Willem
Dafoe&#x27;s character - completely over the top, but great to watch. I like
him better here than I do as the Green Goblin. Others find Rocco very
amusing, though I&#x27;m not personally such a fan. Doc, the older bartender
with Teretz, is more amusing to me. <br /><br />The fantasy. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if someone could just take care of all
the scumbags out there? The vigilante theme hits a chord. While I don&#x27;t
know of anyone who would take this seriously (ie, go out and start
shooting people), there&#x27;s enough to it to find appealing in the context
of the movie. <br /><br />The storytelling. I really enjoy the out-of-sequence scenes as a way to
keep the parallel stories of the law enforcement and the brothers
interwoven. Smecker becomes more and more involved over the course of
the film, and this device makes that happen. <br /><br />The soundtrack. Some great music! <br /><br />The drawbacks?<br /><br />Don&#x27;t expect well-sketched villains. These are caricatures of the mob.
I liked Papa Joe most of the time, but still. <br /><br />Language. I&#x27;m sorry, but when you have to use the F-word 250 times,
that&#x27;s overdone. There were times it was amusing or relevant, but not
in every f&#x27;in line. See? Completely unnecessary. It loses its effect
when you don&#x27;t save it for its intensity. <br /><br />Morality. The attempt to justify the film&#x27;s actions are not
terribly...convincing. At least Smecker was supposed to be
drunk/hungover while delivering those lines! The brothers convince
their best friend to switch from &#x27;you&#x27;re crazy!&#x27; to &#x27;you should
recruit!&#x27; in a matter of minutes, suggesting that everyone&#x27;s
convictions are rather shallow. After all, they&#x27;re not exactly saints
themselves...just not mobsters. I think a lot of people are uneasy that
the movie doesn&#x27;t try harder to condemn vigilantism. This is *not* The
Oxbow Incident!<br /><br />I love the movie, at the end of the day. I&#x27;m a 30 year old woman who
doesn&#x27;t curse or have tattoos. Just sayin&#x27;. I can see some flaws, sure,
but it&#x27;s hard not to root for Connor and Murphy MacManus!
