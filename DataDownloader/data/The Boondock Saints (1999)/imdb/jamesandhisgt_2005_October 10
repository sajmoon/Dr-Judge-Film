Now, I went out and bought this movie because I can appreciate such a
flick but over all this movie really isn't all that good. in fact it's
close to being bad. It seems like it was written by a bunch of 12 year
old boys in detention. It's also somewhat demented. At one point, the
end, they torment a man before they kill him and for some reason it
takes 3 people with 3 guns several bullets to the head to kill him.
This is also going on in front of a crowd with women and children.. It
seems to me like they found a way to be mass-murderers and sleep at
night.<br /><br />On a more positive note Willem Defoe did an outstanding job as the
homosexual detective.
