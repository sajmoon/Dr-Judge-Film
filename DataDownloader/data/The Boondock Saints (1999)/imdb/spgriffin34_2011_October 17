2011_October 17 
I was encouraged by several people to see this film, telling me it was
smart, action packed, funny, and well-written. I am not a film student
but I like good movies. I like good acting. I like good story telling.
This has none of this. I read the positive reviews of this film and I
wonder if we watched the same movie. This is one of the most god awful,
pretentious pieces of garbage ever put on film. I read one review that
put Troy Duffy (the film&#x27;s writer) in between Tarantino and Ritchie. If
Guy Ritchie only made &#x22;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&#x22; and
&#x22;Snatch&#x22; and then made a dozen other movies starring Madonna, Troy
Duffy still makes him look like Martin Scorsese. The action sequences
are well produced which is the ONLY reason I gave this a 2 instead of a
one. I borrowed a VHS copy from a friend years ago. I watched the film
three times to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing the good parts he kept
telling me about. There are not enough synonyms for the word &#x22;bad&#x22; in
the English language to describe this film.
