In 1994 Quentin Tarantino made an academy award winning film that would
influence many films, even today. Many filmmakers have tried to
duplicate Tarantino&#39;s style and &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; is another one of
those films. Do you know what that original film was? Your right, it
was &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Regardless of how much &quot;influence&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;
has had on the making of &quot;Boondock Saints,&quot; is &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; a good
or a bad film?<br /><br />Two Irish brothers feel that they have had a mission from God to get
rid of evil human beings. FBI agent Paul Smecker, while trying to
figure out the murders, discovers that what the boys are doing is
right. By fighting for truth and justice, are the Irish brothers
accepted by the public or are they considered cold hard murderers? <br /><br />&quot;Boondock Saints&quot; is a lousy film, and it is not only because it is a
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; wannabe because throughout history we have seen film,
television, and or literature that borrows significantly from something
else. &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; had a lot of potential because of the premise
but the writing is not very good. Even though they infused many bits
from &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; if this reviewer had a lot of fun of viewing the
movie, it would not have mattered.<br /><br />Like &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; puts a lot of emphasis on the
crime/action genre, sprinkled with comedic elements throughout, but the
problem is &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was actually funny. This reviewer laughed
more unintentionally then intentionally. In fact, the funniest
intentional part of the movie was done a lot better in &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;
It got to the point where it felt like an unintentional parody on the
genre.<br /><br />The acting was okay. Billy Connolly is one of the bright spots as Il
Duce. William Dafoe is the main reason to watch this film as a gay FBI
agent, Paul Smecker. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus plays two
Irish twins. Though they are twins, the viewer will feel that they are
just a bit closer then that (if you know what this reviewer means.)
David Della Rocco was just as pointless as his character, Rocco. The
biggest error of film is casting Ron Jeremy as a member of the mafia,
Vincenzo Lipazzi. Lesson in film, if you want to be taken seriously,
never cast Ron Jeremy.<br /><br />In conclusion, you could watch something a lot better then &quot;Boondock
Saints.&quot; If Billy Connolly and William Dafoe were not in there, this
reviewer would probably say that this film could not have gotten any
worse. The whole film felt like it was trying to be too cool. Though
just because you say the F-word and fire many bullets, does not mean
that you are cool. Unlike &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; there is not that character
or phrases that are very memorable and there are no characters to root
for. It was just a mess all together.
