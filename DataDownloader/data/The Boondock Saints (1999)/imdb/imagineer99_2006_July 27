There&#39;s nothing more frustrating than somebody who doesn&#39;t get the
joke. The punchline rolls by and he&#39;s left sitting there&#151;gazing
awkwardly into space struggling to figure it all out. Troy Duffy&#39;s
first feature film, &quot;The Boondock Saints,&quot; rests in that type of
eternal limbo. At first glance, it seems to bounce back and forth from
payoff to payoff, giving the audience a good deal to chuckle about.
But, as the film keeps rolling, we begin to get the feeling that &quot;The
Boondock Saints&quot; is becoming choked-up by its own gag. Half-way
through, the uncomfortable silence of an unrealized ruse seeps into the
room. And, sadly it becomes apparent that the filmmakers don&#39;t quite
get their own joke.<br /><br />&quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; is a simplistically rendered adult-male
fairytale. Whereas children relish in tales of knights and princesses,
Duffy makes his Camelot a kingdom adorned with stylized hit-man and
generic mafiosos. Two Irish Brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman
Reedus) attempt to save the world from the evil and the corrupt by
becoming (what else?) the embodiment of a Tarantino fanboy&#39;s fantasy.
Adorned with dark sunglasses and nifty accents, the MacManus twins
strut around the streets of Boston, muttering pleasing Catholic prayers
in a futile attempt to somehow try to veil their inherent vacancy.
Amidst all the good natured killing is a gay cop, played by Willem
Dafoe with bombastic comedic zest, who is attempting to stop these
vigilantes with hearts of gold. Dafoe&#39;s character&#151;easily the most
charismatic of the bunch&#151;is a walking, talking caricature. He smiles
and slaps around his compatriots, all the while flicking his bouffant
into the air like a swimsuit model leaving the ocean.<br /><br />This is all not to say that &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; is a complete
failure. Sure, it&#39;s over-the-top, but at least there are plenty of gun
shootouts and interesting carnage to keep the ball rolling. The
slightly non-linear story is managed well. As Dafoe handles one crime
scene, we get to see the whole shindig played out in real-time. It&#39;s a
slow-motion gunfighter&#39;s dream! Bodies fall and bullets soar as Dafoe
reenacts the entire massacre with emphatic precision.<br /><br />The true problem with the film is that it is so engrossed in its own
mythos, that it actually takes itself seriously. This becomes apparent
as haunting cathedral choir musical adorns the madness with Gothic
foreboding. All the while, we&#39;re shaking our head wondering why Duffy
isn&#39;t capable of accepting the ridiculousness of his own creation.
Heck, even porn star Ron Jeremy enters the fray, but the movie doesn&#39;t
pause to giggle&#151;instead it continuously plugs along with repetitive and
ruthless abandon. It seems that Duffy actually believes that not only
is what the MacManus brothers doing right&#151;but that it is actually
possible. In that sense, &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; is like the elephant in
the room&#151;the dinner party guess who fails to get the big joke. And, not
surprisingly, the audience isn&#39;t laughing.
