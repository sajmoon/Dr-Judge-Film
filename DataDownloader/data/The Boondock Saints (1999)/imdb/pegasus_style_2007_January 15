The laughingly bad scene of how the two brothers help each other escape
the Russian mafia lair after they&#39;re held captive is like a case of a
bad director without a budget or creativity, so it just cuts to
flashbacks all the time as a failed means to plug in the huge holes.
(Then again, there are so many bad scenes like this its like a cross
between Death Wish and Plan Nine from Outer Space.) Although one area
that Plan Nine didn&#39;t have was shameless product placement. Did you see
so many Pepsi cans being drunk at the breakfast table by these two
Boondock &quot;Sugar Saints?&quot; How apparent was it that the director Troy
Duffy (who does a horrible cameo appearance of himself at the Irish bar
in the beginning of the movie, acting like an ugly midget from a gay
porno movie) blew the money for the film on partying and ended up with
half the time of the film just of guys getting drunk on camera and
shouting the f-word louder and louder (like ornery obnoxious drunks,
which is what Troy must have been while making this abomination of a
stinker). If you&#39;re searching for a good movie in this much, watch
&quot;Overnight,&quot; the documentary on the making of the film which shows Troy
Duffy&#39;s ego running havoc and he&#39;s reduced to yelling at himself while
flat-down drunk on a street corner.<br /><br />Sure there&#39;s some of his paid people that come on here and now try to
sell it as a cult film (more like Jonestown Cult). They&#39;ve also been
talking for years of a sequel, although the only appropriate actors for
the directorial phlegm that Duffy dishes would be to have the &quot;Saints&quot;
replayed by Tom Green in a &quot;Freedie got Fingered&quot; style role, whipping
out his member and Troy trying to find some Gaelic-orchestral music
with bad gun blanks to make it seem divine.
