I realise a lot of people like this movie, but I have a really hard
time understanding why. The script is clich&eacute;d and absurd, the fight
scenes resemble a slapstick comedy, the acting is thoroughly amateurish
and the direction is clumsy.<br /><br />However, the real problems with this movie are two things 1) The
bizarre central theme that promotes vigilante justice without exploring
any of the negative side effects and 2) The seeming intention of the
film makers to insult every minority group they can think of with
ridiculous stereotypes, overblown accents and awkward set pieces, the
crowning glory of which is the final montage.<br /><br />This movie came highly recommended to me, but it played out like a
seriously second rate knock off of the much better &quot;Lock Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels&quot;. Even the usually awesome Billy Connelly failed to
raise this film, as his legendary comedic talents went completely
unused.
