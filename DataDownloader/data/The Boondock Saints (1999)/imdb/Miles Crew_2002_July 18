It's true that this film is probably a rare gem among straight-to-video
action movies, but that doesn't mean it's good. In general, it feels cheap
and sloppy; the soundtrack is mostly terrible electronic music, the dialogue
seems to substitute excessive use of &quot;the f-word&quot; for wit, and the action
scenes- which are also far less abundant than some reviews would have you
believe- substitute endless slow-motion (some of which does actually look
pretty good) for creative choreography. The  structure that is used
throughout the film- Willem Dafoe finds bodies, figures out what happened,
and then we see it- basically robs the movie of any suspense or tension
since all the &quot;action&quot; scenes happen in flashbacks. And naturally there are
more fundamental problems, like the thinness of the story and characters and
the fact that the film lacks a point and doesn't offer up enough
entertainment to distract from this fact. Overall- not painful or a complete
waste of time, but not deserving of its cult status.
