It's lucky for Troy Duffy that he managed to sabotage his own
production and ensure that his film developed a reputation that
preceded itself, if it had been released and judged on its merits alone
then it's highly likely this film would have slithered off into
obscurity mere weeks after its release.<br /><br />From the shoddy acting to the pretentious tacked on biblical aspect of
the plot everything about this film displays a writer and director with
far more ambition than talent. The script isn't funny in places where
it's intended to be, but is absolutely hilarious when it's being
serious. In terms of production Duffy tries to throw gritty gangster
film in with stylish action movie but just ends up with scenes that
don't flow together at all. The overused &quot;fade to black&quot; cuts between
scenes don't help this problem in the slightest, in fact all they
manage is to remind the viewer of an episode of Law &amp; Order. Even the
subtitles on this film are badly designed.<br /><br />However none of this is the worse aspect of the film, that honour must
go to the characterisation. The overblown New York cop and mafia
persona's combined with stereotypically Irish drunks give the
impression of NYPD blue crossed with an episode of Father Ted, the
Irish bar owner in particular is a direct rip off of Father Jack. On
top of this the Irish accents of the two main characters are awful. The
attempts at adding quirkiness to most of the characters are cack-handed
at best and simply makes them seem unbelievable and at times
embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />The only possible saving grace for The Boondock Saints is the plot idea
of not showing the various set pieces within the standard chronology of
the narrative but only revealing them after the detectives have
theorised on what happened. However, the makers obviously exhausted
their creativity with this trick and the continuous repetition of what
might have otherwise been an interesting plot device just kills it's
novelty and leaves the middle of the film languishing with no real
direction.<br /><br />If you do have the misfortune to see this film then I highly recommend
watching the documentary of it's production (Overnight, 2003)
afterwards, as the funniest thing about this atrocious piece of cinema
is the utterly misplaced egotism of it's creator.
