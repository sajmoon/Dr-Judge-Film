	I hadn't heard a word about this film before some of my friends mentioned
how great it was and advised me to see it. So I took their advice and rented
it soon after. Currently, the day after seeing it, I can think of very few
qualities that made this film worth watching. It was obvious to whom this
film tried to appeal, young men, ages 15-22 who think that nothing would be
better than to roam the streets killing `bad guys'. Unfortunately, many of
my friends fit this description. 
	In general the film was overdone. It simply tried to shock the viewer with
profound amounts of outlandish violence, extended periods of extreme
language, and by making one of the main characters gay, in a disturbing sort
of way. The inclusion of Ron Jeremy destroyed any slight credibility that
the film may have strived to achieve as the mere sight of him makes me want
to shoot myself in the head. It was no surprise that he was the only
character in the film to engage in sexual activity (in front of the camera,
as there is other sexual activity implied in the movie, e.g. Willem Dafoe's
character, agent Smecker, sleeping with his flamboyant male lover) Other
moments were downright embarrassing, such as when Smecker first makes an
appears as the super cool FBI Agent who's intellect is, of course, far
superior than that of the individuals in the Boston Homicide Unit initially
investigating the murder scene. The most ridiculous part of the scene is
when Smecker investigates the scene while swaying to opera music, and closes
the crime within seconds. Madness. The next most ridiculous scene is the
shootout between the old man who is released from prison to kill the Saints
and the Saints themselves. The scene consists of the Saints, their friend
Rocco, and the old man shooting at each other at point blank range for
several painfully unrealistic minutes and the four men walking away from the
skirmish with mere scratches. Ridiculous. 
	Not only did the outlandish scenes get on my nerves, but so did the entire
religious message that the movie painted. It's interesting how the Saints,
being the cold blooded killers that they were, were so religious as to pray
over the bodies of the men that they brutally killed. O and the prayers that
they recited over and over and over were nothing but an annoyance while they
were intended to be poetic and beautiful.  
	Overall, this film is a waste of time for anyone who has realized that
there is more to life than Metal Gear Solid and Grand Theft Auto 3.<br /><br />
