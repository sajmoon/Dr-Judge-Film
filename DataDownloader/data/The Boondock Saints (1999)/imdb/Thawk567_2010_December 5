And Sheppard&#x27;s we shall be, for thee my lord for thee, Power hath
descended from thy hand that our feet will may swiftly carry out thy
command. So we shall flow a river forth to thee, and teaming with souls
shall it ever be. In Nomine Patris, et Fillii, et Spiritus Sancti. This
prayer is the signature prayer in which both Connor and Murphy MacManus
say before they execute the damned. I tell even though I have only been
a fan of the saints for a few short months now, I feel like a huge die
hard fan. I even have there coat that they wear. I would here how great
the film was from by great friend Matt, how good the film was, then I
finally watched about two months ago, and now it is one of my favorite
movies ever.<br /><br />The movie takes place in Boston, where there is probably millions of
Irish folk there. There just happens to be two brothers in particular,
who seek out the evil of Boston and hunt them down at all costs. I
thought this was a great idea. So did Troy Duffy, Troy is the director,
writer and creator of the Saints. Troy apparently wrote the script at
this bar he had been working for at the time. Some director came to the
bar one particular night and helped Troy begin the Saint movies.<br /><br />I personally think this film deserved more credit then it was handed.
The movie did not receive a nomination for any award whatsoever, witch
I think is ludicrous, that movie deserved at least some recognition. I
thought Sean Patrick Flannery did an excellent job as well as Norman
Reedus as the MacManus brothers. Anyways I highly recommend watching
this movie, it is simply awesome. 9 out of 10.
