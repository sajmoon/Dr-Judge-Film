Boondock Saints has the dubious distinction of being a film that
virtually
every adolescent male with a bloodlust fantasy falls in love with while
at
the same time being a really terrible piece of moviemaking. It's a sad
bastardization of the films of Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone and of course,
Quentin Tarantino. The plot is beyond ridiculous, concerning two bad
actors
with bad accents who spend most of the movie executing mobsters and
reciting
pseudo Irish prayer crap and being followed by a gayfornoapparentreason
detective who decides that maybe they aren't so bad after all. Willem
Dafoe
(an on and off actor to begin with) seems to have stolen his performance
from Gary Oldman in The Professional. If you liked this movie, please go
rent Straw Dogs or A Fistful of Dollars or Hard Eight or any other
gangster/vengeance film that doesn't suck and then get a life. Beware of
any
film in which a character delivers a line like `for a few minutes this
place
was Armageddon' with a straight face.
