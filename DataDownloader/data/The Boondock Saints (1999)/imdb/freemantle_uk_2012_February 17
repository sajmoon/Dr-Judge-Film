There is big divide of opinion between critics and audiences about The
Boondock Saints: critics hated the film when it first critics hated it
and The Boondock Saints has a 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but
audiences loved it, having a 7.8/10 on IMDb and has become a cult hit.
But I side with the critics about this film and there are some
detractors even in audiences.<br /><br />Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) are
two Irish Catholic brothers living in Boston and workers in a meat
packing factory. After an altercation with a copy of Russian gangsters
the brothers have to kill in self-defence. They soon discover their
have a talent for killing and put it to good use to get rid of all the
evil of the world, killing gangsters, perverts, rapists, murderers,
etc&#x85; and believe they are doing God&#x27;s work. But by doing this they
upset the Russian and Italian mafias and an FBI agent, Paul Smecker
(Willem Dafoe) is investigating their crimes.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is basically a poor man&#x27;s Quentin Tarantino/Guy
Ritchie film, failing to match on a plot, comedy, action and dialogue
level. The acting throughout is horrendous, either lacking any
conviction or very over the top, though Dafoe did at least looked like
he was having fun. The action was filmed in a slightly stylised fashion
and competently handled but Troy Duffy overused slow motion like he was
Guy Ritchie or John Woo but did not have their experience. The actions
are not even filmed as they were happening, they were filmed as
flashbacks and Duffy just fares to black to show a show the passing of
time which felt very lazy. The gunplay was strong.<br /><br />The jokes, comedy and the comic performances just fell flat. It was
poorly written, not funny and the dialogue was a poor attempt at
copying Tarantino and Ritchie. There is no real understanding how to
make a action-comedy. There are tonal shifts from it trying to be a
light hearted romp to being a very violence dark fest, an example being
the brothers kill their targets gangland style, shooting them in the
back of the head at point blank range. The MacManus use religion to
justify there actions and there is a very right wing slant to this
film. It would have worked better if the brothers were villains, using
religion to justify their actions, manipulating religious text as a
justification and the police have to investigate.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is not the almighty classic that some people think
it is. It is a poor comedy, over stylised though some of the action set
pieces do save it.
