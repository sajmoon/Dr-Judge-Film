The Boondock Saints - Review<br /><br />OK, I looked up this film here on IMDb to surely see everyone giving
this &quot;film&quot; the same type of bad review I am giving it. I was shocked
to see that there are many out there who claim to love this film. How
can that be? Did I unknowingly fall asleep after the opening credits
and dream a really bad movie? I must have for my &quot;dream&quot; had so many
things wrong with it. <br /><br />I will have to disagree with some of the people on here and say that in
my opinion Willem Dafoe did not do a bad job of acting at all. He was
unfortunately just badly directed. I find Mr. Dafoe to be a very
skillful actor to be quite honest. The actors who played the two
brothers I think did a good job for what they were given as well but
that is where the accolades stop. The Italian &quot;funny&quot; guy who joined
the brothers as well as the dumb, young detective were the true
definition of bad casting and over acting - WAY over acting. I am a fan
of Billy Connelly but do not feel this was the right role for him to
break his usual comedic ways. Not that I felt he did a bad acting job
at all, just that he was not given the on screen time and direction for
him to display his talent. I know he has now been cast to reprise his
role in All Saints with a more prevalent showing but with such a bad
first film and a part two without Mr. Dafoe, I feel Mr.Connelly's
talent and time will be wasted with this role. OK, back to bad
casting... the rest of the cast was horrible. Yes, that's right I said
it! Not just bad... horrible! Do you blame the actors? No, not all. You
blame the casting director and the producers for green-lighting their
choices. I mean really... Ron Jeremy? Give me a break! If a pretty face
like Traci Lords can't successfully make it out of the porn world, what
makes you think this hedgehog can? Also, can anyone tell me what making
Mr. Dafoes character gay did to help the story? Could he have not been
a great detective who enjoyed opera music without having him be gay?
All that dancing in the alley and in front of the house was just too
much. Shame on you Mr. Duffy! <br /><br />Alright I know I should stop now with this review but cannot as there
are so many holes in the story as well. If these two brothers turned
themselves in to the police in the beginning for killing those two
Russian goons, then why was it so damn hard for anyone to figure out
who was killing the REST of the Russian mafia? Supposedly the Boston
P.D. in this film is beyond stupid but THAT stupid? I recommend the
city of Boston view this movie and consider banning Mr. Duffy from
filming there again. So, OK, I'll go along though just for kicks.
Boston is stupid and can't figure it out, OK.... but what about
Detective Dafoe? So smart yet so naive? It just does not make sense.
The only reason in my opinion that the director and writer, Mr. Troy
Duffy, plotted it so is only to fill the hour and a half he needed to.
This film ended when the brothers walked into the police station. The
next hour and fifteen minutes were a waste of film, time (mine
included), and money. <br /><br />I read in another persons review that this movie kept them on the edge
of their seat. Well, I will have to agree, it did me too but only
because I was handcuffed.<br /><br />I hope I have given you a glimpse into this horribly acted, poorly
casted, badly written Tarintino rip-off. As much as I have written on
it, it is just that, a glimpse. I can only recommend this as a fun
venture ... to find some of the many other flaws I did not list. If you
are a student of film and action/drama is your calling, then please
watch this so you will have an example of what to stay clear of.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and maybe I have possibly stopped you from
seeing this and saved you some of yours.<br /><br />Have a great day! Robb Wood robbwood@msn.com
