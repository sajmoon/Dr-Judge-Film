2005_October 22 
This is the worst piece of rubbish I have seen in quite a while. I
cannot believe there are morons giving this ratings above 1, let alone
the 7.8 that is currently its status. The acting in this was absolutely
appalling, the story was vaguely interesting but very poorly executed
and quite frankly I want my 2 hours back. It was as if the director
came up with a bunch of original characters but tried to fit in too
many for one movie. And I guess he must have been influenced by
Tarantino's style judging by how the movie jumps around the place, but
for me it just looked pathetic. I would almost like to give this movie
a 2 just for the scene with the cat in the flat as that did make me
laugh, but again, this is clearly borrowed from Pulp Fiction and the
fact that I have now even had to mention one of the best movies around
in the same paragraph as this movie makes me angry. I am horrified to
see there is a sequel.
