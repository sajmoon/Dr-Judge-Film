This film serves a great purpose: whenever someone tells me that they
love Boondock Saints, I feel justified in ignoring everything else they
have to say about cinema. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The
only people that have ever said anything positive about this movie have
been highschoolers that don&#39;t know anything about cinema.<br /><br />This movie isn&#39;t entertaining to me, but that&#39;s a subjective claim.
This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal. It&#39;s about
vigilante justice (70s crime movies anyone? Dirty Harry? French
Connection? They all do it better.). It&#39;s about Irish-Catholic violence
in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays
this theme more powerfully). It has characters marked with meaningful
tattooes (Belly, Memento). It includes a cross-dressing detective
(David Duchovny in Twin Peaks? What was that, 15 years earlier?). It
depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction). This
movie was so unremarkable and derivative that I can&#39;t even remember
more things to criticize.<br /><br />On a final note, it&#39;s just not a cool movie. The things that the
filmmakers and the appreciative audiences think are cool are just not.
The violence is sluggishly portrayed. The gay detective is just a
caricature of an emphatic queen (unlike Gay Perry in Kiss Kiss Bang
Bang). The whole movie sucks. There is nothing to like about this that
hasn&#39;t been done a million times better in other films.
