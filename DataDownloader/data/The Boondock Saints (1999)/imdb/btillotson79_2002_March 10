It was so horrible it was a joy to watch.  I recommend this to everyone
and
no one.  The whole thing is one big paradox.  Surreal, as if there was a
punch bowl of assorted drugs, from which every cast member took something
different and then shot the film. Absolute genius. I have not laughed like
that since the Lard Ass scene from Stand By Me. It was an hour and fifty
minute bellow of pure guttaral melody ejaculating from my throat.
Brilliant
is a word thrown around too much, but this strip of celluloid redefines
that
very word.  I will never wash these eyes again, for I have seen the
masterpiece of all cinema ever last. This movie must be
seen.
