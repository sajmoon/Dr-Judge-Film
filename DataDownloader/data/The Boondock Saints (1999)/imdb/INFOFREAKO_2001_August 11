I have a  rule - any video which contains blurbs comparing it to either
'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction' will a) be NOTHING like Tarantino, and b)
will absolutely suck. 'The Boondock Saints' gets compared to BOTH movies on
its sleeve, and doesn't break my rule. This movie is so unbelievably awful
IN EVERY WAY that your jaw will drop on the floor. I can't think of ANY
redeeming feature it has! The script is an absolute mess. The characters are
totally unbelievable, the situations ridiculous, the &quot;witty&quot; dialogue
stinks, there is no character development, suspense, laughs or anything
worthwhile going on here. <br /><br />To add insult to injury, it is incoherently directed which makes an
uninteresting story and characters even more difficult to care about. After
half an hour I'd had enough. The two leads (Flanery and Reedus) have
particularly poor Irish accents that they can't even sustain throughout, and
how the usually great Willem Dafoe ended up in this abortion of a movie is
anybody's guess! <br /><br />Steer clear of 'The Boondock Saints'. I can't even see undiscerning teenage
action fans enjoying this. Frankly I can't see ANYBODY enjoying this!! One
of the worst movies I've EVER watched.
