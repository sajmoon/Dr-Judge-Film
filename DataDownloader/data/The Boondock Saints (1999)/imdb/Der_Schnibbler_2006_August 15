Two Irish brothers decide to cleanse the city with a bit of good old
vigilante justice.<br /><br />Everything about this film is so generic as to be embarrassing. The
cops are utter fools, the main guy on the case is some homosexual FBI
agent who listens to opera on headphones while investigating crime
scenes (he closes his eyes to &quot;take in&quot; the music), and our two heroes
recite Bible verses before shooting someone execution style. If you
think that last one is dramatic, don&#39;t. They sound more like two
buffoons than any kind of divine force of justice. In fact, they are
the most irritating duo of good-hearted criminals since Bud Spencer and
Terence Hill. They also speak over four languages, because they &quot;paid
attention in school.&quot; <br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for a serious film dealing with villains turning to
unwitting heroes, watch &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; which this film amply
&quot;references&quot; quite often. (In one scene a character &quot;accidentally&quot;
shoots a cat -- cue exclamations of surprise by teenage audience.)
Otherwise, skip this ridiculous film and ignore the praise given it.
Only testosterone-charged fifteen-year-olds and grown men whose
emotional development corresponds to one would ever be impressed by
this tripe.
