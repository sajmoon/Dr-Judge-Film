The Boondock Saints, a power trip macho-vigilante flick from 1999 has
become a bit of a cult item within a very specific crowd. Why? Who
knows, cult movies are not always good movies by default. Boondock is
by far one of the most worthless movie that could had ever get any kind
of following whatsoever. Let&#x27;s skip right away the vigilante agenda
going on, which goes without saying that is silly and one dimensional
beyond belief. Let&#x27;s even skip all the poorly made attempts of &#x22;black
humour&#x22;, which for Troy Duffy just consists of having the &#x22;heroes&#x22;
molesting corpses of females, saying the f word a million times and
using a toilet as a weapon in the most improbable way you could think
of.<br /><br />No no no, forget all that, what it boils down to it&#x27;s this: Boondock
Saints is not a fun movie to watch, at all. Duffy thinks he&#x27;s John Woo
in his prime, and decided to shot every single shooting sequence in
this mess in SLOOOOOOOOW MOTION, making it a complete bore to watch the
same gimmick over and over. There&#x27;s never any tension whatsoever in any
of the confrontations, the &#x22;heroes&#x22; just blast everything and everyone
without any effort. Then there&#x27;s the second gimmick, Dafoe&#x27;s character
pretty much just telling you what happen in each scene, and then show
us a flashback of said scenes, with even moooooore sloooow motion. It&#x27;s
like if the movie was repeating itself to just cover the fact that the
plot is invisible, an insult to your intelligence, that the action is
sub-par and that the whole movie has no reason to exist other than bore
you to death with it&#x27;s absurd fetish of violence and it&#x27;s &#x22;unique&#x22;
sense of humour.<br /><br />There&#x27;s just so much stuff to point out, i&#x27;ll just throw one more
example right away: there&#x27;s a scene where our two &#x22;heroes&#x22; and a third
character are shooting each other within a very small range of
distance. They never hit each other, at all, really. This is some
Godfrey Ho level of silliness going on, and even Godfrey&#x27;s movies can
be enjoyable out of their sheer will to ham it up. BS on the other hand
takes all this stuff so dead serious, this is no parody, no spoof
whatsoever of the dumb clich&#xE9;s of the action genre. The movie is 100%
sure that it has created a &#x22;cool&#x22; action piece, and that it&#x27;s
pro-vigilante/religious fanaticism message is something to be taken
seriously.<br /><br />There&#x27;s nothing to like here, not even in an &#x22;ironic&#x22; way. The humour
is Family Guy level of comedy, the plot just a mess, and the direction
the disaster i just described. It&#x27;s a movie that will remain buried in
the sewers of bad cinema, and for the better.
