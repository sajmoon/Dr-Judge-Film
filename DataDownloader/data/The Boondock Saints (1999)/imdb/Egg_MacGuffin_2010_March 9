If someone ever told me to name the top 5 absolute WORST movies ever
made, the first one I would think of is this worthless piece of
amateurish filth.<br /><br />Honestly, there is not one single redeeming quality of this entire
&#x22;film&#x22;. Directed and written by a sped who knows less than nothing
about directing and writing, the cinematography is dull and ugly,
acting is some of the most awful I have ever seen (and yes, I did see
Cyber Tracker 2), etc. Not to mention that this movie is not funny at
all, not even by accident.<br /><br />Well, now that I think of it, there might be one good thing to come out
of this vomit-inducing bore-fest. If you somehow manage to make it
completely through this crap from start to finish, then you have seen
the worst movie ever made. You can now watch Michael Bay movies with a
big smile on your face, thinking &#x22;hell, this ain&#x27;t so bad!&#x22; But me, I&#x27;d
rather try sneezing with my eyes open than have to suffer this kind of
agony again.<br /><br />The only reason why I somehow managed to do the impossible and watch
this from start to finish is because I was in a state of physical shock
after seeing how incredibly awful it was. No word of lie...I watched
this for the first (and only) time with 4 friends who all claimed that
it was great. They all fell asleep within the first 30 minutes...and we
watched it in the day time.<br /><br />That being said, this is nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of
having a 400 pound man with chronic diarrhea squat over your open mouth
for a full two hours. If you are ever so incredibly bored one day and
decide to watch this, take my word for it...do anything else at all. Go
down to Taco Bell and sift through the dumpster outside for the food
they throw away...and eat all of it. It will be a lot more healthy,
satisfying, and a lot less likely to cause gastrointestinal
cramps...and chronic diarrhea.<br /><br />Troy Duffy should quit film-making and find something that he&#x27;s
actually good at.
