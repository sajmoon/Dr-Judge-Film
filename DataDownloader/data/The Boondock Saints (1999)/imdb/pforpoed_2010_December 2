By 1999, the Tarantino ripoffs were in full swing. This is a movie by a
filmmaker who knows a particular style and sticks to it without really
bringing anything fresh to the party. If you don&#x27;t know the premise, go
read it on the IMDb page. Suffice to say, the performance by Willem
Dafoe as a homosexual Federal investigator is one of the films saving
graces. A rather shocking and brutal moment when a cat is accidentally
killed (nay, splattered against a wall) was the point where I almost
turned this film off. I wish I had. What started out as an interesting
premise turned into a rather plodding hike to its somewhat clich&#xE9;d
conclusion.
