This is another of the Tarantino obsessive genre films that pays far
too much attention to Tarantino's strategic use of obscenities in
dialogue and his intermittent extreme violence. Tarantino knows how to
insert these unusual elements in order to add depth and force to
different aspects of his film, especially the characters. But these
elements themselves do not comprise the genius of Tarantino, rather
they are only a small part. &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; is 2 hours of
constant obscenity and violence, never pausing to explore a character,
or contrast the mood of the film. Every scene however is loud, bloody,
and shallow. The film's philosophical premise is strong, analyzing the
nuances of vigilante justice, but nuance and complexity are very
difficult to discover when the characters are so simple and distracted
by the frequency of extreme words and action. Tarantino is a favorite
of mine, and I'm sorry I had to use him in the same sentences as this
movie.
