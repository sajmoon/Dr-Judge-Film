Reading the comments made by others, I wonder if we saw the same
film.
This movie is terrible. The acting is poor. Several of the characters have
accents that are all over the place. The characters in general are shallow
sketches. Willem Dafoe goes way over the top.
The il Duce character is a strange cross between Hannibal Lecter and Leon
(The Professional) that just doesn't work.<br /><br />Many of the characters' actions seem unmotivated and there is quite a lot
that is never really explained.
Early on we discover that the MacManus boys are fluent in many languages
and
the FBI agent asks why educated guys like that are working in a meat
packing
plant. We never get an answer. And why have these characters be
multilingual? It serves no purpose.<br /><br />Even their motivation for wanting to clean up the streets is not made
believable.<br /><br />See La Femme Nikita. See The Professional. See State of
Grace.
Don't see this film unless you want to see a hapless cat get splattered
and
watch Ron Jeremy with his clothes on.<br /><br />
