Boondock Saints seems to be mixing styles of Guy Ritchie&#x27;s twisted
British crime stories with funny characters, some of Quentin Tarantino
style dialogue and violence (although only the Unrated version is
bloody) and loooots of strong language.<br /><br />As the language goes, I have to say that I&#x27;ve seen lots of movies with
much higher F-word count, but there seems to be a huge difference
between an F-word and an F-word. As long as &#x22;Fu*k! Sh*t!&#x22; bartender
scenes are super funny some of Funny Man&#x27;s language is just hard to
listen to. But enough with that.<br /><br />As the movie goes, it is often compared to Pulp Fiction but the only
major similarity I can find is a prayer before killing someone.
Boondock Saints don&#x27;t have the intelligence of Tarantino&#x27;s writing at
all, some dialogues are funny but non of them are that brilliantly
written as Pulp Fiction&#x27;s screenplay.<br /><br />The showing of the story reminds me of Ritchie&#x27;s &#x22;Snatch&#x22; - I have to
say it is funny to watch both what happened and how the detective
thinks it did. There is some hilarious scenes on the way, like the rope
one, and some that are really well directed and filmed!<br /><br />Willem Dafoe&#x27;s acting is really good although I did not like that role
that much (espiecially the ending costume part), while the rest of the
cast is just good. Nothing stunning for sure.<br /><br />Overall, Boondock Saints is a fun movie, for adults, that seems to be a
mix of various styles and a parody of some and that has some good parts
but also some pretty big flaws or parts that just could have been than
so much better.
