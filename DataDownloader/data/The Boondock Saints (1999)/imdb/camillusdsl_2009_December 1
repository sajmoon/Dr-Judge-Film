Normally any movie with a good score on IMDb is worth watching, so I
sat down to enjoy &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; expecting enjoyable action. The
first thing that made me worry was the opening scene, which is set in
what is presumably a Roman Catholic Church. There was obviously no
effort whatsoever made to ensure that the service was accurately
portrayed (for example -the Lord&#x27;s Prayer which is recited was not the
Catholic version, but the reformist &#x22;Protestant&#x22; one, which is never
used in a Roman Catholic service). If filmmakers decide to set a plot
in any particular geographical location or ethnic community they should
show at least enough respect to get the basics right. This on its own
is a minor point but it was only the beginning and should have warned
me about what was to come. It seems that the only reason that the main
characters are Irish is to fulfil the necessary religious link needed
by the movie title, by using the stereotypical off-the-shelf Irish
Catholic, hard drinking, hard fighting but with a heart of gold model.
It would have been far better to have done without the painful attempts
at an &#x22;Oirish&#x22; accent which were amongst the worst since &#x22;Finian&#x27;s
Rainbow&#x22; and painful to an Irish ear. (If you want to see how it is
possible for non-Irish actors to get the accent perfect watch &#x22;The
Proposition&#x22;.) All of these faults aside the movie could still have
been entertaining. Unfortunately the plot is so weak and predictable
that not even an actor of the quality of Willem Dafoe could save it. I
had to struggle with the desire to switch this movie off after the
first twenty minutes, something I almost never do. There are a lot of
movies in this genre and my advice is to pick a different one &#x96;
especially if you&#x27;re Irish.
