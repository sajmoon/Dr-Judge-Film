I've been told this film's gained something close to cult status over
the past 6 years and I fail to see why. The main problem lies in
Dafoe's character, who descends into an outrageous cross-dressing
cartoon once he begins to sympathize with the boys. Woefully thin
stuff--- because this isn't a comedy and it's certainly not a murder
mystery (making a &quot;spoiler&quot; virtually impossible). Plot-wise, it just
plain sucks. Technically, there's some slightly redeeming aspects. The
camera work is very good and there's a visually clever insertion of
Dafoe placing himself in the midst of a crime scene. The casting of
chubby porn star Ron Jeremy (Hyatt) as a Russian (?) mafioso is less
than inspired--- he's more cartoony than Dafoe. And amid the script
that goes nowhere, there's one or two well-written lines but
ultimately, this is a complete waste of time. This goes up near the top
of my list of all-time worst movies. Awful!
