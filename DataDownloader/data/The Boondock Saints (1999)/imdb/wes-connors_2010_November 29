&#x22;When the sadistic Russian mob starts muscling in on their South Boston
Irish neighborhood, Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and
Norman Reedus) know what must be done. Feeling that the vengeance of
God is flowing through their veins, they set out to rid the streets of
gangsters, criminals, and lowlifes. As the body count rises, the
brothers became local heroes. Now, one unorthodox FBI agent must be
cunning enough to bring them down,&#x22; according to the film&#x27;s
distributor.<br /><br />Trouble is, detective Willem Dafoe (as Paul Smecker) agrees with the
vigilantes! &#x85;and so would you, as evidenced in the film&#x27;s coda.<br /><br />Troy Duffy&#x27;s &#x22;The Boomtown Saints&#x22; challenges the Catholic Church&#x27;s
observance of the &#x22;Thou shalt not kill&#x22; commandment. It&#x27;s an
effectively stated thesis, but not new. The violent style is
reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s groundbreaking &#x22;Reservoir Dogs&#x22;
(1992). Indeed, you&#x27;re advised you will &#x22;thrill to the action,
intensity and intelligence of this modern day morality tale written in
blood&#x22; if you took pleasure in lying with &#x22;Dogs&#x22;. One of the gory
highlights involves a hot iron, but with no sizzle.<br /><br />The nicely-cast brothers could have stood a little more
characterization. Coming on like a masculine David Bowie, Mr. Dafoe
telegraphs his character&#x27;s big secret (if it is one, hard to tell) too
early; he keeps his ties clean, too. With an uncanny ability to make
hair-conscious henchman Ron Jeremy and hungry mob boss Carlo Rota laugh
at bad jokes, &#x22;funnyman&#x22; David Della Rocco and the crew have enough fun
to make it occasionally contagious - if you like catching this sort of
sickness.<br /><br />***** The Boondock Saints (8/4/99) Troy Duffy ~ Willem Dafoe, Sean
