There is something about combining dirty accents and guns that can make
anyone cool. The ending and a couple scenes could of been a little more
eventful, but other than that, it was a great movie. The brothers or
&#x22;the Saints&#x22; were played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus.
These two were just the meaning of cool. There were some side
characters also who really knew how to to act. One in general is Willem
Dafoe. He really took control of his character. Now Billy Connolly was
in it shortly too and he was also pretty good even though he did get a
big speaking part. The movie combines killing with the Lord. The only
people the Saints are killing though are bad Mafia type guys. Once they
are done, they say a prayer in their native language and put pennies on
their eyes laying them to rest. Like a good guy, bad guy feel. The way
the movie was filmed was fantastic. They would show the dead bodies
killed by the Saints, then Willem Dafoe would say, &#x22;this is how it
happened&#x22; leading into a flashback showing everything. The movie added
some humor also because of the way people got killed. Nothing started
right for the Saints, but in the end they did end up killing the guys
they needed. The weak minded towards bad language would not enjoy the
film because it has some pretty crude dialog, but it does fit well with
the film if you know the culture. Overall, this film almost makes you
want a gun for the Boondock Saints makes it look so easy to use one.
But probably wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing.
