2006_June 2 
I just saw this on DVD, and can&#39;t think of enough bad things to say
about it: it was made in 1999 apparently, and must have marked the
tipping point of Willem Dafoe&#39;s descent into buffoonery...his gay FBI
agent&#39;s poncing around is an insult to his craft and I can only wonder
that the crew were being told what to do by him and not the other way
round. As for David del Rocco, well he must have been an investor in
the film, because no sensible casting director would give him a job
mowing lawns otherwise, he&#39;s about as funny as a rectal tumour.Add in
dreadful direction, awful acting from the entire cast, stupid script,
pathetic plot, ridiculous accents etc etc, and you have a waste of
celluloid that has made me feel like disinfecting the screen I saw it
on. I can&#39;t believe that people actually put up money to make this
rotten muck, I&#39;ve seen better movies with Wings Hauser in them..totally
vile, cinematic putrescence...avoid like the plague-ridden thing it is.
