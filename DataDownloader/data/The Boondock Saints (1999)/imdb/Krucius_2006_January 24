My friend and I were talking on the phone one day and I remember most
of the conversation was him telling me how great this Boondock Saints
movie was, so I tell him to bring it over so I can watch it, and
frankly, I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />The movie was basically another gun-ho action movie to me. I wasn't
into the whole religion and cleansing the world of evil crap, or maybe
there's more to it then that? I pretty much assume the plot is two
brothers suddenly deciding to kill all evil, so they get a bunch of
guns and some rope. Throughout the movie they go on a bunch of missions
to kill drug dealers, gangsters, mob bosses, etc. Overall I didn't see
anything in this movie that should give it a 7.7. Id just give it a 5.
