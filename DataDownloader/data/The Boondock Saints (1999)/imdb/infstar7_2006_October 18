Almost every young (18-28) Caucasian male I&#39;ve encountered rates this
as one of there all time favorite movies and not to sound prejudiced
but is it just a &quot;White thing&quot;? I think this movie was very exxagerated
and what&#39;s with all the homosexual overtones. The sight of Wilem Dafoe
in drag is really disturbing. I think it would of been a great movie
even if Wilem Dafoe was straight. I don&#39;t care whether he was gay or
not but it just seems very unnecessary. Furthermore, you mean to tell
me that the brothers didn&#39;t know that they were having a shootout
against their own father?. This movie is mediocre at best.I understand
it&#39;s just a movie and its art blah,blah,blah but come on now. People
say that this is one of the greatest movies they&#39;ve ever seen and I
just don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m missing. I love great movies, Ilove good
movies and I love some movies that are okay but this one sucks!
