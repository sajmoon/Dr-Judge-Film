2005_July 10 
Let me start off by saying that I did not see the whole movie. I missed
a part of the middle but the rest I watched completely. I should also
say that I'm a pretty big Tarantino fan. This movie was awful in every
regard. I can see people calling it a cult film for the so bad it is
good reason, but calling it classic and original is miles away from the
truth.<br /><br />You name it this film did it terribly. It was terribly directed by
newcomer Troy Duffy. Every seen almost came off as comic
unintentionally and inserting the religious message made this film even
more bad(not that I have anything against religion). This movie is an
abomination to religion. The Pope would be vomiting. This might have
been one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen. It is so annoying.
I can imagine the director going &quot; ooh I want to be cool like Tarantino
and make it time twisting.&quot; Give me a break. The acting had nothing to
offer. I found the two leads to be not very good and miscast. The scene
that tries to be poetic( trust me, you will know) had a very good idea
go to complete waste. The action scenes were some of the worst I have
ever seen in my life. It is too painful too describe. The film arrives
at one of the dumbest conclusions ever. Please, let the sequel get
caned.<br /><br />Never see this movie.
