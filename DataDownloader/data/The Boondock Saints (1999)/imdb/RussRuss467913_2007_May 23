This movie is garbage. Yeah it has blood and swearing but so do a lot
of other films. It does feature a giant helping of a moronic
moralizing. All and all its basically a d grade pulp fiction knock off
with a bunch of crappy stars that are graced by the presence of Willem
Dafoe who turns in a crappy performance. Also the film features one of
the worst 3rd act twists in recent film history. i would have given
this movie maybe a 4 but the twist is so stupid that it basically pee&#39;s
on the entire film. This is a film that is much adored by a certain
type of unknowing film goer who expects little and gets little from a
movie going experience. if you are a serious film goer skip this movie.
