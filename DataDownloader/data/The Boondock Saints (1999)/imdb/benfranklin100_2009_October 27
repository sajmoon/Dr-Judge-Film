A homo-erotic mess that trips over its own britches right from the
starting gate. This film was made in some kind of hermetically sealed
Hollywood logic-free zone. If you just want to get drunk and watch
people get shot, it does the trick--even delivering a few laughs in the
process, but don&#x27;t expect it to make any sense at all. It has a plot as
thin as onion soup, and a menagerie of totally detestable, and
thoroughly brain-dead characters, who just kind of wander around like a
murderous Beavis and Butthead while the law, lead by DeFoe the prancing
meat-head detective (whom we are expected to look upon as some sort of
genius) and his minions of even bigger meat-head cops, pursue said
troublemakers despite the fact that the killers already turned
themselves in for some unknown reason, and were released by the
meat-heads. . .WHAT? I guess they had to kill some time to prevent this
plot less wonder from being 48 minutes long.<br /><br />Mega-TRD. Do not rent.
