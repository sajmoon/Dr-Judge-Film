Troy Duffy takes all of the tired action movie clich&#xE9;s of the last few
decades, together with some obvious motifs borrowed (read: ripped off)
from Leon and some of the Tarantino movies, and constructs quite simply
the most extraneous &#x27;addition&#x27; to the genre of gangster movies ever
conceived.<br /><br />If you&#x27;ve heard good things about this movie, the people who told you
had NO taste. A far, far better option would be to watch the
documentary &#x27;Overnight&#x27; about Troy Duffy, the writer and director of
this movie - one of the most obnoxious and delusional slackers ever
(I&#x27;ve never seen someone&#x27;s opinion of their own talent so vastly
inflated!).<br /><br />Unless you are Irish, unimaginative, unoriginal, and want a senseless
and nonsensical low-budget action movie - in other words, unless you
ARE Troy Duffy - you&#x27;d be wise to skip this completely.
