2004_January 20 

This movie was pretty bad.  Cliches abound, the characters come nowhere near
to ringing true, the story is downright silly, the screenplay must have
looked awful on paper.  Quite frankly, I am frightened by the fact that so
many users gave this movie not only positive, but glowing
reviews.
The dialoge is just plain awful.  Not true to life, not believeable, and
most of all not funny.  Plot holes are everywhere.  The little introduction
freeze-frame tactic for newly emerging characters was pretty stupid. 
Everything just seemed so ill-timed.  Just . . . run away from this movie
unless you are the kind of pathetic a*@hole who pretends this is good
cinema.
