I can't help but think if this script was given to a director with
talent it could have ended up being a great movie. There are some
moments which could have been truly iconic, and the main characters are
well drawn.<br /><br />The casting is pretty horrible, with the exception of Willaim Defoe.
Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus do acceptable jobs of the
leads, but some of the other casting decisions are very suspect.<br /><br />The directing style derives obviously from John Woo and Quentin
Tarantino, and with some John Carpenter flourishes thrown in. Any of
the three directors mentioned could have done a hugely better film.<br /><br />I can't help but think that in 10 or 20 years time this movie will be
remade and like Oceans 11 will be much better for being remade.
