I know many people like this film and I respect that. We all have
different
tastes, to be sure. From my perspective, I can only say that I did not
care
about these two brothers or their perceived calling to free the world from
scum. They are pretentious and sanctimonious serial murderers who use
religion to justify their crimes. Add into this mix a ridiculous subplot
of
a gay cross-dressing FBI agent and, well, what more needs to be said?
Incidentally, I have not heard the &quot;F&quot; word used so much in a movie. I am
not a prude, but this was so repetitive as to be abusive to the audience.
If
you like non-stop swearing, murdering, slow motion slaughter, straining to
understand dialogue buried in Irish brogue, and attempts to rip off
Tarantino's style then go ahead and sit through this turkey. Otherwise, go
see Taxi Driver, Death Wish, or The Star Chamber or any other vigilante
movie. I can't imagine any other vigilante movie could be worse than this
one.
