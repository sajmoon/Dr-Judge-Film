&quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; tells of twin brother Irish-Catholics in Boston who
turn vigilante and begin offing bad guys all over town while FBI agent Dafoe
follows in their wake.  A B-flick with good production value, a mediocre
cast, a stupid story, and awful comedy, this flick has one man indie written
all over it. A sort of simple-minded &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; wanabee, &quot;The Boondock
Saints&quot; is just a whole bunch of uninspired gratuitous violence which should
play well in trailer parks all over the US. (C)
