Boondock Saints. Wow. No, I don't mean that in a good way. It was
shocking to sit through the hour I managed to watch. To think that
someone actually paid money to make this blows me away. At least I only
wasted the three bucks to rent it. The first thing that struck me about
it's silliness was the ham fisted way that we're shown the twin
brothers are very close. Every movement they make is in sync right down
to them taking off their shirts to go to sleep in their small bedroom.
Actually this comes off more as homo-eroticism than anything else. Just
when you think the film has settled down and can't get any more lame,
you're treated to something even more ridiculous. The brothers can
speak every language, they can survive leaps off of high buildings,
they can kill anyone and the police will applaud them. Since I don't
care enough about this steaming dog turd to write much more I'll just
say Willem Dafoe's character was completely unbelievable and it was a
shame one of the legit films Ron Jeremy appears in was this. I'll end
by saying, if you love films with Will Smith, Tom Cruise, you'll
probably love this. If you can't stand films that those guys make, stay
far away.
