I'm not from Southie, but I know it well enough to know neither is
Duffy. The movie is filled with ludicrous moments. I don't know which
is the worst travesty -- Billy Connolly or Willem Dafoe. The blaze of
bullets that never hit anyone or Dafoe's campy dancing. Your choice.
This movie appalling. It's a slander on Irish-America by a poser -- a
suburban upper-middle class kid trying to pass himself off as one from
the streets. I could not suspend my disbelief while watching this
movie. I think the only thing that made me watch it to the end was that
I kept thinking that it couldn't get any worse -- a thought that was
continually proved wrong.
