I watched THE BOONDOCK SAINTS upon the recommendation of a coworker who
told me he watches this movie at least ONCE A WEEK, this for past 4 or
5 years. I thought it must be seriously great or the coworker is
seriously crazy. Because I never even heard of this film, the
coworker&#39;s statement made me suspicious of its aforementioned
greatness.<br /><br />After watching it, well, it&#39;s obvious to me now that the coworker is
nuts, certainly if he watches this seriously derivative, over-directed
bland effort once a week.<br /><br />I cannot remember seeing a film that was so devoid of any character,
ideas, style, what-have-yas. The whole thing is sophomoric in the
extreme and not in a good fun way but in a retarded, arrested
development way. It&#39;s so bland and badly directed that I couldn&#39;t
differentiate the actors from the sets. Everything melded in one ugly
goo of awfulness.<br /><br />The only good thing about this disaster is the director won&#39;t be
directing any movies anymore because of his stupid ego and his big
mouth. The world has been spared!
