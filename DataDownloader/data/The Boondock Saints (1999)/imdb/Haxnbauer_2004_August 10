I am astonished that there are many positive reviews of this movie. I
am not the type of person who buys into conspiracy theories, but I have
to wonder if some of the reviews were planted by the director's family,
the friends and family of the actors, etc. To call this movie an
abortion is only slightly an exaggeration. I say &quot;slightly an
exaggeration&quot; only because I am a practicing Catholic and, well, you
know how we are on that subject. I'm sure lots of people would
categorize this film as an outright abortion.<br /><br />Here's all you need to know: 1) The acting sucks. It is so bad that you
have to think it's being done on purpose. Kind of like a Saturday Night
Live skit; 2) The script is a joke. The whole movie is so disjointed,
the dialog so inane, you have to figure the scriptwriters were severely
intoxicated fraternity boys; 3) The directing was, we'll here I go
again, an abortion.<br /><br />Save a nice piece of your life and don't waste even 5 minutes watching
this movie.
