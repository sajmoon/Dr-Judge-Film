Don&#39;t waste your time. While this movie could have potentially provided
great jokes, beautifully artistic scenes, and cinemagraphic innovation,
it falls into the category of failed Film School projects that
simplistic audiences are duped into liking. Ironically enough, the cast
is extremely strong and the script was absolutely wonderful. However,
the director&#39;s abuse of power ruins any merit providing a few
ridiculously melodramatic &quot;detective-recreation&quot; scenes by Willem DaFoe
coupled with a Clich&eacute;&#39;d depiction of our &quot;Hero&#39;s&quot; in Church and
surrounded by G-dlike figures.<br /><br />Overall, this movie doesn&#39;t deserve the cult following it has and
provides people an excuse to claim they support something artistic.
Unfortunately, bad taste and art go hand in hand.
