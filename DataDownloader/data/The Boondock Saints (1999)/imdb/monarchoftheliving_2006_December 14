I will try to be as concise in my review as possible. This movie is
bad. And not in a &#39;so bad it&#39;s funny&#39; sort of way, it is just plain bad
in the same way that Swordfish sucked. An absolute waste of time action
movie with pious pretenses of being a thought provoking play of
morality. This is the kind of trash that frat guys must think of as
cutting edge cinema.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the film is about two violent Irish brothers that decide
to kill people that they perceive as being &#39;evil&#39;. Right. Because
acting as a bloodthirsty vigilante and undermining the justice system
just because it doesn&#39;t meet your undefined standards of efficiency
gives you the moral high ground. Sure. It almost saddens me that so
many people on this site think that these two savages are somehow hip
or cool when in reality they are just thugs.<br /><br />The dialogue is lame. The acting is less than first rate, with the
notable exception of the always fine Willem Dafoe. The action scenes
are probably the only real thing this film has going for it, but even
they are rather clich&eacute;&#39;d shoot outs in a style so reminiscent of Woo
that you almost want to turn off the DVD in the middle of the film and
watch some Hong Kong cinema. The one saving grace of the film is the
realistic depiction of Bostonian Irish as uneducated lowlifes with a
propensity towards violence. Unflattering but dead on. Unfortunately,
the only distinction between the protagonists and antagonists of the
film is that some delude themselves into thinking theirs is the &quot;good&quot;
violence.<br /><br />If you want to see an ultra violent film that actually has some
substance to it, check out basically anything by John Woo, but
especially The Killer or A Better Tomorrow II, both of which have style
and substance.
