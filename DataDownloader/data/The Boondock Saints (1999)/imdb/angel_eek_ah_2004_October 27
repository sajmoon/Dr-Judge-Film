.. you are no Quentin, and I don't even like Tarantino. Just another
mindless violence-fest which tries to follow in the footsteps of
classics such as Trainspotting, and Way of the Gun. <br /><br />How do you fight evil? Well according to this movie, you become evil
yourself. I could not think of the brothers in any other light but
vile, evil creatures who murdered men who had families and lives that
they could have eventually sought retribution for. Whatever happened to
letting the police or FBI take care of it? Yet this movie TRIES very
hard in fact to make you believe these blood thirsty butchers gone
murderers are in the right. Not to mention their friend Rocco is a low
level gangster himself who likes to kill innocent animals. But that's
funny, right? Like tossing a hampster on the hood of a car in 110
degree weather.<br /><br />The comedy bits are clich&eacute;, as are the characters themselves. It seems
like every film like this these days has to have an unrealistically gay
character. (Much like &quot;The Mexican&quot;) Then to cumulate into the final
appearance by &quot;Il Duce&quot; (somebody shoot me) played by Connolly so
horribly that it makes you want to vomit, in the most unrealistic point
blank shoot out to ever grace movie screens. <br /><br />The prayers are vapid and utterly stupid. The accents are
unrecognizable as they seem to switch between Northern and Southern
Ireland at whim. The heroes are whiney little brats with bloody mouths.
The gun fights are utterly unrealistic, and attempting to be somewhere
along the lines of the poetry John Wu creates in his film, but fails. <br /><br />Then you have the title of the sequel. &quot;Boondock 2: All Saints Day&quot;.
Must have a special education kid working their promotional office. Can
you think of a more clich&eacute; sequel name, please?
