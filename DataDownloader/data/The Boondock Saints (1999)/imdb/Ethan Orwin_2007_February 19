Like Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is a great film. This
movie is to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs what &quot;Slumber Party
Massacre 2&quot; is to Psycho. It is a sad attempt to remake the whole &quot;cool
and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion
while saying cool and tough one-liners&quot; genre. Unfortunately, it lacks
all originality and the script is far from clever. Every character is
one-dimensional; the so-called organized criminals are just a bunch of
morons who get slaughtered in their hundreds by two meat packers from
Southie. Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat
accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin&#39;s unfortunate fate in
Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant
oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don&#39;t come close to stuff
Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school. By the way, the acting sucks.
Finally, the message that it&#39;s good for vigilantes to kill the
brainless ethnic stereotypes that pass for mafiosi in this movie (as
well as random guys at a strip club; I guess they&#39;re criminal scum as
well) whenever they feel like it will appeal to armchair suburbanites
scared of those big city lowlifes whom they&#39;ve heard about on the
news--it will seem ludicrous to anyone else. Skip this and throw on
&quot;Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver&quot;... or practically anything else you can
think of.
