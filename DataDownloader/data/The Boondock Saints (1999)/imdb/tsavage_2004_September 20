2004_September 20 

My son called me from Korea (Army Medic) to tell me that I had to see
this movie. He brought it home with him on leave and we watched it
together and he was absolutely right. It was &quot;off the chain&quot; as he
says. It was so different from the standard fare that only substitutes
different faces into the same tired story lines. We love it and I am
now buying my own copy. I recommend it to any one that I know is a
discriminating movie lover. I can't wait for the sequel. By the way ,
I'm a 43 year old mom of three so it's not just for 20 something males.
Willem Dafoe was over the top but absolutely perfect for this movie. My
husband hates movies and any TV that doesn't have a ball and a score,
but he actually loved this movie too. It kept him on the edge of his
seat and he actually laughed out loud several times.
