i may be extremely biased about this movie... its an underground cult
movie with pretty graphic violence irish protagonists and an idea to
debate... this is one of my favorite movies and resides in my short
list of crime movies to push on friends like the usual suspects and the
Italian job... our story follows our 2 instantly likable unassuming
irish catholic twin brothers... they following a run in with the
Russian crime syndicate in boston... decide to go vigilante and clean
the streets of crime by executing the criminals one at a time... its
often brought up in reviews that this movie probably would have
destroyed the box office had it not been overshadowed if not outright
shunned by the columbine high school massacre... however the film is
extremely well made very well written and iconic in its own right...
the macmanus brothers with silenced pistols in hand uttering the prayer
is now as much a cultural icon as tony montana or the rules of fight
club... the acting is as good as you can find... neither of the
brothers is actually from ireland i was very surprised to find out...
the always fantastic willem dafoe is on his game i really hope the
director troy duffey is feeling up to delivering us more adventures of
&#x22;the saints&#x22; one of those films you have to just see for yourself...
its an essential
