This movie was awful.  I rented it, expecting a decent gangster flick and
instead got this c**p.
It is a lame vigilante &quot;Punisher&quot; type flick with 2 super intelligent
orphaned Irish brothers in Boston who work in a slaughterhouse who decide
to
take down organized crime with their super-annoying, overacting bearded
friend.  Then there is Willem Dafoe, a gay FBI agent, who seems like a
rejected character from &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;  He is, of course, partnered with a
crusty local cop who doesn't like him, yet in the end comes to respect
him.
Awwww!  Gee, I've never seen that before in a bad cop movie!  His role is
to
flounce around and re-enact the boys' shooting sprees while swooning to
opera music.  It's worse than it sounds.  And of course, the local crime
families can't stop them so they get together to hire some out-of-town
heavy
hitter with no name &amp; a mysterious past.  Could his mysterious past
connect
with the orphaned brothers???  Gee, I wonder!  Could the boys be caught at
the end and the hard-working people of Boston rally around them?  Ugh.  It
tries to a clever and quirky, &quot;indie&quot; style flick and just seems like
clich`ed low-budget Hollywood c**p.
