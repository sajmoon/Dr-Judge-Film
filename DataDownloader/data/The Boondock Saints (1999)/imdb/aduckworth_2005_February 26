2005_February 26 
I first heard about this film while working at a multimedia department
store a few years back when a customer had asked if we carried it. It
wasn't in the store, and he said something along the lines of
&quot;*snicker*, probably because it was banned.&quot; I was never able to
confirm whether this film was actually banned or not, but I don't see
why it would be necessary to ban it (or ANY film that isn't snuff, for
that matter) when films that are arguably much much MUCH more violent
and much more blasphemous had been released before it. And I see
nothing about a ban being placed on it in the trivia or on the message
boards (unless I've missed something). So I'm venturing a guess to say
that this guy didn't know what he was talking about.<br /><br />Regardless, I came across a cheap copy of the DVD at a used store and
decided to check it out, because usually I'm interested in a lot of
films that have an aura of &quot;controversy&quot; or are rumored to have some
element of &quot;extremity&quot; in them, so I figured I might get some form of
enjoyment out of it. In the end, the only thing I really liked about it
was the fact that Willem Dafoe was in it (note that I didn't say I
necessarily enjoyed his *performance*, but rather just the fact that he
was IN it was somewhat amusing). Oh, and I laughed during one scene
when David Della Rocco's character was so completely flabbergasted by
all the death that surrounded him that he just kept stammering the
F-word over and over again, trying to form a sentence, but eventually
just gave up and jumped up in the air, dropping a big F-bomb -- in a
film with 246 occurrences of the F-word, that was the ONE moment where
I felt that the absurdity of the language really matched up with the
absurdity of the situation. Bravo.<br /><br />Otherwise, I was not very shocked or entertained by this film (though I
suppose I understand where its appeal lies). Generally what irks me
about a lot of modern action films is, to invent a term, their
&quot;cultural consciousness&quot; - that is to say, it is very conscious of its
own &quot;edgyness.&quot; While the Boondock Saints has an interesting gimmick
going for it - the idea of killing in the name of God - it winds up
being no more than just that: a gimmick. The rest of the story is just
a matter of keeping the audience entertained. Throw in some heavy
guitars and some big-beat electronica in the background of every action
sequence, saturate the dialog with obscenities, and have the characters
act like they're constantly on edge and have them do &quot;crazy&quot; things,
such as reciting prayers just before they blow someone's head off (oh,
and throw in a character with Turrets just for the hell of it). This
style seems directly catered to an audience that wants to see something
that's &quot;edgy,&quot; &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; but has little or no concept of
just how amazingly extreme and sophisticated things can get once you go
beyond Hollywood and the block-buster world (note: This is NOT a
Hollywood film, but it is not unlike something I would expect to see
come out of Hollywood {and props to the director for being able to
achieve this on a shoestring budget, but I have to wonder, if you're an
indie film maker who wants to make something &quot;extreme,&quot; why would you
look to Hollywood as a model for extreme film-making...?} Also, I do
not mean to imply that nothing in the mainstream is of any value,
because there are a LOT of major films that deserve their successes...
but rather more often than not the most valuable films tend to come
from people who are not trying to mass-market their art {and in
modeling his style after Hollywood film-making, it looks as though he
is trying to achieve this... and I imagine he'll get a bigger budget
for the sequel}).<br /><br />Ultimately, as I said before, this film comes across as being VERY
conscious of its own &quot;edgyness,&quot; and it is this quality that ruined
this film for me, as well as countless others. As for all the
comparisons to Tarantino - they simply are not justified. Sure,
Tarantino is fond of incorporating absurd violence and excessive foul
language into his films, but what drives his films is the way he sets
up his narratives and dialog sequences to generate implicit meanings
(rather than EXplicit) so that the violent scenes seem all the more
absurd, not to mention his style which is essentially taking references
to a zillion other films and combining them all and reshaping them to
create something that is entirely his own. So in essence, saying that
the Boondock Saints is &quot;like a Tarantino film&quot; is like saying Santa
Claus is &quot;like Jesus.&quot; <br /><br />To be honest, it's not a terrible film (there are MUCH lamer action
flicks out there, and much lamer things being produced by Hollywood in
general), and I'm certainly not going to be the asshole who says &quot;this
film is morally corrupt and therefore it is harmful to society,&quot; but I
was ultimately disappointed by it after being exposed to all the hype.<br /><br />-adam
