Like so many of you I was told about this film by some friends. They
were all so nutty about it and insisted that I watch it with them. So I
eventually had some free time and headed out to my friends house to
check it out.<br /><br />Big Mistake.<br /><br />Before the film even started they were telling me &quot;Man you're gonna
love it!&quot; and &quot;Dude this movie is soooooo badass!&quot; and &quot;Wait until you
see this one scene, its so damn cool!&quot; I'd to put part of the blame on
my friends over-hyping as to why the movie was terrible, but thats just
not the case. The acting was absolutely awful, the characters weren't
even close to developed, and the plot was so trite that it hurt to
watch. Even if I had been told that the film was absolutely terrible I
would have still been shocked. The only reason people think they like
the film is because of the violence, but I am 100% honest when I tell
you that the best violence in the world could not help this awful
movie.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you
hear from your friends about how great it is you need to do two things
1) punch your friend in the eye for supporting this garbage and 2) run
away and hide to avoid watching this terrible piece of crap.
