2002_November 1 

When this film first was released I had NO interest in seeing it, however
after hearing from four consecutive people how incredible and entertaining
this film was I changed my mind quickly and grabbed a copy to enjoy.  That
was my first mistake!<br /><br />I truly can't put into words how disappointed I was in this movie.  I went
into it expecting some fresh exciting crime film with good acting and
directing.  I was let down in all of these areas!  Especially in the acting
degree where, in my opinion, Dafoe gives his worst performance that I've
seen to date.  The story itself I thought was done very poorly as well.  I
mean the concept of the story, I still believe, is a good idea BUT this film
shows just how badly a good story can be ruined! but that's about as much
time and effort I'm going to give this waste of film...at least until Troy
Duffy apoloizes for putting me through his version of a
movie!<br /><br />
