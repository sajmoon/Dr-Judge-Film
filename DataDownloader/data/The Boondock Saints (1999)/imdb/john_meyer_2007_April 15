This movie defines the phrase &quot;no socially redeeming value.&quot; It is
vulgar and violent without a purpose. The killing is relentless and
endless, with frame after frame of gratuitous, slow motion violence,
some of it even repeated in case you didn&#39;t get enough of it the first
time.<br /><br />Violent movies can still make valid points and be worthwhile endeavors,
as Kubrick and others have shown. However, the difference between
Kubrick&#39;s violent movies and this one is the same as the difference
between the nude paintings hanging in the Louvre, and the photos in
Hustler magazine.<br /><br />Spend your time doing something else.
