I feel film deserves to be regarded as an art form on level with music and
literature. If this is the case, Boondock Saints is the Nelly and Harry
Potter of the film world in its intense popularity in the face of its
undeniable lack of any redemptive depth of intellectual
appeal.
Pretence is the name of the game as far as this stinker is concerned and
it
fails in several regards: Plot, acting/writing, and direction. Basically
everything that matters in a movie, this flick doesn't
have.
As far as the plot goes I have three big beefs (be forewarned, I will
probably disclose elements of the paltry plotlines in this
review):<br /><br />1) The two brothers are devout Catholics, but spend most of the movie
cursing and killing which are decidedly nonChristian activities. I hate to
nitpick, but the Christian element is such a big part of the story that
you
can't help but question the dubiousness of ending your prayers not with
`Amen' but with shooting someone's face off.
2) The entire moral element, which forms the basis of appeal for this
movie,
is compromised by the fact that the retribution is effected through
unrepentant mass murder. Practicing Christians like the characters in
Boondock Saints ought to remember that `vengeance is the Lord's' and
anyone
with a brain ought to realize that there's no moral lesson in
killing.
3) The whole storyline is a big can of creamed corn. From the pointlessly
gay detective joining forces with the vigilantes, to the mafia's secret
weapon (seeming pulled out of the Troy Duffy's butt halfway through the
script), to the fact that he's their father, to the ending courtroom
scene,
this is unmitigatedly corny.<br /><br />When it comes to the writing Troy Duffy and basically every actor needs to
learn the lesson that incessant screaming does not constitute dialogue.
This
seems perfectly obvious and yet it seems that when the boys aren't killing
something they're screaming their lungs out about something else. And when
neither of these is occurring, we are beholden to vapid attempts a witty
dialogue, the punch lines to which can be sited from miles
away.
As for the direction, Duffy could stand to learn much regarding what I've
already touched on, but I may as well mention the incessant awkwardness of
so much of this movie. There's the pointless confessional booth scene, the
cat scene (see `Pulp Fiction'), Willem Dafoe's dancing (and seduction of
men), basically everything is awkward and mindless in this
crapfest.<br /><br />Anyone, religious or not, ought to recognize the internal contradiction of
the entire premise this movie based on. To make matters worse it isn't
well
acted, well written, or even edited well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and temper your cinematic taste with the tried and
true:
Casablanca for the fantastic dialogue, Annie Hall for the humor, Citizen
Kane for the direction, Lawrence of Arabia for the visuals, The Sting for
the flawless delivery, the world of film has so much more to offer. Watch
any of these, then come back and see what you think about the latest
flavor
of the week movie.
