Ugh! Big acting is not good acting and organ music doesn't mean a scene is
well crafted.  This whole movie is blown completely out of proportion by the
makers, particularly the director.<br /><br />And Willem, please, go back to queen school because you carry off the  cross
dressing, gay FBI agent role as well as you would Tootsie.  Miss Doubtfire,
you ain't.<br /><br />How much bad acting/directing can you cram into one movie? Watch Boondock
Saints to find out.
