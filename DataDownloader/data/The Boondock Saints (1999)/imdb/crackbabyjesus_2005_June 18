Well, it's not the worst movie I have ever seen, that honor would go to
either 3000 miles from Graceland or Batman and Robin. I guess I don't
get the hype from fans that surrounds this movie. My buddy bought it
and had me come over claiming that it would be one of the best movies I
would ever see. Now, prefaced with that kind of statement I guess
anyone would be a little let down unless the movie was, say, a true
masterpiece. I felt the movie was forced and very pretentious in almost
every way. The dialog, the acting, the direction were all void of
originality or personality. I actually think that the story surrounding
the making of this movie with it's director's rapid rise and fall in
Hollywood is much more entertaining. That should be a full length
feature film. (I know, I know. There is a documentary already). I
generally like Willem Dafoe but he drove me nuts in this. I do not
recommend this movie at all, however judging by the other member's
reviews I am definitely in the minority.
