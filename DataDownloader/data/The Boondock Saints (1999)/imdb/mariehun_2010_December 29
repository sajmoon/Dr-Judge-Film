A good friend of mine recommended this movie. I may never speak to him
again.<br /><br />This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities and I love vigilante
movies. It didn&#x27;t know what it wanted to be, funny, ironic, serious,
poignant - it was none of these. It was insulting on so many levels.<br /><br />You need to be able to relate or empathize with a character in a film,
preferably one of the main characters. These were all horrible, e.g.
the brothers; and watching the Funny Man character was like sticking a
knife in your ear. After the shootout scene where The Funny Man gets
his finger shot off and Bill Connelly manages not to get hit with one
bullet, I couldn&#x27;t watch it anymore. I caught glimpses of the rest of
the film,Willem DeFoe cross-dressing, (you would think he could have
shaved his sideburns off), just horrible. So what went on after that
I&#x27;m not really sure of, but I am sure it was awful.
