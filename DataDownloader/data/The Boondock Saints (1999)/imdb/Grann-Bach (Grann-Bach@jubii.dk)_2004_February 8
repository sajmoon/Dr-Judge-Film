Very intelligent action movie, about two Irish brothers who kill
&#39;sinners&#39; to punish them. The movie is a bit different from the typical
action movie, as it doesn&#39;t have car-chases or explosions. The action
consists of stylish shooting sprees. It also has a fairly original idea
that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that
should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath,
the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc.
After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the
actual scene, of the brothers punishing criminals. It&#39;s a different
kind of vigilante movie. It&#39;s particularly gory and bloody, but this
just makes it all the more realistic. In real life, there is a
significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie
has some Christian subtexts, I think I&#39;ve heard about five major
theories about the whole movie&#39;s meaning. This shows, in my opinion,
that there was obviously a lot of thought put into the movie. I&#39;d
recommend it to anyone who can stand the gore, even if they aren&#39;t
Christians. 10/10
