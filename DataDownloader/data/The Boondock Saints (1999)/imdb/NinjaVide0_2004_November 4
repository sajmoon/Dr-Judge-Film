This movie is fairly decent but isn't as great as everyone hails it to
be. I have seen far better movies than this. &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;
comes to mind, or how about &quot;Godfather&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;,
&quot;Goodfellas.&quot; Willem Dafoe ruins the movie. He is one of the worst
actors ever. He ruined &quot;Platoon&quot; another good movie. If it wasn't for
Billy Connelly (Il Duce) this movie would be the worst movie I have
ever seen. I don't understand how it could get such a huge following
and a sequel. The movie stinks fair and simple. Go ahead and respond to
this comment but I don't care. You're foolish if you think this movie
deserves to be called an action movie or even a great movie. In
conclusion this movie, is god-awful and one of the worst pieces of
trash I have ever seen.
