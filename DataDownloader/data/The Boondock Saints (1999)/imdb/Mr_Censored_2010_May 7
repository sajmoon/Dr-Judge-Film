There&#x27;s a whopping back-story to &#x22;The Boondock Saints,&#x22; one which finds
its writer/director, Troy Duffy, becoming an outcast in Hollywood,
blowing his potential and alienating just about anyone and everyone who
cares about him. Knowing this can be a bit distracting when you watch
the film, as you can&#x27;t help but wonder how differently the film could
have turned out had it not been met with so much friction and abuse.
Case in point: when Miramax dropped the film in the late 90&#x27;s, Duffy
was forced to make the film with another studio with half of the
originally poposed budget. Ouch.<br /><br />Like any director worth his salt, though, Duffy pressed on and in the
face of his own self-imposed adversity, crafted a film that has been
widely regarded as a cult classic. Starring Sean Patrick Flanery and
Norman Reedus, &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; tells the wild tale of two Irish
brothers who, after a message from a higher power, go on a killing
spree, gunning down the criminals who pollute their home-town of
Boston. They are met with a mixed reaction of glee and outrage from
their fellow citizens as well as a flamboyant FBI special agent hot on
their trail, played by the great Willem Dafoe, who steals damn near
each and every scene he is in.<br /><br />While the film certainly has a few flaws (mostly dealing with bad
pacing issues) the end result is quite a visceral and cathartic
experience. The film has a unique take on vigilante justice (Duffy came
up with the idea for the film after witnessing a drug-dealer steal
money from a corpse) and much like the closing credits which depict the
various reactions the Saints are met with by the public, will likely
polarize its audience. There&#x27;s a wealth of ultra-violence and cool
shootout scenes are sprinkled throughout, but merely taking its surface
appeal away is to do the film a great injustice. In a way, &#x22;The
Boondock Saints&#x22; allows you to live vicariously through its characters,
who are only acting in a way that many of us have only dreamed about on
our worst day. In the end, it might not accomplish its lofty goals with
the greatest of ease, but at the very least, takes entertainment to a
whole new level.
