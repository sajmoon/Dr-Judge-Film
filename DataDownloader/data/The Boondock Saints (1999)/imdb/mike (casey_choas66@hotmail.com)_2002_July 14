What a huge mess. Not even William Dafoe can save this overly violent story
of two brothers who kill hardened criminals in the name of God. It's about
as bad as it sounds. first of all I don't know who taught these guys to do
action scenes and I don't know about anyone else but I don't like watching
endless shoot-outs in slow motion. Despite a few comical scenes most noted
is the very offbeat death of a cat this movie goes nowhere fast. This mind
numb film is filled with violence and endless stream of profanity and enough
gay jokes to last me a long time. Best leave this stinker right on the shelf
where it belongs.
