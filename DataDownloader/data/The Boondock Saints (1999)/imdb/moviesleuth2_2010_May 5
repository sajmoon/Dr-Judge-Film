If you were to cross Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino, you&#x27;d get
something like &#x22;The Boondock Saints.&#x22; True, the quality and skill are
nowhere near the level of Scorcese&#x27;s or Tarantino&#x27;s best films, but
that&#x27;s okay. &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; has no lofty goals. The only thing
that the film is trying to do is create a violent, bloody adrenaline
cocktail. And to that end, the film succeeds spectacularly.<br /><br />Boston, modern day. Criminals, mobsters and low-lifes are running amok.
Two brothers, Connor (Sean Patrick Flannery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus)
McManus are the brunt of the latest attack. But when they kill their
attackers in self-defense, they&#x27;re hailed as heroes. But after a number
of other criminals start dropping dead by the truckload, agent Paul
Smecker (Willem Dafoe) begins to realize the truth: the McManus
brothers are actually vigilantes.<br /><br />This movie is fun, in an extremely violent sort of way. The appeal of a
revenge flick is to experience the thrill of giving the bad guys their
just desserts. Stylistically, this is a triumph. The action scenes are
beautifully done, and the slow-motion increases the adrenaline. I
especially loved the effect where Smecker is inserted into the action
when he&#x27;s explaining how the latest kill went down.<br /><br />The acting is solid. Flannery and Reedus are very credible as brothers.
They have a good camaraderie, and they also have a penchant for playing
jokes on their friend, &#x22;Funny Man&#x22; Rocco (David Della Rocco). Rocco is
good as their mob flunky friend who joins them. Willem Dafoe is clearly
enjoying himself in an off-the-wall performance as the gay Smecker, and
he&#x27;s always fun to watch. The real surprise is Billy Connolly, however.
Connolly is known as an adept comedian, but he&#x27;s actually creepy as the
notorious mob killer, Il Duce.<br /><br />&#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; had a troubled production history, and most of
that had to do with writer/director Troy Duffy. Miramax loved the
script so much that they assigned Duffy to direct it, and they signed a
record deal with Duffy&#x27;s band. But Duffy&#x27;s ego got in the way, and
production halted. By the time filming got underway, the budget was cut
in half, and the release was heavily restricted due to the Columbine
tragedy. However, based on word of mouth, the film became a cult
classic.<br /><br />Whatever faults Duffy may have personally, the film looks great, and is
a lot of fun to watch. Influences from Tarantino (non-linear
storytelling) and Scorcese (Boston setting, Catholicism) are evident,
but this film appeals more to our basic instincts than our minds.<br /><br />Call it the ultimate guilty pleasure if you must, but I have no guilt
about loving this movie.<br /><br />My rating: Rated R for Strong Bloody Violence and Pervasive Language
