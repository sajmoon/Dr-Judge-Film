2005_January 6 
First and foremost this film is morally repugnant, especially for it's
interpretation of what is religiously moral and it's fake &quot;street
interviews&quot; at the end. A calculated but ham fisted way to pretend that
this film speaks for common folk.<br /><br />But getting beneath that, this film is a train wreck.<br /><br />Terrible cartoonish characterizations. Overblown acting. Gaping plot
holes. Troy Duffy desperately wants to be Quentin Tarantino, but he is
frankly not clever enough. The film looks alright, and the editing is
almost as good as you would expect from a first film, but largely it's
a gimmick film and a derivative one at that.<br /><br />Duffy clearly has an agenda (and a pretty crappy worldview.) I think he
would be well served to learn more about the world before he creates
propaganda on how to fix it.<br /><br />Lord help us that he is making a sequel.
