I dont understand why people think this movie is so good. Is it because
they
do cool things when they kill someone or because of the bad ass prayer
that
they say. Come on. This movie is not that great. Willem Dafoe is the only
good actor in it and even he doesnt do a great job. this is an overated
movie.
