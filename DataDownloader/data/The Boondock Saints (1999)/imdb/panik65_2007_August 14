Capsule review: Think Dirty Harry or Death Wish as vomited up on the
screen by formerly molested altar boy who has just seen Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />It&#39;s an &quot;angry white dude&quot; vigilante movie for the oi/fascist/skinhead
crowd, since Dirty Harry just isn&#39;t cool anymore, Clint Eastwood&#39;s too
old, Charles Bronson doesn&#39;t have enough tattoos, and well, Rambo&#39;s too
establishment. <br /><br />I was not bothered by the &quot;ridiculousness&quot; of the movie, nor the poor
production quality. It&#39;s just stupid and offensive, that&#39;s all. How do
you make catholicism hip? I know! have them kill people while reciting
their prayers in Latin! Yeah, that&#39;s it! Catholicism&#39;s now part of the
hip, sadistic, Tarantino-fueled counterculture!<br /><br />On some level the movie is at times enjoyable, but it&#39;s so stupid and
reactionary. Psychopathic reactionaries like Troy Duffy seem to have
hit the &quot;hip jackpot&quot; of blood, guns, snuff &amp; torture scenes, heavily
choreographed &quot;slow mo&quot; shootouts and fake, &quot;snappy&quot; dialog replete
with obscure pop culture references ... it really seems to have a never
ending appeal with the troglodyte population of the USA.<br /><br />Sorry, there&#39;s just no way to make Christianity &quot;hip,&quot; not all the
snuff gore in the world will do that.<br /><br />(it&#39;s already been tried)
