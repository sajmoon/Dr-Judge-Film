This is simply the best bad film ever. i show it to my friends and they
all wet themselves laughing at it. It is one of the stupidest, most
derivative, badly acted, badly written and badly directed films ever.
And therein lies its brilliance. It simply has to be seen. And being
Irish myself, the accents are a joy to behold. particularly Norman
Reedus' speech in the courtroom, where he goes from bad Irish, to
welsh, to Pakistani, to Australian, and best of all, ends with Jamaican
Rastafarian. one of the worst films ever made, go see it. It really
does give plan 9 from outer space a run for it's money. PS. Having read
some of the other comments by people who have both taken this film
seriously, and enjoyed it, I'm very afraid for the future of the human
race
