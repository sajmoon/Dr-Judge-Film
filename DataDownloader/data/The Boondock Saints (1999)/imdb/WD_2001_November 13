What a waste of time. Everything in this movie has been done before and it
has been done a lot better by others. I read comments that compared it
with
Tarantino, Kubrick,... and most of them said this movie was better.
Someone
even called it better than Pulp Fiction, but it sucked. The dialoge was
crap, the acting wasn't very good, this &quot;Rocco&quot; was the most annoying
caracter I ever saw in a movie, the story and the gay cop were so
clich&eacute;,...<br /><br />The only reason I laughed a few times was because it was so
bad.
I'm happy I didn't have to pay to see this crap.
