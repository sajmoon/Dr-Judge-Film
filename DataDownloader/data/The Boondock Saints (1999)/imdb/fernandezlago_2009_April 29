Take an erratic attempt at doing Guy Ritchie plus an erratic attempt at
doing Scorsese and what you get is The Boondock Saints.<br /><br />What starts as an stylized, fast-paced mob flick, ends up being no more
than an infantile MTV-style exercise in fandom. Granted, the influences
are good (the aforementioned Guy Ritchie and Scorsese), but too
obvious, and the film brings nothing new to the table. It only comes to
show that when you&#x27;re dealing with a time-honored genre like this, you
better be able to hold your own. And the makers of this film don&#x27;t. <br /><br />While the first 45 minutes still seem to deserve the benefit of the
doubt, and there are some nice things about the film (Willem Dafoe&#x27;s
flamboyant character, specially), it is clear after the confessional
booth scene that the plot is going nowhere. By the time of
cross-dressing by Dafoe, I decided I&#x27;d had enough.<br /><br />Sorry kid, nice try. But no. Live, and learn, and develop your style.
And for Chrissakes, get a good script.
