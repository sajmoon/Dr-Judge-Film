One of the WORST films I have ever had the dubious pleasure of watching all
the way through to the end.  The action is so bad it's comedic, the
characters are poorly crafted and underdeveloped, the soundtrack is one of
the worst ever set to film, and the lame attempts at humor irritate far more
than they amuse.  The dialog as well as the story itself is not even B movie
quality.  Avoid at all costs.
