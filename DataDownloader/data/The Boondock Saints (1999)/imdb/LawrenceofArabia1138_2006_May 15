What makes me sickest is that this movie is being compares to the work
of Tarantino and other great directors. The thing that makes me second
sickest is that it is being praised by so many people. The dialogue is
horribly written. The acting is poor. The accents are phony. The action
is dull and nothing we haven&#39;t seen before. The characters have no
depth. The humor sucks. It is filled with pointless scenes. The
cinematography is unoriginal. It should have been more violent. The
movie takes it&#39;s main ideas from movies like Taxi Driver,etc. It is
filled with poor stereotypes. And the direction is the worst. Get Troy
Duffy out of the the film business please! There are very few good
parts in this movie. One is in the beginning when they are in the
chapel, two when the cat is shot, and three when Willem Defoe&#39;s
character is in the confession booth. And I&#39;d have to say all the other
scenes are very poor and quite stupid. Especially the final scene of
the movie when people are being interviewed. People who like this
movies need to start watching some good movies.
