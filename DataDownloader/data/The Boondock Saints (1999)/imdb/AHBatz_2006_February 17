I watched this movie a few weeks ago and boy was it terrible.<br /><br />First off the two main characters are pretty hard to relate to. They
are extremely religious, Irish, fraternal twins. Religious to the point
of tattoos in Latin. And of course, they are vigilantes. With all the
evil in the world they chose to take down the mafia. And being
vigilantes they decide that the best way to do this is to kill them
all.<br /><br />Another character is the expert crime scene investigator played by
William Defoe. He is incredibly smart and seemingly perfect at his job.
The real problem with him is that near the end of the movie he turns to
the side of the Irish brothers. &quot;Why,&quot; I asked myself &quot;,would he turn
to the side of the religious Irish vigilantes?&quot; Because his messed up
priest told him to! Another thing I found disturbingly wrong with this
movie, is how the brothers preform a weird ritual that involves pennies
and a prayer for every criminal they murder. As if they really care
about the people that much! They also seem to be trying to prove a
point that killing bad people is good when linked to religion. The
movie tells us the lie that two wrongs make a right.<br /><br />Don't see this movie unless you like to rant or you don't care about
the mental message the movie tries to show.<br /><br />Thank you!
