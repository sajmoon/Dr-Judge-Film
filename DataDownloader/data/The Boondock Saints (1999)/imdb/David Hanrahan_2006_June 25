I stopped watching it about halfway through it. Bad Bad Bad acting.This
movie was a B movie all the way. I never really stop watching a movie
during it. Mixing religion and killing and then contradicting
themselves. There was a few good parts but I rate it a 5 only because
of the few good parts or it was a 4.William Defoe is a great actor and
carried this film. The brothers were also OK. But the Pornstar and the
fake Italian&#39;s accent were so bad it was ruined. I have read in places
this is an underground classic.My friend John bought this yesterday and
said he loved it. It is a little different and that may seem appealing
to some but lacking quality acting.
