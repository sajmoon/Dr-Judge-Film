I had read the novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs on John Carter
several years ago, when I was in high school.&#x27;A Princess of Mars&#x27; was
great fun, full of action, adventure, romance and elements of sci-fi.
So I was really looking forward to see this movie. In recent years,
advances in IT/special effects have made it possible to bring to life
almost any character, any kind of story.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in one aspect : the movie faithfully recreates
the sense of &#x27;barbaric splendor-but in decay&#x27;. The &#x27;Tharks&#x27; also come
to life exactly as you would imagine. &#x27;Woola&#x27; is a delight. Even the
white apes look terrific. In Burroughs novels, we can be sure there&#x27;s a
lot more of fiction than science in &#x27;science-fiction&#x27;. The movie is
pretty much the same. This is not in itself a problem, because most of
the hugely successful franchises in recent years are pure fantasy :
Lord of Rings, Harry Potter etc. The ending is very different to the
novel and some new elements and characters are there which are puzzling
and not fully explained. The acting is pretty poor; again, Burroughs&#x27;
characters are not particularly known for being highly emotive or
articulate.<br /><br />One thing is certain : there&#x27;s going to be a sequel. I urge the
producers to use that opportunity to build in all the elements that
were missing in the first movie : (1) a little more science to make
&#x27;suspension of disbelief&#x27; easier (2) a little emotion, drama and
character in the main roles (3) as the main story line has already been
tinkered with, pls go a little further and make it really good.(4) DO
NOT CHANGE the settings, costumes, flying machines etc. in short, all
the props are just fine.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for some light hearted fun, a &#x27;Mars version&#x27; of
good old Westerns, this movie fits the bill just fine. Don&#x27;t expect
more and you will not be disappointed.
