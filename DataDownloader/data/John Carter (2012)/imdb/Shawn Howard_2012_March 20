I went to the local IMAX to see John Carter this week end and I really
enjoyed it, as did my friends 13 year old. We also took in the Iron
Lady and The Artist and enjoyed it more than both of them put together.
I know a flop when I see one and it&#x27;s a shame that John Carter is
tanking at the box office. Believe me it&#x27;s not the best film I have
seen but it did keep my attention and the characters were interesting
enough to care about. What more do people want out of a film these days
is beyond me, but then again we are talking about some people who have
the attention span of a gnat brought on by the convenience of being
able to &#x22;click&#x22; to the next available piece of entertainment at any
sign of boredom. We had at least seven people walk out of The Artist
within the first 15 minuets because they couldn&#x27;t take that it was
silent, and it won Best Picture. Granted John Carter has a few slow
parts but none that made me want to get up and visit the concession
stand. Such a shame too because I would like to see the story continue
where it left off. This will be one to put into my Blu-ray collection
when available and that&#x27;s saying something. If this is something you
wanted to go see then do it and make up your own mind, you will
probably enjoy yourself as much as I did.
