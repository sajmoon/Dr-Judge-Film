Don&#x27;t be swayed by what others are saying negatively about this film
...just go see it with a totally open mind and have some fun...
...isn&#x27;t that what going to the movies is for... ...to be entertained
...to leave the real world behind ....to suspend disbelief ...to me
this was every bit as cutting edge as when Star Wars first appeared on
the scene back in the &#x27;70&#x27;s. Give it a go... I&#x27;m glad I did... I was
thoroughly taken in by this film; and surely you will be as well.
Thanks to a sure-handed director, an inspired cast, and state of the
art technical people, it&#x27;s a fulfilling experience that I predict will
remain with you always -- especially if you are among the young! JOHN
CARTER is the ultimate exotic adventure; a masterpiece of cinematic
action and pacing.
