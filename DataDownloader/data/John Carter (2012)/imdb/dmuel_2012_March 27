John Carter is a romantic fantasy about a US Civil War vet who is
mysteriously transported to Mars. There he meets an array of odd
creatures, villains, humanoids with unworldly powers, and a hot babe.
Some viewers have compared it to Star Wars and I can see what they
mean, although this is based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs series that was
written about 100 years ago. <br /><br />This movie has bombed. Disney is reported to have lost $200 mil on it,
and I think there are three reasons for this. 1) Unfortunately, it&#x27;s
easy to think of Star Wars when viewing this movie; both are romantic
adventures set on another planet, so the movie is about 30 years too
late. 2)Taylor Kitsch was a horrible choice for the lead role. His
performance falls flat as a pancake as the hero/protagonist; he&#x27;s
utterly unconvincing. And 3), this one is my personal reason: the movie
has really bad music. And it never stops; from beginning to end, we
only get about 10 minutes respite, (in nearly 3 hours of film), from
this constant humming of violins, tooting of horns, and droning human
voices ala the chorus from Holst&#x27;s Neptune. It nearly drove me nuts.
