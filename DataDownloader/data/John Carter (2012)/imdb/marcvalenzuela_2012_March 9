Hearing about this Disney film&#x27;s story sparked my interest in seeing
this right away! I finally did and overall, the characters, the
setting, and the plot flowed seamlessly well together! It&#x27;s like
Disney&#x27;s formula of &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; and &#x22;Avatar&#x22; meets &#x22;Prince of Persia:
Sands of Time.&#x22; <br /><br />So, the plot revolves around a Civil War veteran who is somehow
transported to Barsoom (aka Mars), where he must help a princess and a
colony succeed in a heated battle against another feuding colony.<br /><br />Director Andrew Stanton delivered well in this epic take of John
Carter. Sure, star Taylor Kitsch seems like he&#x27;s trying a little too
hard as the lead guy, but it looks like he&#x27;s heading toward the same
path left behind by Jake Gyllenhaal for &#x22;Prince of Persia&#x22;: serious
character figure, yet sometimes able to show unintentional humor
usually without noticing. Though not bad on either one&#x27;s part! <br /><br />Since John Carter was conceived as a story back in 1912 by Edgar Rice
Burroughs (of Tarzan fame), I have to say that this movie is certainly
NOT a rip-off. A film like this deserves more credit than initially
given! Epic action/adventure films like &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; and &#x22;Avatar&#x22;
wouldn&#x27;t exist today without these early roots! It pretty much sparked
an influence on the sci-fi, action, adventure genre films that most
audiences came to know decades later.<br /><br />It looks like Stanton&#x27;s following exactly what his fellow Pixar
colleague Brad Bird had done with Tom Cruise in &#x22;Mission Impossible:
Ghost Protocol,&#x22; stepping up as director for once in live-action! Not
bad for their first time.
