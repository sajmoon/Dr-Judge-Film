Did anyone read the book??? Obviously the film-makers only read the
outline of the Cliff Notes version. Disney &#x26; Stanton had a chance at a
potential real gem and blew it. They ripped the guts out of the story.
I am getting to really hate movies that are &#x22;based upon&#x22; or &#x22;inspired
by&#x22; a great piece of literature. If you can come up with a better story
and presentation - great - I am all for it. But this movie seemed like
an assigned project in college that just had to get done even if done
badly.<br /><br />Even all of the reviewers I read did not comment on the differences
with the book. Many of the negative reviews did comment on the lack of
dialogue and the poor acting. Also the romance between the main
characters was not believable precisely because the great dialogue and
interplay was left out.<br /><br />To all of those reviewers who are looking for the dialogue, the
character building, and even the action - I say, go read the book. It
is all there. That is why this movie angers me. The film-makers had
great source material but did not use it. This is a sad commentary on
the film-makers of today.
