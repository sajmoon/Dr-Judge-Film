... have to say, going into this one I did feel like i was rolling the
dice a bit. The marketing campaign hasn&#x27;t exactly been stellar for the
film.. It seems like Disney didn&#x27;t know how to market it.<br /><br />Too bad it seems to be paying the price at the box-office, because my
instincts were right in checking this one out. I was hoping for
something reminiscent of some of the Disney &#x22;duds&#x22; of my youth, like
TRON and the BLACK HOLE, and it&#x27;s exactly what i got.<br /><br />This one is actually a pretty good film, and one that i would imagine
my young son will look upon, in a couple of years, the same way i
looked on the aforementioned flicks of the late 70&#x27;s/early 80&#x27;s.<br /><br />It&#x27;s too bad it&#x27;s released in these trying financial times, i think
that may be a big contributor as to why this film isn&#x27;t doing better.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a pretty good sci-fi epic that, i hope, will some day find it&#x27;s
audience...<br /><br />Oh, and i&#x27;d be remiss if i didn&#x27;t mention that the pre-teenage boy in
me didn&#x27;t find Lynn Collins to be smoking hot.
