John Carter is one of the best when it comes to visual beauty. The Mars
or so called Barsoom is beautifully filmed, the 3D effects are good
with CGI battle sequences and the goodness just ends here. The film
features the protagonist John Carter who lands on mars out of nowhere
and for some reason falls in love with the princess of Helium and teams
up with her to protect Helium from a threat which is not clearly
defined. John Carter lacks the flair of a superhero and the acting of
others are at mediocre levels. Bad script, clunky dialogs, absolutely
no humor and lack of detailing of the plot doesn&#x27;t allow the audience
to get connected to the film. The movie moves too fast yet it seems too
lengthy. All the superhero movie that has succeeded in past is just
because of the connection it made to the audience, we love superman,
spider man, Batman(Joker)etc, But you will simply not love John Carter.
Disney please learn from your mistakes I hated TRON legacy and now I
didn&#x27;t like John Carter. 8 out of 10 for visual effects 2 out of 10 for
story telling
