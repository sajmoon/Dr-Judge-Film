John Carter of Mars was a book which I loved when I was a kid. Watching
the same adaptation come to life in a live action flick with amazing fx
from the people at Disney, was priceless! Book lovers will not be let
down as the movie has kept the essence and it&#x27;s a trilogy. So, rest
assured, every character is going to develop further and we&#x27;re gonna be
awed more and more. All those reviewers who are looking for a movie
that is slow, full of drama, emotions overflowing from all the
characters, long and slow camera panning, midnight in Paris or the
descendants, just go and watch just that same. This movie is meant for
the other 98% of the world who enjoy movie with good action, adventure
and magical moments. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but I don&#x27;t go by the
Academy&#x27;s standards. Their standards are useless if The Dark Knight and
Inception and Cloverfield and many movies like them were overlooked.
And how about &#x27;The Beaver&#x27;? Anyway, in conclusion, John Carter is a
must watch and in a good theater. Watch it in 3D, its spectacular.
You&#x27;ll love it. I rate it a point or two higher because it deserves
more.
