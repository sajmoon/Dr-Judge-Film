Yes, it looks like an answer to James Cameron&#x27;s tale of bold blue
people - but it&#x27;s not. This story is much older and... better. From my
experience I&#x27;d like to say that is a modern version of &#x22;Flash Gordon&#x22; -
bright, somewhat even ridiculous, but at the same time atmospheric and
sometimes astonishingly epic. There&#x27;s some minor problems with the
script (setting is so vast that several details could easily have been
lost), and the cast is also not as good as it should be. But the story
works and works great - mainly because of amazing Barsoom world, filled
with different creatures, mechanisms and characters. There&#x27;s a lot of
great visual elements (fighting scenes, flying ships, The Tarks) that
make this Martian world believable and somewhat beautiful.
