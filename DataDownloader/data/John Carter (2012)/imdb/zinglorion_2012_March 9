So I just saw the film. Pretty solid CG and FX, I did enjoy the on
screen magic thoroughly. For those who don&#x27;t know this movie was based
on a scifi novel waaaayyy, ahead of its time by E.R. Burroughs. I think
for the money Disney has spent on marketing and hype this movie will
end up merely being a flash in the pan. The movie follows John Carter a
former confederate soldier out trying to find gold in Arizona.
Different than the book as he&#x27;s apparently a miserable widower getting
run down by the authorities constantly. Finds cave. Mysteriously
transported to &#x22;Barsoom&#x22;(Mars) Meets the 4 armed Tharks. Yadda yadda.
Entertaining flic, I gave it a 6. Far from the epics of Star Wars and
Avatar which followed E. Burroughs formula. The movie moved along too
rapidly to connect emotionally to the characters and even with the
world and its stark differences from earth. Truthfully a bit
disappointed in this screen adaptation of such a classic, however, it
does beat the hell out of &#x22;Princess of Mars&#x22; which was based on the
novels also. Anyway, catch on DVD when it comes out. Doesn&#x27;t live up to
the novels or hype.
