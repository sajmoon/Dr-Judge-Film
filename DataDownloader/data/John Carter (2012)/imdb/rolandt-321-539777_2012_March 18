Just got back from the 3:10 show of John Carter in Glendale AZ. About
45 in the theater. Folks enjoyed it, laughing in the right places and
so forth.<br /><br />My first view was eight days ago in 2D, and this was 3D. Personally, it
was measurably clearer to me, visually. Carter and Tars, for instance,
didn&#x27;t get lost in the crowded scenes. Also, the long shots of
landscapes? By Jove! There were Thoats and riders &#x27;way down there,
moving through the scenery!! Even the more closely-framed scenes worked
better for me in 3D.<br /><br />This was my first modern-era 3D movie experience, and I was expecting
to be rather disappointed, based on what I had read on an ERB list. But
it worked so much BETTER for me than 2D! Who woulda thunk it? Anyway,
also, overall, I &#x22;got&#x22; more in general the second time too, as there is
a lot going on both on- and off-camera. Enjoyed both script-wise and
acting-wise. It is not the exact book, but I think it&#x27;s pretty
wonderful, frankly. Carpers may carp, but IMHO this is far beyond what
any ERB fan could have expected in the real world - and I mean that in
a good way.<br /><br />Sequel coming or not, it&#x27;s a winner of a flick.<br /><br />So there.
