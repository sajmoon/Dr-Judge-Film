Caught the first show here in bangalore. First of all, hats off to the
director for pulling off something this big in Hollywood cinema. I
agree SyFy movies follow certain convention. They cannot be compared to
big nationwide blockbusters with spectacular special effects and
equally big budgets, like, say, James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar. Movies can be
all characterized by really good stories, usually based on accomplished
sci-fi novels, but at the expense of modest and limited special
effects. Because I grew on books and I prefer a movie with IMax Real
3D, even sacrificing the technical level, than completely mindless and
empty blockbusters offering ONLY 2 Dimensional effects.<br /><br />Believe me, I am ashamed to even commit to my friends that I saw this
crap. John Carter is silly from the beginning and never delivers
anything intelligent, which is expected from a science fiction. I feel
sorry for Stanton who has compromised so much, just to please his fan
base. It is difficult to believe that he is the same person who helmed
such potboilers as Nemo&#x27;s Choice, The Incredible Lorax, and Finding
Nemo.<br /><br />So this movie is just like that - poor effects when compared to
Transformers and other nationwide hits, but an interesting story based
loosely on ERB&#x27;s classic. Nice dose of action, some history, some
cultural clash between different historical periods, green people
unstead of blue, everything makes logical sense, decently acted. Maybe
not Oscar-worthy, but still very watchable.<br /><br />I am really a big fan of SyFy and its convention. I only wish they
would become a paid channel so that they can escape the usual network
censorship and other limitations. Still staying focused on stories
rather than effects, but more open to the after-hours market. Something
like HBO.<br /><br />All together 2 THUMBS UP Stanton. This movie is going to make wonders
for Hollywood Cinema.... keep &#x27;em coming, but avoid the Sci-Fi mistake
next time, &#x27;kay?
