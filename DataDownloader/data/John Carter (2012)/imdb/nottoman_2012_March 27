Clean, action-packed, great characters and aliens, brave heroes and
beautiful heroines. It&#x27;s hard to believe the book it&#x27;s based on,
Princess of Mars was written in 1913. Everyone from James Cameron of
&#x22;Avatar&#x22; fame, Ray Bradbury, and Carl Sagan, have all attributed much
of their inspiration to this landmark book that was Edgar Rice Burrows&#x27;
first book, even before he wrote Tarzan. Pretty awesome for a guy who
was in the pencil sharpener business. Safe for kids. I feel like I&#x27;m a
serious movie watcher, and I really enjoyed this - I have to confess, I
read the whole John Carter of Mars series as a teen, and totally loved
them - I&#x27;m a 47 year old business owner with a large family, and I&#x27;d
see it again in an instant. Great romance element, and some
unforgettable alien characters - kind of like how r2d2 is a part of
Star Wars, there&#x27;s some great characters that are part of this movie
that aren&#x27;t &#x22;main characters&#x22;.
