2012_March 20 
The lukewarm reviews of the movie I&#x27;ve read here and there are
inexplicable to me - I find it hard to imagine a better translation of
the source material to the big screen. I truly feel that to dislike
this film, you must dislike the genre as such. The movie is fun, it&#x27;s
grand, it&#x27;s well casted, well directed and visually amazing.<br /><br />Given that the movie has - almost officially - been declared a flop, we
probably will not get a second installment in what could have become a
great franchise. Fortunately, the movie is self contained (though still
with all kinds of possibilities open), and does not as such need a
follow up. So if we only get this one, at least we get a good sense of
closure for the characters.<br /><br />With better marketing and perhaps some more reviewers not afraid to
speak up for adventurous escapism, this movie - in my view - could very
well have become the Star Wars for a new generation. <br /><br />I for one am going to see it again (and buy it on Blu-ray).
