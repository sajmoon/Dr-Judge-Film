The budget and box office of this film are drawing more attention than
the movie itself and I can see why. It is indeed an attempt at
spectacle and creating something epic but that&#x27;s all it ends up
being... an admirable effort. There&#x27;s nothing extraordinary about any
of it. The story, special effects and the action sequences struck me as
being very ordinary. There&#x27;s very little depth to any of it and yet
many scenes felt bloated and overlong. There&#x27;s also the aspect that
plot points and character motivation were explained and justified quite
poorly. Still, I was interested in this sci-fi ride and was enchanted
by the lovely Lynn Collins. Her performance and her character are truly
bright spots in this rather ordinary adventure.
