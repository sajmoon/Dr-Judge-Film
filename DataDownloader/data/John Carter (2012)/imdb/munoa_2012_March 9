Just got back from the midnight showing. Saw it. Loved it. Even better
second time! (Saw a 3D sneak preview.)<br /><br />Dafoe was a gem as Tars Tarkas. Lynn Collins was stunning as Deja
Thoris. Kitsch had all the right stuff to be John Carter. CGI was
seamless. Interesting editing. <br /><br />An amazing world! Fun, fun pulp fiction, just as the story was meant to
be. Pure ERB escapism. Can&#x27;t wait for Gods of Mars!.<br /><br />Kids will love it! A fun film for the whole family!<br /><br />Do see it in 2D. Did not like the 3D. Dark and blurry. Very
distracting. Much better as a traditionally projected film
