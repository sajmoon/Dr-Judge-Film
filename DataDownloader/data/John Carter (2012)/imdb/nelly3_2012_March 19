2012_March 19 
I went to the film expecting to be disappointed. I knew nothing about
the Burroughs story (except that the Frazetta artwork was much
appreciated as an adolescent male), and the film trailers gave me the
impression that it would be a couple of hours of glitzy special effects
but with little substance to the story. Fortunately, a boring Sunday
was motivation enough to go and end up being quite pleased by a story
that was exciting, engaging and even at times endearing. For the first
time in a good while, I left the theater wanting more (and the story
line certainly leaves itself open for a sequel). The film has a good
look and feel (somewhere I read where a reviewer aptly described it as
steam-punk meets Star Wars), and the performances had me believing in
the plight of the characters. That it won me over in spite of my
initial skepticism and that it made me crave more pushed my rating to a
9. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not high art. But at least, in my
opinion, this met its mark better than other similar films such as
Avatar. (I never quite forgave the Avatar hero for abandoning his first
flying reptile).
