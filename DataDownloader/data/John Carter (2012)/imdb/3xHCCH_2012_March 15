By this time &#x22;John Carter&#x22; had already received so much bad press, with
people already calling it a massive flop at the box office. I went to
watch this with the whole family yesterday despite all that. At least I
am not expecting too much out of this movie already.<br /><br />&#x22;John Carter&#x22; is based on a 100-year novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs
called &#x22;Princess of Mars.&#x22; &#x22;Tarzan&#x22; aside, I did not know that Mr.
Burroughs had any other books, sci-fi at that, so ahead of his time, so
I was interested. Here, a Civil War captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch)
was transported by a mysterious blue medallion to a foreign planet
inhabited by tall lizard-like beings with four arms, where he could
&#x22;leap tall buildings in a single bound&#x22;. This planet turns out to be
Mars, and he gets involved in its political turmoil as he rescues
Dejah, the plucky and scientific-genius princess of the Helium tribe.<br /><br />The set-up for me took a little bit too long, and I felt the whole
movie go by so very slowly. So I felt that was a really stuffy
screenplay by Director Andrew Stanton (who also wrote and directed a
number of Pixar classics like &#x22;Nemo&#x22; and &#x22;Wall-E&#x22;). However, the
visuals and the action were all excellently executed. You can see where
the $200+M production went. The sets, props, costumes and CGI were
top-notch. So my final verdict is that &#x22;John Carter&#x22; is not really a
bad film. It was very good when it is good. It is just unfortunate that
the good parts would have to come after the first hour.
