I was a little skeptical about another Hollywood adaptation of a
classic book, but this movie proved my wrong. It makes Avatar look like
an Ed Wood movie! There is a perfect mix of visual wonder, great action
scenes, very good acting, and a little infusion of humour in the right
places. This is one of those movies that you can sit through several
times and still feel awe at the action on the screen. What a delight to
watch a movie with no dead spots to suffer through or heavy handed
political messages (Avatar). This could be one of the top ten movies of
the year despite a bit of a lukewarm reception by the &#x22;critics&#x22;. Call
the babysitter and go have yourself a wonderful experience!
