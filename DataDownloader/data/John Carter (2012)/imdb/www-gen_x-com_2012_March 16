When I first saw the previews for John Carter I didn&#x27;t have high hopes
for it. In fact my viewing of the moving was entirely due to
circumstances of convenience and boredom. What I actually found when I
sat in the dark cinema to view this movie was actually a small bit of
movie gold. The film exceeded all expectations and kept me entertained
from beginning till end. The movie was filled with everything
necessary; a believable hero (of course as believable as a movie about
mars can be), wonderfully filmed cinematics, steady and pleasant
character development, comedy in seemingly all the right places, and
the proper mix of action that kept it from getting getting to stale. <br /><br />Don&#x27;t listen to the critics, go out and see the movie for yourself and
be your own judge, but I believe this movie is one that everyone can
easily fall in love with if their fans of this genre. I wasn&#x27;t a
believer in John Carter before; however, I&#x27;m happy the movie proved me
wrong.
