This is a film that bears watching more than once, and is complex and
nuanced enough that subsequent viewings will no doubt reveal new
treasures and clarify the minor rough edges -- yet it is also
compelling and moving on an immersive first viewing in the theater.
Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that, in spite of my
supposed knowledge of and sensitivity to film structure -- I was taken
by surprise when it ended and was in no way ready for it to end. Could
the full two hours have gone by that fast? How? And as I sit here
writing about it the next morning, if there were an opportunity to go
back and see it again tonight, I would do so without hesitation and,
quibbles aside, that&#x27;s a simple but ultimately profound recommendation.
