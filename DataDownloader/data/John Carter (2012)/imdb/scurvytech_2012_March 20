Granted that the E R Burroughs&#x27; tale has little in the way of depth, it
certainly plays better in the mind when being read than on the screen
when being viewed.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is not up to the task of carrying this movie and
director/writer Andrew Stanton doesn&#x27;t give him any help.<br /><br />The beginning offers some hope and the end provides some adrenal rush,
but the long middle is just that - LONG. It tries to be the next Star
Wars: A New Hope, but falls well short.<br /><br />If you are really curious about this film, rent it when it&#x27;s available,
but skip the cost of seeing it in a theater.
