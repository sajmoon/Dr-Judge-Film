Just got back from seeing John Carter. It is EXCELLENT!! I would call
it a must see for any sci-fi fan. I was a fan of the Marvel comic books
of the character too. They did an outstanding job of bringing all of
the characters to the screen in a well-thought out, believable way.
They gave all characters real screen time for us to get to know and
care about them. I haven&#x27;t seen this kind of thing in a LOOONG time at
the movies. The actors get to &#x22;act&#x22;,.. even the computer generated
ones. Such well-fleshed out characters. And more different alien
cultures introduced than any movie I can remember. I loved that we got
to see tribal cultures and their warriors. As well as, the shiny city
dwellers and their worlds. I thought it was all very, very well done.
But other comments were right about the boring title, John Carter.
Disney Really dropped the ball changing that title. I would go even
further and say that it should have had the much more interesting comic
book title, &#x22;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&#x22;.
