2012_March 25 
OK so I don&#x27;t go see movies too often. I was thinking something like
Lord of the Rings with maybe less Golum(scary) and more but toned down
battles. Turns out it was chock-full of battle scenes. I mean
chock-full. It basically starts with a battle/fight scene. They
continue with 2-5 second intervals of confusion between. Sick yet? They
last the whole movie, there in no love and the only companionship is
battle companionship. Nonstop through the whole movie. I saw it
yesterday and I am traumatized. I am so not joking. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve
never been in a fight but this movie would kill a four year old and
would give a 9 y.o. PTSD. Sorry I had to say that.
