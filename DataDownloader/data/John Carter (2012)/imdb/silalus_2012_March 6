When you hear that a film cost a quarter of a billion dollars to make,
you probably tend to form some expectations. When that movie is
directed and co-written by Pixar&#x27;s mighty Oscar machine Andrew Stanton
(WALL&#x95;E, Finding Nemo), those expectations ought to grow. And when that
movie is based on the story that inspired many of cinema&#x27;s greatest
sci-fi epics, well... your expectations probably begin to pile up very,
very high.<br /><br />And you know what? Leave &#x27;em all at home.<br /><br />John Carter is not at all the movie that you would expect based on all
of that- and believe it or not, that&#x27;s a good thing. Instead of trying
to be what you expect it to be, John Carter is boldly unashamed to be
exactly what it is: an over-the-top romp across Mars, a sweaty,
non-stop slugfest, and a ton of pure, unpretentious fun.<br /><br />In a sci-fi cinemascape where we&#x27;ve come to expect every protagonist to
be a poignantly flawed anti-hero and every villain to be a Campbellian
self-justified hero of their own story, this film is genuinely
refreshing in its lack of depth. The title character has just enough
back-story to let us sympathize with him while the forces he fights
against are wonderfully, one-dimensionally evil. High-tech airships and
teleportation devices coexist with civil-war era rifles and swords
without a hint of explanation. The romantic lead is an honest to
goodness damsel in distress. It sounds like a recipe for a truly, even
epically lousy movie. And yet...<br /><br />It works. And it works very, very well. The lack of depth takes nothing
away from the film and instead it simply doesn&#x27;t distract us. As best
as I can describe it, watching John Carter is like being served a
perfectly cooked steak without any stuff on top. Sure blue cheese
crumbles, mushrooms, and those sorts of things are great- but a really
good steak doesn&#x27;t need them.<br /><br />And what a steak it is! Every second of time saved by cutting out the
fluff is spent on brutal combat and spectacular flight sequences,
seasoned with occasional but perfectly timed moments of comedy.
Underlying it all is an excellent score by another Pixar great, Michael
Giacchino (who among other achievements won an Oscar with Up) and truly
bone-shaking audio effects. There is too much technical excellence here
for one review to list, and it comes together to bring you on one
fantastic ride.<br /><br />I was honestly surprised, but it all makes sense when you think about
it. The Edgar Rice Burroughs novels were pulp science fantasy- very
nearly westerns or even romances set in space. They were wonderfully
imaginative and vivid but they were also never intended to be great
studies of the human condition. Instead they were easy to read,
exciting, and really, really fun! That is, after all, how they captured
the imagination and inspired so many of the young men and women who
discovered them.<br /><br />By that measure, John Carter is a wonderful tribute to its source
material- and quite apart from that it&#x27;s a great film that is well
worth watching for some pure, lighthearted fun.
