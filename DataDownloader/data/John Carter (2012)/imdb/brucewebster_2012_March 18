This is the first movie that I&#x27;ve reviewed that I&#x27;ve given that good of
a review to. I&#x27;ve noticed that some other reviewers have compared this
favorably to Avatar. I can see the similarity - an abundance of special
effects, weird creatures and alien settings in most scenes. The movie
is stunning to look at from a special effects perspective also the 3D
is the best that I&#x27;ve seen ever. Usually I look at the 3D as being
something wasted, but not so here. I also got involved in the
characters and the story is good too. I am easily bored in movies but
not so this time. Anybody that enjoys action and special effects movies
will surely like this as will many others too.
