I wont&#x27;t dwell in the plot details, as I am sure you all ready know the
basic plot of John Carter. Let me instead start by saying, that John
Carter is rather unbalanced and undercooked movie despite it has been
in development longer than most stories. The story itself is almost 100
years old after all.<br /><br />The parts, that work in the movie, do so brilliantly. The martian
creatures are well made from the tharks to Woola and the great white
apes. The set design is fantastic and the airships are majestic. Design
wise there&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed in this movie. The cast is mostly
good, with the exception of Kitsch of who could be changed to an
another actor if a sequel is ever made. But then again it might have
been a fault of that Carter was as a character poorly written.<br /><br />The editing is also a hit and miss. The scenes with Carter in Earth in
the beginning are in a word poorly edited. There&#x27;s good actors
supporting Kitsch there as well, but the scenes just don&#x27;t work and the
attempted humor there felt forced and flat. The score didn&#x27;t help any
and at places it just sounds wrong in other places of the movie as
well.<br /><br />All in all the biggest failures in the movie fall entirely to the
shoulders of Stanton. At places he drives to movie with skill, but in
others he just seems to have lost his grip on what he was trying to
achieve.<br /><br />And then there&#x27;s the title of course, which is just plainly bad and non
descriptive. A princess of Mars, John Carter of Mars or Hero of Mars
would have been much better and interesting. But oh well.<br /><br />The movie is not a horrible failure mind you. It has its flaws, but all
in all, John Carter is entertaining enough. The character has been
introduced as has the world, so I do hope that a sequel would better
this all up.
