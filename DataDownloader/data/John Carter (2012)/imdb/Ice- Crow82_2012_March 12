Apparently the books on which this is based were way ahead off their
time, and influenced the likes off &#x22;Flash Gordon&#x22; and &#x22;Star Wars.&#x22;
Never being the biggest fan off either will probably mean my opinion on
this doesn&#x27;t matter. But I have to warn everyone, that if &#x22;John Carter&#x22;
goes as far back as they say. It is way too late too make a movie out
off it. As it is just your standard sci-fi movie idea by now.<br /><br />Being first written at a time where the idea of a man on Mars must off
seemed ridiculous. Its bad that even by today&#x27;s standards, after
countless &#x22;Star trek&#x22; like franchises, this still seems totally stupid.<br /><br />John Carter is a Civil war solider somehow transported too Mars, where
he encounters big tall green aliens. Like in anything you&#x27;ll see on the
Sci-fi channel these creatures have their own made up names for
everything, including the planet their on. I mean, couldn&#x27;t they just
off refereed to it as Mars the whole time? That would off had me losing
my patience with this dumb dumb movie a bit less. Overall some off what
these beings say is way too much. The Part that really got me
embarrassed though, was that the main place on Mars (where all the
trouble is afoot) is called Helium! ... Helium? ... Seriously? &#x85; That
stuff that makes your voice squeaky? They must say &#x22;Helium&#x22; like a
million times. Maybe if you took a drink every-time they said &#x22;Helium&#x22;
the film would become fun. Fair enough there are actually a handful off
genuinely fun gags in the film, but even the main running joke in the
flick really does start to wear thin by the half way mark.<br /><br />It may sound like I am nick-picking here but overall the film is just a
giant bore! I&#x27;m sure reading about this world was probably amazing to
some that got it in the early 1900&#x27;s. But too me, here, in 2012, it
just seemed like I kept looking at the time on my mobile phone to check
how long was left.<br /><br />There are some impressive effects, sure. But most stuff that comes out
these days has that. I personally, needed more from this. Not to
mention the plot holes and the most unconvincing romance ever. Not
things that would usually annoy me too much, but I was so bored by
&#x22;John Carter&#x22; that I thought I&#x27;d just mention that these faults are in
there too.
