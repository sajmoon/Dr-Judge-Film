Having read A Princess of Mars and waiting for this movie to be
released since pre-production, I took my seat in the cinema with a
huge, stupid grin on my face. What happened over the next couple of
hours will stick with me for years; I witnessed one of the most
impressive movies I&#x27;ve seen in a long while, yet still walked out with
a feeling of disappointment.<br /><br />Lets start with the ups...<br /><br />As with most people, I was blown away by the visuals. The barren
landscape served as a perfect backdrop for the beautifully realised
flora, fauna, architecture and machines. &#x22;Eye candy&#x22; is a phrase that
does little justice to the optic sm&#xF6;rg&#xE5;sbord that Stanton offers up.<br /><br />The script and the acting were believable, more-so than the execution
in Avatar, as well as the relationship between Kitsch and Collins,
there are several subtle character relationships that could easily be
over-done but the chemistry I found, was right on the money.<br /><br />Where the film falls down for me is the constant narrative explaining
where we are and what we&#x27;re watching. Rather than falling into the
world of Barsoom, finding our own way around and making our own mind up
as to the motives of the characters, we are blinkered and led down a
very narrow path. Some could and would argue that this is simply good
direction... a little nudge now again is fine, but incessant prodding
gets tiring after a while.<br /><br />Despite this, the stupid grin on my face was there the whole time, with
the exception of one sequence (which I won&#x27;t spoil) midway through the
movie where I had to summon all my testosterone to prevent me from
weeping like a 14 year old girl after her first viewing of Titanic.<br /><br />The ending was nothing short of perfect. So many movies these days
simply fizzle out in either an obvious or a sloppy way and I was
expecting nothing different here. How wrong was I?!<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a few more adventures on Barsoom to come, I
just hope in the next one we&#x27;re not spoon-fed the whole way through.
We&#x27;re big boys and girls, even if we haven&#x27;t got an intimate knowledge
of ERB&#x27;s novels, we can still figure it out...
