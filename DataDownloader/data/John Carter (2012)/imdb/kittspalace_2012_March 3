My Kids 15 and 9 enjoyed this along with me at the Disney movie premier
at Hollywood studios. The beginning started out slow, possibly because
we had never read the book or had any real idea what this movie was
about. Once the characters were introduced and the story was on it&#x27;s
way, it was full of action adventure. SO although we started out not
much enthused either way, by the end we were glued to our seats, and
kind sad it was over.<br /><br />What is John Carter about, it&#x27;s about a man who has nothing left to
loose and no longer cares about life, or death. A man lost, who goes in
search of treasure only to find trouble, and plenty of it. It&#x27;s an
action adventure with some comedy and love mixed into the ride. Well
worth seeing it in theaters and I would highly recommend 3D the effects
of 3d on this movie are incredible.
