2012_March 19 
Rather than go into a long winded review of all the details, as this
has been done already on this site, I would just like to say the
following :<br /><br />This film made for an enjoyable night out with my girlfriend, who
though not a scfi fan like myself did like it.<br /><br />Having read the books a fair time ago from what I remember the story
was fairly true to the books, which in some was doesn&#x27;t help as this
was written along time ago. If you put aside the technical details of
the science then it worked well as just and adventure story with a few
twists and some nice characters. <br /><br />Will be a shame if it totally flops as though not ground breaking it
was still good fun.
