Awesome movie!!! Really great job on the story line. The movie was at
just the right speed for the story line. The movie did not seem rushed
at all. Great combination of genre&#x27;s. The movie wasn&#x27;t sappy or action
pact to the point that it loses the story. Loved it! One of the better
movies I&#x27;ve seen in quite awhile. What really seals the deal for me is
that it ended with enough to sum up the movie but also enough to keep
you guessing. Tough thing to do in the right way.I really enjoyed it.
That&#x27;s really all I can think of right now but IMDb says this review
requires ten lines sooooooo: What does everyone else think? The reviews
on here rated it a 7. I think it was at least a 9. Please rate and let
everyone know what you thought. Personally I think the critics now a
days that rate movies, like in the paper or what not, are a little off
their rockers.
