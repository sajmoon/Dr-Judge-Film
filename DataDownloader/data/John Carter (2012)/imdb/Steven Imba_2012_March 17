At first, i felt reluctant to see this movie. I&#x27;m not interested with
the synopsis, the movie poster made me think that is kind of Tarzan
movie because the way its display the outfit of Taylor Kitsch (John
Carter). But i finally decided to watch this movie after my friend Eric
told me many people give this movie positive review. I&#x27;m glad I did.<br /><br />The way the director Andrew Stanton combine all of the pieces is
genius. It is like all of the plot support each other. One thing that
surprised me, i thing you must categorize this movie with one more
genre, that is Comedy. Yeah, the movie was also hilariously funny but
not diminish the action and the drama part of the movie.<br /><br />CMIIW, one mistakes i found about the movie was when John Carter first
transfer to the Barsoom, he only said one word. But through the movie,
we discovered that he must add 4 more words to transfer to and from
Barsoom. Strange for me.<br /><br />Anyway, it is an entertaining movie and recommended to be watched.
That&#x27;s all my review and thank you for reading :)
