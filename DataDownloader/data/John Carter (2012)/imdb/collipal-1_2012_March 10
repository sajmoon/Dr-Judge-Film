The fact that Disney, an eminently kid-friendly company, decided to
take to the big screen the adventures of John Carter (created in
mid-20th century by author Edgar Rice Burroughs) seemed strange,
because those tales were charged of brutal violence, female seduction
and racial concepts which could seem politically incorrect, nothing of
which is compatible with Disney&#x27;s traditional values. But anyway...even
though Burrough&#x27;s testosterone prose was quite diluted, the film John
Carter made an effort to keep the character&#x27;s spirit, and it also
offers us some magnificent special effects and a solid production
design. Unfortunately, the screenplay makes too many turns, and it
feels too dispersed in order to be genuinely satisfactory.<br /><br />To be honest, I read Princess of Mars many years ago; and I haven&#x27;t
read the rest of the books, so I&#x27;m not sure whether John Carter
incorporates elements of the other books, or if it was a free creation
from co-screenwriters Andrew Stanton (who was also the director),
Michael Chabon and Mark Andrews. But whatever the origin of the
screenplay is, it is so saturated of characters, cultural factions,
romance and action that it&#x27;s difficult to keep the interest whenever
there isn&#x27;t time for completely swallowing the confusing mythology of
&#x22;Barsoom&#x22; (the name brought to Mars by the natives), the weak political
intrigue (which tries to get complicated with the help of cosmic
conspirators) and the romance between Carter and the Princess of Mars
(no, she obviously isn&#x27;t naked the whole time in here, at the
difference of the way in which she was described by the dirty old man
Burroughs). Everything in this film happens very fast; there isn&#x27;t any
time in order to establish the relationships between the characters nor
to contemplate their development. Carter&#x27;s allies lack of a concrete
motivation, and the villains are bad because the screenplay says so. In
other words, John Carter includes enough material for two or three
movies; but when all that is compressed to 132 minutes, the result is a
film which tries to be too many things, without being very satisfactory
in any level.<br /><br />However, not everything is negative. As I previously said, John Carter
is a visually impressive film, and it successfully solves some
impossible concepts which appear on the book (such as the eight-legged
&#x22;horses&#x22;). Maybe Mars could have been more red and not be so similar to
the North American desert, but anyway...at least the creatures and
vehicles (which have some &#x22;steampunk&#x22; taste) compensate the frankly
terrestrial scenarios. What doesn&#x27;t work are the scenes in which Carter
makes huge jumps; and I&#x27;m not only talking about the atrocious &#x22;wire
work&#x22;, but also to the fact that they seem immune to the influence of
the mass, gravity and inertia. I&#x27;m not saying this because I was
looking for scientific realism, but because those scenes feel horribly
fake. As for the cast, Taylor Kitsch (who had already left me a bad
impression with his atrocious performance in X-Men Origins: Wolverine)
lacks of any credibility, charisma or presence in the leading role. The
same can be said about Mark Strong, who plays the main villain with
such a reluctance that I found his character completely exchangeable
with any of his minions. On the other hand, Lynn Collins brings energy
and conviction as the Princess. As for the digital characters, we have
an adequate voice work from Samantha Morton, Willem Dafoe and Thomas
Haden Church.<br /><br />In conclusion, John Carter managed to keep me moderately entertained
despite its various fails, and I never found it boring, so I think that
that is enough to consider it worthy of a slight recommendation.
However, that doesn&#x27;t avoid it from being a mediocre and not very
satisfactory film.
