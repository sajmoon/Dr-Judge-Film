I am so upset with Disney&#x27;s marketing team. John Carter is a great
movie! <br /><br />Wow. I went to the theaters SO scared that I was going to see the worst
movie of my life, and to my surprise it was great. I felt the same way
I felt after I watched Stanton&#x27;s Wall-E and Finding Nemo. John Carter
leans on the side of entertainment over bloodthirsty battles. But that
means that it is a great movie to bring your young teen kids to. <br /><br />John Carter is about finding hope when you think you cannot find it
again. It is also about realizing the things in life that matter cannot
be bought. Through all the adventures and confusion JC goes through on
this strange planet, he surprisingly goes on a journey where he
explores who and what he really is. This movie is interesting enough
that I will watch it again this weekend! <br /><br />Please critics should not dissuade people from seeing this.
