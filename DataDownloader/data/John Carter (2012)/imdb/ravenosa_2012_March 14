It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve seen such a flat fantasy film (can&#x27;t
really call it sci-fi). I&#x27;m thinking back to the 90&#x27;s with some of the
generic post-apocalyptic films we&#x27;d get. Actually, in the 80&#x27;s there
was &#x22;Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn&#x22; which is what I kept
thinking of when watching &#x22;John Carter&#x22;.<br /><br />The Good: if you like explosions, things explode. There are some
decently designed costumes, which would have been great in a completely
different film, not about Mars.<br /><br />The Bad: editing, screenplay, acting, characters, lack of rooting
interest in any of the main characters, lack of rooting interest in
action scenes.<br /><br />The Ugly: Lynn Collins acting. She was really, really trying, but the
heavy delivery with the British accent, she sounded like an extra from
&#x22;Spartacus: Gods of the Arena&#x22;.<br /><br />I kept waiting for Lucy Lawless to walk on screen and say, &#x22;can you
tone it down, it&#x27;s just a Disney movie? This isn&#x27;t a high school
Shakespeare play!&#x22; The scenery. Was it Utah or Arizona? I&#x27;m not sure
but the movie never took me to Mars.<br /><br />The jumping. Oh, the jumping.<br /><br />You want to understand why it failed? There are some great reviews that
really analyze all that went wrong with JC, from the curious decision
to open with a big, messy battle scene with establishing, well,
anything. At the end of the scene, you felt like the filmmakers were
saying, &#x22;we didn&#x27;t know a better way to introduce the bad guys, so here
ya go...&#x22; In general, motivation, drive behind any character was
totally missing. Just seemed like the actors weren&#x27;t really given much
direction as far as who they were supposed to be.<br /><br />Really sad. Terrible attempt at making a fantasy/sci-fi film. Already
dated. Already a failure the moment it hit the screen. You know a film
is that bad when the second you see a trailer you know it&#x27;s a dud.
