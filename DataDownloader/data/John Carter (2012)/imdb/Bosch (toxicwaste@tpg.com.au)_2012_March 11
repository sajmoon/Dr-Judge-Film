I came to this movie without having read the John Carter novels by
Edgar Rice Burroughs, but I am familiar with later writers of the weird
tale period, namely Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton
Smith to name three. So I knew what to expect in terms of SF fantasy.<br /><br />Essentially, JOHN CARTER the film is a missed opportunity, given that
it cost over $200 million US to make and had the likes of Andrew
Stanton hired to adapt an icon of American fantasy fiction.<br /><br />The main problem is the story. It fails to introduce the audience to
the world and cultures of Barsoom properly. THE LORD OF THE RINGS
accomplished this feat perfectly. Instead, here we are left with a
whole bunch questions about who, why, what, and how, in relation to
factions, cultures, technology, character motivations, physics, etc.
Also, the Martian landscapes should have looked redder and more alien
than they did.<br /><br />With considerable effort, I just took for granted the unfolding
narrative, and ignored all of the confusing events, missing plot
points, slim characterisation, and that ridiculous jumping nonsense.
But JOHN CARTER proves that George Lucas&#x27; massive blunder with the STAR
WARS prequels can happen to anyone, even to someone with a resume as
impressive as Andrew Stanton&#x27;s and much lower expectations to fulfill.<br /><br />JOHN CARTER could have been a triumph if it had preserved more of the
source material&#x27;s literary sensibilities. As it stands, the movie feels
both bloated and incomplete. Prime example? The title card at the end
even says JOHN CARTER ***OF MARS***. In the rush to cram as much
action, conflict and set pieces into the movie, the filmmakers forgot
how to tell an engaging story. As others have mentioned, the pacing is
all over the place, as is the tone, which switched from political
subterfuge to slapstick comedy to romance to battle scenes. Speaking of
which, I can&#x27;t be the only punter who is getting bloody sick of huge
CGI armies doing battle in a movie. Memo to filmmakers: CG war scenes
have become tedious to watch. Nobody can even follow what happens in
these virtual m&#xEA;l&#xE9;es, let alone care about the outcome. Ditto the now
obligatory arena sequence.<br /><br />I saw JOHN CARTER in 3D, and it looked horrible in places. Every time I
saw 2D vegetation in the middle distance, I cringed. Try this
experiment, kids: during the film, close one eye. If the face or
whatever you&#x27;re looking at doesn&#x27;t change, that means the filmmakers
didn&#x27;t bother mapping that element into 3D. For a $200 million plus
film, that seems to be inexcusable. Why not just release it in 2D,
instead of insulting audiences this way?<br /><br />There&#x27;s more to say, but other reviewers have already covered it. The
bottom line is...the bottom line. If JOHN CARTER flops, the studio and
filmmakers only have themselves to blame. Peter Jackson showed that it
is possible to adapt a complex fantasy novel, and turn it into a
financial and critical success. Let&#x27;s hope that his example does not
end up being the only one.
