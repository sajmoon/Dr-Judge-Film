2012_March 3 
I did only have modest expectations of this film as the trailer
reminded me a bit to much of Dune. Really surprised to find a film
which had a good plot line (albeit cynics will liken it to
Avatar-lite), well acted, reasonable characterisations, brilliant
visuals and a surprisingly good hero figure in Taylor Kitsch. I saw the
preview screening this morning - don&#x27;t really care how much it cost to
make - what I found was a big budget film that I really enjoyed from
start to finish. My advice - don&#x27;t follow the cynics and naysayers -
see it for yourself. I will normally not go see 3D films (they give me
a headache) but the 3D wasn&#x27;t too intrusive on this one.
