The pundits appear to have lost all sense of fun and wonder. This movie
was great. The action scenes were fantastic. Lynn Colins WAS &#x22;Deja
Thoris&#x22; and all of the myriad denizens of Mars came to life. Kitch had
a few weak scenes but otherwise did a great job of linking his pain
from the past to his disdain for the present, tempered by his
underlying sense of honor. Appropriately tepid at first his growing
chemistry with Collins&#x27; character fit the story to a tee. One has to
suspend disbelief for logical and scientific inconsistencies in such a
story, but if you do you will be treated to a rousing tale and a great
ride. I loved this movie and was very sorry when it ended because I
wanted more!
