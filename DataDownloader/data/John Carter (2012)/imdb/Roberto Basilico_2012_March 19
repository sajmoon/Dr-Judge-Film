I&#x27;m just back from an IMAX 3D experience with John Carter, the latest
Disney movie. I am pretty happy with it especially thanks to the last 5
minutes which turned out to made ALL the entire movie making sense, I
confess I was about to be pretty disappointed if the movie would have
been end with Carter marrying the Mars princess.<br /><br />As I say in the title, to me this movie was nothing more than a mix
between Avatar and the previous Disney movie Prince of Persia and I&#x27;ll
tell you why.<br /><br />AVATAR: Not only the aliens pretty much look like the avatar ones, but
even the Center of their religion is a huge tree, which this time is
DRY and the space shift again looked like the avatar ones.<br /><br />PRINCE OF PERSIA: the Idea of the trip in the desert of John Carter and
the Princess of Mars, not only that but the setting of their
relationship is pretty much the same: that kind of powerful man who
treats his girl mean sometimes but in the end loves her. John Carter
character was more Man rather than Jake Gyllenhal I have to say though.<br /><br />About the department: <br /><br />Photography: nice and well done. I liked the 3d and the panoramic view
of the scenes. I would say something more could have been done to make
the fighting scenes more entertaining.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />music: honest and pleasant, I don&#x27;t remember it so probably was not
that special, but at the same time, it never get out of theme and stays
perfectly in line with the moods of the scenes.<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />costumes and locations: I liked the Roman style of the martians, and
the simplicity of Carter one. The aliens were nice looking, I would say
they look like the Street Fighter Indian warrior. and locations were
OK, again nothing that special, but OK.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />editing: good and simply, straight to the point, I would give an 8 to
it because of the nice interlace of the first and last scenes. the ones
of the earth. I liked that.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />director: I would have expect more from the actors at some point, and
also some camera shot could have been better.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />I don&#x27;t really want to continue forever with this analytic thing, let
just say that I have to admit at one point I kinda feel asleep, so
don&#x27;t expect a master piece. It is a nice movie, not a MUST SEE, so
look around, there might be other worthwhile seeing. Disney could do
better I&#x27;m sure.
