2012_March 8 
So i walked into this film not knowing anything about it, only by what
i saw in the trailer (which like others have said gives you nothing to
go on.) I sat in the theater as the opening happened and thought &#x22;what
have i walked into&#x22;. I thought it was going to be really dull and
lifeless. From the start you get that western fell to it...not so much
dull like Cowboys &#x26; Aliens. You get that John has a past as he is
always reckless and doesn&#x27;t give much to anything but himself. The
story is pretty plain until John finally gets to Mars...and that when
the movie really turned around for me.<br /><br />From here on in the movie its just plain fun adventure. Kind of like
when you are watching Indiana Jones. Some parts of the movie you sit
and fell like its going for to long but then it picks up and something
else is happening. I agree when people say that they feel they tried to
cram so much into a 2Hr movie which they might have but if you think
about it, you will notice a bit of plot holes.<br /><br />The acting in the film isn&#x27;t anything we haven&#x27;t seen before. Lynn
Collins does an alright job. At first i didn&#x27;t think much of her but as
she progressed on screen i started to see her differently - a princess
confident to stop the fall of her hometown. Taylor Kitsch does an OK
job, i feel like some of the dialogue wasn&#x27;t the best and feel like he
could of had more emotions in scenes then just yelling or being pretty
placid.<br /><br />At the end of the movie i felt like i went to a little adventure on
Mars myself. I felt happy with what i saw. Most people will walk out
with &#x22;Been there, seen that&#x22;. But with a little research you will find
out that the movie is based on a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs &#x22; A
Princess of Mars&#x22; that was written in 1912. With that you find out that
it brought inspiration to Sci-Fi movies like Star Wars and Indiana
Jones.<br /><br />Overall if you want to see a visually stunning movie and a classic
adventure then John Carter will be for you. If not then i would avoid
seeing it.
