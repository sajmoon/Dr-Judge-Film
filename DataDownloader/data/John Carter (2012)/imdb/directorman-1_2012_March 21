Nearly a century ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote the first of many John
Carter novels. It&#x27;s very much vintage science fiction; the novels went
on to inspire minds like George Lucas and James Cameron, who created
their own adventures with many throwbacks to Burroughs&#x27; work. Despite
numerous efforts, John Carter did not make it to the big screen until
2012 under the direction of Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton. It&#x27;s
Stanton&#x27;s first live action film, and is clearly meant to be a huge
event like Star Wars. <br /><br />You&#x27;ve probably seen the confusing and rather stupid trailers. With
this, you probably also have no idea whatsoever what this film is
about. John Carter is a reluctant soldier in the Civil War who stumbles
upon a strange cave and medallion that transports him to Mars. Mars is,
in fact, inhabited by multiple races of Tharks (15 foot tall aliens)
and humans, who are in the middle of planet spanning wars. Carter finds
himself in the middle of this political controversy and ends up
confronting the evil forces threatening to destroy the planet.<br /><br />It&#x27;s plain and simple cheesy vintage science fiction. That&#x27;s really all
this ever was and all it is. As someone who would lump Star Wars into
that same category, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m saying that as a condemnation of
the film. This is simply the genre we&#x27;re dealing with here. If you&#x27;re
into this sort of thing, definitely go see John Carer because it&#x27;s
really not all that bad of a film. It has plenty of problems, but is
entertaining enough for what it is. The largest differentiating factor
between John Carter and Star Wars doesn&#x27;t come from the direction or
even the outlandish stories, but rather in the simple talent of
casting.<br /><br />Star Wars is fun not only because it has interesting special effects,
but because there is a great cast that&#x27;s clearly having a lot of fun
together. The main reason why the prequels failed was because there was
no one as charismatic and charming as Han Solo to keep things out of
pure science fiction. This is a guilty pleasure genre that needs a
charming lead to justify watching to the masses. John Carter is a
character who could easily have combined the traits of a Luke Skywalker
and a Han Solo, only we have Taylor Kitsch here playing it straight and
lacking completely in the charm department. There&#x27;s no real chemistry
in the love story and he&#x27;s rather wooden. This is a big problem, and
keeps the film from really being fun. Basically, you need a Harrison
Ford to carry a film like this, and Taylor Kitsch is no Harry Ford.<br /><br />As it is, it&#x27;s not necessarily fun, but it&#x27;s an interesting two hours
where you learn a lot of information about Burrough&#x27;s universe. It&#x27;s
not anything that groundbreaking in the modern age where these stories
are fairly common. The characters adequately serve the story while
never really being anyone you root for. This keeps you at a distance,
while not exactly turning you off completely. As I&#x27;ve said, there are
plenty of problems that keep John Carter from being a successful epic,
but it does not deserve the horrible reputation it currently holds. <br /><br />So, you&#x27;re left with a mixed bag that&#x27;s interesting to look at. Is that
enough for you? I can kind of appreciate the throwback to old science
fiction as well as old Hollywood epics. That&#x27;s enough for me for two
hours, but you should take a lot more into consideration when you&#x27;re
making a $250 million investment on something like this.<br /><br />http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?
