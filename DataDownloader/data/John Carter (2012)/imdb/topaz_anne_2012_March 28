I&#x27;m not going to write a long review with John Carter as it doesn&#x27;t
really deserve it.<br /><br />I expected more on this film. I expected more battle scenes, as that&#x27;s
what it appeared to be on the trailer when he was fighting these giant
monsters. The only battle scene that they had was at the end which
lasted for probably 2 minutes or so.<br /><br />The movie was very slow. they just kept on talking and talking which
made it really boring. It just dragged! A lot of talk and no action at
all. I fell asleep twice in the cinema.<br /><br />The only thing that I like with the movie is it was kind of funny.
