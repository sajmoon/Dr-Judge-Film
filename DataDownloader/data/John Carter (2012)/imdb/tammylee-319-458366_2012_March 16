John Carter has action from the get go. I found this to be a very
exciting movie. Beautiful scenery, ships and costumes. For those who
have read the books we all know the characters in the movie are
actually wearing more clothes than they did in the books. I feel that
even though some liberties were taken with the storyline in the movie
that are not in the book Disney did a fantastic job recreating this
story. I am hoping for a sequel. <br /><br />Edgar Rice Burroughs was one of the main contributors to the scifi/
fantasy genre. I just don&#x27;t believe that we would have all of the
wonderful books and movies that we have today without John Carter.
