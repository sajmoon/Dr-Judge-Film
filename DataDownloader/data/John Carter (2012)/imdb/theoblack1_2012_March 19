I have not been this happy about seeing a movie in the theater since
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The story was great, it was exiting,
romantic, funny, dramatic and powerful (The only thing I did not get
was the main objective of the bad guys other than to ruin everyone&#x27;s
lives but I&#x27;m going to see it again). All the actors could really
really act. The effects were Avatar good without the Avatar. The sound
was Skywalker, Costumes were breathtaking and the directing was
masterful. I usually just rent and if I have to own a movie I download
it on itunes or buy a copy from blockbuster. This movie I will see in
the theater two more times and I&#x27;m getting it on blu ray. It is a movie
that needs to be seen in blu ray on in the theater. Seeing this on your
phone would be wrong. I don&#x27;t want to spoil anything and I won&#x27;t but if
you liked The Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie. Hell, if you
like looking at stupid hot men and women you will like this movie. I
loved it. All of it. I don&#x27;t care that Disney made it. I loved it!
