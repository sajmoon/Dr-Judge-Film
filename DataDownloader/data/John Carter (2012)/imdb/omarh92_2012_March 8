One of the fathers of sci-fi was finally brought life. Brought to life
in an entertaining way for room of improvement, but a satisfying movie
indeed. Normally movies always have room to be better. John Carter
could&#x27;ve been better with a slightly better pick of cast since the
acting was not as powerful as expected. A better job of cinematography,
maybe better camera equipment might have enhanced the picture quality
but better angles and direction. The special effects really needed
improvement, they were good and visually great but you would want to
see more. The story is a classic, I did not read the original story but
I do suspect there are some unoriginal parts. By watching this movie,
you can tell how it inspired many Sci-fi movies today such as Dune or
Star Wars or Total Recall. John Carter will satisfy you, off course you
will tell to yourself that &#x22;it could be better&#x22; but most Hollywood
movies are like that nowadays.
