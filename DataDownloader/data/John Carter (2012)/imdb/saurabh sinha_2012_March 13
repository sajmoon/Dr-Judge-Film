2012_March 13 
I had taken a day off from work and wanted to just chill out.
Unfortunately, I chose john Carter to start the day. As it turned out
to be painfully ludicrous, I walked of this movie while 15-20 minutes
were still left. Yes, It&#x27;s the first movie ever I&#x27;ve walked out off in
my lifetime. Loads of over-acting(&#x27;My name is carter, john carter&#x27; in a
stylized coarse voice), a plot that makes no sense, scripts and
characters derived from various other movies like avatar, etc. and a
scantily clad &#x27;princess&#x27; who doesn&#x27;t know how to act and is not even
attractive make this movie dreadfully clich&#xE9;d. A counter-argument for a
possible argument - Even the kids were getting restless. Some of them
even walked out. It is quite disappointing that Stanton being so
talented made such an obvious dud. Maybe, he should limit himself to
what he&#x27;s best at - animation movies. TLDR: Avoid this movie.
