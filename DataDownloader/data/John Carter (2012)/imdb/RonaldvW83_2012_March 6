Hasn&#x27;t the time come for the movie going audience to stop giving
passable grades to movies, merely because they have nice looking
visuals? Personally, i think that time has come. And it is because of
the movie John Carter.<br /><br />Yet again we are treated with the same old formula that we have seen
million times before. The handsome hero, the damsel in distress with
big breasts, the bad guy with a scar on his face and CGI aliens that
came rolling right out of one of the Star Wars prequels (read: lifeless
puppets that stand out like a sore thumb.) The story is predictable
from start to finish and there were more plot holes then i could count.
I could have forgiven all of this if ANY of the characters had any form
of depth to them and made me care something about all the boring action
sequences. They don&#x27;t.<br /><br />My advice: watch the trailer for Avatar again, imagine instead of a
forest setting that it&#x27;s a desert setting, and a dog with six legs for
comic relief. There. I have saved you the cost of your ticket as well
as the unpleasant feeling of holding your pee in for too long. And
nausea.
