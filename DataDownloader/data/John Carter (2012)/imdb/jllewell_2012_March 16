I give it four stars for the effects, which are worth seeing.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve been a fan of Edgar&#x27;s since I was about seven years old... they&#x27;ve
Disneyed it.<br /><br />Blahhhh... Why do they do this? <br /><br />Do they really believe that their public is that mind numbingly dumb? <br /><br />Yes they do. <br /><br />Are the powers at Disney that mind numbingly dumb themselves? <br /><br />Quite possibly.<br /><br />I hated when they made a Kiddy Cartoon about the Little Mermaid, that
haunting Andersen Fairytale, where she dies at the end.... <br /><br />They&#x27;ve kiddy-fied this, as well. <br /><br />Again, Blahhhh.
