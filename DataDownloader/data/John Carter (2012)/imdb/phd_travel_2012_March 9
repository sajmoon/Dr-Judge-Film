This is a grand epic adventure story with historical, cowboy, science
fiction and gladiator elements all rolled into one. Production is
extravagant with epic battles and sweeping desert scenes for Mars. It&#x27;s
adventure without gore since Disney did it - the family can watch it.
The CGI is there but it&#x27;s not too overdone. <br /><br />The good points are: the story. There is a proper story which is
something recent movies are lacking. Whether some of it makes total
sense or not doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s old fashioned in a good way - an
adventure story and a proper ending - in a Star Wars, HG Wells - Time
Machine way. Although the martians looked a bit Avatar they are less
irritating. There are some moments of humor though there could have
been more. The jumping around is quite fun. <br /><br />The actors are well chosen. I like Lynn Collins for this role. While
not the most beautiful actress out there, she is convincing and the
right blend of statuesque princess and action heroine. She has a
slightly ethnically ambiguous look which suits the science fiction
genre. Taylor Kitsch is good. He isn&#x27;t too overbuilt so he remains
realistic for the story which isn&#x27;t a superhero story. They made him a
bit too scruffy and tired looking in parts. <br /><br />Minus Points: The battle between the various Martian factions is a bit
heavy and tedious. Don&#x27;t really care about who is fighting who. It
could have lost about 20 minutes - some scenes are repetitive but at
least you get your money&#x27;s worth.<br /><br />Overall catch it on the big screen - it&#x27;s worth a watch.
