I grew up reading reprints the Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs in
the late 50&#x27;s to mid 60&#x27;s and I loved them. Today, for me they&#x27;re
almost unreadable. He wasn&#x27;t a great writer, his was the prose of
another time and medium, pulp magazines. However, that said his
imagination was fabulous and truly worthy of his legacy. He created
fantastic worlds peopled by heroes and villains worthy of Dumas. Like
J. K. Rowlings his worlds were fully realized with customs and history
established for his Martian, Venusian and center of the Earth
civilizations. In a way its sad that he he is mostly remembered for his
creation of Tarzan the Ape Man.<br /><br />Hollywood from 1918 on has over the years filmed his works, most
Tarzan, with widely varying results. Today I saw John Carter and for my
money filmdom has finally got it right. It&#x27;s a long movie, over two
hours,and I wasn&#x27;t bored for one minute of it. True it&#x27;s script is not
a literal translation of his 1912 work &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22; but the
characters and the world of Barsoom (Mars) and wonderfully brought to
life and I had a marvelous time.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t look for depth or meaning in this film, its a pure popcorn movie
that harks back to the Jon Hall/Maria Montez series of the 40&#x27;s, the
swashbucklers of Errol Flynn, current superhero flicks with a bit of
sudsy romance tossed in. The hero is stalwart, the heroine is drop dead
gorgeous, can actually act and the CGI spectacular. It&#x27;s a hoot, a romp
and in 3D heck of a lot of fun. Don&#x27;t analyze it just enjoy the fun and
the froth.
