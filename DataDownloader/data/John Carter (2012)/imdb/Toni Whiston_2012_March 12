2012_March 12 
Everyone in my family enjoyed this movie. I will not give away any
details so hopefully people will get out to see it...I would rather see
a movie like this than those pathetic &#x22;Clash of the Titan&#x22; or &#x22;GI Joe&#x22;
movies, which somehow have gotten sequels. I really hope it generates
enough revenue to get a sequel or even a series of movies. I thought
Taylor Kitsch did a great job...he reminds me of a young Timothy
Olyphant and I am a big fan, so I mean it as a compliment. I would
never let a critic dictate whether or not I see a movie. I think any
kid who is old enough to see a Harry Potter movie could easily enjoy
this movie. I am a 49 year old female, and enjoy things that entertain
me and it certainly did that.
