I first read the John Carter of Mars series when I was in junior high
school. This series really kicked off everything that followed for me
from reading, to movies, to Dungeons and Dragons and wanting to do my
own writing some day.<br /><br />To say that I was excited about the upcoming movie is an
understatement.<br /><br />However, when the movie opened, I was disappointed when I started
hearing the critics reviews and lack of money it made for opening
weekend. What had they done to my movie? Of course, I had to see it for
myself even if I was to be disappointed.<br /><br />Having now seen the movie, I have to ask myself if the critics saw the
same movie I saw and should they consider another profession. This
movie was awesome. Changes may have been made to fit the different form
of media and available time, but this movie really captured what I
liked and experienced when I read the books. The actors, creatures,
ships, clothing, everything rocked! Ignore the critics and see this
movie. Tell your friends to see it, your coworkers, your in laws,
neighbors, the person sitting by you on the bus! When this comes out on
DVD (Blue Ray, of course) I hope they have an extended version. I will
buy it in a heartbeat.<br /><br />One last thing to say on this movie: I want a sequel!!!!
