Hello everyone, You know, when I got done with John Carter, I was
excited, the movie, the action, the ending, all priceless. Now, you
wouldn&#x27;t know this from the trailers, a guy with no shirt on jumping
higher than humanly possible with strange aliens doesn&#x27;t exactly make
you want to head to the movies. At first, I didn&#x27;t want to go either,
however I remembered that this was the story Avatar was based on, Star
Wars drew heavily from this inspired piece. As well they should, John
Carter was one of those movies that drew you in within the first few
minutes an didn&#x27;t let go. It was an old school science fiction
adventure all the way down to the dress, the ships, and the
performances. <br /><br />Funny, exciting, and breath taking, John Carter is a movie experience
that is not to be missed.
