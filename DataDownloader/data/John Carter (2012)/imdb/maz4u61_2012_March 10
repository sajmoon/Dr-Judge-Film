I just came home watching John Carter. First of all, i will clear any
similarity with StarWars or any other science fiction movie. There are
not much similarity between star-wars. I am judging this movie only
based on merits. And i am somehow surprise to say that it is a good
movie. The action is good, the scenery, and a bit of humour. The movie
is well paced too. But then, when i left the theatre, i felt there was
something missing. The movie has no soul. It needs character
development. The one thing i really liked is the printing art on those
people. WOW!!!! The princess looks really beautiful. Overall, it is an
enjoyable movie.
