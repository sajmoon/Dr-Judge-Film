The success of Avatar keeps the heads of the world movie corporations
awake at night. Cameron managed to create another world, populate it
with unusual yet charismatic creatures, create a conflict with humans,
drop the main character in and let us watch the development of the
story. What sounds simple in theory found a great response in peoples&#x27;
hearts, allowing Avatar to take in a lot of profit and leaving fans
waiting for the sequel. John Carter is so obviously trying to be the
second Avatar, it is impossible to escape from comparisons. And
comparisons are, unfortunately for John Carter, not in its favor.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book &#x22;Princess of Mars&#x22; by Edgar Rice
Burroughs, being yet another example of how the movie industry is
unable to come up with its own original plots. But that is not a
problem, particularly given the fact that Burroughs is thought to have
inspired Lucas and Cameron. The problem is that Disney decided to make
the film, reducing sharply all the harsh parts to fit into the &#x22;family
movie&#x22; category. John Carter lost immensely because of this. The
storyline is dry, straightforward and simple. It is predictable if you
watched any Disney movie at all. Princess? Check.
Misfit-but-good-person? Check. Outsider? Check. Cute animal? Check.
Evil super-powerful genius? Check. Disney&#x27;s production line is working
day and night to produce clich&#xE9; movies.<br /><br />But even tedious storyline does not mean the movie is bad. There still
is some hope &#x96; in action part, in smart dialogues, in carefully drawn
characters&#x85; But leave your hopes: action is little and still pretty
boring. Dialogues are dull, silly and, worse of all, intolerably long.
Coupled with predictable storyline, long dialogues make it a pretty big
nail into the coffin of John Carter. The storyline jumps around almost
randomly, leaving huge logical gaps and holes in the plot. The
characters are there as if only to play their part in the main
storyline: they have no past and no future. You are left to guess their
intentions and motives. The movie is boring, the characters are plain
and tasteless. Even Mark Strong fails to bring the arch-enemy to life
despite his huge portfolio of evil characters. Smart, ingenious in the
book, here the character looks a bit clumsy and definitely not scary.
Other actors understandably fail as well, with Lynn Collins playing
top-model rather than princess, with Taylor Kitsch playing emotionless
wooden soldier rather than opportunistic adventure-seeker. Willem Dafoe
lent his voice to Tars Tarkas, but this four-handed king is opaque in
his motives as well as all the other characters, making it impossible
to enliven him.<br /><br />Now onto the technical part. It is well-known fact that John Carter has
the budget of $250m. The question is where all the money was spent. 3D
does not bring any extra emotions as there are no particular effects
based on it. Compare it with Avatar or Hugo, and you will ask why one
would want to use 3D in the first place. The Martian land is the best
representation of the movie as a whole: plain and boring, grey and dry.
The movie fails to impress with CGI and looks more like Star Wars
Episode 4 than modern age technological breakthrough.<br /><br />VERDICT: Boring, non-inspiring, dull and grey movie; Pale shadow of the
underlying book.<br /><br />m-picturegoer.blogspot.com
