2012_March 8 
First off, don&#x27;t let the &#x27;professional reviews&#x27; fool you. Rotten
Tomatoes or Metacritic aren&#x27;t always 100 percent accurate. You will
just have to see the movie for yourself and form your own opinion.<br /><br />Now this film is probably not in anyone&#x27;s shortlist for the next
Academy Awards ceremony, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its not a good movie.
The CGI and Mars Scenery was beautiful. I&#x27;m sure this could end up with
a Visual Effects nomination next Oscar season. This movies best
compliment can be its eye candy visuals.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to give anything away of course because its always best
to walk in with no expectations. Many think this will be the next
Pirates of The Caribbean type franchise for Disney. I highly doubt it
will do for Taylor Kitsch what the original Pirates did for Johnny
Depps career though. Many will most remember this actor for his role as
Gambit in the X-men Wolverine movie. But to most of us he is a new face
and for many people it&#x27;s hard to buy into a movie without many familiar
faces. But lets get back to the film. I honestly felt the beginning of
the film started off slow. It tried to be goofy and humorous to get you
used to the John Carter character, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t as engaging as
other Disney films like Pirates, National Treasure, and Tron Legacy. It
wasn&#x27;t a bad beginning but it wasn&#x27;t anything special. When we get to
Mars the story starts to take off a bit more and the visuals will of
course blow you away. I knew that director Andrew Stanton wouldn&#x27;t
disappoint. His previous films were all animated(Finding Nemo and
Wall-E) making this his first Live Action effort. You can really see
the Wall-E type scenery in the Mars Deserts of the film. I know I keep
mentioning the Visuals, but its truly because this movie is great Eye
Candy. Now honestly, the storytelling isn&#x27;t the best and the plot is
pretty much recycled even though its based on a book that was published
exactly a Hundred years to the date of the movies release, fun fact.
Now let me say this, the movie has some pretty cool action scenes and
Gladiator type fights. This will surely keep some action lovers happy
until &#x27;The Hunger Games&#x27; or &#x27;Wrath of The Titans&#x27; are released. Yes,
there is a woman that the main character develops romance with and the
&#x27;people in need of a hero&#x27; story. The plot is what you&#x27;ve seen many
times before, but this time on Mars. This isn&#x27;t bad at all. But its
nothing special. I&#x27;m not sure this movie will rack up the cash like
other Disney Blockbusters did though since like I said earlier there is
few star power. So this movie isn&#x27;t the best Disney has had to offer in
a while. The story will mostly attract people new to the Science
Fiction genre, but people who have been around since the 90s or earlier
will be less enthusiastic to see this. I&#x27;m honestly not a die hard
Science Fiction fan but I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Easily the
first epic movie of 2012. It surely doesn&#x27;t match the magic of the
recent Tron Legacy but its still a pretty good experience if you wanna
just enjoy some good ole Disney magic. Just don&#x27;t read too much into
the negative reviews it has been getting. I mean come on, the recent
Oscars awards were obviously biased to the &#x27;professionals&#x27;. So don&#x27;t be
fooled by movie critics on this movie. I say see this whenever you get
the chance. It will have a lot of competition in theaters but when its
released on Blu Ray and DVD it should get more attention.
