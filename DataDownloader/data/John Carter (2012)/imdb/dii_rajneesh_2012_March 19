Saw the movie yesterday. Truth be told, the underlying concept has been
beaten to atoms.<br /><br />Talking creatures, worm holes, anti gravity ships and the entire
paraphernalia of odds and ends that are expected of a sci-fi flick have
been used in the movie barring the story. In the good old twentieth
century we were subjected to challenges via the storyline and script.
Imagination and story telling have become inversely proportional to the
speed of computers. CG has become sugar cotton candy. Looks big from
the outside but soon melts away into nothing.<br /><br />Please Hollywood take note &#x22;Don&#x27;t Make 3D movies&#x22;. Had this movie been
in the regular format I would have added at-least another 3 stars but
alas it was not to be so. It felt so much better to see the movie
removing the 3D glasses from time to time. Well, I had to do something
sitting in the seat for 2 hours waiting for the movie to end. 3D is
totally destroying the movie going experience. Where, the creatures
could have looked magnificent on the regular format looked like peeking
out of a 40&#x22; television screen wearing those glasses. I thank GOD that
movies like Gladiator, Matrix and other such great movies were not made
in 3D.<br /><br />I know I was supposed to write a review of the movie. But I did not
find anything to write about. Please do yourself a favor and stay away
from the movie. Spending time with family/friends would do more good.
