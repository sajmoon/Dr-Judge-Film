For starters, Wonderful set, character designs and effects, However it
is totally ruined by the pace of the movie, its plot, the unbearable
acting, and numerous illogical instances within the movie. The female
leads acting is unbearable... Her happiness, sadness or whatsoever were
just in general bad. What bothered me the most is that many parts of
the movie makes no sense. Carter has the power to kill one of the green
guys with one blow but unable to shake loose a choke hold? With john
carters muscle strength, no swords man should be able to even have
contact with his swords without either damage on the swords or thrown
far... and so on. Overall, more effort upon the plot could have gone
into this movie...
