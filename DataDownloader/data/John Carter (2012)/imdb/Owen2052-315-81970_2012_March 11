First the bad news: it&#x27;s not Star War IV - VI. Now the good news: it&#x27;s
not Star Wars I -III, either.<br /><br />What it is is a faithful reinterpretation of A Princess of Mars, by
Edgar Rice Burroughs. True, the plot has been streamlined, altered and,
in some places, out right changed. And yet the important characters are
well drawn. Tars Tarkas, Sola, Deja Thoris, Woola, and John Carter look
and act like the characters in the novel. <br /><br />I found the special effects convincing and, in some cases, fun. I
enjoyed watching John Carter jump. I loved Woola. The arena scene with
the Great White Apes is clearly the film&#x27;s centerpiece.<br /><br />Some people found the plot a bit confusing. I agree. The machinations
of the holy therns lost me. Why not just turn the ninth ray on Helium
and be done with it? But then silly sincerity of both the heroes and
the villains in John Carter mimic the over drawn dramatics of Edgar
Rice Burroughs novels.<br /><br />I read Princess of Mars over forty years ago and enjoyed seeing it on
screen.
