I first read &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22; in third grade. The book, and its
sequels, quickly became my favorite piece of fiction. It is fair to say
that I cannot think of a movie I have been anticipating for a longer
time and that I am completely incapable of being truly objective about
&#x22;John Carter.&#x22; With that in mind, I still think that my disappointment
with the movie has less to do with emotional attachment and expectation
than with clich&#xE9;d writing.<br /><br />For those of you who aren&#x27;t up on your turn of the century proto-scifi
novels, &#x22;John Carter&#x22; is based a book by the same author who created
Tarzan. The eponymous hero is a civil war veteran and gold prospector
who gets transported to Mars where he gets entangled in the planet&#x27;s
complex politics and near endless wars. He makes friends with several
giant four-armed green skinned martian, he falls in love with a
beautiful red-skinned human-looking martian princess, and he ends up in
conflict with just about the entire rest of the planet. All of this
allows for some wonderful chasing, exciting action scenes, and even fun
airship battles.<br /><br />As far as action goes this movie is adequate to excellent depending on
the scene. However, it takes its time building up to these sequences
engaging in complicated and frankly uninterested set up scenes. Even
after the John Carter&#x27;s arrival on mars the movie keeps using a poorly
developed &#x22;tragic backstory&#x22; to delay the inevitable. I wouldn&#x27;t
complain about attempts to flesh out the hero&#x27;s character if they
weren&#x27;t so trite, overworn, and, ultimately, pointless. However, the
movie is well acted and does, eventually, kick into gear. If you are
patient it is rewarding enough. And, if the sequel gods are kind, we
might get less filler or (even better) interesting character
development in the next film.
