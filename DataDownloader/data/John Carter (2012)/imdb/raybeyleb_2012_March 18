Just reviewing the film following a screening with my 10 year old and
14 year old. My daughter 10 thought it was wow, my son 14, thought it
was OK.....as for me, a lover of the sci fantasy genre, I can safely
say that the caramel popcorn I enjoyed during the movie was a) more
enjoyable b) had more interest c) showed more LIFE than any of the
cardboard cutout actors who collected their paycheck for this turkey.<br /><br />All I can say is that Disney, the director and whoever else was
responsible for this diatribe should seek other careers as tanking $250
million on this dog is reprehensible.<br /><br />Nice to see some &#x27;Rome&#x27; stars in it, that&#x27;s about all that took my
interest. The Princess Mahogany was instantly forgettable, as was the
CGI. <br /><br />I have to say that the dog / monster thing was bar far the best actor
in the film and should be nominated for an Oscar. The rest should
Barsoom off somewhere with their tails between their legs in shame.
