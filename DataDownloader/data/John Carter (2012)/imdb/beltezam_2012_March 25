I read the Edgar Rice Burroughs book on which the movie was based, when
I was a 12 year old girl, about 60 years ago, in the attic of my
grandparents farmhouse in Michigan. It was with a collection of Tarzan
books which must have belonged to my father since he was a great Tarzan
fan, I had pretty much forgotten the John Carter stories until I saw
the movie advertised. I took my sister to see the movie for her 69th
birthday and we both enjoyed it immensely. It was extremely difficult
to not regress to childhood and kick the backs of the seats and throw
popcorn as we did when watching Tarzan movies those many, many years
ago. A thoroughly enjoyable movie. I have to insist my grandchildren
(most of them are adults now) go and see it since I never could get
them to read my Tarzan book collections. Can&#x27;t wait for it to come out
on DVD.
