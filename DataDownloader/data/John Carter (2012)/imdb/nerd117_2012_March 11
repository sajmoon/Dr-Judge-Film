There are a few spoilers in this review, but don&#x27;t worry, it won&#x27;t be
anything major.<br /><br />I wanted to love John Carter, I really did, but sadly I ended up only
loving small parts of it. With Andrew Stanton (Oscar winning director
and writer of classics like Finding Nemo and Wall*e) at the helm , and
the film being an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; beloved class &#x22;A
Princess of Mars,&#x22; I thought this picture could do no wrong. As it
turns out, this film ended up being very disappointing.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the movie is that the basic storyline is far
too boring. Only a few ounces of suspense are produced and the entire
middle third of the film sags heavily with only a couple standout
moments. There are in fact, several scenes that are almost completely
unnecessary and only make the film feel more cumbersome. Ironically,
one of of those relatively unnecessary scenes ends up being my
favorite, and in my opinion, the best part of the entire film.<br /><br />This scene involves John Carter (and his little, alien-dog-friend who I
will get to later) fighting off an entire legion of enemies called the
&#x22;Warhoon&#x22; in order to give Dejah Thoris and a &#x22;Thark&#x22; (9 foot tall,
green, 4 armed, and barbaric inhabitants of Mars) named Sola the time
to escape. During this battle scene, there several cutaways to brief
clips that give us an insight into Carter&#x27;s depressing past. This scene
is made incredibly well made and when it cuts from Carter killing these
&#x22;Warhoon&#x22; by the dozen to him burying his wife and child, you&#x27;d have to
be pretty cold-hearted not to feel at least a little emotion. This
sequence also gives us a chance to see how bad-ass John Carter really
is.<br /><br />The film also has too much cheesy dialogue. Some of the things the
characters say are just a little too unnatural, while some of the lines
are just plain cringe-worthy. Other films reminiscent of John Carter
such as Star Wars and Avatar (two better films which are actually
heavily inspired by &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22; ) also have the same problem,
but those films had many great aspects to them while this film only has
a few.<br /><br />In terms of villainy, it is hard to get more boring than the ones in
John Carter. The two main villains, a Thern (seemingly all-powerful,
shape shifting, priest-like characters who feed off destruction) named
Matai Shang (Strong) and a Zodangan (a warlike race which is sucking
Mars&#x27; resources dry) King called Sab Than (West,) are very
underdeveloped, but this actually turns out to be a good thing because
they are so severely uninteresting. They use this weapon called the
&#x22;9th Ray&#x22; which is pretty much a blue light that allows them to destroy
everything they want. This weapon doesn&#x27;t make for anything threatening
and it ends up relying on the only visual effect in the movie that
doesn&#x27;t look fantastic.<br /><br />I thought that for the most part, the acting ranged from decent to
good. Taylor Kitsch is fine in the title role, but nothing more. I felt
as if they could have found someone who a looked a little more
masculine for the part but that is my only real gripe. Lynn Collins is
extremely beautiful and charming as Dejah Thoris but doesn&#x27;t have
enough to do. Willem Dafoe (acting using CGI/Motion Capture) is always
great and it is no different here as the Jeddak, Tars Tarkas (&#x22;Jeddak&#x22;
means king), who is having trouble suppressing his compassion in a
barbaric society that doesn&#x27;t allow emotion. While the villains are
uninteresting, they are still played reasonably well by Mark Strong
(who is now typecast in the arrogant &#x22;bad-guy&#x22; role) and Dominic West.<br /><br />By far the best thing about this film is the visuals. This film is
absolutely epic in scope while featuring phenomenal CGI with some great
cinematography that captures the beautiful landscape of &#x22;Barsoom.&#x22; The
aforementioned battle sequence with the &#x22;Warhoon&#x22; is among the best
action scenes I&#x27;ve seen in a long time, in fact, it&#x27;s one of my
all-around favorite parts of any movie I&#x27;ve seen over the past few
years. There is also the thrilling action scene that was heavily
exploited in the promotion of the film, the &#x22;Great White Ape&#x22; sequence.
This sequence ends with a surprisingly gory and just plain awesome
moment that left me with a huge smile on my face. <br /><br />In terms of motion capture, the film is brilliant. The Tharks ended up
being some of my favorite characters in the movie and they were done
entirely with the technology. I actually found that almost all the
scenes with the Tharks were easily the most entertaining sections of
the film, and the scenes with the human-like characters were by far the
most boring.<br /><br />What&#x27;s funny is that the most compelling and entertaining character is
one who has no dialogue; it&#x27;s Woola, the alien-dog I mentioned above.
His extreme loyalty to John Carter, his playfulness, and his ability to
run 250 miles per hour, make him hilarious and actually pretty awesome
when he gets into battle.<br /><br />Michael Giacchino is one of the best composers working today and it is
no surprise that he created an absolutely wonderful musical score for
this movie. It just feels so adventurous and sweeping. It was hard for
me to stop humming the main theme after walking out of the theater.<br /><br />I also loved the ending of this film. It is really unique and unravels
in an unexpected way that is interesting and left me wanting a little
more.<br /><br />Even though I was disappointed by John Carter, I still enjoyed it and
will definitely see it again. It was a movie that had some great
visuals, with decent characters and humor, but is weighed down heavily
by cheesy dialogue, uninteresting villains and a boring plot.
