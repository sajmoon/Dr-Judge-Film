This is a very solid sci-fi pulp send-up that will frustrate many of
today&#x27;s techies and haters who expect Star Trek gadgetry and observe
Star Wars as the holy grail and word of all thing sci-fi. For those of
us who grew up reading Elrich, Heinlein, Clarke, ERB among others, and
watched westerns and Flash Gordon-type shows, it&#x27;s a real treat because
it hearkens back to an era when sci-fi and fantasy was intertwined.<br /><br />The special effects are just about right, not overtly trying to outdo
Avatar but unique in their own right. It&#x27;s also good that the actors
are no-names so it doesn&#x27;t distract from the story.<br /><br />Go see it, enjoy, and hope for many sequels!
