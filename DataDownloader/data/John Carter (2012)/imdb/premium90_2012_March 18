After reading so many reviews and how many have said that the film was
rubbish. It took a while for me to go with my partner to watch this.
After reading that this film was not filmed in 3d, I decided to watch
the 2D version.<br /><br />I am very glad I did! This film is a classic Disney film and is very
good to watch. The only thing I would say is that the first 30 minutes
kind of dragged on a bit.<br /><br />Lynn Collins was very sexy in this film and with blue eye contact
lenses. As for the girls, Taylor Kitsch has a superb physique and 8
pack.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to go into the movie too much as you probably have read
every story in the book online.<br /><br />Watch the 2d version. The film is great and is definitely worth
watching.<br /><br />The only thing I would say to the producers out there. If the film is
made in 3d, sell it as 3d. If it is 2d, keep it as 2d! Over and out!
Captain.
