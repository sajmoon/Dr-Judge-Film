Let me start by saying, I am probably not the target audience for this
film, being a 40 something mum who hasn&#x27;t seen and has no interest in
seeing Avatar or any of the Lord of the Rings films.<br /><br />But I loved this film. It felt like it had more depth and more of a
story telling arc than is usual for action adventure films in my
experience.<br /><br />John Carter is a likable hero and Taylor Kitsch is a really great
choice in the role, he seems to portray the pain in his life in a very
believable way. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that he&#x27;s really easy on the eye,
lol.<br /><br />But all the actors seem right for their roles, Lynne Collins is really
good as the feisty, intelligent heroine, Mark Strong is always solid as
the baddie and Dominic West is really good as the megalomaniac wanting
to rule Mars.<br /><br />This film was so good for me because it was just not a bunch of action
sequences flimsily held together by a bit of a plot, but actually took
the time and the patience to tell a story. The 3D also wasn&#x27;t just a
load of things flying out of the screen to make you jump, it just gave
the film more of a depth.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re not the usual action/adventure geek, go and see this film,
you&#x27;ll be in for a really pleasant surprise. Hubby, 12 year old and I
all enjoyed it a lot.
