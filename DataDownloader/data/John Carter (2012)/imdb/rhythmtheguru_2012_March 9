What was this movie after all? Seriously speaking computer graphics and
fancy sets alone do not make a movie GREAT. The most important thing
for a move is the SCRIPT. And honestly speaking the movie lacked it.<br /><br />Also you will see many things repetitive i.e. the same old Good V/s
Evil plot, brotherhood etc etc but all depicted in a bad unorganized
way.<br /><br />Also if you have the option to see the movie in 2D the better do so and
do not waste your money on 3D.<br /><br />In a nut shell Ratings = 2/10..<br /><br />If possible just avoid it..
