2012_March 19 
I am not going to go through the plot of the film to summarize it, nor
am I going to whine about the ways the film departed from Edgar Rice
Burroughs&#x27; original series. Lots (250 or so) of other reviewers have
given their opinions, pro-film or anti-film, already. I am writing
merely to add my voice to the pro-film lobby. Here&#x27;s why: I found the
story and the details providing back stories to be compelling and
enjoyable. I was thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the film,
despite it being over the two-hour mark. In fact, I would go so far as
to say that I would have added another ten minutes to the film to
parallel the books more perfectly, but as it was, it held my attention
and entertained me very much.<br /><br />I was pleased with both of the &#x22;unknown&#x22; lead actors&#x27;
performances--Taylor Kitsch turned in a nuanced performance as a rather
stoic civil war veteran who finds himself on Mars amid conflict (most
of the civil war vets that I have known have been rather stoic, after
all). His character blooms as the plot progresses and he falls in love
with the beautiful, feisty, Lynn Collins. Reviewers who found their
performances &#x22;wooden&#x22; have either not read the books or were just
expecting the giant characters in their heads from childhood reading of
Burroughs&#x27; books to play out on the screen.<br /><br />What I was most pleased with, aside from the great story well acted,
was the flawless incorporation of CGI green martians, Woolah, etc.
Movies that rely on CGI often distract me, sometimes with jerkiness,
etc. John Carter is a fantastic CGI experience--It was easy for me to
suspend my disbelief and melt into the action and story of the film
without being aware of the animation (full disclosure: I found even
Avatar&#x27;s CGI to be more distracting. Perhaps I am just fully used to
it, or perhaps Pixar just does it better).<br /><br />John Carter left me wanting a sequel. I gave it nine of ten stars
because it did just what it promised, carrying me away from reality to
Mars on a Sunday afternoon, and I reserve 10 for life-changers.
