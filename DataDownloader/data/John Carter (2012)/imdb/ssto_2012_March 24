i admit, i was pleasantly surprised with John Carter. after a few
comics-turned-into-movies big budget failures (let&#x27;s not forget
&#x27;transformers&#x27; either) i expected another crappy
trailer-is-better-than-the-movie style of computer generated garbage.<br /><br />instead John Carter turned out to be a Story, supported with nice cast
(both CGI and live actors). you can find everything in this movie -
sci-fi elements, conspiracy, royal intrigue, love (or should i put it
more hypocrytically as &#x27;romance&#x27;? no), idealists and rogues, aliens and
super powers, loss and treasures<br /><br />all this mixed in a beautiful way with stunning visuals<br /><br />i read here that the movie was based on a book, so i guess this is what
gives the depth of the story which eluded so many recent comics-based
and Greek-mythology derived crap.<br /><br />i have questions about some story elements, but with the overall good
feeling that this movie delivered, i am willing to put these aside and
just enjoy the movie. definitely want to and will watch it again
