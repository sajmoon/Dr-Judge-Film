A lot of people have continued to critique this film by saying it
wasn&#x27;t done well and this or that. The film is nothing of the sort. It
was nothing short of amazing. Though the acting was a little tough at
the beginning it slowly cascades into an adventure that draws the
viewer right into the plot. The action was incredible and mixed great
with the special effects of the Martian World; which was created on key
to the expectations of a dry planet. This is the type of film where a
low-key actor such as Kitsch shines and shows the audience a firm
acting job. Having a big named actor could have easily ruined this
film. Also, Disney has been disappointing me for years now with book to
movie remakes such as the Chronicles of Narnia but this film blew me
away. I mean blew me away. Overall, ignore the critics and go see this
film for yourself. You will definitely not regret it.
