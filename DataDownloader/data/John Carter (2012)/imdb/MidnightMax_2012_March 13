At the Theater- John Carter - I loved it. It&#x27;s a bit corny here and
there but has enough soaring action, crystal clear spectacle and
subtle, &#x22;little&#x22; touches to firmly separate it from the cold,
emotionless Star Wars prequels. The movie rarely feels bloated- It&#x27;s
one of the best constructed and filmed, massive-budgeted, SFX-heavy
releases I&#x27;ve seen in quite some time. Hell, I enjoyed it much more
than Avatar. Needless to say, I was immensely entertained.<br /><br />Writer/Director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, Wall-E, A Bug&#x27;s Life,
Monster&#x27;s Inc.) makes his live-action debut a memorable one, visually
speaking- location footage in New Mexico and Utah (often subbing for
the surfaces of Mars) is absolutely beautiful. It was thrilling to see
such a CGI-heavy film mixing natural scenery in with the manufactured
shots- much like the excellent New Zealand location footage used in the
Lord Of The Rings films established a spacious, tangible setting, it
gives the proceedings a solid, authentic foundation.<br /><br />Based upon Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s &#x22;Princess Of Mars&#x22;, the film feels
like a nostalgic throwback to yesteryear in it&#x27;s tone- expect an
adventurous, stranger-in-a-strange-land story along the lines of
Stargate or, oddly enough, Hidalgo. For a moment or two, I felt like a
younger person...<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch surprised me as the titular character- he&#x27;s often likable
and has presence to spare. This seems to be his year as he&#x27;s the lead
of the upcoming Battleship. That said, the standout of this film is the
beauty of Texas-born Lynn Collins- I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off of
her... the film should have stuck with the Burrough&#x27;s-given story title
of &#x22;Princess Of Mars&#x22;. Perhaps that would have helped with the film&#x27;s
marketing, which was abysmal. Actors portraying humanoid characters
that you may notice: Ciaran Hinds, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Bryan
Cranston and James Purefoy. Featuring the voices of Willem Dafoe,
Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker as non-humanoid
characters. Oh yeah, and there&#x27;s a damned-cool dog-thing that really
grows on you.<br /><br />Complaints: the film opens a bit clunky, the dialogue could have used a
few tweaks and the film needed a stronger central villain.<br /><br />If you have even the least bit of interest, by all means see it in a
quality theater- I highly recommend it. Cynics need not apply.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10
