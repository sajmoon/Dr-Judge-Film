There have only been a few movies that leave me speechless and at the
same time with so much to say... Along with the movie &#x22;The Illusionist&#x22;
stands the ultra-amazing-must see movie &#x22;John Carter&#x22; &#xA0;if you love Star
Wars, Avatar, Lord of the Rings, and all these amazing and entertaining
Sci-fi/Fantasy stories... You will love John Carter. The original
story, the sets, the costumes !!!! The acting and the special
effects!!!! This movie is perfection.... I loved it..... From one
HUMONGOUS Sci-fi fan to another ... Watch JOHN CARTER !!!!! ;)<br /><br />P.s. ignore the negative reviews, these people are ignorant and don&#x27;t
know quality movie magic when they see it, TRUST ME.... It&#x27;s
amazing.... This movie has made my top 10 list...
