John Carter is about 100 years old. The creation of writer Edgar Rice
Burroughs, he predates even Tarzan, another Burroughs&#x27; creation, and is
set in the planet of Mars, or Barsoom in Burroughs-speak in what would
feature an early planetary romance, complete with fantasy, swords and
sorcery. At least that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on the plate in the series of books
that helped inspire countless of other writers and other sci-fi fantasy
stories both in print, and film. So in essence there isn&#x27;t much that
would surprise you in the original source material that featured
Burrough&#x27;s fictional self as well (played by Daryl Sabara), and Andrew
Stanton&#x27;s adaptation is fairly lacklustre from plot to action sequence,
that a wave of familiarity will sweep your consciousness as you try to
tune into the strange civilizations thrust upon you.<br /><br />Predominantly based on the book &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22;, the narrative
adapted by Andrew Stanton, Mark Andrews and even Michael Chabon failed
to ignite that sense of swashbuckling adventure involving a Confederate
veteran of the American Civil War, our titular hero John Carter (Taylor
Kitsch), who found himself inexplicably transported to Mars when out
and about his second career of gold prospecting in Virginia. Throw in
what you will from Dances with Wolves to Avatar involving being that
proverbial fish out of water, and you get what the first hour is all
about. Picked up by green skinned Martians with six limbs known as the
Tharks, John is enslaved to fight for the Tharks given his super-human
abilities scientifically blessed upon him due to Mar&#x27;s lesser gravity,
and soon rises to become one of their folk heroes, christened Dotar
Sojat.<br /><br />But that&#x27;s not before getting himself tripped up in the civil war
between the red skinned humanoid Martians from Helium and Zodanga, and
falling in love with the scantily clad princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn
Collins) who&#x27;s forced into marriage by her father to their enemies in
order to see a truce. With their flying machines and intra-planetary
chase, you&#x27;d wonder where George Lucas would have gotten his
inspiration for the opening of A New Hope, or vice versa in how these
characters got introduced. And when one gets embroiled in someone
else&#x27;s war, what more developing the hots for a princess who holds the
key to one&#x27;s return home, you know for a fact that trouble will come
knocking in less time the planet orbits around the sun.<br /><br />Andrew Stanton, whose previous films were the Pixar animated features
Finding Nemo and Wall.E, may be inspired by fellow colleague Brad
Bird&#x27;s successful live action venture with Mission Impossible: Ghost
Protocol, and embarked on his own franchise-potential with this live
action effort. However, it&#x27;s a whole new different ball game that
Stanton got himself into, and will find that pacing is so key to a
film, given the huge sag in the middle, unable to keep consistent pace
to what had already been set up. John Carter gets everywhere and
couldn&#x27;t decide many times whether to play it straight, or comical. It
couldn&#x27;t decide whether to focus on the drama, or become that special
effects extravaganza, resulting in an effects film that didn&#x27;t have
anything to wow, and at best was derivative. <br /><br />Worse of all, John Carter didn&#x27;t have direction. Objectives were
scattered - one minute he&#x27;s dead set on wanting to go home, while the
next got persuaded in less than convincing terms to stay and interfere
with the inhabitants livelihood. Here the story goes all The Adjustment
Bureau in having what could be their predecessor Watchmen type headed
by Matai Shang played by Mark Strong (surely his contract must have
stated he must be in all blockbuster franchise potential as the key
villain; he&#x27;s so overused that he&#x27;s getting stereotypically boring
already) being that almighty Deux Ex Machina ensuring Fate gets played
out like it should. And to try and force in a little romantic interlude
with a backstory from Earth, didn&#x27;t make the story any more emotionally
appealing.<br /><br />The action sequences also couldn&#x27;t have been any more less interesting.
Sure, John Carter exhibits space age Tarzan capabilities without the
need of a vine, and has the charisma to charm all native inhabitants to
be king of the Mars jungle, but alas there&#x27;s nothing that will put you
at the edge of your seat. Perhaps it&#x27;s that century old tale that got
ripped by many others already, that the filmmakers fell into the
been-there-done-that pit trap and failed to ignite the big screen with
originality. From space battles to Prince of Persia type battles, this
film could have benefited from more creativity, especially with an
ensemble cast assembled with the likes of Willem Dafoe, Samantha
Morton, Thomas Haden Church, Ciaran Hinds, Domic West, Bryan Cranston,
and the list goes on.<br /><br />What saved the movie instead was Edgar Rice Burroughs the writer and
creator himself, given the literary device that he had used to tell the
story. This device of having the novelized Burroughs possessing the
manuscript passed onto him by John Carter, was the only saving grace of
the film, giving it a thrilling finale that thankfully the filmmakers
decided to keep, without which it will lack a crescendo and fall flat
on its face. It&#x27;s certainly primed for a franchise given the wealth of
stories from the source material, but unless it promises a much better
effort put in for subsequent films, John Carter will join the ranks of
many literary fantasy translations for the big screens and fail to lift
off.
