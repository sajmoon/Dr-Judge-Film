I went to see John Carter with my boys (9 and 12) and they loved it as
did I. A cool story spread out over time and space from the old west to
Mars. The story was pretty good with some surprising twists. There
could&#x27;ve been some improvements in the casting of John Carter but
overall good stuff! The special effect and creatures were really cool
and there was plenty of action.<br /><br />The creatures in John Carter were also well thought out and often very
funny. All in all a great ride and certainly worth seeing more than
once.<br /><br />John Carter deserves to become a success, it certainly stands out!
