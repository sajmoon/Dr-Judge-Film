This is mean to be a sort of TARZAN GOES TO MARS, but despite the $250
million budget, the film goes flat from time to time. The CGI sets,
Martian cities and palaces and landscapes, are stunning - almost up
there with LORD OF THE RINGS - but the script keeps stopping to give us
heavy chunks of exposition.<br /><br />The battle and chase scenes, when they come, are as thrilling as in any
other space opera. It&#x27;s the inbetween stuff that is yawn-inducing. The
hero, Taylor Kitsch, comes with designer muscles and artfully
dishevelled hair but he lacks the charisma that Jake Gyllenhaal (or
even Arnold Schwarzeneggar, a few years back) could have brought to the
role. Lynn Collins makes a feisty princess, perhaps a tad too
sophisticated for our Rent-A-Hunk hero.<br /><br />FLASH GORDON meets CLASH OF THE TITANS. Quite a jolly mixture but the
blender needed to be on a higher speed.
