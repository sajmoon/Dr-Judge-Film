This movie is fantastic. If this first movie of a great series, the
mythology is implied lightly, but beautifully. The characters are
likable. The scenery is natural. The aliens are enjoyable. The villains
are rational, but not reasonable; immortal, but not invulnerable.<br /><br />There are of course some flubs in the dialogue. Most notably that the
native martians have their own names of the planets in the solar system
(which makes sense) but one of the central cities in the plot is known
as Helium and one alien makes a reference to Hell (which makes less
sense).<br /><br />One thing I wish they could have gone into greater detail on was the
beginning of the war between the red and the blue. I&#x27;m certain it has
metaphoric parallels to the American Civil War - especially considering
the hero in question was a captain in the Confederate Army.<br /><br />Regardless, its incredible fun. Go see it. Go see it twice.
