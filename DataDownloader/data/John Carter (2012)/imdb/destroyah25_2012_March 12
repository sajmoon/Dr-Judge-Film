John Carter is a fun fast paced film that all can enjoy. The movie
first is filled with great special effects and excellent cgi. It has
some pretty good action sequences also, which I feel in a few parts
could&#x27;ve have been a little longer but still good. One of my favorite
parts of the movie though is the humor it is not something I went in
expecting, but there is a good amount of classy slapstick comedy that
gives a good laugh. Where the movie slips is in the plot element. I
went in just to watch a feel good movie which I got but the plot felt
very fast paced and choppy in parts it goes through quite a few moments
of wait why are they showing this or how is this important. The acting
in a few scenes is very drab as well. Overall though I enjoyed the
movie and felt like I had just got done watching a pirates of the
Caribbean type film, and not to mention its a solid watch for the whole
family 7/10.
