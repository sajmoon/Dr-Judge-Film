This is a film adaptation of a science fiction novel written by Edgar
Rice Burroughs a hundred years ago. Was it worth the wait? Well, it has
enabled state of the art special effects to be deployed in a movie
estimated to cost some $250 million to produce and the creatures and
features on display are impressive. I saw the work in 3D on an IMAX
screen and, while I certainly felt part of the action, I can&#x27;t say that
the 3D added much most of the time.<br /><br />Canadian Taylor Kitsch plays the eponymous former Confederate soldier
who suddenly finds himself transported to Mars - or, as the locals call
it, Barsoom. In his previous film &#x22;The Bang Bang Club&#x22;, Kitsch
portrayed another character called Carter with long hair and a beard so
maybe he just walked off one set and into another, although in this
role he has extraordinary powers of jumping. Some of his co-stars -
notably Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton - are unrecognisable since
they play CGI-created aliens, while many of the others - such as Mark
Strong, Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds, Dominic West and James Purefoy - are stalwarts of
British cinema and television.<br /><br />There are three tribes on Mars: citizens of warring Zodanga and Helium,
who inexplicably look just like humans, and the exceptionally tall,
thin, green, four-armed Tharks who look like cousins of Jar Jar Binks
from the &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; series (indeed so much of &#x22;John Carter&#x22; is
derivative of &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;, although defenders of the film will point
that that the Burroughs novel long preceded the George Lucas movies). A
fair bit of the time, I had no clear idea what these characters were up
to and why but the whole thing was a visual treat that does not bear
any serious analysis.
