John Carter is looking as if it will be another overblown mess of a
movie. The budget was outrageous and somebody at Disney will probably
lose their job over this. The characters were all shallow with no real
substance and for a movie that cost 250 million to make, I wonder where
all the money went because the special effects weren&#x27;t that great
either.<br /><br />The story follows confederate soldier John Carter who finds a cave of
gold and something else unexpected. It is a medallion which transports
him from Earth to Mars where he faces off against many monstrous
creatures and discovers a princess who&#x27;s kingdom needs saving. Since he
is from earth where gravity is stronger than that of Mars, he is able
to leap very high and very far and is also endowed with superhuman
strength which works on occasion, that being when it is only necessary
for the plot.<br /><br />I could not get in to this story and I could not get into the
characters. THis was a dull boring movie. It may not be the worse film
I&#x27;ve ever seen, but I expect more from Disney. THis was worse than the
last Pirates of The Carribbean movie, and that&#x27;s saying something. Not
recommended.
