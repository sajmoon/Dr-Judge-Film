Since &#x22;Ben Hur (1959)&#x22; got the historical horse racing scene and the
&#x22;Spartacus (1960)&#x22; got the gladiator fight-to-death dueling scene,
almost all the movies involved in such similar genre would adapt those
scenes or scenarios from these two modeling movies, from &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; to
&#x22;Gladiator&#x22;, no matter how much the modern day CGI graphic technique
would be implemented, it&#x27;s always like an old bottle filled with new
wine, the tastes or the color might change a lot, but still, they were
borrowed from these two classic movies. But &#x22;John Carter&#x22;, a production
cost over $2.5 billions, the creation was so pathetically thin and
shallow, it shamelessly copied and so directly from so many storyline,
plots, scenes, characters from the &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;. It&#x27;s the laziest and
most shameless copycatting product I&#x27;ve ever seen. Even the Princess on
Mars was a copy directly stolen from &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;. I don&#x27;t care how old
the original dime novel series, but there&#x27;s absolutely no new creation
but old re-creation of the &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;, even the hero John Carter was a
borrowed character from Hansolo(?), an unwilling and accidental
passersby who fatally got involved in somebody else&#x27;s war. the movie
title &#x22;John Carter&#x22; could even be retitled as &#x22;Prequel of Star Wars:
Everything Started from Mars Before Wars Fought in the Galaxy&#x22;. We
didn&#x27;t see anything new that was created solely and independently in
this &#x22;John Carter&#x22; movie. And just because it was so shamelessly
borrowed almost everything from other great movies, and also so blindly
spent so much money to copy &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;, there&#x27;s no way this movie
would be turned out to be NOT FUN, and it&#x27;s a &#x22;Walter Disney&#x22;
production.<br /><br />So, it&#x27;s pretty watchable and it&#x27;s pretty fun too, but there&#x27;s always a
sticky, stinking, goofy and sneaky unavoidable been-fooled feeling of
&#x22;copycatting similarity&#x22;, just like the Chinese copycatting those
famous brand consumer products, look exactly the same but not genuine
at all.
