I cannot believe the reviews that this movie is getting. I will admit I
did not know the existence of the John Carter of Mars or the Barsoom
Series by Burroughs. <br /><br />Honestly I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this epic adventure and
truly original story until I saw the first trailer for the movie and
began researching Burroughs. I have to say I am now a big fan
especially since watching the movie and I plan on getting all the
volumes of the Barsoom series and reading them asap.<br /><br />I would consider my self an avid movie goer and definitely a Sci-fi
fan, with that in mind I can see only little validation with what some
critics are saying. But anyone who criticizes this movie for ripping
off or deriving its story from other movies such as Star Wars, Avatar
or even Star Trek needs to check their facts and actually do a little
research to plainly see that George Lucas, James Cameron and even Gene
Roddenberry were the ones who were influenced BY Burroughs&#x27; truly
original tales which he began writing in 1912! <br /><br />Anyway I hope and believe that John Carter will pick up in popularity
while its still in theaters and will become a dearly loved franchise
that will have its own place on the per-verbal shelf next to Star Wars
and Avatar.
