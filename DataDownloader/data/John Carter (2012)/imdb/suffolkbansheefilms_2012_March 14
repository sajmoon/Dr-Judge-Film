A delirious slice of pulp fantasy channelling the wide-eyed innocence
and schoolboy excitement of the original Star Wars Trilogy, John Carter
is a madcap space opera, beautifully scored and cunningly wrought, with
a real sense of wonder often missing in more cynical blockbuster fare.
Taylor Kitsch steps neatly into the leading role with enough gravelly
self-deprecation to evoke the spirit of Han Solo, Superman and even
Conan the Barbarian, playing a character that pre-dated and heavily
influenced all three, and the delightful, impossibly gorgeous Lynn
Collins is wonderful as Dejah Thoris, the fabled princess of Mars of
Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; imaginings with a modern twist, not so much
damsel in distress as feisty Jedi Knight. It&#x27;s a role she was born to
play, and I can&#x27;t be alone in thinking that an even slightly younger
actor would not have brought enough gravitas and appeal to a role which
could have been reduced to simpering eye-candy in the wrong hands;
Collins plays it perfectly, and so capably demonstrates what a
thirysomething actor has to offer that a twentysomething actor simply
could not do. The pair have genuine chemistry, sometimes in spite of
the occasional preposterous line (thankfully &#x22;ninth ray isolates&#x22;
feature far less heavily than, say, The Phantom Menace&#x27;s
&#x22;midichlorians&#x22;, argh!), and director Andrew Stanton shows the same
deft mix of thoughtful romance and frantic action he previously
displayed in Wall-E; some of John Carter&#x27;s strongest moments come where
pulp scifi fun is laid to one side for a moment, and the wonderful
score by Michael Giacchino, not to mention Lynn Collins&#x27; hypnotic blue
eyes, are allowed to do the talking.<br /><br />A fine stable of classically trained actors &#x96; playing four-armed,
hulking green aliens, Martian Kings and Generals, and mysterious,
scheming demigods &#x96; provide excellent support. Ciaran Hinds and James
Purefoy, formerly Caesar and Mark Antony in HBO&#x27;s excellent &#x22;Rome&#x22;,
stand out as the leaders of a warring Martian state of Helium, bringing
a lot of charisma to only a few moments of screen time. And Samantha
Morton and Willem Dafoe are exceptional as John Carter&#x27;s Thark allies,
playing motion-captured aliens with so much heart and presence, you&#x27;ll
suspend your disbelief instantly. The Wire&#x27;s Dominic West, though
criminally underused, is sufficiently charming and smarming as the
villainous Zodangan general. Even the CGI dog is charming. The weakest
link is Mark Strong, playing one of John Carter&#x27;s supervillanous
Thurns, who just manages to avoid phoning it in; it&#x27;s a role you&#x27;ve
seen him play many times before.<br /><br />8/10. I haven&#x27;t scored this any higher because it&#x27;s a truly,
wonderfully ridiculous film, and for that reason alone it won&#x27;t be to
everyone&#x27;s taste. Corn-fed viewers raised on the Saw Films, the X
Factor and a recent spate of terrible superhero fodder (Green
Lantern??) may not appreciate John Carter&#x27;s classic pedigree. But for
anyone who ever loved pulp Saturday Matinees, 80&#x27;s scifi, HP Lovecraft,
Robert E Howard, Lando Calrissian, Indiana Jones or that roar Chewbacca
makes (Star Wars was ridiculous in its day, too) then you&#x27;ll love this.
Absolutely marvellous. I hope American Audiences this coming weekend
are persuaded by the stunning success of John Carter overseas, because
I can&#x27;t wait for the sequel.
