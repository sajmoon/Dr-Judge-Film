Beautiful to look at and often thrilling, but bogged down by weak
central characters. <br /><br />The movie begins and ends well, but the action on Mars suffers from
poorly defined characters. I found myself continuously wondering what
was motivating John Carter to act as he did. Some of this was answered
as back story flashbacks, but it was not sufficient. Ultimately, his
character came across as one dimensional and uninteresting. And the
love story was likewise flat and not believable. The primary villain
looked confusingly similar to his top generals and none of them were
overly interesting as bad guys. <br /><br />The movie&#x27;s premise was great, but the plot suffered as it was never
made clear why I should root for one side or the other. What was at
stake? Why should we care?<br /><br />Taken as a whole, I left the theater feeling entertained but with a
nagging sense that this movie was a couple rewrites away from being
great.
