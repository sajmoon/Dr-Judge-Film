2012_March 30 
After reading the series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs (and would
totally recommend them to anyone, especially the first three books), I
was really looking forward to seeing this. The fact that at the helm is
a director that actually knows how to tell a story put it in good
stead. Even though the trailers do come across as a Star Wars/Avatar
clone (and there&#x27;s much more to the film than just the all-action
sequences), and people are already lazily writing it off as such, but
as the original book &#x27;A Princess Of Mars&#x27; was first published 100 years
ago, you can see after reading the book that George Lucas, James
Cameron were definitely &#x27;inspired&#x27; and mined the books for ideas
(they&#x27;ve even said so in interviews themselves).<br /><br />Well, that day has at last arrived! John Carter is finally on the big
screen, and I have to say, I loved it! From when we first see Barsoom
and the aerial battle of the Zodangan and Heliumite airships, it really
reminded me of the old swashbuckling movies I used to love and overall,
director Andrew Stanton seems to have recaptured that old pulp action
adventure spirit of the books. Yes, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a true
book-to-film adaptation, things were missing or changed from the book,
but then again, it&#x27;s always to be expected. Not everything will
translate well from the page and your imagination to screen, not
forgetting that the original source material is 100 years old too.<br /><br />I thought the leads played their parts pretty well, Taylor Kitsch did
his job as Carter, and I was very impressed with Lynn Collins&#x27; Dejah
Thoris (I think I&#x27;m in love!) and James Purefoy&#x27;s Kantos Kan, even if
his role was pretty brief! And Mark Strong, well, he&#x27;s Mark Strong
playing a bad guy, awesome as ever. I also liked the way the movie was
bookended with the Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) scenes.<br /><br />I really do hope we get to see the next film - &#x27;The Gods Of Mars&#x27;.
Forget the terrible (non-existent?) promotion and the slating from
critics that just didn&#x27;t get the premise of the film, it&#x27;s so much
better than it looks. Reviews that have been posted across the web have
been very favourable about the film! So if you like a good old fun
swashbuckling pulp action adventure, like the Sinbad films of old (or
even the original Jason &#x26; The Argonauts or Raiders Of The Lost Ark
perhaps), you should give this a watch! Recommended!
