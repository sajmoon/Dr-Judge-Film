This mix of movies is BAD, really bad! I&#x27;m not sure who their market
was but it was not anyone I know.<br /><br />Was is action???? If so it was lacking action. There were 5 minute
bursts of action spaced too far apart in the story line for anyone to
call it an action movie. The director and writers have clearly never
heard the phrase &#x22;Action Packed&#x22;.<br /><br />Was it romance???? If so the &#x22;no, no, no, no, suddenly yes&#x22; was clearly
written by a man thinking he knows romance and failing. If the romance
was hap-hazardly poked into the movie to make women swoon then they
clearly don&#x27;t understand women. Who wants to be second best to a
corpse? Not me. <br /><br />If it was fantasy / adventure???? Then for Gods sake buy some
originality! It seems like this is the lite version of 100 different
movies I&#x27;ve seen cut and paste together.<br /><br />There was no moral story at the end! What was the point???? Not that a
movie has to have a &#x22;Moral to the story&#x22; but in this case it would have
at least been something to hang your hat on before you leave the &#x22;now
not surprisingly&#x22; empty theater.<br /><br />FAIL
