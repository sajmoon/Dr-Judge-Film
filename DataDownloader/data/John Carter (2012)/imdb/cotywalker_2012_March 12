This movie is far from a flop like people are reporting. My brother and
I took our 11 and 10 year old to see and we all four loved the movie.<br /><br />Taylor did a great job as John Carter Lynn Collins looked AMAZING. The
special effects were great. We watched it in 2D and we all loved the
movie and I found it out so many were hating on this movie. I want a
sequel since there are more books based on John Carter!!!! <br /><br />It had subtle comic hints in it, great characters and the story was
fantastic of course. <br /><br />A movie I would watch again and buy on DVD when it comes out.<br /><br />Loved the movie and hope people go to see it in bunches because it is
the first of MANY GREAT MOVIES ON THE SLATE THIS SPRING AND SUMMER!!!
