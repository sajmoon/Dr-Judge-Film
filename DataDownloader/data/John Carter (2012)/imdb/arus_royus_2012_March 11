I&#x27;ve read a lot of comments that this movie should be avoided because
it is a Disney movie....... To me who made a movie is not a view
criterion. What matters is how entertaining/illuminating/ etc. etc. a
movie is and not my bias against the producers. And as far as I can
tell, in my humble opinion, John Carter is highly entertaining,
beautiful to watch, fantastic landscapes, great action, decent acting
and a touch of menace, not to mention a gorgeous princess. <br /><br />Also the 3D effects where magnificent. I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to Avatar
or Star Wars, since all are great in their own right, even though both
have been greatly inspired by it.<br /><br />Besides that everything else has already been said about this movie
(that the is story based on (rather closely) &#x22;Princess of Mars&#x22; which
is the All-Father of modern Sci Fi adventures written over 100 years
ago by Edgar Rice Burroghs).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to all adventure and action fans and
wider audiences.
