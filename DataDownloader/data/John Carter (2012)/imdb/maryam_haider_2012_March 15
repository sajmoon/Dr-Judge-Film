Amazing movie, definitely worth watching not once but many times! <br /><br />I don&#x27;t think people do justice comparing it to films like Spiderman,
in its uniqueness the only one i can compare to might be avatar
although i think its better that Avatar! <br /><br />Simple,uncomplicated story, although there were twists, fantastic
cinematography. Acting was also superb. I felt like a child transported
to another world, Mars, a place i have always fatasized about. The
story and location were so believable and realistic that i forgot all
my troubles sitting in the cinema with my mouth open watching this
film. This is one movie you will want to watch again and again.
