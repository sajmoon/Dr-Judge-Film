It&#x27;s easy to call John Carter a rip off of Superman and Flash Gordon,
but the John Carter books where written in 1912, so Superman and Flash
Grodon probably got inspiration from John Carter if you think about it.<br /><br />John Carter(Taylor Kitsch,Friday Night Lights) a former civil war
veteran, finds himself transported to Mars, because of the atmosphere,
he is able to leap with long distance and is a little bit stronger than
normal. Finds himself caught in a war, and ends up with a runaway
princess(Lynn Collins). Will Carter save her and the planet before it&#x27;s
too late? <br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is not an awful actor, but not great either, but I like
the way he does not play the character has annoyingly one noted. Lynn
Collins is also good has the princess. So are Mark Strong and Dominic
West are great also. The effects are incredible too. And yeah it is
your typical sci-fi adventure film, it at times feels not anything
original, but it was still a fun time at the movies.
