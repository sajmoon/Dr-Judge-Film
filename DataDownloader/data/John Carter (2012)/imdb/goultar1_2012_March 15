This movie quite frankly is the BEST movie I have seen in the past
thirty years. Everything a movie needs to have was there. The special
effects, acting, story line, photography-- you name it, everything was
the best. This movie kept me glued to my seat, and I have actually
thought about the movie many times after I have seen it. Anyone who
does not fall in love with this movie needs to have his head examined.
The actors and actresses, especially the leads, are as good if not
better than any I have ever seen.<br /><br />Did I say that this is a great movie?? I recommend this movie to anyone
who likes science fiction and has anything resembling a brain in his or
her head.
