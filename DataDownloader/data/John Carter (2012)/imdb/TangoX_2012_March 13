I had to vote this 10 out of 10...<br /><br />Just for the reason that, to think these series of books were written
around 100 years ago, this man had visions, what a creative mind. I
have never read the books, however after seeing the film today, I am
going to to buy my copy in the next few days. <br /><br />It is amazing to think that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote such a detailed
account of an amazing SCI FI adventure, really did blow me away.<br /><br />Also have to say this is the first film that I have seen in 3D that
feels like it belongs in 3D, its not forced on you, it feels natural,
like its part of your environment... So far other 3D films have made me
feel like I want to leave, however this made me feel right at home...<br /><br />I gave it 10 out of 10 because this series of books started the SCI FI
series that we know and love today, I hope we get to see the rest of
the series of books made into film soon, as I would love to see the
complete story told...<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next episode!!!<br /><br />One last thing, when you do go watch this, remember it was written over
100 years ago!
