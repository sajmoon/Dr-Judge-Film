I grew up with ER Burrough&#x27;s books, and have seen some truly awful
adaptations of them in film over the years. I&#x27;m very pleased to say
that Disney-Pixar has made a tolerably good job of translating &#x22;A
Princess of Mars&#x22; to the screen. The design elements of the movie are
great: tharks, thoats, other Martian creatures; aerial ships of all
sizes, cities, weapons, costumes, terrain and so on actually equalled
or surpassed my expectations. <br /><br />The characters&#x27; appearance, dialogue and acting, or reacting, were more
than satisfactory. Taylor Kitch (John Carter) has a suitable
athleticism, and an admirable animation of facial features when facing
what was for him, no doubt, a green screen. Lynn Collins (Dejah
Thoris), likewise, was a credit to her character. No mere damsel in
distress, she swings a sword with the best of them. Willem Dafoe&#x27;s
voice for Carter&#x27;s friend, Tars Tarkas, suited the character well as
did all the Thark voices.<br /><br />Then, why did I give only six out of ten to this seemingly wonderful
work? Where Burrough&#x27;s story is a yarn of adventure, romance, battle of
good guys against bad guys, this has metaphysical undertones, and a
nasty group of superior minds, the Therns, with its feet in two worlds,
totally alien (pardon the pun) to his stories. <br /><br />This one addition, unnecessary and uncalled for, carries a great cost
to the overall success of the film. It muddies the straight-line
storytelling that Edgar Rice Burroughs was famous for. It will create
difficulties in presenting the second novel, &#x22;The Gods of Mars&#x22;,
because of the way the Therns have been presented here.
