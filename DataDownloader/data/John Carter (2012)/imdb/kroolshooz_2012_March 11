Others have commented on the qualities of this movie, which is so-so,
but I just have to express my continued resentment at Hollywood for
using the names of literary characters for movies about completely
unrelated characters.<br /><br />The John Carter character in this movie bears little resemblance to the
John Carter of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Why do movie makers do this ALL
THE TIME? If you want to make up your own character - DO IT! Call it
&#x22;Bill Smith of Mars,&#x22; or &#x22;Fred the Barbarian.&#x22; Stop taking great
classic characters like John Carter and Conan and wrecking them! Change
whatever else you need in the plot to make it work as a movie, but at
least - for the love of God - leave the character intact, or what&#x27;s the
point? John Carter was a genuine early 20th-century hero, chivalrous
and honorable to a fault, with no dark, haunted past. They just HAD to
make the movie John Carter into a late 20th-century antihero with a
troubled soul...the kind of guy that would yank a woman off her horse
and make her walk across the desert just to prove his point. Burroughs&#x27;
John Carter would have fallen on his sword before treating a woman like
that, and wouldn&#x27;t have hesitated for one second to defend a good
cause. This old-fashioned honor and chivalry was the ESSENCE of
Burroughs&#x27; John Carter, the gentleman from Virginia.<br /><br />The funny thing about the late 20th-century antihero is that it was a
reaction to the clich&#xE9; of the &#x22;classic&#x22; hero that had been worked to
death, largely in Westerns, up through the 1950s. Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Man
with No Name upended the old stereotypes, and from the early 1960s on,
almost every movie protagonist had to be a dark, brooding, antihero.
The thing is...and listen up movie makers...the DARK BROODING ANTIHERO
IS NOW THE Clich&#xE9;!! It&#x27;s been 50 years now of the same freaking
character in every movie, for God&#x27;s sake. The irony of the John Carter
movie is that if they had made him the old-fashioned hero that he
originally was, with no dark side, no murdered family haunting his
memories, no ambivalent attitude toward society, THAT would have been
breaking the clich&#xE9;! An old-fashioned, chivalrous, Virginia gentleman
on Mars...maybe even with a Virginia accent...would actually have been
a breath of fresh air and would have made the character memorable and
distinctive. Instead, same ol&#x27; same ol&#x27;.
