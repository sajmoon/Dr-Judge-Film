Adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; 1917 fantasy novel A Princess of
Mars, this family friendly Disney production follows the
inter-planetary escapades of 19th century Civil War veteran John Carter
(a solid if unspectacular Taylor Kitsch) as he reluctantly aides
Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) in her quest to save Mars (or Barsoom as
they call it) from the malevolent Therns. Carter&#x27;s source material may
predate Star Wars and Avatar by more than half a century, but it&#x27;s the
influence of those gargantuan sci-fi epics that is most notable on the
screen. The 9-foot tall, green, motion-captured Tharks are subpar
versions of the Na&#x27;vi, whilst the sets and spaceships are very
reminiscent of George Lucas&#x27; creation. It&#x27;s these resemblances that
hinder Carter&#x27;s success &#x96; if you&#x27;re going to be a concoction of sci-fi
classics, you would really want to blow the audiences mind. That said,
Dads and their young sons will have a blast.
