The director of this film obviously has no idea how to direct human
beings because whenever a human was on the screen, the movie would
drag. When the Tharks were on the screen, the fun-level of the film
instantly increased.<br /><br />This is the number one problem with this move. I didn&#x27;t care less about
what happened to John Carter. The guy playing him had no charisma or
screen presence. He was dull as beige. He just had a nice body and
kinda smirked once in awhile, but that&#x27;s about it. The queen wasn&#x27;t
really that much better. The rest of the human cast were as equally
boring.<br /><br />As I was watching, I was also reminded of movies like the early 80s
version of Flash Gordon, and the late 70s version of Buck Rogers.
Perhaps if the director shot for that kind of camp, John Carter could
have been a rip-rousing good time. Instead, we have some great CGI
characters that are upstaging their human counterparts.
