This film is remarkable on so very many levels. Yes, the trailers
suggest modest expectations, but the film sweeps you along from start
to finish. The depth of the characters, and the pathos of their lives,
the brutal but pragmatic and honorable Tharks, the romance between
Carter and Dejah Thoris, the beautiful Keith Thompson style machines,
the steam- punk Victorian ships, and the epic battles all combine to
create a wonderful and sweeping saga. <br /><br />Where Avatar painted in beautiful but broad colors and shock value,
using cartoon bad guys and innocent nature-good guys, leading to
horrible violence and violent vengeance; where Star Wars had camp and
deeply rooted philosophy; John Carter of Mars tells a remarkable and
very human tale of the emergence of a leader and the salvation of two
cultures. I have read reviews trying to compare this film to Avatar and
Star Wars, and you can see elements. But those comparisons are entirely
wrong and misguided. You might as well compare Saturday morning
cartoons with Shakespeare. If you have read the Barsoom series, you see
elements of John Carter in these other tales, but only weakly
reflected. In John Carter you get the full treatment. There is no
holding back. The violence is very very bloody, just like the book.
Today, in today&#x27;s cinema, the story can be told just as Edgar Rice
Burroughs did, without apology, with nobility.<br /><br />The characters are much more finely drawn, especially Tars Tarkas and
Sola. Their story is deeply moving, but so is the romance between
Carter and Thoris. The photography, the scenery and the pacing reflect
the work of David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia. Stanton is truly the heir
to David Lean, and we are very excited to see the films he will be
making in the years ahead.<br /><br />This is the Lawrence of Arabia of fantasy sci-fi, and that is a fair
comparison.<br /><br />John Carter is an instant classic, to be watched over and over again,
enjoyed, discussed and remembered. A true historical landmark in
bringing a mature and wonderful epic human saga into the sci-fi fantasy
genre.
