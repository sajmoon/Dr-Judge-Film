John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs A PRINCESS OF MARS. Having
read the John Carter of Warlord of Mars series as a kid my view of the
movie is that it is almost flawless. The plot is strong the acting is
great and the special effects complete the picture taking us back to
Barsoom. The plot is simple in it&#x27;s nature. Captain John Carter is
trapped in a cave by hostile apaches while there he sees a strange
figure approach him and Carter shoots him the figure drops a medallion
off it&#x27;s hands and Carter picks it up as he does so he finds himself
falling asleep under a mysterious gas. When he awakes he finds himself
on Mars how he got there is mystery but Carter discovers that the
Martian planet has given him strange abilities. He is witnessed using
his powers by Tars Tarkas and his band of Tharks who decide carter
could be used as a weapon of war. Carter has other ideas . And When he
meets Dejoris the Princess of the Title Carter still wants to go home
but Dejoris soon recruits Carter into her cause freeing her city and
Barsoom from ruthless Raiders who want nothing more then the death of
the planet so they can feed off the chaos. While fighting to help free
Mars John Carter discovers his true destiny as John Carter Warlord of
Mars. THe movie moves slow in some parts but the action makes up for
it. There is considerable development and the movie moves for the most
part at a brisk entertaining pace. Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews see it
and decide for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you like tales
of high adventure as they used to be go see it.
