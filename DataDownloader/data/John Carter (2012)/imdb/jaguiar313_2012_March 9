As a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Martian Chronicles, I have been
waiting for someone to adapt these nearly 100 year old pulp sci-fi
adventures to film since I was a boy. Now after years in development
hell, Disney finally brings the adventures of Earthman John Carter to
life. And it&#x27;s a bit of a mixed bag. The simply named &#x22;John Carter&#x22;
takes a lot of liberties with Burroughs&#x27; stories, too many to list here
and in result comes up with a tale that is a bit talky and more plot
heavy then needed. Burroughs&#x27; books were short, action packed and to
the point. So should have John Carter been. But, this story of
Confederate Captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) who is whisked to the
planet Mars were he finds an ally in four-armed, green warrior Tars
Tarkus (voiced by Willem Dafoe) and love with beautiful princess Dejah
Thoris (who has now graduated from the damsel in distress in the books
to also being a scientist and woman warrior played by Lynn Collins) is
not all bad as directed by Andrew Stanton (director of Finding Nemo and
Wall-E). Stanton may have written a lot of dialog scenes but, when
there is action, it is fast moving and exciting and he gets good
performances out of his cast. He does set a good pace for a film with a
lot of plot and he does capture some of the pulp charm nicely in many
scenes as well. It&#x27;s too bad he couldn&#x27;t follow Burroughs lead and keep
John Carter a bit simpler and get to the spectacular action a bit
sooner. I was never bored but, there is a lot of traveling back and
forth before the plot really gets moving and Carter, with his enhanced
abilities due to Mars&#x27; thinner atmosphere and lesser gravity, gets to
the business of saving Mars and his lady love. Yes, plot and character
development are important but, I still feel the film&#x27;s 132 minutes
could have been better managed. Criticisms aside, the film is
sumptuously designed , the SPFX are flawless and there is nice
atmosphere from Michael Giacchino&#x27;s (Star Trek, Super 8) beautiful
score. The enormous budget is on screen and despite it&#x27;s flaws, the end
had me wanting to see more of Carter&#x27;s adventures on Barsoom (their
name for Mars) as there are 11 books and now that the central
characters have all been introduced, we can get right to the fun. And
John Carter wasn&#x27;t without fun, it just need a bit more of it.
