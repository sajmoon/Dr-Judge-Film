I saw director and writer Andrew Stanton at a lecture &#x22;How to Tell
Stories&#x22; he gave in Moscow two days ago (the movie has opened in Russia
yesterday and I just happened to be in town for the premiere). I admire
Andrew for everything he did for Pixar and every word he said at the
lecture felt right... But then I went to see the movie.<br /><br />You guessed right, this is not going to be a positive review. But I
wanted it so badly to be! One of my favorite directors, making a movie
based on a book I tremendously enjoyed as a kid, with a decent budget
for special effects. <br /><br />But the movie sucked. Incoherent predictable clich&#xE9;d melodrama with
stale dialogue, pile up of flashbacks and boring - yes, BORING -
action. I could not believe I am watching the work of creator of &#x22;Bugs
Life&#x22;, &#x22;Finding Nemo&#x22; and &#x22;Wall-E&#x22;! <br /><br />And this is not a rant of a book fan, I don&#x27;t even remember the book.
And not complaint of betrayed high expectations, I didn&#x27;t have much,
based on poster and trailers. But what the heck happened to good
storytelling? Why am I watching bunch of people I don&#x27;t care about and
didn&#x27;t have time to find out about talking about some political
intrigues inside of insanely unrealistic CGI sets. Why am I getting my
own deja vu flashbacks from &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;, &#x22;Cowboys and Aliens&#x22;
and &#x22;Star Track&#x22; (and not in the good sense). How can a girl dressed in
princess- Leia type costume be SO unsexy? How can be guy, leaping over
mountains and crushing hundreds of enemies be SO unexciting? Why do I
have to listen page after page of verbal explanations? <br /><br />Why Andrew? Why? <br /><br />Sincerely, your fan.
