By various accounts, there have been attempts to bring Edgar Rice
Burrough&#x27;s second most well known character, planet hopping John
Carter, to the screen as far back as the 1930s. However, it has taken
until 2012, the centenary of the publication of A Princess of Mars, the
first John Carter tale, for those efforts to finally bear fruit.
Disney&#x27;s John Carter is full of what you would expect from epic pulp
science fiction: multi-limbed, green-skinned aliens, a square jawed
hero and a beautiful woman for him to alternately save and fall in love
with. The problem, however, is all these elements are in service to a
seemingly endless slog through a pastiche of familiar components
without a compelling reason to exist.<br /><br />The film opens with a fast as lightning narration that will possibly
leave the uninitiated scratching their heads as the scene is set: on
the planet of Mars, known as Barsoom to its indigenous inhabitants, the
Zondangans are attempting to strip mine the planet of its resources (I
think). Opposing them are the people of Helium, led by Tardos Mors
(Ciaran Hinds), against the evil Zodangan leader, Sab Than (Dominic
West). However, Sab has formed an alliance with a group of creatures
that the people of Barsoom view as assistance to their great goddess,
Isis, named Therns. The Therns, primarily represented by Matai Shang
(Mark Strong), have given Sab a powerful weapon that he is using to
subdue the people of Helium so that they can engage in a nefarious
plot. Meanwhile, on Earth in the late 1800s, John Carter (Taylor
Kitsch), a former Confederate soldier, is prospecting for Gold in the
Arizona territory when he accidentally encounters a Thern in a cave and
is teleported to Mars, where the difference in gravity and the density
of his body gives him the ability to leap through the air as if the
whole planet was a giant trampoline.<br /><br />Shortly after arriving on Mars, John is captured by Tharks, the
previously mentioned aliens, whose leader, Tars Tarkas (the voice of
Willem Dafoe and some decent computer animation for the visual
appearance), takes a liking to Carter. Through various plot
machinations, John ends up saving the Helium princess Deja Thoris (Lynn
Collins) from the clutches of Sab, who desires to marry her so he can
gain power on Mars. Deja convinces Carter she can get him back to
Earth, but hopes to convince him to take up the cause against the
Zondangans to save Mars.<br /><br />The John Carter of Mars series of books have long been favorites of
authors and filmmakers who would shape science fiction throughout the
20th century, including such luminaries as Ray Bradbury and George
Lucas. Over the years, elements of the John Carter stories have been
cherry picked and utilized in so many other works that, now that the
&#x22;original&#x22; material is finally being adapted, frankly, it manages to
look derivative and old hat. I am aware of the historical significance
of Burrough&#x27;s work, so while I can reconcile the fact that John Carter
feels like it is ripping off other films that actually ripped their
elements off from the John Carter stories, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact
that this film is late to the party compared to so many others, and
looks it. Many familiar elements to modern audiences are on display,
such as a princess in danger, megalomaniacal villains who desire world
domination, alien beings with strong, instilled senses of honor, so on
and so forth. John Carter cannot help the fact it looks like it is
robbing other, better films.<br /><br />Much of this could be forgiven if John Carter was a rousing tale, but
alas, it is not. The film spends an interminable amount of time setting
up its story, introducing characters who prove one-dimensional, and
moving slowly through familiar paces, that it quickly wears out its
welcome. John Carter also unveils its narrative in a rather haphazard
manner, leading to an extensive learning curve for audience members who
are not well versed in the stories on which the film is based. Once the
narrative is going it doesn&#x27;t prove impenetrable, but it also feels as
if big chunks of explanation have ended up on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Carter is given a tragic backstory, and at one point it does provide a
degree of pathos to him, but aside from that, these are people we don&#x27;t
really care about. Carter and Deja are supposed to be smitten for one
another, but there is no legitimate chemistry, just a screenplay
mandated romance. The villains are rather limp as well, with Dominic
West providing his best dastardly villain turn but proving somewhat
cheesy and obvious, and Mark Strong plays his character with very
little energy, not giving the audience someone to root against.<br /><br />Kitsch certainly looks the role as a hero, but the screenplay gives him
little to do that endears John Carter to us. Lynn Collins, with
reddened skin and tattoos, projects a degree of exotic beauty that
makes her a good choice for Deja Thoris, and her character is endowed
with a little more material to work with. Ciaran Hinds is here to look
important and collect a paycheck, James Purefoy is here to provide an
offbeat, playful guard to Deja and collect a paycheck and the most
endearing character proves to be a computer generated, six legged,
fast- as-The-Flash dog creature that you can&#x27;t help but find cute.<br /><br />John Carter has an impressive filmmaking pedigree behind it, including
director Andrew Stanton who previously helmed the Pixar films Finding
Nemo and Wall-E, and award winning novelist Michael Chabon who is an
admitted Burroughs fan. It is unfortunate that such talent serve up
something so lackluster, but John Carter proves an underwhelming affair
that will most likely have audience members shifting in their seats
well before the running time is half over. Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s
character deserves better.
