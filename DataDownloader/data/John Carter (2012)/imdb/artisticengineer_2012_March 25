Edgar Rice Burroughs was the creator of Tarzan- Lord Greystoke who grew
up among the apes yet somehow became an educated and mannered human
being; while still being able to rule his &#x22;tribe&#x22; of apes. Though the
Tarzan stories were adapted for movies the most well known ones did not
show such an erudite side to the character; and these are the stories
that most people know of the authorship of Burroughs. <br /><br />Actually, he wrote a number of novels for another character; John
Carter, gentleman adventurer. And, in these novels this protagonist
literally goes &#x22;out of this world&#x22;! He goes to the planet Mars. A
little bit of history here- in 1877 the noted Italian astronomer
Giovanni Schiaparelli saw, through a telescope, some markings on the
planet Mars that called &#x22;canali&#x22; (in his native Italian) and
conjectured they were water channels. In the early 20th century the
amateur astronomer Percival Lowell mistranslated this term and
concluded the channels were canals instead. Canals are artificial
waterways and constructed by humans. Of course, on Mars somebody other
than humans would have to construct them and the nature of this
&#x22;somebody&#x22; is what Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his John Carter novels
about. <br /><br />Do not get too involved with the plausibility or lack of in this movie.
The nature of Mars was pretty much unknown when Burroughs wrote these
novels. For all anybody knew then, great empires could exist on Mars.
Burroughs wrote these novels when people felt that airships that were
as large as sailing ships would eventually be built and fly at sailing
speeds (i.e. &#x3C;50 knots) instead of the very high speeds that aircraft
actually fly at. Rather instead, view this movie as awe and grandeur as
you are taken from the Wild West that John Carter found himself at and
are transported instantly to a incredibly developed planet that
nonetheless still has good guys, bad guys, heroes, villains, loyal
pets, and a beautiful damsel in distress. What more could one ask from
a movie?!
