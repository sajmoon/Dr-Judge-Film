I just returned from seeing John Carter on Imax 3-D. I rarely write
reviews but this is a must see movie. <br /><br />I compare it to a combination of &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; and &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. Great
special effects! Knowing that much of the film was created in a studio
it still has the epic proportions of a &#x22;Ten Commandments&#x22; <br /><br />I did not read the book(s) so I can not tell you if they follow the
story line accurately. Their are some strong messages and symbolism
however don&#x27;t look for a deep plot. It is&#x27;t that type of movie.<br /><br />I am so amazed at this production that I need to digest it all before I
tell you more...
