2012_March 24 
With a budget of 250 million, I expected this movie to be brilliant.
Well, to say it fell short is to understate it. The acting and the plot
were terrible. Only the visual effects stood out and those didn&#x27;t
matter after appalling story and acting. The fact that it has been a
dump at the box office just says it all. It was boring and seemed
unimaginably fake. One of the worst mistakes the producers of the movie
made was to star no established actor in such a big budget movie. I
felt like leaving in the interval itself but I hoped that it would
become better as the movie progressed. It didn&#x27;t happen. I felt like I
really wasted my money. Should have realized it will be horrible after
I saw the trailer.DO NOT WATCH IT! I BEG YOU TO NOT WATCH IT. and as
for the people who liked it, i bet they haven&#x27;t ever seen a good movie
