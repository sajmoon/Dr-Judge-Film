Full of pop culture references, CGI sleestaks, and adult language, John
Carter provided a new take on the original Sid and Marty Kroft series
from the 1970s. The Dino&#x27;s were fantastic. The actors were great and
the scenery was awesome. I highly recommend watching &#x22;John Carter&#x22;. You
will have a great time! I am not a critic, but I know how to enjoy a
fun movie when I see one. Have fun! Enjoy! Laugh! Be amazed! This movie
rocks!<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is Dr. John Carter , a civil war era vet with a
controversial belief that humans can travel back in time. He gets
laughed out of his regiment. Then, in relative obscurity he enters the
planet Mars at the La Brea Tar Pits.<br /><br />An artifact leads them to a portal at a roadside Desert tourist trap
run by a snakeoil salesman and travelling showman. He is thereupon
plunged into an alternate Mars with dinosaurs and prehistoric primates
like Tars Tarkas. There are also the infamous sleestaks.<br /><br />How could you not love this movie? <br /><br />Unlike most comedies, a lot of attention was paid to the composition of
the shots. Director, Brad Stanton, gives us several nicely composed
shots, just like he did, only to more effect, in A Bug&#x27;s Life (2004).
