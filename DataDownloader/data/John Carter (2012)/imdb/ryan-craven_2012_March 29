Andrew Stanton, fresh from 2 successful and rather good Pixar movies,
makes a comfortable and competent move into live action film making,
with an emotionally resonant thrill ride that is fun, fast and
charming. <br /><br />Granted, there are a few flaws, as there always are with ma-hoo-sive
blockbusters. The opening resembles that of a poorly executed,
slap-dash Sci-Fi TV show, airing on FX, and there could be more romance
establishing scenes between the 2 excellent leads, but once John Carter
becomes of Mars, it becomes something wholly remarkable. <br /><br />Taylor Kitsch has a lot to prove this summer, with this and Battleship,
coming this April, and he doesn&#x27;t disappoint, giving the titular
character gruff charisma, dry humour and gives the film steely and
reliable foundations. Lynn Collins also makes for a convincing and sexy
warrior princess, whilst Mark Strong continues his consistent run as
manipulator/villain routine.<br /><br />Where Stanton really succeeds is in making a fantastic world that
matches Pandora on every visceral level. Give this film a break, see
it.
