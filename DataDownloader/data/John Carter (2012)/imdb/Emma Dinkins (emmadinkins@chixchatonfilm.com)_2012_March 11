As always a good idea will be taken and replayed again and again
especially when it comes to a hot commodity like a popular feature
film, in the case of John Carter it seemed to take a huge chunk from
Avatar. The problem is that once a film like Avatar comes and goes it
takes the originality with it, and as such some of the appeal from the
newness. This was another Cowboys and Indians on a different planet
story although the indigenous none human life form is pale green rather
than bright blue and in the middle of a red dessert instead of an
iridescent forest, there were just too many similarities to dispel. Not
that the similarities are a bad thing, the special effects were first
rate and the story was solid. Initially, I was completely perplexed as
to what the heck was going on because the first 30 minutes jumped from
scene to scene as much as John (Taylor Kitsch) did once he reached
Barsoom. The burning question that I had from the moment that I saw the
first trailer was, how the heck did John Carter get to Mars? And I must
say that I was thoroughly pleased with the answer to that question.
This film had good action when it was in action, there were moments
that I felt were too talky and all the talk was serving no purpose
other than to slow down the pace. The opening narrative explained
enough to know what was going on with the inhabitants of Barsoom and
the unfolding story details the events that brought John to this point
in his life. The Integration of Edgar Rice Burroughs into the story as
a crucial character was a nice way to pay homage to such a literary
wizard. I&#x27;m glad I ignored the critics who did not appreciate this film
and checked it out for myself. I was pleased with the acting which was
very solid from Dejah Thoris (Lilly Collins), and Dominic West (Sab
Than) tends to make a very good villain. I laughed at the &#x27;Virginia&#x27;
misunderstanding, I laughed at the attentive babysitter and I was
annoyed with the constant crying of the hatchlings. Although the
borrowing did not end with Avatar, since I&#x27;ve seen the Hulk use the
hyper powered jumping as his primary source of transportation too, I
was still thoroughly entertained. Had it not been for the slow talky
moments this would have gotten a green light, but alas amber light it
is.
