Wow, completely unexpected Epic Science Fiction, the feel of the movie
reminded me of Star Wars like the first time I met Luke Skywalker today
I met John Carter and it was a treat. The story has so much room to
grow but if it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m satisfied now, because the story is well
told the characters developed the special effects are well done and
thoughtful we saw it in 3D and it was perfectly executed. Performances
all around are even and solid, believable. Writer Director Andrew
Stanton who I might add wrote one of the best truly Sci-Fi Disney
Animated films of all time Wall-E shows his love and appreciation for
the genre and the source material I was in a word Impressed and
recommend anyone to go see this movie there is something for all ages
and its Big and no Sci-Fi Buff should miss this thrilling Adventure
Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud to see his work on the big silver
screen adapted with love and affection.
