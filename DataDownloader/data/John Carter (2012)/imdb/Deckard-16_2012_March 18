WOW! This is a much better film than a lot of the &#x22;lame stream media&#x22;
has given it credit for.<br /><br />Andrew Stanton&#x27;s jump into live action is every bit as enjoyable as his
excellent animated films like &#x22;Wall*E&#x22; &#x26; &#x22;Finding Nemo&#x22;.<br /><br />This fantastical tale of warring Martians clans &#x26; an American Civil War
calvary man who inexplicably gets caught up in the middle of it all is
strictly for romantics who want a rollicking good time at the theater.<br /><br />The acting is universally fine with leading man, Taylor Kitsch,
commanding it with all the authority his role demands. Actors like
Willem Dafoe &#x26; Thomas Hayden Church shine although they&#x27;re completely
unrecognizable as 12 foot tall green 4-armed Tharks.<br /><br />The effects are constantly breathtaking. Mars/Barsoom has never looked
so thrillingly un-Earth(Jarsoom)like.<br /><br />Despite its over 2 hour length this movie never dragged.<br /><br />The script &#x26; dialog are far better than the so-called critics say it
is.<br /><br />I burned through the book last summer, loved its almost quaint
treatment about all things sci-fi, honor, loyalty &#x26; love. This movie
did not let me down. Stanton has taken his passion for the material &#x26;
has produced a movie that is much more entertaining than Peter
Jackson&#x27;s equally lovingly produced &#x26; directed Lord Of The Rings
trilogy.<br /><br />I just hope Disney doesn&#x27;t give up on this movie (as it looks like they
will) because I really look forward to the next John Carter Of Mars
film.<br /><br />See this movie in 3-D.(The post conversion sets a new standard for such
work.)
