This really could have been made by George Lucas - in look and feel
it&#x27;s very close to Star Wars Episode 1 - and as others have pointed out
it has echoes of Sand and Sword epics from the Thief of Bagdad to 1001
Nights, as well as a dash of Dune, and all the rest, then a lot of
Flash Gordon - which all sounds wonderful - but the movie never really
takes off - even though it has more than set pieces, and, even though
it has romance, it lacks a spiritual aspect that elevates the viewer,
so what we get is really just some tribes in the desert waring with
each other - and that&#x27;s just not enough.<br /><br />It does have imagination and effects aplenty and if you like sci-fi
adventure in a classic mould then you will be entertained, but for this
reviewer it lacks that extra magic that takes us as viewers along with
them - it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint why this doesn&#x27;t involve the viewer as
much as it should - I suspect the plot is both overly complicated and
uninteresting and that doesn&#x27;t help. Editing is great, and the action
flows, but regrettably for us it never really caught the imagination.
