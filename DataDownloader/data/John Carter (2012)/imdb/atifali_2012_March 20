I can clearly say that this is the best science fiction movie i have
ever seen, which i would put in same category as Avatar. From my point
of view, this one is better than Avatar in some details.<br /><br />The characters, landscapes, machines, story ... Every little detail is
beautiful and breath taking. And it is really quiet shocking to know
that the book for this movie was written in 1910 s . What an
imagination.<br /><br />It runs for around two and a half hours, but let me tell you something,
i really felt there should be more. I could not keep track of time
while watching. I was really disappointed when the movie was over
because i only thought, just an hour has passed. The atmosphere just
gets you and you have no idea of how much time has passed. I would
watch at least one more hour.<br /><br />In short, if you like science fiction, than it is a MUST to go see it.
