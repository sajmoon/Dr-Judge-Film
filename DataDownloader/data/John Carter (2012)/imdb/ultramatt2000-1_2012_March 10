In a world where movies are nothing but exploiting subjects like the
war on terror, 9-11, the financial crisis, remakes, live-action
adaptations of cartoons and TV shows plus having our intelligence
insulted in a rather strong and nasty manner, there is nothing like a
good movie that gets our mind off of the horrors and stresses of
everyday life.<br /><br />Since 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s great stories about a man on Mars
grasped the attention of Hollywood. In 1932, Robert Clampett wanted to
make an animated adaptation of it, but it never happened. In 1958,
after Colombia made mountains of cash with THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF
SINBAD, there was planning to make a live-action adaptation with Ray
Harryhaussen&#x27;s special effects. It never happened. In the 1960&#x27;s Jim
Danforth (a fan of Burrough&#x27;s Mars stories),created test footage of the
Martians fighting a Banth (a Martian lion-like creature). Sadly, no one
was interested. In the 1980&#x27;s Disney grasped the rights and had plans
to adapt it starring Tom Cruise as John Carter battling stop-motion
monsters by Lyle Conway (DARK CRYSTAL and the original CLASH OF THE
TITANS). It never happened. All was calm until with the success of the
LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER franchise, it was time
resurrect the project at Paramount. Kerry Conran took control of it,
the gave the reigns to Jon Favreau (who would later play a Thark Bookie
in the final version). Alas, CGI test footage was all that was left.
Now it is Disney&#x27;s turn and this time the completed it. Forget about
The Asylum&#x27;s adaptation from 2009. Like Mario said to Luigi in an
animated College Humor skit about the live-action movie, &#x22;It never
happened!&#x22; <br /><br />The story (what wonderfully weird words like &#x22;Thark&#x22;, &#x22;Barsoom&#x22;,
&#x22;Woola&#x22; and &#x22;Tars Tarkas&#x22;), creatures (which were different from the
descriptions from the book, but I did not care), characters, special
effects, music, camera work and sound effects are awesome! It is worth
watching. It predated AVATAR, STARGATE, STAR WARS, SUPERMAN, FLASH
GORDON and Ray Bardbury&#x27;s THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES. So if you want to get
away from it all, this movie is your ticket. I saw it, loved and highly
recommend it. This movie is so good that it deserves a sequel. Please
give it the sequels that it deserved.<br /><br />10 out of 10 stars. <br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />(One last thought: I can&#x27;t believe that this incredible movie was made
under the memory of Steve Jobs. I guess it&#x27;s nice to honor him.)
