I have not seen more than half a dozen movies total I consider better
than this one. This is very high praise. I truly do not see how they
could possibly have done anything better without Taylor having
undergone swordsmanship, as opposed to fencing, lessons for a year or
so. Think how much better Ahnuld&#x27;s swordsmanship was in Red Sonja than
the awkward moves in the first Conan movie. I was pleasantly surprised
with the female lead having seen her in other movies. The woman cleaned
up real real good! The one change in the plot, and I think there should
be a nod of thanks to L.E. Modesitt, was an actual improvement. I will
say the less revealing costumes than those described by ERB are
probably more apropos for this prissy generation. I did think that it
might have been a spot truer to the original opening, but that would
have left a friend of John Carter hanging. I completely loved what they
did with Woolla though a somewhat slenderer and less comic critter has
inhabited my psyche for the past 5 decades.
