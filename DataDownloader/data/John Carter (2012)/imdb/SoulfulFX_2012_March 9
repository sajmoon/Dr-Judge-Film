This was a pretty entertaining sci-fi movie. The plot is rushed at some
points, but I guess readers of what this is originally based on
probably understood the gaps. As someone who never read the &#x22;Princess
of Mars,&#x22; I still found the plot easy to follow and actually fairly
well paced for a 2 hour runtime. The action sequences are nicely done
and except for the CG aliens, the special effects are not intrusive.<br /><br />I would have liked more time to explore the role of the highly-advanced
aliens responsible for the inter-world travel system...but otherwise, I
felt generally satisfied with the story.<br /><br />I saw one review or two say this was &#x22;Avatar-lite&#x22; but I disagree
somewhat. The earth-man rescuing the alien civilization part fits that
description, but &#x22;Avatar&#x22; was almost blow-for-blow the same as the
Pocahontas story... &#x22;John Carter&#x22; is NOT like that...its story is
indeed richer.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing.
