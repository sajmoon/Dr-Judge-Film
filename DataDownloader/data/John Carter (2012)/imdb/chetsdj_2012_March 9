Seen it and enjoyed totally in 3D... Beautifully made.. such a shame
that its getting a bad critics and ratings... i wish Walt Disney put
some heart in the marketing side and promoting it in an awesome way..
they left out some major punch lines like from &#x22;The Academy Award
Winner&#x22; Director &#x22;ANDREW STANTON&#x22; &#x26; &#x22;Based on the World&#x27;s 1st SCI-FI
STORY&#x22; by &#x22;Edgar Rich Burroughs&#x22; and things like that..it would have
made a Huge impacts on the good movie goers and everyone on this Earth
(JARSOOM):D .... i hope they don&#x27;t make these kinda small mistakes in
future for a multi hundred million dollars spent movies like this...
and a good one too.. don&#x27;t believe the Marketing or promo&#x27;s.... just go
and watch it... it&#x27;s beautifully done... every actors in this movie for
their respected characters have done justice to it...and finally not to
mention that its worlds 1st Sci-Fi story and please don&#x27;t think these
are taken from any other Sci-Fi movies like &#x27;STAR WARS&#x27; or &#x27;AVATAR&#x27; or
such kinda movies.. this movie have its pure and UnAdultrated story...
so please seriously watch it and enjoy it..<br /><br />PS: must watch people.. specially in 3D.<br /><br />Sequel Please.....
