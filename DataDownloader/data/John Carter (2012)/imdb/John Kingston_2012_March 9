I don&#x27;t get out to the cinema much these days, and when I do I often
pick the sci-fi films. This one turned out much better than some
sci-fis, and much better than I expected, perhaps because the hero&#x27;s
&#x22;super-powers&#x22; come from an entirely logical source; you or I too could
have super-powers in an identical situation. The situations that he
encounters are reminiscent of Star Wars episode 1 (there are even
characters who resemble Jar Jar Binks, though they&#x27;re much less
annoying - they&#x27;re a nice mix of brutal and humorous), plus they threw
in a gorgeous and definitely-not-helpless princess from Episode 4.
Though come to think of it, this story was published 50 years before
Star Wars, so maybe the copying was the other way round ... Anyway, if
you feel like watching a hero/princess story with 1800s technology and
with plenty of action and side-plots, go see this.
