Exactly what sci-fi/fantasy/action genres have been missing all these
years. Movie was a joy to watch and had the entire cinema audience
gasping, laughing and buzzing throughout (which is a rare thing these
days). A real pity it is performing so badly at the box office, most
likely due to bad marketing. Whether you are a film geek or just
looking for a fun movie to watch, male or female, definitely check it
out. Action, adventure, romance... there is a bit in there for
everyone. You wont be disappointed. The film had my wife and I smiling
throughout. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve been to the movies and had
that innocent childlike appreciation of a movie that just makes you
happy. <br /><br />I really do hope something magical happens and turns this box office
flop into a success so that more movies like this can be produced.
