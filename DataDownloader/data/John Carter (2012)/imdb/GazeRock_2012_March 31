This movie is a festive gathering of cheesiness and clich&#xE9;s. Storywise,
there is absolutely nothing that we haven&#x27;t seen before. You have the
typical main character; a brave warrior, who fears nothing, and goes
beyond any realistic standard of manliness. A princess, who has to get
married to a villain against her own will. Epic battles against alien
creatures. A loyal but goofy looking animal companion, following our
hero around. It&#x27;s honestly one clich&#xE9; after another. But let&#x27;s be
honest; everyone enjoys a good clich&#xE9; film from time to time! For me,
this was one of those films!<br /><br />The acting isn&#x27;t anything special, and I shall admit; at the beginning
of the movie, it had me quite annoyed at times. But once I had gotten
used to the at best mediocre way of acting, I realized it was actually
perfect to portray the cheesy storyline, and it actually gave a certain
kind of charm to this film.<br /><br />The graphics though, those were very well done! I loved the sceneries,
and even though the creature design wasn&#x27;t groundbreaking by any means,
it was still brilliantly done. The costume design was very typical, and
exactly what you&#x27;d expect from a movie like this. But with the cheesy
storyline the film has, you wouldn&#x27;t want to have it any other way!<br /><br />While watching this film, I actually felt quite embarrassed, because
all in all, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have enjoyed it as much as I did. But
I guess that&#x27;s what a guilty pleasure movie is all about. When it comes
to a clich&#xE9; film; this film is one of the most entertaining, and
visually satisfying that I&#x27;ve seen in a long time! So if you&#x27;re able to
enjoy a good cheesy storyline sci-fi that makes you feel like a total
dork for two hours, then this is a must see for you!
