2012_March 8 
It&#x27;s hard to believe, but it&#x27;s that time again. Blockbuster season. The
increasingly lengthy part of the year when Hollywood studios throw the
vast majority of their budgets at a handful of tent-pole releases,
competing for audience dollars in a barrage of explosive effects,
unimportant and underdeveloped plots, and the ever present corporate
sponsorship deals. It&#x27;s a risky time for Hollywood; a successful
blockbuster can develop into a cash-cow franchise for years to come,
whereas a failure can dangerously cripple even the most powerful
studios. In 2012, Disney gets us underway with JOHN CARTER, a project
stuck in production limbo for decades, finally realised by Pixar
director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, FINDING NEMO) making his live-action
debut. Getting out of the gate early to avoid any potential competition
is a clever move by Disney, yet it&#x27;s hard to imagine that JOHN CARTER
will come close to the kind of box-office revenues needed to consider
it a financial success. It&#x27;s not a bad film; in fact there is much to
be admired about Stanton&#x27;s work on a difficult property, but it exists
in an uncomfortable middle-ground of being perhaps too dense and
metaphorical for mainstream audiences whilst probably too generic and
clich&#xE9;d to impress hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans.<br /><br />What impresses most about JOHN CARTER is how, for the most part,
Stanton is allowed to run free with the strangeness of the world in
which the film is set. There are moments of pure brilliance, both
visually and thematically, where the movie that Stanton so obviously
wants to make are allowed to shine through, recalling the majesty of
the opening act of his previous film WALL-E. The film doesn&#x27;t hold your
hand and get bogged down with excessive exposition, but rather trusts
that audiences are familiar enough with the sci-fi genre that not
everything needs to be spelled out. Disney have to be commended for
taking an unexpected gamble and refusing to simplify much of the more
complicated areas of the story, but unfortunately it&#x27;s probably a
gamble that will not pay dividends. There are moments where the plot is
perhaps a little too obtuse, and the hard sci-fi conventions don&#x27;t
blend well with a dull, immaterial romantic sub-plot that sees the
emotional core of the film come off as a little hollow. Another brave
move was in the casting of an unproven, if not entirely unknown lead
actor in Taylor Kitsch, who growls his way through the dialogue in a
satisfactory but unfortunately uncharismatic manner.<br /><br />Sadly, where JOHN CARTER is going to suffer most is in its familiar and
unoriginal storyline. Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; BARSOOM series of novels
are something of a Rosetta Stone to the sci-fi/fantasy genre,
stretching back a century to A PRINCESS OF MARS, the novel on which
Stanton&#x27;s film takes the majority of its plot. Being such a beloved and
influential series works against Disney however, as Burroughs&#x27; novels
have been imitated, borrowed from, and essentially plucked clean by
almost every other film in the genre. Now, when JOHN CARTER arguably
should be respected for being a true original, instead what results is
a stylistically and thematically dusty work. Had JOHN CARTER been made
40 years ago, before STAR WARS, AVATAR, and any number of similar
films, it would have undoubtedly been a smash, but as it is today, it&#x27;s
difficult to view it as much more than the same hackneyed story we&#x27;ve
seen before. It&#x27;s a shame that Burroughs importance to the genre will
be completely over the head of most audiences, but a little more
outside-the-box thinking from Stanton and Disney may have been able to
salvage the film and introduce a new generation to his work. JOHN
CARTER is not going to break Disney, yet the almost inevitably
disappointing box-office is certainly going to hurt. It&#x27;s a fascinating
start to the season, and for better or worse JOHN CARTER will almost
certainly go down as the riskiest prospect on the blockbuster calendar.<br /><br />tinribs27.wordpress.com
