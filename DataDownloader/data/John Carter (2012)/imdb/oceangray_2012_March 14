Well for the life of me I cannot see how this has had so many bad
reviews. Did the critics ever actually watch the film??? Mind you going
on the Oscars and the winners there I can see why this did not fare
well. I mean this is actually a great enjoyable film.<br /><br />I wont give the story away or leave any spoilers. I will say this is
the best film I have seen in over a year and I CANNOT wait to buy this
on blu-ray. I hope they continue the series and I look forward to
seeing more of the leading actors.<br /><br />Great film, with fantastic effects, great acting and a superb plot.
Will no doubt go down as a classic over time. If you want to take the
kids out to see a great action adventure or you just fancy escaping the
drool of everyday life, go for a trip to Bassoon and explore a great
new world with some interesting characters.<br /><br />Just because something has been done before does not mean it cannot be
done better John Carter......Simply stunning
