This entire movie looks like a spin off of the Star Wars Cantina
scene... much like the Ewoks &#x22;movie,&#x22; a generally bad idea. General
audiences loved Avatarded because of the sell-out story. Cutting that
but focusing on the wild video game quality of the John Carter
characters and crazy universe is as bad of an idea as possible for a
summer film. General Audiences are going to ignore this film in droves.
The ones that do take a flyer will savage it and word of mouth will be
awful from the non-fanboy non-super sci-fi crowd. Trust me, it&#x27;s a bad
and near incoherent mess of a film.<br /><br />What&#x27;s really sad is the fact that the movie itself seems to be one big
parody of the sci-fi genre. The film&#x27;s laughably bad because the dialog
is one long joke and the live action cartoonish stuff never rings true.
They try to inject humor and even sentimentality where there&#x27;s really
no place for it at all. Even as a live action cartoon, this film just
doesn&#x27;t work. Fans won&#x27;t be disappointed.When Warner&#x27;s declared they
needed a franchisee to replace Harry Potter &#x26; JC is a viable one,I was
skeptical.Now,not so much.
