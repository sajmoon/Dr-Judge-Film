Since I saw the first trailer last year and since I was a boy reading
Burrough&#x27;s stories, I&#x27;d been wanting to see this movie. Of course, as a
pubescent kid, it was mostly because they didn&#x27;t wear clothes on Mars.
Knowing that 1. Disney was at the helm of this movie and 2. it didn&#x27;t
star Johnny Depp, I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to be impressed. I&#x27;m
neither a fan of Friday Night Lights (sorry Taylor) nor am I a fan of
X-Men Origin: Wolverine (Sorry Ms. Collins). I was so pleased then when
the movie was as excellent as it was. Kitsch and Collins were excellent
together. The action was paced perfectly. The voice acting for the CGI
characters was just about perfect. Once I saw it, I went home, got my
wife and took her. My wife is absolutely against action movies, and
believes that 3D is actually a torture device used against moviegoers,
but even she found it visually engaging and excellent. Went home and
got &#x22;Princess of Mars&#x22; for her Tablet.
