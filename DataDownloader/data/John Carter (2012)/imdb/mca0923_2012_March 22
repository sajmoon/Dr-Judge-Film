The Martian characters were probably the highlight. The green skinned
Tharks were great, as was the setting. You could probably see where
most of the budget went, though speaking personally I can&#x27;t say that
the promotional budget of some $100million was well spent. Lots of
people I&#x27;ve mentioned the film to have never even heard of it. The
title is poor really - should have been something less anonymous -
maybe &#x27;Barsoom&#x27; for example after the name the inhabitants use for
Mars. The dialogue might not have been as snappy and memorable as some
might like, but perfectly serviceable for an action film. The acting
was fine too - nothing like as bad as the critics would have you
believe.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed it - and this speaking as a huge fan of the original
books.<br /><br />So take a chance, and make up your own mind.
