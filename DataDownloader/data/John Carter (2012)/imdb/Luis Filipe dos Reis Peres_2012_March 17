Wow, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this at all ! I cannot remember the last I&#x27;ve
seen an American Hollywood blockbuster where i actually cared for the
characters in a story. OK, Lord of the Rings, but that does not count ,
because it was mainly a new Zealand epic.<br /><br />I have to admit i was expecting the worse for John Carter. Specially
when i saw the trailers which focus more on the action and effects, and
so i was totally convinced this was going to be another Cgi effects
show off and Hollywood had ruined the original novel by transforming it
into another Michael Bay style movie or something like that, as usual
nowadays with all the plastic boring popcorn stuff that&#x27;s created to
fill shopping centers movie theaters for a week and thats it. Boy, was
i wrong !<br /><br />I cannot recall the last time i wanted to go buy another ticket and go
right in to see once again a movie i just did finishing watching, but
it happened with this one, and nobody is more surprised than i am. As a
big fan of the original Burroughs novels, i was dreading the day when
Hollywood would chop them off into digital meaningless pooh. Not here
folks !<br /><br />OK, its not exactly the best book adaptation ever, but nevertheless is
a bit like in Blade Runner. John Carter the movie might not be the most
faithful book translation, but nevertheless it&#x27;s still John Carter the
novel in a strange fascinating way. And, in a lot of aspects it really
is a lot better than the book ! How weird is this ?! When the book was
written about a century or so ago, it really was ahead of its time, but
now after all these movie and television decades , all that was
invented on the original novels , everybody has seen it thousands of
times in movies and TV. That, i thought it would be the death of this
John Carter movie project because generations of movie goers already
seen all there is inside these Bourroughs books , as ... &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;,
&#x22;Dune&#x22;, &#x22;Avatar&#x22; , etc, etc,etc<br /><br />Everything that now seems like a clich&#xE9; in John Carter, its pure
illusion, as the original novels were the ones that developed the
concepts in the first place. Nevertheless, because of this , and
because of the action filled trailers, i was not expecting to be as
good as it is. And its good, because its a blockbuster with a soul
which bases all his strenght not only in the visual look, but above all
in its characters ! In fact, the visuals are exciting because we really
care for whats happening with the characters in the first place. John
Carter of Mars delivered the kind of fantasy movie experience I first
thought i would see in the new Star Wars trilogy. There&#x27;s more soul,
imagination and wonderment in ten minutes in John Carter than in ten
hours of Sw episodes, one,two and three. Hollywood take notes. This is
how you do it ! Keep doing it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the characters in this movie. Even the secondary
characters are well defined and everything works to depict a
fascinating martian world that does not depend on Cgi over the top
video game stuff to be a great adventure sci-fi fantasy movie. The
humor is well inserted, not over the top one liners and the dog is
simply brilliant, by the way. ;)<br /><br />John Carter compensates for the (now) lack of story originality, with
details and texture. It does an incredible work with that, adding
things that weren&#x27;t exactly in the novel. This is a movie about details
, not about special effects. Although the effects are amazing, its the
usual well crafted art we are accustomed to see, because, surprise,
surprise , the effects are really here to illustrate the story and not
just to look cool !! I was not expecting this at all. The real magic
here is in the details that give life to the martian world and
characters. From the tribal alien characterizations into the way the
plot is weaved to connect the characters , everything is perfect in my
opinion. And believe me, I&#x27;m so sick and tired of Hollywood plastic
blockbusters you wouldn&#x27;t believe it. Nevertheless this is one of the
best action adventure movies in many years released by the American
popcorn factory.<br /><br />Also, loved the cast too. I loved the fact they were all fresh faces,
or mostly are not exactly part of the star system. John Carter of Mars
starring Tom Cruise would never be the same.<br /><br />Overall, i cannot wait to get this movie in DVD or blue-ray! I think
everyone in this production should be congratulated, specially who
wrote this and the director ! <br /><br />Well done Disney ! Now make another please.<br /><br />Now i have to go back and read the books once again...oh well...
