I had some expectation why I wanted to watch this film. I had no
information about it, except a line that this film is based on Edgar
Rice Burroughs&#x27;s book. It started like a normal remake but turned to a
surreal vision of a hurt brain about something. After ten minutes it
was obvious that the original story and author has only a very loose
connection to this film. The story does not worth more. The actors are
forming unrealistic characters. It seems that they did their job only
for the money without any efforts to play characters -if there is any
at all. The director seems not to have minimal assumption about the
story had to be filmed. In summary: Primitive story, no connection to
the original book. The creators have stolen only a couple of names from
Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the magic of former Pixar classics is
inexplicably and sadly lost here. Category &#x22;Z&#x22; actors in the place of
Pixar favorites, but is true that their level of play is comparable
with the whole film. It is very difficult to understand who was able to
give money for this. Waste of time even a minute. One star what I gave
is exactly one star more than it worth, but there is no option for
zero.
