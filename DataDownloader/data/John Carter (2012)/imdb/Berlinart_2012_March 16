Fantastic amount of fun--beautiful to behold and if you don&#x27;t like this
one, you must be a tired old critic who has been influenced negatively
by the Therns! Don&#x27;t miss it on the big screen!An old fashion
swashbuckling tribute to one of the most influential writers of pop
culture of the 20th century! Apparently critics found themselves
ill-prepared to follow a story that involves multiple faction vying for
control of a planet. I did&#x27;nt.I have seen it twice. Enjoyed it more the
second time. It is a very richly detailed film with plenty to take in.I
am a huge fan of ERB and there are some changes from the source
material but it is minor compared to the total amount used from the
books.I don&#x27;t see films to embrace secular humanist, existential
dilemmas like most of the creative typists the newspapers employ as
critics. I go for escapist entertainment and buddy, this was it!
