I LOVED THIS FILM. <br /><br />Since I read &#x27;Synthetic Men of Mars&#x27; as a teen I have waited for this
to be rendered on film and I was not disappointed. It definitely
follows the spirit of the story and setting. Sure there were some
changes, but bear in mind this was written as &#x27;PULP&#x27; Sci-Fi 100 years
ago. To translate to our generation it HAD to have a little adaptation,
and the writers did just fine. You immediately love John Carter from
the very beginning and Lynn Collins as Deja-Thoris is both stunning and
a powerful. She portrays the basic elements of the character while
kicking ass with the best of them. I saw it in 3D (which I normally
don&#x27;t do as I feel it often derails the director from portraying the
story). Movies that intentionally POP out at you are crass &#x27;LOW&#x27;
theater IMHO. In this case the film never made a point of letting you
know it was 3D by simply enriching the background and lending it more
realism through a better depth of field.&#xFEFF; The CG was VERY well done. I
loved the Green men of Mars and forgot that they were entirely CG&#x27;d
(which is the point). OK so the fact that the Red martians dressed a
bit like Romans was a little obvious, but hey, I bought in fairly
quickly so no prob really.<br /><br />In short this is a well done film worth seeing.
