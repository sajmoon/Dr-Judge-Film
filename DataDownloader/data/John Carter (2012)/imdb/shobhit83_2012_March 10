After a long long time ...a wonderful movie with well written and
directed plot, thrilling special effects,a must watch in 3D, awesome
locations..... i must say its a masterpiece and am sure this movie will
make million fans.<br /><br />I really appreciate Taylor Kitsch for his stupendous performance. No
one else can fit this role better. This movie is based on 100 yr old
novel from Edgar Rice but the way it is presented is really awesome.
From actions to costume, humans to aliens, space ships to animals is
all balanced and complimenting each other.Compared to other Sci Fi
action movies like star wars or avatar sometimes you feel them fake or
artificial but John carter seems to be more realistic and natural. <br /><br />Hats off! I will give 10 on 10.
