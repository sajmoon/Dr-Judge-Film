Well, I don&#x27;t know what the clueless critics are yipping about
regarding this movie not worth seeing, but both me (I&#x27;m 45yrs old) and
my 10 yr old son thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Simply summarized:<br /><br />Loads of action.<br /><br />Fantastic story.<br /><br />Great acting.<br /><br />Warm ending. (what else would you expect, it&#x27;s Disney!)<br /><br />The only 2 things that I could criticize are:<br /><br />1) The sound seemed sub-average? It didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough or
&#x22;surround sound&#x22; enough for me and the theatre we were in is well kept,
not old &#x26; normally phenomenal for any other big budget movies seen in
it. <br /><br />2) Personally, I didn&#x27;t see the need for the 3D, although my 10 yr old
son who has A.D.D. said afterwards it felt like only 45 minutes had
passed by, not the more than 2 hours the movie it is and he didn&#x27;t take
his medication like I normally suggest whenever we see a movie to keep
him interested and not bouncing around in his seat. <br /><br />If that doesn&#x27;t say something about how entertaining the movie is, I
don&#x27;t know what else could? <br /><br />So, my opinion, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BONEHEAD MOVIE CRITICS and pay
whatever it costs to see a great flick. <br /><br />I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it again once it&#x27;s released on DVD on my
70&#x22; LCD with the stereo blaring out! Cheers.
