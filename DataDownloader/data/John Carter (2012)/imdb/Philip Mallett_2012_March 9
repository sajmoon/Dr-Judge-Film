It&#x27;s worth noting that my view before going into see &#x22;John Carter&#x22; was
nor for or against, unlike many of the &#x27;trolls&#x27; and &#x27;fanboys&#x27; among
this films Message Board. Those endlessly hating on the film for no
apparent purpose or gain, just as equal, the die-hard ERB fans take too
many liberties in assuming the movie has to be good because of it&#x27;s
source material. Trust me, just because the original material is great
(which the &#x27;of Mars&#x27; books are) does not mean the big-screen adaption
is going to follow suit.<br /><br />In keeping the majority of the contents of the film unknown to those
who haven&#x27;t seen anymore than what was advertised, it will probably
appear that I&#x27;m dancing around the plot, but I feel it necessary to
outline much of what the marketing campaign failed to do, while keeping
the surprise of seeing the movie blissfully ignorant intact.<br /><br />Everything you&#x27;ve seen in the trailers, from the superhuman leaps the
titular protagonist makes, to the &#x27;how and why&#x27; of his presence on
Mars, are explained intelligently, and without boorish exposition. The
set-pieces are awe-inspiring and do a fine tribute to how Mars was so
creatively described in Edgar Rice Burroughs imaginative novel. Having
read &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22;, I can say there quite a similar view of
&#x22;Barsoom&#x22; (as the it&#x27;s native inhabitants call it) between how I
imagined it, and it was depicted. The action sequences are unequal to
anything I&#x27;ve seen in many years. It had a reflection of classic cinema
that draws you in so much, that you feel just as much on Mars as you
are on Earth.<br /><br />The film visually didn&#x27;t have any subtractions. Camera angles, and
extremely convincing CGI put this film ahead of it&#x27;s time. By that, I
mean it has the charm of a classic, on par with works of Marlon Brando
or Charlton Heston, while also being modern in not only its
storytelling, but its visualization of ERB&#x27;s classic tale. My one
nit-pick, which virtually went unnoticed for most of the scenes where
it took place, was a few angles of John Carter leaping did stick-out to
me one or twice where it had an overall appearance of him being pulled
upward by a harness, rather than a hop due to lower gravity than that
on Earth. But I was engaged in the movie so much that it didn&#x27;t remove
me from the movie at all, or detract from my overall experience.<br /><br />Noting the films director, Andrew Stanton, you couldn&#x27;t help but notice
his quality storytelling that makes you not only connect with the
characters, but care about what happens to them. A bit of the romance
between John Carter, and his damsel in distress Princess Dejah Thoris
seemed rushed, but for the sake of convenience of storytelling in a
2-hour movie that does its best to keep great pacing, I can easily
overlook it due to both Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins in they&#x27;re
respective performances.<br /><br />From being to end, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. John Carter is a
fun, dazzling, joy-ride of cinema-magic that we have seemed to take for
granted in modern movies. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it
was, as many of the audience-goers that attended the same showing
seemed to be too! I plan on seeing it a second time next week! So this
is definitely worth seeing!
