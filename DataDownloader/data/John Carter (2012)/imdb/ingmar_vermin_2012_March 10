While it&#x27;s not &#x27;Sucker Punch&#x27; bad - at least it&#x27;s kinda goofy fun, nor
is it &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27; bad (at least it doesn&#x27;t seem cynically made) -
it&#x27;s more like &#x22;Attack of the Clones&#x22; bad. But really - 250 to 300 mil
on this!! It&#x27;s like Dune meets Krull meets Caligula meets Prince of
Persia meets renewing your license at DMV. It&#x27;s shockingly boring, it&#x27;s
not an &#x22;event&#x22; movie, it&#x27;s an &#x22;un-event&#x22; movie. <br /><br />You sit in the theater - (a semi empty theater in a major city at
Friday 7pm, opening day) - Imagine an incompetent remake of &#x22;Lawrence
of Arabia&#x22; by animation nerds, filled with gibberish dialog and then
put thru the Disney Studio suits committee.<br /><br />If you insist on seeing it in the theater, skip the stereo 3D and wear
ear plugs, I think the dialog is the worst thing - tho JC has many,
many problems.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a huge disconnect between the pulpy source material plus the
Frazetta sexed up vision that we grew up with and the reek of the
nurtured, lobotomized Disney corporate culture that is all over JC.<br /><br />In the 80&#x27;s there was a scoftcore Indy-ish rip-off, erotic movie called
the &#x22;Perils of Gwendoline&#x22;, John Carter is quite reminiscent of it (the
bad parts and visual look but not the sexy parts) and Disney could
recoup some cost perhaps by releasing a soft-core version of this.
