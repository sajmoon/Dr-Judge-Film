First of all, I would like to say to the head of live-action at Disney
who tried to kill this film, and the marketing team, who worked on the
majority of this film, which also failed miserably; you can both suck
it. Anyone who actually sees this film knows, just like &#x27;Iron Giant&#x27;
that something was going on behind the scenes, to purposefully kill
this project. The ball was dropped. This is one of the best science
fiction films I&#x27;ve seen since the &#x27;70s or &#x27;80s. I loved the book. The
movie looked amazing. The writing and storytelling was epic and
flawless. The acting was fantastic. And why wouldn&#x27;t it be, it was done
by Pixar! You really have to wonder why none of those names were
dropped while marketing this film. Oh, wait, no you don&#x27;t, since Disney
was purposefully trying to kill this film.<br /><br />&#x27;Avatar&#x27; was good, but, like &#x27;Titanic,&#x27; it wasn&#x27;t exactly a complex
story. It was really paint-by-the-numbers and predictable. This was a
good story, that followed the old sci-fi story telling of films like
&#x27;Star Wars,&#x27; where there is an actual plot, conflict, good versus evil,
heroes with character, excitement, mystery, fantastic places, a
conquest, emotional investment in the characters. It was a well-crafted
piece of writing and an excellent adaptation from the book.<br /><br />There should be more films like this instead of the giant Michael Bay
turds that keep being dished out. So, thank you Team Disney for killing
the only truly great sci-fi film that has been made in the past 15
years. Way to kill a genre.
