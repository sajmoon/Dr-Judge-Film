I enjoyed this movie! It is entertaining and has everything from
imagination, visual effects, romantic plot, fighting, etc etc.. One
should not compare this to a more serious movie like Troy but
appreciate in the method it was done and after all we want to be
entertained and enjoy the time spent.. This movie will do the job! I
recommend that you go see it and judge for yourself! I don&#x27;t like why
negative statements were released by Disney managers or producers in
regards to achieving $200M, they should realize that does impact an
ongoing release which I think it can meet its budget especially
counting international sales and later Blue-Ray, DVDs etc.. Anyways you
will see many positive feedback on this movie once you go through the
reviews..
