Razzies are assured for John Carter next year. It looks as if Disney
simply borrowed and recycled the sets of Prince of Persia and The Last
Airbender, adding leftover props from The Phantom Menace and Cowboys
and Aliens.<br /><br />The studio touted this movie as if it was an expected &#x22;epic movie&#x22;
whose time had finally come. Problem is though that a majority of the
target demographic have no idea who John Carter is and why in the hell
is he on a Mars that looks more like a hybrid of Avatar and Kevin
Sorbo&#x27;s Hercules? <br /><br />Disagree all you want, but Hollywood is telling me that competent
marketing could have drawn in women with the love story, or attracted
younger males who weren&#x27;t fanboys of the source material. Instead the
campaign was as rigid and confusing as the movie itself, not to mention
that others watched it too and he said that they didn&#x27;t really
understand any of it. . Warring tribes with goofy names like Tharks,
Heliumites and Zodangans look like Jar Jar Binks or something and sound
more appropriate to a Dr. Seuss cartoon, or the Pixar animation realm
Stanton hails from, than to a live-action interstellar adventure. <br /><br />Bottom line is that Ferngully was the first movie made. Then Avatar was
made. Then John Carter was the 3rd. Disney is now being further crushed
at the fact that audiences are walking out halfway through the film,
unable to sit through the trainwreck of a film that has caused Disney&#x27;s
stock to drop 22% in only three days. Executives are left in the
dreaded position at now knowing a complete and total lack of interest
on the part of the public has doomed this project. <br /><br />Even genre film lovers have standards, and John Carter meets them only
partway. It is not an Oliver Stone picture full of fallacies and
innuendos. Nor, like David Lynch, is it a living puzzle in a nightmare
universe. It is simply to enjoy, like &#x22;Tron: Legacy&#x22; and other
actioners.
