I was surfing on internet and I accidentally found trailer that
computer made Resident Evil movie is coming to town! As I played all 4
games (and I long await fifth), I was very excited!<br /><br />When I finally watched it, I was satisfied. It has some captivating
scenes, CGI is doe perfectly, and Claire is better then ever... They
tried to include all characters from Resident Evil franchise. As for
the plot is considered, that is the only reason why I have given it 7.
It&#39;s hard these days to make a good plot that will keep you edge of the
seat whole movie. This one is decent, not so good, not so bad...<br /><br />I can&#39;t say nothing more about this movie, if you are a fan of the game
and movies, you will adore this one... If you are not familiar with
serial (I don&#39;t know if there is a person that isn&#39;t), then this movie
will be decent for you...
