Rented it out of pure curiosity, I&#39;ve seen all the movies but never
played the games, then again, I don&#39;t think one needs to have read the
books, played the games, or watched the original in order to enjoy a
stand-alone movie if written well. <br /><br />Which this feature did, there wasn&#39;t any moments that made me say &quot;huh?
&quot;, things were pretty well spelled out, maybe a little to well at some
points but I can live with that. <br /><br />What made this movie a really rough watch was the animation. Oh geez it
was almost painful at some points. Everyone moved like they used the
original Star Wars action figures from the 70&#39;s as reference for
articulation, and the lip-synch&#133; I understand that motion capturing of
the mouth is the hardest thing to do but at least they could try and
get some of it right rather than just have the characters move their
lips in random ways in hopes that&#39;ll match up with the dialog. <br /><br />As for the scenery &#150; things were just a bit to clean, everything came
off looking like smooth plastic, including, faces, monsters, d&eacute;cor, and
explosions. No texture was really added, not even a mild attempt at it. <br /><br />Like I said, the story is fair, nothing outstanding which helped keep
my attention but the visuals were a huge distraction.
