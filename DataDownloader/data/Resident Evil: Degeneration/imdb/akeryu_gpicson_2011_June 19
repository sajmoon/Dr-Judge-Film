A must for RE fans. A must for those who like zombies and horror
survival types of movies. Unlike the Resident Evil movies, this CG
animation feature follows the story of the Resident Evil game. This
movie is set seven years after the events of the Resident Evil 2 game
where two of the survivors of the Raccoon City tragedy(Leon S. Kennedy
and Claire Redfield) are to survive one more time. The airport scene at
the beginning is dark and chaotic because of the zombie outbreak while
the final scene features a mutated monster on a rampage. This horror
movie has a decent animation and it has an almost non stop action
scenes which will give you the feeling of playing the RE game and how
it should be played.
