Although its not the best film ever it seems people seem to be giving
it incredibly low and unrealistic scores. Its a film that can hold its
own and stands far superior against the live action counterparts. I&#39;ve
read a comment where someone wrote &#39;this movie actually feels like a
video game&#39;... I really did think the point of the film was that its
supposed to have come from a game. The sequence of events felt like
more than one survival horror game i have played in the past, and i
don&#39;t think thats a bad thing.<br /><br />This is what people have been asking for when it comes to movies based
on games, and to be honest, this is a great start to DECENT film making
from games. Resident evil movies were terrible, this can stand alone
and be good. To those who say it would have been better as a live
action film... It would have been more disappointing to see anyone try
to represent a video game character, CG is perfect for game to film
productions. Lets hope if there&#39;s a Devil may cry film coming it&#39;ll be
in CG too.<br /><br />This film was great, i just wish it was a little longer, the G virus
scenes seemed a little condensed, but wasn&#39;t too rushed. The storyline
fit with the games but can stand alone, and the characters... well i&#39;ll
wait to see it in Japanese with subtitles before commenting on the
dialogue. Do people not realise the fact that its dubbed? Bad
translations can ruin a film. Watching any studio ghibli films, you can
see the Japanese dialogue is slightly different to the translated
English dubbed versions making the dialogue quality vary depending on
which language you watch it in. The film made sense and was worth
watching.
