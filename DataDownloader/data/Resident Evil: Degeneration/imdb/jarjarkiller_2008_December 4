For an all CG, sorta on the fence of the uncanny valley movie, its way
way better than the last 2 resident evil movies that came out here in
the states. CG wise it&#39;s no Final Fantasy or Pixar film, but honestly,
story wise and even the acting in the voice overs come off as more
natural than the last 2 movies in the American Franchise. Its a shame.
Capcom should have done the movies themselves to begin with instead of
giving it to Anderson. Just to repeat myself...the voice acting on this
movie is really surprisingly well acted. And there are really some
gruesome and scary parts in it. I&#39;m no fan boy, far from it, but future
animation film producers need to take note on how seriously these
filmmakers took the &quot;acting&quot; on this movie.
