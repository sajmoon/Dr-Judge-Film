This is a film for people that love the game. The film is cheesy but so
is the game. Personally I love it because I loved the games since the
original version. It captures the style of the game perfectly, it is
just a passive version. The sounds and visual cues are particularly
evocative, drawing on memories of the game. The animation is decent but
not close enough to reality to be particularly weird. The dialog is
overly dramatic but I cannot help smiling when I hear it. &#x22;Step away
from the door Jill. I&#x27;m going to kick this door down&#x22;. Anyone?<br /><br />Would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loved the game as much
as me, but if you didn&#x27;t play it you are unlikely to get it and should
avoid.
