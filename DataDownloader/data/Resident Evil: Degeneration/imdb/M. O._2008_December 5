Of course that, like Final Fantasy: Advent Children, RE: Degeneration
was also made for the fans and for those ones who are familiar to the
stories behind the happenings over the game series.<br /><br />RE: Degeneration is an &quot;episode&quot; after the happenings of RE 2 and RE 4,
so if you&#39;ve already played these ones you will notice some
familiarities, but if you haven&#39;t, what you already know by the crap
movie trilogy is kinda useful. Anyway, its a lot enjoyable.<br /><br />Even being a CG movie, it has a lot of action and the movie follows the
same steps of each game of the series, so it has references of the
games all the time like: the different big and rich scenarios that are
more than just scenarios but part of the story and also enemies of the
characters; the new characters being presented, each one of them having
their very own importance in the story; the zombies that pops
everywhere and also the final boss, that gets bigger and bigger on each
new episode of the game series.<br /><br />Of course that, the best thing about this movie is the great come back
of some of the most loved characters of the series like the best and
smartest special agent Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, a sweet
girl that has the strength and courage of a lion. Both Leon and Claire
are portrait here exactly like they are in the games.<br /><br />The CG movie is also very faithful to the games, I mean... even the CG
are similar to the games CG, giving the feeling that at any moment the
game will starts or you will have to press a command at any moment, and
that&#39;s very thrilling for the fans.<br /><br />Well, that&#39;s it... that&#39;s sad for me to say - as a movie lover and also
a RE fan that has been playing the series since 1996 - that the best
Resident Evil movie is a CG movie, and that is a shame for the movie
trilogy and everyone involved in it. The Resident Evil trilogy is a
reputation destroyer for the game series and RE: Degeneration finally
comes to deliver what the fans were missing: something new but faithful
to the games.
