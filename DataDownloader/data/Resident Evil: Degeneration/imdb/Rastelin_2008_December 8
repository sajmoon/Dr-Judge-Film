It is important to remember It is important to remember that this is a
fan movie. For someone like me it was great fun to be reunited with
characters one played in the games. Much to it&#39;s defense this
production stayed more true to the atmosphere in the games that recent
flicks, something every Resident Evil fan will recognize. As for those
of you not familiar with the games I won&#39;t vouch for the movie, but you
may have a enjoyable time watching it anyway.<br /><br />For the tec stuff. Graphics are all there although some of the
animation could have been done better. This is not Pixar quality people
say, but do have in mind the type of budget Pixar and the like have to
work with.<br /><br />All around a decent go at bringing a game legend to the animated
screen.
