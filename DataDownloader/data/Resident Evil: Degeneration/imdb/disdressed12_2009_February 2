this is the third movie i&#39;ve watched today,and like the other
two(Bangkok Dangerous,and Traitor)i find myself disappointed.this is
the first CG animated full length Resident Evil film.i found the
animation lacking.the character movements are jerky and the facial
movements don&#39;t sync up with the body language.i also thought the story
was lacking,and the action wasn&#39;t exactly stellar,in my mind.yet i was
more entertained with this movie than either of Bangkok Dangerous or
Traitor.i mean it is fairly fast paced.i just wish they could have had
more of the characters from the previous Resident Evil films,and with
the original voices.for me,Resident Evil:Degeneration is a 6/10
