Resident Evil: Degeneration is the first CG Resident Evil film. I think
this is the first in a CG series of Resident Evil, which I am excited
for, since this movie was such a success (in my opinion. It has
references of the Racoon City disaster, and also the past viruses like
the g-virus. Now this movie isn&#x27;t gory, sorry for you gore fans, but I
mean it is a violent movie. Not much bad language, mainly just minor
stuff. Its a well done film, and it has some comical stuff. Also, the
CG is fantastic, it is well done CG. So to wrap up, it is a very well
done movie, even if you don&#x27;t like the games too much, it is a good
horror movie. Though, it will be a more enjoyable experience f you know
a little about this game series. 9/10
