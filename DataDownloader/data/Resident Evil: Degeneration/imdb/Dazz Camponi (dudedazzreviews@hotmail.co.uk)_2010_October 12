After watching the below-average Resident Evil movies, I prayed that
the next Resident Evil movie would actually have something to do with
the games. Fortunately for me, and probably many Resident Evil gamers
out there, my prayers were answered. Claire Redfield and Leon S.
Kennedy, two of the rare survivors of Raccoon City from the video games
(shock!), are drawn into the intrigue as the airport in Harvardville
comes under attack by a rogue warrior seeking revenge for the death of
his family at Raccoon City. And as if the zombies created by the
T-virus weren&#x27;t enough, the deadly G-virus is also released and creates
a new rampaging mutant.<br /><br />Basically a must buy for fans of the game series and the movies and a
must watch for those who like zombie movies. I loved how the movie kind
of felt like an hour and a half cutscene from a game, it added a really
nice touch. The CGI is actually quite impressive for a straight-to-DVD
release and I&#x27;m sure there are quite a few people out there who would
agree to this. The original voices of the characters from the
videogames, I felt, made the movie more original although there were
two or three times where the dialogue was just mediocre. The plot and
story were great and easy to follow and the flow and timing of the
movie was just right. The ending wasn&#x27;t rushed at all and I felt that
the movie-length was okay, it wasn&#x27;t too long or too short. Some of the
characters in the movie are quite good and yet there are one or two who
you couldn&#x27;t really care about. The music was quite good and yet again
felt like it came straight out of the games (in a good way).<br /><br />Overall, it was a great movie but it&#x27;s basically one for the gamers.
Resident Evil fans (movie or games) would probably adore this movie but
if you&#x27;re not a fan of any of the games or movies, chances are you
might not like it. This reviewer is a fan of the games (not the movies
though, eurgh!) and this reviewer gives Degeneration two thumbs-up.<br /><br />Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
