After when, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, was released in 2008, Hollywood has been
adapting a lot of comic-book&#x27;s even if there unknown comic-book&#x27;s.
Warner Bros. Decided to adapt the DC comic-book character, Green
Lantern.<br /><br />The story is about a test pilot named, Hal Jordan, who find&#x27;s a dying
alien and Hal is given a green ring. Once he put&#x27;s the green ring on,
he is given the power to imagine anything and it can come to life. He
also end&#x27;s up being a, Green Lantern.<br /><br />Pro&#x27;s: The special effects were really amazing and the action scene&#x27;s
were nicely done.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong do good job&#x27;s as there character&#x27;s, Hal
Jordan and Sinestro. <br /><br />Con&#x27;s: The character development was really weak because most of the
character&#x27;s have no important role and people who played them were
pretty bad. For example, we only see Sinestro in about 3 to 5 scene&#x27;s
in the movie. Really, Warner Bros? Really?<br /><br />The character&#x27;s were also weak. For example, Hector Hammond is just a
whiny character who does nothing but scream most of the time. Not to
mention Hal Jordan&#x27;s love interest, Carol Ferris, she was really
boring.<br /><br />The movie was also slow and really boring. <br /><br />Overall, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;, is really disappointing and it&#x27;s not up there
with the other comic-book movies of 2011.
