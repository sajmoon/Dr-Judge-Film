Contrary to what MANY professional critics have to say about it, green
Lantern is an enjoyable superhero movie, but one that doesn&#x27;t quite
live up to its potential. My biggest concern was Ryan Reynolds casting
as Hal Jordan, and I was pleasantly surprised in this movie. He is a
little jokey, but certainly not too much as to detract from the
character. The parts of the movie that are not on Earth are great, from
the opening scene to the Lanterns home world OA. Mark Strong as
Sinestro is quite good and Peter Sarsgaard as hector Hammond is also
good. While this movie does have flaws, mainly being some editing of
scenes that seem to end to quickly and the main villain isn&#x27;t too
villainous. Plus, the final fight is a bit too short. All in all
though, the movies strengths make up for its flaws. I think the main
reason that critics have hammered the movies is that Thor and X-Man
have come before and were both excellent, so this movie had A lot to
live up to. Also, DC fans will love Dr. Amanda Waller&#x27;s cameo.
