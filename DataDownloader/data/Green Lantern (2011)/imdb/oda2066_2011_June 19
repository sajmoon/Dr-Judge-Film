Comical at best when it shouldn&#x27;t be. Ryan Reynolds seems to be
confused about how to portray the character. The special effects were
like a bad sci-fi from the 80s. The chemistry between characters was
unbelievable.<br /><br />The acting was not bad it just did not flow smoothly and the lines
sometimes seemed as though they were intended for elementary school
children. The movie would have been much better presented as more
realistic instead of cartoonish.<br /><br />I had so looked forward to this movie all year and found myself
laughing out loud throughout the whole movie. My husband fell asleep
halfway through it and started snoring. If you feel you must still see
this movie go to an early matin&#xE9;e so you don&#x27;t waste too much money.
