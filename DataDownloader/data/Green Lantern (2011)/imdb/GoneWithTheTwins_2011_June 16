The filmmakers are under the impression that audiences will accept
anything, as long as it&#x27;s drenched in special effects. Balls of gaseous
substances, electrical fields of lightning, pulsing rays of color,
billowing smoke, fiery explosions and glowing energy beams all shown
rapidly and accompanied by piercing noises &#x96; these tricks are sure to
impress even the most cynical critics. Unexplainable things happen all
of a sudden and viewers are expected to sit back and soak up the visual
zaniness without questioning all the cryptic events. This is simply not
true. For an origins movie, Green Lantern certainly has a lot more
explaining to do.<br /><br />For centuries, the emerald energy of willpower has been fueling
intergalactic peacekeepers known as Green Lanterns. Thousands of
specially chosen warriors and guardians police the galaxies, using
their unimaginable powers to quell the evil forces of fear. Legendary
legionnaire Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison), aglow with purplish,
translucent skin and rubbery tendons, discovers that an ancient
monstrosity called Parallax has been steadily growing and is
responsible for the recent deaths of several highly skilled Green
Lanterns. When he encounters the frightful anomaly firsthand, he&#x27;s
mortally wounded and must crash land on Earth.<br /><br />The viridian energy works in mysterious ways, and purposefully chooses
the individuals that harness its powers. When Abin dies, the ring he
possesses, recharged by a literal chartreuse lantern, seeks out
devil-may-care, foolhardy, hotheaded jet pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan
Reynolds, who hasn&#x27;t changed drastically from Van Wilder) to be its new
caretaker. At first he has no interest in assuming the responsibilities
of protecting a massive sector of civilization, but with the help of
negativistic ally Sinestro (Mark Strong), bulky alien Kilowog (Michael
Clarke Duncan) and bird-beaked mentor Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush), Hal
will become the most powerful Lantern of them all.<br /><br />From the very start, solemn narration, intrusive flashbacks and
countless tongue-twisting alien worlds, names and devices are utilized,
going overboard to stay faithful to the DC Comics characters and
entities. With such a swift running time, too much mindboggling content
is thrown at the screen rapidly. In the vein of Star Wars or Star Trek,
the ideas are completely science-fiction, working on a level closer to
Thor than Iron Man. Almost nothing is grounded in reality, and because
of this, little is deemed worthy of explanation. An &#x22;induction process&#x22;
allows for communication between the human and his newfound comrades,
along with quick acceptance of his lime green muscle suit, comical mask
(to protect his identity, despite merely covering his cheekbones), and
super powers. &#x22;The ring&#x27;s limits are only what you can imagine,&#x22;
insists Tomar-Re, making further definition pointless.<br /><br />A subplot with Dr. Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) is unnecessary and
wasted, the primary villain Parallax is built up to be invincible but
then casually discarded, and Hal&#x27;s love interest Carol Ferris (Blake
Lively, proving she can only play one character) is hopelessly generic.
It takes over an hour to devise a plot and forge an antagonist, and
just a few minutes to hastily resolve it all. Impressive makeup goes
the route of repulsive instead of awe-inspiring, and the costumes and
character designs follow suit, appearing absurd rather than impactful.<br /><br />While trying to stay true to the look of the original comic books,
Green Lantern has crafted some incredibly silly stuff. The visuals are
entirely too goofy for non-fans to readily digest. There&#x27;s also a huge
focus on responsibility, facing fears, and never giving up, which
passes as noticeably bland and uninteresting. Like Iron Man 2,
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Hellboy II: The Golden Army,
and most of the X-Men sequels, Green Lantern is a mishmash of outdated
graphic novel lore, reinvention, redesign, revival, adaptation, stale
humor and budget-busting special effects, all of which are an abrasive
assault to the senses and dolefully dreary filmmaking.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins
