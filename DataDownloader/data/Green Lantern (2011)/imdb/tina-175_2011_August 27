I was looking forward to seeing &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;. I really do enjoy a
good superhero movie and I have been a fan of the comic books for
years. It was a nice, decent movie, with good acting but there was
something that I felt was missing... I would have liked a little more
character development and a little less... eye candy from the visuals.<br /><br />The Good: Absolutely stunning visuals! Honestly, some of the best I
have ever seen!! Mark Strong was awesome as Sinestro, and Peter
Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond really did deliver!! Ryan Rennolds I
believe was perfect for the part of Hal Jordan and was quite convincing
and Blake Lively, well, she is pretty.<br /><br />The Bad: Character development was poor. Very little background story
and no chemistry between Hal and Carol. It was as if the film makers&#x27;
main focus were the graphics, which were pretty amazing to be honest.
The story was very straight forward, very Hollywood, with a cheesy
happy ending, no real plot and no twists. Parallax was not at all how I
thought he would be. I really expected the &#x22;bug&#x22; creature from the
comic but OK. It reminded me for the villain from Fantastic Four,
Gallactus, who consumed planets.<br /><br />All in all, a nice movie, an entertaining way to spend a couple of
hours but nothing more.
