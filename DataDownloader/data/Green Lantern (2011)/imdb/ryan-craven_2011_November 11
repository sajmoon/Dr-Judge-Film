Wow. Talented, competent director. A company coming off the back of 3
successful films. A well cast lead. What could go wrong? Everything,
apparently. What was Martin Johnson thinking when he read the script
for Green Lantern? Some alarm bells must have been ringing, or maybe
the paycheck was putting him off. That is the film&#x27;s gaping, obvious
problem...the script. Packed with lines that wouldn&#x27;t go amiss in a
spoof, Green Lantern tries so hard to take itself seriously, when
really, it&#x27;s just a kid. Starting off with a big, boring monologue
packing in thousands of comic book mythology in under 5 minutes, and a
thoroughly pointless scene showing Hal Jordan&#x27;s dad&#x27;s death, then 5
minutes later showing it again in the form of flashbacks, the film
never really recovers. Hal Jordan is a cocky flight pilot, who, with an
insane amount of luck, is chosen by a dying pink guy to become a green
lantern. The film&#x27;s villain is a big, messy blob (much like the film
itself) which runs on the yellow power of fear. Sound stupid to you?
Then don&#x27;t watch it. Ryan Reynolds gives likability and easy going
charm to Jordan, however his character doesn&#x27;t make for a convincing,
noble hero. All in all,a big, dirty stinker.
