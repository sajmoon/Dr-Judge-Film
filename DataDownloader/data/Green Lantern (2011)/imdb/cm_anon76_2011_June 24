I guess the moral of this movie is that some people, like Sinestro and
the Guardians, are uppity and won&#x27;t face their true feelings (because
of their pride). And also that a lowly human. like Hal Jordan, has no
secrets or pretensions and does not hide from his own fears. All this
secrecy and pride creates problems for Sinestro and the Guardians as
they are unable to face their own fear, but Hal Jordan is able to face
his fears and save the day.<br /><br />It sounds like an interesting plot, but this movie was just too
dumbed-down. Hal was probably the dumbest person in the movie. With the
exception of some of the villains he was also the most unheroic person
in the movie.<br /><br />Hal was kind of like the Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer of the Green
Lantern Corps, or Dumbo who flys with his ears.<br /><br />Tragically they spent a ton of money for this ugly-duckling story.
Special effects can make a movie more dramatic and epic, but Ryan
Reynolds&#x27;s character is earthly and mundane. The nature of his mundane
character may have actually sucked all of the epic-ness out of these
special effects.
