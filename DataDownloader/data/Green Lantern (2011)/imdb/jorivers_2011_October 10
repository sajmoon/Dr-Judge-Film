Nothing personal against Taika Waititi but his screen time is a
testament to how bad the screen play was for this film. Its a waste of
time. There was so much opportunity for a true development of
characters, story arch, rivalry anything of depth but instead the
writers insisted on filling the screen with buddy banter and fan-boy
blather. What this movie needed was less of Taika and Ryan chit
chatting about b.s and more time dealing with the demons that plague
every good hero. <br /><br />The pity is that there really is promise in this &#x27;franchise&#x27; the acting
is solid for all the lead characters. The FX were solid. I was very
impressed with Max Strong and Peter Sarsgaard and feel that if the next
project does get &#x22;green lit&#x22; it&#x27;ll need to be with a whole new writing
team to put those excellent nemesis portrayals to good use.
