This movie was refreshing and fun to watch. It may seem lame in the
trailer but when you see the whole movie its very enjoyably.Great CGI
but not the best, good and solid story acceptable acting and good film.
The editing is kind of lousy but is good enough. It stands out from the
majority of super-hero movies because is not as dramatic and is more
public in general than others such as Thor,X-Men:First Class or the
brilliant Batman The Dark Knight. When you see the whole movie I&#x27;m sure
you will say that wasn&#x27;t bad at all and as a Green Lantern Fan I may it
satisfied my not very high expectations with settings that are very
well done and look identical to the ones on the comic. WATCH THE GREEN
LANTERN!!!
