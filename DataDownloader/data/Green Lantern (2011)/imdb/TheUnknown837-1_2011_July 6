2011_July 6 
You know, it&#x27;s been a pretty bad time at the movies for me this year.
Oh sure, there have been some good new releases at the cinema such as
&#x22;Unknown&#x22; and &#x22;The Adjustment Bureau&#x22; but we&#x27;re now more than halfway
through the year and a good portion of the movies of 2011 have been
total duds. And joining the accumulation of instantly-forgettables is
&#x22;Green Lantern,&#x22; the latest of an exhausted trend of overproduced comic
book-to-screen transitions. Here we have a movie with a potentially
engaging premise, a good cast, and a very talented and accomplished
director and yet it succeeded at being nothing to me other than a waste
of time.<br /><br />It&#x27;s all been seen before. The egotistical protagonist, the
misunderstood dweeb who becomes a villain, the secret organization
unbeknownst to the public, etcetera, etcetera. This time Ryan Reynolds
gets the unoriginal leading part, playing a high-on-himself Air Force
test pilot who (by strange circumstances) discovers an alien ship
crash-landed by the sea. When the pink-fleshed pilot of the pod
expires, Mr. Reynolds takes a strange green ring from around his finger
and a lantern from his ship and finds himself &#x22;chosen&#x22; with a special
assortment of powers controlled by his will and diminished by his fear.<br /><br />At least that&#x27;s the mumbo-jumbo the movies throws in place of a plot
dynamic.<br /><br />The director of &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; was Martin Campbell, who recently made
&#x22;Edge of Darkness&#x22; and the marvelously entertaining &#x22;Casino Royale&#x22; and
I am quite appalled that a director of his stature went so willingly
with a movie that evidently thought it was either still a comic book or
a video game. From start to finish, it is really nothing more than a
display of the range of images that computers can generate, something
that I stopped being wowed by ages ago.<br /><br />Yes, Hollywood, wet get it! Computers can produce cool images! Once
upon a time, you were more focused upon telling good stories. And to be
honest, the computer graphics are not that spectacular. From time to
time, I saw a couple of special effects shots that were quite
impressive but most of the time, despite their detail, I was not
convinced. The purple-skinned alien seen at the beginning of the movie
in particular is a very cartoony effect; I never felt like I could
reach out and touch him or the world he was in.<br /><br />And the movie is so oversaturated with special effects that aren&#x27;t as
dazzling as they should be that it makes the sketchy characters and
plot seem even more flimsy than they already are. Mr. Reynolds is a
very talented actor with a lot of movie star quality, but he has zip to
work with here. He&#x27;s the same troubled, egomaniac that we&#x27;ve seen a
thousand times before just toned down. Way down. And even though he and
the very lovely and talented Blake Lively have some sexy moments
together, there isn&#x27;t any real chemistry between them. None of the
aliens are particularly interesting; the confines of their world and
organization are just barely touched upon. One of the aliens was voiced
by Geoffrey Rush and I had more fun trying to guess his name while
listening to his voice than deciphering any of the mumbo jumbo that
emanated from the CGI alien&#x27;s fish-like lips. Nothing ever built up
enough for me to really care about anything that happened.<br /><br />But here&#x27;s the defining example of lazy screen writing. Early on in the
movie, we have a drawn-out scene with Mr. Reynolds and his nephew. A
close call occurred earlier before and his nephew is quite upset. The
movie hints at a father-and-son figure dynamic developing here and
right after this introductory moment, it just stops. We never see or
hear of the nephew again. Not once. He and the context of his character
in the plot are just dropped.<br /><br />Now I have to be honest, the movie does garner a little momentum in the
third act. The special effects become buttoned-up, the action becomes
more engaging, and things take a turn for the better. But that only
lasts the better part of twenty minutes in a two-hour movie. And when
it was all over and done and the credits had started rolling and I
noticed that all of the other people in the auditorium had already
flocked for the exit, I found it no surprise that &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; had
made less than half of his two hundred-million-dollar budget back.
