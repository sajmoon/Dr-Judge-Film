2011_June 26 
Being part of the new generation, I though it would be nice to see a
new Green Lantern movie, particularly the one with Hal Jordan. He
didn&#x27;t come back in to comic spotlight until &#x22;Rebirth&#x22;, &#x22;In Brightest
Day&#x22;, and &#x22;In Blackest Night&#x22; The haters are saying that this movie
dragged, it was boring and it had no acting worthy of praising. Well,
from a fan of many genres I was pretty open minded of this movie. Well,
yes it dragged, only in a few scenes, bu they&#x27;re barely noticeable, the
movie was short and rushed but boring, NOT AT ALL. It was action
packed, fresh, and fun to watch. I have read some reviews that it is
good enough to replace the Harry Potter series. It&#x27;s not good enough
for that really, but it&#x27;s good enough to outshine some of the deemed
&#x22;horrible&#x22; movies of 2011. The acting was actually pretty fitting.
Blake Lively was unbelievable as a pilot, only because she looked to
fragile and pretty to be that kind of character. She looked like she
has someone else piloting for her. But her acting was very fitting.
Ryan Reynolds totally OWNED Hal Jordan. He played the character so
well, that I can&#x27;t imagine him as Flash, or any other DC character. I
hope he plays Deadpool as good as he did Hal. <br /><br />Anyways don&#x27;t expect Pacino acting or X-men First class Grandeur.
Expect memorable acting, great special effects, , eye candy, and its
basically a fun family film with hidden dark undertones. It&#x27;s Grandeur
is similar to that of the new karate kid movie,(take that anyway as you
may, but that movie was very enjoyable). So please if you want to watch
a good summer movie, watch Green Lantern. But, not in 3D, it seldom
shows it&#x27;s 3D worthy. So, good movie, not an epic, but sure as hell
entertaining.<br /><br />p.s: extra scene after the credits.
