Every trend in the movies goes through the same motions. They come out
of left field when no one thought it would be a viable idea, then
instantly becoming the most watched genre in years, finally over-
extending itself to the point of pure silver screen saturation and the
profits nose dive off the celluloid cliff. You can usually mark the
first movie going over the edge by how far it pushes the genre out
beyond the norm. For fans of the comic book genre, even knowing that
Iron Man 3, Captain America and The Avengers are still on their way,
this weekends superhero offering gave many pause, wondering if this was
one spandex&#x27;d crusader too many. Did the curtain begin to fall?<br /><br />Nope. Not quite yet.<br /><br />Green Lantern tells the story of Hal Jordan, a reckless flyboy who is
chosen by a magical ring to protect his planet from destruction. Never
one to follow through on anything, Jordan must struggle to discover the
hero he never imagined was waiting inside.<br /><br />I was going to start with some of the struggles and hardships that this
story and script had to work through, but really, let&#x27;s get down to the
green, glowing tacks here&#x85;Ryan Reynolds. He is not just playing a
superhero, the man actually is one. No matter how bad the dialogue, no
matter how convoluted the script, no matter what crazy situation you
put him in, his charm and nearly flawless ease on screen allows him to
raise that bar a little higher. I&#x27;m not saying that all these things
were necessarily terrible here, but they could have been and Reynolds
still would have found a way to make it work. Following his career
since the Van Wilder days, Reynolds has never failed to enliven each
and every project and provide at least one or two solid moments of wit
and enjoyment on screen. For his generation of actors, I believe he is
the closest they will get to George Clooney, a man who can truly
balance comedy, action and drama all while looking like he was born to
play that part.<br /><br />Now that we have that out of the way, back to the problems. With all
the comic book movies capturing the audiences recently, most are
earth-bound or at least set mostly in an environment we can all easily
recognize. Thor was the first in the new battalion of superhero flicks
to test the waters of magical landscapes and far away universes and it
succeeded fairly well. Without that preceding it, Green Lantern might
have suffered more by spending so much time in outer space, but Thor
built a bridge to that arena (and then busted it at the end of the
movie&#x85;*in- joke*) so Green Lantern flew right over and pushed even
farther out into the cosmos. Instead, the surrounding characters and
subplots became the weakest links. Sadly the first half of the movie
had to do so much of the heavy lifting: establishing the universe,
literally, and giving some foundation for all these new and outlandish
creatures, while still getting enough time to bring in their human
counterparts back home. Peter Sarsgaard pulled out some decent angst
and rage, but was never given enough time to really fuel the fire. Even
worse was Blake Lively, who was given absolutely no room to breathe in
a virtually lifeless character. Her introduction as a fellow fighter
pilot was painfully unnecessary and forced her to try and work her way
back into relevancy, which might have worked if given time, but she
really wasn&#x27;t. As for the arch-villain CGI cloud creature, Parallax,
the effects were impressive, but the story behind him felt flawed and
unstable, so he never brought a whole lot of weight or tension to the
scenes.<br /><br />Overall, I still give this a five rating because it brings us back to
those true summertime carefree flicks that didn&#x27;t try to give more than
we bargained for. People who say this is a failure because it isn&#x27;t
Dark Knight are making unfair and outlandish comparisons. Director
Martin Campbell (who helmed two of the more successful recent Bond
chapters, Goldeneye and Casino Royale) wasn&#x27;t going for grit and bones,
he wanted light, fun and entertaining for the few moments he had you
trapped in the theater. In that context, and with the effortless
abilities of Ryan Reynolds, they achieved their goal, albeit one set
far lower than what audiences may have envisioned.<br /><br />The End of the Page recommendation: Green Lantern may hold a little
more light for the comic book enthusiast, but for the mainstream
moviegoer, this is only a mildly flickering flame, not a bright light
of the summer.
