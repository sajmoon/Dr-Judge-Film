2012_January 2 
Just watched the Green Lantern movie, after having failed to watch it
through a few months ago. Of my opinion it was fine to watch, obviously
not keeping you at the edge of your seat or something you can watch on
a repeat more than once through the week or month. Yet I felt this was
the same with the first Iron man movie, it was the &#x22;origin story&#x22; and
you had to give some leeway for less action (although there was fights
through Green lantern anyway, something Iron Man (1) lacked). As for
the idea they may or may not be making a second one due to bad box
office reception and only just making over $100 million, the story
pretty much follows Iron Man, the first one was not welcome completely,
the second one kicked ass and people loved it including myself, so I
would be all for having a second green lantern film too especially
since they gave you a little hint at the end of the first one what
might just be happening (though I will give no spoilers). My only
begrudges are 1) Ryan Reynolds was also Deadpool, but that will hardly
matter as DC and Marvel are separate franchises and as long as they
don&#x27;t try to make a Deadpool movie at the same time as a Green Lantern,
Reynolds wont have to make a choice between the two 2) The CGI, I know
there was a lot of bad commentary of questionable looks of the costume
used in this, to be specific the mask worn by Hal Jordan (Reynolds) and
I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing a little change done to it to make it more a
material &#x22;costume&#x22; rather than a glowing suit.<br /><br />Thanks for reading those who actually made it so far. Please give it a
chance when you watch it yourselves.
