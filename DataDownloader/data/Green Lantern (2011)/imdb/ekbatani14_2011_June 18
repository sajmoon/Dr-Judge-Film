Green Lantern was a film that I have been looking forward to for years.
After seeing this movie I can say that a reboot is already needed. The
development of the movie has been through a lot; after months of
speculation that Ryan Gosling was set to play Green Lantern, Ryan
Reynolds was cast instead, who simply had the &#x22;body&#x22; of a superhero.
Reynolds personality simply did not fit the persona of Hal Jordan/Green
Lantern. His frequent wise cracks just did not work with this type of
hero, and the movie was just too concentrated on him physically. What I
hated the most was that the Green Lantern suit was all CGI, Reynolds
was not actually wearing a real suit during the movie. <br /><br />In terms of the overall plot of the movie, it was lacking too much
depth. The origins of the story was too focused on Green Lanterns in
general, and not on Hal Jordan himself. In fact, there was only one
scene of Hal Jordan&#x27;s past, and one scene of Hal with his family. The
story would have been more powerful if we could learn more about his
origins and why he was so &#x22;destined&#x22; to wear the Green Lantern Ring.<br /><br />In looking at the positives of the movie, Blake Lively was smoking hot
and made a decent performance as Carol Ferris. Mark Strong was
EXCELLENT as Sinestro. He plays as Green Lantern&#x27;s mentor, but also
maintains the evil villain that we all knows lives inside of him. Peter
Sarsgaard tried way too hard with Dr. Hector Hammond&#x27;s character. As a
Green Lantern fan I was questioning what the whole point of the
character was in terms of the plot. Sarsgaard&#x27;s character has multiple
scenes where he is making uncomfortable moaning sounds, which was all
but dramatic. Overall the film was a disappointment, and the upcoming
new Superman and Batman movies will have to save DC comics.
