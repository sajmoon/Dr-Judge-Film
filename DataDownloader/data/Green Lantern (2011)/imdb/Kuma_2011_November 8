Well... as an action flick Green Lantern was interesting... I guess.
The film seemed choppy, as if they edited large scenes out of the movie
and didn&#x27;t bother to film new scenes that gave shorter explanation as
to what just happened. As someone who&#x27;s never actually ready the comics
it was interesting, but to go up against an enemy that is never true
defeatable such as fear, the ending seemed rather anti-climatic as
impossible. Fear is never defeated on conquered in a situation, it
always has the chance of coming up in power again.<br /><br />As for actor choices, I like Ryan Reynold he&#x27;s a cute guy but I
personally preferred a African American as green lantern, its just a
better choice in my view. I can&#x27;t really take Ryan Reynold seriously as
a super hero.... especially when he&#x27;s just a cute face and sexy body to
make the rom-coms actually succeed.<br /><br />As for Blake lively, got to say I like her better as a blonde. I
enjoyed her performance, but found her character and the script to be
highly lacking.<br /><br />But am I wrong or is the red dude supposed to be the bad guy.... a
little lost there. But I&#x27;m sure it will all be explained when some big
company decides to make a crummy sequel.
