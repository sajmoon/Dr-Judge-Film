I saw Green Lantern with my son because it looked safe enough and I
used to collect the comic books when I was a kid. I felt like I was the
only guy over 20 at the theater, which I guess isn&#x27;t surprising
anymore. Did think there would be more adults, however, because the
Green Lantern was something we read in my generation. Not sure if it&#x27;s
even around anymore. Being a fan of the comic book I had to go see it,
and I was intrigued with the movie. After I got home I jumped on the
computer and read the reviews. I was very disappointed with the
professional reviews that cast stones at it, while at the same time,
regular folk like myself thought it was a pretty good stab at the DC
comic book version. I guess I look for something different when I go to
the movies. I go to unwind and enjoy myself for a couple of hours, and
Green Lantern worked for me.
