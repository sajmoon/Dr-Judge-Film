All I can say is that I was extremely impressed with this film. Based
on the trailers, I was expecting this film to be mediocre, I was wrong.
In my opinion, for a superhero film to work, it all narrows down to
special effects and the acting. For this movie, both are great. This
movie may not have been as good as X-men: First Class or The Dark
Knight, but it is an above average superhero movie. Ryan Reynolds is
good as always and Mark Strong delivered a strong performance as well.
This movie is heavy on special effects and they are SPECTACULAR. The
dialogue is nothing new but don&#x27;t expect it to be excellent given the
fact that its a superhero movie. Overall, this movie was very well done
and I liked it a whole lot more than I thought it would. Hopefully this
may be the first of many Green Lantern movies because this has the
potential to become a great movie franchise.
