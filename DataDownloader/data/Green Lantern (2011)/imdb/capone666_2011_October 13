Green Lantern<br /><br />Having your super-powers derive from a magical ring means that if you
ever take it off to do the dishes, and it falls down the drain, your
career is over.<br /><br />The super hero in this action movie, however, doesn&#x27;t fear the
consequences, or anything else.<br /><br />When a dying alien from an intergalactic police force bestows Hal (Ryan
Reynolds) with a special ring, he involuntarily becomes the first human
member of the Green Lantern Corp.<br /><br />Under the tutelage of the leader (Mark Strong) and other Lanterns
(Geoffrey Rush, Michael Clarke Duncan), Hal learns to control the
green-essence powered ring in hopes of defeating the fear-absorbing
organism that killed his predecessor.<br /><br />Thanks to a weak script and overblown effects, this cornball comic-book
movie based on the DC Comics character is unable to transition from
funny pages to feature film successfully.<br /><br />Furthermore, having a colour in your codename really limits your
wardrobe choices. (Red Light)
