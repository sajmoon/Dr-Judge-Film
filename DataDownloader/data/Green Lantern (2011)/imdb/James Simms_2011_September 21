Just came back from the theater and now I&#x27;m going to give my two cents
on it... After reading the negative reviews that were posted by the
mainstream critics (If I should dare call them critics) I actually had
my worries but I decided to stick to my guns and go forward with what
my opinions were going to be and to my surprise everything turn out
exactly as I predicted... And that was the critics were wrong!!!
Possibly exaggerated! <br /><br />The film was as good as it&#x27;s worth and actually lived up to the
trailers and hype that eventually lead the film up to. Of course it did
had it&#x27;s flaws aleast just a few but could easily be over looked and
one of the flaws was that it was abit grounded in which I don&#x27;t find
that a bad thing since I for one was expecting it to be since this
meant to be the first among many films to come. It&#x27;s understandable
that viewers and fans were expecting a more space opera like theme but
I believe we might get more of that in sequels since thats what there
for! I for one started enjoying it as the film goes on till I finally
come the conclusion that after the end of the movie that I had three
words lurking in my head and those words were... I, LIKE, IT!!! The
Good: Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan, the visuals, the action, the other
Lanterns (Abin Sur, Tomar-Re, Kilawog &#x26; Sinestro), Hector Hammond &#x26;
Parallax and the forge of the yellow power ring.<br /><br />The Flaws: It&#x27;s slightly grounded, not much screen time for the other
Lanterns especially against Parallax and short of a space opera like
theme. This is one film that even hardcore fans would &#x26; should enjoy
and appreciate for what it&#x27;s worth and the execs of the WB should be
patting themselves in the back for actually taking the time from
keeping their heads inside their asses to actually taking them out and
do what they should have done in the first place and that is giving
other DC heroes (Aside from Superman &#x26; Batman) their chance to shine on
the silver screen and hope the same can be done for other DC heroes to
come!
