when the first trailer of this movie appeared I thought that this was
going to be by far the worst movie of the year. I don&#x27;t like very much
ryan reynolds in a leading role and the special effects looked very
poor, at some point very close to ridiculous. The first 20 minutes of
the movie got me into the story ( I was expecting nothing else than bad
frankly) but this was a huge surprise. Characters are well developed, I
liked so much when Blake Lively tells Green Lantern to take off the
mask but there is a symbolism there since she talks about the mask of
fear, there are very deep concepts in this movie,peter saarsgard is
simply phenomenal as a villain and basically all the actors are amazing
at their roles in the end it was worth it. Yes the special effects are
poor sometimes and for that I would give a 4 but then acting script and
pace are great so that makes a 10: final score 8
