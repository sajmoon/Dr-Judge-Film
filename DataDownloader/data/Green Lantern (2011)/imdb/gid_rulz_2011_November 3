A great comic, An entertaining up and coming actor, A good director and
a strong supportive cast, this movie should have been one of the movies
of the year, but it just made to many mistakes. <br /><br />Comic book movies have gone from pretty average to highly entertaining
over the last 3-5 years, with Nolan&#x27;s Batmans, The Incredible Hulk,
Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, X-men first class and many more. Green
Lantern on the other hand falls way to short. There was a lot wrong
with this movie and not much that went right. <br /><br />The main issue was the CGI. Now CGI has become unnecessarily used at
time in movies over the last few years and it has come to the belief
that if you throw in heaps of CGI and cool effects the movie will be
great, well look at transformers and that should answer that theory.
Not only is the CGI overused in this movie but it is really poor, it
makes the whole thing go from what is meant to be a serious comic book
film and adds so much colour you think it is just a comedy without the
jokes. Also this is a movie with a huge budget, why not spend maybe a
few hundred on making Reynolds a real suit instead of digitally
applying to him, it makes him seem ridiculous.<br /><br />The Villain plot in this was also a real let down. The whole storyline
went through so quickly that it made me thinking their must be either a
really cool villain about to come or this is a bad movie, turns out it
was the latter. <br /><br />Credit does go to Ryan Reynolds though for being bearable throughout
the film, it isn&#x27;t his fault this was a terrible movie.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were high or maybe this was bad, but this has put
a very bad name to the name of Green Lantern and if they want to have
another crack at it write a good plot and focus on making it good
instead of what cool things you can make on a computer. 3/10
