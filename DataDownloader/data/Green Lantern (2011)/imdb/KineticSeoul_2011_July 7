2011_July 7 
To start with I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of The Green Lantern in comic books
or was hyped to see the movie when I saw the trailer for this
superhero. He does have a pretty cool super power and all, but just
didn&#x27;t find this character all that fascinating. Maybe it&#x27;s because I
had pretty much low expectations of this movie, since I heard many
negative things about this movie. But it wasn&#x27;t all that bad, even the
script had been better and less predictable it would have been much
better. But this is a decent superhero movie that has some fun scenes
and I actually enjoyed watching this movie to some degree. This isn&#x27;t a
great superhero movie but for the most part it really is passable. The
main flaw though is how predictable most of it is and some parts just
seemed kinda lame, the script just wasn&#x27;t all that interesting. The
action sequences however and the special effects were well done for the
most part and the acting is decent as well. The way it shows the
superhero and villains powers was entertaining because it&#x27;s actually
sort of creative and fast paced. This is basically the origin story for
Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern(Ryan Reynolds) and it&#x27;s a decent start if
this becomes a franchise.<br /><br />6.9/10
