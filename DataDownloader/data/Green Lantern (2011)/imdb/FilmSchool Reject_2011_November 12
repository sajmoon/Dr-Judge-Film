INTRO:<br /><br />As this is an origins story, we can expect the hero&#x27;s background, his
environment conditions - both physical and psychological. And mostly
the events that lead to his attainment of super hero power and the
impact it had on him and others around him... I am not saying that only
this is a correct format -- in fact I strongly advice against any
&#x27;format / formula&#x27; based movies. But this is what movie tries to do in
unsurprising, boring, illogical ways.<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />Our hero, Hal Jordan / Green Lantern (Ryan Reynolds), is reckless,
irresponsible and a womanizer. But he has a rare talent in Air Combat
flying. Okay lets think this over, does this sound any familiar? If you
have seen ANY comic book based movie most of the traits look all too
familiar. But the movie never claims to be original. Actually it may be
a comic book based film clich&#xE9;. Indeed we should appreciate (?) that
movie mostly stays true to the comic book.<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Hal Jordon&#x27;s character is acceptable to the extent that he doesn&#x27;t try
too much to emphasize his irresponsible behavior or his sudden acquired
sense of responsibility. Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), is his colleague,
also they shared a intimate relationship but broke later, which is
attributed to his irresponsibility. Carol Ferris character seems to be
too casual, having almost no credibility in the plot.<br /><br />You will be surprised to the reaction of Hal Jordans friend and Carol
Ferris once they find out he has super powers. Their reaction? Nothing,
really - they just say its cool. Thats it. They don&#x27;t feel like real
characters. But this kind of helped the movie pace through its course.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard&#x27;s character is dealt very good. His slow raise into a
villain helped the script focus on the raise of our hero, Hal Jordon.<br /><br />Mark Strong is Sinestro, a skeptical Green Lantern. He didn&#x27;t indulge
much in giving unnecessary inspirational speech to superhero as other
stereotypes would have. He played an integral part in reflecting Hal
Jordan state. <br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds had done a nice job. He&#x27;s physique and everything just
added up to his role. Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond is also
convincing. In fact he&#x27;s just in home with the whole creepy yellow
villain thing. Marks Strong, as Sinestro is cynical and skeptical of
Hal Jordan and he really convinced in screen that he is.<br /><br />TECHNICAL:<br /><br />Being, a super hero movie, the film can be attributed to excellent
production values. If there is one thing where Hollywood can&#x27;t be beat,
it is CGI... Green Lantern is no exception. But it would be even more
awesome if Green Lantern Crops HQ Planet was given even more attention
(remember Asgard in THOR ?). Other than that there are no complaints.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Do not expect original plot, dynamic characterizations or mind numbing
twists... Just sit back and enjoy sporadic humor and the CGI, so that
you may not be disappointed.<br /><br />Its high time these new super hero movie should look beyond the
commercial formulas and safe side tactics. This film would have been
awesome if the calculated commercial elements are done away in favor of
originality and creativity... But every super hero movie can&#x27;t be a
Dark Knight... or is it possible? We will see, as another sequel of
Green Lantern is on its way!!<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: 6/10
