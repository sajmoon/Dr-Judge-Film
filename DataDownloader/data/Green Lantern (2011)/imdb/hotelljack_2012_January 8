GREEN LATERN--There are enough detailed reviews. I just want to say
that even the &#x22;Rotten Tomatoes&#x22; ratings can be wrong sometimes. They
gave a rating in the 20% range for Green Latern but I thought the movie
was well done and I enjoyed it. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble accepting
Ryan Reynolds as Green Latern and Green Latern was one of my favorite
comic book characters when I was growing up.<br /><br />I could have wished for more action and interaction with other fellow
Green Laterns but the ones who were presented were so well done that
each additional Green Latern character might have run the risk of
presenting one not up to par with the others.
