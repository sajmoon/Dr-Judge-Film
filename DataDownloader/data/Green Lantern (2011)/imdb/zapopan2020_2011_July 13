C&#x27;mon, you in fact knew it!, felt it coming, but still can&#x27;t accept
that ...when the studios DECIDE TO INVEST IN A SUPERHEROES movie it&#x27;s
not for the true fans, or for the generations of people who know who
GRREN- LANTERN is, it&#x27;s for other reasons....<br /><br />REVIEW: <br /><br />&#x22;Summer movie for kids&#x22; oh and forgot..for merchandise vendors.<br /><br />&#x22;The mystic of the good FANTASY TO SCREEN gets lost in THE BIG BUDGET.<br /><br />&#x22;This is the TEMPLATE STORY of any other SUPERHEROE agree, but very
childly put. <br /><br />&#x22;The public have grown up, we want more S T O R Y..yesss like in &#x22;Toy-
Story&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;I was really looking forward for this one...sniff
