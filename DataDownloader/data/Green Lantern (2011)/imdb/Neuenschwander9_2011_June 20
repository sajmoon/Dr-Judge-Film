Oh wow! we get strange looking aliens that when they talk their voices
sound super slowed down. Their helmets are in the shape of rooster
beaks and look hilarious; such clever and interesting dialogue! The
scenes were all obviously shot with the utmost care and attention to
detail. And the music could rival Mozart! The acting, especially on the
children&#x27;s part, was superb and professionally done; the story was
original and the well thought out dialogue allowed the actors to show
their best performance. This movie should have seriously been
considered for movie of the year.<br /><br />Before I go on, I will acknowledge that perhaps Warner Bros. wanted to
appeal to a wider audience. I know that a lot of kids enjoyed the movie
and I can respect that.<br /><br />However I am quite certain that those children who enjoyed this movie
could have been just as, if not more entertained by a better-made Green
Lantern film that didn&#x27;t suck.<br /><br />There are no words that exist in the English language that can express
just how awful this movie was. I regret that I spent $17.25 and about
two hours, which I will never get back, to watch this movie. Even the
Green Lantern animated series has far more quality and intelligence
than this waste of $100 million. Hell, I&#x27;d say the same for the Green
LanternTV series with Adam Gillart.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t even know why anyone would want to rent or buy this movie on
video. If you have a copy of this video (or DVD), do not toss it aside
lightly. Instead, throw it with great force, preferably into an
incinerator. The world will be a better place for it.
