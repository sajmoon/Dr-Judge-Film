The critics can say whatever they&#x27;d like to about this adaptation of
the DC Comics character, but it was actually a very good movie. While I
will say I think the pacing moved a bit too quickly, not allowing all
characters to be fully developed, that is the film&#x27;s only real
downfall.<br /><br />Honestly, when I first heard about them making a movie about Green
Lantern, I was a bit skeptical. Not because of the movie itself, but
because, as much as I love Ryan Reynolds as an actor, he always does a
phenomenal job, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d feel completely comfortable with him
playing a superhero. After seeing the movie, though, all doubts were
lost. Reynolds made for a perfect Hal Jordan! The story follows Jordan,
a test pilot, who has a mystical ring, which possesses great powers,
bestowed upon him by an alien. He is told that the ring chose him to
induct into an intergalactic squadron who is tasked with keeping peace
throughout the universe.<br /><br />A good majority of characters and locations in the film are done in CGI
and I have to say that they were spectacular! As Hal is introduced to
this new planet and these &#x27;creatures,&#x27; we, too, experience it as if
through his eyes. It is a magnificent universe that has something new
and breathtaking to see around every corner! It was just a totally
unique world.. unlike any you&#x27;ve seen in a film before, only aided by
the voice talent that brought some of these aliens to life, such as
Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan.<br /><br />Along with an incredible performance by Reynolds, Peter Sarsgaard did a
wonderful job as Hector Hammond who was accidentally introduced to
remarkable power (in true comic book fashion) which consumed him purely
for evil.<br /><br />I, now, look forward to seeing the sequel (which is currently in the
works) to explore more of this incredible universe and see what
excitement still lies ahead.
