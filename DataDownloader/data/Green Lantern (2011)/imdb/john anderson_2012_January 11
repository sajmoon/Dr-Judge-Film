a budget of 200 mil.for some,enough said.let us accept that no one
imagined RR in the lead role of the green lantern.the problem with the
movie though is something else.i feel it took a lot of time to really
tell the viewers about what it wanted to project.maybe,just maybe, a
keanu reeves in the lead role may have brought the color and attitude
to the character.Blake lively as the smart yet subtle girl was
definitely not best cast.PETER was brilliant but then it was expected.i
feel the screenplay was above decent but the problem was the awkward
direction which has not been seen in superhero movies often.there was
something wrong with the pace too.coming out in year which also
released excellently made X MEN FIRST CLASS AND CAPTAIN America,GREEN
LANTERN lags way behind.again,i say,better casting could have made a
huge difference.
