Three months ago I watched the animated movie that covers essentially
the same story, that of the hot-shot, sometimes irresponsible American
test pilot that gets recruited into the Green Latern Corps, the several
thousand who each have a sector of the universe to protect.<br /><br />Here we get real people telling the story. Ryan Reynolds is the focus
as test pilot Hal Jordan. He is flying a test mission to help
demonstrate the advantages of a new fighter plane when he pulls a very
risky move and ends up destroying the plane. Soon after he is pulled
into the presence of a dying Green Lantern, who tells him &#x22;the ring has
chosen you.&#x22; When he is transported to the secret location, in a far
corner of the universe, he is met with much skepticism. <br /><br />All the other green lanterns are from races much older than the human
race, and they doubt that an Earthling human has what it takes. This of
course provides the drama for Hal&#x27;s quest to prove himself and become
what our comic books refer to as the Green Lantern.<br /><br />A large obstacle is the evil monster of sorts that is absorbing the
energy of others and in the process growing more powerful. Unstopped it
would destroy the universe as we know it. Hal needs to become the hero
that stops the monster and in the process earning his status.<br /><br />Good movie, I enjoyed it.
