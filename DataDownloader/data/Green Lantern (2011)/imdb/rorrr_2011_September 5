The plot and the script are stupid. I&#x27;m not exaggerating, they are
completely dumb. I haven&#x27;t read the original comic book, but there&#x27;s
simply no excuse to have something so mind numbing, so predictable, so
simplistic, so clich&#xE9;. Was this made for young kids? I was so bored, I
couldn&#x27;t believe what I was watching.<br /><br />If this is a sci-fi movie, they definitely cut all the science parts
out. &#x22;Green energy of will&#x22;, &#x22;yellow energy of fear&#x22; - who came up with
this bulls**t, a five year old?<br /><br />And of course, all the good characters must be beautiful, and all the
bad characters must be ugly with crappy voices, or otherwise viewers
like us would never figure it out. So disrespectful.
