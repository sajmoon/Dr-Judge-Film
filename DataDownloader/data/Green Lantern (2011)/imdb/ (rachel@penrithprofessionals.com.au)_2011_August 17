last Friday night my husband and i went to the movies to see green
lantern. i must say Ryan Reynolds does look rather good in tight green
skin! it was a typical super hero movie with the reluctant hero and the
super Bad Dude who was once a good guy but it was entertaining. my
husband is more the DC and Marvel man and he still thought it was good,
though for die-hard comic book fans apparently Ryan plays Hal Jordan a
bit too light hearted; the character was more serious in previous
renditions. <br /><br />it was in my opinion still a bit dark in places for younger kids, and
my ten year old will be waiting a couple of years yet before he gets to
see it. all in all, an enjoyable night out and the verdict is split if
Blake Lively was any good. I would say average at best but with a super
thin figure. Enjoy.
