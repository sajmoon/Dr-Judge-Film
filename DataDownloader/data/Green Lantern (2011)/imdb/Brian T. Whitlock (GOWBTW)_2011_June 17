Finally, a DC Comic character I have always enjoyed reading since I was
a kid. We had &#x22;Superman&#x22; on the big screen, &#x22;Wonder Woman&#x22; on TV, seen
&#x22;SuperFriends&#x22; and &#x22;Justice League&#x22; in cartoons. Well, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;
has come and I enjoyed it very well. Ryan Reynolds plays the character
Hal Jordan, a test pilot who happens to be the &#x22;chosen one&#x22;, the wearer
of the Power Ring which the Green Lantern wields to uphold the laws of
the universe. The predecessor was Abin Sur, who was attacked by
Parallax: a off-world menace who feeds on the fear of others. In the
Green Lantern Corps, there are lots of other members: Killowog, got a
lot of attitude, Tomar-Re shows kindness, and Sinestro shows a lot of
arrogance. Back on Earth, Hal shows his skills to Carol Ferris(Blake
Lively), a fellow pilot and encourages Hal on being more responsible as
a Green Lantern. I liked the way this movie was made. The special
effects and the graphics are totally awesome! This movie is best seen
in 3D! The die-hard comic fan must see this movie, you wouldn&#x27;t be
disappointed. 2.5 out of 5 stars!
