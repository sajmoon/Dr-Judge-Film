this film is the most unthoughtful dreary and horrific piece of
illogical nonsense, nothing makes sense , it looks like something they
are trying to bribe you with .... we know its crap so we will stick
lots of these special effects that look awful to win you over..... well
you didn&#x27;t ..it was terrible, the only people that seem to like this
are comic book fans who always start with i read this comic 20 years
ago - IRRELEVANCE ! just because there is a comic book about the green
lantern doesn&#x27;t make the film any better or save it in any way ... its
a disaster zone no where near a 6 whoever gave it that are dreaming it
isn&#x27;t worth a single mark ! Director should be hanging himself for this
film.... did the people involve actually sit in a premier and say wow
yeaa that was great ! fools
