First The GOOD:<br /><br />The graphics in the film were some of the best I had seen. The ultra
villain was very very cool looking, of course I saw it in 3D so that
probably helped. The Green Lantern was very cool looking. My favorite
part of the movie is when Hal Jordan visited the other planets. <br /><br />Also the entire supporting cast is what I thought carried the film,
minus the leading lady. The other Lanterns, the lead Lantern
especially, of course all these other Lanterns was really a testament
to the CG. <br /><br />Now The BAD:<br /><br />Unfortunately, everything else. Ryan Reynolds was.... Ryan Reynolds
(think Van Wilder). So he wasn&#x27;t acting he was playing himself, playing
The Green Lantern. It was really hard to care anything about &#x27;Hal
Jordon&#x27; at all because I felt like I never saw what Hal Jordan was
supposed to be. <br /><br />The story or plot also felt very rushed, the epic battle in the end was
over before it began, or at least it felt that way. With such an epic
villain, you would think the final fight would be just as epic. Thank
god I saw this movie in 3D! The female lead had a story-line that
wasn&#x27;t developed very well or maybe she had crappy lines to work with,
either way she didn&#x27;t work almost as much as Ryan Reynolds didn&#x27;t work.<br /><br />Overall I was really impressed with the look of the film hugely
disappointed with the main characters. I thought all other supporting
class kept me engaged with what the story was supposed to be. So don&#x27;t
expect too much this is Comic book movie does NOT belong in the same
realms as, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Thor and the IronMans.
