Green Lantern (2011- 105 mins) Ryan Reynolds, Mark Strong, Blake
Lively, PEter Sarsgaard There have been very few times lately where I
have gone to the movies and I was just giddy to see the movie. I have
been wanting to see a ton of movies in the last few years but the only
one&#x27;s that I have nearly lost sleep the night before I went were &#x22;Lord
of the Rings&#x22; and the first installment of the &#x22;Transformers&#x22;
franchise. This was one of those occasions. Growing up I had been a
HUGE lover of the Green Lantern and the Green Lantern Corps comics, so
this both was one I couldn&#x27;t wait to see but also one that had some
lofty expectations in my mind to fill. Sometimes movies like these
deliver on exactly what you want (LOTR and 1st Transformers) and
sometimes they are &#x22;ok&#x22; but not mind blowing (2nd Transformers). This
was INDEED one of those times where the whole movie met my expectations
and then some. I had a giddy kid grin on my face the whole time I was
in the theater and still as I sit here thinking of the movie I am just
amazed at the effects (especially the planet Oa) and acting (especially
Reynolds and Strong) and cannot wait to hear the news of them starting
to film part 2.<br /><br />So for those living under a rock for the last 5 months and haven&#x27;t
either seen the 1000 trailers on TV or haven&#x27;t been to this site enough
to see most of them here is a bit of a spoiler free synopsis. The Green
Lantern Corps is a group of intergalactic police officers charged with
protecting the universe from all evil-doers. When a once overwhelming
force of evil called Parallax is accidentally released back into the
universe, no one is safe even the home of the Corps itself. Parallax
takes it&#x27;s revenge on the Lantern who imprisoned him and fatally wounds
him causing him before he dies to flee to the nearest system and find a
proper owner for his ring of power. The ring itself searches for a
proper wearer who is worthy of being a Green Lantern. It finds Hal
Jordan, cocky, fearless fighter jet pilot to be crowned new Lantern.<br /><br />It&#x27;s from here the movie goes on as it&#x27;s now his duty to take on
Parallax and grow into the Lantern he needs to be. Basically it&#x27;s a
origin comic book origin story. Every franchise has a movie like this
and you gotta learn about how the hero comes to be and the back story
of the powers etc. This is no different but it keeps you interested and
invested in the story from all aspects. From Hal Jordan the person, to
Hal Jordan as newest member of the Green Lantern Corps. The best
effects and eye candy is when Jordan is on Oa doing his training and
meeting other Lanterns. You simply are in awe looking at it all trying
to take in all the visual spectacle that is the heroic planet.<br /><br />All in all it&#x27;s a good movie. It never over steps it&#x27;s bounds to being
overly confusing, and doesn&#x27;t over stay it&#x27;s welcome. It&#x27;s got that
usual Ryan Reynolds charm to it as well. The little comedic quips and
funny looks that just make you chuckle just a little bit. Good enough
to make it funny but not enough to make it a farce of itself. The
supporting actors are all good in their roles but Mark Strong as the
strong GL Corps General, Sinestro is strong, and very confident. He
simply delivers an amazing performance that you will remember as much
as you will remember Reynold&#x27;s emerald warrior himself.<br /><br />Verdict--&#x3E; See this movie now, then see it again later. It was AWESOME.
You will get spine tingling goose-bumpy goodness every time you hear
the epic oath on screen. It was great in 3-d and I cannot wait to get a
chance to see it in IMAX when the local theater moves it over to the
one screen they have. Just a fun summer blockbuster and families, fan
boys, and casual fans will enjoy. It&#x27;s a comic book super hero movie so
don&#x27;t go into this looking for some convoluted epic drama affair. It
does what it does well and you will leave the movie with a smile.
Family/ kid wise ---&#x3E; There are a couple of curses, a middle finger and
depending on your kids age, Parallax might be a little scary but not
overly so. I think any school age kid whom can handle a few curses can
see it no problem.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Green Lantern 2 so we can get a ton of more action
and fighting and more glimpses of the Corps. It&#x27;s always more of an
actiony affair when you don&#x27;t have to deal with going full into an
origin story.<br /><br />Stay for the end credits as there is a small scene a couple of mins
into it but nothing after the credits.<br /><br />Again say it with me....<br /><br />In the brightest day, in the blackest night, no evil shall escape my
sight. Let those who worship evil&#x27;s might, beware my power GREEN
LANTERN&#x27;S LIGHT
