Wondering why the film is not just getting NEGATIVE reviews, but
actually getting TRASHED by critics? <br /><br />Here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133985/board/thread/184439327<br /><br />Answer: The script is just trash.<br /><br />That link above is the actual plot and script of the movie being
re-told using the Orange Power of Common Sense.<br /><br />This poor plotting of the script clearly shows you why the critics have
given this film all the negative reviews it deserves with all of the
contradictions, incoherent plots, and plot holes, this movie is filled
with.<br /><br />Just read the actual plot script yourself. There&#x27;s even the actual
Green Lantern wiki movie plot to follow along with. And if you still
don&#x27;t find that whole plot really silly, then Green Lantern may just be
that silly movie to give Warner Bros your $$$ money! <br /><br />Example: Actual Green Lantern plot re-told by the Power of Common
Sense!<br /><br />Scene 1 - Ferris Air Base (Control Center)<br /><br />Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad: &#x22;As head of Ferris Air, I want to sell my
super-awesome drones to the military. So I&#x27;m going have Hal Jordan and
my daughter Blake Lively, my own two test pilots, fight them and
presumably lose.&#x22;<br /><br />Military Guy: &#x22;Huh? Why would you do that? Why would we be okay with
that? You could have just told your pilots to lose on purpose so we buy
your drones. If you were even slightly intelligent, you would have
definitely done that instead.&#x22;<br /><br />Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad: &#x22;Don&#x27;t worry, gentlemen. Hal Jordan is such an
a--hole, he will be unable to resist trying to win. I promise.&#x22;<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Scene 2 - Ferris Air Base (Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad&#x27;s Office); after Hal and
Blake return from air drone training<br /><br />Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad: &#x22;Well, Hal, you used my daughter as a decoy and
then cheated to defeat the drones.&#x22;<br /><br />Blake Lively: &#x22;Specifically, you used me as a decoy, but didn&#x27;t
actually use that to your benefit, meaning you had me shot down for no
reason whatsoever.&#x22;<br /><br />Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad: &#x22;Now the military is going to refuse the contract,
and I&#x27;m going to have to fire countless employees. Good men are going
to lose their livelihoods because of you.&#x22;<br /><br />Blake Lively: &#x22;And although you&#x27;re supposedly such an awesome pilot,
you had a total freakout for no reason whatsoever and ended up
destroying your incredibly expensive plane, too.&#x22;<br /><br />Hal Jordan: &#x22;(shrugs) Oh well. Whatcha gonna do?&#x22;<br /><br />Blake Lively&#x27;s Dad: &#x22;Christ, what an a--hole.&#x22;<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Scene 3 - Coast; Abin Sur&#x27;s spacecraft crashed<br /><br />Abin Sur: Hal Jordan. The ring has chosen you because you are fearless.<br /><br />(1 minute earlier - inside an energy ball) Hal Jordan: I&#x27;m afraid of
being in this crazy green energy ball!<br /><br />(10 minutes earlier - during air training) Hal Jordan: I&#x27;m afraid of
dying in a test plane like my dad!<br /><br />(15 minutes after getting the ring - in a bar with Blake) Hal Jordan:
I&#x27;m afraid of intimacy!<br /><br />(25 minutes later - in Oa) Hal Jordan: I&#x27;m afraid of being a Green
Lantern!<br /><br />(30 minutes later - in Hal&#x27;s apartment) Hal Jordan: I&#x27;m afraid I suck
as a Green Lantern! <br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Read more scenes:
