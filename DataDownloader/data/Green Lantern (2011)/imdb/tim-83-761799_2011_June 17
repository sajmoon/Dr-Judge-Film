Don&#x27;t listen to the negative remarks. This is a great movie. I&#x27;ve been
a long time Green Lantern fan and the story line is a great adaptation
from the comics. Yeah there are little things about the acting and
writing, but they are overshadowed by the excellent story. This movie
is well worth your time and money. The origins and background are spot
on. I was glad the movie was built around the Green Lantern Corp. It is
important to know that there is more than one Green Lantern. They did a
really good job of showing Hal&#x27;s personality. My wife even liked this
movie. There is not dull moment. The momentum of the story keeps you
from being bored.
