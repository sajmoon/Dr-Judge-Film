This film was terrible. I could not believe they&#x27;ve picked Ryan
Reynolds to play Green Lantern, he belongs in rom-coms. And that is
what he almost turned this into, the comedy played far too big a part
in this. What little faith I had in Reynolds as playing this role was
shattered very quickly, he simply is not made for serious movies.
Though this film isn&#x27;t exactly serious, it isn&#x27;t exactly a comedy
either.<br /><br />Mainly though, the story line was completely flawed. The whole thing
just seemed like bits of &#x27;filler&#x27; taken from other films and clumped
together. Nothing was properly explained, like, why didn&#x27;t the evil guy
have a body? Why was he telekinetic if he didn&#x27;t have a stupid ring?
Why is fear yellow? Whenever they mentioned the yellow power of fear I
felt like I was watching kids play with action figures making up a
stupid story off the top of their heads. And the fact that all Green
Lantern needed to do was say the &#x27;vow&#x27; then become super powerful and
cunning to kill this thing? Being a superhero movie I was hoping for
more Earthly heroics. It was just ridiculous.<br /><br />The whole immortal thing was stupid as well. Seemed again like they
just couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea, so they just thought &#x27;ah whatever,
a load of unoriginal aliens sat in really high seats at the top of a
really high building who have infinite knowledge but then get proved
wrong. That sound okay?&#x27;. There was just not enough detail to any
aspect of this film. <br /><br />There was genuinely nothing I enjoyed about this film, being a teenager
lets me sort of enjoy a film if there&#x27;s good fighting or action in it,
even if I know the film is awful. Like 300. But this, simply offered me
nothing. Absolutely awful. Save your money.
