&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is an example of a movie whose importance does not lie
within the story, but lies within the action scenes. It has a very thin
plot, but has tons of action scenes, with a heavy arsenal of special
effects. This movie is a great example of movies who don&#x27;t care about
stories, plots, scripts, acting, but care about action, action, action!<br /><br />The plot is simple. Hal Jordan is chosen as the new Green Lantern, some
sort of cops who guard the universe. Dangerous creature Parallax
escapes from prison in space and is on the run to destroy the universe.
Hal Jordan and the Green Lanterns must stop Parallax. <br /><br />Let&#x27;s start with the special effects. Yes the special effects were
awesome, cool and great. The weapons that can be created by anyone who
wields the Green Lantern ring are quite awesome. But, it&#x27;s too much of
green. The design of Oa (planet of the Green Lanterns) is cool but
seems lacking of something. And the creatures in the film, it makes
&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; more like &#x22;Alice in Wonderland: Green Edition&#x22;. Despite
the green, the special effects were the upside of this movie. <br /><br />The fighting scenes were entertaining. Of course they were. If not,
this movie would have gotten a rotten 3. The action sequences were
awesome and definitely the reason why I watched this film. No need to
worry about the action scenes. No problem with it.<br /><br />Now, the downsides.<br /><br />The plot is thin and there is nothing special about it. It&#x27;s not
compelling and is uninteresting. It seems that the writers didn&#x27;t give
much time in composing the plot of this film. But first films in a
series have to be good, and a good movie needs a compelling story.
Maybe other first films might not have a good story, but they might
have great subplots. The subplots here are also simple: Hal has a
girlfriend in danger, an ugly professor related to Parallax becomes
Hal&#x27;s nemesis. So much for the plot.<br /><br />The acting. It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but wasn&#x27;t really convincing at the
same time. Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan wasn&#x27;t that bad, but wasn&#x27;t that
good too. The other fellow actors, not far behind. Possibly, the best
acting was Mark Strong&#x27;s portrayal of Sinestro. While it wasn&#x27;t the
same level of Oscar-standards, it was quite better than the others&#x27;
acting. But one man&#x27;s great acting doesn&#x27;t mean the acting of this film
is good. <br /><br />Now the 3D. 3D isn&#x27;t necessarily needed here. Although depth in the
picture can be noticed, mostly the film just feels like 2D, with the
exception of wearing 3D glasses as not wearing them would make the film
blurry. It looks as if the 3D was rushed, or basically the 2D version
of the film is blurred and can only made clear by using 3D glasses. So,
for 3D lovers, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the 3D so much here. <br /><br />As other films, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; also had some amusing things. The
strangest, and possibly most magical thing that happened in &#x22;Green
Lantern&#x22; is that how being a Green Lantern can transform Hal Jordan
from a jokeful, unserious person, into a solemn, and dedicated savior
of the universe. Plus, it&#x27;s only done within days, or at most, weeks.
That, I say, is an impossible thing to do. This makes me think of
naughty children all around the world. If we give these Green Lantern
rings to these naughty children, can their behavior transform in just a
matter of days. I&#x27;d love to see it. <br /><br />In terms of recommendation, I would recommend &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; to
moviegoers who love fighting scenes regardless of the plot or script.
The fighting scenes were really entertaining, but the plot? Nah. But
overall, I think &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is an average comic book adaptation
who targets on teenagers who love watching sequences of intense action.
3D, is not necessarily recommended, though. <br /><br />Despite the use of style over substance, I do hope for a sequel which I
hope improves from the first one in terms of plot, script, dialog, and
in portraying the color green. <br /><br />Prince AJB&#x27;s Rating: 6/10 (Average)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review on &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;. I do hope that this
review is useful for you.
