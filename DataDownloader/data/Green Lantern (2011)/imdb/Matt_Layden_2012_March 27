Hal Jordan is given a powerful ring from a dying alien. The ring gives
Hal the power to conjure anything his will desires. In receiving this
ring, Hal becomes a Green Lantern and must defend the universe against
all evil. In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my
sight. Let those who worship evil&#x27;s might, beware my power, Green
Lantern&#x27;s light!<br /><br />Exiting to see the Green Lantern get his big screen debut, sham it was
such a lackluster one that confused many people and didn&#x27;t do the
source material justice. The main problem with this film, isn&#x27;t the
shady CGI sequences, it isn&#x27;t the miscast Blake Lively and it isn&#x27;t
even the un-menacing villain. It&#x27;s the script, crippled with the pain
of telling an origin story that isn&#x27;t inspiring or interesting.<br /><br />The film opens with a narration of some events that is suppose to get
the viewer up to speed with things that will play a big part in the
story later on. The gist of it is that a Green Lantern had imprisoned
some evil, that evil escapes, kills that Green Lantern and his ring
finds a replacement. Enter our hero, with flaws, Hal Jordan, played by
the charming and witty Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds plays the character with
a bit of sass, but he&#x27;s still likable. Jordan has to overcome his fear
to be a great hero, we are shown some flashbacks of his father dying,
typical superhero daddy issue drama. The film had a chance to give us
something deeper, more meaningful and it chose not to. Not only that,
but what we get is weakly portrayed and thus we never truly feel the
weight of Jordan&#x27;s problems. <br /><br />Opposite Reynolds is one of two villains, Peter Sarsgaard, who plays
Hector Hammond. A brilliant scientist who becomes infected and descends
into madness. His story is told alongside Jordan&#x27;s. One is about the
rise to become a hero, the other is the demise of becoming a villain.
Interesting stuff there, but never really explored. Sarsgaard is
interesting as Hammond, but we never dive deep into this character.
Same goes for Reynold&#x27;s as Jordan. We never connect to any of the
characters on the screen, no matter how charismatic they may be. Which
brings me to Blake Lively, who was miscast. She is a pretty face for
sure, but not once is she believable as a pilot, or business woman.The
love interest is filler and it feels like it.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier the shady CGI. I&#x27;m not talking about his suit,
which has a lot of fans in an uproar. I actually like the skintight CGI
suit, it was visually pleasing compared to the basic costumed hero. I
had problems with the obvious mask he wore, which never truly felt like
he had one and a lot of the bad green screen when Jordan first arrives
on the planet Oa. Oa never truly felt magical like Asgard did in
Marvel&#x27;s Thor, but that&#x27;s not saying it was badly materialized. With
the power of the ring, which is one of the most powerful things in
Marvel&#x27;s universe. One would expect, well, anything the imagination can
come up with. The power of one&#x27;s will is immense and the creative minds
behind what we were shown, were lacking in the creativity department.
The training sequences were too short and the race car track to save
the helicopter was inane. <br /><br />When you introduce something like &#x22;whatever I can imagine, becomes
real&#x22; then you&#x27;re going to have many people say, &#x22;why not thing
bigger?&#x22; Despite this being an obvious crux, it&#x27;s one that I couldn&#x27;t
help but wonder myself. In the climax, why only have to jets pull you
away when you could have dozens? It&#x27;s not hard to add at least one more
jet to help save your life. Despite that, most of the special effects
worked. I liked the green imagery and the Parallax evil that invoked
9/11 imagery. To say the film was a total failure is wrong, it&#x27;s pretty
decent. As a superhero film it manages to do the core basics. It was
entertaining and held my attention. <br /><br />Despite obvious script problems and the big opportunity with Sinestero
wasted, Green Lantern is not as bad as people say. It&#x27;s just not as
good as you will hope for.
