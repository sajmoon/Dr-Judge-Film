one thing this film lacked was pace or an exciting story line.<br /><br />i was bitterly disappointed with the villain because the villain had
several similarities as the one rise of the silver surfer. the best
part about this film where the visual effects, which were good, but at
times didn&#x27;t make any sense at all.<br /><br />the film was further bought down by the lack of emotion coming from the
actors - much of the emotional stuff was very predictable and even
then, it was done horribly.<br /><br />i blame the direct, because i thought since martin Campbell (who
directed a James bond movie) was on the project, we would get a decent
film, but instead we got a just barely, good film.<br /><br />i was very disappointed - the casting of the actors and choice o
director didn&#x27;t work for me.
