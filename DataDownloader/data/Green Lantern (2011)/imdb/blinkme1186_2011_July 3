i have to say wow the critics tore this to shreds when it did not
deserve it, as far as i am concerned it was a very much enjoyable
origin movie, it is still leagues above some of the worse movies DC has
done like superman returns. the actors were chosen well and the script
and effects were acceptable. however i do have a theory as to why the
critics have been so harsh and to a degree it has to do with the other
summer blockbusters that came out Thor and x-men which were excellent,
but Marvel has established itself so well within the movies now they
can get that level of backing for anything...DC just has Nolan&#x27;s batman
franchise really. the problem lies also in the fact when promoting the
movie it was being compared to being the &#x22;next starwars&#x22; so to speak so
this lead to a massive skeptical effect and when it wasn&#x27;t starwars,
Thor or x-men the critics ripped it to shreds. it wasn&#x27;t a great movie
but it deserves better than it was given.
