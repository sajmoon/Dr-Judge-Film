The Guardians of the Universe have divided the Universe into 3,600
Space Sectors, each one protected by one powerful Green Lantern,
selected among fearless beings and with superpowers supplied by a ring
fed by the willpower from the planet Oa. When the evil force Parallax
that is fed by fear destroys several Green Lanterns, the member Abin
Sur (Temuera Morrison) flees in his spacecraft but crashes on Earth.
Deadly wounded, his green ring seeks out a successor for him and finds
the reckless but efficient test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). Hal
Jordan learns about the Green Lanterns and is bestowed with the powers
of the ring. Meanwhile the scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard)
is summoned to make an autopsy of Abin Sur and is possessed by
Parallax.<br /><br />Hal Jordan is insecure about his fears and uses his powers for the
first time in a party to save the life of people from a Ferris Aircraft
helicopter damaged by Hector and later he discloses his identity to his
former colleague Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), who is the beautiful
daughter of Carl Ferris (Jay O. Sanders) and his love. When Parallax
threatens Earth, the Green Lantern Hal Jordan is the last hope to
defend his planet from destruction. <br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; tells the story of how Hal Jordan becomes the Green
Lantern. I am not a follower of this hero and I had a slight idea about
his origin. The story is entertaining and Ryan Reynolds has a good
performance in the role of a hero. Peter Sarsgaard is a weak villain,
but the gorgeous Blake Lively has grown-up from &#x22;The Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants&#x22; and has a good performance in the role of Carol
Ferris. The cast has Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett in supporting roles
and the film is nor bad as mentioned in many reviews. My vote is six.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Lanterna Verde&#x22; (&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;)
