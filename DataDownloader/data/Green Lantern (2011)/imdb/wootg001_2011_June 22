to be quite honest i think this is a good film... seeing this in 3D was
probably the better option (don&#x27;t know what it would of been like as
2D) as the previous comments yeah i don&#x27;t think it is as good as x-men
but its still pretty amazing.. definitely was worth all the money i
paid.. <br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, everything i have seen he has portrayed
the character really well like in blade, he was the funny cocky guy. he
is generally a funny person. if you like action you will love this...
if you get the chance watch in 3D before it is released on DVD, because
DVD 3D&#x27;s aren&#x27;t as good.
