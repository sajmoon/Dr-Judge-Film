I&#x27;ve just seen both The Green Lantern and The Hangover II. I&#x27;d sit in a
theatre a dozen times to see The Green Lantern even though its story is
pretty well non-existent. The special effects were what the movie is
all about and they were well done. That The Green Lantern has a lower
rating than The Hangover II is mind-blowing. I could not, would not
force myself to sit through that movie. It was TERRIBLE. I appreciate
humour but this movie was an insult from the get-go. I wasn&#x27;t alone
leaving the theatre early and I haven&#x27;t talked to one person who
thought it was funny. In comparison to The Hangover it was a complete
bust. The Green Lantern may have lacked a memorable story line but at
least it was entertaining!
