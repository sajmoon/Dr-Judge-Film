All in all I thought this was a pretty good superhero movie. I have
always been a big Marvel fan and especially Spider-man, but their films
may usually be competent they always leave me feeling under-whelmed.
But where they fail every time DC has succeeded in this very comic-like
superhero offering. Yes Green Lantern was predictable and there were
somethings that grated (the constant banging on about the corp was a
bit to gung ho conjuring up more visions of brainless violence than
superhero good guys for me, but that is just nit-picking really. The
humour on the part of Reynolds was good and the not all bad bad guy was
also carried off quite well by Sarsgaard. Got to say I gave a little
silent cheer when sleazy senator Robbins got his fork-tongued
comeuppance - or was I supposed to be sorry he got the chop? The action
sequences where also executed well with none of the usual confused
mayhem of too much going on CGI a la Transformers, many of us got tired
of long ago. Saw the final little sequence coming way back in the film
though.
