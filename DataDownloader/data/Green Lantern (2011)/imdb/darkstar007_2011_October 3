I just finally watched the extended version of the movie. And it took
me this long to get to it because i like many other people heard it
sucked. That could be further from the truth. I kinda regret now not
watching it in the movie theater and supporting the film. Just goes to
show, should not listen to what everyone else has to say. Guess some
die hard comic book fans were not to happy about it. But i say it was
just good fun.<br /><br />One thing that threw me off from watching it originally was the on the
TV commercials it appeared like the CGI was just awful (Maybe the could
have left that part out of the trailers). But after watching the movie
i now see i was wrong. Being that i had never read any Green Lantern
comics i did not understand that the Green Lantern Outfit was more like
a skin and not a costume ala superman, batman, flash. So from the
trailers my misconception of the Green Lanterns look was that it was
just a bad case of a CGI outfit, which it isn&#x27;t. So just Watch it
yourself and make your own decision.
