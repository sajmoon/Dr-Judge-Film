A brazen man named Hal Jordan, who tests the limits of everything he
does, including flying fighter jets like he&#x27;s got nothing to lose, has
these impressive powers thrust upon himself and has to fill the shoes
of an esteemed alien warrior named Abin Sur that crashed on Earth and
is dying. If that wasn&#x27;t enough he&#x27;s given the responsibility to
protect the world with this little bitty ring from a monolithic entity
called Parallax that feeds off of fear--like a whispering voice that
nags inside your ear and tells you you can&#x27;t amount to anything before
succumbing to its hungry jaws.<br /><br />Mr. Jordan has a few things on his plate to work out in his personal
life, such as continually disappointing those around him, including his
family, co-workers and old love interest named Carol who also works
with him but grew up and he didn&#x27;t. Without having a chance to really
think about what he&#x27;s getting into by giving his word to the dying
alien and swearing an oath to this weird green orb, he takes what&#x27;s
happening in stride. His powers come out of the ring by accident but it
isn&#x27;t until he&#x27;s transported to this distant planet called Oa that
houses the Green Lantern Corps, does he really understand the scope and
magnitude. There are droves of others just like him that are assigned a
certain area in the galaxy to protect--except his position is unique
because Earth is a younger planet that has never had a ring bearing
guardian. He&#x27;s not taken very seriously and like something out of the
Marine Corps he has to go through make-or-break training to prove he&#x27;s
up to snuff.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a hermit named Hector Hammond is taken to a secret facility
to examine the body of the alien and in the process is infected by a
contagion left over from Parallax from his battle with Abin Sur prior
to crashing on Earth. Hal Jordan and Hector Hammond are figuring out
what their powers are capable of in interspliced shots. They both crave
their fathers&#x27; respect and also have an eye for Carol, except she only
sees potential love in Jordan. Now with Hammond&#x27;s powers coming into
fruition he decides to do something about it that doesn&#x27;t include just
asking her out because that&#x27;s not what psychos do.<br /><br />As a massive budget feature, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; samples the board without
being on top of its game with it all. It&#x27;s mostly easy entertainment
that plays it safe and somewhat formulaic at times, though it comes
with a few challenges regarding not measuring up to what you&#x27;re
supposed to be and having to conquer yourself before you can beat your
enemies. It constantly plays on a relatability factor with the &#x22;cool&#x22;
aspect of having unlimited power that&#x27;s conjured up from the lantern
ring by just using your will. Any object you can think of--such as a
machine gun, sword, giant fist--will come out of the ring in a green
mirage that packs a physical punch or safety net to save innocents;
think of Mr. Fantastic meets Bugs Bunny. Unlike the realism in &#x22;X-Men:
First Class,&#x22; this requires more of your imagination to reach out such
as traveling great distances so quickly, everybody speaking the same
tongue, being able to breath wherever they go, not one astronomer
spotting any activity on these distant planets prior. If you&#x27;re a comic
book reader, this won&#x27;t be a stretch as brushing over the details to
accelerate an epic story has been happening since super-heroes were
first inked in space.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds retains a lot of himself here from past movies by giving
out some of his typical one-liners but on the other hand adds a fun
element to what could have been serious subjects. Peter Sarsgaard is
almost unrecognizable as he keeps it downbeat and deplorable due to
sinking further and further into something &#x22;else.&#x22; Like &#x22;Iron Man&#x22; with
Jeff Bridges&#x27; character, this attempted to include another big star
face, though Tim Robbins plays it stiff and safe as his role didn&#x27;t
require range or any likability. The 3-D gave a chance to show off some
of the outer reaches of space with nearly pure CGI shots of planets
that jut out and are painted with various splashes of color. Some of it
is detailed, though the other parts look somewhat dated and almost what
you&#x27;d expect out of a video game instead. Not all of the movie required
3-D as a share of it was a building process to a concluding battle
where the results felt somewhat inevitable and predictable. That&#x27;s one
aspect a sequel could include more of: more action in between that
doesn&#x27;t have to be crammed at the end instead of distracting with token
love interests and unnecessary, quirky buddies on the side beforehand.
