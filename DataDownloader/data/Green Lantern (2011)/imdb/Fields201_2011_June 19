I went to see Green Lantern because a friend of mine was boycotting DC
for such a long time because there has been no release of a Green
Lantern movie. Sure, there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and
Superman, but where&#x27;s Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his
plea, and the result is this.....<br /><br />A mess.<br /><br />I will go on record to say that it&#x27;s at least enjoyable. Even though
the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters
being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that
during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at
least interested to see where the movie is going.<br /><br />Let me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green
Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a
hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The
Parallax. So when their alien friend who&#x27;s name I cannot remember falls
to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and
somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a
new ability, and that he is the earth&#x27;s only hope, but he can&#x27;t handle
that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy
turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and
Ryan has to stop him too.<br /><br />I must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not
accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he
turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing
Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could
otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were
coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed, and
not only did scenes felt random, but events turn random too.<br /><br />Like the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens
out of nowhere. One minute he&#x27;s talking to this kid (which never served
much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he&#x27;s walking and
gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This
happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the
place, even on Reynold&#x27;s outfit, and it&#x27;s rather distracting. It&#x27;s very
vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and
took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are
underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing
they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt
underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the
characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.<br /><br />However, Green Lantern isn&#x27;t boring, just purely average. I think the
reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not
expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this
film is awful before its release, so I ended up getting a little more
than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining, to say the
least.
