You know what? I like this movie. Fun, good action, comic book stuff
which I love, and sure, some decent acting to boot. The female lead is
hot, strong and she can act. The bad guys are kind of the problem in
this movie, too many weird connections trying to bring too many Green
Lantern enemies into one flick. <br /><br />I think this movie is a little irreverent in terms of comic book
movies, takes some jabs at itself and has fun in the process. I&#x27;ve
never seen Ryan Reynolds before, reminds me of Jason from True Blood,
but he did a very good job.<br /><br />I recommend it for what it is: light, fun and comic book entertainment.
