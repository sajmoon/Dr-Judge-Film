it was so much better than what I was expecting from it, the teasers
and the trailers didn&#x27;t do it much justice but it was a fun and a good
superhero movie, I really enjoyed it even though I went to watch it
with no high hopes, but I was mistaken.<br /><br />It was a good surprise and I really, really hope it has a sequel I
think the acting was good, the special effects were pretty darn good
and I liked the story as well, they managed to explain the basic stuff
in 2 hours. It would&#x27;ve been better if it was a bit longer but I don&#x27;t
understand why people don&#x27;t like it as much, I think it was better than
Thor, as far as story and special effects.<br /><br />I hope it gets more positive reviews &#x27;cause it was a great movie which
served its purpose...ENTERTAIN!
