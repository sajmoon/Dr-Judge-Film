While I admit this movie had it&#x27;s flaws, I do strongly believe this
movie has been vastly underrated by the public. Unfortunately Green
Lantern came at a time when comic inspired novels have been done almost
to death. While most done quite brilliantly (most being the operative
word here) Green Lantern I believe did not live up to the expectations
we now have of comic adaptations.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was a great choice for the role of The
Green Lantern, the character arc while helping you to understand the
character of Hal Jordan was sufficient I do believe they could of well
exceeded what they did.<br /><br />For a story as immense as the Green Lantern I believe that the close to
two hours was to short to completely describe and help understand the
Green Lantern universe. The length I believe to be the biggest drawback
in this movie. In my opinion the movie should of been closer to the
length of The Watchmen to completely illustrate the complexity and
brilliance that the Green Lantern universe really is.<br /><br />For me, I believed the hype going into this movie, I had a completely
closed mind and fully expected this movie to be as one critic described
it &#x22;Green Lantern, The worst comic book movie ever made&#x22;. Honestly I
have to say that I&#x27;m glad that I read that review before viewing this
movie as it made it all that sweeter when the movie went beyond all I
thought it would be and greatly impressed me.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sorry that this movie was received so badly because the chances of
seeing a sequel have dropped and in a universe where anything is
possible I think we will miss out on all that the Green Lantern
franchise could be.
