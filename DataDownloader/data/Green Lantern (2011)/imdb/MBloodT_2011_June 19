We are getting decent and compelling superhero movies these days, which
is a great thing that happened to the genre. Now &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is one
of those films that also needs to be powerful, but it ends up being a
generic cheesy cinema. &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is not perfectly horrible or the
worst superhero movie ever but it&#x27;s just too much exposition and a
whole lot of green cheese.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; has a great concept. Just like the other superhero
films, the storytelling also needs to be compelling. Unfortunately, the
film gets lazy to tell the story so they just threw a lot of narration
and even the ones that are not quite necessary to narrate. The action
is not very amazing. it&#x27;s just showing us how eye-candy the effects
are.<br /><br />At least the movie is loyal to its corniness. Hal Jordan&#x27;s wacky
imagination and the aliens&#x27; zany looking faces. The CGI is pretty. The
performances were entertaining enough. Ryan Reynolds is doing his same
old thing. Mark Strong didn&#x27;t appear so much (which is disappointing)
but still he&#x27;s awesome.<br /><br />It&#x27;s disappointing because they&#x27;re making the interesting villains into
uninteresting. Example, Parallax should be terrifying and menacing.
Instead he&#x27;s a scrambled egg who eats fear. Not really terrifying nor
menacing. Peter Sarsgaard&#x27;s mad scientist performance was pretty good
but the only thing he did in this film is crying in agony and use his
telekinesis powers in a lame way.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; just wanted to show its beautiful visuals. It&#x27;s not a
very bad thing but the filmmakers doesn&#x27;t take its storytelling so
seriously. It can be entertaining for some reason but it can also be
forgettable. It&#x27;s good to see it in the big screen for the visuals but
you don&#x27;t want to see it again after that. This might be the weakest
superhero movie of the year. Even &#x22;The Green Hornet&#x22; is better than
this. &#x22;Thor&#x22; might be the best superhero film of 2011 so far in my
opinion because even though the action isn&#x27;t great, at least there is a
compelling storytelling. The sad thing is, both the action and the
storytelling are not compelling in &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;.<br /><br />3D? Very dark!
