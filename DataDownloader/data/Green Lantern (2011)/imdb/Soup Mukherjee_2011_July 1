For a comic book movie, Green Lantern had the potential to be great. If
the writers of the movie even watched the animated movie First Flight,
they would&#x27;ve been able to come up with a better script than what they
did. I think the cast did the best that they could with the corny lines
and terrible writing.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds was believable as Hal Jordan, Blake Lively was
exceptional in her role (which primarily involved looking pretty which
she is good at) and Mark Strong as Sinestro was flawless. Though I
thoroughly disliked what the writers did to this movie, I do hope the
GL series isn&#x27;t written off. There is still enough in the story of
Green Lantern for a sequel, but for the love of Oa the old script
writers need to go and a brand new team needs to bring something to the
table. Mark Strong is an acting powerhouse and as we have seen in the
Dark Knight, it is the villain and not the hero that makes an
exceptional comic book movie! Sinestro has to do for GL what the Joker
did for Batman! Thats my 2 cents
