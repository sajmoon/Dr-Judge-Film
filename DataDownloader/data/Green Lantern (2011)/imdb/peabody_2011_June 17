The sense of disappointment most DC fanboys felt with Catwoman or
Superman Returns or Jonah Hex or Steel or ... well, you get the point.
That profound non-Nolan DC disappointment will deepen with Green
Lantern, which now lands in theatres with a resounding thud. This
rather silly premise of a movie is simply terrible on most levels and
average in others. Minor attempts at bad tongue-in-cheek humor mixed
with crazy alien CG and worst of all, the limited action was heartless
action. It delivers nothing but a bloated and self-important waste of
film even though the running time is short. That&#x27;s a tough thing to
pull off even if they were trying to do it. Talk about caught in no
man&#x27;s land. It doesn&#x27;t give you wild popcorn action and it doesn&#x27;t come
close to delivering deep character or plot. It does remind me of the
swing and a miss that was Fantastic Four simply because nothing really
happened worth watching. Hopefully, this slide into ponderous absurdity
means DC will hire Nolan for life and make him director of non-Batman
material. Someone needs to stop this madness.<br /><br />This asinine collection of computer graphics and insane dialogue is
just a disgrace to the fresh and revolutionary source material. To
non-comic book readers, comic books themselves really aren&#x27;t this dumb
and cheesy. Don&#x27;t judge the source material based on crap films like
this one.
