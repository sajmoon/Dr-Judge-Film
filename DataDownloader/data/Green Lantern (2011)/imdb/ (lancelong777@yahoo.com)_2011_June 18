Where do I start? Okay, lets start with the acting since most people
think the actor makes the movie instead of the movie making the actor.
Blake Lively, please, make me understand how this person is even
allowed in film. She can not act and she certainly is not enough eye
candy (samantha fox) to warrant making me suffer through two hours of
her bad acting and misshaped facial ticks. I love Ryan Reynolds in
everything but feel that he over &#x22;cheesified&#x22; the character. The movie
itself wasn&#x27;t a total waste but is reminiscent of the first Hulk. Great
actor playing the Hulk but the movie was inferior. Same thing with
Green Lantern, the CGI wasn&#x27;t exactly on par with what we are used to
seeing in the theaters and therefore, I do not recommend that you go
spend twenty something for your time and money not so well spent.
