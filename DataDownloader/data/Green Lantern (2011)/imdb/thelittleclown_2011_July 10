I was going to stay away from this movie after hearing bad reviews, but
having a chance to go to the theater and being a comic fan, I gave it a
shot. I can honestly say that I actually liked it. It didn&#x27;t surpass
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s work on Batman, but did it need to? I&#x27;ll admit that
it&#x27;s not a perfect film, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it&#x27;s being made
out to be. The title character is handled solidly and the supporting
characters are good too. It was a creative and entertaining adaptation
of the Green Lantern universe and it surpassed my expectations. So if
you happen to be looking for a movie with some good action and decent
characters with some humor thrown in here and there, this movie isn&#x27;t a
bad choice. Seriously, it&#x27;s far better than many would have you
believe.
