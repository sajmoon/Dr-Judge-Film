STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A warrior from a different galaxy crash lands on earth and passes his
special powers on to test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) who
transforms into the super hero The Green Lantern. With a noble,
courageous spirit kept alive by the memory of his father, who died as a
test pilot before him, Jordan is a suitable candidate for this role.
But he faces a threat from inter-galactic warrior Sinestro (Mark
Strong) who has a fiendish plot to attack the earth, and must protect
his love interest and co pilot Carol (Blake Lively.) <br /><br />I appreciate my plot summary to the film adaptation of The Green
Lantern probably isn&#x27;t one of my best, but I&#x27;m describing it in as lazy
and uninvolving a way as I found the story, which failed to hold my
interest at all. The latest in a chain of old comic book franchises
resurrected for a modern day re boot (though whether it&#x27;s from the DC
or Marvel chain I honestly don&#x27;t know) in recession era Hollywood, the
film is a prime example of everything that makes these modern day
updates go so wrong and feel so processed and uninspired as they do.<br /><br />Comic book films, as a rule (Batman aside) shouldn&#x27;t take themselves
too seriously and should be as joyful and fun a ride as possible, but
Martin Campbell isn&#x27;t a director who&#x27;s up to this task. I&#x27;ve loved most
of his films in the past, but his undeniably dull, humourless streak as
a director is at odds with a film where the costumes the characters
wear provide a naturally colourful, snazzy back drop to everything else
going on. <br /><br />The film is just completely at odds with itself with everything from
the tone to the story, and only the cast really help it up a notch.
Reynolds fits the role as the hero being the right sort of age and
appearance, even if his acting ability isn&#x27;t up to much, while Lively
is pretty as the love interest. Most notable of all is unsurprisingly
Strong, who&#x27;s making these dark, dastardly villain roles his stock in
trade (hopefully not Hollywood falling into the old trap of type
casting English actors in villainous roles) but even he fails to
generate any more interest in such a weak script and story, ditto quite
a lively supporting cast including Tim Robbins, Peter Sarsgaard and
Angela Bassett.<br /><br />For all it&#x27;s faults as a film, though, you just know it will seem
legendary compared to the sequel you know is probably already in the
pipe line. **
