The danger here was always going to be the decision whether to throw
all the eggs in the basket and hit us with the best green lantern has
to offer in terms of powers and his ultimate nemesis or to play it
slowly and open up a potential franchise.<br /><br />The writer(s) here obviously wanted to make an attempt at the latter
and i thought it was a commendable effort even if it did sometimes feel
like it was labouring in places and rushing in others.<br /><br />Its hard to put a finger on exactly what they did wrong, they certainly
got more right than other films in this genre recently and have brought
another superhero to the big screen which should be and sort of is a
good thing.<br /><br />First off i like Ryan Reynolds as an actor, he has a good ability for
comedic turns and yet also able to bring emotion to his roles. In this
role he was promoted in the build up to its release as playing the
character more straight and less his usual sarcastic persona we have
seen before. And yet still it felt like he hadn&#x27;t fully shed it, like
any moment he was going to slap in a deadpan remark.<br /><br />The film is VERY CGI heavy, and this deliberate call does influence how
you will take this film on board. To me it was not only a necessity to
bring us the green lantern as he should be but it also made the scenes
where he wasn&#x27;t on this planet run a lot smoother. But I&#x27;m also aware
that people out there hate CGI effects so if you are one of them this
really isn&#x27;t for you.<br /><br />The storyline played out well, it managed to bring us a back story of
sorts to why Hal Jordan is the way he is, and even fleshed him out a
little bit with a scene showing some family time for him, but its in
and around here that elements seem to niggle away at me as the pacing
cant make up its mind. At times a moment lingers almost too long,
before we are then yo-yoing between plot points until they have felt
like they have given us a full enough picture to it all. When the green
lantern side of it comes into play they manage to calm the film down a
little while cranking up the action. They find good time to show
training and learning about it all before putting into play the
villains and forcing the finale upon our hero, with plenty of
opportunities to show personal growth in more than one of the
characters.<br /><br />What i will say to conclude is go into this with an open mind to enjoy
a superhero film, ignore any preconceptions you might have had about
the trailer because it seems a lot of us felt that trailer was mediocre
at best. What i found after the film was that it had felt very much
like a good foundation film to a trilogy or at least a 2 parter,
putting in place the origins and some subtle plot lines that seem to be
loose ends now but will obviously come into play in a major fashion
should a sequel or two be commissioned.<br /><br />So go into this expecting to see the first film in a franchise, enjoy
what they start and then expect to either feel hungry for more and on a
grander scale... or realise this isn&#x27;t the franchise for you and move
on happy in the knowledge the film didn&#x27;t drag on forever nor did it
try to explain things to death.
