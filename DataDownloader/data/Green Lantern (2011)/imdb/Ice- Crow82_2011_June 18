I thought I had absolutely no interest in this superhero, and maybe my
low expectations are why I was in no way disappointed with this movie.
But either way, I think that &#x22;Green lantern&#x22; is an enjoyable action
movie, with some decent laughs in there too.<br /><br />Film sees the usually annoying Ryan Reynolds (Whose actually been
growing on me since &#x22;buried&#x22;) get a ring from outer space which gives
him super powers. The powers that this character has (he&#x27;s a superhero
I&#x27;m unfamiliar with it has too be said) are actually what made the
movie work for me. This superhero is different and interesting with the
unique things he can pull off while in his cheesy green costume, and
the fact the film is in no way taking itself too seriously (unlike more
popular superheros like Batman) works even further in its favour.<br /><br />Flick seems too be getting a hard time from critics for whatever
reason. Perhaps its not brought too the screen well in the eyes off
those who knew this character beforehand. But I didn&#x27;t know this guy
beforehand and found myself liking it so can&#x27;t complain. The only
things I will say against it are that some great actors are in here
being sorely wasted in lame parts while Reynolds (even though he does a
good job) seems overused in superhero movies, being in a &#x22;Blade&#x22; movie,
an &#x22;x-men&#x22; movie, and now this. Peter Sarsgaard looked promising as the
villain but then ended up eventually looking as silly as Mark Strong
does with his red face and &#x22;spock&#x22; ears. Compared too &#x22;The Dark
knights&#x22; Joker, and &#x22;x-mens&#x22; Magneto, these rogues aren&#x27;t as
interesting as this superhero deserves. But again, they&#x27;re probably
part off &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; history. Which i&#x27;m clueless about remember.
