OK... I&#x27;m not sure what movie the critics saw but it wasn&#x27;t this one...
Just got back from seeing it and was impressed. They hit all the notes
for the Green Lantern fans and had enough story to give the non fans
some fun too. Ryan Reynolds was good as Hal Jordan and captured his
cocky self centered devil may care attitude very well. He did a great
job balancing the bewilderment of the situation with his ultimate
responsibility. Mark strong really stole the show as Sinestro. He
captured his arrogance and superiority perfectly. Loved seeing the
members of the Green Lantern corp brought to glorious life on the big
screen and loved the CGI. I especially got a kick out of the constructs
Hal comes up with (yes cheesiness as well) It was a refreshing change
of pace from all the dark, take itself way to serious tone of some of
the more recent superhero films ( Dark Knight anyone) I can see where
the critics would destroy it, but movies like this aren&#x27;t meant to
Academy Award films...they&#x27;re meant to be fun. And Green Lantern was
exactly that.<br /><br />By the way stay for the credits... As with so many films now a days
there&#x27;s a nice little set up for the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />My advice...see it and just have some fun
