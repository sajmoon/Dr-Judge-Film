DC Comics The Green Lantern &#x22;Darkest night, darkest hour...&#x22; was always
going to be a tough sell to non comic book audiences. The hero derives
his power from a ring and he needs to charge it from his nifty green
lantern, really? Hal Jordon (Ryan Reynolds) is the ultra cocky,
handsome and improbable fighter jock, dog fighting sophisticated drone
jet fighters as part of an advanced weapons program. Haunted by his
test pilot fathers death, Jordan battles his own demons as to whether
he feels fear, embraces it or continues to run through a series of
empty but very beautiful liaisons.<br /><br />Meanwhile in a galaxy far far away, on the planet &#x22;Oa&#x22; a corp of &#x22;Green
Lantern&#x27;s&#x22; stand guard over the Universe, dividing it into sectors
which they are entrusted to defend. Under the overall control of the
guardians, think Yoda on very high poles, the Green Lantern corp stand
watch. Protecting their charges from evil using the &#x22;will&#x22; of the
people as a source for their power, defined by a very bright Green
light. Evil in the form of Parallax, who was cast away into oblivion
after dabbling in the even more powerful &#x22;fear&#x22; power source, is now
awakened and is firmly in the yellow corner.<br /><br />The unfortunate Hal is chosen by the ring following the crash landing
of Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) after he is injured in a battle with
Parallax. The ring never fails and always chooses correctly, which is
seriously questioned when part of the underlying creed for the corps is
responsibility, a character trait Hal does not readily demonstrate.<br /><br />Aided by his friend Tom (Waititi) Hal shows off his new power, a nifty
green suit and powers that appear only restrained by his own
imagination, including flying and morphing any objects he wishes to
realise. Beating up the local roughnecks at the local bar shows what he
is capable of and then flys to &#x22;Oa&#x22; to receive more formal training at
the hands of the local drill instructor, &#x22;Tomar Re&#x22; (Geoffrey Rush) a
colossal green giant apparently made of rocks.<br /><br />Sparking the interest of Green Lantern corps leader Sinestro (Mark
Strong), he disappoints the group and returns to earth in a funk.<br /><br />Meanwhile, senator Robert Hammond (Tim Robbins) and his son Peter
(Peter Saarsgard) are doing some dabbling themselves into the power
provided by fear following the postmortem of &#x22;Sur&#x22;. Modern movies
always have politicians as bad guys, there clearly is a message there
somewhere.<br /><br />Hal is called upon to defend the earth from the ever more powerful
Parallax, drawn to the power that the Hammond&#x27;s have unearthed. Whether
Hal triumphs over evil and peace is restored is not the point, this is
a comic book adaptation after all but is it fun? Following the critical
mauling the film received, the end result is not so bad. Director
Campbell has kept the whole enterprise moving along at speed, is it
silly and preposterous, of course. There are moments to enjoy, the
reveal to the beautiful Ferris (Lively) is unexpected and welcome. The
decision to provide the suit via CGI does detract from the reality,
which in a film of this type is desperately needed due to the fanciful
nature of the story.<br /><br />There are too many effects and on occasion the story is in danger of
imploding into it&#x27;s own pretentiousness but it all just about skates by
on the charm of the lead and his ability to mock himself. &#x22;By the power
of Grey Skull&#x22; or &#x22;To Infinity and Beyond&#x22; are two of the oath&#x27;s
attempted to get the ring to work.<br /><br />The film is light and breezy, making no claims for a darker vision or
Batman inner turmoil and torment. This harks back more to the original
Superman&#x27;s where comic book characters were just that, unreal. The
effects are good but there are too many of them, the supporting
characters are adequate, there is no real identifiable villain to shout
at but the leads acquit themselves well enough in what must have been
an orgy of green screen work.<br /><br />A decision was clearly made that this would be gossamer light,
candyfloss fare for a family audience and on that level it just about
hits the mark. If you are looking for deeper meanings or complex
characters, there are better ways to spend your movie dollars.<br /><br />Summary <br /><br />Not as bad as feared, certainly not in the same league as other comic
book adventures but perhaps not the train wreck some have suggested.<br /><br />Mild, competent, implausible comic book fun with too much CGI and
little requirement for a sequel, therefore expect number 2 to arrive at
your local multiplex soon.<br /><br />http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/
