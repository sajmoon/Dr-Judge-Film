Looks cool. Sounds cool. The script is BEYOND weak. Moments seem
forced. Reynolds is a perfect Hal Jordan however. I blame the
director/producers for the mess they made here. What purpose did
Brainiac serve? NONE. A wasted villain. Jordan&#x27;s training in Oa was
shorter than the stack of stars people gave the movie. The movie is
redeemed at the very end in the final boss battle. In that scene, I was
finally roused by the character, the stakes were established, the
action was terrific. I don&#x27;t want to spoil it, but believe me, the last
5 minutes are the best moments in the film, IMO. <br /><br />For #2, if that happens, the direction and script have got to be
sharper than this was. With a legion of nerds at the internet&#x27;s
fingertips, there is no excuse for half-assed money grabs.
