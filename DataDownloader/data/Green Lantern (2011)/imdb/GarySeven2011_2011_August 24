This Movie is like walking into a pharmacy then suddenly getting
smashed in the belly with a FLAMING boot made of day old meat. While
your girl friend makes out with a little person who stole your wallet
and is flipping you the bird.<br /><br />This movie is one of the truest embodiment&#x27;s of all hat and no cattle.
What this film promises it just can&#x27;t deliver. Ryan Reynolds is at best
a tragic miscast in this role.<br /><br />It&#x27;s clear to see why this film failed while trying to be a summer
blockbuster it also tired to be a romantic comedy, an edge of your seat
action packed thriller and a COMIC BOOK FILM. Failing at all of them of
course, lest we forget source material? but they did.<br /><br />Excuse me I have to go I&#x27;m being fitted for a new CGI suit.
