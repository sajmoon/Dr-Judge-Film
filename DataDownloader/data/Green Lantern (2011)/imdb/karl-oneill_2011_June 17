A decent comic book adaptation of the DC comic book character Green
Lantern. <br /><br />It&#x27;s certainly not as bad as some critics have made it out to be. <br /><br />It&#x27;s fun, the action sequences are flashy and exciting. The acting is
all top notch and the humor is done really well. <br /><br />Green Lantern is unpretentious, probably even one of the most
unpretentious superhero movies ever made. It embraces its inherent
goofiness and excludes much of the angst and over-seriousness that we
seen in other comic book movies like Batman and Spiderman. <br /><br />The after-credits scene is awesome. A real fan pleaser and hopefully
they will make a sequel.
