Finally a Superhero film that everyone can enjoy!<br /><br />Very simply, SFX are top notch. In particular the location of space,
other worlds and technology of the suit. Nothing too dark or risqu&#xE9; in
the story or love interest (I can actually watch this with my kids),
this can&#x27;t be done with &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; or &#x22;The Hulk&#x22; too scary for
the little ones!<br /><br />I felt that Ryan Reynolds was perfect for Hal Jordan if not a touch
restrained. Not knowing the history of the characters or story, Green
Lantern seemed strait forward and easy to follow (until the final act). <br /><br />Hopefully there is a sequel, as they have built in some openness to the
finale that keeps non comic book fans guessing. I suppose the hard-core
fans will be wondering how true they will stay to Green lantern lore
and therefore hang in there for another ride!<br /><br />This reminded me of the classic animated cartoons from Saturday
mornings of old. Innocent and action packed.<br /><br />The bottom line. Enjoyable ride from start to finish.
