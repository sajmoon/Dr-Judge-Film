Ryan Reynolds stars as Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot hiding fear due
to memories of his father dying in an explosion, and who has a rocky
relationship with Carol Ferris (Blake Lively&#x27;s best imitation of
MacInTalk). One night, Hal is unexpectedly chosen by a green ring
belonging to a being known as Abin Sur, and upon accepting the ring, is
placed in the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps, an army of 3,600
intergalactic beings residing on the planet Oa, and led by the
suspicious Sinestro (Mark Strong, fire your agent). Meanwhile,
scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard in silly prosthetic makeup)
is analyzing the dead remains of Abin Sur, and is infected by the
particles of an entity named Parallax. This gives Hammond psychic
powers, while Parralax is seeking revenge against the Green Lantern
Corps, and Hal must master his fear to stop the entity from destroying
Earth. Sound convoluted yet? <br /><br />First off, we&#x27;re gonna get into the category of what I liked: First was
Peter Sarsgaard (minus the forehead) as the only sympathetic human in
the film, supplying it with proper gravity and believability. Second
was Tomar-Re, impressively voiced by Geoffrey Rush. Third was the
film&#x27;s brisk running time, but this is also a weakness. Now we get into
the second category: What I didn&#x27;t like.<br /><br />The film isn&#x27;t as disastrous as I&#x27;d predicted a year ago, when first
looks at the movie had started to surface, and it&#x27;s enjoyable at times,
but it&#x27;s just so irritating how monotonous the movie is. The tone feels
half asleep, the screenplay is overly jumbled and overstuffed, and
almost all of the actors, especially Reynolds and Lively, use one
expression for the whole movie, and act in unrealistic manners.<br /><br />Yes, even the technical aspects are on the disappointing side. For
instance, the film&#x27;s production designer is Grant Major, the same man
behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now, those movies were excellent
examples in set design, but I feel he was trying too hard here. The
aforementioned makeup by Joel Harlow is passable at best, the effects
by Sony Pictures Imageworks are very underwhelming, and even film
composing legend James Newton Howard manages to sound ill cohesive and
boring. Still, no matter how over produced everything was, one can&#x27;t
help but appreciate the crafts people who tried to give the film some
much needed spark.<br /><br />Regardless, it would probably be best to skip Green Lantern, and save
YOUR green for something better.<br /><br />I give it ** out of ****
