My kids (17, 19) and I were happily surprised that this was a much
better movie than we had been led to believe. The acting decent to very
good from all. The special effects great (especially in 3D), and the
story line was able to be followed by those who had no idea who/what GL
was/is. And that&#x27;s the way the movie should be made. Not everyone is a
GL fan with a working knowledge of GL lore and facts. They need to fill
in the story to inform people of the GL history while keeping the
action up and storyline moving. In our opinion they were able to do
this. We all agreed that if GL2 comes out we hope the cast will remain
the same. And we will not only go see it, but bring friends. Not the
best of reviews if you&#x27;re looking for what happened in the movie, but I
couldn&#x27;t let all those negative reviews go unchallenged.
