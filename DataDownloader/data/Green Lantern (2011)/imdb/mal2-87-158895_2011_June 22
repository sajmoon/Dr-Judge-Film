Awesome!!! The graphics were so outstanding. The acting was great and
Ryan Reynolds made the perfect Green Lantern. I hope he will be in the
sequel. For a change advertising for the movie did not over hype and
ruin it for the viewing public. It&#x27;s a great movie for all ages, I was
with my husband, My Son &#x26; Grandson ( who is legally blind and enjoyed
it as much as we did) and my brother. Be sure to watch in 3D, it&#x27;s
worth it. Do not pay attention to the critics or you will miss a great
show. We are all looking forward to a sequel real soon. Green Lantern&#x27;s
love interest in the film is very tastefully done. The flying scenes
were not overdone and Ryan Reynolds innocence and sex appeal makes the
movie exciting and funny. For a change they are not trying to scare the
life out of children but instead add very interesting graphics and fun
without blood, sex and swear words. A very refreshing change from the
last couple of Batman Movies.
