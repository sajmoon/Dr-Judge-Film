When I decide to go see a movie at a theater, I watch the trailers,
read some reviews and so on. For this movie, I ignored the scores, the
reviews and even the trailer, hoping everyone was too harsh on the
movie. But, in the end, I draw the same conclusion: it&#x27;s disappointing
at all levels.<br /><br />The acting is good, Ryan Reynolds fits into his character well, the
other characters do a good job to sustain the action but the plot is
awful. It&#x27;s inconsistent, jumping from a scene to another without any
linkage, some things that happen must be deduced by the audience. So
many things happen at the same time and many of them are unimportant.<br /><br />They spent a lot of money on the special effects, yet I wasn&#x27;t so
impressed by what they did. It lacks imagination and vision for a
superhero movie. Other movies with less special effects are a lot
better due to the storyline (take for example Captain America: The
First Avenger or XMen First Class).<br /><br />All in all, I rate the movie with a 5 because of the cast and good act
and for being the first Green Lantern movie. I really hope they will
learn from this failure and make the next, not better, but good enough
so we can be satisfied and forget about the first.
