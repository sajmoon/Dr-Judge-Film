So all I read all week was about how bad this movie was. I am aware
that when I go to see a movie with high expectations, I am often let
down. So when I saw Green Lantern I expected the worst. So right out of
the box the acting was stiff and roboticlly scripted. I was very
worried. But after awhile I found myself at home in the story. If
anything the first act could be better (reshot). The effects were
oh-humb but at least not over-the-top like Super 8. Ryan Renynolds is
always entertaining. I do think he could of been giving more
opportunity to ad-lib. that is where he&#x27;s at his best, but he still
shines by the end. And Blake Lively is worth the $11.50 every time.<br /><br />So it&#x27;s not the best movie of all time... nor the worst. It is mindless
superhero fun... and most of the time that is enough.
