The writing for this film is simply a stringing together of old clich&#xE9;s
and sophomoric humor. Sometimes a successful film can still hit
theaters despite this provide the character development and acting is
exceptional. Sadly the opposite is true with this film. All
performances are flat except for the role of Hector Hammond played by
Peter Sarsgaard. He brings life briefly to an otherwise DOA movie. The
special effects are occasionally amazing, but this is hardly a glowing
recommendation. I&#x27;d say have this film playing in the background
without sound. Create your own soundtrack from your personal MP3
collection.
