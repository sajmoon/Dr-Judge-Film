And so it continues. With Marvel Studios dominating the comic/film
crossover market, DC has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to
expand past it&#x27;s Christopher Nolan Batman series (especially since the
third film is said to be the final). With Zack Snyder&#x27;s Superman reboot
two years away, Warner had to rely on GREEN LANTERN to get people
excited for DC properties. I guess someone dropped the ball on this
one. Instead of an exciting sci-fi/superhero adventure that could span
the galaxy with one of the most interesting characters in the DC
universe, we&#x27;re treated to the most generic superhero films I&#x27;ve ever
sat through. This movie is, in fact, lamer than the Tim Story FANTASTIC
4 films. DC&#x27;s Green Lantern series is extensive with a long and varied
history, and the film focuses on one of the more popular Lanterns: Hal
Jordan, of DC&#x27;s Silver Age. The Green Lantern Corps is an intergalactic
peacekeeping collective with members from all reaches of the Universe.
Hal Jordan becomes the first human to join the Corps when his
predecessor, Abin Sur, crash-lands on Earth following an encounter with
Parallax, a powerful ever-growing entity that feeds and thrives on
fear. Jordan receives the green power ring and eventually arrives at
the planet Oa, the home of the Lantern Corps, where he receives a brief
training before questioning his role in the Corps and whether he has
the fearless disposition to accept his position. As Parallax grows
stronger and threatens the Corps, a bit of his energy finds its way
into xenobiologist Hector Hammond and infuses him with exceptional
powers that only build upon his own festering hate and turn him into an
additional threat.<br /><br />As with any superhero origin story, there is a lot going on in GREEN
LANTERN and the problem is that the movie just breezes through it all
to try and cram it into its two-hour runtime. Here&#x27;s an idea: with a
history as rich as that of the Green Lantern series, maybe take your
time to ease the audience into it all. A good piece of the audience
going into the movie has no real idea about the world of Green Lantern,
and they are going to need introduced in a manner than can understand.
Being a casual fan, I knew enough to get started. The movie blasts
through the important points as if reading off a checklist and assuming
that they&#x27;re giving enough for people new to the franchise to follow
along: &#x22;All right, here we go. You&#x27;re a Green Lantern now. Here&#x27;s your
power ring. It can manifest anything you can imagine, just keep it
charged. This is Oa, homeworld to the Corps and the Guardians of the
Universe. They run this whole operation. OK, you can fly now and your
first job is tackling this evil, exceptionally powerful being who&#x27;s
killed many experienced Lanterns already and destroyed two worlds. You
got all that? Good. Take care of business and we&#x27;ll see you at brunch.&#x22;
Jordan&#x27;s training and introduction to the Corps is breezed through so
fast, it&#x27;s a wonder if new audience members had any real idea what was
going on. Instead, it&#x27;s just a footnote in a movie that&#x27;s so dedicated
to following the established superhero origin beats that it never
breaks out to become anything fun. We meet Hal Jordan, he gets the
ring, he receives his &#x22;training&#x22;, he questions his role, he saves some
lives, he gets in his first real battle with the villain and loses, he
questions himself again, and then he&#x27;s tossed into the final battle.
It&#x27;s like superhero connect-the-dots.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t have been so disappointed in GREEN LANTERN&#x27;s laziness if it
had been more entertaining. But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s mostly just stupid. It&#x27;s
gaping plot issues have been covered in so many web articles that it&#x27;s
almost not worth mentioning here, but come on&#x85;.how does Parallax (a
creature of immense power that nearly destroyed the Corps before)
escape so freakin&#x27; easily? He&#x27;s not even guarded! And the aliens that
stumbled across him don&#x27;t seem aware of the fact that they&#x27;re toying
around on a planet used as a prison for one of the strongest evil
beings in the universe. Its just&#x85;whoops, well he&#x27;s out now. Why did Hal
use Carol as a decoy during their flight test when it accomplished
absolutely nothing other than set him up as an arrogant jerk? Why was
young Hal Jordan allowed to run across the tarmac unattended moments
after his father just crashed in a flaming inferno in the flashback?
Was there no one there who thought, &#x22;Wait a sec. He probably shouldn&#x27;t
do that, being a kid and all.&#x22; Why did it take so long for the
government to respond to Abin Sur&#x27;s crash? His ship sits in the bay all
day without notice until Hal shows up. When a helicopter loses control
and beings spinning dangerously over an open crowd, why do they all
just stand there slack-jawed?! Why do so many things make no sense?! I
know I&#x27;m being nit-picky and a few questionable decisions are allowed
in movies in an effort to keep the ball rolling, but GREEN LANTERN is
full of so many that it&#x27;s distracting. There&#x27;s many, many more issues
with the plot but those can be found elsewhere if you&#x27;re interested. I
just wanted to emphasize how wrong this film had gone. DC had better
treat their Superman movie a little better if they&#x27;re hoping to get
anywhere in their film franchises once Batman&#x27;s done. I know the movie
was plagued with problems since the beginning and I have faith in
director Martin Campbell, seeing as how he made two of my favorite 007
movies. The director was talented, the cast did well enough with what
they were given, and the Green Lantern canon is full of awesome movie
ideas. So what went wrong? And more importantly, will they try a little
harder with the inevitable sequel?
