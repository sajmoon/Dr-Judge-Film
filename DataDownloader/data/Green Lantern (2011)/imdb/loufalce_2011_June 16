This is the 4th. superhero movie this year {Green Hornet, X Men,
Thor,so far-not including Captain America,and the worst. Total dud
misfires from the first frame. A cocky test pilot-whose father was
killed in an aircraft crash somehow gets to be a guardian of the
universe after a strange green light shines on him. Next thing you
know, he has to defend the world from bad evildoers who are much more
interesting than the title character. Ryan Reynolds is fairly likable
but he seems more appropriate in a show like &#x22;Glee&#x22; rather than in the
title role. Although he tries his one dimensional character really
shows no depth, even in the scenes with his lover. The CGI effects are
standard issue, and you&#x27;ve probably seen them a million times before.
The trouble with this movie is that its just sooooo ordinary. There is
absolutely nothing in it to lift it above a less than mediocre level,
and the story line can be somewhat hard to follow. Before my review
gets pulled due to &#x22;abuse&#x22;, heed my advice and avoid the multiplex
showing this disaster. Yes, I know its supposed to be based on a comic
book, but even comic books can sometimes show some character
development, intelligence, and try to portray their stories in a more
realistic and believable way. Unfortunately, this film does not. It
will just get lost in the shuffle of superhero overkill and fade from
the scene after it predictably makes a fortune on its first weekend. It
will be on DVD by summer&#x27;s end. If you must see it, wait until then.
Not worth your time or money, but don&#x27;t be too surprised if the
producers try to &#x22;franchise&#x22; it and milk it for all its worth. A sad
fact in todays Hollywood. The fans claim that the critics killed this
film , but thats only partially true. It committed suicide just being
made.However, this movie could have been much, much worse-it could have
had Jennifer Aniston in it.If that was the case, I would have given it
a zero star rating!
