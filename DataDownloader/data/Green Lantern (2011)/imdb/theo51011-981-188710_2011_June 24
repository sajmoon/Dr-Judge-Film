&#x22;Warner Brothers? This is Martin Campbell calling. Can you transfer me
to the Formula Department? Hello, Formula Department? This is Martin
Campbell. Can you please send me the superhero script and a green
marker?&#x22; <br /><br />50 years of great Hal Jordan Green Lantern stories. $200 million
budget. Computer animation. 3-frigging-D! You&#x27;d have to work hard, and
I mean really hard, to screw up this story. But guess what? Hollywood
didn&#x27;t disappoint.<br /><br />So the whole point, the entire premise of the comic books is that Hal
Jordan is fearless and honest. But taking that conceit and moving
forward would have required the filmmakers to do something ORIGINAL.
Can&#x27;t have that with a budget that size. Instead they got smart and
said let&#x27;s give them what they&#x27;ve seen 200 times before because we know
they&#x27;ll pay to see it again. So instead they make his character the
exact opposite of why he was popular in the comics. Why? Because that&#x27;s
the movie they they made yesterday, that&#x27;s the movie they&#x27;re making
today, and that&#x27;s the movie they&#x27;ll be making forever. Didn&#x27;t we just
go down this route with the surprisingly good Thor and the mediocre
Iron Man franchise?<br /><br />Why can&#x27;t they trust their source material? Face it, guys, it&#x27;s a comic
book. If you don&#x27;t like it, make a movie about something else. Don&#x27;t be
ashamed of it. Don&#x27;t try to make it Richard III. We don&#x27;t need all
these psychological nuances and back stories and explanations for
things that don&#x27;t need explaining. Didn&#x27;t they see the first Hulk
movie? <br /><br />I just don&#x27;t understand why Hollywood would spend $325 million to make
and market a comic book movie and then change the very concept that
made the story work in the first place. An hour and a half of this wuss
whining like a total jerk before he finally wakes up? What happened at
the first story meeting? Did some exec stand up and say, &#x22;I have a
great idea! Let&#x27;s make Hal a complete jerk at the beginning and then a
hero at the end! See, it&#x27;s character development. That makes the movie
important!&#x22; &#x22;Great idea, C.J.! That and the Subway Sandwich giveaways
glasses--I&#x27;m smelling hit here!&#x22; <br /><br />You know, in the end they didn&#x27;t even do anything creative with the
3-D. I thought they&#x27;d have constructs shooting out into the audience or
something. They did some great creative things with artwork in the
Green Lantern comic books, especially around the late 60s. Now I&#x27;m
wondering if anyone associated with this movie ever read a Green
Lantern comic book.<br /><br />This movie doesn&#x27;t merit a sequel, but Green Lantern deserves a second
chance. Come on, Warner Brothers, he&#x27;s a charter member of the Justice
League. Get a decent writer and a director with vision and try again.
You know if you spend less time trying to make all the money in the
world and more trying to make a great movie, you actually might make
some money by accident. Couldn&#x27;t you at least try it? Just one time?
