Another superhero bites the dust! I&#x27;ll make this quick! I wasn&#x27;t
expecting anything spectacular from DC&#x27;s latest offering. The first
trailer was garbage, the second showed promise where many fans
expressed doubts. But after watching Green Lantern yesterday, I should
have gone with my gut feeling and not bothered to watch this at all. <br /><br />WHAT I LIKED: <br /><br />Hardly anything, but the performances were OK. The fact that Ryan
Reynolds was picked in the first place to play Green Lantern, meant the
film was always going to be a jokey kind of comedy superhero movie.
Yeah fair enough, he&#x27;s got the acting chops from doing films like
Buried. But he was decent in this at best! Peter Sarsgaard did OK as
Hector Hammond, Angela Bassett still looking good after all these years
and Mark Strong again was great as Sinestro. It&#x27;s a shame he didn&#x27;t get
more screen time. It was fairly obviously he has the acting chops to
share top billing with Reynolds. Jay O Sanders and Tim Robbins were
passengers in this, but did OK with what they were given. The scenes
where Hal Jordan was being trained on the planet Oa, were good but too
short. The introduction Geoffrey Rush gives at the beginning of the
film was also very good. He has a great voice for storytelling and
would&#x27;ve been better served as a narrator than a bit part Green
Lantern. <br /><br />WHAT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE: <br /><br />Blake Lively for starters. Fine as she is, her acting is a lot to be
desired. Did a job playing messed up ex girlfriend in The Town, but was
missing in action in this. Don&#x27;t know what it is with these young
American actresses? Little exposure in Gossip Girl or One Tree Hill,
fans go crazy over them. Get a role in a lukewarm blockbuster like this
and they&#x27;re found wanting. To be fair, the script was also very poor.
But she currently belongs in the Scarlett Johannsen category. She just
looked good and offered little else. In fact her character is solely
responsible for how slow and boring this film becomes after the first
half hour. What was the point of her inclusion? This film is about Hal
Jordan becoming Green Latern. Not about his so called relationship with
some girl he grew up with. This is where the film fails and just gets
lost in its own mess. Green Lantern reminds me of some of the trash
Marvel used to bring out in the early 90&#x27;s. Dolph Lundgren&#x27;s Punisher
and Matt Salinger&#x27;s Captain America to name a few. I literally sat in
the cinema and was utterly surprised at how crap this film was. Set
pieces could&#x27;ve been better, the film was 20 mins too long and the
Parallax story which I cared very little for, was crap! Martin Campbell
as a director is top draw! Casino Royale, Goldeneye and The Mask of
Zorro. All three are well made action movies, with Casino Royale being
one of the best movies from the last decade. But what he&#x27;s done with
this, seems like a rush job. I sure he&#x27;ll redeem himself at some point,
just as long as he stays away from a sequel. And I pray there isn&#x27;t
one! But there&#x27;s a scene at the end of the credits that suggests there
will be a sequel. <br /><br />All in all, a DVD on a rainy Saturday night at best! My mate Terry was
right (which isn&#x27;t very often), I should&#x27;ve saved my money. <br /><br />If Green Lantern was anything like the the Green Latern First Flight
cartoon. It would&#x27;ve been a much better film. If anything, watch that
instead of this epileptic mess!
