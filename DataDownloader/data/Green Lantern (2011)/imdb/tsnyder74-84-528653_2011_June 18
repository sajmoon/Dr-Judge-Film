I believe this to be a great start to the Green Lantern story. Although
it wasn&#x27;t perfect, it left hope for what the story and series will
become. I enjoyed the way the constructs were shown and the flying
effects with the green glow that have always been GL symbols. The
choice of actors to play each character in the movie seemed to be &#x22;spot
on&#x22;. Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan...while at first I didn&#x27;t get it...I
realized after seeing Wolverine that he was a perfect choice, and
watching the movie only backed it up. Mark Strong as Sinestro looks was
another perfect choice. He air of &#x22;better than thou&#x22; comes off
brilliantly. <br /><br />After seeing the movie and realizing that this seems only to be the
beginning, I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am to hear about the next
installment and the beginning of the &#x22;Sinestro Corp&#x22;.
