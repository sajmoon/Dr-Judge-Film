You&#x27;ll never be mean? I actually have no idea, but if you find
something to rhyme this with, be my guest and use it! While I&#x27;m not
sure about the 3-D in the movie, I do know that I liked the movie
overall. Despite its flaws and faults. The female lead seems to have
too little to do and the family subplot seems almost irrelevant. But
you never know (unless it&#x27;s in the comics, which I only read a few when
I was a kid), if some of those things might get interesting in the
inevitable sequel.<br /><br />The effects are pretty good and our main guy is likable. There is the
funny/goofy friend and other things (like our hero&#x27;s arch) and the
actors obviously have fun with it all. Captain America was way better
though and might have gotten bad reviews because people were starting
to get fed up with comic book movies (which might be partly Green
Lanterns fault).<br /><br />One other thing: After the credits start to roll, stay put. A couple of
minutes into the credits there is a tag scene ... that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going
to say ... well that and the fact that after that, when the credits
start to roll again, this movie is over.
