I thought this movie was pretty good. If I had read the reviewers, I
might not have seen it, because they latched on some items and all
seemed to be repeating each other. There was an exposition at the
beginning that the reviewers seemed to hate, but it lasted only about
30 seconds, I don&#x27;t see what the big deal was. There was a lot of
action, and the graphics were quite good. The 3D was great, there
weren&#x27;t any 3d &#x22;thrill shots&#x22;, instead the 3D just made everything look
a little more real. While I liked the movie, and my younger daughters
liked it as well, my wife did not - she fell to sleep. So perhaps it&#x27;s
not for everyone. But I&#x27;d rate this the second best superhero movie
this year, after X-Men first class.
