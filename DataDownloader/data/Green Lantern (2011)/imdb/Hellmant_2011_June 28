&#x27;GREEN LANTERN&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five)<br /><br />Long awaited adaptation (by some) of the popular DC Comics character
Hal Jordan, the first human member of the &#x27;Guardians of the Universe&#x27;
and carrier of the team&#x27;s powerful ring which gives it&#x27;s possessor
amazing superpowers. Ryan Reynolds stars in the title role and Martin
Campbell (director of two well liked James Bond films, &#x27;CASINO ROYALE&#x27;
and &#x27;GOLDEN EYE&#x27;, and two Zorro films, &#x27;THE MASK OF ZORRO&#x27; and &#x27;THE
LEGEND OF ZORRO&#x27;) directs. The film co-stars the lovely Blake Lively,
Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett and was
written by a team of experienced TV writers. I enjoyed the film, for
what it was, but didn&#x27;t have too high expectations going in to it,
having not been a fan of the material previously.<br /><br />The first &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27; depicted in the comic books was actually Alan
Scott in the 1940&#x27;s (then published by All-American Publications). He
got his powers from a magical ring though and was not a member of the
&#x27;Guardians&#x27;. This film follows the adventures of the second &#x27;Green
Lantern&#x27; (Jordan) who was the first human member inducted into the
intergalactic police force known as the &#x27;Green Lantern Corps&#x27;, a team
of different alien races made up of inhabitants from planets across the
galaxy (all having made a pact to protect the universe). When the team
meets their greatest opponent yet, an unstoppable force known as
Parallax which sucks the life-force from all that gets in it&#x27;s way,
they&#x27;re forced with recruiting a human for the first time (who have
never been deemed worthy before). Hal is an arrogant and somewhat self
centered test pilot who seems like the least likely choice to fill
their requirements but when he&#x27;s put to the test a true hero is born.<br /><br />The film is full of dazzling visuals and is some of the best 3D yet for
a film, this is almost unarguably it&#x27;s strongest point. The action
early on is pretty thrilling and intense but the pacing and overall
plot involvement becomes pretty bogged down by the third act. None of
the characters really standout or feel very relatable and the
performances are adequate at best. Reynolds is a great leading man and
has definitely proved himself to be capable of much more than slapstick
comedy over the years but here his talents are mostly wasted. He fits
the cocky pilot role but isn&#x27;t given much of any emotional depth to
work with. He&#x27;s also too well known to be playing a character like
this. You never believe he&#x27;s not Ryan Reynolds playing the &#x27;Green
Lantern&#x27;. Lively looks beautiful and her and Reynolds make a very
pretty couple but beyond that they show no chemistry. Still the film is
breathtaking to watch and for the most part pretty fun; it does do a
good job of capturing the inner child thrill at least. Not knowing much
about the characters or their mythology and having no high expectations
I can&#x27;t say I was really disappointed with the film at all; it does
deliver the summer popcorn entertainment it promises. It&#x27;s definitely
not as good as recent high caliber comic book superhero films (like
&#x27;THOR&#x27; and &#x27;X-MEN: FIRST CLASS&#x27;) but it&#x27;s still a decent addition to
the genre. Definitely worth seeing if you&#x27;re a fan of these types of
films or just visually stunning eye-candy in general.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
