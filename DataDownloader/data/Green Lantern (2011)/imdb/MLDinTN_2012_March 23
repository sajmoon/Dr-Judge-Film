I didn&#x27;t care for this movie. First, Blake Lively was horrible in this.
She does nothing, adds nothing to the story, and was by far the worst
written leading lady character in any action film. And the only thing
Ryan Reynolds had going for him was the scene in his tidy whiteys.<br /><br />One problem I had was how did Hal fly threw space with no oxygen and
live. That whole part was beyond silly to me. I mean he&#x27;s still human
but has special powers supplied by a ring. And the bad guy sucked.
There was nothing memorable about him.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: A far far cry from movies like Spiderman, Batman, or
even the Hulk. I can&#x27;t recommend it.
