DC Comics has not had much luck in the live action film business.
Unless it&#x27;s a Batman film made by Christopher Nolan, they just can&#x27;t
get anything off the ground. Superman is going on his second reboot in
the ten years. The Justice League idea keeps crashing and burning. And
Wonder Woman can&#x27;t get anything going no matter who&#x27;s working on it.
It&#x27;s pretty sad when Swamp Thing has two movies while top tier heroes
like Flash and Martian Manhunter haven&#x27;t seen the light of film. Since
Marvel has been, for better or worse, adapting every hero they have,
DC/WB needed something to get back in the game. Green Lantern seems
like a terrific fit for a summer blockbuster. Big flashy effects, epic
stories, and just two years ago the GL-centered Blackest Night event
took the comic book world by storm. So how is the movie itself?<br /><br />First things first, the movie&#x27;s biggest problem is the story. It&#x27;s not
a bad story on its own. It&#x27;s biggest fault is that it&#x27;s the exact same
origin story we&#x27;ve seen dozens of times in the past decade. Man with
problematic life, tragic accident, gets powers, overcomes personal
weaknesses, fights bad guy, love interest thrown in just for fun, and
set up for sequel (usually in that order). Superman, Spider-Man,
Daredevil, Punisher, Fantastic Four, Batman Begins, Ghost Rider, and
Iron Man have all used that same basic set-up. For comic book readers,
we&#x27;re just glad to see our favorite heroes on the big screen. But for
the average film-goer who don&#x27;t know their Doctor Strange from Hawkman,
this can be quite repetitive and boring. Audiences can only take the
same story so many times. Superman and Spider-Man came out before it
got old while Batman Begins and Iron Man were intelligent and fun
enough that it didn&#x27;t seem like the same thing over again. Sadly, Green
Lantern fails to elevate itself outside of the visuals.<br /><br />The story is an adaptation of Geoff John&#x27;s Secret Origins. It&#x27;s the
same basic story but the changes make it more of the clich&#xE9;d origin
film. I&#x27;m not saying they needed to do a Snyder&#x27;s 300-style adaptation,
but they didn&#x27;t seem to grasp what made Nolan&#x27;s adaptation of Batman:
Year One so lovable. If they stayed a bit closer to the comics, it
would have been able to stand out more from the crowd. It&#x27;s mostly
minor stuff like Hal&#x27;s history, his relationship with Carol, and his
connection with Carl Ferris that added some dynamics to the story that
the movie misses out on.<br /><br />I saw the movie in 3D and it looked terrific. I wouldn&#x27;t expect less in
this day and age. From the constructs to Oa to alien species,
everything looks terrific. All of the characters look spot-on and there
are many cameos for long-time readers. I never did like the CGI suits,
and still don&#x27;t, but they look fine in the movie. My only complaint is
that there are a couple shaky cam shots that, in 3D, can make you
nauseous. But if this film doesn&#x27;t get a nomination for Best Visual
Effects, I will be disappointed.<br /><br />Green Lantern has much in common with this year&#x27;s earlier Thor. Both
comic characters are very powerful, have large expansive universes that
are often separate from their fellow heroes, and are little known to
non-comic readers. However, Thor spent a great deal of time in Asgard
whereas GL only spends what seems like a day on Oa. Also, Thor spent
time developing side characters like Sif and the Warriors Three. GL has
Kilowog, Tomar-Re, and the Guardians but they&#x27;re mostly cameos for
exposition.<br /><br />The characters are pretty much spot-on with terrific acting all around.
Reynolds is great. He&#x27;s a little more of his usual comical self than is
right for the role, but he isn&#x27;t goofy or just a Green Deadpool.
However, Hal is a bit inconsistent making me believe that restored
deleted scenes would make the movie better. Blake Lively is fine and
works well with Reynolds. Though her character most of all should have
been more like Secret Origins. Sarsgaard has fun with Hammond both
before and after his mutation. Though it&#x27;s Strong who steals the show
as Hal&#x27;s mentor and future rival Sinestro. He nailed the personality
and there are certainly hints of his eventual fall from grace. I just
wish that, like the other Lanterns, he had more to do. The rest all do
fine jobs.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews, many of them downright
hostile, but I don&#x27;t think it deserves the beating it&#x27;s getting. It&#x27;s
certainly not a great film, like I just have to see it again in
theaters. But it&#x27;s a good film that I&#x27;ll gladly buy when it comes out.
It&#x27;s one of the better middle-ground movies, neither bad nor terrific
but entertaining nonetheless.
