Short and sweet. This was nothing but a copy of Green Lantern:First
Flight the animated film. If you have seen that you get nothing but
seeing actors pretend to be cartoons. Can&#x27;t really say anything more
about it. They just replaced all the animated characters with actors.
Save yourself the trouble and watch the animated &#x22;version&#x22; of this film
at least then you will see something more in line with the
comics...There is nothing new here at all other than Hollywood grandeur
certainly nothing to make this film worthwhile. I guess to people who
have no previous connection to anything to do with Green Lantern this
might be entertaining but I just felt like I was watching a rerun
having already seen First Flight...
