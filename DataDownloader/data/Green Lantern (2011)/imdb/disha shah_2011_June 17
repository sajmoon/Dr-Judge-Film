this movie has to be the worst of the comic book stories presented in a
movie form. Ryan Reynolds is a great actor and I am bit baffled as to
why he would even consider doing a film as such, He went from acting
with A -list star like Sandra Bullock to non competent actress like
Blake who? lively? she was not at all lively, sorry this actress cannot
act, she doesn&#x27;t posses the star like quality like scarlet Johansson,
Sandra bullock has, Blake lively is another reason why this movie
shocked me, an actress that will beg and go out of her way to get a
role that&#x27;s not up to her level which eventually fail and that was the
only thing she has ever convinced me thus far. Bad actress who loves
all the wrong attention. the only thing good about this movie is the
color green. hopefully no sequel to this movie. Terrible actress with
an OK genre made the movie extremely dissatisfying...
