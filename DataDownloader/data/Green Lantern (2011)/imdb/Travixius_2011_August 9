&#x22;Worst comic movie ever&#x22;. &#x22;Worst acting&#x22;, &#x22;Worst effects&#x22; are some of
the phrases being slapped around about Green Lantern. I&#x27;ll recount some
gems you may have forgotten &#x22;Elektra&#x22;, &#x22;Catwoman&#x22;, &#x22;Batman and Robin&#x22;
(The Schumacher one) and &#x22;Howard the Duck&#x22;. Get my drift. No GL is not
that bad at all, in fact it is kinder to it&#x27;s fans than the first
Spiderman movie was. The fact of the matter is there is no way of
putting Hal Jordan on celluloid without an element of &#x22;kiddishness&#x22;,
(just wait till they attempt an Aquaman movie). Here they went ahead
and just did Green Lantern as per the printed, without trying to
reality up the guy like Nolan did with &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; because you
just can&#x27;t, with what is essentially a space opera. With garbage like
Sucker Punch around I am astounded at the reaction to this film which
provides a solid story and decent visuals. Just a tip, watch the
animated movie GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT to get acquainted with the
character before this movie, especially if you know nothing about
Lantern mythology. You&#x27;ll realise then that they got this pretty right.
