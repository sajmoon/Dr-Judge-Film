Surprisingly this film was better than I thought. Due to the reviews
online, I nearly did not want to see this and probably would have
waited until the bluray version came out. I am glad to say this film
met my expectations and was sure fun to watch.<br /><br />I chose to see the 2d version, after finding out that the movie was
actually filmed in 2d and later converted to 3d. After watching clash
of the titans 3d and alice in wonderland 3d, I was definitely not
falling foul to this false economy.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the story. This is once again, a nice movie of a comic
book. Green Lantern, Hal is the earth super hero and defending the
earth.<br /><br />The visuals are actually amazing and keeps to the nice expectations of
most.<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t want to spoil anyone&#x27;s hope of missing this film.<br /><br />The film is good. It is not better than the new x-men film but it is&#x27;nt
far from being good.<br /><br />The only thing I would say would be that the film was not long enough
to concentrate on the main mission of the story. It started of fast,
slowed down and finished to fast with a high.<br /><br />Also, for people who will be watching this, please hang around after
the credits!
