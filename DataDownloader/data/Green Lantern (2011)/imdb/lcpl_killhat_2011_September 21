Serious cult classic potential with its snazzy but unmemorable special
effects. Bonus 1 star for 3D otherwise 0 stars. The dialog and acting
are TERRIBLE (Peter Sarsgaard&#x27;s performance is OK), the chemistry
between Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively is completely not happening. Its
completely not happening with any of the characters, i feel like an
awkward third wheel in every scene. The writing is chock FULL OF
clich&#xE9;s and inane attempts to drag the story along, and the characters
are astoundingly underdeveloped one dimensional . 50 years from now
when our grandchildren are taking their dates to the drive-in in their
flying cars this is the kind of movie they&#x27;ll be making out to.
