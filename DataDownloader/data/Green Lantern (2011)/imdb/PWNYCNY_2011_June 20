This movie is fluff. Even allowing for the comic-book format, the movie
lacks substance. This movie is geared for the pre-teen audience. It
offers a lot of cartoon-like special effects with lines spoken by
cartoon-like characters. At no time does this movie approach the level
of an adult story. Every scene is dominated by all kind of flashy
lights and some absurd attempts at drama. This movie borrows the most
embarrassing features of other comic-book based movies and combines
them to produce this unsatisfactory product. Both Ryan Reynolds and
Blake Lively give good performances, but really have little material to
fully demonstrate their acting skills. The problem with the movie is
not the cast, it is the way the story is presented. It is apparent that
the director had opted to sacrifice substance for flashiness, which is
okay from a marketing vantage point but makes for a superficial
interpretation of a comic book story which itself is not exactly
Shakespeare. In short, if you decide to watch this movie, take along a
companion to let you know what you missed while you were napping.
