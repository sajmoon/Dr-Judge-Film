We&#x27;re all a little spoiled with our movie-going experiences these days,
I feel. Even without the CGI (which was spectacular) and the cast
(which had several fan favorites, both as characters and the actors
portraying them), this movie would have been a serious contender not
ten years ago. We&#x27;ve had a glut of superhero movies in the last decade,
some phenomenally good (The Dark Knight, Iron Man) and some
phenomenally bad (Catwoman, X-Men 3: The Last Stand). We&#x27;ve adopted a
sort of attitude that a superhero movie isn&#x27;t &#x22;good&#x22; unless it&#x27;s
&#x22;great&#x22;. Sure, we can say to ourselves and each other that we never
expected it to be on par with Christopher Nolan&#x27;s films, but that&#x27;s
exactly what we wanted it to be. And that&#x27;s exactly what it didn&#x27;t need
to be.<br /><br />GL tells the story of a cocky test pilot, Hal Jordan, who manages to
disappoint several people close to him by crashing his plane during a
test. Despite this apparent failure on his part, the risks he was
willing to take during the test demonstrate the sort of indomitable
will Hal possesses that makes him worthy to enter the Green Lantern
Corps.<br /><br />Hal is the first human being to ever be chosen for the Corps. We&#x27;re a
&#x22;young&#x22; species, unaware of any life beyond our own planet, and rather
arrogant, besides. That makes some of its more prominent members,
Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Sinestro (Mark Strong), doubtful
that Hal can fulfill his duties; especially since the Lantern he
replaced was Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison), their greatest warrior. In
the face of their skepticism and even hostility towards him, even Hal
begins to doubt that he belongs.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back on Earth, Abin Sur&#x27;s dead body has been recovered by
the government. Killed and infected by the dreaded being Parallax, he
is examined by scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), who also
becomes infected and begins to exhibit strange powers of his own as a
result. Jordan and Hammond are seemingly polar opposites: one so
self-assured and charismatic that he can do anything he wants, and the
other so brilliant and yet so timid that all he can do is dream of what
he wants. It&#x27;s a dynamic that sounds clich&#xE9;, but that fits easily into
the storyline and their eventual confrontation. The problem is the
movie doesn&#x27;t spend enough time building their chemistry and
relationship on screen.<br /><br />Actually, the movie doesn&#x27;t have much time to spend on anything. It&#x27;s
only an hour and forty-five minutes, which, given how much ground (and
space) they need to cover, is not enough. It needed to be at least
twenty minutes longer, not just to give the characters more time to
develop, but also to smooth out some very awkward segues between
scenes.<br /><br />Not that everything about the movie was awkward or rushed. I actually
think they did a good job with Carol Ferris&#x27; (Blake Lively)
relationship with Hal throughout the movie. They establish their
childhood friendship, their past as lovers, and their current balancing
act as best friends and pseudo-employer/employee. She&#x27;s positioned to
take over her father&#x27;s company, so she needs to put her foot down about
Hal&#x27;s seemingly careless attitude sometimes; but she still helps him
realize the difference between being fearless and being able to
overcome fear; which is the one lesson he needs to learn if he is ever
to live up to the responsibility entrusted to him with and by the power
ring. The only real misfire with her character, again, was with her
relationship with Hector Hammond. It&#x27;s another aspect of their
particular triangle that could have worked, if only they&#x27;d been given
more time.<br /><br />More time is exactly what this franchise needs. It laid a significant
amount of groundwork for a trilogy, especially with the character of
Sinestro and his ruthless pursuit of what he considers to be the right
path to justice. It gave Hal Jordan an opportunity to grow from willful
to full of will. It was sort of the Iron Man 2 of the franchise (if,
indeed, it becomes a franchise): more setup for what&#x27;s ahead than
establishment of what is; more flash than substance, though it
certainly did not lack for substance. DC and WB should not be afraid to
follow up with a sequel or even a full trilogy; because, as Hal reminds
us in the movie, &#x22;once you give in to fear, you can never go back&#x22;.
They want to branch out from Superman and Batman? They want to compete
with the Avengers and Marvel&#x27;s full slate of superhero movies, both
planned and current? Then they need to give Green Lantern time to grow
into his role. They need to take another chance, another risk, as they
did when they made this one in the first place. Now is the time to give
the franchise the support it needs. Just making this movie was a
courageous effort; it will take even more courage to move forward from
here.<br /><br />(originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)
