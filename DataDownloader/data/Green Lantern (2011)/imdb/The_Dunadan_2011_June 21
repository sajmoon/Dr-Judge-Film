I&#x27;ve been reading in the past few days tons of reviews about this movie
and how it doesn&#x27;t fill expectations.<br /><br />Yesterday, after seeing it myself, I went to bed wondering if all those
reviewers had seen the same amazing movie I saw.<br /><br />I am a HUGE Green Lantern fan, and had been waiting years to see this
come to the screen. I was really excited when I knew it was finally
being made. Not that excited when I read about Ryan Reynolds. But
yesterday, I just shut my mouth and saw a feast... an Emerald Feast.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is NOT thought to be in the same vein as &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22;. It is NOT intended to be a realistic psychological portrayal
of s society and an anti-hero that rises. It is the opening point to an
intergalactic saga of epic proportions in which our core sense of
morals, duty and responsibility need to be questioned.<br /><br />This movie is screaming in your face &#x22;Hey, this is only the beginning!&#x22;<br /><br />I remember when I saw &#x22;The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring&#x22; back in 2001. Some people said &#x22;Oh, what a waste of time. They
didn&#x27;t even destroy the ring!&#x22;<br /><br />My answer was &#x22;What letter of the word TRILOGY you didn&#x27;t understand?&#x22;<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is CLEARLY the STARTING POINT for an epic story that
will continue developing in its sequels (just like &#x22;Star Wars: A New
Hope&#x22;).<br /><br />So if you have been worrying thinking this is a mess, trust me: it is
NOT... It&#x27;s GREAT. To me, better than &#x22;Thor&#x22; and on the same level as
&#x22;X-Men: First Class.&#x22;<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds suits the role perfectly as Hal Jordan, and you can
definitely see a process in him, his journey to become a hero as he
deals with his own fears.<br /><br />Blake Lively is really hot and delivers a right performance, much to be
developed in further sequels too.<br /><br />Mark Strong and Peter Saarsgard are great. They hit the spot perfectly
in their roles.<br /><br />This movie is definitely now on the top of my FAVORITE superhero films.<br /><br />Said again, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; isn&#x27;t about dark realism and crime, like
Batman, it&#x27;s about... LIGHT in galactic proportions, and how you can
discover your most courageous side in times of despair. It&#x27;s a true
HERO movie, much like Christopher Reeve&#x27;s &#x22;Superman&#x22; was back in 1978.<br /><br />I cross my fingers hoping that a Director&#x27;s Cut will be released. This
movie could easily last 3 hours. I never saw the clock once.<br /><br />There&#x27;s too much to cover and too little time. But, despite of this,
Martin Campbell manages to give us a solid story that, as I said
before, is just the germ of further development.<br /><br />So just grab a snack, sit down and enjoy. And get ready for some great
&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; sequels.<br /><br />In brightest day, in blackest night, mates!
