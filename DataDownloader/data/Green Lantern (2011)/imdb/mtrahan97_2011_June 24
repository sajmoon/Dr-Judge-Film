Keep in mind that I am entitled to my own opinion.<br /><br />I know that my review is a week late but i&#x27;m still sure some people can
find it useful.<br /><br />I am not a comic book reader, and I only know Green Lantern as an
African-American with cool jewelry on TV. However, I saw this movie
because an audio podcast I listen to was going to review it and I
wanted to have seen the film before listening. If they wouldn&#x27;t have
reviewed it, I probably would never have seen this. But since I have, I
may as well review it to answer your question, &#x22;Should I see this movie
instead of seeing X-Men: First Class a second or third time?&#x22; And my
answer to that is a weak &#x22;Maybe.&#x22; <br /><br />I had very low to mediocre expectations. I expected it to be either one
of two things: <br /><br />*a fun B- movie that I could enjoy as I watched it and have no
aftertaste <br /><br />*an awful D or D+ guilty pleasure movie that I could get a good laugh
out of (i.e. Ghost Rider or Daredevil) <br /><br />And truthfully, I didn&#x27;t get either. Instead I got a bland mediocre
superhero movie which has nothing new to it. I only unintentionally
laughed once (when we first see Paralax) and only two or three times
did I intentionally laughed at Ryan Reynolds (I can&#x27;t recall when they
were though. That&#x27;s a good sign right?).<br /><br />If you read my reviews you would know I usually give detailed
spoiler-filled reviews. But here there is just nothing to say. How was
Reynolds? Fine. How was Lively? Hot and fine. How was the plot? Lame
but not laughable. How were the effects? Good and bad at points.<br /><br />So if it&#x27;s fine, should you see it? I say it is a good rental or
airplane movie. It&#x27;s just something to keep you occupied for an hour
and forty-five minutes, but it isn&#x27;t a must see by any means of the
imagination. So I guess that&#x27;s a pass for me.<br /><br />P.S. If you are going to see this movie in the theater, do yourself a
favor: DO NOT SEE IT IN 3-D!! IT IS TERRIBLE!! Besides a few orbs and
things in the beginning, all that they did was make the characters pop
out. It wasn&#x27;t good at all.
