Initially thinking this blockbuster will be hollow and without depth, I
was proved wrong by watching this fantastic superhero film. Ryan
Reynolds surprised me because let&#x27;s face it, he&#x27;s not exactly Oscar
worthy, yet he managed to play Hal Jordan really well and not as
shallow as I thought he would be. Even Blake Lively was amazing as Hals
love interest, she was brilliant in her role. This film was clever in
sticking to the true conventions of a true superhero film: It has the
normal guy turned hero, villain created, fighting scenes, final
conflict, love interest etc. It had all those great definitions of a
fun superhero film which really hasn&#x27;t been seen since &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22;
(2002) Another great positive was that it was not rude, there was no
swearing, it was a clean, fun, great film. &#x22;The Green Lantern&#x22; wasn&#x27;t
afraid to show how awesome his powers were, the special effects were
awesome and the things the Green Lantern could do was brilliant. The
fighting scenes, conflict of good and evil was evident and brilliantly
executed. I know on the surface the film looks cheap and terrible, but
I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film as I wasn&#x27;t wasting
almost two hours of my life, but instead I was enjoying two hours of my
life.
