Just watched this DC Comics-based superhero movie featuring Green
Lantern with my movie theatre-working friend which we both enjoyed. As
the title character&#x27;s alter ego Hal Jordan, Ryan Reynolds is the right
mix of arrogance and compassion with a wonderful sense of humor. As the
beautiful brunette Carol Ferris who is the heiress of the Ferris
aircraft not to mention one of its best pilots, Blake Lively brings
such a lovely presence and a great can-do attitude that proves more
than a perfect match with Reynolds when the latter expresses some doubt
about his new abilities. Then there&#x27;s Peter Sarsgaard as the eccentric
Dr. Hector who has his own transformation from someone likable to
someone really creepy when he gets possessed. Other interesting
characters were Sinestro (Mark Strong) who becomes GL&#x27;s mentor, and
Kilowog (voice of Michael Clarke Duncan in his second stint in a comic
book-inspired movie after playing The Kingpin in Daredevil) who trains
GL&#x27;s battle skills. In summary, Green Lantern was just the right mix of
the fun and serious action that probably could have used a slightly
longer running time but it was still enjoyable enough as it stood,
thanks to the script and Martin Campbell&#x27;s direction. So on that note,
it&#x27;s well worth a look. P.S. If I didn&#x27;t read about it already, I
wouldn&#x27;t have known this movie was partly shot in New Orleans which is
just a two-hour drive from where I currently live. Also, when a
reporter on a TV screen was identified as Melanie Hebert, she looked
liked the same woman I once viewed several years back in the last
decade on WVLA-TV 33. I guess New Orleans is her beat now...
