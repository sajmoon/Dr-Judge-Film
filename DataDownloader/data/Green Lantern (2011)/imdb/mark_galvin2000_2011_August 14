I am upset, but not because of this movie. I am upset that every time
someone goes to watch a superhero movie these days they are expecting
the next Dark Knight. Critics expect the next Dark Knight and a lot of
movie goers like to pretend they are critics.<br /><br />Green Lantern is not the next Dark Knight but importantly it is not
trying to be. It is however desperately trying to be DC&#x27;s answer to
Iron Man. Let&#x27;s face it with the exception of Batman&#x27;s recent on screen
exploits DC have been left floundering following the quite frankly
brilliant Marvel Studios movie adaptations (the incredible Hulk being
the exception). So does it deliver? Well yes and no. I will be honest
with you now, the movie is laden with clich&#xE9;s, some of the dialogue is
cheesy and it does kick off at fairly unreasonable pace for the
uninitiated.<br /><br />If you have read any Green Lantern comic books you will be familiar
with the premise. If you haven&#x27;t you will feel a little left out to
start with but my advice is to stick with it (it gets easier to follow
after the first 10 minutes). There is humour that sometimes feel forced
but for the most part there was an appropriate amount of laughs in the
cinema.<br /><br />Mark Strong and Blake Lively were great in their respective roles but I
did feel that Ryan Reynolds could have pulled out a few more stops in
some of his scenes. The rest of the cast, to their credit, give solid
performances.<br /><br />All in all this is a movie that hit the target in so many areas but in
others missed (but just slightly). If you want a movie that is not
clich&#xE9; ridden with cheesy dialogue, see something that isn&#x27;t a
superhero movie. If you are prepared to switch your brain to popcorn
and have fun, climb aboard.<br /><br />DC&#x27;s answer to Iron Man? Not quite, but it did a damn good Thor. To
steal some now immortal words from another DC franchise &#x22;Why so
serious?&#x22; Lighten up everyone and remember how to have fun.
