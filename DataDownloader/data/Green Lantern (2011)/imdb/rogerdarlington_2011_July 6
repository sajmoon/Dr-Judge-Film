I&#x27;m not a reader of comic books but I enjoy a good super-hero movie and
recognise that comics are a rich source of characters for such films.
Marvel has given us the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man, X-Men and Thor,
while DC Comics has been racing to catch up with Superman, Batman and
now &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;. Since most of these are franchises, that&#x27;s one
huge battery of super-heroes and new movies inevitably struggle to
differentiate themselves and offer something new.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is entertaining enough but lacks distinction.
Character-wise, it is hardly special. We have the usual alter-ego, a
human with childhood issues and a disbelieving girlfriend, although at
least Hal Jordan (a lantern-jawed Ryan Reynolds) is a cocky test pilot
with &#x27;the right stuff&#x27;. We have the familiar evil destroyer which in
this case looks strangely like the dust cloud that raced through the
streets of New York City after the collapse of the Twin Towers
(deliberate?).<br /><br />Filmed on location in Sector 2814 of the Universe, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;
scores in scenes set on the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, but
is at its weakest when it tries to be funny. I saw it in 3D which
worked well for many sequences - and even for the early credits when a
short scene sets us up for the inevitable sequel.
