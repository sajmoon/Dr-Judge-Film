The film is about a pilot who had an accident , discovered an alien who
got crashed too , and decided to help him. And alien gave the power he
has to him trough the ring.<br /><br />What got this film so wrong is that the film is only a film. It feels
too animated, and it doesn&#x27;t live in our heart. Even animated can move
our feeling.<br /><br />On the paper, it seems like Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice. But,
he made Hal Jordan look annoying and doesn&#x27;t get my sympathy, I think
i&#x27;m not the only one with this.<br /><br />And the love story is so cheesy. There are two element that actually
bumped this a little bit, Mark Strong and the Make-Up department.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a DC Comics Fans, be ready for the worst.
