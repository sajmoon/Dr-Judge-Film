In my opinion, Green Lantern was quite good despite the fact that many
people dislike it. The director was too focused on Hal&#x27;s life which
left the complete explanation on the planet Oa left unexplained. I was
hoping for Hal Jordan to spend more time in training, and more
one-on-one combats with the other Green Lanterns. However, Hal&#x27;s
training at planet Oa was too short and it is quite illogical to think
that he mastered the ring&#x27;s power without even training. If the
director extends the movie for a longer duration, maybe more complete
explanation would help although I have seen the extended edition. Well,
I wish for a better sequel if there is. <br /><br />The planet Oa looked quite unrealistic compared to Asgard which was
perfect in Thor. But still, the effects used, and CGI applied was great
and must be praised. The acting by the way, was great, Ryan Reynolds
did great as Hal Jordan, even though certain parts made him looked a
bit not superhero. His face was lack of confidence and sometimes he
failed to perform more emotions on few scenes. As you know, the
character Hal Jordan was actually should be filled with more emotions,
his father died, trouble with his job, love with Carol and more. Blake
lively however, did great even though certain parts should made her
show more expression especially when Hal was leaving to fight the
Parallax. Overall, this movie is a fun movie to fill your free time but
can be made better with better effort.
