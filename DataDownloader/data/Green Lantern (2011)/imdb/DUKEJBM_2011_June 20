Green Lantern is a convoluted mess that has rightfully received venom
from every film critic. Most are getting it right and correctly
labeling it trash. This director isn&#x27;t a filmmaker, he&#x27;s a disc jockey.
I can&#x27;t believe a movie with this type of cartoonish action, which
makes about as much sense as a drunken Swedish prostitute, is getting
even one good review. This thing is utter nonsense that can&#x27;t and
shouldn&#x27;t be appreciated on any level.<br /><br />Green Lantern wants to be taken seriously, at least at times. It has
aspirations of being something better but the subject material simply
won&#x27;t let it. A talking gold fish alien man imparting wisdom and a
villain that looks like a poo cloud with a cartoon head for heaven&#x27;s
sake??? Then, it shelves the fun and is a terrible mix with dull
results. It&#x27;s like they threw everything at the screen in hopes that
something would stick. A &#x22;funny&#x22; line attempt here, a bad but brief CG
action sequence there, a dull turn everywhere... Not fun enough, not
funny enough and not smart enough, it&#x27;s caught in no man&#x27;s land. The
writers of this thing deliver a predictable, hackneyed, and
astonishingly unentertaining script. This one is truly as bad as most
are saying and deserves all the venom it has generated.
