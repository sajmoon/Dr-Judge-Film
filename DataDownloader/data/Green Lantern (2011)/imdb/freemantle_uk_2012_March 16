Superhero films are a common stable of blockbuster cinema ever since
2000: but it is a genre that dominated by Marvel and DC have been
lagging behind. The Christopher Nolan Batman films have been their only
real success. DC and Warner Brothers hoped to redress the balance by
starting up the Green Lantern series.<br /><br />For millions of years they has been a organisation that has been
guarding the universe, The Guardian. They have been able to cultivate
the green energy of willpower and form it into rings for people who are
fearless to act as a galactic police force, the Green Lantern Corp. But
an old threat has re-emerged, the entity of yellow fear, Parallax
(Clancy Brown) and it able to kill the Lantern&#x27;s best agent Abin Sur
(Temuera Morrison).<br /><br />On Earth Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a arrogant test pilot who is a
very immature and reckless. He seems a unlikely candidate to be Abin
Sur&#x27;s replacement, but he is the next Green Lantern, the first human to
earn the role. He has to learn quickly on the planet of Oa, being
overwhelmed by his new responsibilities.<br /><br />Also on Earth a secret government organisation find Abin Sur&#x27;s body and
biologist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) has to do the autopsy. But
during it he is infected with some of Parallax&#x27;s DNA. Hammond develops
psychic powers and Parallax&#x27;s dark side affects him.<br /><br />As you can tell there is a lot of different story elements and the film
makers did not seem to know where to focus their attend. Even in the
Extended Cut it was a lot and the Extended Cut was only around a hour
and 50 minutes. Sometimes films can fit a lot in a short package like
Wall-E, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and X-Men, but Green Lantern
does not seen to manage that. The seems to be a clash of tones, from
being very serious and dark to a be light and humorous. I am sure that
Martin Campbell wanted to make a serious film seeing he is normally a
serious director but the producers saw the success of Iron Man, one of
Marvel&#x27;s lesser know characters and he was turned into a successful
film series and wanted make a more lighter film. The tonal shift was
particularly noticeable between the scenes on Earth and the scenes in
space.<br /><br />As a film Green Lantern did not know who to focus on, having too major
villains that do not really do much. We have Hammond who could have
been a mirror to the Hal Jordon, having to get use to the new powers he
has acquired and acting as a origin story for him as well. Or the story
could have focused on the unstoppable force that is needs the whole of
the Green Lantern Corp to stop them, forcing their leader Sinestro
(Mark Strong) to explore his dark side, foreshadowing his turn as a
villain in a sequel. There was not a right balance on who to focus on.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is not the best choice as the leading man. He looked the
part but he was too comic for the most part and that did not fit the
role. He is meant to be a former air force pilot but he did not seem
like he was ex-military, particularly someone who is meant to be a
handling multi-million dollar jets he too reckless. He gets a bit
better near the end as he becomes more serious but he is not Robert
Downey Jr. like he was trying to be. He came off more like Chris Evans&#x27;
version of Johnny Storm. Blake Lively seems too young for the role and
that is being kind, because she was not a good actress. Sarsgaard was
hamming it up when he was meant to be playing a more tortured
character. The best performers were from the aliens, Strong (who is
always a professional), Morrison, Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke
Duncan who in no more then a cameo. Most of the cast did not seem to
put their heart in this film compared to say the X-Men films, Nolan&#x27;s
Batman or the new Bond fans.<br /><br />Whilst it is clear that Campbell is not a special effects director he
does provide some good if slightly cartoony and the action was well
handled for the most part. A problem was that the Green Lantern was not
very inventive with his psychic creations and felt a bit cheesy,
particular with the car and racetrack. I know it was a troubled
production and Campbell was very public about his disdain for 3D and
well, he was not the right director for the project. He did his best,
but he is known for making more grounded, gritty work like he did with
the Bond series. Green Lantern needed a director that could take you to
another world like what Kenneth Brangh did with Thor or Peter Jackson
and Ridley Scott are constantly good at. Another similarity to Iron Man
was a revel at the midway point of something (I won&#x27;t say what) which
turns out to be very useful later on.<br /><br />As an origin story this Green Lantern offers us nothing we have not
seen before. There are problems involving character development and
even with the extended cut some elements felt like they were left out.
Admittedly Green Lantern is a harder sell to mainstream audiences then
some other superhero characters and DC do what Joss Wheadon calls a God
complex with them having very powerful heroes. As superhero film it is
not the best but still better then say the Fantastic Four. It was just
a bit generic blockbuster.
