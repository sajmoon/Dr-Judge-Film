I thought it was pretty good. Probably because I had low expectations
to begin with, after seeing the trailer and hearing the reviews. The
trailer did a good job in preparing me for what to expect-- lots of
cartoonish CGI and a bland, insincere Ryan Reynolds. Despite this, I
still enjoyed the film. I put it ahead of the Fantastic Four but
behind, of course, the X-Men 1 &#x26; 2, First Class, Iron Man, Thor and
Captain America.<br /><br />Tim Robbins was good and so was Blake Lively, even though she didn&#x27;t
make a convincing fighter pilot. It was her chemistry with Reynolds
that made her an asset. More could&#x27;ve been done with Hal Jordan growing
into the Green Lantern job, and the defeat of the bad guy could&#x27;ve been
more challenging, but overall it was an enjoyable film.
