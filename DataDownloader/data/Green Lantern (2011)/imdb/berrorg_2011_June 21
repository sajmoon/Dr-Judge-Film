I was going to reply this to a person who was criticizing this movie
with a number of objections, all based on its implausibility, but I
figured my point of view would maybe help some people to make a
decision whether they should support or turn their backs on a movie
like Green Lantern. X-Men, the Avengers&#x27; movies (Iron Man, Thor, Hulk,
etc.) and the new Batman movies (especially the Batman movies!) are
strongly anchored in our reality, and that&#x27;s a good thing, it gives
credibility to the story and characters, taking away the burden from
the spectator to suspend disbelief by showing everyday situations,
locations and people as the basis of the fictional world where they
then unleash the presence of a superhero. I love the movies mentioned
above, but this is not the only way these movies can be done. This
style appeals mostly to people who, like me, have gone through the
totally fantastic worlds of the old superheroes movies and comic books,
and now crave something more &#x22;mature&#x22;. But what about our kids?? Why
would we stole these superheros from them just for our enjoyment? I&#x27;m
not saying that these new superheroes movies are not appropriate for
young kids, I have kids and they love most of them, but they, as most
kids I know have also mentioned, like those movies &#x22;in spite&#x22; of the
&#x22;boring&#x22; parts. Now, we&#x27;re talking about kids, from 6 to 11 years old,
so don&#x27;t be to harsh on their concept of &#x22;boring parts&#x22;. I remember how
I loved &#x22;Flash Gordon&#x22; in the 80&#x27;s, and &#x22;Superman II&#x22;. &#x22;Tron&#x22; was the
best because, after some 30 minutes of &#x22;boring&#x22; &#x22;real-world&#x22;, the whole
movie was set in a fantasy world, just like &#x22;The Dark Crystal&#x22; or &#x22;The
Beastmaster&#x22;. That&#x27;s what &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; brings now: a sense of
FANTASY without sacrificing it for the sake of making it more gritty,
or realistic. Yes, of course it has real-world scenes, but the movie
doesn&#x27;t linger in them in an effort to make you feel that this is real;
it just so happens that the characters live in this world, but the
important parts are when Green Lantern appears or when his world with
all the &#x22;funny looking&#x22; aliens make an appearance. That&#x27;s what other
movies don&#x27;t dare to do so they can appeal to older audiences. The sad
thing is that they forget about the young ones (or the young at heart
ones), and this movie proves that a movie with more fantastic elements
than logic can stand still make a great movie for old and young. I&#x27;m
not saying that Green Lantern is a &#x22;kids movie&#x22;; what I&#x27;m saying is
that Green Lantern is a superhero action movie that doesn&#x27;t shy away
from its own fantasy, and that&#x27;s what makes it great.
