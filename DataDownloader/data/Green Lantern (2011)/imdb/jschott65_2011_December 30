The only redeeming quality about this movie is Ryan Reynolds. Well,
that and Blake Liveley with dark hair (looks good).<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking by renting it, but I damn sure I want
my 1.99 back from Redbox. I honestly couldn&#x27;t wait for this movie to be
over. Obviously the basis for the storyline was already written, but
the stuff in between...horrible.<br /><br />I&#x27;m guessing, and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, that the only people that
genuinely like this movie are comic book fans. To be 100% honest, this
movie just plain sucks (sorry Ryan). The writing is terrible and I
didn&#x27;t believe or care about any of the characters.<br /><br />Again, I&#x27;m sorry to those who did like it, but this is my honest
review.
