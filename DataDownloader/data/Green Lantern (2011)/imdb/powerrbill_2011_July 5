This file premiered about 2 weeks ago and I couldn&#x27;t go for scheduling
reasons.<br /><br />Then, I put it off because the reviews were so bad. I chatted with
co-workers, some who were hopeful and others who were dissuaded because
of the bad reviews.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I discussed going to see it last week, but he&#x27;s not as
into superhero movies as I am and since the reviews were bad, we
decided to wait till it came out on video.<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE.<br /><br />Luckily, he went out of town on business and I went after work tonight.
I am so, so, so happy I did.<br /><br />DO NOT MISS THISON THE BIG SCREEN!!!!!!!<br /><br />Is Ryan Reynolds miscast? Yes, but it doesn&#x27;t matter: he does a fine
job. But it&#x27;s the villains that you need to see this movie for: Peter
Saarsgard&#x27;s performance is chilling, repulsive, scary and totally
amazing. And that CGI baddie named Paralax is just as scary....but he&#x27;s
massive and he does a serious number on whatever city he was attacking.<br /><br />The off-Earth scenes are great, the CGI/effects are very good. And the
characters like Kilowog and Sinestro are well-done. <br /><br />Bottom line: if you&#x27;re like me and you were letting the critics drive
your decision to see this film...DON&#x27;T LET THEM. It&#x27;s much better than
they&#x27;re giving it credit for. It&#x27;s better than Thor and it&#x27;s better
than First Class. <br /><br />Looking forward to Captain America!!!!
