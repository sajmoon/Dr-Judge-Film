2011_June 20 
First, I will point out that I am a big comic book fan, especially
Green Lantern and JLA. I really, really wanted to love this movie. My
own expectations may have shaded my viewing of the film.<br /><br />The movie was true to a lot of the things fans loved about GL in the
comic world. Ryan Reynolds was a little miscast, but he does a good job
with what he has. And Mark Strong is great as Sinestro. I would
actually go watch him play Sinestro in a stand alone title the way he
plays the character.<br /><br />The scenes with the GL Corps were great. There was better chemistry
with the Corps (CGI characters exclusively) and Hal Jordan than the
actual human actors.<br /><br />The GL movie had the same problem a lot of comics have - they hold back
the action too long and then the final conflict cannot possibly live up
to all of the build up. I cannot even say the build up to the final
battle was worth watching. Nor the final battle.<br /><br />I really hope they make GL 2, although I fear that the first movie may
do enough damage to prevent the creation of any franchise. The
potential plot points look good, but it will be hard to get mainstream
audiences back after the tragedy that is the first movie.<br /><br />Finally, and saddest of all, I most likely will not bring my 8-year old
nephew to this movie because the lack of action is so severe. He loves
comics and can be patient to wait for a great final battle, but even
that is not here.<br /><br />My best advice - go out and buy some GL comics, even some Justice
League of America, and read those for an hour and a half.
