Green Lantern, at first I didn&#x27;t know it was a movie based on a comic
book. Maybe that was the reason why it took some time to get in to this
movie.<br /><br />The story unravels quite fast, which at the same time enables you to
predict what&#x27;s going to happen, even without knowing the real story.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit strange to me, you are taken to world and are
introduced to well over 3000 other lanterns. But instead of working
together, he has to do everything alone. After having watched it all
the way I can only say that it&#x27;s a good story, but when made into a
movie they didn&#x27;t got everything out of the plot. <br /><br />The story offers so much options which they didn&#x27;t use. For me it was
just all going too fast, and you get the feeling that one scene isn&#x27;t
yet ended while the other already starts. It just doesn&#x27;t give you that
exciting feeling that keeps you on the tip of your seat. Very
unfortunate, maybe the second movie has more to offer?
