I wasn&#x27;t expecting much going in with all the negative reviews and what
not but man don&#x27;t listen to those critics. This film is amazing. I
believe most of &#x22;critics&#x22; must have been watching a different movie.
This film is pure entertainment and the special effects are amazing,
especially on OA. Personally, I was delighted to see some of the corps
members rendered with such detail. As a fan of Green Lantern and the
Corps I was very happy with this adaptation. It&#x27;s not perfect and has
the standard super hero origin story going on but this doesn&#x27;t hold it
back in my opinion. It&#x27;s like a mix of Superman(1978), Star Wars and
Indianna Jones; not as good as these movies but you get the pitch. If
you&#x27;re a fan or someone who enjoys films with adventure, humour and
action then this is for you. For the Corps!
