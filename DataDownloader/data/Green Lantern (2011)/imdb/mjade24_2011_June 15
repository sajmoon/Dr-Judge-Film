I wish I could say that I loved it and that it makes me want to know
more about Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern comics, but it just
doesn&#x27;t.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there just seemed to be too many missteps in the movie,
including the pace, the sound in the theater, and the oh-so-mellow
acting.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure I can blame the actors, but I know the screenplay didn&#x27;t
help. Unfortunately, the star power couldn&#x27;t do much with it. Ryan
Reynolds didn&#x27;t have his usual comedic flare that was used comfortably
for his Deadpool character in X-Men: Wolverine. Blake Lively didn&#x27;t
seem lively at all, and actually was quite bland. Peter Sarsgaard as
Hector Hammond just didn&#x27;t have much to work with as far as character
development. And some of the other, few other Green Lantern corps
members weren&#x27;t shown enough to generate much interest to their
characters.<br /><br />The theater I saw it in didn&#x27;t help much as the sound was surprisingly
lower than what I&#x27;m used to hearing. You literally couldn&#x27;t eat your
nachos if you wanted to hear what the characters were saying.<br /><br />Overall, it was lacking in too many areas and it was &#x22;just okay&#x22; for
me. Least favorite movie I&#x27;ve seen in the theater this year so far.
