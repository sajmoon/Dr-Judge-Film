This movie is a victim of bad timing rather than bad filmaking, to
start off the film as a whole is a good film yes it&#x27;s no masterpiece
but as comic book movie it&#x27;s good. The only issue is that we are now
spoiled by so many great comic book movie as a genre it&#x27;s so strong now
and most of the characters are so more well known and easy to identify
with. The movie as a whole is solid the casting is good and the story
is acceptable but the fact the green lantern is not known by a majority
of people leads to a lot of building of the initial story and
beginnings of the green lantern, this makes the movie a bit slow paced
and tedious at points. The main problem with this film is the complete
overuse of cgi and the cgi is not bad in the film but it leaves the
film lacking charm almost and this is a issue with so many films today.
If your looking for something to watch and enjoy this is a good choice
but don&#x27;t expect fireworks but hopefully they get at a chance at a
sequel because they built the character and story they could really do
something with the green lantern if given the chance.
