Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the newest superhero to make it to the big
screen is probably in the top 5 most important DC super-heroes (others
being Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and arguably the Flash).
Unfortunately, it&#x27;s far from being in the top 5 of the best
super-heroes movies. It&#x27;s competent, fairly entertaining but not
particularly great or engrossing. It&#x27;s a mix of earth-born adventure
with a bit of sci-fi thrown in on another planet and in space (which is
the more original part along with the fact, he&#x27;s not the only Green
Lantern).<br /><br />From the previews, I thought it was trying to be a bit like Iron Man
with the cocky womanizer protagonist. Not so much really. Ryan Reynolds
does an OK job. He looks the part and for the first time we see a
costume that really shows up the muscles like in the comics. However,
like others, I had troubles with the mask and specifically the
&#x22;lightning&#x22; coursing through (often yellow which is a no-no for history
reasons). Enough with those minor considerations and let&#x27;s move on to
the rest.<br /><br />The earth part is obviously set to &#x22;ground&#x22; our future hero. I
understand why that was done, but most of it wasn&#x27;t particularly
memorable. The dogfighting scene was exciting. I admit the fan boy in
me getting a little shiver when Hal started reciting his famous oath,
but it was undermined by alternating with another scene (not the only
part where that was done awkwardly). The scenes with his former
paramour (Carol Ferris) were kinda flat. I don&#x27;t know if it was from
lack of chemistry or just bland writing. The actress playing Ferris,
Blake Lively from Gossip Girl, really wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected. Far
more interesting was Dr. Hector Hammond an unfortunate-looking genius
with potential mental powers. I liked his portrayal, and I found the
part just before his exit (with Hal&#x27;s gift) very clever.<br /><br />I found the alien world (Oa) and the alien part far more interesting as
this is something unusual in superhero movie territory. The special
effects there were very well done but weirdly, I didn&#x27;t feel a sense of
awe (I must be growing blas&#xE9;). Unfortunately, very few aliens (not
counting the Guardians who mostly spout exposition) actually say or do
anything interesting (even in the background). I didn&#x27;t think &#x22;computer
graphics&#x22; for them as I watched which is an exploit in itself. Some of
my favorite moments involved those aliens. Sinestro could have looked
really corny but he looked fine and pretty faithful to the comics. I
think it also helped that he was acted very well without going
over-the-top.<br /><br />Green Lantern can create basically anything he can will into being as a
physical (green) construct. On one hand, it means you can be quite
imaginative in the use of his powers. On the other hand, it runs the
risk of being ridiculous. The problem here is that I was constantly
second-guessing the hero&#x27;s choices. They seemed sometimes unnecessarily
convoluted (ex.: the track) or illogical (ex.: the planes). It makes
for nice visual effects but also makes things less visceral.<br /><br />From the trailer, you would expect funnier fare (like Iron Man), but
things too often fell flat. I don&#x27;t remember hearing much laughter from
the theatre crowd if at all, and I wasn&#x27;t really amused myself with a
couple exceptions. There was one amusing part where Hal Jordan wants to
show his powers to his friend that played on our expectations because
of the trailer. That was clever, unexpected while also giving a needed
explanation.<br /><br />All in all, I liked Green Lantern although I preferred the other
superhero movies this summer (excluding Captain America which I haven&#x27;t
seen yet). I wouldn&#x27;t pay full ticket price for it (especially not 3d
which was not really not worth it), but a rental later on would be
recommended especially if you tend to like superhero fare. I think
critics and the public would not have been so severe if there hadn&#x27;t
been so many superhero movies this season and if Green Lantern hadn&#x27;t
cost so much.<br /><br />Rating: 6 out of 10 (Good)
