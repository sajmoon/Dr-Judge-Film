But its not as bad as people make it out to be. It&#x27;s 15x better than
Thor...that has GOT to count as something.<br /><br />Watched Green Lantern...On a scale of best to worst represented by
Titanic to Kazaam...Its about Star Trek (2009)...Great effects (and hot
actors/actresses), but a solid story and proper background into the
series is lacking.... <br /><br />1. Hal isn&#x27;t the first Human to be a GL, that&#x27;s Alan Scott. 2. Along
with the first, most people don&#x27;t understand that Alan was the first,
Hal was the strongest (Will wise) and John was the blackest (and better
fighting wise.) 3. CALM DOWN, DC movies only top with Batman, Marvel is
better &#x27;cuz its got the Disney money now. 4. Thor was god awful...So
this is better in comparison. Win/Win, right?<br /><br />I give it 3.9/5 shirtless Ryan Reynolds...Mmmm,Love you, Ryan...
