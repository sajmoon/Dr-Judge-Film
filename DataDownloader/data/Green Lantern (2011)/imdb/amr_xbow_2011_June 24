Basically, Green Lantern is a really good superhero movie, it doesn&#x27;t
have the best story in the world, or a complicated unfolding plot, it&#x27;s
pretty much straight forward superhero film.<br /><br />Story: the story was good it was not too long as long as it should be,
and it was not filled with Characters like other superhero movies that
have a lot of characters and a lot of things going on in the same time.<br /><br />Character design: the characters were designed in a good way, some of
the other &#x22;lanterns&#x22; were kinda weird but I&#x27;m not to Judge cuz I wasn&#x27;t
really familiar with his comics.<br /><br />Acting: this movie made me a fan of Blake Lively I wasn&#x27;t fond of her
acting before but I did like her acting, not that Gossip girl stuff!,
Ryan Reynolds is a good actor and did a good job<br /><br />3D: OK!.<br /><br />All in all, it&#x27;s a good movie, really, some people keep hating on it, I
gave it a 6, it could have been way better with more work in it, but
it&#x27;s a good movie go see it if you&#x27;re out for some fun and good time,
specially if you&#x27;re a fan of green lantern or Action/Sci-Fi light
movies.
