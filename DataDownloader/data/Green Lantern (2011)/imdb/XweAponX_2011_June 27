I have the Green Lantern Comics (Numbers 49-51 circa 1993) where Hal
Jordan goes crazy and smashes the main power battery on OA, and gives
up his GL status to a new Green Lantern. But Hal Jordan has always been
Green Lantern to me, even with other people putting the ring on over
the years.<br /><br />This film accounts the story of how Hal Jordan was chosen by the ring,
as the dying Abin Sur sends out the ring to find a successor. Not to
get into too much of a spoiler here, so I won&#x27;t say how that happens in
the film, which is slightly different than the original &#x22;Origin or
Green Lantern&#x22; stories I have read when I was a kid, suffice it to say,
the people who made this film had 5 decades of Green Lantern stories to
get into a 2 hour film. And they did it good.<br /><br />I saw this in 3D and it was adequate 3D, the look of Green Lantern was
sort of a blend of all the different changes in costume he had over the
years. Ryan Reynolds was a very good Hal Jordan, and Blake Lively a
very very good Carol Ferris. A lot of the characters from the comics
are in this, there is a &#x22;Pieface&#x22; but he is not Asian, there is an
appearance by Sinestro who in this film is the head of the Green
Lantern Corps, which includes veteran Green Lantern Tomar-Re voiced by
Geoffery Rush, and Micheal Clark Duncan voicing Kilowog, all much loved
GL characters, and the appearance of the Green Lantern Corps was a very
good idea.<br /><br />The Guardians of OA looked much like they looked in the comics, they
named none of the Guardian Actors save Warren Burton and Salome Jens
(who was the main Shape-Shifter in Star Trek: Deep Space 9), the rest
of them are, well they are just Guardians. the evil entity Parallax was
voiced by one of my favourite actors, Clancy Brown.<br /><br />As far as Production, some great names popped out during the credits:
James Newton Howard did a very good score, on par with his King Kong
score, and the whole production was designed by another who worked on
King Kong: Oscar winner Grant Major who had that same job in Lord of
the Rings trilogy - And the costumes were done by another Lord of the
Rings veteran, Ngila Dickson, another Oscar winner.<br /><br />As far as the director, I had never heard of Martin Campbell except for
Casino Royale and Vertical Limit, but one name did pop out: Stuart
Baird, a veteran Editor, who has edited some great films all the way
back to the Donner version of Superman II, Gorillas in the Mist, and of
course he directed Star Trek: Nemesis which I rather liked.<br /><br />Green Lantern being one of my favourite comic books when I was a kid, I
was very gratified to see this film- They really did not take very many
liberties with the stories which they cultivated to make this film, so
I give it a 10 - Mostly because I can care less what anyone&#x27;s lame
gripes about this film are, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was done very
well.
