I actually found the idea of a remake of &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; interesting.
There is something unlimited about a superhero with a ring that can
create any weapon, only restricted by his own imagination... But...
This movie stinks like burning leather. It should never have gotten a
score this high, which makes me wonder if people have gone insane, have
confused the movie with &#x22;green hornet&#x22;, or if they are on the paylist
of the production company. The movie features a lame hero, and a
completely abstract and amorph villain. The hero-character has no other
personality than Ryan Reynold&#x27;s, which is always the same. Accepting
him as the hero was difficult, since every line he had was ridiculous.
His training by the best galactic warriors seemed fake and was over in
2 minutes. Everything, even the universe-construction, is quite awful.
The romance and &#x22;big brother&#x22;-theme is poorly done and unbelievably
lame. OH! One last thing: the best action in the film is sub-standard
and inferior to other films of the same type. Do not waste your time!
