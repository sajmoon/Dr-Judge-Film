CRAP! I&#x27;ve never read any of the comics. And I have no knowledge on the
superhero. And I STILL think it&#x27;s crap.<br /><br />CRAP! Let me start off with Reynolds&#x27;s tan, HE&#x27;S FREAKING ORANGE! OK
back to the movie... first of all, for an action movie... there wasn&#x27;t
much action, and the action that is in it (the oh so little action)
sucked. Secondly, the script... dear lord... no feeling, no EMOTION,
just... fear this, fear that. My one thought the entire movie &#x22;When
will it end?!&#x22;. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the story. And last but
not least, the acting. Oh yes the wonderfully CRAPPY acting. Orange
Reynolds, I&#x27;m sorry but... you blew this one. Him and... everybody
else.<br /><br />1/10 for wasting an hour and 40 minutes of my life. I do not recommend
watching this movie because this movie, like Reynolds&#x27;s tan, failed.
CRAP!
