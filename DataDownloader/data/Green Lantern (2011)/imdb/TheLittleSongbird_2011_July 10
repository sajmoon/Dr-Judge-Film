I like superhero movies as much as the next person, having grown up on
the likes of Superman and Batman. Green Lantern is not the worst
superhero movie, but far from the best either. For me it was just a
mildly average and somewhat bland movie, that didn&#x27;t live up to the
potential it had.<br /><br />Getting the good things out of the way, I did like the cinematography,
settings and costumes very much, and while they weren&#x27;t among the best
or most detailed I&#x27;ve seen the effects were better than average apart
from Parralex. The score/soundtrack by James Newton Howard compliments
the film very nicely, Martin Campbell&#x27;s direction is assured and there
are classy turns from Mark Strong, Tim Robbins and Peter Sarsgaard.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds didn&#x27;t quite work for me. Now don&#x27;t
get me wrong, I initially found him an ideal choice in the title role.
The problem is not that Reynolds is bad, actually he is quite spirited
in the role, it&#x27;s just that the character himself like a lot of the
characters in the movie is irritatingly bland. Blake Lively is cute and
lovely, but her performance goes little beyond that. The story starts
off well with an intriguing idea, being an origin story and all, but is
bogged down by too many characters, tedious pacing and too thin a story
for such a running time consequently some scenes seemed as though they
were going on longer than they should&#x27;ve done. However though, these
problems are pretty trivial compared to the script, which to put it
kindly was an awkward, clich&#xE9;-driven mess.<br /><br />Overall, neither good or bad, but very average and bland. 5/10 Bethany
