Green Lantern is quite like no other comic book film I have seen to
date. This is perhaps the good and the bad of that notion. Beckoned
finally by the powers that be, a special human is selected by a large
corp, because they believe he holds leverage over all the others to
bring something special to all man kind. If you think I&#x27;m referring to
the general plot line, I was more steering this towards how Ryan
Reynolds garnered the job. Reynolds simply isn&#x27;t a hero. Not in a
traditional sense, and while maybe Hal Jordan isn&#x27;t the traditional
hero, Reynolds simply doesn&#x27;t have the gravitas to deliver. He can win
me over with a few small scenes, but Hal Jordan is destined to carry
the weight of the the large responsibility. I think Dennis Quaid. Now
this isn&#x27;t to suggest that the part should have gone to Quaid (but
hell, how sweet would that film be?) but we have to believe that there
is a possibility that a &#x22;Quaid&#x22; lives dormant for the time being in
this Hal Jordan body. What we get is more akin to Randy Quaid. Reynolds
is the interchangeable actor. You can simply replace him with countless
body types and get the same film. Bradley Cooper or Paul Walker come to
mind. There are some scenes that stirred emotion in me and I started to
see the potential in what this film had, but all this led to more
depression because I was more aware of what Martin Campbell missed. The
more he showcased these small moments the more frustrating it got when
he didn&#x27;t stay with it. This was DC&#x27;s first attempt at a franchise
outside of the two powerhouses of the last 30 years, and it comes at us
like Daredevil or Fantastic Four did for Marvel. Ouch. The dialogue is
messy and stilted. There isn&#x27;t anything memorable here and given the
writing credits, you&#x27;d think Berlanti would at least push for some of
his signature human emotionfest he was known for to make an appearance.
The film clunks forward for the first 45 minutes and not until Randy
Qua-er, Ryan Quai- ... Reynolds is literally out of this world does the
story lift us and the possibility up. Campbell wasn&#x27;t capable here, the
3-D is useless like always and at the end of the day, the tone of story
simply isn&#x27;t sweeping. Not even a proper theme. Lesson #345 of the
superhero genre, you need a theme. Period. Fear is what the film
focused on. I&#x27;m afraid it failed.
