I just couldn&#x27;t take this movie seriously, and that&#x27;s pretty bad when
2/3 of it is supposed to be &#x22;deep&#x22; personal drama. Everything from the
villains to the jokes and costumes made it impossible to take
seriously. I felt like the creators were trying to make something along
the lines of Batman Begins, showing the struggles that result in
creating the superhero, however it really just didn&#x27;t work at all. It
seemed a lot more like the Batman movies that came before Batman
Begins. Just ridiculous and cheesy. <br /><br />I give it a generous 5, though it really deserves a 2 for ruining a
great opportunity.
