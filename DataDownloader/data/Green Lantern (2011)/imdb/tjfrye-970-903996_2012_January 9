When talking about this film adaptation of the popular DC comic, one
can not just bash it because of the obvious, because what makes a movie
bad isn&#x27;t always just the obviously bad traits. Yes Ryan Reynolds is
just eye candy to attract female viewers, and yes Blake Lively gives
probably one of the worst female lead performances I have seen in a
summer blockbuster (I just found her bland, but it&#x27;s no huge issue),
and yes the villain is just an essence of pure evil that has no
development whatsoever.<br /><br />With Green Lantern you have to look beyond all of the obvious things
that would make you hate a movie, you have to compromise with it and
take it for what it is. Otherwise it&#x27;ll be a pitiful experience when
really it could be something to be enjoyed. In this review I will
refuse to name off the bad because it&#x27;s all already obvious just by
seeing the trailer or the cast. I&#x27;d rather promote some optimism and
support it and show people what really this movie has to offer. (and
also my own personal changes that I would have done if I were Martin
Campbell and Greg Berlanti) 1. ---Villains---When I previously bashed
the villain in the beginning of this review, I was talking about
Parallax the giant entity of evil. Aside that point I think the real
villain this movie should have stuck with was Peter Sarsgaard&#x27;s role as
Hector Hammond. I mean, MY GOD, I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen such an
interesting and tragic story for such a villain. He starts out as just
an everyday man, but when he gets infected by Parallax he goes through
his own personal story arc. They make him seem more like a victim of
this disease, and society. I love how they play off the idea how he&#x27;s
tortured by the thoughts of others that he can hear. That&#x27;s a great
villain to me, not Parallax (Who&#x27;s name always makes me giggle because
I just think of a giant space laxative). I think Parallax could have
been interesting, but he really just needed more character development,
I personally would have put him in the second movie, and put Sinestro&#x27;s
story into a third movie. That would make it a great way to round off a
trilogy, have three story arcs that move in a grand sweeping manner,
rather than having a shabby start, and a sequel that&#x27;s hopefully going
to better.<br /><br />2. ---Action---This is a bright and flashy DC comic book adaptation,
you have to expect seeing some flashy action scenes with interesting
elaborate fights. What you get with this movie is most of that. It&#x27;s
bright flashy, but most of the action is almost cartoonish because of
the whole idea of the ring holding the power, but honestly it works.
The rings work off of the imaginations and wills of those who use them.
So it only makes sense that a childish and immature person like Hal
Jordan, would construct things like jets, and hammers, and swords, and
guns. It&#x27;s just what he thinks of since he&#x27;s only human. There&#x27;s not
much I would change with the action, other than I would have made it
darker. Yes people burn and die and bleed, but when Hal Jordan fights
he doesn&#x27;t really never physically seemed harmed, he stays clean and
bruise free. I think it would have been more interesting if you could
just see the pain he was experiencing when he was getting beaten down
by Hector...or heck even Kilawog for that matter.<br /><br />3. ---Drama---This movie was completely advertised as a summer action
blockbuster style of movie. Yes it has its fair share of action, but
what really drives it is it&#x27;s characters (despite how bland they might
be) and their relationships and how they grow to understand themselves
and each other. By the end Hal does learn how to pull through desperate
times, he gets the girl (sorta), and stays with being a lantern. He
didn&#x27;t quite in the face of danger, that was what he was supposed to be
written as and that&#x27;s how he was conveyed, which is very good. Hector
driven mad eventually gives up and accepts his fate as being this freak
of society and he wants to wreak revenge. He gets his revenge in many
ways, but he gets what is coming to him like any other revenge based
villain. No changes here, just better casting choices for the female
lead is really all I can point out. Other than that everything about
Hector Hammond was already said.<br /><br />If you pay attention to all of these little things and try to
understand the characters on a personal level, then it&#x27;s not hard
fining at least some enjoyment in this movie. I still can only give it
a six, because yes it is a shabby start to the film career of the Green
Lantern, but being a fan of the comic books since childhood I
personally give this a 7.5 because of nostalgia. Thank you for reading,
and remember to always look for what is truly great in a movie, because
that is what cinema is about, seeing what you love and accepting it for
what it is. -FryeGuy
