Come on people, you saw the trailer, you knew how cheesy it was going
to be. Just watch the trailer and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. I mean the
villain is a doctor with an over-sized forehead! I&#x27;ve never seen that
before! &#x22;You have the ability to overcome fear&#x22;... wow! What brilliant
writing! Blake lively is eye candy but seriously she&#x27;s such a dead
actress. I came into the theatre knowing that this movie might suck and
in fact I was fairly satisfied. It was cheesy, and I&#x27;ll keep saying
that and I think it was meant to be that way. But I can see where the
negativity may be coming from. It doesn&#x27;t choose to balance. At one end
you have Mark Strong as a really good Sinestro and the other end you
have... all the other stuff. It&#x27;s still watchable, there won&#x27;t be any
point in time where you feel like leaving.
