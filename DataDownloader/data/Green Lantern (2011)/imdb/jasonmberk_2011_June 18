This movie was very enjoyable. It provided a faithful adaptation of the
Hal Jordan Green Lantern comic book character and other characters from
the comics. The plot was appropriate for a Green Lantern story. The
visuals were stunning and there were plenty of scenes with little or no
effects or CGI. I particularly liked how Hal Jordan&#x27;s character was
portrayed and developed, as I felt it was unique for a superhero
character. Here we have a guy who is NOT Superman, i.e. gifted with an
enormous array of superpowers, nor do we have Batman, who is a trained
professional. In this film, we have a superhero who&#x27;s greatest strength
by far is himself, especially his will. That is what drives the
character through challenges and to victory by the end of the film, not
superpowers alone, not fancy gadgets, not elaborate fighting skills,
just who he is and believing in himself and in winning. I like it! Not
an original concept perhaps, but as far as mythology goes, this movie
tells a great tale and gives us another great hero&#x27;s journey, one that
occurs as changes from within, not just changes physically. Go see this
film if you like superheros or if you want to be inspired to have
courage and believe in yourself a little more. Don&#x27;t listen to the
critics. This is not a one star movie. It does not suck. As I said, it
is not a classic film, but it is very good and worth seeing. My only
real issue is that the dramatic elements were a bit too long, although
a condensed version of the drama would still be entirely necessary.
Also, a superhero who&#x27;s greatest power is believing in himself and in
success takes some getting used to compared to a dude who just has
amazing powers or fights like Batman. Anyways, enjoy!
