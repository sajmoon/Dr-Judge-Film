It&#x27;s rare that a movie surpasses my expectations, but this one did. As
perhaps one of the less-known, less-popular superheroes, Green
Lantern&#x27;s origins added a lot to the story, and the noble theme to his
mission endears the audience, and perhaps strikes a chord when the
battle between &#x22;fear&#x22; and &#x22;will&#x22; is articulated throughout the movie.
Blake Lively, of &#x22;Traveling Pants&#x22; fame does an outstanding job of
being the beauty and brains, while still being the vulnerable maiden in
distress. The personal struggles of the novice superhero strike a chord
with most every viewer, and keep you rooting for him until the end. The
graphics are a bit cartoonish at times, but this is a superhero action
movie, so anything goes. The almost unlimited powers possessed by the
Green Lantern keep you guessing during the intense conflicts with the
bad guys, both of which are reaaal bad. Very enjoyable, and my 23 yr
old son who watched it with me was very impressed also - he&#x27;s usually
very particular about the movies he watches. Fun and entertaining.
