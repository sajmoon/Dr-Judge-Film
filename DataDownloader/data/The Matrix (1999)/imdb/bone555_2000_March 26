I am a movie fanatic and I would definitely say that this is my favorite
movie.  Great story, o.k. acting, amazing,  literally &quot;award-winning&quot;
special effects, great action, and great actors.  The only reason I gave it
a 9 instead of a 10 is because the story line can be a little hard to
understand and the acting is not the best.  But, besides that, definitely
rent this one.  It is a winner.
