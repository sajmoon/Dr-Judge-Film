1999_June 28 

This movie was way overrated. Intellectually stimulating? I don't think
so.
A decent movie, better than the average summer movie (e.g. Deep Impact --
GOD that was terrible), but nothing profound like it's made out to be.<br /><br />The major premise -- people as fuel for the machines -- makes no sense. No
sunlight means no plantlife, no plantlife means no animal life. Period.
The
machines are working on a net loss system that can't be sustained. Period.
The screenwriters must have flunked biology 101.<br /><br />And there were other inconsistencies that made no sense, like the prophet.
If there ends up being an explanation for everything else, there should be
an explanation for why she knew the future.<br /><br />The Matrix just left me confused -- not because I didn't understand what
was
happening or why, but because I didn't see the point, didn't see what
people
thought was so great about it, didn't think it was visually impressive,
etc.
As I say, booooring...
