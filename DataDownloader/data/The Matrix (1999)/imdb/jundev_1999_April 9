1999_April 9 

This will be the first of many cyberfictions that will eventually drown
Hollywood before the end of 20th millennium.  The movie is full of awesome
tai-chi actions though that I love.   Even if the premise of the ultimate
demise of a controlling system that defines and bounded everyday life during
the 22nd millennium is somewhat goofy.<br /><br />The question is once the Matrix, the omnipotent, and omnipresent system was
destroyed, what will guide the humanity?  Fear?  Greed? (Which is the
guiding principle of the 21st millennium).  If there boundless and infinite
possibility upon the destruction of logical sequence, will metaphysic
becomes the faith?  I can just jump into the conclusion.  What is evil and
what is good?<br /><br />Scientists are debating the projection that Sun will not be the major energy
source today, and the emergence of hot spots in the oceans redefine the
thinking of the only source of life.  But this movie is based on the premise
that the ultimate energy source will be the human itself as it generates
energy and being harvested in energy farm.  This premise is illogical, even
if we multiply the human during the time of the movie (say 2199, say
population at 20B) then each human being is to produce at least a thousand
BTU equivalents to replace the Sun.   We need the episode2,  e=Mx2 to give
us the replacement for formula e=mc2 to explain the unexplainable of Mx1,
let say Neo is now equal God and he is  The second coming prophesied by
lot of pseudo-religions.  What will be the episode 2 based its premise?  Neo
the God with Trinity will bear offspring Quadrant to define human existence
in the 23rd millennium?  Is that it? The premise and promise  of infinite
possibility, like the removal of time and space is intriguing and debatable
and will be a debacle.<br /><br />Mx1 is a sophistry, let the Mx2 explained the logic.<br /><br />
