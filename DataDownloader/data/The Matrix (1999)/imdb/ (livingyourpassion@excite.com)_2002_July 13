This is one of my personal favorite action films. It sets a new standard on
sci-fi films, much like Star Wars did back in the late 70's. The plot is
intriguing and the action is probably some of the best cinema has ever seen.
When the film was in theaters, I paid to see it 3 times. I just felt
everything about this film was right. The plot, the action, the cast, score,
effects, everything played together perfectly. Obviously, the originality on
what the matrix is makes the movie extremely unique and special. People seem
to like bashing Keanu Reeves as dopey, but I feel he did an excellent job as
Neo and seemed to be a perfect fit. Who knew Michael Keaton would be the
best pick as Batman back in 89? What did Keaton do before Batman, Mr. Mom? I
really enjoyed this film and it is one of my favorite in my DVD collection.
Even if you are not into sci-fi films or action films, this film is worth
checking out. If you liked this film, I suggest you rent Dark City, another
dark sci-fi gem. <br /><br />Grade: A
