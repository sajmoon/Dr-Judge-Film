in a day &amp; age bombarded with action flicks with stunning visuals but
cheesy plots. matrix may presents itself as just another to the
ignorant or those who does not comprehend the matrix itself, but it
really comes across as a philosophical masterpiece. if treated as a
popcorn flick, most will remember the matrix as another summer
blockbuster with mindblowing special effects for its time, however if
engaged at a deeper level, the matrix becomes a work of philosophy,
questioning humanity &amp; our very own existence itself, whats real or
surreal, whats the meaning of real, how does one even define real? one
will become so deeply engaged with the idea behind the matrix that itll
push your mind to think beyond the square we live in. in the end, the
matrix goes beyond entertainment, the matrix will make you more
open-minded &amp; perceptive to the world we live in.
