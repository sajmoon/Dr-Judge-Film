1999_September 23 

This film had the look and effects and the action. . .but lacked in story
and humanity. It failed to follow-thorough in execution to become the
satisfying science fiction tale it intended. The result was a comic book
sketch of a film, rather than a fully realized one.  'Dark City' was a
superior film in this genre that did accomplish a similar
goal.
