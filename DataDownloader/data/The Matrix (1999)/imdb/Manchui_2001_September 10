Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like &quot;The Matrix is the
greatest film EVER MADE!&quot;<br /><br />That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and
effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and
NO WAY was the storyline great.<br /><br />Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would
leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was &quot;What
is
the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself.&quot; Come on, the only plot twist
was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable,
there's things like that in every frigging action movie.<br /><br />The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly
special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit,
with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you
would be left with is your average action movie.<br /><br />I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest.
Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the
most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento
or the Usual Suspects any day.<br /><br />7/10
