1999_April 20 

Like many others, I thought the action was a lot of fun, with great
visuals
and wonderful John Woo-style &quot;ballet of bullets&quot; sequences.  I thought the
various chase scenes and showdowns were well integrated with the plot, and
flowed seamlessly, with nothing I noticed in the way of obvious
plot-continuity errors.<br /><br />However, for anyone out there thinking this movie is really DEEP,
philosophically speaking, and ORIGINAL, in terms of plot scenario, must
not
have progressed passed the &quot;midnight bong sessions&quot; stage of their
education.  Come on people, characters asking &quot;have you ever felt like you
don't know the difference between what is real and what is a dream?&quot;  is
very run-of-the-mill in the sci-fantasy genre, as is much of the rest of
the
movie.<br /><br />Also, as for cinematic originality, this stuff has nothing on, say, Terry
Gilliam, Ridley Scott, or any of a number of other people.  They seem to
have borrowed and innovated all over the place, in terms of visuals, plot
devices, action sequences, and special effects.<br /><br />BUT HEY, they did a DAMN GOOD JOB OF THAT, so I say, why
not?
So don't get me wrong--I think this movie is great fun and sufficiently
original that it deserves its popularity, but think it's just plain wrong
to
declare this the &quot;Best Movie Ever&quot;.
