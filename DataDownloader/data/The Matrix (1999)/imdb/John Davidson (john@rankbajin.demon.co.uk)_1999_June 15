1999_June 15 

With special effects to rival Terminator 2 (better but with the same
impact)
and a plot that is intelligent, original and well told, 'The Matrix' could
well be  the best Science Fiction movie of the year.(I haven't seen Star
Wars Episode 1 yet...).<br /><br />The basic story is based on the concept of a world where everyone
unwittingly shares a common 'virtual' reality and the attempts of a band
of
outsiders to disrupt/challenge the existing regime.
The theme is far from new, obviously, going back to Brave New World, 1984
and a host of outsider 'heroes' struggling against a dystopian
future.<br /><br />There are also some interesting sub-texts :-
The ritualistic rite of passage to illumination,
the nature of prophecy and perhaps the most searching question
&quot;Is it better to live 'free' and in squalor or to experience a better
seeming fantasy life ?&quot;<br /><br />Unlike many effects driven science fiction movies, the acting, plot and
dialogue are all top notch and I heartily recommend
going to see this film.
