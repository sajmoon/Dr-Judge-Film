1999_July 1 

I&acute;ve got to see the movie first on videocd a week ago andI
just fell in love with it.
Outstanding Plot, outstanding fighting scenes, outstanding
Keanu, outstanding clothings, outstanding dialogues, outstanding,
outstanding, outstanding ...........
You can&acute;t compare this movie to 2001 or Blade Runner,
they simply aren&acute;t on such a &quot;low-level&quot;, but it definitely
beats
any action-movie in that class. Can&acute;t wait for the next
two parts!!!!
