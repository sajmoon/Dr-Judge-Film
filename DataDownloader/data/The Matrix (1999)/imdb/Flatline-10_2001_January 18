...that I should not have rated The Matrix 10 out of 10 at the
first time. I
should have discovered that it stole too much from other genres. (Like
&quot;The
Ghost In The Shell&quot; which is an Anime movie (really great!) from 1995!!
And
it contains the &quot;greenish&quot; program code all over the movie.)<br /><br />Or i should have discovered that these very cool (i mean it!) special
effects
WERE actually stolen too, because those were animated in those manga (or
call it Anime) films before. All they had to do is to make it real, not
pencil drawn.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed, because Matrix was my favorite movie (and still
is)
but I give it an 8 out of 10 now, after seeing &quot;The Ghost In The Shell&quot;...
Man, the flying scene, where the agent lands on the rooftop, and stands
up,
that's EXACTLY what Major Kusanagi did in &quot;The Ghost In The
Shell&quot;.<br /><br />4 years before The Matrix... And I think.. That's a shame.
:-)<br /><br />Matrix rocks. It's still very good. I'm just asking myself: Why can't a
REALLY good looking movie contain original ideas?!<br /><br />There are 10 out of 10 films out there... Try &quot;The Cell&quot; or &quot;The
Cube&quot;.<br /><br />Those are original.<br /><br />Thanks for listening!<br /><br />
