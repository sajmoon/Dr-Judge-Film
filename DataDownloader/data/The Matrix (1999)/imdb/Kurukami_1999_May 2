Without a doubt, The Matrix is one of the finest science fiction films
I've
EVER seen -- and that hallowed category is sparsely populated, with peers
like &quot;Bladerunner&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;.  These days, it seems as though the vast
majority of sci-fi is predictable, mediocre, and trashy.<br /><br />The Matrix is anything but.  It seeks out the basis of everything we
believe
to be real and forces us to question reality.  It's very existentialist,
after a fashion.  I, and a large number of my peers, left the theater in a
state of heightened awareness, thinking: &quot;What IS real?&quot;  That's the kind
of
lasting effect that this excellent film has on your state of mind.  The
overall plotline seems to be a take on Campbell's classic &quot;hero's
journey&quot;... but the film certainly doesn't suffer from being derivative of
it.<br /><br />But the story isn't the only winning point of the film.  Gripping combat
scenes, magnificently performed wire-work and stunts, some of the finest
and
most seamless special effects I've seen in ages....  All of these combine
with first-rate acting and a melange of contemporary music and
instrumental
scoring, to produce an epic, outstanding whole that will be remembered for
decades.  Personally, I'm avidly awaiting a sequel, if, as is rumored, the
Wachowski brothers plan this to be the first film in a trilogy.
