This film shows something that not many films attempt. What struck me the
most is that they dealt the pure enigma of life and fate as a whole.
Despite
the lack of story and the countless meaningless action, they replaced it
well with the meaning of the film. This movie showed something that I can
figure, not many people noticed. They completely flipped reality as a whole
upside down, but the directors knew that this would be a hard task. So they
incorporated truth behind the complexity. I know that I might be digging
too
deep within this film, but from watching interviews of the directors and
listening to what the actors were saying. I feel that they made this film
to
show, not just comic book action, but to pretty much show how abstract this
world can be, despite what we think about it. It was made to show how the
human mind is a such a fragile yet powerful thing. Despite our knowledge
and
our own thought of superiority in this universe, in the end, our ignorance
got the best of us. This film demonstrated that well, and despite having
Keanu Reeves as Neo, he was probably the only person that could have played
that part well. What struck me, was how they demonstrated the use of the
mind. Alot of people crave meaning and answers behind alot of the
metaphysical uses in the film, but the directors did a good job in just
saying that the mind is the answer behind all reality and answers. These
demonstrations that were being projected in the film, were their for a
reason, not just random pointless scenes. My favorite scene in the film is
when Neo watches the little bald-headed girl bend the spoon with her mind.
Neo than attempted this next, and she then told him something that was the
answer behind the entire film and the answers Neo had been looking for. She
told him that that it is not the spoon he should attempt to bend, but his
mind. After she said that, the meaning of the whole film unfolded for me.
The point I feel behind that saying, was that we should see through the
cracks of reality as we know it, and look to where it all is... our minds.<br /><br />That is why I feel this film ventured places that not many films have gone
and why I think it is a great film<br /><br />
