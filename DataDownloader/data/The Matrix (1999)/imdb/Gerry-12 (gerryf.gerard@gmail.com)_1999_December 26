The Matrix combines an incoherent script with intoxication with special
effects.  A large chunk of the film is a stretched out denouement in which
all the characters, goodies and baddies, are equally invulnerable.
Buildings are blown up, walls shattered and general mayhem occurs, but no
main character is injured beyond biting their lips, and no motivation for
any part of the action is even hinted at.  A Road Runner cartoon has been
reissued with some live actors, and possibly some robots.<br /><br />There is one laugh in the film, when Fishburne, after putting Reeves
through
substantial torture and fastening him down in what looks like a dentist's
chair says ''Just try to relax''.
