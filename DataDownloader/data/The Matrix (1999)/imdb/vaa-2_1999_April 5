Enjoyed this film enormously.  First chosen for Keanu Reeves, followed by an
interest in special-effects and computers, this movie was a visual treat.
The martial arts scenes were spectacular, the use of stop action to pan
technique was not overused.  The contrasts between the inner world of the
Matrix and the 'real' world were effective. <br /><br />While some of the scenarios were a little outrageous, enjoy with an open mind -
after all you aren't a sentient program and the rules don't apply to
you.
