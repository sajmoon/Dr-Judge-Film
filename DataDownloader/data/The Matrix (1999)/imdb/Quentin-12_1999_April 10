1999_April 10 

The first thing I had to say after this movie was completed was Wow.  For a
film that took five years to make it seems almost worth it when you view the
finished product.  A very intelligent sci-fi / action flick.  Morpheus
reminded me of an old high-school teacher I once had, the way he spoke in
metaphors.  From rumours I've heard it's to be the first part of an
electrifying trilogy.  I hope to see more from these two brothers in the
future.  It gave us hints of Star Wars and also the Bible - which is a
strange conjunction.  A good movie.
