1999_April 17 

Keanu Reeves hasn't had much success in the sci-fi genre in years past
(I'm
sure we all remember &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;?), but &quot;The Matrix&quot; is really an
excellent film.  It's worth seeing for the special effects alone, but the
premise is interesting if unbelievable and the plot is surprisingly
strong.
The must-see movie of 1999 so far.
