One of the best episodes of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATIOn featured an
ending where a mad scientist was locked into a holodeck, which gave him
the
illusion of reality but in fact was his prison.<br /><br />A similar story is at play here - computers have enslaved humans in
virtual prisons, and use their bodies for an energy source, but give the
humans a virtual reality to keep them from knowing the truth. But a small
band of pale, renegade humans have figured out the truth and are trying to
subvert the computer-master's plans.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers, Larry and Andy, have created this premise as
much
more than an excuse to stage some of the finest fightr scenes and effects
sequences ever made; the plot works very well on a number of levels.
First,
it's an intriguing sci-fi thriller with plenty of unexpected twists and
turns. Second, it's a dramatic, suspenseful mind-f**k with a
through-the-looking-glass plot. But most effectively, it's an allegory - a
religious metaphor - with one man (&quot;the One&quot;) called upon to harness his
gifts in the service of humankind.<br /><br />A very solid story backed up by wonderful action sequences and special
effects, with a great look to it and a sequel on the way.
