1999_June 9 

When I learned about &quot;The Matrix&quot; and first saw the trailer I was very
suspicious and didn't know what to expect of the movie.
I mean, I love Keanu Reeves but he screwed up more than one movie
(including
his other Cyberpunk-Thriller &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;). I also saw &quot;Assassins&quot;
and
&quot;Bound&quot; by the Wachowski Brothers (&quot;Bound&quot; is a strange movie - while
watching it I changed my mind few times - Do I like it or not?). In the
end
I wasn't sure if they could do this. But now I know...
&quot;The Matrix&quot; is definitely the best Cyberpunk-Movie so far and for me one
of
the best Sci-Fi &amp; Overall movies of all time.
For a reallive-movie it also comes closest to an japanese Manga comic as
possible. I really loves the Bullet-Time-Scenes.
So now I know what the Matrix is - but how can one destroy
it?
Let's hope for a sequel...
