Simply one of the best action films of all time. Only Keanu Reeves mars this
production. Good acting (besides Reeves), good dialog, good story, good
effects, good combat scenes. You must see the DVD or Collector's Edition,
which explains the bullet-time photography concept. Bullet-time is now a
household phrase and an idea which is mocked in many teen spoof
flicks.
