I love this movie, I think this is the best movie I've ever seen.
Characters including villains are super, prop are realistic (except the
enemy ship), SFX is great, and the clothes especially sunglasses!
During my short US trip I seen this 3 times in movie theater.  I'm sure
I'll
see several more times if it comes to Japan.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Japanese culture, including manga/anime
(Japanimation), you'll be able to enjoy much better than a guy next to
you.
I recommend you to see Ghost in the shell and read Gun Smith Cats
beforehand.  I believe the director loves Japanimation and Kung-fu
movies.
