The Matrix is undoubtedly the best major SF film of `99 (and don`t bother
with Star Wars Episode 1, which is bad beyond belief). But still, I think
it`s WAY overrated. The Film has a clever story, at least for the average
Hollywood Blockbuster, and some dazzling FX, but still... It could have
been
that much better if the creators just dropped the totally unnecessary
&quot;saviour&quot; storyline. Just imagine the film without it - no problem, and no
more stupid discussions on pointless, contradicting prophecies which
basically tell you to do what you want! For me, a film which could have
been
one of the great ones  but is merely entertaining (which in itself is a
virtue these days, don`t get me wrong!). 6/10.
