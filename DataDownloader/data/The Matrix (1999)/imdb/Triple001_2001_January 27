While not particularly the best film I've ever seen, 'The Matrix',
surprisingly enough, was actually as good as it was hyped up to be (unlike
a
lot of other movies).<br /><br />For the most part, it reached my expectations with its interesting plot
and
terrific effects, but unfortunately, it had a couple of disappointing
factors.<br /><br />First of all, I have to give it credit for the sufficient amount of
fighting
action throughout the film.  Though, I'm not sure if it was just me, but
their martial arts looked rather slow and a tad bit unconvincing (i.e. The
scene where Neo and Morpheus are fighting each other in the
Matrix).<br /><br />Secondly, and probably the most disappointing of all is the fact that
romance had to ruin the ending.  Personally, I think this movie could have
done without the Neo-Trinity love spark at the end as I was definitely not
expecting it to happen.  But since they're creating a sequel to 'The
Matrix', I hope they make up for it big time!
