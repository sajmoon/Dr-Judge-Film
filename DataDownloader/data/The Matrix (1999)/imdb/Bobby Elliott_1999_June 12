The Matrix is a science fiction movie that will mainly be enjoyed by fans
of
the genre. But if you like serious SF then you'll love The Matrix. The
film
has two main strands - there's the main storyline which is quite intricate
and complex and then there's the action movie-within-a-movie. The plot is
intelligent and mostly plausible but quite dense so you have to listen
carefully. The action sequences are surprisingly good thanks to superb
special effects. Don't be put off by the Kung-Fu comments. Yes, it does
have
this type of fighting but it's sensible in its context and the effects are
*outstanding*. So an intelligent, thought-provoking, thrilling movie - but
don't expect your granma' to like it - or your girlfriend unless she's
into
sci-fi or kung-fu. But for those who are then this is a top movie. I gave
it
8/10.
