Yeah well u probably know that this is a great movie.
i mean if u dont know anything about this movie then u like need to get
out
more.
But anyways this tells the story of the &quot;one&quot;. The one that will save all
of
humanity and that pretty much sets the pace for THE best action scenes
ever
done for a movie.
I mean these action scenes are done so well that it is overwhelming and i
have to say that this movie is the &quot;one&quot;. The one that will tell how other
movies should be done whether it is an action movie or a thriller or
anything
else.
I'd rate this a 10/10.
