1999_December 16 

This movie makes your eyes pop out of your head at least a dozen times,
but
the concept behind the storyline and the plot itself are lacking.  It
moves
well, but if you want good conceptual SF you're not going to find it here.
I still rated this an 8, but if the script was cleaned up a bit, it could
have been higher.
