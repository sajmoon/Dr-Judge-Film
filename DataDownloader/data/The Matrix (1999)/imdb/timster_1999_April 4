1999_April 4 

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Going in I was afraid it would be
little more than a vehicle for computer-animated special effects.  The story
held my interest, though.<br /><br />I thought the pacing and acting were both good.  The fight scenes were fun
and well choreographed.  Laurence Fishburne was very good as usual.  Keanu
Reeves has never really impressed me with his acting, but he was good
here.<br /><br />Worthy of a trip to see it on a big screen. <br /><br />
