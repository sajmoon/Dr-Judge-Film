1999_April 25 

This is the film that everyone is flocking to, and with good reason. I
cannot recall when I have had so much fun at a movie.<br /><br />Usually big blockbusters like this put me off because the need for special
effects eclipses good acting and writing. Fortunately, as a pleasant
surprise, this wasn't like that. Yes, Keanu Reeves still cannot act, but
Laurence Fishburne and especially Carrie-Ann Moss make the movie work on
that level..<br /><br />The story is way out-of-this-world. A computer crook seeks the answer to the
question &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;, and finds it. What he finds out is that his
reality is not actually reality itself. The story gets more complicated than
that, and as far as Science Fiction goes, this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />The Special Effects are spectacular. To say the very least. There is plenty
of fighting (Keanu's facial gestures during the fight scenes are
hysterical), shooting, cool weapons, and some awe-inspiring effects shots to
arouse the interest of almost any moviegoer. And all the characters look
especially cool in their dark clothes and custom sunglasses. For me, the
best parts of the movie were with Carrie-Ann Moss. She is definitely the
character every one liked the most in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. This is a movie that will
keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you breathless. A guaranteed good
time.
