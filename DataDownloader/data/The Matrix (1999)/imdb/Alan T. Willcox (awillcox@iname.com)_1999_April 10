1999_April 10 

The only thing new here is a few effects, and something resembling acting
from Keanu.  Prince &amp; the Pauper meets Brazil meets Vogue magazine.  old old
old.  Go see something else.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it's both over-written and underwritten.  OVER
meaning it tries way, way too hard (many in the audience were laughing).
UNDER meaning there are holes you could drive a truck through.
