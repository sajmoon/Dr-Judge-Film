Well, I heard a lots of bad stuff about The Matrix, and i heard a lots of
good stuff. I think is just great. It has a very interesting the theme
that
has touched the movie. Who knows if is real this world? But I don't think
this is the important part. We all have seen many love movies, and they
might be good movies. But in visual effects, this is real art!! Why should
just be romantic movies be considered as a good movie? Okay, probably the
interpretations of The Matrix are not the ones at the Schindler's list.
But
the visual effects makes that movie an important. Because made what cinema
was made for. ENTERTAIN! And sure that the movie got this
part!
