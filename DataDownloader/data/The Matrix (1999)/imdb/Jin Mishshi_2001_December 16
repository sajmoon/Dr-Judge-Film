The first time I watched this movie, it was really kool. TNT was airing it
three times: Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Awesome!!!! It was still kool
when
I watched the movie again!!! Can't wait for the sequel: The Matrix
Reloaded.
I give the movie nine for great graphics, action, and fighting. (can't say
anything anymore): ) All I have to say is Great movie!!!!!
