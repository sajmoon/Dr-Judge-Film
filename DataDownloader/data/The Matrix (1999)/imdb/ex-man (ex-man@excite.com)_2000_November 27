I first thought that this movie would be no more than the typical
action-packed summer movie.  But as you get more into the movie you
realize
that behind the action scenes and special effects there is an engaging and
intelligent plot driving the entire movie.  While not all viewers would
enjoy this, I think that everyone should at least give this movie a try.
It
is not to be missed.
