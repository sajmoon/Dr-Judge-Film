1999_September 5 

This film was good for a while.  After what I guess is &quot;the first half&quot;,
everything goes down.  This could have been finished to perfection (or close
to it).  But anyway, the acting was all right.  And the special effects were
one of the things the movie had going for it consistently.  I would rate it
a 5 or a 6.
