There are bad SF-movies. There are average ones. And good ones. There are
excellent ones as well. And there is The Matrix. One of the best SF movies
the big screen has ever featured. Every minute of the movie is full of
action and power, and I bet you've never seen such incredible slow motion
scenes anywhere. The bullet time walkthrough was filmed with 12 thousand
fps...
If you haven't seen it yet, do this. It is worth far more than the money you
pay for it...
