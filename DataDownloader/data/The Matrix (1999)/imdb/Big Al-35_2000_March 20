Why does everyone think this movie is excellent just because it has some
impressive special effects?  The Matrix sucked plain and simple.  I get more
pleasure from watching Kelly's Heroes!<br /><br />To put it simply, Keanu Reeves will never win an Oscar because he cannot
act.  The fact that he is in the movie makes it bad to begin
with.<br /><br />The plot was so boring I actually fell asleep on this movie three times.  I
finally made it through the whole film the fourth time because I cranked the
volume up to an intolerable level.<br /><br />Even after seeing most parts of this film more than once, I still can't see
what everyone is so worked up about.  Do yourself a favor and watch Three's
Company re-runs, they are much more entertaining!
