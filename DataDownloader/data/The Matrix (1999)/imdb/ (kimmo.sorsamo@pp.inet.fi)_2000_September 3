The Matrix is a combination of deep thoughts about technological
development
and tough action. The movie shows us in an intelligent way nightmares of
the
future world. The critic against too much virtual reality is needed,
because
who controls here in the middle of commercialism what is safe and good for
humankind?<br /><br />The outlook for the future that the film conveys to us is extremely sombre
and oppressive. The characters are not any more able to destinguish the
reality from the delution. Great visuality makes the movie more effective.
Unfortunately every profound thought is abandoned after the first hour when
endless action and unnecessary violence take the place.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is hired to this film for being a superman. His inadequate
skills for the serious acting must have been compensated with a lot of
action in the end. This is how the success is guaranteed: by the sufficient
number of action sequences which contain lots of kicking, shooting and
magical evasive movements.<br /><br />Thanks to Wachowski brothers&acute; direction that the first half of the movie is
worth seeing. The rest is to satisfy the desires of the masses with action,
and at the same time The Matrix revealed it&acute;s vanity.
