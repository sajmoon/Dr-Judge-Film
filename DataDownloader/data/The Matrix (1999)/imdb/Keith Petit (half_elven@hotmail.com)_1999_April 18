1999_April 18 

I loved The Matrix.  It was a visual ride and didn't condescend to its
audience for a moment in its plot, in the questions that it posed to its
audience.  However, the film could have been made even more compelling and
exciting with characters who were better developed and a stronger human
element to the story.  Still, it is the best science fiction film since
Strange Days (an underrated science fiction masterpiece) and the best
action
film since Face-Off.  (By science fiction, I mean true science fiction
that
uses technology to explore some question of human existence, not
straightforward action films that happen to take place in the future or,
as
in Star Wars, the distant past.)  It is the more compelling human stories
and well-crafted dialogue of these two films that give them the edge on
The
Matrix.
