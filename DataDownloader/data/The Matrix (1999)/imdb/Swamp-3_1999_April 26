Cool stuff!  Pooh on all those that say &quot;Bah Humbug&quot; and find fault.  The
Matrix rrrrrocked!!! They should have stayed home.  Go rent &quot;Room with a
View&quot; or some other such tripe if you can't allow yourself to be sucked into
another reality.  The rest of you, you'll come out of this movie wanting to
run up the walls and wonder if the only reason you can't is because you
didn't know that you could.  Make sense?  No?  Go see it............
because there is no spoon.
