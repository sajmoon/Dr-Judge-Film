this movie was a lot fun to watch, no movie in 1999 or even in the last
decennium can surpass it! It's better than Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Jaws,
The Truman Show, Blade Runner, Return of the Jedi, Jumanji, etc. (i know
these movies don't have really much to do with each other, but this just a
list of my favorite films). The only film that is better, to me, than the
Matrix, is Raiders of the Lost Ark. I love Morpheus' voice and also the
things he says about the world how it will in two centuries, are very
interesting AND scary. That's what i liked about this film, it was really
frightening. The kung fu scenes are really entertaining and fast, and
Keanu's acting is at its best. Trinity is really cool, it's unusual to see a
woman shooting all the bad guys. Agent Smith is a really cool villain, he's
one of the meanest guys in film history (especially the voice is very
creepy). This film actually doesn't have one dull moment in it. Anyone who
hasn't seen it, doesn't know what he's missing.
