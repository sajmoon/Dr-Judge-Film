1999_September 30 

A future ruled by computers! Obviously the Wachowski brothers weren't
using
Windows 98. The Ritz brothers could have made a better
movie.<br /><br />When will the Hollywood nit-wits get off the dogma that technology will be
the ruin of Mankind? I wish some scriptwriter will read H.G. Wells, just
once.<br /><br />But I will say something positive about this film. Love those costumes!
Must
have took a great deal of creativity to put everyone in
black.
