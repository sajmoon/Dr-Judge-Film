1999_June 13 

In a parallel universe William Gibson knocked this story out in a morning,
read it back and consigned it to oblivion. In the alternate reality that
is
late nineties cinema the story has resurfaced and stretched to over two
hours. You can tick off all the desirable style elements, herds of animals
contributing to the de rigeur black leather, more pistols packed than Lara
Croft with the endless ammo cheat and Keanu Reeves, the most other-worldly
element in the whole competent but workmanlike effort.
