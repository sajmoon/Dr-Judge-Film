When i saw the trailer for this movie back in 1999 it looked good and i
thought it was worth seeing but nothing prepared me for what i was
about to watch at the cinema when it came out on my birthday that June.
It blew my mind. I had never seen special effects like that before and
the acting was spot on. Keanu Reeves was the perfect cast for the role
as Neo. The directing was amazing and story was out of this world. The
editing is flawless. The writing is brilliant with a lot of one liners
such as &#x22;follow the white rabbit&#x22; and &#x22;if you take the red pill, you&#x27;ll
stay in wonderland and i&#x27;ll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes&#x22;. I
was glued to the screen. <br /><br />This film is an innovation and changed cinema forever. All the
groundbreaking filming techniques that were used in this movie has been
referred to and copied by almost every successful sc-fi, thriller or
action movie that has come out after the matrix. <br /><br />A movie that should be on your bucket list. If you have not seen this
movie yet go see it now. You will not been disappointed. Even if you
are not a sci-fi fan there&#x27;s something here for everyone. It will
excite you, free your mind and enjoy the ride. <br /><br />WATCH IT NOW!!!! ADD THIS TO YOUR DVD COLLECTION.
