1999_July 23 

Don't expect deep meaning. Don't try to logically figure it out - the more
you do the sillier it gets. Just sit back and enjoy this piece of visual
eye-candy.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves actually does an adequate job, which is a lot for him. The
special effects are pretty amazing. This should set the standard for the
next big super-hero movie.<br /><br />The film makers were definitely going for a Hong Kong/Japanese look to the
film, and I think that's a wise move. Today's audiences are looking for
larger than life action films with some style and an edge, and the film
works great on that level.<br /><br />So far it's my favorite movie of 1999 because it was better than I
expected.
It's been a while since a movie did that.
