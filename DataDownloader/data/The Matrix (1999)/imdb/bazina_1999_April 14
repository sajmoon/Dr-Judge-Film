1999_April 14 

This film has planted a fever in my brain - was there a subliminal message
throbbing out of the screen telling us 'you must see this again'? I feel
like an invisible thread is luring me back to the cinema to immerse myself
again in this glorious fiction. Even though its premise is dystopic, the
action/fight/gravity defying sequences are truly exhilarating and may make
the unhinged among us think for a brief moment that maybe they can fly
too.<br /><br />I can't tell you how strange it was to watch the familiar buildings and
streets of Sydney (my home city) constructed as part of a computer
generated
illusion, and then to drive past many of the filming locations on the way
home. Disconcertingly dreamlike to say the least! Go see it - I promise
that
it will show you things you've never seen or maybe never dreamt before.
