1999_July 27 

The Matrix is the BEST movie of 1999, as well as the best sci-fi movie ever
made and also one of my favorites of all time!  The Matrix is one of those
movies like Usual Suspects which holds you from the opening credits and does
not let up til the lights come on in the theater.  By now we all know the
story behind the Matrix and how great the special effects and action was,
but I noticed that most people forgot to mention the deepth of the
story.<br /><br />Yes!  Matrix is an action movie, but it is also Biblical in many ways.  Neo
is Jesus... he is the &quot;one&quot; selected to free the people from persecution. 
Cypher is the deciple who betrayed Christ... he sold out Morpheous for
materialistic items and was then was forever banished from the real world.
Morpheous is God... the all knowing, he is everywhere, yet nowhere.  And
Trinity is the Virgin Mary, for it was her efforts which brought Neo to the
&quot;real world&quot;.  Other references include Zion,the Nebucanezhar and the
Oracle.<br /><br />I have seen this film three times, will see it again at the theaters and I
am definetly going to purchase the DVD on Oct. 5.  Forget Phantom Menace,
the Matrix is IT!
