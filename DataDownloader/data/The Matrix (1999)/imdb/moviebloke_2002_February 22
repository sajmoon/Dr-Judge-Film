As we have already seen, The Matrix has been imitated and satirized for its
ground-breaking cinematography. This movie is, for lack of a better word,
astounding. During the first half of the movie, the audience is drawn in to
find out what the matrix really is. When we find out, we certainly aren't
disappointed. This film takes existentialism to a new level in
visualization. The Wachowski brothers and Joel Silver did a magnificent job
making this film. Keanu Reeves' minimal lines proved to be a smart choice
in
that his low quality acting didn't interfere too much with the movie. The
only real weakness of the film, was that ending the movie with a love story
was sappy and ill-timed. I wouldn't have minded if Carrie-Anne Moss'
character simply protested her love to Keanu Reeves' character, but the
fact
that it brought him back to life was a mistake. With all things considered,
no one should miss this movie. See it! All of you!
