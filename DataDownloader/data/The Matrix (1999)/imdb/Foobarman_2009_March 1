The Matrix is a truly excellent movie. Although the movie is a bit hard
to follow the brilliant action scenes totally make up for it. This is
personally my favorite Matrix movie. This is one of the movies I have
watched the most. I bought the DVD - and I think it was certainly worth
it.<br /><br />The casting, acting and production of the movie is great. They chose
the perfect actor of Agent Smith and Neo. They suited their roles
perfectly and did an excellent job. The filming and camera angles were
great and made the action scenes as good as they were.<br /><br />Although, I wish the movie was easier to understand (I finally got it
after like the fifth time I watched it).<br /><br />This is certainly one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.
