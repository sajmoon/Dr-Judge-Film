I saw this movie a few days ago, and I just thought it was brilliant.
Fantastic piece of entertainment.  The stunning special effects were, of
course, the best thing about the movie.  Wow.  The acting was nothing
impressive, but I thought that got covered pretty well by the special
effects and the plot.  I thought the plot was great, actually.  I thought
it
was going to be pretty crap but it wasn't.  I think that's a thrillingly
frightening idea -- that the whole world could be one big computerised
fake.<br /><br />However, I must say that I really wouldn't put it at no.38 or whatever it
was in that list of the top movies of all time.  It's easy to be overcome
by
all the hype surrounding the movie; I reckon you gotta give a movie at
least
10 years before even considering putting it on a &quot;Top-movies-of-all-time&quot;
list.<br /><br />But anyway, what an awesome movie!!  Three cheers for all the Aussies
involved in the film!!  Yeah yeah yeah!!!
