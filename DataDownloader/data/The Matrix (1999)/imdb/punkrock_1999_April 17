The &quot;Matrix&quot; really gets your mind working. The special effects are great
but I don't think that that is what makes it a good Movie. The &quot;Matrix&quot;
has a
great plot and it's original. The characters were portrayed very well,
especially Laurance Fishburne as &quot;Morpheus&quot; and Keanu Reeves is the
perfect
match for Neo, I had my Doubts about him but after I saw it I Thought he
was
great.If you think it's a bad movie you better see it again because
obviously
you didn't understand it<br /><br />The first time you see this Movie Many ideas will pop into your head about
what's going on, the dialogue was planned out very well and it's hard to
tell
what the plot is at first. you really don't know what's happening until
&quot;Neo&quot;
meets up with &quot;Morpheus&quot; and he shows him what the &quot;Matrix&quot;
is.<br /><br />I rated This Movie a 10 Because I love the plot and dialogue. and the
special effects help too. Basically it's an all-around good
Movie.
