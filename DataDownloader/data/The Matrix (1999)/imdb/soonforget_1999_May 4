1999_May 4 

This film is truly phenomenal, to say the least.  I have seen it 7 times
and
I do plan on seeing it at least 1 more time.  It makes me think about
numerous things each time I see it.  It touches base on a spiritual level,
intellectual, visual, as well as containing some pretty groovy dialogue
and
some kick a$$ visual effects (Carrie-Ann Moss) and fight scenes.  Sure to
be
my favorite film of the year, possibly decade.   ****
