1999_December 12 

n extremely well-done piece of work, which is very enjoyable if you allow
yourself to suspend your disbelief.  Great performances by all involved,
even Reeves (who makes up in spades for &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;) and especially
Hugo Weaving, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Ann Moss.  Brilliant use of
special effects which should win the Academy Awards hands down (but might
suffer from being an April release.  Great set design, brilliant
cinematography.<br /><br />The move also has, without revealing too much, tons of science fiction and
martial arts jokes and references (for those who have seen the movie, think
of: the two pills, the White Rabbit, the dojo scene).  Also this movie is a
weird pleasure for Chicagoans, as all of the street references are Chicago
streets (though there is no subway at Lake and Wells).  The movie was
filmed
in Sydney, but could be anywhere (though Sydney does appear to have some
weird skyscrapers).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
