1999_April 10 

A combination of &quot;arcade-style&quot; action fighting, freaky looking special
effects and a mild topping of Sci-Fi plot equals around two hours of
entertainment.<br /><br />Trenchcoat and Sunglass manufacturers have got to be happy.<br /><br />Also, I was proud to see Sydney's buildings can get shot up as good as the
next city's.<br /><br />One criticism though, I was disappointed with the ending.
