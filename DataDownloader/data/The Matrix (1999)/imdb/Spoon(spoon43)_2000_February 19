2000_February 19 

When I first saw this film I came out ecstatic. I've seen the film dozens
of
times since then and my original impression remains.  The film operates on
so many levels and is so intricately woven that it withstands such
scrutiny.
Of course it has its faults, but like its merits, they are entirely
dependent on the viewer's point of view.  I kept my mouth shut upon exiting
the theatre for the first time, and sure enough, all of my companions
praised it, but each for different reasons.  The film acts very much like a
mirror in that way: each viewer seems to pick up on the themes that
resonate
with them the most.  I, for one, relate to the notion that reality is
entirely subjective... the world IS as we think it is.  (that, and
Carrie-Anne Moss rocks...)
