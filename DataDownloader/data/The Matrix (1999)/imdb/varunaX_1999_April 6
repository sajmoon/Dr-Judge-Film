1999_April 6 

This is one of the very first movies that actually made me think in the
theater.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; had some very intriguing lines that made you ponder
the most obvious things around us.  Such as when Morpheus (Fishburne) says
to Neo (Reeves), &quot;You believe it is the year 1999, when actually it is
closer to 2199...&quot; and he goes on to explain the down fall of our world as
we know it to &quot;AI&quot; artificial intelligence and machines.  Also, when
Morpheus confuses Neo by questioning his definition of &quot;real&quot;:  &quot;What is
real?  How do you define real?  If to you real is what you can see or touch
or smell, then it is simply electrical signals being sent to your brain.&quot;<br /><br />We are born into a world which we do not question or take a 2nd glance at.
It is a world based on &quot;rules&quot;.  It is given to us, therefore we accept it
for what it is and nothing more. This is in fact the underlying theme of &quot;The
Matrix&quot; and how we go on living our lives oblivious.  Making the Fishburne's
quote  &quot;Do you really think that's air your breathing right now?&quot; very
believable.<br /><br />With all this thinking going on, you are bound to miss some of the best
martial arts fighting sequences I have seen to date.  Using slow motion to
the fullest, the action sequences are given a type of grace, such as when
Fishburne is floating in the air in the dojo sequence.  This uncut, kung fu
style fighting is sure to leave the audience with a smile of pure enjoyment
on their faces.
In all, this is the best movie I have seen and must be seen more than
once to appreciate the plot, the morals, the action, the camera angles, and
excellent acting by all 4 main cast members.  I strongly recommend this
movie to anyone who is willing to &quot;free their mind&quot;.
