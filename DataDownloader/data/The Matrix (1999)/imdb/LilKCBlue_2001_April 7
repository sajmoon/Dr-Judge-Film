I can't tell you how many times I have seen this MASTERPIECE!!!<br /><br />This movie gets better and better everytime.<br /><br />Although the main reason I like this movie is not for the special effects.
I love it for the story.  It asks the question, WHAT IF?!!<br /><br />The kung-fu choriography is bad-ass also.  The scene where Neo (Keanu
Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) make a big shootout in the lobby is
great.  That's pretty much why I have seen this movie so many times.  The
movie DOES have biblical porportians but I don't think many Christians
would
complain, being one myself.<br /><br />Well, all in all, this movie is great.  See it again and again.  I swear I
will be first in line to see the sequals.
