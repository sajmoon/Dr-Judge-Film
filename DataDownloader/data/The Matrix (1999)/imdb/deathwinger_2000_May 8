Amazing and almost original movie (anybody saw Dark City)
The guns scenes were the best match to my favourite director John
Woo.
The Combat scenes were shot like the old Martial Arts movies.
The dramatical performance was moving.
And that space/time stoppage while dodging bullets KICKED BUTT!
:P<br /><br />Overall, this movie shows that America still has hope for movies that can
use the best elements to put together a film. I hope to see more Wachoski
Bros.<br /><br />P.S. (Try a Mexican standoff two guys shooting and dodging scene, that'll
kick!)
