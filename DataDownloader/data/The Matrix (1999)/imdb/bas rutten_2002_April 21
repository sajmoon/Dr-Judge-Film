&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a very interesting action/sci-fi movie, that's definetely
more memorable for the cinematography and action sequences then it is for
the story.<br /><br />I won't go into details here, but the story, although certainly original, is
really too far-fetched and sometimes downright nonsensical. The story does,
however, offer a plausible explanation as to why all the exorbitant action
sequences (people stalling in mid-air, running against walls, dodging
bullets etc) are possible, and in the end it's those action sequences that
make it all worthwile: they are simply very cool.<br /><br />It doesn't happen often, but in this case I'd say that the &quot;coolness&quot; of the
action sequences more then makes up for any plot holes. All in all &quot;The
Matrix&quot; is excellent.<br /><br />*** out of **** stars
