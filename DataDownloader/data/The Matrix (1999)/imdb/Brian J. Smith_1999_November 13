1999_November 13 

The Matrix is virtual reality taken to the extreme. It was one of the most
successful movies of 1999 and one can see why. Its full of state of the art
special effects, expertly choreographed fights and dashing heroes, a
beautiful heroine and evil villains.<br /><br />I had a little trouble with the story, however. We are supposed to believe
that the world as we know it is a computerized matrix and that nothing is
real. Laurence Fishburne and his gang of &quot;rebels&quot; are supposed to be
fighting the evil &quot;agents&quot; through some form of virtual reality transfers
from their &quot;ship&quot; back and forth to the &quot;real world&quot;. And we are supposed to
accept Keannu Reeves,the hero, as the &quot;second coming&quot;? Give me a
break.<br /><br />Reeves is OK as the super hero and Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the
leader of the rebel forces. I also liked Carrie-Anne Moss as the heroine and
wish more had developed between her and the Reeves character.<br /><br />I know that I'm in a minority, but special effects aside, I just thought
that The Matrix was a little to far-fetched to be believable.
