1999_April 6 

Hey, what's happening to science fiction in movies? Time was, Science
Fiction on film broke down
easily into just a few basic food groups:<br /><br />Most of it is basic &quot;space opera&quot;, westerns and detective stories
transplanted to the future, pretty much
the same conflicts existing in our time and country, transplanted to other
planets or outer space, in the
far future. Regional conflicts become global, global conflicts become
galactic. Basic formula made fresh
by the environment.<br /><br />Rarely, it is satire, examining today's social problems, disguised in
space
suits and different species.<br /><br />But if you wanted to examine the extrapolation of serious, thoughtful
ideas,
you really had to read a
book. The best science fiction is too involved, too convoluted, too
complicated for the movies,
because it challenges our very philosophy of existence, and actually makes
us THINK. So you only found
it in books most of the time.<br /><br />Until lately. Lately, some brave producers have dared to test our patience
and willingness to look and
listen. These dares have not always worked, or even entertained, but it's
the thought that counts.<br /><br />Last year, the thought that counted was DARK CITY, a cartoony combination
of
NOIR, Animae, and other
derivations that held our interest with far more than an adventure story
set
in some futuristic world. It
played with our heads with a far more sinister idea than the Truman Show,
and compelled us to ask fun
questions. Cool stuff. That thought counted. And the look of it was nifty
too.<br /><br />This year, THE MATRIX offers another wild ride that goes beyond the 'oh
wow'
school of sci fi flicks,
and also dares to question our comfortable notion of the very nature of
existence and reality. Whoa!
Heavy! Tough stuff for movie fans today.<br /><br />This is old stuff to those who read science fiction, of course. We
Luddites
of the printed page have
seen this many times before, and done better in books, but to make a
shoot-em-up, thunder-action dark
movie thriller with THAT as a premise, is daring indeed. Oh my, here it is
in a movie. A movie? Yes,
and so we see the reviews that call it 'complicated', 'obtuse',
'confusing',
'confused', and 'vague.' No,
actually, it just asks us to pay attention, something usually unheard of
in
a sci fi flick.<br /><br />The casting of Keanu Reeves, contrary to what you've read, is actually
right
on. That vague, clueless
look of his is perfect for this part. But Bill &amp; Ted didn't know they were
clueless on their way to an
excellent adventure, and so had all the foundation in reality they needed
to
sustain them. In this film,
poor Keanu has nothing strong enough, and he responds exactly as any REAL
semi-conscious nerd
might---eyes and mouth half-open all the time. It adds to the
verisimilitude. I far prefer that to the
easily-adaptable scientist/warrior who quickly accepts mind-reading slugs
and methane-breathing
intelligent plants as the new norm. I LIKE a helpless confused punk in
full
denial of a new reality. Much
more true to 'life', which adds to the irony.<br /><br />As usual, you should forget the machinery in this show-it doesn't really
make sense on any level, and
that's not the point anyhow. Plotholes abound, but the effects are so good
and the action is so swift
and confusing, as it is meant to be, that you really won't care. The look
of
the sets, lighting, and
costumes will maintain your view as much as the high-level effects. Sure,
you can add up the
contrivances in the conflict easily, but you'll be talking about the
premise, effects, and outrageously
overplayed villains long after you leave the theater, and that's more than
you can say for &quot;Analyze This!&quot;<br /><br />The movie makes many excellent choices: It makes no apologies for the
Alice-in-Wonderland
references, and in fact, depends on them. Sydney Australia stands in for
the
nightmarish cityscape that
serves as only ONE of the film's realities. Joe Pantoliano, scene-stealer
from The Fugitive and U.S.
Marshals, shines above the unknowns in the supporting cast. Lawrence
Fishburne is way cool as the Yoda
behind the stylish shades. The bad guy playing 'Agent Jones' is a
wonderfully disgusting, overplaying
goon, proving that the film refuses to take itself too seriously. Thank
God
for that.<br /><br />Evidence of &quot;The Committee&quot; is here--that notorious round table of cooks
that keep tossing
audience-grabbing conventions into the mix: Martial arts, secret meetings,
girls in leather, never-empty
guns, explosions, breaking glass, 'copter-crashes, the training of the
Jedi-type warrior, the invincible
evil ones, cool computer screens, car chases, roof top chases, street
chases, and various uhh, chases.<br /><br />It works in spite of the committee. Who are you really? Are you dreaming
this? What does 'd&eacute;j&agrave; vu'
really mean? Can we disregard time, space, and gravity?<br /><br />Somebody actually answers all these questions correctly in this film.<br /><br />It entertains, and it gives you some stuff to hash around at the coffee
shop
afterwards.<br /><br />Can this be a trend? Dark City last year, The Matrix this year,
atmospheric
dark thrillers that go far
beyond wild action alone?<br /><br />Hope so.<br /><br />Check it out from the very last row of the theater, where you can
appreciate
the entire composition of
the frame. Just one more thing worth noticing in what was supposed to be
just another action flick for
the kids.
