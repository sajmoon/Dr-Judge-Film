1999_September 15 

I've seen the rate of this movie and I can't believe it... Are you crazy?
This movie must be the most overrated of IMDB with difference. If I had to
say anything about it is one word: unbelievable. The plot is superficial and
the pseudo-deep-philosophy all of you are talking about is bad builded (have
you any idea of the electric potential of human neurones? My God! What a
poor energy source for the Matrix!). All of you thinking that an Sci-Fic
movie doesn't need logical don't know nothing about GOOD
Sci-Fic.<br /><br />I admit that the first part of the movie is decent: while Neo still ignores
all about the Matrix there is an enigmatic atmosphere that gives suspense to
the film. But the second part is boring and stupid. Just a lot of
shot-sounds to turn everybody deaf. The fighting scenes made laugh all the
theatre (suspension of disbelief? Ja! ) and when Carrie Ann Moss says she
just needs a lesson to pilot the helicopter was ridiculous. However, I think
Moss was the better of the cast. I've found Keanu too cold and Fishburne was
as his character's name: Morpheus, that is, made me want to sleep. And the
Oracle! Who casted that horrible actress?<br /><br />The only good of the film was the a-la William Gibson cyber-style of
costumes and the FX. Of course, nothing to be in the 26th place of top250.
This film should *NOT* be neither in the top250 nor in the
top500.<br /><br />And how can you compare this with Philip K. Dick's Blade Runner???? Are you
joking, KIDS?<br /><br />I give it a 5 of 10 out and only for the FX.
