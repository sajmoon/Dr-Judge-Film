..from the acting to the soundtrack, to the visual effects, to all
the twists...I just loved the fact that I could; FOR ONCE; watch a sci-fi
movie and actually *understand* it the first time around.<br /><br />But what I loved the most is how this flick takes you to another world. A
world where being the lead character requires you to do the hardest things,
because they're the right things. Like Blade Runner's Ford and &quot;5th
Element's&quot; Willis, this movie takes you to another world; futuristic and
intense.<br /><br />How cool was it to refer to having 'deja-vu' as experiencing a glitch in the
Matrix. &quot;It's when they change something&quot;, Moss replies. That was cool!<br /><br />Not sure about the plot holes, though. I didn't realize there were any.<br /><br />I *do* think there could've been a lot less &quot;gun&quot; violence...the White
Zombie song playing in the background while Reeves and Moss blow away
innocent people could've easily been playing during martial arts scenes or
the slow-motion 'dodge-the-bullet' moves.<br /><br />Either way, 'The Matrix' is a 9.5 out of 10.
