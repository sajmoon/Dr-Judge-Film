I thought this movie was amazing.  Sure a few of the scenes made me tired
just looking at them, but isn't that part of the fun? I also thought that
Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast, as well as Moss and Fishburne. The
effects
are absolutely awesome. I don't know why so many people didn't like this
movie; it was pure entertainment. It is one of the best movies I have seen
in a long time, and I think that anyone is looking for 2 hours of sci-fi
action and adventure should also check it out.<br /><br />I still say, if you want a good movie, check out The Matrix.
