I have not seen a movie in a long time that made for such interesting
conversations and discussions.  Yet this one just gripped my mind, twisted
it, made it more agile and perceptive, and amazed it.<br /><br />I've never been a special effects buff, so though I enjoyed the cool
visual
scenes (and the people are pretty darn nice to look at too), they are not
what draws me to the movie.  What attracts me soooo much, is the way the
movie presents one of the most difficult, perhaps the only really
unanswered
philosophical question - Is this real?  The movie's awesome storytelling
sequencing introduces such a disturbing possible answer to that question
that it just makes you think and think, and think some more.  Few movies,
even books, are able to do that.<br /><br />And even beyond the central theme of reality, it also raises so many other
concepts through its subtle suggestions.  For example, the fact that human
maybe developing technology at a pace that far outpace their ability to
understand and control it is suggested very effectively by Morpheus'
narration of how things got that way.  And even the despicable characters,
like Agent Smith, brings up eye opening ideas that man is consumming the
Earth beyond its sustainability.  The answer to what deja vus really are,
and countless other thought provoking details can only be sought out by
watching the movie over and over.  And it's the fact that this movie makes
people think that makes it far superior to other sci/fi, action movies of
today's Hollywood.
