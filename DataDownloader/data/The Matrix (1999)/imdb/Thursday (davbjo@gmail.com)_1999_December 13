This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's really got
everything you could ever ask. Thrill, excitement and action!<br /><br />One other point, and a rather big one, is that this movie doesn't rely on
special effects. All the FX are a part of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece, and should be treated as one. Rent it, watch
it, buy it! :)
