1999_April 26 

No, Keanu Reeves still isn't Laurence Olivier, but thank God, he *doesn't*
have to be.  He has the right look for this movie and he was excellent in
his action scenes.  The rest of the cast was superb. I am not a big Sci-Fi
movie-goer, but they succeeded on all levels with this one--the script, the
casting, the look of the future (ewww!).  They also did a very credible job
mixing mysticism with high tech. I absolutely LOVED this movie, and I'm not
waiting for video.  I'm going to see it again!!  &quot;The Matrix&quot;
*rocks*.
