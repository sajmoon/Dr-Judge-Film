The Matrix is a movie that you cannot simply watch while doing another
task
or when you are not focusing your full attention upon the movie. It is
the
type of movie where you must listen and follow every piece of dialogue to
understand how detailed and beautiful the film is.<br /><br />When watching the film, you must look past all of the hype of it being an
action film, although the action sequences are some of the best in an
American movie. You must realize that this is a mind blowing sci-fi film
that makes you think about your own existance here on earth.<br /><br />All of the actors in the film fit their parts, from Keanu Reaves as Neo,
the
saviour of the human race to Laurence Fishburne, the man to guide Neo on
his
journey. The Wachowski Brothers have done an outstanding job on this
film.
It will be a question weather or not Matrix Reloaded can be as good or
better than the first when it comes out in May of 2003. Nonetheless, The
Matrix is outstanding film that will make you ask questions almost
everyday.<br /><br />10/10
