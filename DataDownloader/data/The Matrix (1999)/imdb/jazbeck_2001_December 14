This movie is terrific, not only the special effects are cool, but so are
the actor's performances and the story.<br /><br />I admit that this is my favorite movie, but I know that some of you IMDb
users know that all this stuff has been used before (not much... but it has
been used). The real great thing about this movie are not the special
effects,neither the story... but the way they used all the elements. They
KNEW how to use them, not like DARK CITY or other movies of this kind...<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me is that people just can't get it... they say
the movie is right just because the visual effects or the sound track, but
they don't realize that they are watching a great piece of art... made with
many different and sometimes &quot;recycled&quot; elements.<br /><br />We all have seen this story before, but never like this, I mean, there are
two other stories to compare this one to:<br /><br />1) Dark City, The 13th floor or other movies.<br /><br />2) Jesus.<br /><br />So, I ultra highly recommend this movie, and also give you a
tip:<br /><br />You should watch all the action scenes and kung-fu fights, then watch the
hole movie, You'll feel a very different sensation... the first one is like
watching a &quot;star wars movie type&quot; (A lot of action, but no plot) and when
you watch the hole thing you'll realize that the influence is so big, that
the prove of it are all the 2000's action movies.<br /><br />WATCH IT...IT'S ALMOST THE OBLIGATORY MOVIE FOR THE NEW
CENTURY
