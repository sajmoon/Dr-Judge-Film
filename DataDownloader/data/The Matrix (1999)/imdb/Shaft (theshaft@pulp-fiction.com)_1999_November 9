1999_November 9 

First of all I want to disagree with some other people's reviews on IMDb.
One person said that this movie had bad acting and bad special effects. Bad
special effects!? I'm not a giant fan of this CGI stuff but if you think
the
effects in this movie are bad you're blind (see the bullet-time scene
again). The acting was great except for Keanu Reeves, but give him a
break -
he tried his best.<br /><br />The flaws I saw were not that important to other people, but almost ruined
it for me. The violence was totally unrealistic. When people get shot they
bleed, and out of the all the people that are shot in this movie I only saw
one person bleed. Now I'm not all into seeing people getting mutilated when
they get shot in movies, but I thought that needed to be shown. The only
other thing was the characters always spoke in metaphors which can get VERY
annoying after a while. Other than that you have a high quality movie with
great action sequences, good acting, excellent special effects, and a great
(but unoriginal) plot. You'll have a great time watching this
movie.<br /><br />My rating: ***1/2 stars out of ****
