The Movie matrix has two worlds in it, one is the real world and the
other is the Matrix world. Accordingly there is a difference in the
sound when anyone from the real world goes into the matrix. This is
what makes this movie different from the other action movies. For
instance when Trinity shot one of the agents in the movie, there is a
metallic sound after which the agent changes into someone else&#x27;s dead
body. One more instance is when Neo sees himself in the mirror and
touches it by which there is a change in his voice as the liquid goes
into his mouth which again makes a metallic sound. So sound is the
movie has a dominant role to distinguish between both the worlds.
