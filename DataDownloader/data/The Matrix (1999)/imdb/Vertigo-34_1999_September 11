1999_September 11 

The MATRIX was a movie that had it all.  Anyone who has enjoyed the
Terminator films (sci-fi, back-in-time) and Jackie Chan films (choreographed
fight scenes) will LOVE and CHERISH this film !!
All performances were convincing, the action non-stop, and the plot was
solid and had many varying levels of symbolism, meaning, and
relevance.
I could go on, but I must be going now, I am about to see the movie for the
sixth time !!
