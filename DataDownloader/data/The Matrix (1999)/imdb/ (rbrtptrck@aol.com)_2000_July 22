2000_July 22 

From sleeping in slime to eating bowls of it, this film is the ultimate
infantile S &amp; M &quot;action movie&quot; so far.  The mental age of movies is
shrinking every year.  This one has regressed to playing with body products
and fearing bugs will bore into one's navel. All of society seems an evil
plot to the infantile ego, which wants only -- well, it doesn't know what
it
wants, so it fills its anxiety-ridden idleness with paranoid fantasies of
persecution and megalomanic schemes of being a Messiah -- with holes all
over him and GREAT sunglasses.  This pathetically pathological film blames
everything for its hero's seething frustration except the thing most
responsible -- the mesmerizing commercials on TV which have made young
Americans despise themselves and feel inferior to the heroes and models
they
watch while they slump ever-deeper into their couches. How can the sequel
be
even more immature?  Only by having the Matrix satisfy even more infantile
fears by having controlling tentacles thrust up into the unwary rebels up
out of toilet water.  Films like this are harmless, but the egocentric
insecurities they cater to are a cultural tragedy.
