Thomas A. Anderson is in trouble. Words appear on his computer screen,
telling him to &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot;. He does, and a mysterious woman
named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) tells him that &quot;they have been looking
for
him&quot; and says something about the Matrix, leaving Thomas very confused. In
his work the next day, Thomas is chased by some guys. Not exactly &quot;good
guys&quot;. He meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Morpheus tells him that
once he goes into the real world, he can never go back. Thomas, who
becomes
Neo, does. And he finds out about the Matrix and everything.<br /><br />That may not make sense, but it does in the movie. Thomas A. Anderson/Neo
is
played by Keanus Reeves, keeping his status as &quot;cool action dude&quot; real. He
originally is skeptical, but soon learns the truth, and he begins, shall I
say, enjoy it.<br /><br />The Matrix draws you in with special effects gadgets and weird things, but
soon teeters away from that, making you glued to your seat because you're
wating for the next one. While there are tremondous special effects (some
were under-utilized, I'm assuming they'll be in the sequels), some of the
characters came and went, and the script (by the directors, the Wachowski
brothers) didn't really introduce them to us. Maybe if a little less of
the
fighting (which was very cool) and more of the basics had been there, it
would have been easier.<br /><br />Of course, movies like this can't be without mumbo-jumbo. The mystical
Morpheus does most of it-talking philosophically and not making sense at
times. I got the rudimentary idea behind most of it (like that they
actually
didn't go the Matrix, etc.), but it tried to get oo in-depth.<br /><br />The Matrix was fun and enjoyable, with some heartpounding scenes and cool
special effects (love that bullet-stopping). The acting was all very
good-Reeves, as I've said before, was good and might be coming back.
Fishburne is good as the guy who knows everything but cannot speak it
(i.e.
Dobby?), and I love Moss-she's great and a rising action star. I didn't
really notice that Joe Pantoliano was there, but his voice sounded
familiar.
He looks a lot different than from Memento.<br /><br />The Matrix is a fun FX ridden piece that doesn't waste time on &quot;trivial&quot;
aspects such as characters.<br /><br />My rating: 7/10<br /><br />Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language.
