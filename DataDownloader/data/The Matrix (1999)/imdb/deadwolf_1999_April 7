1999_April 7 

I just saw the Matrix, and well yes it was a good movie no doubt, but the
plot was given away in the first 9 minutes... and well I was expecting a
little bit more out of a sci-fi movie. And the end is a little disappointing.
But other than that it was a damn fine movie to watch... the effects were
great, the cast fought nice with other profiles.
