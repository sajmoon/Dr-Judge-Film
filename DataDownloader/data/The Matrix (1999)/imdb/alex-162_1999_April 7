1999_April 7 

Almost every film can be compared to two or three other films such as,
&quot;Volcano&quot;=&quot;Dante's Peak&quot; meets &quot;Earthquake&quot;. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is, Terminator and
Terminator 2 meets Total Recall meets Men in Black meets Hackers meets Dark
City meets Seven Monkeys.<br /><br />It combined all these ideas from the movies (I think anyways)and came up
with a cool idea that doesn't really rip off these films. The &quot;Star Wars
Trilogy&quot; did the same thing, except it got its ideas from historic events,
and historic things, historic people (Hitler, Knights,
Soldiers).<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; idea was in a way original. I like the idea of the future that
no one Knows of or cares except a few individuals who found out the truth
and are fighting to destroy the Matrix.
The idea that you can alter things and get what you want within seconds such
as billions of guns and learning to fly a helicopter.<br /><br />This film deserves 4.5/5
