2000_July 7 

Have you noticed over the past decade or so a lot of American films have
been trying to capture that Hong Kong feeling but rarely succeed? Why do
most of them suck so bad? Could it be the crappy stories? No, HK films
have
plenty of those (sorry Mr. Woo). I think it's the American's inability to
totally go for broke in the action scenes. The Matrix could have been made
without a huge gun battle at the end, but what fun would that be? That was
just the iceing on the cake (the cake being the terrific story cooked up
by
the Wachowski bros).<br /><br />Okay, buy now we all know what an amazing film The Matrix is, so let me
sprinkle a few of my thoughts about it here. Let's start with Keanu. In
one
of the most interesting reviews I read in praise of this film, someone
dissected why Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice to star in this film.
Now,
if you're like me, you're not a huge Keanu Reeves fan. Matter of fact,
before seeing it my opinion of the Matrix was, &quot;Looks cool. Too bad it's
starring Keanu&quot;. Well, he didn't bother a bit, in fact I rather enjoyed
his
performance in it. Before seeing it, the opinion of a wide variety of
people
was &quot;I do not buy Keanu Reeves as an action hero&quot;. Well, that's exactly
why
he works. Walking in to the movie we don't believe he could be the chosen
one of anything. Gradually, he starts to win us over and by the end, even
the hard core Keanu haters are cheering him on. Why? Because he doesn't
believe he's the chosen one either. We don't buy it and neither does his
character, Neo (anagram, anyone?), Which makes his transformation at the
end
all the more powerful. Making him just right for this movie.<br /><br />Now, a word to critics who disliked the film because it &quot;degenerated&quot; into
a
mindless shoot-em-up in the last half hour. Some saw this film as a
thought
provoking science fiction movie on par with Dark City and Blade Runner
that
lost its brains in the third act. Let's clarify something. THIS IS AN
ACTION
MOVIE. That is what this movie is, it just confuses some people because it
actually has a story (a first for most summer action movie fans). How can
we
beg for summer action blockbusters that actually have a plot, and then
chastise it when it finally comes along? Is that fair? Instead of thinking
of it as a smart Sci-fi with unnecessary action scenes, think of it as an
action film with a smart story. It's just that easy.<br /><br />And lastly, it needs to be pointed out that the Matrix is a total rip-off
of
Grant Morrison's The Invisibles comic book. I know, you're thinking,
&quot;Well,
everything is ripped off of something and you can probably trace all
stories
back to the Holy Bible in some form or another&quot;. Well, that what I thought
until I actually saw the book myself. To sum up the book as Grant himself
did once, The Invisibles is the story of a group of people dressed in
leather led by a bald guy in sunglasses that's trying to make humanity see
that the world they know is not the real world, all the while being hunted
by a group of inhuman &quot;agents&quot; who don't want this to happen. Eerie
coincidences, eh? No, not really. The Wachowskis are former comic writers
themselves (I even have a few of the Hellraiser stories one of them did).
They frequently collaborate with comic artists, recently on The Matrix web
site and in the comic book handed out at the Matrix screenings ('till it
got
pulled), and some top comic artists designed machines used in the movie
and
did story boards for the film. Oh, and Warner Bros owns DC Comics,
publisher
of Grant's Invisibles comic. I smell a conspiracy, Agent Mulder. Because
of
the Matrix, Grant will never get an Invisibles movie made without
comparisons being made to the Matrix, and his movie would be seen as a rip
off of Matrix, instead of the other way around. Grant himself admits that
he
loves the movie, but I think he's through with DC saying something to the
effect of, &quot;I won't be used as cheap source of ideas for Warner Bros
movies&quot;. He still hasn't received any aknowldgement for his part, and of
coarse he hasn't recieved any money from it. It's a shame, really. Would
Grant's Invisibles have made as good a film as the Matrix? I doubt it, but
it would have been nice to see.<br /><br />That said, I loved this movie. Can't wait for the sequel(s?). 10/10 stars.
G'night!
