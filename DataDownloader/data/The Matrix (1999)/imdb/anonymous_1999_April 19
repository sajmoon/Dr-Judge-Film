The Matrix, according to Martin Heidegger's posthumous comments, is the
conclusion of the destining of the last 2000 years of western philosophy
(or, at least, the last couple of hours of western philosophy).  First,
Plato's myth of the cave - then much later - Descartes' pineal gland and its
vibrations, Locke's secondary qualities, self-enclosed non-disclosive Humean
impressions, Kant's appearances -- and finally the Gestell -- you have now
the Essence of the Matrix.  For more information, enroll in the nearest
philosophy department.
