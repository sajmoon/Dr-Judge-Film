1999_April 11 

Without a doubt, the presentation of this film with its myriad of
computerized special effects is spectacular.
It's a feast for the eye. A fantastic journey -- though mostly in tones of
dark colors -- for the very computer literate.
It works very well as a comic book style storytelling in the company of
Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe
Pantoliano. From the pen and direction of the Wachowski brothers, Andy and
Larry (sharply delivered the previous intriguing &quot;Bound&quot; with Jennifer
Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano.) &quot;The Matrix&quot; is imaginative. It's
fantasy, yet the undertones can be real.<br /><br />We've had films with similar storyline, Terry Gilliam has two prominent
ones: &quot;Brazil&quot; 1985 and &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; 1995 -- more concentrated on the plot
and message vs. dazzling computerized effects, hence more time in deeper
delivery of the acting performances along with the story intrigue. Also
comes to mind is Alex Proyas' &quot;Dark City&quot; 1998, especially when we see the
long black trench coats! The virtual reality aspect has traces of &quot;Star
Trek&quot; (the out of body simultaneous existence, the beaming back to the
ship), and of course, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (fighting off the bugs/viruses from the
ship's steering control platform).<br /><br />The chase scenes, action-explosive scenes, and martial art scenes we've
seen/experienced these before. A lot of other film tracks spring to mind:
Barry Sonnenfeld's &quot;Men In Black&quot; 1997 (chases and alien monsters);
Stephen
Norrington's &quot;Blade&quot; 1998 (cool martial art movements); John Badham's
&quot;Blue
Thunder&quot; 1983 (helicopter in action); John McTiernan's &quot;Die Hard&quot; 1988
(the
shattering glass by non-stop flying bullets); and John Woo's trademark
rain
of bullet ballet styles. The computer-intensive plot has a trace of the
situation in &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; 1998 with Bruce Willis; reminders of the
insightful paranoiac B/W independent film of Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Pi&quot; 1998;
yes, Keanu in &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; 1995 -- Is this part 2? Keanu's character
here is a human with doubts and feelings of his own vs. a go-between
android
type. (Ah, &quot;Android&quot; 1982, directed by Aaron Lipstadt is an interesting
sci-fi piece with Klaus Kinski as an avid scientist, and Don Opper who
plays
Max 404 co-wrote the screenplay.)<br /><br />There are steady quiet moments/brief scenes for pause and emotional exchanges, especially the meeting with Oracle, seemingly a surreal scene yet so down-to-earth with human warmth -- for a moment I felt we're in a calm reality with no hurriedness or impending threat. There's also the scene when Morpheus explains to Neo What Is the Matrix -- come to think of it, kinda have tones of George Lucas' 1970 classic &quot;THX 1138&quot; bland background -- esoterically surreal? Jean-Luc Godard's &quot;Alphaville&quot; 1965 is a cool French sci-fi fantasy in B/W with no particular special effects but great story that is familiar.<br /><br />The idea of the bureaucratic society in The Matrix reminds me of John Carpenter's &quot;They Live&quot; 1988.<br /><br />By the way, Hugo Weaving has worn dark
shades before in another movie: Jocelyn Moorehouse's &quot;Proof&quot; 1991 -- he
portrayed a blind photographer (no kidding) with Russell Crowe (who was
the
robotic nightmare SID 6.7 in &quot;Virtuosity&quot; 1995 opposite Denzel
Washington.)<br /><br />Performances are fine all round: Laurence Fishburne always dependable
delivery, Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is as good as it gets, Carrie-Anne
Moss
is cool moves, and Keanu, his was a decent delivery -- can't ask for more,
his presence IS the center of The Matrix. Liquefaction chrome effect is
maximized manifold since its introduction in James Cameron's &quot;The Abyss&quot;
1989. All in all, the Wachowski brothers and co. delivered &quot;The Matrix&quot;
successfully as an opening weekend box office #1 hit. Warner Brothers
should
be all smiles!<br /><br />Keanu did a pretty good job in Taylor Hackford's &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;
1997, opposite Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. To see him in a more
romantic
role and hear him sing with Anthony Quinn, try (&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;
1993 director) Alfonso Arau's &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; 1995.
