1999_August 17 

I just have to say that the special effects in this film are incredible. 
The one thing that made this film so cool is that they took slow motion to
the extreme and you saw bullets flying throught the air, but the camera
still seemed to move or rotate around the subject at a regular speed.  They
did this with not one, but many dozens of cameras.  Because each frame was
from a stationary camera, there was no blurring.  Anyway, if you haven't
seen this film then rent it when it comes out, but you really had to have
seen it widescreen, in a theater, to get the whole heartpounding effect.  As
for the people who didn't like it...
