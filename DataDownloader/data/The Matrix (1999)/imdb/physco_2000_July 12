Absoultly fabulous movie.  It seriously makes you think about your world and
who you are.  The most chilling thing about the movie to me, is that I've
been thinking of a concept like this since i learned what dreaming is.  I've
always had an idea or a feeling that we aren't who we think we are.  Maybe
we are just somebody's dream world  and we know it but we don't want to
become reality.  Who is really watcing over us.  As for neo's idea of fate I
have my own spin on it.  neo Belives that there is no fate, because he
doesn't like the idea of his entire life being planned out for him and he
has no control.  My idea of fate, is that there is one made for you but you
can choose to take the path and be a good little pawn or you can take the
other path and  see how far you can run befor there is a new fate made for
you.  Personally me,  I'm running the life out of me and that's why i don't
run in PE class.  I need to get away from fate, befor fate gets to
me.
