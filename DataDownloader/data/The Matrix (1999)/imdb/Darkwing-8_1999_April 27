1999_April 27 

Everyone has basically said all the good stuff about this film already and
I
agree totally with them.  I don't know what's wrong with some of the
people
who say the plot's too &quot;confusing&quot; to understand as I enjoyed it very
much.
The action scenes literally blew me away and fitted right into the whole
story line.  Virtually everything was good about this film.  But enough
talking... GO OUT AND SEE THIS WICKED MOVIE!!<br /><br />You'll be sorry if you don't!
