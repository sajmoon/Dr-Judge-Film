1999_April 18 

With the coming of technology,it was just a matter of time that the
cinematic experience would change.The very good use of slow motion and
suspended in time view, put The Matrix in the leading edge of the new
techno-cinema. Because the script moves sometime as slowly as paint
drying,this movie is kept from being a great one. But for me as well as
many
thousands, this atmospheric film is a joy for the vision a movie should
be,
but don't miss any line because you are going to need help to catch
up.Welcome back Keanu.
