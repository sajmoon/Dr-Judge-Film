1999_April 27 

I'm one of those rare women who only like to go to the theater if
there's
good science fiction action in the movie. I liked The Matrix . The
graphics
were great, the acting pretty good. Even the story line makes you think
about our lives, no matter how far fetched the story is.  I just have one
question. If you had a choice, wouldn't you rather stay asleep? I
would.
