1999_April 3 

Basically this is a western (most action movies are) in sci-fi land--nothing
new here.  Visually the movie is a cross between Pi and 7 Monkeys.  But all
the visual technology never goes beyond window dressing.  The plot is, at
best, confusing.  The dialogue ranges from stupid to insulting.  This is
about as far below typical film fare as their Bound was above.  Not a total
loss, they do show their considerable talent at creating
tension.
