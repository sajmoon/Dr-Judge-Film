Keanu Reeves in a sci-fi movie?  Remember Johnny Mnemonic?
Thankfully it didn't put Reeves off of starring in the Wachowski brothers
trip into Wonderland.  Breath taking special effects and a hip soundtrack. 
The list of pros for this movie could go on and on.
I can't believe there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie yet
who intends to but if so then quit reading this and rent the DVD.  Even
better, get to a late show of it.  This film has to be seen on a big screen
to be fully appreciated!
