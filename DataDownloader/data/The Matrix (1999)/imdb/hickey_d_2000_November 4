This is a must see for anyone...it's one of the top 250 films, and I am not
surprised. Keanu Reeves does a great job in playing Mr. Anderson / Neo. This
movie also has the best special effects I have seen in a long
time!<br /><br />The Matrix is a world that is controlled by Agents. Neo, along with a few
others, are in the real world, and they want to break free the people in the
other world. What is going to happen? You'll just have to find out! I'll be
very excited when Matrix 2 and 3 come out!
