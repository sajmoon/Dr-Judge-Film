<br /><br /> The heroes are much like the protagonists of STAR WARS.<br /><br /> The villains are much like STAR TREK's borg.<br /><br /> The wardrobe is a rip-off of T2 and BLADE, for the heroes, and MIB for the
bad guys.<br /><br /> The gunfights are Hong-Kong inspired. So are the fight
scenes.<br /><br /> Those are only a few of the influences I've spotted.<br /><br /> This movie did not reinvent the wheel, but it's still gives the movie goer
quite an eyeful and does what it's supposed to, which is to entertain. All
the stories have been told, it's all in the &quot;how&quot; you tell the story. This
one had a cool style and some innovative special effects. I won't say this
is my favorite movie ever, but it was worth watching.
