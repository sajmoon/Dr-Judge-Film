1999_October 31 

is what Keanu Reeves says in the movie (and in the trailer) and it's
EXACTLY
what I said after watching it, as will you.  This movie exceeded my
expectations, probably because I thought it was going to be some lame,
action sci-fi with an overused plot.  This movie makes you think, but it
waves enough action, visual effects and pretty faces in your face to keep
you entertained as well.  once again, I gotta say it...whoa.
