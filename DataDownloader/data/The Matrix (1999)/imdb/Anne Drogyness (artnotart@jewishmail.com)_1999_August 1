1999_August 1 

I hadn't been to the movie theater in a while.  Someone had told me that
this new movie, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, had the best cinematography EVER.  Actually,
quite a few people had told me that.  Curious what all of this business was
about, I saw _The Matrix_.<br /><br />It was okay.  I'm not a big action movie person, so that was strike one
for me.  The idea was pretty cool, and it was executed pretty well.  But I'd
be lying if I told you that I thought it had the &quot;greatest cinematography
EVER&quot; or any other such comment.  The Matrix was a pretty good movie, but
not a big deal.<br /><br />The movie follows this character 'Neo' (Keanu Reeves), who is a 'hacker'
that we are told is 'the one'.  The whole future rests on the events that
take place in this two and a half hour movie!  aggh!  There is a side love
story that is not really touched on that much until the end.  There is a
group of underground 'resistence members' who know the answer to the
question &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; and Neo finds himself alongside them.  Don't
look for any of the other characters in 'the resistence' to really have any
depth, because they don't really figure into the story.<br /><br />The movie has lots of sleek, neato mosquito special effects and computer
animation (if you are into that sort of thing), and the acting is okay for
the characters that have more than three lines.  There are a few stupid
lines that really don't need to be in the movie and are really present just
to make certain characters look more badass.  Any more information and I'd
have to answer the question &quot;What is the Matrix&quot;, which means giving away
the movie.  It was alright, I guess I'm glad I saw it.<br /><br />By the way, i am led to believe that the &quot;cinematography&quot; in this movie is
so wonderful because of the fighting scenes.  If that is the case, please go
rent any of the early Jackie Chan movies instead of this, because the action
in those movies is done quite well, without the benefit of big-budget
Hollywood effects.
