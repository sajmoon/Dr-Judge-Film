The Matrix is the greatest sci-fi movie since &quot;Star Wars&quot; and will
revolutionize all sci-fi movies to come out of the screen. The Matrix
defines sci-fi, and should be on everyone's top 10. If you haven't seen The
Matrix yet you have no idea what you've been missing. Right now this movie
is #36 on the 250 list for a reason. The action, the special effects is
magnificent , everyone would say &quot;cool&quot;! If I could I would give this movie
6 stars. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie and it could be yours!
