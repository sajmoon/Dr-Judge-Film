Yes, I thought it was a fun movie, because it just takes you on a mad roller
coaster-like adventure through the real-unreal world of the Matrix. And all
kinds of cool high-tech stuff happens, and lots of stuff gets blown up, and
&quot;faster than a speeding bullet&quot; is a relative concept in this twisted
time-space-reality continuum. <br /><br />I personally am not a big science fiction fan, (either in books or in film)
because typically I just don't &quot;get it&quot; as far as what the heck they are
really talking about (I guess I need more approachable subject matter). But
I actually liked Matrix, it has enough high-tech action stuff happening, and
enough vague, mysterious tension going on to keep me suitably riveted to the
tube.<br /><br />That being said, I think this movie should be remade as a comedy. I recently
saw &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and in that movie I was amazed at how well comedy works in a
futuristic, sci-fi setting. <br /><br />I thought many of the dialogue lines in Matrix were downright corny (sorry,
I forgot to write down a sampling...), and there were times where I couldn't
help but mentally rewrite certain scenes to be redone as twisted comedy.
Like, when Keanu's character goes to meet the Oracle, what if the Oracle
turned out to be... Larry Ellison!! (or Ross Perot, or Alice Cooper, or
Madonna... heck, be creative, pick your own favorite but offbeat &quot;Oracle&quot;
character to appear here). And when Neo is having that gunfight showdown
with the Agent, it could have been rewritten to have him crazily jumping all
around and bouncing off walls to avoid the bullets, kind of like Jim
Carrey's character did in The Mask.<br /><br />Finally, let me say that I actually admire Keanu Reeves, and his performance
in this movie is quite good (IMHO). Some people think he is too wooden,
whereas I liken his style more to a quiet intensity ala Clint Eastwood. I
must admit, that it was years before I got around to &quot;liking&quot; Clint
Eastwood. In his early spaghetti western movies, in the Dirty Harry series,
heck, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then, one day I watched
&quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; and it was truly an epiphany. Not only did that
excellent movie make me a believer in Clint Eastwood, but it rekindled an
interest in westerns, and actually made me want to go re-watch many of the
great westerns, including some of the earlier ones with Clint Eastwood, that
I had heretofore dismissed.<br /><br />In short, &quot;Matrix&quot;: not such a bad movie at all, Keanu Reeves is more
intense than you may realize, and go see &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and &quot;The Outlaw Josey
Wales&quot;.
