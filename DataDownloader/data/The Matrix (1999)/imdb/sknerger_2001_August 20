This is, as most people who have seen it would agree, a good movie.
Although
I must admit that it is not one of my all time favourites, as I don't have
a
nagging desire to watch it again any time soon. I guess this is because you
really don't have to watch it more than once to know that it is a good and
entertaining film, unless you are an incredibly big fan of the movie and
can't seem to get enough of it, which seems to be a common case for many.<br /><br />I believe &quot;The Matrix&quot; to be a brilliantly creative and interesting movie
with a good combination of superlative special effects and spine-tingling
action. I also believe that this film deserves the numerous acclamations it
received for it's amazingly different storyline, and nobody can possibly
dispute this fact.<br /><br />I thought that the camera work for this film was wonderful, and I share the
opinion with almost everyone else that the special effects were mind
blowing. However, I think I prefer other sci-fi movies like &quot;Star Wars&quot;,
although I know that they are not really that similar to each other ,
though
are categorised in the same genre.<br /><br />I would like to conclude this comment by saying, as an aspiring film maker,
that the Wachowski Brothers are extraordinary film writers with very
admirable imaginations. I know, for a fact, that I couldn't possibly write
anything so creative, but give me a couple of years. I am only
14!
