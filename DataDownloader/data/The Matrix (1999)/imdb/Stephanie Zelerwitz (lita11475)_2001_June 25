&quot;Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it
for yourself.&quot;
-Morpheus (In the Matrix)<br /><br />He was right all along. To those of you who have seen The Matrix, I'm sure
you understand what I mean. To those of you who have not, let me urge you
to
go see this unique, brilliant, amazing movie as soon as you can. It is not
all action, it is not the kind of movie that can be in the background. It
is
a thief, it steals your attention away from anything else to the last
moment. It is not the kind of movie you can stop, and continue later.
When,
at last, you watch the final captivating moments of the thriller, you will
want to run it back and watch it all over again. The characters feel real,
and before the movie's even over, you feel like you could walk outside and
see one of them. The Matrix is in no way like any other movie that I have
ever seen. The plot was original and intelligent. It is extremely
unpredictable, and will have your heart racing. I urge everyone to see it.
But, remember, it is not a movie you watch, it is a movie you experience.
Enjoy!
