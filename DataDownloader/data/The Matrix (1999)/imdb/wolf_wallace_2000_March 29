The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and
sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still
photography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the
screen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by
filmmakers for a number of years. Acting was wonderful, script, visual,
sound, everything about this film is a tribute to a usually overlooked
genre.
