1999_April 6 

While not your normal movie, The Matrix provides a very fascinating look at
another futuristic standpoint. The movie provides an excellent cast, a very
well structured and creative story, and directing that spans past a standard
filmmaking process. I'm not a big fan of action movies in that lack of story
to give us more gunshot scenes and explosions kind of way. The Matrix,
however, is action, gunshot scenes, and explosions movie in a different kind
of way. This is not the normal action movie shootout scenes, no pointless or
horrendously oversized explosions, no cheesy lines or bored two-dimensional
characters. This movie is truly an excellent idea that didn't suffer
cutbacks or cliche events to score a quick profit. One of the things I liked
about this movie was the complexity of the story line. This isn't a movie
that spoon feeds you the information your brain requires to understand
what's going on. You do have to think, and that's one thing I liked about
it. The movie starts out fast, and ends with goose bumps. This is a movie
that wets your appetite for more and satisfies your cravings until you're
completely infatuated by its composure. A excellent movie that will stick
with you for some time to come. I can't wait for the sequel.
