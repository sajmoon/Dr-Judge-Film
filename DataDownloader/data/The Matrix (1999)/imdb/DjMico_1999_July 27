This is really strange stuff. Not at all blockbuster material, one might
think, but it works. On many levels. The story deals with a man awakened
from the dream that is life on earth. Our existence is an illusion,
generated by an elaborate computer program known as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Planet
earth is instead ruled by vicious, man-like aliens, intent on eliminating
all those who know the truth.  <br /><br />The dark, moody comic-book feel really challenges your imagination. It is
recommended that you keep a VERY open mind while watching this film, as the
story gets pretty flipped-out from time to time. I found certain parts of it
hard to swallow, yet bits and pieces of &quot;Matrix&quot; are truly brilliant. There
are quite a few impressive fight sequences, some breathtaking and
ground-breaking visual effects and a shootout scene that should be scribbled
down in the record books. The message of the film is crystal clear and very
ironic in these computerized times - mankind is a virus, a disease that can,
should and will be cured by someone who knows better. Style AND substance,
folks. The way it should be.<br /><br />The storyline is occasionally confusing and Keanu Reeves' acting abilities
leaves a lot to be wished for, but those are minor gripes. &quot;Matrix&quot; delivers
the goodies and the soundtrack is really cool. I recommend it, but not for
the Schwarzenegger-crowd. This film forces you to think and participate, to
probe and search for the truth alongside the characters. Not all visits to
the movie theater turn out that fruitful. <br /><br />If our existence really is controlled by a computer program, I sure hope
&quot;The Matrix&quot; is it. The Microsoft phenomena is frightening enough as it is,
but to see Bill Gates in shades and a black suit after viewing this film
would be enough to give anyone goose-bumps.
