I'm probably going to get lynched for saying this but...<br /><br />*hides and whispers* It's really not THAT good.<br /><br />It is an entertaining film. It is very good for passing a couple of hours
and for dissecting with friends afterwards. It is a film that was made for
video nights for that purpose. I'm not saying I don't like it, I do. But I
do not think it is a masterpiece. I do not find the secrets of the universe
contained herein - but that is probably because I am not a conspiracy
theorist and hence that level of the film is just daft to me. Indeed I think
it would have been a lot better had they just made a good old fashioned
adventure story with a cyber twist rather than making it a theological
debate.<br /><br />At a technical level it is absolutely amazing and that is the key to the
success of the film. If it did not have the technical stunts and gimmickery
then the reaction to it would be a lot more muted and probably more
realistic. It is no accident that the people I know who have praised it most
highly are cyberpunk fans! Other friends have been a lot cooler about
it.<br /><br />On the other hand it does have Keanu in leather and for that I can forgive
much!
