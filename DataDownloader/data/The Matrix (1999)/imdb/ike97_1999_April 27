Once in a while, an SF movie comes along that is so beautifully crafted
and
conceived that it sets the mark against which others are judged. Star Wars
was one such movie. And I believe the Matrix is another.<br /><br />The special effects blew me away. And it's got all the elements that makes
it a superbly enjoyable movie: action, a hero everyone wants to identify
with, and romance.<br /><br />This one's going to be a classic.
