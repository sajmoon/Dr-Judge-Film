&quot;The Matrix&quot; is definitely a film of epic proportions. With<br /><br />great, eye-popping special effects, splendidly cheographed gun<br /><br />fights that would make John Woo blush, and larger-than-life<br /><br />performances by the stars. When this movie first came out in mid<br /><br />'99, &quot;Star Wars: the Phantom Menace&quot; was still wowing many<br /><br />movie-goers. But &quot;The Matrix&quot; gave viewers a whole new ride, one<br /><br />that made &quot;Star Wars&quot; look pitifully weak, and well....
DEAD!<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, AKA Neo, a mild-mannered<br /><br />businessman/computer hacker, who is given the shock of his life<br /><br />when he discovers that he is chosen by an elite team of<br /><br />physically and mentally enhanced individuals, led by a<br /><br />mysterious guru named Morpheus (played by the mystifying<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne). This team shows Neo the world of the<br /><br />Matrix, which is basically the real world, which our world is<br /><br />basically false. Everything in the real world is in shambles<br /><br />because of the fact that machines have taken order. Neo<br /><br />reluctantly agrees to take part in rebelling against the<br /><br />machines, battling against the agents, evil folks who mastered<br /><br />the Matrix's powers who despise the rebels.<br /><br />Other than the fact that the effects in this movie are dynamic,<br /><br />the inspirations and philosophy behind &quot;The Matrix&quot; is also<br /><br />compelling. This movie had borrowed many ideas and concepts from<br /><br />other movies, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; (the idea of using an inner<br /><br />force within), &quot;The Terminator&quot; (the idea of man against<br /><br />machine), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (breaking away from society), and &quot;Men in<br /><br />Black&quot; (the wearing of Rayban sunglasses and the idea of joining<br /><br />an elite cult and not going back to regular life). <br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is most probably the kind of movie that will become<br /><br />a true landmark in the history of cinema; the kind that will be<br /><br />a major influence to many other films to come, as did &quot;Star<br /><br />Wars&quot; and &quot;The Terminator.&quot; This movie practically won many<br /><br />Oscar awards for effects and sound, I'm pretty surprised it<br /><br />didn't win anything for performances. And what did &quot;The Phantom<br /><br />Menace&quot; win? Practically nothing! Sorry, Mr. Lucas, sometimes<br /><br />the competition can be EXTREMELY powerfull! &quot;
