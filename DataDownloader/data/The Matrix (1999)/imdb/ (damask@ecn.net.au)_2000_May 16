The Matrix must be one of the most astounding movies I have ever
seen!
Pity I missed it at the cinema, but at least with the vid I could stop,
rewind, and get it EXACTLY right!
I don't go in for idolising actors; I'd rather I didn't know who they
&quot;really&quot; were! Sure Keanu Reeves is spunky: so what?! He is great in this
movie, which is more to the point.<br /><br />I have not noticed this point made by any commenter yet, but to my mind
this
movie is based HEAVILY on Gnostic thought. I actually concluded that it
was
a lesson using the medium of cinema and the language of current Pop
culture
to deliver some profoundly thought-provoking teachings about the nature of
Reality and how we perceive it.<br /><br />The Gnostics are claiming it as a pop-statement of their beliefs. The
Buddhists are doing the same.
I think they are both correct!<br /><br />LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!....... and YES! (check some Gnostic
thought),and see it
again!
