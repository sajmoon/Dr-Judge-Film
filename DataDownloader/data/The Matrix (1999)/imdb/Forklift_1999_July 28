<br /><br />The matrix makes me think to the matrices that I studied in maths that I
always enjoy.  The first thing that attracted me to the movie was that the
word &quot;Matrix&quot; was already used in one Doctor Who Episode: Trial of the
timelords which I enjoyed too.<br /><br />But let's stick the comments to the movie.  It features Keanu Reeves a well
known actor and Laurence Fishburne which I first saw him in Event Horizon. <br /><br />The story is well done, good plot, as in many US Hollywood movies, they
always try to tell people everything in details.<br /><br />The second thing is: Why do rebels always need to look cool(refering to
their black clothing except for Oracle)?<br /><br />The third thing: It made me thought too much to Dark City which I saw months
ago.<br /><br />those are the only reasons why I rate it only 9 out of
10.<br /><br />This is a film that will dazzle, amaze, disturb &amp; even confuse the
viewers.<br /><br />Good entertainment.<br /><br />
