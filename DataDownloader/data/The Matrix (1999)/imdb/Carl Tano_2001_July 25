Ooohh! This movie is slightly above the average, just kidding. It's much
better than your normal sci-fi/action-movie. The action scenes are greater
and more well-made than anything that at least I've seen before. The story
of the movie and the feeling of the movie is also something special. The
movie has a strange kind of feeling which allows even a normal conversation
to get your adrenaline going. The movie is straight phenomenal. It surpasses
2 hrs but the 2 hours feel like 15 minutes because the tempo of the movie is
so fast.<br /><br />The acting is also superior in it compared to any other action movie. The
cast including superstars like Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves also has
a solid set of great actors in supporting roles.  This must be the most
well-made, most thought-out action/sci-fi movie ever and I'm surprised this
wasn't nominated for best movie during the oscars, since it is so
entertaining and every second of it is an experience not to be
missed.
