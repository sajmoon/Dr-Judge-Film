1999_June 29 

I am totally biased towards this movie because it makes you think
about
if what we believe is true or not. I enjoy movies that tease the brain,
and
not the flesh. The Matrix is definitely that. You have to look at the
movie
from a technological view in order to enjoy it. The special effects
were
awesome, and I appreciated the fact that the language was not that
bad.
No, the plot was not one that I expected, but the action made up for that.
I
do not recommend this movie for children under 18 - their minds
probably
won't grasp it - but I do recommend it to adults who like to see movies
that
are out of the ordinary. I am waiting for it to come out on videotape/DVD
so
I can hear it through my surround sound system.
I enjoyed this movie.
