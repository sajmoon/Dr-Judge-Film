1999_April 27 

I was quite surprised when I finally sat down to see the Matirx.  Like most
of you who saw it in its first week running, I had no Idea about the plot
and just assumed it would be a good Special Effects Movie.  Man, was I
totally wrong.  After about 20 minutes into the movie you are asking
yourself &quot;Hey, is Keanu Reeves really acting this well?&quot;.  I sat and stared
in awe, at the screen, the plot was deep, the story had meaning, and Keanu
actually put serious effort into this one.  He didn't seem like the normal
Wooden Soldier... and Laurence Fishburne, man he is totally under
appreciated, he played a heck of a part.  All in all, one hell of a movie, I
give it a 8.  Most Def. with going to see, and don't make the mistake of
waiting till home video, this one has to be seen in the theaters, and make
it a Sony digital theater.
