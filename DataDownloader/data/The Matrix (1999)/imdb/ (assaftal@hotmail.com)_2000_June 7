2000_June 7 

The excellent special effects and careful thought given to
all
of the visual aspects of this movie could have made it outstanding was it
not for its plot. Does anybody expect me to believe robots use human
beings
as batteries? How stupid am I supposed to be? The plot itself is fitting
perhaps of some old 40's pulp science fiction magazine . . . no
respectable
SF writer would ever dare to publish such a story. If you want to read
about
reality, I suggest reading Philip K. Dick's novels.
There are also numerous &quot;deus-ex-machine&quot; scenes - things which are
suddenly
brought up simply to advance the plot and then dismissed without any
explanation, such as the bogus visit to the oracle . . . who was she
supposed to be? Where did she come from? Beats me.
If that's not enough, add Reeve's acting - there is one
scene
which made me laugh, the one where Morpheus explains to
him
the nature of the matrix and he starts yelling 'no, get
me
out of here!'.
This movie might be worthwhile seeing, but rating it as
one
the best films ever? This gives me the creeps. That's like
rating Harry Potter as one of the best books of all times.
For God's sake, get an education and study your human heritage.<br /><br />
