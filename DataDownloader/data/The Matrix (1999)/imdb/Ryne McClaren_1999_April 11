The Matrix is stunningly well executed via great direction and flair.  Not a
movie of great substance, although it does give you some food for thought
when you leave.  Definitely a perfect ten when it comes to the good old
Sci-Fi look and feel.  The Matrix (with its visuals and effects) shall do
for science fiction movies of the next millennium what Blade Runner and
Alien did for Sci-Fi of the '80's and 90's.
