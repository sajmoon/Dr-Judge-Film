the matrix is amazing. i like sci-fi films and this one is really
outstanding. the story line is new to me and it is very thought provoking
although there are some vague areas which you just have to ignore so you can
enjoy the story as 'whole'.
keanu, laurence and carrie-anne did a great job on this film. carrie-anne
is great! she looked stunning and dangerous which made her a very strong
character in the film. while keanu and lauren did equally
well.
i understand that the matrix is based on a comic strip and this could be
the reason why the script is very delightful. there're lots of good plots in
the comic industry that need to be seriously looked upon.
the visual and sound effects are great and the action sequences are
amazing. the stunts are also well executed and graceful although at times
very violent. the dojo' scenes are cool.
this is  a must see for the sci-fi and effects fanatics out there. this is
one great film.
