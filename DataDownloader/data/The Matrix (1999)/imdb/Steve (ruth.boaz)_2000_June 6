Most of the reviews have already told you the basics; great special effects
and stunts, intriguing plot, plenty of action.  All true.  However, let me
weigh in with this.  Every great action movie needs a great villain.  The
Matrix gives us the greatest villain since Die Hard's Hans Gruber -- Agent
Smith.  Here is an enemy you can love to hate and yet he is so interesting
you really enjoy his scenes.  His monologues will make you want to see this
movie again and again just as much as the special effects.
