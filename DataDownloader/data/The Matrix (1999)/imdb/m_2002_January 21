The Matrix is an outstanding visual entertainment.
However, its plot is quite buggy (scenarists are confused between Watts and
Volts, Agents may &quot;teleport&quot; and &quot;track&quot; anybody but need to bug Neo to
follow him...) and not that original (Stanislas Lem's Futurology Congress,
Total Recall, Ghosts in the Shell...) so, well, The Matrix can't be enjoyed
more than twice because after that, it will lose its appeal...
What a pity...
