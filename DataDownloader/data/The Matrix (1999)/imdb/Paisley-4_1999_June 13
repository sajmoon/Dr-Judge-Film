For whoever put together the trailer - good job. It showed enough to
intrigue while revealing little.<br /><br />To everyone involved in the creation of this film - thank you. Thank you
for
not aiming for the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; audience. I have rarely been
this impressed with the art of movie-making.<br /><br />To Mr. Reeves, kudos for a strong performance. NEO's quiet depression (near
suicidal, I thought) in the early scenes are affective without being
obvious. The subtle nuances are fascinating - during NEO's boss' lecture
(one can see suspicion of his surroundings even then) and also when being
interrogated by the AGENTS. Particularly satisfying is the reaction to
being
exposed to a horrific reality, and the wondrous serenity at the moment when
NEO finally, truly, believes. As for the physical training, it paid off;
the
fight sequences look fabulous.<br /><br />I wanted entertainment - I got it in a big way.
