1999_April 11 

Although the first hour was rather boring, the following hour of the movie
was action packed, it makes up for all the action (or lack of) in the
first
part. This is a top movie. Great special effects, and great cast, make
this
movie a must see.<br /><br />Great if you love Sci-Fi movies, I do. 10/10 from me.
