1999_May 21 

I was about 12 the last time I left a theatre and wanted to go back in and
watch the same movie again, right then and there...until The Matrix.
Non-stop plot progression (character introductions last about 5 seconds)
coupled with some of the best fight sequences I've come across and almost
seamless special effects combine to make this an intense,
thought-provoking
movie. Morpheus' &quot;born into bondage&quot; monologue strikes disturbing bells
even
without the matrix. Creditable performances from all the main characters,
an
internally consistent plot and, unusually, science that didn't make me
want
to throw up in disgust made my suspension of disbelief not just willing
but
unnoticeable. Sets, costumes, lighting, cinematography (I loved the
&quot;freeze
the frame yet rotate the camera around the main subject&quot; technique and
thought it could have been used once or twice more); everything hangs
together beautifully to create an often dark and oppressive atmosphere
which
perfectly complements the story.
