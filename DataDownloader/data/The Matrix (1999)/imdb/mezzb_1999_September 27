1999_September 27 

The hype from this movie was huge.  From its surprisingly huge box office to
internet fan sites, to constant gushing by friends and relatives, I thought
this was a can't-miss.  <br /><br />For me, it missed.<br /><br />1. They give away the essential secret/premise very early on (there are
other revelations of course, but the whole matrix thing gets exposed very
early).  I thought it would've worked better to keep it mysterious to bouy
the next complaint.<br /><br />2. It dragged in the middle.  Big time.  Practically nothing happens.  no
tension.   nothing.  A bunch of dialog explaining &quot;the rules&quot;.  If they held
onto the mystery a little longer, that could have kept this dead part a bit
more interesting.  During this 70 minute dead spot, all I could think of was
how I had to go to the bathroom.<br /><br />3. Even with all that explaining, it still gets a little confusing, and
there were many questions to be asked of the writer, along the lines of &quot;Why
didn't they just &lt;insert more logical action here&gt; instead of
&lt;doing what they actually did&gt;?&quot;  The answer was &quot;To serve the story,
not logic.&quot;<br /><br />4. The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really rock.  I think this explains
why so many are ga-ga over this film.  It just rips out of its sleepy middle
and smokes right through to the credits.  I (and many others) liked Episode
One for the same reason - it leaves you breathless, forgetting that most of
the movie was pretty tired.<br /><br />But the difference between ep one and this (and why I liked ep one better)
is they broke up the middle with a pod race.  Here there's nothing like
that.
