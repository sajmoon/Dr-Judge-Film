I'm surprised that this movie has been ranked so high on the All Time Top
250.  While I enjoyed the movie and consider the plot quite original, I
certainly don't think it deserves to be rated the 33rd best movie of all
time.  In fact, based on a scale for measuring movie quality, I would
place
&quot;The Matrix&quot; closer to &quot;Twister&quot; than &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  Again, it isn't
that
I disliked the movie but let's be real.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is nothing more than
a
very original and well done action movie.
