There you have, when Keanu was running out of characters, he turned on the
blender and &quot;zooop&quot;, instant sci-fi high-tech thriller with some 'deja vu'.
Visually astonishing as any sci-fi mainstream movie today, a half of the
movie trying to explain us (and Keanu) what's this all about: this is not
the real world. Well, if i have to choose...
Shades of Woo style on the gun-to-gun and all the firing-gun scenes, shades
of the Kung Fu series, the usually great Fishburne and the f/x feast and the
promise of a sequel. A new hero for next milennium. We all can be the
messiah by having a comfortable pc plugged to a telephone line. Cinema?
That's another story.
