In the classic tradition of earlier sci-fi greats such as Soylent Green,
Planet Of The Apes, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and others, The Matrix has a
frightening social dilemma wrapped up tight in a nice little &quot;what if&quot;
scenario that takes us one step further into this virtual reality thing.
It's a scary thing, this future world, and it houses a very frightening
monster that is man-made. That's right; we've done it to ourselves once
again.
We've created another 'Frankenstein,' only it's computer generated,
robotic,
and can think for itself. Sometime in the future machines become
intelligent
enough to create original thought. And, since these future super-computers
can think millions of times faster than humans, we aren't even aware of the
'revolt.' Much later, a small group of rebels frees Keanu Reeves' character
from this mind-controlling situation, and this is where the story of The
Matrix begins.<br /><br />
