&quot;The Matrix&quot;, asks the question &quot;What is real?&quot;. More than that, though,
it
asks &quot;Would you rather live in a comfortable lie or a harsh truth?&quot;. This
is
a great movie with an intriguing plot. The special effects combined with
the
characters/cast provide an action-packed movie that has something for
everyone. However, some characters are introduced as important, but are
not
fully developed by the end of the movie, leaving you saying &quot;What
about...?&quot;. For example, the character Switch a very intriguing character
for what we saw of her, but her character was not fully explored. Also,
the
ending would have been better if it had gone a little bit further into the
story than it did. It almost ends too soon, without fully satisfying the
audiences expectations. All in all it was an excellent movie. I recommend
it
to anyone who's stomach can handle the gory scenes.
