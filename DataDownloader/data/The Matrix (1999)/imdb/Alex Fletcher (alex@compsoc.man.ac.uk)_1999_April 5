1999_April 5 

This film is brilliant. The pace is fast, the visuals are simply stunning,
but most of all the set piece action sequences just took my breath
away.<br /><br />There is lots of homage to all the great action directors: the plot is
basically Terminator, there is much use of John Woo's 2 guns crossed over,
the shootout scene is reminiscent of Heat and the whole design concept is
somewhere between the 5th Element and Brazil. But don't be fooled into
thinking this is just a rip off: the Wachowski's are clearly influenced
and
pay tribute to these directors, but have a very individual style of their
own.<br /><br />And everyone wears sunglasses! ALL THE TIME!!!<br /><br />Stop reading right now and get yourselves down to the local cinema to see
this masterpiece.
