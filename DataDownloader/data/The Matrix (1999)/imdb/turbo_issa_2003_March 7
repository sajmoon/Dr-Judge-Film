<br /><br />The matrix is a stunning visual display of effects so unique that they are
being used in advertisements, games and even in televisions series. But this
movie offcourse has more to offer than just special effects. A movie cannot
survive on that alone. There are great martial arts sequences that all the
actors do, a great sense of style that the matrix has begun.<br /><br />Carrie-Anne Moss in my opinion steals the show in this movie. She has this
silent aggression and strength yet still being a woman. There are very few
ladies who can act greatly in fantasy movies. She is right up there with the
ladies from the lord of the rings trilogy.<br /><br />Of course the rest of the cast were wonderful. I love Hugo Weaving! What a
ledged he is. He is wonderful in the lord of the rings trilogy and he is
FANSTASIC in this movie. He definitely has become one of my favourite
actors. I was so sad when the crew dies. I wanted to punch
cipher.<br /><br />I thought to post my thoughts on the movie before the second and third come
out this year. In Australia we have a month before number two comes
out.<br /><br />The only thing that I did not like about this movie was the word &#145;Zion'.
That is pure propaganda in my opinion. Are they trying to advertise Zionism?
I am very disgusted at that. Offcourse one must really look into the movie,
and I admit I am very observant when I watch movies. If number two becomes a
racist movie towards certain groups [I shall not name names at this point,
though I will if my theory is confirmed], I should be very much peeved.<br /><br />
