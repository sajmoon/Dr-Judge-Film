If you go into this film with no expectations then this film is visually
THE
BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. Keanu Reeves kicks butt bigtime.<br /><br />However the plot is a bit twisted, I wont spoil it for everyone, but the
matrix is a really creepy idea.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if when you go to the cinema you want to see &quot;goodies&quot;
beating
&quot;baddies&quot; this film won't disappoint.
