1999_April 7 

Having put up with so much drivel at the theatres recently, I sat down in
the plush seats of my neighbourhood theatre not expecting much and I was
pleasantly surprised, to say the least.
The plot/theme is not original but very well here adapted to screen. The
acting is par excellence (for Keanu :) and the fight sequences are
tremendously exciting; moves every little boy wishes he could use to
thwart
bullies the next day at school!
Try as one might, there are very few holes that can be poked in the logic
of
this movie. I hereby award this movie three karate chops out of three and
a half.
