Damn...
The greatest film ever.
Too good for words, really.  Seen it 4 times.  Gonna go see it again this
weekend.  In fact, I had to get rid of a bunch of stuff on my hard drive to
make room for the ENTIRE movie in mpeg format.  1.3 gigs, but well worth it.
I'm still making it a point to see it every weekend at the
theater.
Effects were secondary to the wonderful story that was told superbly.<br /><br />It was quite a ride following the White Rabbit down its
hole...
Holding my breath til the sequel...
