1999_September 18 

This movie really got it all.. well.. almost..
I went to the theatres with none hope of all because i didn't know anything
about the movie.. But it didn't take long before i was caught inside a new
dimension of effects, action, acting and story..<br /><br />The story is very good formulated. This movie would not usually be very easy
to understand. But the writers have in their own way told the complicated
story piece by piece to make YOU understand what is going on. And it is so
damn good.. So remarkable well done that i can't find anything like
it.<br /><br />This story combined with brand new effects and a very stunning set of action
scenes makes THE MATRIX to one of the best movies ever come out. You will
love this movie and it's very unique style. <br /><br />But offcourse! There are some downfalls. <br /><br />But a must for every man and woman on this planet that can breath air! If
there is such a thing as air!!<br /><br />cAPtIVa
