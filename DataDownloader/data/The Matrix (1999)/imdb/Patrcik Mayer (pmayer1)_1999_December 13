I thought that The Matrix was one of the better action movies I have ever
seen.  However, the depth that so many other people see, I do not.  It
seems
like the directors read some philosophy of knowledge, found enough of an
idea to make a movie, and then quit.  The philosophy of this movie misses
the entrie point of epistemology, which doesn't ask if we are in the true
reality, but more what is reality, how do we interact with it, and how do
we
have knowledge of it.
As far as acting, Fishburne was good, as was Weaving, but it seemed that
Reeves and Moss were there so they could be seen in tight
leather.
The special effects are very well done, and I loved the training
sessions.
The directors do a good job of building the action and the
suspence.
Overall a good action movie, but little more.
