1999_July 10 

From the minute the movie started, I saw that there was good planning
behind
the movie.<br /><br />The Movie really had a plot. Not a very complex one, except for some
people.
But it made you think, what if that was real, and all else
not. We just have to find an awakened person.<br /><br />The Camera angles were excellent. They almost always found the optimal
effect or angle to speed up the feeling in the scene. Halfway of the film,
it looked like it was lost, but later on it was rolling again and the show
was really enjoyable. New and amazing. Only one major &quot;annoying&quot; clich&eacute; in
the film though.. And a few smaller ones. Not gonna spoil someone's movie
telling about them. :)<br /><br />Go and see it.. It made me doubt, that should I see Star Wars: E1 after
this
experience.
