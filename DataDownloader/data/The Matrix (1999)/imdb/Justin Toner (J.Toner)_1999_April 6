1999_April 6 

&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the best sci-fi movies i've
seen in awhile, and one of the best movies of 1999 so far.<br /><br />The themes in this movie have been explored in
sci-fi before but I was
impressed that the movie gives it a new twist and a
plot which was pretty sound.<br /><br />The special effects, camera work, and fight sequences
are all incredible and well done. I thought the use of slow motion was
excellent and added alot of neat things to the action. The martial arts
action was some of the best i've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />-Keanu Reeves did a decent job as Neo, much better then
some
of his last couple of movie roles<br /><br />-Laurence Fishburne was very cool as the wise
and experienced Morpheus. A great performance<br /><br />-Carrie-Anne Moss was the person that impressed me
the most, she was excellent as Trinity. She gave a
great performance that made me really like her character.<br /><br />-and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith did a great job as the
main
villian. He gave Smith such a cold, calculating and menacing
look and attitude, he also impressed me.<br /><br />Don't wait too long, go see &quot;The Matrix&quot;
