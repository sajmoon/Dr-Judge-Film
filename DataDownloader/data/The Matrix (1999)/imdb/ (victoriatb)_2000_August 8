Way cool movie.  I saw it two days ago with my best friend.  She<br /><br />was raving it was so neat.  So I watched it.  I discovered, man,<br /><br />was she right!  I liked Switch and Trinity.  Morpheous was<br /><br />pretty cool too.  I've never seen any other Keanu Reaves movies<br /><br />so I can't comment on him.  Definately a find.  Definate
