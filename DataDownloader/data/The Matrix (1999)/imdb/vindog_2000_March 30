2000_March 30 

     One of the true SF classics. This film ironically is
the
first true Internet driven hit yet it reminds us of the
frail
boundary between what is real and what is virtual at the
turn
of the millenium. Intelligent,action packed and true to
the genre Matrix forces us to question how we often have
come to serve technology rather than have it serve us.
As
sobering as 2001 and Farenheit 451 with the ethical questions
embelematic of both of those classics not to mention the
state of the art visual and audio effects.
