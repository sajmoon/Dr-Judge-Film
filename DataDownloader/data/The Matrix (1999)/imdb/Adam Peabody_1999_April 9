1999_April 9 

To begin, I genuinely enjoyed The Matrix. I am typically very cautious
about
mass-released sci-fi, especially starring Keanu. However, knowing the
Wachowskis' work, I was excited. (Also, I know several crew members who
never shut up about it.) I am very satisfied with the finished product.
None
of the special effects are new or revolutionary, but FINALLY they had a
valid reason for being in the film. By integrating special effects with
the
plot, the Wachowskis brought us a solid and fully developed
science-fiction
movie. Go see it. Do it now.
