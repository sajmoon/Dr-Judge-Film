Keanu...surfer dude with a UZI, has come to save the world! THE MATRIX is a
science fiction story about a cyberpunk jesus christ like good guy who
vanquishes the bad guys in a hail of bullets. Actually the concept of a
&quot;reality within a reality&quot; has been done before in films like JACOBS
LADDER....but never with so much gunfire. THE ONE they keep talking about
in
the film comes from Madame Blatvatsky and the Luciferian movement....the
force of STAR WARS was zen buddhism, I'm not bitching mind you I'm just
stating fact. There is a heavy amount of New Age allegory in this movie as
there was in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. I find that sort of thing
interesting.
THE MATRIX is the story of a fight for freedom in a world where mankind has
been enslaved in a VR world of illusion. The effects in this film are
cutting edge and I give this particular picture a good rating. I won't give
away too much of the plot but if you liked THE TERMINATOR and SPEED you
should like this.
