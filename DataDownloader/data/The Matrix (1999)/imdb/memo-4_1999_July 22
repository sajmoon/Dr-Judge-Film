1999_July 22 
<br /><br />Very neat indeed.In fact,I am going to see it again tonight at<br /><br />9.00 for the second time to be better-oriented with the storyline.I
admit,I've always been a fool for sci-fi flicks,thriller and conspiracy
films and this one is an amazing combination,I believe.We rarely have this
kind of 'intelligently and wisely' crafted science-fiction.(Total Recall,The
Abyss,2001,Blade Runner,and even Lawn-mower Man in a sense).Of course there
might be some holes which should be considered quite relative from person to
person.I wholly respect the negative-siders after reading about 50 comments
but I'm 'the one' who give this film a hearty 10 and recommend everyone to
watch it who likes brain teasing sci-fis.
