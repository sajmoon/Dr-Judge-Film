Matrix is a good film but not a masterpiece.
I really want to see nr 2 &amp; 3.
But do not hype over The Matrix. For you who thinks that this is the best
Sci-fi ever: well, Matrix is far away from best Sci-fi
ever.
Have you forgotten Star Wars saga? Or Terminator 1 &amp; 2? Or simply THE best
Sci-fi movie ever: ALIENS (1986).
So show some respect for masters like Cameron and Lucas, will
you?
