A brief glance at some of the other comments regarding this film reveal an
alarming phenomenon: it appears that some people actually LIKE The
Matrix.<br /><br />We pay the entrance fee, sit down, and then go home thinking that the
special effects were quite impressive, so we must have got our money's worth
in some convoluted way. Or maybe not. 'The Matrix' is plotless, braindead
trash designed for a channel-hopping generation. The writers clearly flicked
through an issue of Situationist International, missed the point, then threw
in a few vaguely anarchist ideas into a sludgy mix of tried-and-tested
box-office safe bets. <br /><br />The film is stylish, in a kind of early 80's way, and features some highly
dubious scenes of violence, shot in the style of car adverts.  As for the
ending, a caption reading 'Who's for a sequel?  Same place in two years
then, kids?' would have been appropriate.
