1999_October 7 

Let me be completely honest and open when I say that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a
REALLY FRIKKIN' WEIRD movie.  I breezed into the theater expecting a
run-of-the-mill action movie with lots and lots of things that go boom
with
a decent plot to move the story along, without much thought needed.  Whoo
boy, was I wrong.  We have good ol' local boy Keanu Reeves as Neo, a
hacker
with some incredible power buried deep within him, and Laurence Fishburne
as
the enigmatic Morpheus, an equally powerful hacker who trains Neo in the
use
of his incredible abilities, ranging from jumping vast distances to
nigh-unstoppable speed, strength, agility, and stamina, and the ever-cool
ability to dodge bullets and occasionally stop them dead in their tracks.
While I can't tell much more without spoiling the unbelievably cerebral
plot, I can tell you that seeing &quot;The Matrix&quot; will give you a completely
new
perspective on life.  Oh, and I did try and run up a wall in a paintball
game after I saw this movie.  If it makes you feel any better, and
especially if it gives you a good laugh, I fell flat on my
ass.
