(You have to excuse the bad spelling, because I'm from
Sweden)<br /><br />I think this picture is one of the few pictures with out any flaw, the
other
one is The Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />All the special effects is so well done that it really was a relief when
it
won the Oscar for best special effects and not Star Wars episode
I.
And the fighting scenes is SO beautiful and I usually don't find those
kind
of scenes to be any good, since I feel I've outgrown them (I'm 21 at the
moment).
But here in The Matrix they are like....art...<br /><br />To all of you who hasn't seen this movie... you really have missed
something!
The scene in the hallway (those who have seen it know what I mean) is on
of
the best scenes in the movie, total action is the least you can call
it.<br /><br />
