'The Matrix' is one of the best 
films I've seen in many years. Beneath 
its stunning and amazing visual look 
is a clever and creative mind numbing 
plot that will force you to wonder and 
ponder days after you've seen it. 
The violence is excessive but 
poetic, stylish and balletic. The 
casting and acting are wonderful. The 
subtle and odd delivery of the 'secret 
service men' villains was perfect. 
See this on the big screen for 
sure - it's a genuinely scary and 
intense picture! It blew me away the 
entire time and ranks right up there 
with 'Blade Runner'! (What more can I 
say?)
