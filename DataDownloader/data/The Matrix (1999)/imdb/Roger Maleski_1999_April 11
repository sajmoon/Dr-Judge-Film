1999_April 11 

The Matrix is essentially a revised version of Dark City, with the noirish
elements replaced by cyberpunk elements and the brooding suspense replaced
by furious action. And, of course, with Kiefer Sutherland's overacting
replaced by Keanu Reeves' underacting.<br /><br />The actors do solid jobs, but the film's real strength lies not with its
(cardboard) characters, its (silly) plot, or its (derivative) ideas, but
with its exceptionally well-executed action sequences, nicely enhanced by
some impressive but not overdone special effects. It's not a movie to make
you think, but if you're in the mood for some good, exciting action, The
Matrix ought not to disappoint you. Turn off the cerebrum and rev up that
adrenal cortex, and you'll do fine.
