&quot;The Matrix&quot; was excellent.  The action was awesome, the science fiction was
awesome, the plot line was awesome, all of the twists and turns were
awesome, and, hey, the acting wasn't all that bad either.<br /><br />I'm not a big sci-fi fan.  At all.  So when I went to go see &quot;The Matrix,&quot; I
expected it to be nothing.  Instead, it was more than the exact opposite. 
It was as far away from what I expected as you can get.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishborne, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in &quot;The Matrix,&quot;
which is about one man, Thomas Anderson (Reeves), or &quot;Neo,&quot; who is trying to
find the matrix.  The matrix is the real world, the world we live in being
nothing except that everyone is controlled.  After Neo, with the help of
Morpheous (Fishborne) and Trinity (Moss), discovers the truth, he must fight
for survival to take control of his own life.<br /><br />With all the plot twists in this movie,  it easily keeps you interested.  It
keeps feeding you, and you want to know more and more.  What also helps is
most of the performances weren't all that bad (bravo Keanu Reeves).  The
only problem I had with this movie were the Agents and their
sllllloooooowwwww talking.<br /><br />Besides that one flaw, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a must see movie.  If you were
unfortunate enough to miss it in theaters, go rent it or buy it (it's worth
it) when it comes out on video or if you have DVD.  My grade:
A-
