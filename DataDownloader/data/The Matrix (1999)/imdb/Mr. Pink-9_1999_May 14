1999_May 14 

One thing I've noticed is that people either love or hate this movie
intensely.  I fall into the former category.<br /><br />What is there to hate about this movie?  Nothing save for the acting on
some
parts (you know who.  He's taken flak in every review).<br /><br />The story:  Innovative<br /><br />The plot:  Very well executed, but the ending seems rushed.<br /><br />The effects:  Absolutely bitchin'!  They will blow you away!  This the
first
true &quot;how did they do that&quot; movie since Terminator 2.<br /><br />This may be pre-emptive, but look for this movie to be the big one of
1999.
