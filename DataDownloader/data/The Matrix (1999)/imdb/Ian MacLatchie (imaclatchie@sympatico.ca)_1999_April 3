1999_April 3 

The way Hollywood makes movies is changing, Spielberg gave us the
Jurassics, Lucas gave us the Stars Wars - whose second film of the new
trilogy will be filmed digitally, and now The Matrix steps over a new
line.<br /><br />Instead of being &quot;WOW'd&quot; by the effects, you will not see them - you
will
enjoy them, you will feel them, you will be moved by them, but the visual
effects of this film have been so meticulously intertwined with the visual
mundania, that you won't see them. And you'll love it. This is a fast
action, hard hitting, superthriller.<br /><br />Everything that I had ever hope a comic-come-to-life could be.<br /><br />Bravo! Encore!
