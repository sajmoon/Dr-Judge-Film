1999_April 29 

This movie had everything that I hate in a movie.  Special effects that's
supposed to make up for a lack of plot.  Poorly developed characters.  No
meaning whatsoever (except for some cliched, hormonal message I guess).  And
Keanu Reeves.  It was one of those movies like ID4 and Armageddon than may
be a fun ride in the theater, but you leave feeling cheapened... and guilty.
Guilty because its so utterly stupid.  This movie had a cool idea, a pretty
awesome one I might say.  The special effects were incredible.  But, those
two qualities (the only good qualities this movie had) do not make a good
movie.<br /><br />I'll give it this -- In the long line of stupid movies, this one's probably
the best.
