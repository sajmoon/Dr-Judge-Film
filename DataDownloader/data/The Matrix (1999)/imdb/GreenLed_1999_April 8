1999_April 8 

Before I saw this movie, I was going to write a letter to Keanu Reeves
asking, &quot;Why are you out to singlehandedly destroy the cyberpunk genre in
Hollywood before it's had a chance?&quot;  But after watching &quot;The Matrix,&quot; I
might actually write to thank him for giving it life!<br /><br />Well, not really, since the ones who are really responsible for this movie's
success are the Wachowski brothers.<br /><br />You ever watch &quot;sci-fi&quot; movies and think to yourself that the special
effects were kind of tacked on because they look cool, not necessarily
because they have anything to do with the story?  (Think &quot;Godzilla,&quot; &quot;Lost
in Space,&quot; etc.)  Well, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the few movies I've seen
where the special effects actually complement the story rather than detract
from it.  Before this, I've never seen the spin-around camera effect (The
Gap used it in their khaki ads) used without it being distracting and
out-of-place.  But the effect really works here.<br /><br />There are little touches to the movie that you notice the second time you
see it (and I'm sure, the third and fourth, etc.), which indicates that the
filmmakers want this to be something you watch again and again, that they
made it with the diehard movie fan in mind.  Notice, for example, the
characters' ears in this movie, and the phone books on the fridge in the
Oracle's kitchen.<br /><br />Go see it. <br /><br />
