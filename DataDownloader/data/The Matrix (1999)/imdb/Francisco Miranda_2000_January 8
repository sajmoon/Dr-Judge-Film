When you go to the movies, you always come into the darkness of the
projection place thinking about you have already seen everything, and well,
at least lets give this movie a chance.<br /><br />The Matrix changed everything, there was simply no way you could guess what
the movie come up with. I also think that maybe not other movie has
generated to much talk and analysis (personal and group) after the lights
got back.
