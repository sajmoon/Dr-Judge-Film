Mind-blowing!  Star Wars, Schmar Wars - THIS is the Sci-fi film of the
year!
A plot to grapple with and outstanding yet underplayed performances from
Reeves and Fishbourne. Although having a heavily Sci-fi theme, The Matrix
stands out to me, who has a natural dislike for Rambo-type action movies,
as
proof that there doesn't have to be a car blowing up every 30 seconds to
impress the audience.  Granted, the visual effects were stunning, if at
times superfluous, but what great fun! I must watch it again on video if I
don't decide to buy it, and no doubt there will be much that I missed on
first viewing. I defy anyone to dislike it...
