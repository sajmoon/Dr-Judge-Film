This is the film that showcases Keanu's acting talent. For his peformance in
all his other movies ranged from pathetic to mediocre.<br /><br />Aside from that, The Matrix is a kickass sci-fi/action flick. Carrie-Anne
Moss is just great as Trinity, and proves to the male population that
females can kick just as much butt as their male counterpart! The gunfight
at the end to save Morpheus is just amazing, and it is the intelligent
storyline that makes these unbelievable action scene 'real'.<br /><br />If John Woo directed this film, it would be AWESOME! (my
opinion)<br /><br />A must see film. 10/10!
