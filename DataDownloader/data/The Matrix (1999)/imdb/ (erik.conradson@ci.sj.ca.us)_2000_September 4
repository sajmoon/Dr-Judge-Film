2000_September 4 

A very important message, &quot;You are what you imagine&quot;, delivered in a slick
and a little too reckless format.  Kung Fu can never be delivered in too
large of a portion.  Guns on the other hand?  I  thought the gun orgy was
the EASIEST vein to slap upon.  Firearms have a purpose in any democratic
society.  I hate to see them portrayed as an endless wave of percussion on
which a hero surfs (as in Kowabunga!).  For a movie that danced so well
with
the the intangible issue of free will, the producers dumped the SWAT
shootout into the script like a truck load of boulders.  It was like
watching a quality comedian start making penis jokes and using the 'F'
word;
You kind of flinch and wonder why they went for the cheap laugh.<br /><br />This is a good movie that went for the cheap thrills with the gun
battle.<br /><br />8 out of 10.  It would have been a 10 without the big shootout.
