1999_April 8 

Some Sci-Fi purists may claim that there is nothing new to the concept of
&quot;The Matrix&quot;, that it can be synopsised as a derivative of previous
works...
While this may be strictly true (I'm not such an avid sci-fi junkie to
qualatively say either way) the reason for this comment's prevalence in
reviews is, in my opinion, because the film has no other negative aspect.
The plot has an astounding scope, the cinematography and imagery is
top-notch, the special effects and CGI seamless to the point where after
the
first 30min, you fail to notice them at all...  And the direction is
outstanding.  This is a well paced, albeit slightly long masterpiece of
modern day science fiction that I'd recommend to anyone as one of the top
5
movies to see this year.
