1999_May 6 

Although this movie has amazing special effects that is no excuse for this
to be a good movie.  The producers only made this movie to show their new
styles in special effects.  Effects do not make movies and cannot make
them
better. This movie lacks deeply in plot,acting,and character development.
First of all I don't even think the writers knew what the matrix really
is.
The acting is just brutal. Keannu Reeves acting makes this movie funny,
and
that's what they were probably trying to do.  The Matrix is trying to be a
revolutionary movie and his acting is just makes it more unbelievable.
The
characters are very dense and unlikable.  If you are in the mood for a
well
thought out movie do not see this one!
