1999_December 12 

One of the best films ever, dazzling special effects, occasionally
beautiful
cinamatography, and first rate hong kong action. This was a cyberpunk film
at its greatest, all the references to destroying the system, the
nihilistic
symolism. The pounding soundtrack went amazingly well with all the great
action sequences. This movie must be seen by anyone who likes sci-fi,
action, martial arts or cyberpunk movies. It is like blade runner meets
face
off.
