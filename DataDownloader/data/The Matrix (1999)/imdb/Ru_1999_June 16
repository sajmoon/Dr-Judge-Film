1999_June 16 

This is an action film that makes you think, at least a little.  The plot
doesn't stand up to much scrutiny (I can't believe it was supposed to),
and
borrows quite a lot from elsewhere, the backstory from The Terminator
being
the most obvious, but having said that, there is a great deal more going
on
below the surface.  What is reality?  How do we know that what we see is
real?  Does Fate exist, or do we just think it does with
hindsight?<br /><br />As Neo follows Alice's route through a dystopian Wonderland (following the
white rabbit, the pill/potion and cookie/cake, the cat, the teaparty in
the
messroom complete with Mouse, the people who turn into a pig, although not
one quite like the Duchess's baby, and others you can spot for yourself)
the
real becomes the surreal, which in turn becomes all too real. In the end
we
emerge from the rabbit hole to wake to our own reality, good or
bad.<br /><br />See this film.  Marvel at the effects, but think about what it's
saying.
