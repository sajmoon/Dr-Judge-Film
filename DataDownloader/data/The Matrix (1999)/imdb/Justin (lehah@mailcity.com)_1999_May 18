1999_May 18 

This film tries WAY, WAY, too hard to be a William Gibson story. Sure, the
SFX kicked butt six-ways-till-Sunday but the story was far too into itself
for it's own good. As Fishburn put it in the film: 'Some rules can bend;
some rules broken.' If that's so, I think Neo and the gang could've done a
bit more stunt work in the film if gravity could be ignored and walking up
walls was so easy. Another thing that ticked me off was the constant
REPETITIVE slow-motion dolly-shots. All right, so maybe Reeves is faster
than any man possible...SHOW IT! Slow motion just makes the audience feel
stupid (as they're forced to take in an huge amount of detail, forcing me
to
nod off in my seat in the middle of the gun fight in the
lobby).<br /><br />Gun play in the film was...uh...alright, I guess but the hand-to-hand
akido
and 'kung-fu' (I KNOW that wasn't Kung-Fu) was excellent (full support to
the stunt coordinator, who's name escapes me for now), so a little less on
the Mac10s and a little more Mac-Truck punches, please.<br /><br />Direction was alright but the dialogue was a snooze. Over all the film was
choking to be a good Johnny Mnemonic (Is that at all possible?) with good
SFX and plot. It failed in the latter.
