I worked 4 1/2 years in a video store and saw an amazing number of movies
and the Matrix is the movie in it's genre that I'll never get tired of
watching. All the elements are there, the action scenes, the plot, the
amazing soundtrack, the special effects, the chemestry of the cast... I
could go on and on and on. Simply a master piece, instant classic in my
book.<br /><br />
