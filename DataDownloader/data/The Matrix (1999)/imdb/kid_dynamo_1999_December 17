1999_December 17 

Well this was one of the big surprises of the year for me.  I thought with
all the hype this would just be a bunch of Special Effects with cheesy
acting and a happy ending.  I found I was wrong though.  The story is
unbelievable.  I was stunned as the film progressed.  It has some amazing
twists.  Unfortunately I thought it's downfall was the first half, which
got
quite boring after a while.
Still I must say this is a superb peice of filmwork.
9/10
