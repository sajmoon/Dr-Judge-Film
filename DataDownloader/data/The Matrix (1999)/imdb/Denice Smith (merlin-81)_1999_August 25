The technological advances in this movie were by themselves enough to rock
your world....The story was very good and helped all of us &quot;BladeRunner&quot;
fans feed our need for a believeable looking future with the same &quot;gritty&quot;
feel as BladeRunner. The combination of the advanced tech with the gritty
future storyline make one memorable movie!  Hope a sequel will be considered
for this one!
