&quot;Mankind is like a virus.&quot; So the agent says, and boy does that ever ring
true. This is perhaps the one moment in the film that does provoke thought.
The rest of it however, is like Star Wars Ep. 1 - being crushed by a huge,
endless, almost pointless but philosophical and entertaining video-game
which dares ask the question &quot;what would it be like to be a computer virus.&quot;
