This movie works in many ways.  The martial arts sequences were
surprisingly
good.  The plot was well executed. The villain was a true s.o.b. and for
those of you who like guns, well, there's a great scene for
you.<br /><br />The film took some very basic elements, good, evil, redemption and spun an
exciting tale.  While the movie wasn't exactly unpredictable, it simply
didn't matter.  The movie is filled with action, and great special effects
that don't overpower the story line. Also, there's tons of symbolism in
this
movie.  You can make Christ, Buddha, Zen, and whatever else, analogies
until
the cows come home.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is simply a lot of Fun!!!
