1999_May 3 

Science fiction is extremely difficult to encapsulate in a 2-hour movie.
It
isn't bound by the usual physical laws - but it is bound by laws which
must
be explained to make sense.  Also, it's futuristic, it's logical, and it's
exciting.  That describes The Matrix: the only sci fi pic I've seen that
watches like a good sci fi novel reads.<br /><br />If you read other reviews following this one (read the one by Dr Kat),
you'll see that another reviewer complained about &quot;holes in the plot you
could drive a truck through&quot;.  I'm very sensitive to plot holes, and I
honestly didn't see any in this movie.  For this genre of movie it's a
reasonably tight plot.<br /><br />I went somewhat reluctantly expecting another Johnny Mnemonic, but by the
middle of the movie I found myself really enjoying the ride.  I don't
quite
know how to express this except to say that I dislike the cardboard cutout
futurism of Johnny Mnemonic, Blade Runner, Total Recall or any other &quot;the
future is dark, bleak, dirty, grimy, with punk haircuts and Bowie-esque
makeup&quot; movies.  The Matrix admittedly had a trace of that (more than I
would have liked - ie, why such a grubby ship and ripped clothes?), but it
really got beyond it.  'Way beyond it.  Burning cars and punk haircuts are
not the entire future vision of this movie's director (in fact, there are
no
burning cars or punk haircuts that I recall).<br /><br />Oh, by the way - I went expecting great special effects and wowie-zowie
fight scenes.  While they're cool to watch, I grimace when I have to shut
off brain to watch obviously choreographed action.  However, I was
impressed
at the way the director worked these impossible visuals into a logical,
thinking-man's plot (inside a computer simulation, if you can hack the
program, you can manipulate).  It worked for me.<br /><br />Verdict: I give The Matrix a 9.  It's a credible sci-fi plot, and the fun
explorations of pop philosophy (&quot;If a tree falls...&quot; and &quot;Which reality is
real?&quot;) made the audience chuckle.  This is one I have to see again.  But
do
yourself a favour: see it on the big screen, don't wait for the
video.<br /><br />&gt;
