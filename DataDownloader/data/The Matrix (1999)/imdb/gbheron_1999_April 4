1999_April 4 

Combine engrossing Sci-Fi storytelling with the non-stop action of a martial
arts film, then add a large dose of special effects and you have The Matrix.<br /><br />Set is the distant future, machines have taken over a devastated Earth.
Humans have long-since been enslaved, spending their entire lives suspended
in liquid pods providing energy to the machines.  For their part the
machines have created an artificial reality in which the collective
consciousnesses of Earth's inhabitants reside, The Matrix.  Guess what?
It's patterned after 1999 Earth, and the humans are clueless as to what's
happened to them.<br /><br />But not everybody's in The Matrix.  A rebel band led by Fishburn dash in and
out of it, rescuing humans and searching for their promised Messiah.  One
whom they target is computer programmer Reeves who begins to receive some
very odd communications at his terminal...and thus begins the
story.<br /><br />The Matrix is both a thrill-a-second roller coaster ride, and a skillfully
presented science fiction story.  The story unfolds slowly, as Reeves goes
from complete ignorance of his and humankind's fate, to his destiny
revealed.  The journey's a trip.<br /><br />If you enjoy films like the Terminator, T2, RoboCop, Face/Off, and Blade
Runner definitely go see this film.  If you're a My Dinner with Andre, or
Sleepless in Seattle type, give it a pass. <br /><br />
