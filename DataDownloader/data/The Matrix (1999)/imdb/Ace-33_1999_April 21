1999_April 21 

This movie has no equal when it comes to combining the hottest action
scenes, the coolest protagonists, thought-provoking dialogue, and direct
parallels to the Old and New Testatment. It's hard to believe that Keanu
finally gets to play Jesus Christ in designer shades -- but he pulls it off
miraculously!<br /><br />Just pay attention to the way the movie uses the terms Zion, Trinity,
Nebuchadnezzar, the Oracle, the very first Matrix, sacrificing one's life
for another, and especially the resurrection of the Chosen One. Never has a
movie so skillfully employed Biblical doctrine in such a revealing fashion
without offending unbelievers. Those who believe in the One will know what
I'm talking about when they watch this thrilling movie!
