1999_April 5 

By far the sweetest action/sci-fi/special effects flick I've seen in a
good,long time.  The acting is superb (especially by the
ever-under-appreciated Laurence Fishburne) and the special effects are...
Well you saw the trailers, right?
Despite the title, fans of William Gibson and Shadowrun won't be nearly as
impressed/inspired by this one as players of White Wolf's &quot;Mage&quot;
role-playing game.  But if you have any love of science fiction at all, go
watch this one.  I'm gonna buy it when it comes out.
