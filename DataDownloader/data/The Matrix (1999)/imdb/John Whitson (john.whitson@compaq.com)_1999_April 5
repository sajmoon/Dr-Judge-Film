1999_April 5 

Nearly every aspect of this movie was impressive.  The plot was internally
self-consistent, there was no problem with suspension of disbelief, and it
had a workable premise.  As a pure SF movie, it worked well.  As a cool
story it flowed nicely.  As an action movie, there was not a pause in the
rush.  It had no gratuitous sex, and all the violence was an integral part
of the plot line.  The FX were entirely apropos to the story, and worked
seamlessly.  I intend to watch it again this week, and to purchase the DVD
on its release date.<br /><br />I expect the critics panned it because it either disagreed with some aspect
of their personal taste, or (more likely) because it wasn't simplistic easy
to swallow pablum.
