1999_April 9 

I loved the matrix. It had a solid story, which is rare in most
contemporary
Sci-Fi, tons of eye-candy, and exhilarating action sequences. There are
holes in the story, and I think the directors could have stretched our
imagination a little further. But any holes that you can find in the plot
are easily made up for by the films style and and over-all feel.
