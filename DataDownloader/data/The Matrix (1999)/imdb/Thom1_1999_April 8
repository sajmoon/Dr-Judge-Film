1999_April 8 

While many movies over the years give us a new slant on an old theme, The
Matrix has gone far deeper to mine it's golden plot line.  I will not
repeat
what so many before me have pointed out in praise of this monumental
flick...But I will note the successful presentation of true
existentialism,
Sartre would be proud...This movie doesn't ask if a tree falling in the
forest makes noise, it makes you question if there is even a
forest!
