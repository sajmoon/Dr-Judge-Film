1999_August 28 

Actually it is not only a great action movie, the director also wants to
say
something in the movie. It's not a simple story. We have no idea whether
the
world we are now living is true or just a dream. Real or not real? What a
deep question from the movie.<br /><br />Those gun fighting scenes are excellent. Although they really let me think
of John Woo's films but they are still very cool.<br /><br />Anyway, don't miss this film. And if you like Matrix, please also try Dark
City. It is also a very interesting cult movie.
