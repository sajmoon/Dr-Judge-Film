1999_May 18 

This is the most disappointing film I have seen in years.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; had special effects galore, but no plot, character depth or
development, and dreadful music.  I actually yawned out loud several times
during the screening, but no-one would have been able to hear me over the
never-ending sounds of violence coming from the screen.<br /><br />This film seems in some way to be a *summary* of other recent films such
as
&quot;Dark City&quot; and &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.  The writers did not bother to go into
many details in the story.  The script was also full of stupid-sounding
lines that were obviously intended to sound &quot;deep and meaningful&quot;.<br /><br />It appears that there were lots of violent scenes the authors wanted to
put
on film, but it was too much trouble to fit a story to
them.
