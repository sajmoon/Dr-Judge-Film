1999_April 8 

This is one of the very few films ever released that I have seen twice
(and
I will probably see it again).  I do not see where people say there is
little story here.  Just watch it and you will see it has a great story.
Parts of the movie may be taken off others, but, in this movie, the things
that were done before are done with such style that I do not think people
would mind that the filmmakers used them.  The whole movie has this style
that just exudes from it.  This movie ranks up there with Terminator 2 in
terms of overall effects and story to me.<br /><br />Now I am no big time reviewer, so I probably cannot judge most things they
can, but I do know what I, as a serious sci-fi and action, like and this
definitely is in that pot.<br /><br />GO SEE IT!
