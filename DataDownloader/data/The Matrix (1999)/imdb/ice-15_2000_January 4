As technological advancements continue to rapidly grow, moviegoers are
provided access to even the most stunning of virtual effects. Multimedia
progression has allowed the movie industry to bring revolutionary amazement
to its audience. This brings us to the question `What is the
Matrix?'<br /><br />The Matrix sounds essentially complex but nonetheless brings us to its
simple premise. The film implies that our perception to reality is not what
it seems. It is only a systemized generated world controlled by computers
born in the wake of artificial intelligence. This system must be completely
destroyed in order to free humanity &#150; and that goal lies upon `the
one'.<br /><br />Played by Keanu Reeves, Neo is the one that must gradually realize the
truth. But emancipating from the world he was suited is a challenge &#150; a
formidable task to which humanity's liberation depends
upon.<br /><br />What we see next after realizing this concept is Neo's preparation and his
encounter with deadly foes called agents. The moments are shown in highly
technical virtual effects that viewers have never been seen. The film
becomes a revolutionary wonder with its amazing tricks. Digital slow
motioning of battle sequences is a phenomenal approach. But after a series
of remarkable battles to excite the audience, the film ends with a stunted
conclusion. Viewers are left in question what will happen &#150; to Neo, the
agents and The Matrix.<br /><br />This brings me to an ending. What is the Matrix? Unfortunately, no one can
truly answer it because it remains indefinite. But for sure, The Matrix is
the precursor of an extension.<br /><br />
