1999_May 2 
<br /><br />The movie is not bad. It is one of the better movies that I've seen in
theaters lately. But it's definitely overrated.<br /><br />Everything in this movie just seems to be forced. It seems like the
writers
of the movie got together and said: &quot;OK, we're gonna make a smart SciFi
movie full of action and existentialist ideas at the same time - everyone
must love this movie.&quot;<br /><br />And it seems like everyone does like the movie. Maybe that's what bothers
me
the most - looks like the creators made the movie with an intent to please
everyone. And we all know that such a task is an impossible
one.<br /><br />The movie starts off really nicely, with some really original ideas and
with
some philosophical ideas that can be interpreted on various levels - which
is
great. But then it turns into an action movie, with cheesy martial arts
scenes and an exhibition of modern weapons. What was the purpose of the
scene in the building where they killed 20+ people and turned the place
into
Swiss cheese ? It's not the violence I'm complaining about, I've seen it
in
movies before, but how does this all fit into an intelligent movie? That's
what's wrong about it - like the writers looked back at the movie and
thought it was too smart or something and then decided to put in a few
guns,
some martial arts and let the stunt men do their thing.<br /><br />This movie just kept pleasantly surprising me and disappointing me at the
same time. The ending is good - left open and unanswered. But then I heard
a
sequel was already being made. Why !?? So that an already critical movie
would lose all its credibility ?<br /><br />This movie really has a nice idea behind it, but the writers really
screwed
up. It sort of reminds me of &quot;Dark City&quot;, now that I think of
it.<br /><br />Go see the movie. Create your own opinion. Don't think it's a good movie
just because your friends loved it.
