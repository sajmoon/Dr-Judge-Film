2000_April 10 

I am sorry to add such sadness to the comments but this movie is much more
the running on walls and shoot-out scenes.  This movie is revolutionary not
for its ground breaking effects but mostly for its principal. It says to the
world that what we are doing and the way we live is WRONG, or at least it
could be.  It does say that living as drones and following the system makes
you nothing but a battery to those in power. I get upset to read your
reviews that only discuss acting, cinematography and how cute Mr. Reeves is.
Didn't this movie make you think. This wasn't like Con-Air that was just
about blowing things up and causing havoc and then saving the day at the end
of the film. This movie was brilliant because the thoughts it provoked, its
fluid story, and constant questioning of what we've been taught. I give it a
nine and say to those who haven't seen it please do so but look further than
the million dollar shots and even more costly actors and look for the
meaning within.
