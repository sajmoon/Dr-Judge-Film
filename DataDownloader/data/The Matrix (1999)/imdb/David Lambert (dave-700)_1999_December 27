1999_December 27 

I think The Matrix is a great movie. It shows great special effects, a
great
plot, and has great stars. It shows great detail and they use special
effects wisely. It's based on a computer hacker that finds out he doesn't
really live in 1999, but around 2199. The world is really rubbish. The
Matrix is all of the people in separate tanks. The people are really asleep
in a kind of virtual reality, that simulates they are in 1999. Watch the
movie to find out what it's like.
