I have watched The Matrix numerous times and always wondered about
Agent Smith&#39;s peculiar way of speaking. Today while watching a portion
of the old PBS series Cosmos by Carl Sagan, I thought they had used
Hugo Weaving&#39;s voice to narrate but it was indeed Carl Sagan with his
rounding of sounds, pausing and emphasizing, and pursed lips that was
speaking. Does anyone know if this is where Hugo Weaving drew
inspiration for his manner of speech in The Matrix series? As for the
series itself, movie #1 is by far the most exciting, after which the
Wachowski Bros writing devolves into a mismash of junk. The last two
movies have their moments but some scenes are painful to watch, I.E.
the rave and those awful loves scenes with Neo and Trinity.
