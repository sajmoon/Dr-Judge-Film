1999_April 11 

A movie that pays tribute to many of the great sci-fi movies of the past
while charting its own territory.  Great, great action sequences, superb
cinematography, well realized concept.  First half hour a little slow but
after that the movie pulls you in and just keeps building.  Please let the
Academy nominate a sci-fi movie for once and give full credit to the
creative visuals in this film.  Critics usually have trouble &quot;getting&quot;
sci-fi movies: this movie's visuals deserve the chance to put an end to
the
embarrassing lack of critical appreciation of this genre.
