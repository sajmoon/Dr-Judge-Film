1999_April 18 

Ok, this is the best movie I've ever seen.  Its story really does make you
wonder(and I know you have all wondered things like this before the movie)
if something like the Matrix is real!  The whole movie is amazing, from
the
story straight down to the solid acting performance(especially my fav
actress miss Carrie-Anne Moss[she's my favorite for a long time now]).  I
like the special effects, especially the &quot;Bullet Time&quot; that John Gaeta
did!
I'll have seen it three times once Thurday comes around cause I'm seeing
it
again on Wednesday!!  Tremendous!
