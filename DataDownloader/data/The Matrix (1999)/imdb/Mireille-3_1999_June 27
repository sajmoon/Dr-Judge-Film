1999_June 27 

Well, a lot has been said about of this movie, so I will keep it short.
Maybe I have seen one action movie too many, but the Matrix isn't a very
special one. Actually I thought it was rather boring and slow and one big
Nokia commercial for which you actually have to pay money to see it. A lot
of cliche oneliners like &quot;it is my way or the highway&quot;, oh come on.....<br /><br />I rate this movie a 4 out of 10
