1999_April 4 

A high-powered, super slick sci-fi action thriller!  This movie has some of
the best fight scenes and action sequences I have ever seen.  All superbly
shot with cutting-edge cinematography and well-integrated into a plot that
could have been a tired revisitation of archetypal themes, yet instead put a
slick, lively, and extremely exciting spin on a fascinating theme of
&quot;what-is-reality?&quot;  Great performances by all actors, (particularly by Hugo
Weaving and including Keanu Reeves for a change) combined with intense
martial arts study added to the film's credibility and well-executed
suspension-of-disbelief.  An extremely enjoyable and technically masterful
film that I highly recommend.
