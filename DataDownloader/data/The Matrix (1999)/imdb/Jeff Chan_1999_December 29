The Matrix has excellent special effects, ok if exaggerated
action scenes, mixed acting, an ok premise and somewhat
weak story.  Fishburne is quite good; Reeves is flat.  I found the
screenplay threadbare, giving the actors not enough meat to work with.  The
premise is marginal and a bit watered down to make it as science fiction. 
The story and direction leave holes big enough to drive trucks through. <br /><br />About half way through the movie disbelief kicked back in
and
the film seemed merely a platform for special effects. 
In
comparison, Mel Gibson's Payback is a more intriguing and better directed
revenge/action flick, and Johnny Nmemonic (also featuring Reeves) has better
Cyberspace science fiction.<br /><br />This is a violent film, which I have little problem with
in
general, but here it's particularly de-humanizing which I
*do*
object to.  Payback is extremely violent and profane, but the violence is
focussed and meaningful in that it serves to advance the plot and has human
consequences.  The violence in The Matrix blends a cartoon-like disregard
for its consequences with an elitist notion that it's all ok because the
human victims have been brainwashed by the bad guys and are essentially
pawns in a larger game.  Violence should have a moral dimension or at least
move the plot if it's to have meaning.  If not, it desensitizes viewers to
violence which can't be a healthy thing for society.
It also makes for a boring movie.
