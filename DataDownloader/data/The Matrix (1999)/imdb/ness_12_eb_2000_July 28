&quot;What is, 'real'?  How do you define, 'real'?&quot;  The words of Morpheus
being
played by Laurence Fishburne, in one of, in my opinions, the greatest
movie
ever to hit the screen-The Matrix.<br /><br />The Graphics, special effects, thrill, and action are floored way past the
limit of pure enjoyment.  The storyline and plot is excellent, the acting
was a little bad at a few points, but not really, the movie all in all was
most likely the best movie i saw in a long time.<br /><br />You have to see it to believe it-no one can tell you exactly how
incredible
this movie is.  &quot;You have to see it for yourself.&quot;
