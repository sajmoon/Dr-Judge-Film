1999_April 4 

Three words:  OH MY GOD!  This movie kicked serious @$$!  I saw it once on
Friday(4.3.99) and again today(4.4.99).  Matrix is my new favorite movie. If
you haven't seen it yet, drop whatever you're doing and get yourself to a
movie theater!  Every aspect of this movie is wonderful!  The martial arts
sequences are INCREDIBLE!  (NO STUNTMEN, ALL DONE BY THE
ACTORS)
The SFX are unbelievable.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
