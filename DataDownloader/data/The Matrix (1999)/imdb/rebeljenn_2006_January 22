'The Matrix' is a film about the concept of reality and identity. The
lead character is transformed into an alternate world through the help
of Morpheus, and he learns to battle the machines. This is a very deep
film, and it is one that will make you think about life and reality.
It's also a film that can be watched multiple times. One of the best
areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes
where the cameras rotate fully around the action. This is the highlight
of the film, and without that, it would be almost like any other
science-fiction/action movie. In my opinion, the story and characters
are a little bit weak, but the concept and the special effects make
this movie well-worth a watch.
