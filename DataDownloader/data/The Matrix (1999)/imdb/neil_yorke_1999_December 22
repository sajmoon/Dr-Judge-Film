1999_December 22 

&quot;The Matrix&quot; exploded on to our screens in June 99, and totally blew it
audience away with it rich blend of special affects and story
telling.<br /><br /> It's one of the best films I have seen to date and I've seen quite a few.
It's use of new special affect techniques allow never before seen images to
amaze and bewilder you.<br /><br /> The story revolves around a computer hacker named &quot;Neo&quot; who is persuded by
shadowy figures to help them capture a known terrorist, but as he is about
to find out the truth is very much different than anything which he could
have dreamed up. This film does what films have the best ability to do,
which is transport you to another time and another place and allow you to
view things as if you were actually there. It's a great way to escape the
rigors of life for a few hours.<br /><br /> The actors are all on top form and there are some memorable moments from
some of the newer actors. I did however feel that on occations it did rely
heavely on it's special affects, to hold it up but then in other parts there
is real story telling.<br /><br /> Overall a really good film which you will want to watch time and time
again.
