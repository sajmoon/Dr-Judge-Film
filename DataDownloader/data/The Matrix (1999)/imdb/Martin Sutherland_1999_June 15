1999_June 15 

If I had to summarize _The Matrix_ in a single word, it would have to be
&quot;Cool&quot;.  It's slicker than a greased spanner, smoother than ice.  In their
black leather and PVC gear Keanu Reeves et al. walk around like they own
the
copyright on cool.<br /><br />Even if it didn't have a decent plot, it would be worth seeing just for
the
sheer visual fun of it, but the plot itself is pretty good, too.  The
whole
&quot;power source&quot; theory is nuts and doesn't make much sense, but apart from
that it builds from confusion through a series of setbacks into a
near-perfect climax that leaves you gagging for more.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers lay on the allegory and &quot;intelligence&quot; perhaps a
little too thickly (the Alice in Wonderland theme is pushed a tad too hard
for my taste), but they have put enough effort into creating a believable
and genuinely science-fictional (rather than &quot;sci-fi&quot;) world, that the
film
works on the mind as well as on the viscera.<br /><br />All in all, it's a cracker.  I saw it in a cinema with just old-fashioned
stereo sound, and with the bottom half of the picture somewhat blurred,
but
it still blew me away.  It's the first film in years that I absolutely
*have* to go back in and see again.  And then buy the video....
