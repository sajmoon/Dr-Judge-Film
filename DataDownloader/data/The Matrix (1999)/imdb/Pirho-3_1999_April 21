Reeves, and Fishburne, make a fantastic duo in this high packed action film.
This film raises many interesting questions, that require the movie to be
seen over and over again to before finally getting an acceptable answer to
them.<br /><br />Not since Johnny Mnemonic has Reeves been this good.  The movie give an
interesting twist to what people perceive as life.
