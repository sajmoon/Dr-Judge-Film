1999_April 30 

The best of the genre so far.  Aside from some plot holes
big enough for a truck, this is a wonderful special effects
romp.  The acting is perfect (low key) for the film, too.
Sit back and take the ride.  You won't feel ripped off for paying $8.50 or
whatever.  Cheaper than Disneyland.
