2001_February 2 

I didn't see this movie in the theater when it first came out.  I admit that
was mostly in due to the fact that it had Keanu Reeves in it.  Quite
possibly the worst actor of our generation.  However, I am not the type to
write something off until I actually see it.  I had heard through reviews of
others that it was a thought provoking and original idea and I was hoping
that it would live up to the hype.  Boy, was I disappointed.<br /><br />Granted, we live in a world where originality in movies, books, or any sort
of fiction is a rarity.  While almost every conceivable story has been done
in some sort, we do occasionally get something fresh.  The Matrix, despite
the common belief is not one of these.  It is, in fact, one of the oldest
stories in the world.  Refer to Plato's Allegory of the Cave in The
Republic.  Is this why I'm saying The Matrix is a forgettable movie? <br /><br />No.  I'm saying that because the acting is less than stellar, aside from a
great performance by the always entertaining Fishburne.  In my opinion, the
movie would have been much more tolerable were someone like Johnny Depp
chosen for the part of Neo.  At least he can actually act.  On top of this,
the movie rides more on action sequences rather than plot or character
development.  <br /><br />The Matrix isn't the only movie to take from Plato's Allegory of the Cave. 
It has been done on more than one occasion.  However, if you want a good
story, go with The 13th Floor or Dark City.  If you want action sequences,
the Matrix is better off for you.
