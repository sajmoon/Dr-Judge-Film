This is the third comment I have put on here but I have just seen 'The
Matrix' for the 12th time (yes I know 12th!) and I think it is the most
clever, action packed, fun filled and not to mention creative movie I have
ever seen.The first time I saw it I completly fell in love with it (And
Keanu Reeves!)
The Wachowski Brothers really did do their homework and the concept of the
film is brilliant. It isn't one of those American Junky movies where boy
meets girl , boy falls in love with girl,
It is one where you don't get mushy rubbish (okay so there is one two minute
part) you get an action packed fun ride that keeps you and you're pals
amused. My only regret is that I didn't see the movie sooner! I saw it
January this year. 
And please people i'm sick of you saying 'Keanu Reeves can't act to save his
life' because you are just jealous because he's got the looks and the talent
something which you dumb people don't have.Anyway, this might sound silly
but 'The Matrix' gets me all phsyced up before I go for a run. It really
does. Watch the Ju Titsu parts where he fights Morpheus and it really
helps.
The visual effects are truly amazing, and the sound and it really deserved
those four Oscars, but I still think it deserved more Oscars than
that.
Well anyway any other Keanu Fans email me!
See ya,

P.P.S: I LOVE YOU NEO!<br /><br />
