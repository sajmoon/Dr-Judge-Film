1999_May 9 

This coulda been a contender.  Actually, it kind of was, at least the
first
two hours.  What starts out as a mediocre hacker movie rapidly reveals
itself to be a full-bodied, classic, sci-fi story for the ages.  But then
it
gets side-tracked, stepping away from the complicated story and getting
comfortable in the special-effects enhanced, but basically old-fashioned,
shoot-out and marshall-arts sequences.  What could have been a great
sci-fi
film ends up as an action movie.  Plenty of pulse-pounding action to be
sure, but not what this film could have been.<br /><br />To be fair, this film mainly suffers by comparison with those truly great
dark sci-fi films:  &quot;Dark City,&quot; &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; &quot;City of Lost Children,&quot;
&quot;Brazil.&quot;  Not being able to measure up doesn't make it a bad film, but
the
first two hours of this 144 minute epic promised so much more.  It COULD
have been in the same league, all it needed was a better ending to pull
together a bunch of loose ends and to emphasize the sci-fi premise.
Instead, and not a bad condolence prize for fans of Hong Kong action
movies,
Keanu Reeves gives a performance in the shootouts that would make Chow Yun
Fat envious.
