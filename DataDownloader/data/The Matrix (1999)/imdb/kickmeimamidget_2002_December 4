I am a fan of 'The Matrix', despite the fact that I don't like Keanu Reeves,
and very much enjoy watching it. I find it to be a very interesting story
with parallels to many other stories and historical figures. What most
interested me in this story was that I found some very striking parallels to
the life story of Jesus Christ<br /><br />There were many characters who I thought paralleled characters in the story
of Jesus' life. First of all, Neo is much like Jesus himself, being 'the
one' who many are waiting for, 'the one' who will save the human race from
bondage. There are also many prophecies made about Neo before his time, just
as there were prophecies made about Jesus.  Morpheus played a role very
similar to John the Baptist, preparing the way for 'the one', coming before
him, and having faith in Neo/Jesus by realizing how powerful he really is.
The crew on the Nebachadnezzer is much like the followers of Jesus, or the
deciples, with one specific character standing out: Cypher. Cypher betrays
Neo just as Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.<br /><br />Other very noticeable parallels to the story of Jesus include the part were
Neo comes back to life after being killed by the agents, which is like the
resurrection of Jesus. Neo triumphed over death and the Matrix; Jesus
triumphed over sin and death. The Agents themselves seem to be like demons,
who are the agents of the devil. Also, the faceplate on the core of the
Nebachadnezzer says Mark III VI. In the Bible, Mark 3:11 (NIV) reads, `When
ever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, 'You
are the Son of God.' ' This is in reference to Jesus (him), and could very
well be foreshadowing for Neo in the way he will control the agents in the
movie.<br /><br />There are many more parallels that can be drawn, some biblical, some
non-biblical. I do not think 'The Matrix' to be an exact depiction of Jesus'
life, nor do I know what the Wachowski brothers had in mind when they made
this movie. I simply found these parallels to make the movie very
interesting to watch.<br /><br />
