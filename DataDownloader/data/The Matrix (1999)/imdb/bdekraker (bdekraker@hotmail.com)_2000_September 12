This movie is awesome. Not once do you get bored... you just fly through
it,
and at the end you look back and say &quot;WOW! This movie is sweet!&quot; And then,
you never sleep for 5 nights because you are thinking about the Matrix...
and about what the Oracle said to Neo!<br /><br />I really believe this movie is the best sci-fi movie ever... better than
star wars for sure.<br /><br />
