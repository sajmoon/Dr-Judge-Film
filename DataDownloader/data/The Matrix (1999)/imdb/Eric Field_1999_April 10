Finally, originality from Hollywood!  The Matrix marks a triumphant return
for Keanu Reeves to the big screen.  With action sequences more intense and
fierce than your worst nightmares, The Matrix exceeds expectations by
throwing the audience head first into a world where nothing is at all what
it seems.  Such a unique story line and special effects made this movie more
enjoyable than any other sci-fi thriller that has surfaced recently.  The
only movie that could possibly hope to be more stunning is Star Wars:
Episode 1.
