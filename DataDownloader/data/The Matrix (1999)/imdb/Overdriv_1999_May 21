1999_May 21 

This movie takes the &quot;intelligent action-thriller&quot; genre started by _Face
Off_ to a new level...  For people who enjoy philosophical speculation and
exploration of deep concepts, this movie is sure to satisfy.  Although
some
complain that there are many derivative ideas in the film, you have to
remember that &quot;Mediocre artists borrow.  Great artists steal.&quot;  In
stealing
some of the best ideas in philosophy and filmmaking from the past 20+
years
(the visual references are Simpsons-esque in their ubiquity ;-) , the
Wachowski brothers have given concepts that are usually relegated to
incomprehensible &quot;art films&quot; mainstream appeal, and they do it with a
great
sense of style.  Kudos.<br /><br />If you enjoy Sci-Fi or Action movies, _The Matrix_ will not disappoint;
similarly, if you enjoy metaphysical mental explorations (and are quick
enough to appreciate them in a movie context), _The Matrix_ will also push
your buttons.  Basically, anyone with a slow mental clock speed need not
apply - brainiac adrenalin-junkies, this one's for you!<br /><br />Although this movie *has* taken my #1 spot for best movie of all time
(from
_Apocalypse Now_), there are a few downsides:<br /><br />Keanu (or as my Brit friend pronounces it, Canoe - as in a hollowed-out
chunk of wood) utilizes his natural ability to look clueless perfectly
through most of the movie, then doesn't blow it when he has to seem like
he
knows what he's doing.  He's OK, but his romantic chemistry in the film
leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />There are also several supporting characters who are not really given a
chance to develop quite thoroughly, although I think the film strikes a
good
balance due to the limitations of the cinema format (can't be too long -
try
seeing _Dances With Wolves_ more than once!).  In addition, I believe _The
Matrix_ was supposed to be the center part of a trilogy, so perhaps more
exposition will be forthcoming.<br /><br />Lastly, those of us who have thought about some of the ideas explored in
_The Matrix_ may find that the movie doesn't go *far enough* - there are
so
many more great questions that could have been posed, but again, you can't
try and overload a movie, so by and large, all complaints I could have
with
the movie are minor.<br /><br />Bottom line:  WHOA!  Go see it!<br /><br />
