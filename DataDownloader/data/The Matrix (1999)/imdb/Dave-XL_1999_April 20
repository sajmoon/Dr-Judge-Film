What is the Matrix? A good, fun flick. If the previews interest you then
you'll have a great time, but be wary of buying into the hype building
around this movie.<br /><br />This movie delivers a good dose of action, though I felt it did sag a bit
around the middle, needing more plot twists --or failing that, action-- to
keep the audience perched on the edge of their seat. The film is quite
good-looking, stylish and well shot throughout. The rebels are given a
Gibsonesque leatherette hipness and satisfyingly seedy boho-tech digs. The
jazzed up chopsocky and lead-slinging scenes are Woo-rific. And there are
some great sci-fi visuals that aren't hinted at in the trailers I've
seen.<br /><br />But style is one thing and a unique creative vision something else. I didn't
feel The Matrix offered anything original enough to merit comparison to
visual feasts like Blade Runner or Fifth Element.<br /><br />Most important, to my mind, is to understand that the &quot;box-within-a-box&quot;
plot is not as dense or complex as the hype may have led you to believe. Not
that the previews had me expecting a towering intellectual challenge, but
numerous reviews and firsthand accounts have painted the plot as a
deliciously nonlinear mindwarp. There is at least one pretty good gotcha
involved, but let's face it: Hollywood's idea of multi-layered complexity
only goes so far. The plot serves as a decent excuse for 2+ hours of
hyperkinetic eye candy but accomplishes nothing much as a
story.<br /><br />I worried plenty beforehand about Keanu ruining the film with his leaden
acting, but the role of Neo does not really give him an opportunity to screw
up. He fights, he shoots, he looks puppy dog earnest, and along the way he
delivers a few lines so brief that even The Stilted One doesn't have time
enough to queer them. Basically he's a pretty action toy.<br /><br />This is a glossy, goofy-fun flick and well worth seeing on the big screen
for fans of same, but I'm afraid it's not a milestone in terms of visual
accomplishment or intelligent storytelling. The Matrix could be much, much
worse, but it could also be much better. Keep your expectations in line with
what Hollywood delivers and you'll have a great time.
