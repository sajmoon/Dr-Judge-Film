I&#x27;ve always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It&#x27;s a mix of many
different films put together with component parts stolen from the
Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of
humanity), Total Recall (futuristic &#x27;Is it a dream or reality&#x27; sci-fi)
and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu
Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and &#x27;go into
them&#x27;), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.<br /><br />Thomas &#x27;Neo&#x27; Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with
the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to
know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth
and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body,
and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the
machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world
that they now rule is not explored).<br /><br />Convinced that Neo is &#x27;The One&#x27;, Morpheous trains him to be deadly
digital warrior, but this set-up doesn&#x27;t go beyond fighting a sentient
program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively
influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the
&#x27;Die Hard&#x27; formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and
with practical stuntwork. In it&#x27;s place they all went for excessive
CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible
physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn&#x27;t ever
entertain or excite me.<br /><br />It&#x27;s the style of the Matrix that&#x27;s more fondly cherished than the
story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix
is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this
movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction
in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.
