1999_April 5 

This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I didn't even
mind the $9.50(canadian, yet!) price tag.  In fact, I am planning on seeing
it again.  Excellent cast.  All I can say is, it really makes you think.
The premise is an updated version of the &quot;What if we are just an experiment
in a petri dish in a lab somewhere?&quot; question. Even if you don't like Keanu,
it's still a really good pic.
