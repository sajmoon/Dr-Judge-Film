Ok, maybe the argument is weak... The possibilities of a world in
suspension, can be more than the story tell us...<br /><br />But the sequence of images, the &quot;flow&quot; between one scene and other, the
visual possibility of be there, like an omnipotent witness, who can&acute;t stop
the time and accelerates it it&acute;s, for me, the best of this motion
picture...<br /><br />The great mix of images, music and performances give us great action
scenes
(maybe not the better ones in the history, but...) that make you ask...
&quot;Real... What is real, Neo????&quot;<br /><br />Control of the reality... the dream of all human been.. This picture give
the impression to be the push of a new generation of &quot;virtual&quot; dreamers
(hackers)... They believe in freedom beyond the system... This motion
picture, will be the emblematic of them... A colt has born!!!!!
