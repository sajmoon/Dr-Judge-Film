Is this real? or is it not real? what is real? how do you define
it?
Is it what you can fell, taste or smell??
What if I wake up in the morning and go to work? is it still a
dream?
All these questions are what The Matrix deals with.
Are we living what is real?? or are we controlled by another being that is
manipulating our lives for it's own good??<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to hide you
from the truth.&quot;
&quot;What truth??&quot; Says Neo.
Well that is for you to find out in this epic motion picture.
The movie outlines the story of a computer programmer named Thomas
Anderson
who is at nights a hacker named Neo.
Neo is always looking around for a thing known as The Matrix until one day
he is called to meet Triniti who will show him all that he needs to
know.<br /><br />It's not just a chip-off-the-block high octane action, it has humor in it
and some drama if you want to call it that way.
You can classify it no better than &quot;Forget everything you know and
seen&quot;.
They got that right.
I usually happen to spit out one-liners at some scenes to what eventually
will be the thing the actors will say.
It worked in The Mummy, but not here.
I tried a few times but given up when I saw I just wasn't getting it
right,
they made it completely new and thrilling.<br /><br />Some said that the special effects in The Mummy will blow you away.  Well,
I
guess in The Mummy they only used a simple pump shot gun because here it's
freaking C-4.
It's totally amazing how they did everything look so to the point and
reliable.<br /><br />And as a conclusion I can only say this: What would you think if someone
would come up to you one day and say that nothing is real, it doesn't
exist
and you have to make it all better?
&quot;No one can be told what The Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.&quot;
Trust me, he knows what he's talking about, I went to see it, it was worth
every second and I'll go see it again.
