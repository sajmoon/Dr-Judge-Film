this is truly the most awesome movie i have ever seen, and i've seen more
than a few!  the special effects are astounding, and acting is superb and
the plot is mind-bending!  personally, i suggest that if you ever see only
one movie, forget TITANIC and go for a REAL movie!  This is no doubt the
best film of the year, or even the next ten years!
