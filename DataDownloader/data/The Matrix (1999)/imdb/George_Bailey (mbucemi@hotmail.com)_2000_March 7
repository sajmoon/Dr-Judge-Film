<br /><br />It seemed like the days of The Terminator, Aliens and Predator were over.
Nobody had the vision anymore to craft a hardcore action sci-fi masterpiece
that would kick our faces in. We had a few glimmers of hope here and there,
but in 1999 it exploded right under us in the form of The Matrix, a
brilliant experience that brought us into a world we had never
seen.<br /><br />I'll keep the plot overview simple, because to ruin the movie's big
surprises would be a shame, although I'm sure you already know the gist of
it. A haggard and frustrated computer programmer named Thomas Anderson, also
known by his online alias Neo, is awakened by a band of para-military
freedom fighters and their fatherly commander, Morpheus. What is he awakened
to? Reality, a horrifying reality that he can barely comprehend, but one
that he must quickly learn to live with.<br /><br />The sprawling plot is an expertly-forged epic of mythic proportions, and it
is directed and edited in a haunting way that perfectly shows off the cold
deadness of Neo's new reality. The Wachowski brothers have tapped into the
primal emotions that made the Star Wars saga such a success: Man, using his
cunning mind and heroic brawn, can rise up and rebel against evil and retake
his freedom.<br /><br />The kung-fu battles and gunfight sequences are without a doubt the finest
action scenes ever put onto film, and their mind-bending, over-the-top
coolness propels The Matrix far beyond anything that has ever come before
it; seeing Neo freeze time and watching Trinity spin weightlessly through
the air must simply be seen to be believed.<br /><br />All the acting here, along with the excellent writing and direction, is
flawless as well. Keanu Reeves is fantastic as Neo, and Laurence Fishbourne
is, as usual, exceptional as Neo's mentor Morpheus. All of the cast gives
great, sometimes career-making, performances as well; Carrie Anne-Moss as
Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the villainous Agent Smith especially
shine.<br /><br />Quite possibly the best action movie ever made, The Matrix is the type of
film that will inspire and influence the future of the science-fiction genre
for years to come.<br /><br />I give The Matrix a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to any and all fans of
film in general
