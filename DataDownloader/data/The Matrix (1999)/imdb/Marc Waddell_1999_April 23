Excellent film!  Highly recommended.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne
did an excellent job of portraying visionary rebels.  This film has
incredible special effects (go the the matrix website to see how they were
done).  This film takes about 30 minutes to take off, then it'll leave you
pinned to your seat.  Excellent work.
