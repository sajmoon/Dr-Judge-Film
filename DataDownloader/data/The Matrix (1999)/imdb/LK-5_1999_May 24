Yes, the Matrix manages to steal from all these sources and probably a
whole
bunch more that I missed. After taking elements from all these sources the
Wachowski brothers then add some well aged philosophy to the mix: the old
'brains in vats' idea. Well. Let's be charitable and say the Matrix is
very
postmodern. Just without much of the irony.<br /><br />Don't really be expecting any deep story telling - I didn't find it
particularly hard to follow, but it does lean on standard SF conventions
fairly heavily: if you're not really familiar with SF, locate the nearest
nerd
and drag him/her along with you to see it.<br /><br />It is worth seeing, even if the plot ain't Dickens - the FX are first
rate,
right from the very opening till the very last shot.
