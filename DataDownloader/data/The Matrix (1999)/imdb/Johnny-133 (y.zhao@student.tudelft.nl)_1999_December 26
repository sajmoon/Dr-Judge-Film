Martial art is not only a set of limb motion. Behind it there is an
intergrated philosophy, dealing with the relation between human and
nature,
between mind and body, between the contrast and switchness of positive and
negative, hardness and suppleness, exterial strength and internal
potential.
To be a real Kung Fu master, you have to be a philosopher.<br /><br />As a Chinese guy, I grow up with Hong Kong Kung Fu movie. Only a few of
them
reach this depth. So I had suspected any western director can perceive it.
I
was wrong. 'Matrix' do it, and do it brilliantly, though through a
different
way.
