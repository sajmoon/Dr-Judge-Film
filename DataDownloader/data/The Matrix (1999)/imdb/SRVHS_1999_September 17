<br /><br />The matrix was a good movie because it was twisted and had lots of wierd
speacil effects. One of the really cool effects was when these two guys were
shooting each other. It was cool because it made it look like every thing
was slowmow cuase they were moving so fast. Another thing about the movie
was it as confusing in a weird way. No other movie wil make you think like
this one.<br /><br />The thing that made this movie cool was the plot. The plot was that the
world was a computer program. Like nothing was real it was all a computer
fanticy. With out the computer you couldn't live a normal life. It says you
are not born by a mother you are grown like in a corn field.<br /><br />The other thing that made this move good was the speacil effects. I liked
them so much because they were a fat trip. One of the tripiest thinds was
when thet shoot at each other. That was cool because they could move so fast
they could doge the bullets. And when they did that every thing would get
all wavey and mest.<br /><br />In my conclution this movie was the bomb. It had every thing you want in a
action flick. Tripy stuff lots of shootig and agood looking chick in a tite
suit. So take my advise and go see the matrix and enjoy the
trip<br /><br />nick
