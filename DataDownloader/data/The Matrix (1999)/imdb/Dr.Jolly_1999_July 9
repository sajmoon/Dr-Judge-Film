1999_July 9 

If you asked me what my opinion of Keanu Reeves was five years ago, I
would've told you that he sucks. Now, thanks to the Devil's Advocate and
now
The Matrix, I think he's one of the most exciting actors in
Hollywood.
The Matrix is an incredible movie that will please all science fiction
fans along with action movie addicts. The best part of all is the fact
that
it also happens to be a great story that never drags and keeps you saying,
DAMN!!! Reeves does an excellent job as a computer hacker who finds out
that
he is the &quot;chosen one&quot; to free all human kind. Laurence Fishburn delivers
as
his mentor and whoever made those sunglasses for him to wear, deserves an
oscar nomination in costume design. Hugo Weaving is also a big part of
this
movie's success, playing a brilliant Agent Smith and is the coolest
looking
federal agent that I've seen in a long time.
The action is non-stop and the martial arts escapades are brilliantly
done. The story reminded me of the scare in the Terminator. In fact, that
may be the only flaw in the movie is that the script seems to be a slight
rip-off of the Terminator series and Dark City, both of which were better
movies. Still, I very much recommend this movie, because it is the best
movie that I have seen in 1999. I give it a 9 out of 10.
