I liked it ... A lot! very interesting, good action, excellent effects, and
a quality story.
If you have seen and liked Dark City, see this. If you have not; see
both.
Take that Philosophy class over again in two hours.
I would have ditched the Cinderella Kiss but that is the worst thing I can
think to say.
I will be seeing it again this weekend.
