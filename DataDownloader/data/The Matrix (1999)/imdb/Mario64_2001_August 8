The Matrix was a surprising delight of a movie. The story is deep and
interesting and it flows along well. The visuals are the best part of this
movie. It's great effects to the likes of which we really have never seen
before and are done in a way that's just fasinating. The characters are
mostly all played well, particularly Keanu Reaves who plays his best role
since Speed. The only downside to this movie is that in the end it really
never gives you any clear thought to what has really happened. Still I
really liked this movie and give it an 8 out of 10.
