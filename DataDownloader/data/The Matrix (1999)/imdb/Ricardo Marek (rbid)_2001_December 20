Great movie, The events on the movie provides you with a lot to thing about
it.(Are we real? or our mind is programmed to make us thing
real?)
- It is a science fiction movie that provides a good story to see.<br /><br />- It is an 'action' movie, with a lot of guns and effects.
- It is a 'cult' movie due that other movies and adv. tried to imitate
it.
- It is an 'actual' movie due that it presents the cyberspace current war:
software copyrights vs. hacking.<br /><br />It is one of the best science fiction movies I have seen.<br /><br />You should see it on a big screen, with a good sound otherwise you will be
missing a lot.
