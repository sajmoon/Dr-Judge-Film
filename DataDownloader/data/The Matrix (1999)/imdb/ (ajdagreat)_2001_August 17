What else can I say about this fabulous movie? What more is there to say?
This movie is very cool (even Keanu Reeves's very overrated acting ability
can't ruin it). <br /><br />The only additional thing I wanted to say was, if you are a parent wondering
if this movie is OK for your kid to see, go for it. I was wondering why this
film is rated R the whole time. I didn't catch one f-word, so this movie
must just be R for violence, which isn't that bad.
