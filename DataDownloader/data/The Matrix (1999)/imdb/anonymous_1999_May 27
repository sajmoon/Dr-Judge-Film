1999_May 27 

The Matrix was the type of movie that you 
wanted to get your popcorn and do all you 
needed to before the movie started. I 
loved this because there was the suspense 
and excitement that you would expect in 
this type of movie.
Just imagine if this was a true, and not a
movie. This would be a horrible  but 
the movie does tend to make you think.
This movie comes highly recommended to all
my friend and anybody who is thinking of 
seeing this for the first time.
