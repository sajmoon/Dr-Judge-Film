1999_May 21 

Of all the Sci-Fi movies I've seen over the years, and believe me I am
definitely a fan, this movie far surpasses any other.  I was amazed the
entire movie and continue to be amazed at the way this movie keeps you
interested the whole time, there isn't a dull moment in the movie.  I
think
Keanu Reeves outdid himself as compared to 'Jonny Mneumonic', which was
nonetheless a good movie but really didn't match up.  The story was kind
of
hard to grasp at first but by the end of the movie I was starting to
wonder
when they were gonna unplug me...hahaha.  I just saw Star Wars, and
believe
me, if you trying to decide between Star Wars and Matrix, definitelly see
the
Matrix!!! I give it a 10!!
