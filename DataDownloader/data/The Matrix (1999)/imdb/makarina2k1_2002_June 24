The film THE MATRIX, plays host to the vewers imagination. As a viewer for
the first time in 1999, i was pleased with what i had chosen to watch. Neo
(Keanu Reeves), is a computer hacker, and a heart-throb. Trinity, one of
the
leading hackers up til Neo's foundation, falls head over heels in love
with
him (not that i can blame her!)<br /><br />As the plot thickens, your mind as a viewer is nticed to expand, in order
to
follow with what is going on. Keeping myself still for longer than half an
hour can prove a task in itself, ut with sub-plots following the main plot
of the real world and Neo finding his true self, i was stuck to the
seat.<br /><br />Since watching this film for the first time on its day of release, i have
aquired the video, and recently the DVD also, making the total time of
watching this film 199 times!Tonight i will make it a good, round 200.<br /><br />For those who have not seen it, i will give you some advice, WATCH IT
PLEASE, ITS FAB!
