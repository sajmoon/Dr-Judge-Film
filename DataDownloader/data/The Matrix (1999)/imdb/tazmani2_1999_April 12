1999_April 12 

The movie was great.. You really need to follow the film closely..Don't get
up out of your sit for popcorn..You just might miss some of these Special
Effects that are incredibly believable. A well thought out film both special
effects and dialogue. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne both deliver great
performances along with Carrie-Anne. Be careful, it could get you thinking
about were and what we live in know..
Is it Real or Is it False..Our surroundings.. Find out what the word
&quot;Matrix&quot; means to their world. Are you one of the Chosen?
Computer and Sci-Fi Fans - it's a Must to See Movie.
