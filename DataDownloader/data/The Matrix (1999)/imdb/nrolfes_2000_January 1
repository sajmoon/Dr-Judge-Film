The mind-bending special effects alone make this movie worth watching. Just
as Industrial Lights and Magic changed the visual concept of sci-fi movies
with the Star Wars trilogy, THE MATRIX adds Bullet Time, a stunning new way
to move the perspective of the camera during a slow motion or time
compression or even a still frame shot, to film making. Above that THE
MATRIX is an action packed thriller starring that captures you from the
very
first scene and keeps you glued to your seat until the end. I predict that
it will reap quite a few Oscars at the next Academy Awards.
