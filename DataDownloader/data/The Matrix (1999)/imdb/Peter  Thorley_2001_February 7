The Matrix really is a mesmerising film- the first time you watch it, it
mesmerises you with its effects, great action sequences and brilliant
camera
work. It is well-deserving of the acclaim it has received for these. If it
it were based only on these, I would give the film 10/10.<br /><br />Yet looking at it closely, there are certain parts of it that ruin the
film
for me. First and foremost is the horrific dialogue, usually from Laurence
Fishburne. How much cryptic trash must he spout before he gets rid of all
those clich&eacute;s? It sometimes feels like a failed attempt to turn an action
film into a philosophical message!<br /><br />Not that the plot was bad though. It may have been taken from any number
of
movies, yet it was an interesting twist on the average action film. I
wouldn't call it the best sci-fi film ever, or the one from which all
others
must follow, but it is certainly well-thought out.<br /><br />I gave Matrix a 7 because, despite the interesting story, it still feels
like an attempt to make an action movie into something more intellectually
challenging. At first glance it is a very enjoyable and is very
impressive.
However it's appeal comes more from its action and stunts and really it
should have been left as that.
