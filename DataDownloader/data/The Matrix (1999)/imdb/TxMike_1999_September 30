1999_September 30 
December 2010 update. I just saw this on Blu-ray for the first time.
Simply marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the
best movie ever made. <br /><br />This is a review of &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; on DVD.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even
to own. For what it is, I give it a &#x22;10&#x22;. It kept me wide-eyed all the
way through. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be saying the same thing after my 20th
viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2005, and I have
seen it maybe 5 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie!) (Second
update: It is now 2007, I just saw it again and came away even more
impressed, especially when I compare it to the 1500 or so movies I have
seen since first viewing &#x27;The Matrix.&#x27; Truly and simply one of the best
and thought provoking movies ever made.)<br /><br />The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround
sound is quite thrilling. But, the &#x22;extra&#x22; features are a big reason to
buy the DVD.<br /><br />One &#x22;extra&#x22; is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while
the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own
reactions and explanations of various scenes.<br /><br />Another &#x22;extra&#x22; is playing the movie in normal mode where a white
rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene
was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will
take you to the &#x22;behind the scenes&#x22; shooting. Then the movie resumes.<br /><br />There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed.
Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.<br /><br />All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set
of &#x22;extras&#x22; I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn&#x27;t it amazing how much
stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of
music in its CD version!!
