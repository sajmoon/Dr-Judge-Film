The first time I saw The Matrix I was bored out of my life. But recently it
was advertised on cable and I couldn't help having another look. I was
absolutely breathtaken! I think this film has to be seen twice to be liked,
because now I agree with those who say The Matrix is one of the best science
fiction films of the century! It is smart, engaging, fun, action-packed and
thrilling entertainment that impressed the living daylights out of
me.<br /><br />The Matrix is a movie you just can't miss, so anyone who hasn't seen The
Matrix, see it now!<br /><br />Rating: 9
