Am i the only one who did not like this movie? First of all the plot(which
every one seems to get)i don't, cause really what was this movie about?
Once
again hollywood has put out so many special effects it overrides the
movie,
because that was most of the movie, special effects. And the only thing I
got out of  this garbage of a movie was that best line for Keanu Reeves
was
&quot;Whoa&quot;. In
conclusion, why not put your heart into a movie?
Please feel free to E-mail me with any questions or concerns in regard to
any movie.
