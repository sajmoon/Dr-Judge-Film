&#x22;The Matrix&#x22; has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this
movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene&#x27;s in space
with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies
that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; does
however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and
has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of
movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since
and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and
spectacular combination. From that perspective &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is one of
the most important movies for film-making, from the &#x27;90&#x27;s.<br /><br />This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski &#x27;brothers&#x27; were
obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that
style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and
flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also
look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were
something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this
movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie.
The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also
a refreshing one. It&#x27;s an extremely original movie, both story-wise and
technique-wise.<br /><br />Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The
fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all
is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some
fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from
Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most
certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and
also something totally new at times.<br /><br />The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is
fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times.
Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not
disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic
Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent
&#x27;villain&#x27; because of his look and way of acting.<br /><br />But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it&#x27;s
complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a
satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and
imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make
the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically
together.<br /><br />The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that
doesn&#x27;t even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening.
This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If
you don&#x27;t understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it
a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple
layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of
movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you
watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from
the &#x27;90&#x27;s and therefor also an absolute must-see!<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
