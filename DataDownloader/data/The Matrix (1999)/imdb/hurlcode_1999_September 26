1999_September 26 

I thought the plot was pretty straight forward and predictable. I still
thought it was a good story, just not too many unexpected twists and turns.
The special effects, and the imagination inherent in the story were what
sold this for me. I liked this enough I'd happily go out and buy a copy of
this movie. I saw it on the small screen - I'd say this would be awesome on
a movie screen.
