My only regret is not renting this movie earlier. I watched it 3 times the
first day, and I still couldn't get enough of it. The concept and
execution
are excellent, and so are the visual and sound effects. The story is well
developed and the action scenes superb. Only flaw is how Neo comes back
from
the dead.<br /><br />Watch this movie now!
