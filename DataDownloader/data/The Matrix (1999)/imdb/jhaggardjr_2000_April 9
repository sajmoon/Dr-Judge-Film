2000_April 9 

&quot;The Matrix&quot; is an excellent science-fiction/action movie that is truly
original. Superior special effects and splendid acting come together for an
entertaining show for two-plus hours. Keanu Reeves is very good in this
movie in the second best movie performance of his career (his best is
&quot;Speed&quot;). Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster,
and Joe Pantoliano are terrific too. The acting, effects, sound, and look of
the movie are impressive. This is one cool picture.
Winner of 4 Oscars: Film Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, and Visual
Effects. All well deserved.<br /><br />***1/2 (out of four)
