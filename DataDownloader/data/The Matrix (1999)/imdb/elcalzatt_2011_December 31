This is in my opinion one of the most overrated films ever. I
understand it revolutionized special effects but the rest of it is
fairly average. The story didn&#x27;t really get me. I understood it but I
just didn&#x27;t find it that interesting. Keanu Reeve&#x27;s acting is wooden as
hell and no one else stands out. The film is also quiet slow and not in
a good way it is an action movie and they should be fast paced. I think
there are much better action films like Inception and Die Hard. However
I think a lot of people will disagree with me but this is my review.
All in all not as good as I was hoping it would be it did however come
out in a good year for films. Films from 1999 that I think are good are
American Beauty, The Blair Witch Project and of course Fight Club.
