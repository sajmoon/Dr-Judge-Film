1999_June 27 

This is my first Wachowski movie and have to say i was stunned
by this truly incredible adventure.The first rate effects
and
passable performances from Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne
make for a film which will surely hit Star Wars episode 1
quite
hard in the box office.
Furthermore , this is a film which really does engage the mind ,
unlike the previous summer blockbusters , Godzilla , Armageddon
and the like.These films are enjoyable enough in their way
but
with the Matrix it really does force you to consider some
pretty
mind blowing concepts.Bring on Matrix 2 , i can`t wait ,Messrs Wachowski ,
PLEASE , PLEASE , PLEASE!!.
