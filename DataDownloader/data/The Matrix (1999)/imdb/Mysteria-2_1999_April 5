1999_April 5 

I was expecting The Matrix to be a two hour special effects show, something
I wasn't exactly opposed to (I love special effects).  But I found it
instead to be an excellently put-together intellectual film, with plenty of
twists to keep your mind whirling.  I truly enjoyed it, and I'll be sure to
see it again!
