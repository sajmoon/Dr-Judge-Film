1999_April 27 

This movie was excellent.  I was blown away by the effects and the plot.
The actors were top notch, even Keanu.  I think this is one of the three
roles I thought he was good in, the other two being his role in the
Devil's
Advocate and his role of a stoner in Love You to Death.  Lawrence
Fishburne
finally gets a role he deserves, I think he's underappreciated in his
roles.
So he's kinda got bad teeth, so did Austin Powers.  Trinity was YUMMY and
the villains were evil.  The fighting scenes were really cool.
