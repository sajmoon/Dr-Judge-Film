I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride
a minute movie, The Matrix, last night. I have to say that as writers the
two brothers are very good Directors.
	The story is fairly straightforward. It seems that our reality is not
really our reality but a computer generated one and the year is somewhere
close to 2200. The computers harvest babies and use them as giant batteries
to keep the computer generated world running as they see fit. A few special
people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle
against the computers. One group, led by Morpheus, is searching for the
mythical &quot;One&quot;. A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own
strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once
existed. Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo. The
rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in
their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the
computer.
	The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going.
Unfortunately nothing truly spectacular occurs in any of these sequences. I
am not saying they were bad there have just been better sequences in many
other movies.
  For the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been
given. Laurence Fishburn tackles the role of Morpheus and gives the
performance we have come to expect from him. He is able to draw attention to
himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps
itself around you and transports you away with its power. Carrie-Ann Moss
plays Trinity. She is, in a word, BAD...and that's good. It has been a long
time since we have seen quite as tough a woman in film. Ripley would be
proud of her.
	Now we come to Neo. Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero
before. This time he is passable but that is all. Some scenes, like when he
walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great. Other
scenes don't work as well. His acting ability has frequently been in
question and this is one of those times. The first half of the movie his
dazed expression is completely befitting of a character who is bombarded
with the information he is receiving. Unfortunately that expression stays on
him the rest of the movie. Remember my comments concerning the power of
Fishburn's voice? Keanu is not blessed with the same gift. In fact at all
times he sounds as if he is stoned beyond belief. 
Though the story is silly and meanders off on different tangents I am not
saying I disliked this movie. I will say that it wasn't the be all and end
all of Sci-Fi/Action movies. However it was relatively entertaining and I am
not sorry I went.
