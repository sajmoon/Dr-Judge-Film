These days, with all the loud, intense marketing that accompanies major
movies, it's sometimes difficult to separate the film from the hype. 'The
Matrix', however, is one film that is even bigger and better than the hype
that tries to sell it.<br /><br />It's rare these days to find movies with no plot holes, no plot flaws. Even
with the recent improvements in SFX and CGI, it's rare to find a movie
where
the effects just cannot be flawed (well, on freeze-frame I actually found a
bungee cord that the wore-removal guys didn't do such a good job
on).<br /><br />The Matrix not only lives up to it's promise, but far exceeds it. It
redefines excitement.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving is a much under-utilised actor, one of Australia's best. It's
good to see Australian actors like Russell Crow and Guy Pearce getting the
attention and plaudits they deserve, but Hugo Weaving should be working
more. Whilst he is superb here as the evil and emotionless villain, check
out some of his previous Australian miniseries ('Dirtwater Dynasty' and
'Bodyline') to see him really shine.
