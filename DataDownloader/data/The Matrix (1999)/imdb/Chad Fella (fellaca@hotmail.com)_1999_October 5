1999_October 5 

After watching this movie I wanted to run on the walls (literally).  It
was
a flashy techno-drama with great special effects.  The story kept me
interested, and the acting was good.  I would place this in the
&quot;first-run&quot;
category, meaning get out there and see it in the theatres.
