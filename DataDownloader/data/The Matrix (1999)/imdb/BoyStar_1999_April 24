1999_April 24 

This is truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It's been
what seems like forever since a mainstream production has been so artistic
and yet so able to capture everything that makes a good movie interesting.
All the action, drama, and especially the visual effects are astounding.
The only drawback is the fact that Keanu Reeves plays the character of Neo
which is the film's focus.  If Keanu knew how to act instead of just playing
himself as every role he's ever done then this film would be ever better,
which is hard to imagine.  Another wonderful feature of this movie is that
it has a full and interesting plot.  Unlike most films of the recent past,
the storyline not only builds through out the movie but it also comes to a
very well done conclusion.  The Matrix is definitely an instant classic in
the sci-fi genre.  See this film...then see it again...and again...and
again...
