1999_June 3 

The first time I saw The Matrix, on opening night, I entered the theater
with no expectations.  I had seen its commercial during the Superbowl, and
all I knew was that it starred Keanu Reeves and some really cool-looking
effects.  Even though the people behind me were having a loud, in-depth
conversation, it didn't bother me.  I thought, &quot;I came here to watch some
cool effects, not listen to the story.&quot;  I was not disappointed.  I was so
dazzled by the look of the movie, that I didn't even notice that it
actually
had a story.  I came home and told my friends, &quot;Sure, it has no plot, but
it's definitely worth seeing.&quot;  I was unenlightened.<br /><br />Over the next few days, my husband kept bringing up ideas that were
explored
in the movie, biblical, literary, and cinematic references, etc, and I
realized that I needed to see it again.  The second time, I experienced
it,
rather than just watched it.  I was enthralled.  Now I feel compelled to
see
it again about once a week, saying, &quot;I've got to see it one more time
before
it leaves the theaters for good!&quot;  I'm up to 4 viewings now, seeing
something new every time.
