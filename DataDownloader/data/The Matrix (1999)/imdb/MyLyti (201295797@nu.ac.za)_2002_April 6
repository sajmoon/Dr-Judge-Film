The Matrix was a very good, original film, but thats all. People go on by
saying that it is an &quot;absolute classic&quot; &quot;one of the greatest films ever&quot;
&quot;unbeatable&quot;. Its all just a lot of undeserved praise. People took the film
too seriously - leading to the formation of cult groups on the net and all
over the world.<br /><br />I recommend that people watch this movie, bearing in mind that it is just a
movie. If you want to watch some truly &quot;amazing&quot;, original films, consider
The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and Gattaca.<br /><br />8/10
