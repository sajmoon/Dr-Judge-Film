The Matrix has gained a hard core following of people sucked into its
visually stylish world of paranoia and false realities. Yes were in Philip K
Dick (lite) world again.  The effects are great, the cast look good so it is
a shame that the script is afraid to venture into the darker corridors that
the film always seems about to (but never does) enter. An enjoyable if
unsatisfying entertainment
