&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a highly enjoyable film and in my opinion one of the best
I
have seen. As sci-fi it does the genre justice but what sets it apart is
the
inventive style of film-making and the innovative techniques used.
However,
the emotion depth to it is limited and a little glossy, but as a piece of
entertainment it is first class and a must-see.
