When i first saw The Matrix, it reminded me of some books i once read.
These
books were Dune, Magician and some obscure cyberpunk novel without a
name...<br /><br />I was thrilled by the action-packed shots of the action
scenes,
but what astonished me most was the supreme mix of cyberpunk,
fantasy, science-fiction and of course surrealism. As a
cyberpunk/surrealistic movie it definitely kicks ass... (i especially liked
the d&eacute;ja-vu thing, as it gave a nice view on &quot;reality&quot; in &quot;The
Matrix-world&quot;)
The way the &quot;real world&quot; and &quot;The Matrix-world&quot; are intermixed and
intertwined with each other was just f***cking great! If you get shot in
The
Matrix, you'll die in the outside world and vice versa...<br /><br />The whole concept of the movie is steady as rock, as a &quot;director&quot; myself,
i'd like to see the script...<br /><br />This is definitely one of those movies which shouldn't be sequelled...it
could only get worse...<br /><br />P.S. Great effects!
