1999_April 12 

An intelligent action movie. Stylish and thought-provoking. If you go to
see
it for the special effects, you'll be intrigued by the premise. At times
it
feels a lot like The Terminator, but the plot is not really that similar.
However this film is also likely to become a cult classic too. Overall an
immensely satisfying cinema experience.
