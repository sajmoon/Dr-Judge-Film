I really liked the Matrix when I first saw it but have changed my opinions
since seeing it a number of times since. I really don't think I could sit
through it ever again, there is only so much you can get out of people in
sunglasses doing cartwheels while firing two Uzis at the same time. What
really p*sses me off is when people go 'oh it's sooo confuing, it's just
soo
intelligent, the story is just sooooooo mind-boggling!' YEAH RIGHT! It's
not
like you need to be Albert-feckin'-Einstein to work it out!! The acting is
unbelievably corny and whenever the script calls for any real emotion
(which
doesnt happen often in this music video.. oh sorry .. film) the actors
arent
upto it. Unless it gets amazing reviews then I will not be going to see the
sequel- save your money for Star Wars Episode 2 and The Two Towers (lord of
the rings part2).
p.s- and the effects aren't all that.
