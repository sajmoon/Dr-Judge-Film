&quot;The Matrix&quot; is the driving force behind a string of half-arsed
sci-fi/fantasy films (including 2 bloated and inferior Matrix sequels)
that have appeared (and sunk without trace) in its wake since 1999.
This film had a similar cultural impact to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; and
its high rating is well deserved. Often imitated but seldom equaled,
&quot;The Matrix&quot; set so many new standards that it became sci-fi&#39;s
yardstick for the new millennium. <br /><br />It has that potent blend of action, adventure, philosophy and sex
appeal that distinguishes a classic blockbuster movie from all the
summer season also-rans. Name me one other big-hitting action movie
from 1999. You&#39;re struggling, aren&#39;t you?<br /><br />Of course you are. &quot;The Matrix&quot; was one of the first films to use
&quot;Bullet Time&quot; camera effects in its gravity-defying slow-motion stunts.
The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a
Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy
tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead
spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes.
The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the
figure-hugging shiny black PVC?<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to
capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the
formulaic sequels haven&#39;t dimmed the appeal of the original film.
