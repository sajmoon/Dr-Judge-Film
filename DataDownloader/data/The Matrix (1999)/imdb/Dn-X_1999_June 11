1999_June 11 

What an excellent film - now where do I begin? First of all, the direction
and camera work was extremely well done - the changes from slo-mo and back
work very well. The story is good, entertaining, and insightful. But, I
hear
you say, what about Keanu Reeves? The man can't act! Well, I wasn't even
thinking about Johnny Mnemonic, but it doesn't matter because he helps the
film superbly. The action sequences are great, but the fight scenes are
just
mindblowing. A great film, go see it now.
