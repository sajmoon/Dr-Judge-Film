I'm probably too old, but to me this was nothing more than a Karate-movie
from the 80's that had entered the cyber-era. Ok, they tried to convey some
kind of &quot;deeper meaning&quot;, but is was not clear enough and drowned in all the
explosions and special effect. The idea behind the movie is excellent, too
bad they spent all their budget on crash-boom-bang instead of a good
script.<br /><br />However,  a display of state-of-the-art special effects it was
excellent.
