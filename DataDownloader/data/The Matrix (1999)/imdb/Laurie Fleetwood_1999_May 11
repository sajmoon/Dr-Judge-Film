1999_May 11 

This is the best film I have ever seen. It has wonderful action sequences,
wonderful actors, and the writers/directors (Wachowski brothers) pulled it
off extremely well. They definitely used their imaginations on this film
and
that's what I like about this movie. It's so unreal. It kinda plays games
with your mind. It's a fantastic movie. It's got a love story woven into
it,
but nothing really big.
Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss really make the action scenes awesome.<br /><br />This film is just bigger than anything I've ever seen.<br /><br />And as for the action scenes, it nothing bad. This movie doesn't have any
kind of bad messages for teens. It really doesn't have any message, it's
just a really cool flick! I recommend it 100 %.
