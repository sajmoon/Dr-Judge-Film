1999_June 16 

T2? Total Recall? This was just the beginning. Now a new era hits the
movie-world! THE MATRIX has the best FX-shots I've EVER seen..and I've
seen
lots of movies. Reeves, well...I think SPEED is crap and BMs DRACULA isn't
very cool neither...I liked Johnny Mnemonic but it's trash of course,
BUT this movie is just amazing and Reeves is just PERFECT for it!
(so are Laurence Fishburn and Carrie Ann Moss). The cool thing about the
effects is that you don't see that it's compter animated! Sometimes you
are
not sure if it was a hard stunt or a night in front of the computer, no
joke.
This movies isn't boring for 1 second and I'm bored very
fast.<br /><br />There are some things in the story I didn't get....but I'll go to see it
for
a 2nd time....maybe I'll get more. (For the ones who saw it: Where the
heck
Agent Smith wants to escape to??)
And there is also 1 unlogical thing in it (for the ones who saw it: In the
beginning when they want to arrest Trinity, why the Agents don't go into
the
bodies of the police men?)<br /><br />But anyway: Perfect 10/10 (was long time ago that i had this much fun in a
movie theater)
