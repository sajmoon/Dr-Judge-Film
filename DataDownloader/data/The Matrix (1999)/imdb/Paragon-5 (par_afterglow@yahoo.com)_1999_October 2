1999_October 2 

Reality in the &quot;real&quot; world seems to be just as uncertain and confusing as
The Matrix.  It was a movie that made me think of how closed one's eyes
could be to the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.  We are often so
content living in our comfortable little lives, that we seldom take note of
the little things that are quite out of place.  And when these &quot;anomalies&quot;
do cross our paths, we tend to either ignore it or write it off as mistaken
perception.  The Matrix reminded me that I too would rather take the Red
capsule and open my eyes to a world that seems so impossible, yet is the
truth of what is out there, and more often than not, in
here...
