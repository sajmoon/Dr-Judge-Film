This is the best Sci-Fi flic since Aliens. An absolute must on DVD, simply
because the special effects are fantastic. For the action, blow-em up
smash-em up lovers, it has everything you ever want. However, what makes
this movie exceptional is the actual answer to the question, what is the
Matrix? The Matrix is conceptually, one of the smartest ideas in Sci-Fi in
years. <br /><br />Keaneu Reeves has often been accused of being one dimensional. Well, if that
is true, this is the dimension that all of the critics speak of. He's
perfect for this movie, as are the rest of the cast. 
Fishbourne is brilliant and Carrie-Ann Moss very sexy. However, the most
effective actor in this movie is Australian, Hugo Weaving. Weaving plays the
villain , with a great blend of intelligence and indestructibility that
makes you wonder how or even if he can be defeated.<br /><br />This is one of those Sci-Fi action movies that gets better the next time you
see it. I have seen it twice and I'm sure I'll see it again and enjoy it
even more.
