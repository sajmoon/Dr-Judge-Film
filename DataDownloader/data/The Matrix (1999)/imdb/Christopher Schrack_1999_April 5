1999_April 5 

This film is one of the best I have seen!  I had no idea that Andy
Wachowski
and Larry Wachowski could make such high-quality sci-fi cinema!  Not only
does The Matrix have a truly inventive plot and amazing special effects,
but it has other factors that make it so good.  One of the things few
people
might not notice is their (the film makers') great attention to detail,
especially in reflections!  There are times when there are close-ups of
Lawrence Fishburne and when he looks directly at the camera, you don't see
crew, camera, equipment or anything.  Another aspect that makes this film
such a marvel is the great usage of slow motion.  One of the best scenes
in
the whole movie is when Neo and Trinity are shooting the SWAT team in the
limestone corridor of a skyscraper.  The brilliant slow motion shows
debris
flying everywhere and really makes you feel like you are part of the
action.<br /><br />This is the first film in a long time where I have seen the audience clap
at
a scene! Action, drama, sci-fi, comedy, and even
romance is in this movie.  The Matrix has it all.  If you haven't seen it,
you haven't lived.
