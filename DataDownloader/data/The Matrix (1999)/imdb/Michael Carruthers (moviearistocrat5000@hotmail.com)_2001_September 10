THE MATRIX (1999)
Rating: 9/10<br /><br />The Matrix has all the potential and more to become an action classic &#150;
fantastic story, a star-studded cast, heaps of memorable quotes,
boom-blasting award winning sound and a kick-ass techno soundtrack. But, it
has also has something most other action movies nowadays don't have, it's
smart and it doesn't forget about proper plot points quickly, leaving no
stones unturned, no questions unanswered. The Matrix has no plot holes and
after all the explaining, it's straight into the kick-ass action! The film's
visual side is more effective than it's screenplay, bringing to life bold
visuals, stunning cinematography and tight editing, but the scripting is
still very effective and quickly paced although slightly corny at times. And
did I mention the fight scenes? Wow! I have never seen any martial arts like
this before. The best fight scenes are Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves
challenging each other in kung fu and that unforgettable scene when Neo
(Reeves) dodges that bullet and the camera swerves a complete 360. Those
Wachowski's are master-workers! All in all, The Matrix is a gripping, tense
and amazing movie to watch. A simple verdict is: the more you see it, the
more it ROCKS!
