2000_October 26 

This was a movie I wasn't going to see until friends talked me into it.<br /><br />The story was interesting especially the many analogies one can find in
it.
If you take it too seriously it is a load of rubbish, but if you think
about
concepts and analogies there is a lot of thoughtful statements being made
in
this movie.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good especially &quot;Orpheus&quot;.<br /><br />If it had not been for the many blasphemies scattered throughout the movie
I
would have rated it more highly. I still think it is one of those movies
that are worth seeing even if you aren't into science fiction.
