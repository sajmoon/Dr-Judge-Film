1999_April 7 

It is really a shame that the talented Wachowski brothers did not spend
more
time paring down the sprawling, unwieldy, and ultimately confusing and
unsatisfying plot threads of The Matrix and settle in on one.  Had they
found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes
dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects
would have seemed even more special.  A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to
Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of
an
idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds
surrogates
for Christ, Judas, etc.  Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the
Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the
underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance
of
his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition
of
one-note, wooden bad guys.
