what a great movie...it was so good it overshadowed Keanu's acting and I
didn't even notice how bad it was...(I'm assuming it was, couldn't tell ya
fer sure!)<br /><br />the visual effects were like nothing I've ever seen...The storyline was
very
original and I actually found myself, quite literally, &quot;on the edge of my
seat&quot; towards the end...<br /><br />holy moley what a film!
