1999_April 27 

Everyone seems to love this movie. I don't get why. There are gaping plot
holes, horrible acting and dialogue, and it rips off Star Wars in the
whole
manipulation of the Matrix/Force. It was very cool, and entertaining if
you
don't think about it too much, but really that's all that can be said for
it.
