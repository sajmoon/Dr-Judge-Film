1999_April 14 

First I was going to watch Twin Dragon, but the theathre which played the
movie wasn't playing any movies and the time. And so I decide to watch The
Matrix, And I am very glad that I didn't see Twin Dragon, because Matrix
was so
awesome,and the fighting scene is just wicked. I saw the movie like 12
times, and I will never get tired of it.
