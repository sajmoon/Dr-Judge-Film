1999_April 16 

This is a classic movie - a beautiful and powerful movie.  There is so much
packed into it, that I had to see it twice in a week.  It is a unique
success!<br /><br />You can enjoy it as an action-film, or as a serious SF drama, or as a
graduate course in philosophy and literature.  It is densely packed with
ideas and questions as to the meaning of &quot;reality&quot;.  Of all the SF films I
have seen in the last 50 years, I have to put this one in the top 10.<br /><br />Yes, it is a complicated story and, yes, you have to pay attention, but it
is all tied logically together.  The fight scenes are choreographed as
beautifully as a ballet. (The actors trained for 4 months just to ensure
that they used the minimum amount of fight doubles.)  The special effects
are seamless and greatly enhance the story.   The enemy forces lead by Agent
Smith (Hugo Weaving) are fascinating, dangerous, and remorseless.  All
actors hit their marks and deliver.<br /><br />It is a &quot;dense&quot; movie with many layers and literary and cultural allusions.
Example, Neo (Keanu) apartment number is 101.  That is the same room number
used in Orwell's 1984 in which Winston Smith faces his worst fears and is
broken.<br /><br />Don't miss it - or you will never get free of the Matrix! <br /><br />
