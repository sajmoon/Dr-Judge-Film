This movie was extremely well written, with a plot line that could almost
seem believable.  Reeves has a great performance mostly due to the
casting,
which called for a clue-less heroic, that Reeves is very good at.  The
special effects were one of the best portion of this film, they were
visually great and revolutionary to the industry.  One of my favorite
things
about the making of this film is that the martial arts scenes were not
complete acting.  I loved that the actors were schooled for about 2 months
to make it much more believable.  The music throughout the film was also
great, being hip and exciting.  Overall I loved this film and cannot see
it
too many times.
