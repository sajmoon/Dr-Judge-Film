I saw &quot;The Matrix&quot; in the theatres when it first came out, forgot all about
it, then saw it again a few weeks ago. I think maybe it takes a third or
fourth viewing to begin to understand this?<br /><br />What's up with the whole &quot;Matrix&quot; thing anyway? I think that was the main
fault in the entire film (besides Reeve's awful acting and obvious lack of
anything upstairs) which was that all of us who don't speak Techy - you
know, that alien language computer geeks use - don't have a clue what's
going on. OR, we do, but don't understand WHY.<br /><br />The special FX were pretty cool, but I was so confused, I couldn't pay
attention to half of them. Think I'll rent the DVD today. All in all, a
decent movie with some good acting and a very cool plot (I think).
:o)
