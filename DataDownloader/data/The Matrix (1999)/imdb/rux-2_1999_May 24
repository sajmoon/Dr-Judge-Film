1999_May 24 

It is hard...I have seen this movie twice already...but is not enough, I
wanna buy it, and belive me, you will wanna buy it too.
What really is the MATRIX? Anybody knows? This are only two questions
but
wait `till you see the movie. You`ll have soooo many questions, than
you`ll
not be able to sleep...what`s more, it ( the thoughts )will make you get
out
your bed, get on top of a building, and jump on the next building...OK, I
know, I am going a little too far, but you watch the movie, YOU WILL
question everything and everybody...
Anyway, Keanu is playing as a hacker, and there are some scenes in the
movie that makes you recall &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;...but, Keanu soon realizes
that everything and everybody that sourrounds him is ...not real!
whoa...it
is not an everyday kinda deal...What`s more, he finds out that he is the
so
called &quot;choosen one&quot; to save the world...Save it from what?...or from
whom?...Well, I am not here to tell you the whole story, but one thing is
for sure: you will love this movie, the story, the fights, the special
effects...just give it a chance!
As far as I am concerned, this movie deserves 10 out of 10...go see it,
go buy it but don`t miss it !!!
