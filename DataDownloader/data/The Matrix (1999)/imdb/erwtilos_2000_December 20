if I had to choose the best film ever, that would definitely be THE
MATRIX.
It's the only film I've ever seen that combines astonishing
scenario,fantastic visual effects,action and a promising end which is very
important for a film to be successful.
The plot puts your mind into a lot of thinking about the real world and
really gets you in Neo's shoes.
Once you start watching the film, you won't be able  to think anything
else
but THE MATRIX for many many many hours (even after the movie
ends!).
