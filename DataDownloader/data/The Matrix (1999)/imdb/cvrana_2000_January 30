When I saw &quot;The Matrix&quot; I didn't have big expectations for it, and I
was right.  This confused and weak-plotted movie has got to be one of the
dumbest ever made.  It made me sick.  It was so corny I wanted to scream.
I
think that the only reason people like this junk is because they think
that
the thought of the matrix is really interesting and clever, it's not.
It's
an excuse to use special effects (that weren't even that great).<br /><br />People need to get a little taste before they call a movie &quot;their
favorite movie ever.&quot;
