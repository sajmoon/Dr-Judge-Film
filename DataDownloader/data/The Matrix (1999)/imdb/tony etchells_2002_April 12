After every critic in the world heaped froth-at-the-mouth praise on this
&quot;masterpiece&quot; I was eager to see it when it came out.  I knew I was going
to
hate it with a vengeance very quickly.<br /><br />So the cosy world we live in is all an illusion?  Personally I'll take the
illusion anytime if the alternative is living in a pot of hair
gel.<br /><br />The effects, ladies and gentlemen, are terrible.  I've seen better on
commercials (and most of them I had done before this was made). The acting
is peurile - Keanu Reeves is a totem pole, Carrie-Anne Moss is cheerless
and
charmless, Hugo Weaving is more convincing in a dress.<br /><br />&quot;But it's so cool&quot; I hear you protest. Because Keanu says &quot;whoa&quot; and wears
shades? Because Carrie-Anne Moss is a babe (to spotty teenagers)? Because
Lawrence Fishburne spouts some incomprehensible Morgan Freemanesque pearls
of wisdom?  Because there are lots of guns and fights for absolutely no
reason whatsoever? Think about it for a minute and you'll realise you're
being manipulated far more than the human race in this
film.<br /><br />
