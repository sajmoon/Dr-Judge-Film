1999_June 18 

A visually stunning romp around a virtual reality 1999 juxtaposed into a
post-apocalyptic 23C controlled by artificial intelligence and their
'agents' and machines.<br /><br />Not an original story and one that is traditionally hard to maintain a
sufficient suspension of disbelief but in The Matrix it is superbly done
by
letting you hover on the edge of surrealism before smacking you in the
eyes
with superb special effects.<br /><br />One of the most appealing things to me was the virtual
wardrobes!<br /><br />
