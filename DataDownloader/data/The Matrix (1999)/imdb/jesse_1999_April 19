1999_April 19 

Confusing script, unless you want to sit through it three times, and action
scenes, contrary to previous comments, that you have not seen this type
action  scenes before. really.  How about the helicopter shootout scene at
the skyscraper, remember True Lies, How about the acrobatic amazonic
feminist fighting off the enemy, remember the fifth Element, the dark moody
themed art direction, remember Batman, Dark City, Blade Runner, and how
about the silly script, He is the one, He is the One,  etc etc.  Joel Silver
and how many respectable critics are trying to sell this one.  Not to this
guy.  It is a B- at best.  The acting is fine by Fishburne and Weaving, and
the soundtrack and dazzling imagery does make up for some of the often seen
scenes in other movies.  Enough Said.  On to Star Wars where we probably can
expect the same.
