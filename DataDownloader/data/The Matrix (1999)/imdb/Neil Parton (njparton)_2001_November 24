If you want to see just HOW good your home cinema setup is then this is the
definitive movie to try on DVD. The visuals aren't &quot;bad&quot; either!! This is
the very first movie I tried with my Dolby Digital surround sound system
and
it certainly didn't disappoint. I still haven't found anything that will
even come close to matching it.
