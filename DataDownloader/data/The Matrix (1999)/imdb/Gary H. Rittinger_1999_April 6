1999_April 6 

Absolutely amazing! This film definitely kept me glued to my seat and I
NEVER looked at my watch. The storyline was cohesive and very well done.
Plot turn after plot turn!<br /><br />You really can't get too much info or it will spoil the story ending for
you. You really can't guess too much of what is ahead as you are basically
only getting the main character's point of view. Keanu Reeves did an
outstanding job! All of the actors were excellent. Laurence Fishburne
(Morpheus) added great depth.<br /><br />The digitized effects were very clean and thorough. Definitely worth the
price of admission.
