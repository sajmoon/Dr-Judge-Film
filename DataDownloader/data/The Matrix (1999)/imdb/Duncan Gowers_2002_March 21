A welcome addition to the pantheon of revered science fiction movies, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; is already a modern classic.  Made at the tail end of the 20th
century it's a meshing of genres, with a vice-tight storyline and script
and
an abundance of amazing special effects.  It separates itself from the slew
of recent science fiction thanks to its adhesion and capability to portray
one of the more original takes on a post-apocalyptic netherworld, where man
is not in control of his destiny, but is controlled by machines &#150; another
example of man creating his own destruction.<br /><br />The most striking aspect of the &quot;The Matrix&quot; is its amazing pacing.
Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski, who both wrote and directed the film,
obviously take their cue from comic books.  Such is the narrative
structure,
the film reads like a graphic novel.  Its composition is made of a great
number of close ups, emphasising the emotional toll of something that is
unexplainable, something like the Matrix.  When the attention isn't placed
on the characters, the vista opens up to amazing special effects and action
sequences.  The Wachowski brothers pull back and let the action flow,
generally in slow motion.  You could be mistaken for reading it as a comic,
soaking up every piece of design and production in the
frame.<br /><br />Like so many other comic book style films and stories, the core character
of
&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a superhero, a man who will save mankind.  No one knows
exactly who he is, until one day, his cover is removed.  Neo (Keanu
Reeves),
aka Thomas Anderson, could be the one, but all we have to go on to know
this
is the prophecy of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne).  Morpheus is the leader
of a ragtag bunch of human resistance fighters.  Their battle is against
the
machines, who breed humans for their energy, which in turn powers the
machines in their domination of the remnance of Earth.  The world in which
we exist is nothing more than a computer programme, designed to pacify our
souls as we are drained for power, much like a battery.<br /><br />Neo, who lives his double life as software programmer by day, hacker
extraordinaire by night, has always felt his life is different to everyone
else's.  He's been intrigued by finding out just what the Matrix is.  Where
he got the original knowledge of the concept of the Matrix is unknown &#150;
it's
almost as if he knows by osmosis.<br /><br />His suspicions are confirmed when it all coalesces in a short space of
time.
Neo's life as Anderson is removed.  Morpheus is revealed to Neo by Trinity
(Carrie Ann Moss), a beautiful heroine and messenger.  When he is finally
introduced to Morpheus his journey into the &#145;real' world and out of the
Matrix begins.  It's a thrilling ride that combines a number of classic
&#145;cool' movie themes, including martial arts, action and sci-fi paranoia to
name a few.<br /><br />Morpheus is presented as a Zen-like, Yoda-style sensei.  He speaks in
contradictions and double meanings.  &quot;Don't think you can hit me, know you
can,&quot; he says when training Neo in martial arts.  The way in which Neo
&#145;learns' is a slight copout.  All his newly acquired knowledge is planted
into his brain via computer.  While he may be the saviour of mankind
against
the tyranny of the machines, his intelligence is &#145;programmed' via a hook-up
to his brain.  In that sense Neo becomes artificial intelligence as he has
not learnt his craft but has been programmed with it.<br /><br />This aside Morpheus trains Neo to remove himself from his human vessel, to
become more of a spirit that can transcend his earthly cadaver.  Neo (an
acronym for One, aka The One?) becomes a Bruce Lee style action superhero,
complete with an arsenal that would befit two Arnold Schwarzeneggers.  His
main enemies are Sentient Agents &#150; created by the machines to travel in and
out of the Matrix to destroy the earthly Neo as Thomas Anderson.  When they
fail and Morpheus' training of Neo begins, the Agents (led by Australian
actor Hugo Weaving) realise their task has become a great deal more
difficult.  It all results in some amazing action sequences of special
effects and bullets that make for an effective and uplifting
ending.<br /><br />Science fiction angle aside, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has enough to please everyone.
Its subplots include romance, a little comedy, social commentary and a
great
deal of action.  It draws on a number of similar films such as &quot;Zardoz&quot; and
&quot;The Terminator&quot;.  Once again, it befits the sprawling nature of a comic
book, touching different nerves when needed within the narrative.<br /><br />The special effects are brilliant and far outdo the efforts of George
Lucas'
&quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace&quot;, which was released the same year.  While
Lucas' film was created to almost look unreal &#150; far too fantastic to be
believable &#150; &quot;The Matrix&quot; is more plausible, if a science fiction film of
this ilk can be believable.  The fluidity and positioning of the effects
works because we do not have to convince ourselves we are in what we are
witnessing.  Costume design borders on S&amp;M, with its black leather and
synthetics perhaps touching on some underlying sexual overtones the film
seems reluctant or unable to pursue.<br /><br />The acting, whilst not the focal point of the film, is strong enough.
Reeves is effective, Moss credible and Fishbourne majestic.  Weaving's
Agent
Smith is an odd but suitably evil character and sports possibly the most
cosmopolitan accent I have ever heard.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; was a huge hit on release and has subsequently dominated VHS
and DVD charts around the world since.  Its combination of sheer
entertainment and an in depth (if slightly diluted for the screen) story is
enough to keep all audiences happy, from popcorn munching teens, nerdy
sci-fi fanatics to the film enthusiast.  &quot;The Matrix Reborn&quot; will be an
interesting concept upon release in 2003 and we await to see if it matches
the originality and progressive nature of its accomplished
prequel.<br /><br />
