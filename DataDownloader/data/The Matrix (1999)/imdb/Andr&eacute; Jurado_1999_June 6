1999_June 6 

It could be a bit confusing sometimes, but once you figure it out, it's
pure
fun. Even if you don't understand the plot, it's still fun! A plot, which
by
the way, is wonderfully created. What a great story that is! The movie is
full of special efects and action, there's no way you can go wrong on this
one! It has a good cast and the directors... no comments! It's also
worthwhile checking out &quot;The Bond&quot; thriller from the two brothers
directors.
