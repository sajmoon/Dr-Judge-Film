1999_April 4 

First allow me to explain that I had no intention of EVER watching this
film.  I try to avoid Keanu Reeves' movies if possible.  He is not one of my
favorite actors.  In fact, he is one of my least favorite.  The trailers for
The Matrix were horrible.  In a nutshell, they invited you to see the movie
for the great special effects.  Whoopeee!!  I hate it when movies rely
heavily on one thing to drive the story.  Be it special effects, explosions,
sap, whatever, that is not enough to make me enjoy the film.  Sure, Star
Wars had some of the best special effects of its time but it is the story
everyone loves.  The only reason I agreed to watch The Matrix is because a
friend really wanted to see it and offered to pay my way.<br /><br />This is a good movie.  The fight scenes are very well done.  The effects are
as awesome as advertised.  Keanu Reeves does an adequate job.  And I am a
big fan of Laurence Fishburne.  What did it for me, though, was the
background story to the film.  It was an interesting concept and even
moderately believable.  Overall, this is a very solidly done movie, one I
would recommend.
