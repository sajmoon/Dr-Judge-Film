1999_April 12 

I got dragged to the Matrix by some friends.  I wasn't really gung ho
about
seeing it because the previews didn't make it look like a movie I would
like
to see.  I must admit that when I was watching the movie I was definitely
pleasantly surprised by the movie.  The plot was intricate and kept my
mind
occupied, while the special effects dazzled the eye.  I believe it was
worth
seeing and will probably see it again.  Keanu Reeves delivers probably his
best performance and the rest of the cast was right up there with
him.
