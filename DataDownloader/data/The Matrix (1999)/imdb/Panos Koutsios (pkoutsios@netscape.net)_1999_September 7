1999_September 7 

When i first looked at the campaign of this movie , i thought it was just
another one that spend a lot of money to impress the public. But after a few
opinions from my close friends i also temptated to see the movie.<br /><br />The beginning nail me down ! I wasn't expecting the adventure to begin so
soon. Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) fitted in her role exactly. The roof
chasing and the quality of the effects with a very good sound dressing ,
made this and all the actions scenes very realistic.
At first i had the impression that we were in video game. Soon i realize the
magic touch of the special effect team work. It was outstanding!!!
Everything seemed so real, you could believe you were playing a part in this
play. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) was imposing.He gives you the sense of
safety and thrill at the same time.By far he was the key character of the
movie. Keanu Reeves (Thomas A. Anderson/Neo)saw us for another time how
promising actor can be ( that cold look in his eyes !).
The Wachowski's gave us a new idea of the world to be (machines gathering
energy from the people...).They saw us something new and possible to happen.
Who knows...
All the above points to one thing only: DON'T MISS THAT MOVIE, YOU WILL
REGRET IT FOR YOUR REST OF YOUR LIFE. <br /><br />
