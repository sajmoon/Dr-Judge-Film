I bet some X-generationers are going Will who?, maybe<br /><br />even Bruce who?.Sorry folks, before your time.
So what have we got here, a movie with guts,
a film overloaded with special effects, or an<br /><br />anti authority cinema verite?<br /><br />I opt for the second. While the CGI effects,
are the largest, possibly the most costly,
maybe the best you'll ever see on celluloid;
they don't maketh a movie.<br /><br />It could be argued that this piece of cinema
'eye candy' is clearly targeted at the video
game chomping, web addicted under 25 year old
male side of the planet.<br /><br />Why we have a hacker out to save the world
with a renegade half dozen team, a kind of
half apostle contingent. The pseudo-religious
overlay is remarkably upfront and disconnected.
I.e. Morpheus= moses the prophet or Joshua
or John the baptist (take your pick).
Neil/Neo is of cource Christ, the resurrector,
the redeemer, saviour, messiah.Half way through
the film I thought, 'I bet Neil gets nailed!'<br /><br />When I noticed 2/3rds into the movie they
were setting up for a sequel, that's the point
where it all became a huge turnoff for me.
That told me marketing had highjacked the project.
Crass commercialism became like the Matrix itself,
out to delude us by parading before us
illusion of originality while the marketing
execs where really the dark 'agents' hell
bent on preserving this illusion and making
suckers out of all of us.<br /><br />The acting, well I absolutely cringed
on seeing Neil's meeting with the prophet,
(is that an insert from another movie).<br /><br />well how about the viewing experience...
a bad Bruce Lee movie caught in a time
warp. My advice see Dark World, infinitely
better.<br /><br />rating 4
