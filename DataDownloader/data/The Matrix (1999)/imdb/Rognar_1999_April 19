I love it when movies break the mold and last way longer than the usual
hollywood 90 minutes junkpile. The Matrix was a well thought-out movie, with
fair acting and solid special effects. Some scenes reminded me of 'Fire in
the Sky', and yes, it probably inspires itself from some other movies, but
it adds enough innovation and original concepts for it to be in a league of
its own. It'll certainly be a worthy DVD purchase. Check it out, unless you
often have problem understanding movie plots.
