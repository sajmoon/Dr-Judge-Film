1999_April 13 

I heard someone once say that if you you like what someone else is doing
artistically you should steal it from them, but The Matrix takes this a bit
too far. I also heard that when you steal you should try to improve upon the
original idea. The makers of Matrix must have missed that part of the
lesson. The Matrix shamelessly steal its story line (and not too well) from
Dark City (a much better movie that makes sense). The costume designer has
no doubt seen Men In Black. The central man v. machine story was also done
better by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: Space Odyssey. I have to admit that I
liked the movie though, but only for the special effects. Finally, I want to
definitively say Keanu Reeves can't act. So, watch The Matrix but leave your
brain at the door.
