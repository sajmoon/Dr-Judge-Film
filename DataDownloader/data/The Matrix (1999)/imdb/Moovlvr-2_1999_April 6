1999_April 6 

Okay, heres the scoop.  I am a &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; kind of gal. My
boyfriend is a &quot;Soldier&quot; kind of guy.  So when he took me to see this film
I
was skeptical.  I left impressed.  Warner Bros. has made it happen this
time!  I went to see it twice.  It is slightly cerebral so for people who
like to think while watching a movie, its fantastic.  While at the same
time
it is full of awesome action sequences performed by the actors themselves!
Keanu Reeves proves to be a true star, his agility and cool manner, make
it
an icy ride.  It deserves to be a hit.
