The special effects are the best
I have ever seen, and I've seen
'em all.  The concept was a little
too dorm-roomy for my taste.  (Remember
those earnest conversations in your
sophomore year: &quot;What if I'm just a
brain in a vat, man?  And all this is,
like, being fed into my mind by a mad
scientist or something?&quot;)  I loved the
actress who played Trinity.  How many
faces can survive such extreme close-ups?
And what a surprise to learn, here on
IMDb, that she was the female lead in
a 1993 TV series called -- are you ready
for this? -- &quot;Matrix&quot;!  Deja-vu, man.
