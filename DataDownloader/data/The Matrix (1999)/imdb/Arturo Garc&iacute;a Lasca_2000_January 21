&quot;The Matrix&quot;... That is kind of an original name. The Matrix is (besides
&quot;The world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth&quot;)
one of the best movies ever, and lets say that again: EVER!<br /><br />Some people say that The Matrix was not only great because of the action
scenes, but please!, lets not try to fool ourselves, this movie's action
scenes were probably the best ones in history.. so far at least. Of course,
with this I don't mean to say that the movie's script is bad, or that it has
a lack of something.<br /><br />I think The Matrix deserves to be considered one of the best movies ever by
reasons like this: Even the people who don't usually watch or like action
films, liked this one! And why is that? Simple answer: Because the movie is
simply extraordinary.<br /><br />I think Keanu Reeves has had a great career, but this movie moved him to the
top, he will now be remembered by everyone, along with the movie.. And his
look with the black outfit and the glasses is neat.<br /><br />I think Laurence Fishburne did a great performance too as Morpheus, and so
did Carry Anne Moss and Agent Smith.<br /><br />The story of this movie might be a bit out of reality (or completely
unbelievable), but this can't stop this movie from being one of the best
movies of the decade AND the whole century.<br /><br />I personally have watched this movie about 5 times, and the first 2 or 3,
every time I watched it, I discovered new things that I have not seen in the
previews one.<br /><br />Also I would like to say that this movie was very original, for example, at
the beginning, it doesn't show the names of any of the actors in it. Also
the sound effects were for sure the best ones I've ever heard. The sound
track is very good also.<br /><br />This movie deserves to be rated with the highest score possible, maybe more
than any other movie in this year, and that's why I'm giving it a 10 out of
10 score.<br /><br />If you have not seen The Matrix yet, don't waste your time, and see it!
After all the popularity it had, you might expect something very big, but
don't, please, because if you expect something that goes beyond the limits,
you might not like it, after all, it's just another movie.<br /><br />And remember that Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is...
You have to see it for yourself.
