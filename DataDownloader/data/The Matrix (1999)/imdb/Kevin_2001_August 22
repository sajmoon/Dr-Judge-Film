The Matrix... one of the best movies ever made! It's about a computer
generated dream-world we all live in, to hide us from the truth of the real
world.
Only one man can set us free, a man nick-named Neo. He will have to fight
'agents' (the protectors of The Matrix) as he discovers he is The One. Just
watch it, you'll love it!
