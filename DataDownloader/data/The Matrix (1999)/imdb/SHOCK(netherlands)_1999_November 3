1999_November 3 

My favorite of all time. In my case that means the best film of the past
4/5
years. Ofcourse I have seen movies from before that. But the past 4 to 5
years i went to about every movie thats worth seeing. And altough I'm not a
die-hard sci-fi freak this is certainly the best movie I have ever
seen.
The atmosphere around it just sucks you in and doesn't let you go untill
the
credits appear.
I've got only one remark: The soundtrack sucks, maybe it's fits in the
movie
but it's just not my style
(don't pay any attention to my terrible english--&gt; I'm from Holland (you
know... Amsterdam!!) so... )
