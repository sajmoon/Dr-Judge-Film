1999_April 10 

I wouldn't call this the best movie ever, and I wouldnt give this movie a
10/10. I'd say about an 8 or 9.
However, it is a very good movie, and does deserve some credit, but really,
it isn't THAT good.<br /><br />On the positive side: it has great special FX, great sounds and awesome
music. The story line is different, and really makes you think. Actors are
good, and so is the chick. The action scenes (and there's a lot of them) are
pretty good and the overall theme of the movie is good. So you may ask,
what's bad about this film?<br /><br />On the negative side: The movie starts off rather slow and confusing, you
don't really know what anything has to do with anything. But eventually the
storyline picks up and you realise what the matrix is all about. But even
then, the film is very confusing. I still don't understand it fully, and
neither do any of my friends who went with me to see it.
The action scenes are well done, but very unbelievable. I mean, dodging one
hand gun is one thing, but dodging 10 guys with machine guns, come on! So if
they made the action scenes move believable it would be better. Also, there's
very little humour. You expect a couple of funny parts at least, but there's
very few parts that are funny, and the parts that are funny don't make you
laugh much anyway. The part that the agents play was also very lame. If
reminded me too much of MIB, just without the humour. The ending was pretty
good, but really left you up in the air about what happened
after.<br /><br />So, overall a good movie, but not the best, like any movie it has its flaws,
but still can be enjoyable to watch.
I do recommend seing it, but don't expect a perfect movie.<br /><br />
