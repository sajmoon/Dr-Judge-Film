&quot;What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself.&quot; And he's quite
right,
you do. These words spoken by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) were what
convinced me to see the film, unsure of what to expect from it. Braindead
summer blockbuster it is not - far from it. It is one of the most
thought-provoking films of it's kind that I have seen - well written and
directed by the Wachowski Brothers with some really impressive visuals.
Thomas Anderson, nicknamed Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker, is
tracked
down by Morpheus, a well-known terrorist and is offered a chance to
discover
the greatest conspiracy ever imaginable. But, he is told, he can never
return to his normal life and must help to save the world against the
agents
who are concealing the secret. That's all I'll say about the intriguing,
if
somewhat far-fetched plot, because to say too much would ruin the
experience. This is one incredibly fast-paced film, boasting so much
action
it'll blow you away. At its heart, it is a science-fiction thriller, but
The
Matrix is much more chic than you might expect. Complete with black
leather
outfits and dark sunglasses, Neo and fellow world-saver Trinity
(Carrie-Anne
Moss) fight their way through many an action sequence, some unbelievably
over-the-top, and manage to look so calm at the end of it. Although quite
a
dark and violent film, the script allows for some humour to lighten the
mood
every once in a while, and with a climax with more guns, bullets and
explosions than any war film, this has got to be the best action film of
the
year.
