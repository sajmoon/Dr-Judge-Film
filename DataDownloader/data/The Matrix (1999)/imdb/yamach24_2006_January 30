that is the best movie i ever seen.. its fantastic. god bless Larry and
Andy.. (i know 1 thing the ones who vote 1 for this movie are the one
who didn't understand the movie). The lead actors are very very good.
The story is fantastically creative. And the scenes are wonderful.
After that movie i just want to get some weapons and shot everywhere i
see. And about the soundtracks the song where amazing , when i heard
that the lobby scene song that made bye moby, i start to act like slow
motion and get in the mood. God save the black long dresses. After that
movie the destiny of action movies has changed. That is the best action
movie ever made.
