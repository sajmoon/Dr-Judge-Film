Ever felt that the world we live in is not the real world, but instead a
some sort of dream or a sophicasted sort of computer program? If you said
yes a few years ago, you would be seen as a crazy madman with a stupid
conspircary theory. However when you watch the Matrix, it makes you wonder
if we are all alive or not. It is about a computer hacker called Neo who is
asked to joined a viligante group out to save the human race from
destruction. Neo escapes the world he believes that he is in, and ends up
in
a post apocalpytic future. Sounds like you normal run of the mill sci fi
but
you would be wrong. The action sequences are absolutely fantastic
especially
when Neo is fighting his mentor Morpheus. It reminds me so much of the old
kung fu movies, I was expecting some very dodgy dubbing. The acting was
ok,but there was some glimmer of great acting especially from Mr Fishburne.
However it is the special effects that takes the audience breath away. That
is what makes this movie so special. The special effect of the Bullet Time,
(this is where the action stops but the whole thing relvoles to get another
view of it), is so cool. I have to take my hat off and say this is a
brillant movie, and should be watched by anyone from Conspricay Theorists,
Sci Fi Buffs and even the people who does not like sci fi at all.
10/10
