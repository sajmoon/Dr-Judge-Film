I loved this film. I think I can watch it every week. No. Everyday. It's
great. The plot is rather ordinary, but the MOVIE is just splendid.
Effects
- there were lot of words here about that. I enjoyed the soundtrack. I
chose
rob d &quot;clubbed to death&quot; for my exam at model studio, and got excellent
mark
by the way:-)))
Then. &quot;There's no spoon&quot;. I tell it to myself and to my friends before any
kind of crazy action. And it WORKS!!! No spoon - no fear!
8-))))<br /><br />At last, about Keanu Reeves. Really cute:))) I've noticed one thing - as
he
gets older he looks better!
So... Kisses and hugs from Russia!!!
