1999_December 22 

Reeves and Fishburne takes this film to another level, not yet achieved by
another movie. I will say that Matrix will live for many years as one of
the
greatest movies ever. When I saw it the first time I was paralyzed by the
stunning effects and excellent acting. I wouldn't rate this film as a 10
but
more like 12 or 13.<br /><br />&quot;Do you dare believe it's true?&quot;
