When I saw this movie the first time, I thought it was pretty good. Now -
after I've seen it the second time - I think there are some things in the
movie, that is rather incoherent.<br /><br />If anyone can explain me the following points, I would be pleased:<br /><br />- Why does the computers, who has created the human world, need to create
such a fictitious world. The computers need - as I have understood it -
the
human for power, but why do they need the fictitious world.<br /><br />- Why is it, that Keanu Reeves is able to defeat the computers in a
computer-made world.<br /><br />I hope that somebody has answers to these questions.<br /><br />Jesper
