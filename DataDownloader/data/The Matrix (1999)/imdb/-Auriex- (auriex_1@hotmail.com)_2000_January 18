I usually say that one shouldn't go into a movie with expectations, but with
an equal mind for what they might see.  I made the mental mistake of going
into the Matrix with very high expectations after having heard so many rave
reviews about the movie from my peers.<br /><br />Pleasantly enough, my expectations were met ten fold.  I'm glad that there
is finally a movie since the original star wars series (note: I say
original), that fantasy and sci-fi fans can point to with pride.  The movie
makes you think in a way that I believe I can safely say that you have never
thought before.  As you step out of the theater, or press 'Stop' on your
remote control, you'll question the reality that you live in.<br /><br />Maybe.  I did at least. =)  For the arguments against this movie.  If you're
complaining that the plot didn't make sense, I don't know what to say.  Go
and see the movie again.<br /><br />Enough said.  Go and see this movie for your own good, for making the muscle
inside your head flex.<br /><br />10 out of 10
