While not ranking among my top favorite films of all time, I thought this
was one of the better films of 1999, a lot better than your average
science-fiction / action / Chosen-One-saves-the-world flicks. The concept
behind the plot (how real is the world around us?) wasn't too new -- Philip
K. Dick and others have been there many times before --, but that doesn't
keep it from still being interesting. The same goes for the movie: even
though some of the plot elements were cleverly recycled from elsewhere, the
screenplay managed to present them in a new, refreshing, up-tempo, and
thrilling way (though I was a bit annoyed with the dumbo character who
betrayed the lot because he couldn't get the girl. I've seen this too many
times before, and it just didn't fit).<br /><br />The coolest thing about this film, however, was not the screenplay, and it
wasn't the special effects. It was the actors. Hugo Weaving gave me the
creeps as smooth, unscrupulous Agent Smith. Laurence Fishburne was cool
beyond belief, a walking enigma if I've ever seen one. Carrie-Anne Moss...
my God, what can I say...? I just *love* good-looking (and well-dressed)
women who kick butt. Even Keanu Reeves showed some decent acting, even
though he looked a bit too cute at times.<br /><br />A must-see if you're into action movies.
