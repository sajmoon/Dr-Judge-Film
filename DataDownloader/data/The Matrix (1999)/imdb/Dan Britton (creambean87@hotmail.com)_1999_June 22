The Matrix is one of (if not the most) coolest film ever made!It has
revived
Keanu Reeves' career entirely and is a must see for everyone. The only
problem I can see for this film is that when it comes out on video it may
lose its effect unless everyone has 16&quot; T.V's with digital surround
sound!
The FX were immense. It has definitely broken into my number 5 films
ever!
