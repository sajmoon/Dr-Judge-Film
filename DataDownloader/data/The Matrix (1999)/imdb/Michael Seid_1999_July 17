Andy &amp; Larry Wachowski are to be placed right alongside Orson Welles and
Stanley Kubrick in the next editions of historybooks as true innovators of
cinematography.<br /><br />Although the plot is a bit of ol' this an' that, the performance (on film
as
well as on computers) is sheer visual poetry.<br /><br />The mood in The Matrix is perhaps borrowed from Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12
Monkeys) but that is not in any means negative.<br /><br />If the sound by Dane A. Davis and David Lee III (+all the
rest)
doesn't receive an Academy AwardT I'll have to eat my hat.
The audience really was listening on the show I attended, not too common
these days - that's a credit as good as any praise here.<br /><br />Contrary to what Morpheus might say, we now can be sure of a bright future
for mankind's creativity, the light comes from Oz.
