&quot;The Matrix&quot; is just great. The story makes you feel like you are a part
of
the film, you feel what Neo feels. Besides, image is beautiful, the slow
motion is impressive and the special effects are wonderfully made.
However,
the &quot;real&quot; world, outside the matrix is not very convincing. And the end
of
the film is too Hollywood, it is made for the viewer to go out happy
without
being interesting to the story: it could be not so pretty and fake in
order
to end a great story with a great end.
But, in conclusion, you have to see this movie.
