1999_April 7 

First thing that comes to mind...special effects; we're talking nomination
worthy special effects, best I've ever seen. Second thing is
fast-paced...one thing after another, incredible action scene after
incredible action scene...
Third thing...Keanu Reeves, not my first choice as actor. But he pulls it
off...he pulls it off well. The whole movie is excellent...good script,
good
cinematography, strong acting, great sound track...with the possible
exception of tacky mood-music. :-)
