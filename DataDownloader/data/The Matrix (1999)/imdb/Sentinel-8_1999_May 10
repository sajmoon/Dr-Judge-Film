Forget the Biblical connotations.  Forget the fact that this is by far
Keanu
Reeves' best movie.  Laurence Fishburne, Carrie- Anne Moss, and Hugo
Weaving
make this movie the best I have ever seen.  The fighting sequences,
excellent sci-fi plot, and spectacular special effects make this a must
see.
The movie inspired me and also showed me in a &quot;Neo&quot;-Christian way, a
small
idea of what life on Earth may actually be.  It is actually easier to
understand the Christian philosophy after seeing this movie, though it
will
likely upset the hardcore Christian, who will witness mere mortals wield
power like that of God(s).
