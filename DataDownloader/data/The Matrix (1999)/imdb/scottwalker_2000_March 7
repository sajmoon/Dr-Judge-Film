Regardless of anything I could say, good, bad, or otherwise about the
matrix, I must start by asking one simple question.
Who could have possibly voted The Matrix as the 30th best film ever made?
This is so ridiculous I cannot even begin to get infuriated before I
vomit.
But I digress.  Please do not misunderstand. This movie was fine.  It was
interesting.  It had good action sequences, interesting camerawork, and
powerful and well placed special effects.  But, I think this movie lacked
the kind of substance, the true cinematic power, that sets truly great
films apart from those that are just nice f/x vehicles.  Keanu Reeves is
incredibly boring,  he needs to play at least two characters to earn the
money he makes.  Fishburne was cool, but nothing like we've seen from him
before.  How could Matrix rank above BOyz in the Hood or even School
Daze.
The plot was interesting, and even thought provoking, but in the end this
movie is nothing more than brain candy, certainly undeserving of even the
top 250.  What are people watching these days?  Is this the best anyone
can
do?
