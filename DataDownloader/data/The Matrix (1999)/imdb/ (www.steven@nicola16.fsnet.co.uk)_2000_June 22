The Matrix is one of them films that you can watch over and over again but
the first time is always the best. When i first watched this at the cinema
i
was amazed at the fight scenes and how they were so brilliantly
choreographed. The Matrix is a mindblowing film full of spectacular
special
effects that can only be best watched on DVD or at the cinema. It is a
must
see film for everyone whether they like sci-fi films or
not.<br /><br />The reason why the matrix is such a fantastic film is not just the action
with its special effects but also the brilliant casting. Keanu Reeves is
amazing as Neo, this is probably his best film by far. Carrie Ann Moss is
also incredible as Trinity and Laurence Fishburne is outstanding as the
most
dangerous man alive, Morphius. Without them it would not make the film as
popular as it is. If you have not seen this yet you are in for a treat as
you will be blown away. Make sure you see it i highly recommend it. 10 out
of 10.
