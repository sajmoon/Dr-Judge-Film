2002_July 4 

The action sequences are good, but the acting (minus Lawrence Fishburne)
isn't that good at all. Keanu Reeves does his best with &quot;Whoa&quot;, just like
his Bill and Ted days. Catherine Moss isn't much to write home about, but
she does have some good acting bits. The rest of the cast isn't much. Hugo
Weaving gets tiresome as Agent Smith, but his little talk to Morpheus is
very well done. <br /><br />Action sequences...are actually something to write home about. The
bullet-time effect is not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be, but
it was quite refreshing to see a different style of slow-motion. The fight
between Morpheus and Neo is spectacularly done. The last fight though is
delivered poorly. The set-up to that scene is one of the funniest scenes in
the entire movie, and funnier because it wasn't intentionally made to be
funny. Or when Neo &quot;dusts&quot; himself off...that's quite amusing as
well.<br /><br />Major fans of this kind of science fiction will praise the movie with glory
it doesn't deserve. Casual fans of this kind of science fiction will do the
same. Those who loved &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot; may see this flick
as a total rehash of the past 20 years of science fiction (both good and
bad). 7 out of 10.
