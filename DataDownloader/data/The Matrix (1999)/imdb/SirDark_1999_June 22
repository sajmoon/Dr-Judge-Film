1999_June 22 

It's obvious that the directors have seen a lot of movies from Hong Kong
and
the fact that Yuen Woo Ping also worked on this film as martial arts and
stunt director has left it's mark on this movie. This movie has all the
trademarks of a Hong Kong action movie. Beautiful visuals, furious martial
arts sequences,
lots of wirework, over the top violence bordering on the cartoonish and
last
of all a story which falls apart once you start thinking about it. Go see
this movie for the visuals and action/stunt sequences. The acting is lousy
although not a hinderance because there's enough going on to grab your
attention. All in all an entertaining picture.
