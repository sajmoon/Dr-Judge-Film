1999_August 30 

I know, I know, Keanu Reeves is in it, so how good can it be?  Using some of
his earlier mastery of the dialogue, I would say that this film is &quot;most
heinously righteous.&quot;<br /><br />Who'd have thought?  This is actually one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever
seen.  The whole plot is revealed early on, yet you still have no idea what
is going on.  It is a thrill a second roller-coaster of a ride through a
world that none can dream of.  All BS aside, this is really a fine motion
picture.  I would hope to see it take some awards for special effects and
cinematography.  Keanu (or Canoo, as I refer to him) is still challenged as
an actor, but his role fits him, as &quot;Neo&quot; is confused,
too.<br /><br />I saw it on the big screen and pre-ordered it on DVD.  Definitely a watch
again and again flick.<br /><br />My two cents worth.
