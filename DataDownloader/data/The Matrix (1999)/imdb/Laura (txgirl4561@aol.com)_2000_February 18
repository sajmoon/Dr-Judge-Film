This movie got a lot of hype it didn't deserve. I thought it was okay, the
special effects were awesome and the overall idea was pretty cool (yet
completely unrealistic)... but I really didn't think it was that great!
Though I understood it, it was hard to follow... and I found myself wanting
to do something else... but I forced myself to watch it, I thought maybe I'd
miss out on something. I didn't. I could have easily done without this
movie, it wasn't that wonderful. Yes, the special effects, once again, were
cool, but think of how great this movie would have been if it kept your
attention? So many loved this movie, but I thought it was really tasteless.
You see it, make your own opinion, but this is mine.
