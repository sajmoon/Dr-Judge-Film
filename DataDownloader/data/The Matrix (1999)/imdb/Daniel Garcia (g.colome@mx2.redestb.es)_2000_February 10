One of the best of the best &#145;cause I think it overcomes a lot of this kind
of action movies. I think Keanu is the least of it. The best of the movie is
the story. I don't know if it is an original story, but the directors have
known very well how to take it to celluloid. I like the soundtrack very much
too.<br /><br />First time I watched the trailer in theaters I knew this film would be a
great movie, and it has been.
