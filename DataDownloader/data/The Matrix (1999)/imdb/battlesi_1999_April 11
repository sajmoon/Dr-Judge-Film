1999_April 11 

Laurence Fishburne has done a good job of some great characters, this is not
one of them.  Keanu Reeves has insisted on playing Ted from the Bill and Ted
movies, even when he's not supposed to and he does it again here.  The
concept behind this movie is great.  The effects are fantastic even if it is
a bit hard to believe the robots shaped like squids.  Hugo Weaving does a
cool job playing the evil agent Smith.  But of course even he cannot pull
this film out of the mediocrity which Reeves stamps on each picture he stars
in.  The best bits of this film (apart from Weaving's strange American
accent) are seeing the Sydney skyline and trying to figure out where you've
seen John Pantoliano before.
