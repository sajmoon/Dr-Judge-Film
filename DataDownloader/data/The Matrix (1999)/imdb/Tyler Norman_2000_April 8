2000_April 8 

I really regret that I didn't see this in the theater. I saw this for the
first time when I rented the DVD in January. Digital reciever. I really like
the way they make everything look &quot;dead&quot;, because in essence it is, due to
the fact that evereyone is in the Matrix. This film deserved every Oscar it
won. The special effects are like nothing ever seen before, in fact, the
concept of &quot;bullet time&quot; was invented for the film. This is a technique in
which an actor surrounded by bluescreen does a stunt, and is photographed in
a film sequence by an arc of over 100 still cameras. Therefore, a quick jump
can appear slow and the camera can quickly pan around, etc. The sound is
also awesome. If you have a surround system, crank up the volume and turn
your subwoofer up as high as it can go, and brace yourself. The scene on the
roof, where the bullets are going slow and making weird trails, sounds
absolutely amazing. In fact, that scene is an excellent clip to use in
showing off your surround system. I'm really looking forward to the sequel
in 2001.
