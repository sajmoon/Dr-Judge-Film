'The Matrix' is a top notch action flick.  As one of the
few
fans of Keanu's acting abilities, his presence was not cause 
for alarm.  Obviously the special effects were outstanding,
but the story line was very confusing.  Using humans as 'energy' sources is
a great premise but they didn't expand upon this
theme.  &quot;Bound&quot; had a much stronger script and since the brothers did both
films, they shouldn't have counted on the
action and f/x to carry the day.   Otherwise, it's a solid
film.
