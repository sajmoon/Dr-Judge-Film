This Movie has it all.  Special Effects, Romance, Action, Fighting,
Comedy,
even a great Sound Track.  This concept has driven the Matrix to become
the
standard that all other movies will 'try' to reach for the next five
years.<br /><br />Brilliantly acted and written, this movie will keep you on your toes.  I
even loved the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; references throughout the movie.
What
more can I say without revealing What the Matrix is?<br /><br />Just go see it on the Big Screen with Surround.  It's Definitely worth the
ticket price.
I saw it twice and I'm ready for the home video.
