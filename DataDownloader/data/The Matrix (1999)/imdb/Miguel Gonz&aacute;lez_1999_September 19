1999_September 19 

Come on, how can anyone say this is a good, deep, reflexive movie? Have you
ever seen Dark city, Total recall, The thirteenth floor (highly underated
movie), and many others? It has SOME good FXs (and all were show on the
trailer), but the action is in a boring video game style. If it WAS an
original idea, maybe i'd say this is a good movie. But since it's just a
remix of many great stories, i'd say THE MATRIX is just a mirage of a good
movie.
