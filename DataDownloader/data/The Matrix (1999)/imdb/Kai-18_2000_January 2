This has a surprizingly good plot for an action flick.  And even better
Keanu Reeves improves himself above a joke of an actor (although Devil's
Advocate was a good movie).  A lot of cool action, inventive special effects
and high tension of action scenes.  The characters were likable and though
there are some Jesus parallels, you won't care cause you'll be wrapped up in
the great story.  Can't wait for the next films (it's gonna be a trilogy.
Hey, same with Blade.  How come action/sci-fi flicks are going trilogy these
days.  Probably due to Star Wars.)
