1999_June 24 

All the images of the Matrix were very powerful, with much eye for detail,
and the special effects were subtle, not overdone but masterful. Here and
there, the story was somewhat cliche, I thought. The prophecy of 'The One'
who would 'set humanity free' sounded a bit like Star Wars, if you see
what
I mean. Also, without wanting to give away too much, there were elements
in
the of human-machine interaction that were not very convincing... if you
start to think about it. But it was only when I left the cinema that I
started to think about the weak spots in the plot.
Of course there is plenty of unbounded violence that accompanies this film
which doesn't really appeal to me. It seems to go with American cinema
somehow. I'd appreciate it if they'd stop that.
Having said that, there were moments in this film that left me gasping.
But... you can't be told what The Matrix is. Go and see for
yourself!
