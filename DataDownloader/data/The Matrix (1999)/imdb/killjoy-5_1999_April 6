1999_April 6 

This is the movie that the CGI wizards have been promising.  An
outstanding
story welded together with amazing special effects.  A combination of many
types of filmworks, including martial arts films, John Woo-Style gunplay,
and dizzying science-fiction, this film is the first great movie I have
seen
this year.  Unlike the horrible &quot;Godzilla&quot; or &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, this movie
uses its special effects to enhance, not replace, its story. The W2
brothers
have done it again, easily topping their lurid, but enticing previous
film,
&quot;Bound&quot;.  Check out this one for sure!
