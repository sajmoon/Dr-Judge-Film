The Matrix is a great movie, but it does have its flaws.  The beginning of
the movie is long and drawn out, I actually had a person snoring behind me.
But, after the first hour the movie starts to rock, until the end.  The end
of the movie seemed rushed.  In my opinion, I believe that the story had too
many different plot details, and they couldn't resolve all the issues, so
a lot of issues went unresolved.  That is why I believe the end
sucked.
