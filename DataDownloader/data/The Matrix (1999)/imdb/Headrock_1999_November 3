1999_November 3 

I agree that Matrix had two very strong points, its amazing visuality, and
its intricate and sophisticated plot (An idea which is original and
entertaining), however the way that the plot was translated into a film
disturbs me a bit. It seems like this is more of a child's version of the
idea, rather than a possible sophisticated movie, which could have broken
alot of barriers had it not been so simplistic. The movie seems to beckon
forward to those pale-faced teenagers who've actually liked the thousands of
tired conspiracy episodes on &quot;X-Files&quot; - It's all there, and is in fact best
described as somewhat of the fantasy of the socially inactive
computer-freak. This so-called computer-freak portrayed by kiano is suddenly
thrust into realization that he is living inside an unreal world, a world
that was designed for him and the other humans, but in fact he is the most
powerful in that world, and that in his skills (which actually translate
into computer skills, may I add) will help him save the world from obscure
&quot;agents&quot; which seem to operate under no logic (They are programs, but seem
disturbingly unlike programs, especially when existing in a pre-programmed
world), hoping to assumingly &quot;shut-down&quot; these &quot;illegal&quot; hackers into the
matrix. I'm not a psychologist, but aren't these the general guidelines of a
typical pre-mature male fantasy? 
So what is the Matrix?
In my opinion, a movie with much potential, wasted as an appeal to a certain
audience, which will probably misunderstand or misinterpret the deep meaning
that the original idea held within.<br /><br />Perhaps I am mistaken, and it was in fact an appeal to the majority, and I
simply misunderstood. Therefore I do not presume to know exactly what the
majority thinks, and perhaps other comments will set me
straight.
