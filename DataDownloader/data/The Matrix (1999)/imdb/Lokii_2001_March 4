Overall, the matrix is a powerful film. The plot is wickedly creative and
almost shocking the first time you see this movie. The directors are
obviously very talented, and the atmosphere of this movie is very, very
cool. The acting was decent but nothing fantastic, although I really liked
Laurence Fishburne and the main detective. I normally dislike Keanu Reeves,
I think that he is a very mediocre actor. However, in this movie his lack of
acting skills fits the clueless Neo role perfectly, so he's all right. I
have to say that the first half of the movie is amazing, then it starts to
taper off a bit. Unfortunately, the last 15 minutes are truly disappointing.
Throughout most of the movie I was amazed at how original everything was,
but the end was full of cheesy clich&eacute;s. Although it is a low-point, the
ending is still good enough to make this a truly great movie. It is surely
one of the best action movies of the 90s. I give it 9/10
