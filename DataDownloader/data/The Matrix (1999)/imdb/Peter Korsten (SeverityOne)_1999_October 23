1999_October 23 

I don't know why everybody is so hyped about this story. The idea is nice -
we all live in a fantasy world - but it's not original and there are many
holes in it.<br /><br />For instance: machines use people as a power source, because the sky is
totally covered with clouds. But where do people get their power from? I'd
say from plants and animals, and animals get it from plants. But plants
won't grow if there's no sunlight.<br /><br />Frankly, I thought it was an insult to my intelligence.<br /><br />For the rest, it looked a bit like a mix between Blade Runner,
Streetfighter, Quake and some manga. Plus Baywatch, because of the slow
motion sequences.<br /><br />There are more things in this movie that don't make any sense, like that you
need a telephone to get out of the dream world. But how do you get in?<br /><br />What was really annoying were the long monologues in which the (unlogical)
story was explained. The acting wasn't very good either. Kenau Reeves was
the best actor.<br /><br />The effects, on the other hand, are outstanding. I especially like the scene
in the beginning, where the girl jumps up, the picture freezes and the
camera turns around her in a half circle. Simply brilliant.<br /><br />I think what most annoys me about this movie is that it appears in the top
30. There are more than 30 movies who are better than this one, believe me.
It lacks too much in the acting and plot department to make it a great
movie. It's good, but not great.
