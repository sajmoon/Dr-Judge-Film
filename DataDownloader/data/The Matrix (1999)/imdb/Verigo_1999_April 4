1999_April 4 

Well, that quote in the preview, &quot;you have to see it for yourself&quot; worked on
me; I went and saw it. But still I went only expecting those great digital
effects, and not much in the way of a plot. I even wondered if all that
computer generated imagery there for no other reason than to dazzle the eye.
Boy, was I ever wrong! This sci-fi thriller had a great storyline, written
and directed by two brothers. Think of it having a dark reality like in
Blade Runner, yet the action and adventure of Die Hard. Great effects,
unique sci-fi quirks, and an AI Agent so rotten you're glad to get to the
end of the movie just so you can see him get killed off! Unfortunately, I
cannot give away the storyline... you have to see it for
yourself!
