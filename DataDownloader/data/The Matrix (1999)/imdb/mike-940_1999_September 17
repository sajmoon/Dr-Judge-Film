1999_September 17 

the matrix was by far one of Keanu Reeves finest movies yet it makes one
wonder what if we really were living in nothing but a matrix ?????  I was
taken aback by the special effects , and sometimes it is nice to associate
with one character.  It is not hard to see how presistence and discipline
can pay off in a movie.  NO wonder ,  look at all of the movies that are
trying to copy off the text of it .  I wish them good luck, but they will
not even come close
