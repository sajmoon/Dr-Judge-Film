I watched this movie in cinema long time ago and I never forget the
feelings when leaving after watch. This film changed my life. I started
to think a little different. It was access to myself. Wachowski Bros.
made fantastic piece of art. I think all movie fans know this title and
they never forget it. Do you remember when you first time saw it? I
remember very well this stunning visual effects which they looked like
real. I was so excited watching this film. Every second of this movie
is worth seeing. The story told in &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is really important to
this world because no one knows the future and it shows how could it be
and how A.I. may be. It&#x27;s a warning to humanity. I strongly recommend
to see this movie. If you like action on the best level you must watch
it and enjoy superb story with great stunning effects (visual and
sound).
