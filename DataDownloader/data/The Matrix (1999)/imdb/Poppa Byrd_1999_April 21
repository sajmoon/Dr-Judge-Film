1999_April 21 

Fun movie and great special effects, but not too much more.  Each character
dresses, looks, and acts in the same manner; mysteriously hidden behind
their sleek sunglasses and black trenchcoats.  The Matrix is over two hours
of a Buddha-like Lawrence Fishburne frowning, and a surprisingly tolerable
Keanu Reeves kept in a perpetual state of confusion.  Also, many of the
film's most exciting sequences were unfortunately drawn out.  However, The
Matrix redeems itself with graphic, yet interesting scenes and more
developed ideas that are reminiscent of other science fiction films such as
&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot;.  The Matrix is easily deserving of a
7/10.
