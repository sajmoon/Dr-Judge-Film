1999_November 1 

From the beginning, this movie is one hell of a ride.  The action is fast
and furious with mind-blowing special effects that make any other movie pale
in comparison.  On top of all that eye candy, the plot is intelligent and
kind of makes you see the world from a *very* different perspective.<br /><br />The cast was absolutely top-notch, particularly Reeves and Fishburne.  If
there was any slow parts to the movie, I vaguely remember them.  The whole
look is something derived from slick comic books but nothing about this
movie can compare.  As far as action and effects, Terminator 2 was the only
movie I can even think of that comes close.  It's a must see!
