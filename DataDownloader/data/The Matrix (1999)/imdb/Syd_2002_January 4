This was the best action movie I'v ever seen and I cant wait for the
2
sequels.Not only was the plot AMAZING! but the charecters and music were
very well chosen.The action sequences were awsome.I stand corrected
FRICKIN
AWSOME!!The actors had kung-fu training for 5 months and poor Keanu.When
they started training Keanu Reeves (&quot;SPEED&quot;)had just had his neck
fused.When
they practiced kicking he had a hard time.Then,when they finally started
filming the movie in 98,they were going to begin the action sequences
first,right after their training, but then they got word that Keanu's neck
didn't fuse right so they did the office sceen first.OK enough about
Keanu.The editing was great in this movie.Every time someone spit up
blood,
it stayed there 'till the charecter wiped it off.And don't let the R
rating
fool you.The worst word they say in that movie is sh**and come on that's
not
that bad.The movie is very suspensful and the problems never go away.2
huge
thumbs up to the Wachowski Brothers (&quot;BOUND&quot;)I cant possibly imagine how
they came up with this!!Every time I wach The Matrix I find somthing new
that I hadn't see before.And I'v seen this movie at least 200 times(no
kidding)along with Speed (also Keanu Reeves)So pretty much,all I'm trying
to
say is if you haven't seen The Matrix yet because you thought it was going
to be another stupid sci/fi action flic with no plot,no story line and no
reason to be filmed at all like  the other action,sci/fi movies out there
then my friend your wrong, terribly wrong.And you should go rent it to
show
you how right I am.And if you don't feel like waisting the money to rent
it
because you think it's going to be stupid,then go to JOBLO.com and
download
the script.But just let me warn you,words can not possibly compare to
sight.Ok I'll go shut up now
