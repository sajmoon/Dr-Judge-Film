1999_May 7 

&quot;Matrix&quot; was definitely thought-provoking.  I've been a hard-core science
fiction fan since I was in my early teens, and am always glad to see a
film
which draws on some of the more complex ideas of the written genre, as
opposed to stereotypical space operas.<br /><br />I did find a few faults with the underlying rationale for the AI
exploitation of the human race, however.  Supposedly the machines had been
almost entirely reliant on solar power (which I found a dubious premise to
begin with), and then we're told that the perpetual smog has blocked out
that power source, necessitating using people as living electrical
generators/batteries.  The problem with that idea is that a human being
(and
indeed any form of biological life) requires energy input, and where are
all
those calories coming from?  There was mention of recycling the dead
people
and feeding them to the live ones, but even assuming 100% energy recapture
efficiency (a practical impossibility), no more can be gotten out of the
people than is being put in, and the machines' use of that power
represents
an external drain on the biological system.  Also, I'm afraid it's absurd
to
postulate (as the movie did) that Earth's interior could cool
significantly
over the course of a couple of hundred years in the absence of sunlight --
it would probably take closer to a couple of billion years.  After all,
it's
almost as hot down below nowadays as it was a couple of billion years ago,
and the slow rate of heat loss by radiation into space has had a lot more
to
do with that than the influx of sunlight.<br /><br />These flaws didn't ruin the movie for me, because I could think of at
least
one better reason for the machines to be exploiting the human race in an
even more horrific fashion.  For instance, the human brain is a much
better
computer in some ways than anything we're ever likely to build, and I can
see how a new breed of artificial intelligences might want to use that
processing power for its own purposes.  And since very little of our brain
capacity is directly involved in conscious thought, I can see how the AIs
might be content to use only the unconscious parts, or possibly every
conscious effort by a human in the virtual world could actually be a
processing activity for the benefit of the machines in a disguised,
symbolic
form.  Thus, rather than providing us with a virtual reality merely to
keep
us biologically functional, the VR could be part of the exploitation
itself.<br /><br />For whatever purpose it might be done, the images of people being raised
from birth obliviously socketed in endless hardware arrays will be with me
for a long time.<br /><br />Of all the ideas presented in the movie, the one I found most intriguing
in
an intellectual sense was that even if we could be presented with a
perfect,
utopian virtual reality, our brains would reject it because the element of
struggle against adversity would be missing.  And I wonder how at the end,
the movie's hero could ever be sure that all his trials and seeming
successes within the virtual world, and even the supposedly real external
world, hadn't merely taken place in an even larger virtual reality.  How
could he ever know that his &quot;real&quot; body wasn't still plugged in somewhere?
For that matter, how can any of us ever know that ours aren't?  Descartes,
who mused several hundred years ago about the dilemma of a person trapped
by
an &quot;evil genius&quot; in an imaginary world indistinguishable from a real one,
would've appreciated &quot;Matrix,&quot; I'm sure.<br /><br />
