1999_April 19 

What a pathetic film.... and I hate to say that, because
friends
of mine worked on this.  This is the kind of film which
you
should be able to take a guilty pleasure in--if it had
done
two weeks at the box office, then went to video and escaped
the notice of critics.  Instead, everyone's lauding a fourth-rate B-movie
with sub-par special effects, a mind-numbingly boring opening 45 minutes and
fight scenes which it is hard to believe Wo-Ping Yuan choreographed (Perhaps
he had a lousy DP?  Did the Wachowski brothers make him choreograph the
scenes blindfolded?).  Go watch &quot;Tai Chi Master&quot; (1996), and then you'll
understand what you're missing and why Keanu Reeves looks ludicrously like a
10-yr-old playing at Kung Fu.  The last half of the film kept me awake
because I was laughing (not with the film--at it).  This is the worst script
since Titanic, and--no--the special effects in this film were not good
enough to excuse it from being this bad.  Is everyone out there suffering
from some mass delusion manufactured by the studios?  Free your mind...
