Not that the film needs any help -- it's a masterpiece -- but still it
does
help to see Bound by the Brothers W.  They lay out their themes there,
plain
to see.  Trust, for one.  How can two people trust each other?  The Ws
say,
if they feel they're the same person.  Bondage and freedom, for another
theme.  But that's developed more in The Matrix.  Here we have a captive
humanity held in check by the AI -- the government, essentially (in Bound,
the oppressor's name is Caesar) -- and freed by the forces of Zion (a
spiritual reality that frees the mind from illusion).  Neo and Trinity,
who
look alike (the One and the Three, reminiscent of &quot;one God in three
persons&quot;), share a trust and a love that gives them the final liberation.
The conceptual structure builds out from there with remarkable discipline.
Now, can the Ws keep this up for the two remaining episodes of the
trilogy?
