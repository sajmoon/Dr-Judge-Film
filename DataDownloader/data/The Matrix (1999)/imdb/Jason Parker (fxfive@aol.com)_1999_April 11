1999_April 11 

This movie left me wanting so much more from the script and the rest of
the
plot. That and Keanu Reeves seriously needs to spend more time with his
band. Don't get me wrong, the kung fu sequences were spectacular, and the
special effects were, to this day, untouched.
I loved this movie because of the special effects and the concept. I
believe it could have been presented better through the: script, dialogue,
and choice of leading man.
(NOTE: Check out the sound track. It's very well done and fits the movie
quite well.)
