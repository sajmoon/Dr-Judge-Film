1999_July 29 

From the time I first saw the preview to THE MATRIX I knew I would have to
see it. I went around telling people that the movie would most likely have
no plot. But can you blame me? Look around at most of the movies that today
lure you in (I'm one of the biggest victims of such scams) with only their
cold, visual, and sometimes superficially stunning effects. But after seeing
the movie the effects become meaningless and dry. One size does not fit all,
and THE MATRIX proves that.<br /><br />Featuring an extremely talented cast (Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne,
Carrie-Anne Moss), as well as Gloria Foster's mother-like role as the Oracle
(a seer and a guide in their attempts to destroy the Matrix) and Hugo
Weaving's role as the &quot;head&quot; agent programmed to kill intruders in the
Matrix, this brilliant film is not only emphasized by the Wachowskis'
talents (written and directed), but also by the cast's extraordinary way of
executing their character's personality. Also, I noticed, the &quot;good&quot; roles
were also emphasized by biblical implications such as Morpheus's ship being
named the Nebuchadnezzar and the last human city being named
Zion.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't realized when the thought of the picture was being
conceived, but by the plot being to erase all reality allowed Andy and Larry
Wachowski to re-write all the rules of so called &quot;reality&quot; and format it to
whatever their imagination could spawn. In short, by doing this, they could
do nothing to contradict &quot;reality&quot; in any way.<br /><br />In spite of all this, I do have to admit that the whole plot of this movie
may not be fully comprehended the first time you view it. I've seen this
movie twice in theaters and the details are still slightly fuzzy, but every
time is just as enjoyable as the next. There's really no doubt that in  the
near future directors and writers will begin to imitate the style and
context that the Wachowski's have conceived (you on see the making on HBO
first look).What is the Matrix? I'll tell you the same thing I tell everyone
else, you'll have to see it for yourself. It may even make you suspicious of
the world around you and question &quot;reality&quot; its self. <br /><br />
