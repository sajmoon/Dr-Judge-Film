1999_April 5 

I must say this is a big movie. I'm not talking about just the length of it,
but what is to be comprehended with it. Lawrence Fishburne was right as it
cannot be explained to you. You just have to see it.<br /><br />While it may take bits of other films to tell this story, it still has quite
a bit of originality to make it quite the unique film. I haven't seen a sci
fi film this big since The Fifth Element, but I like this
better.<br /><br />While it's cheezy and trendy to call it a &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; film, this one has all
the others beat. Johnny Mnemonic was truly awful, but this one was
excellent. The biggest visual that still sticks in my head is the baby farm
segment.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this will be a box office smash, but I think it's going to
make its mark for die hard sci fi fans. It has all its bases covered without
being a silly 90 minute action flick, and I'm betting fan websites as well
as fan fiction are going to be popping up around this.<br /><br />Just go see it. You'll be in for a real trip.
