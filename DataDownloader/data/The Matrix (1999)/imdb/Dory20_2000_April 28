As far as Sci-fi thrillers go, this was one of the best I've seen. A
thinking person's film, despite the high-impact violence, that's full of
subtle and overt metaphors and analogy's. I found myself still thinking
about it hours after watching the video. Spectacular and interesting F/X,
so
much so that it will leave you wondering &quot;how DID they do THAT?&quot; Can
barely
wait for the two sequels to debut! Am very delighted that Keanu Reeves
will
make a reprise performance. It's a goodie -- go rent it!
