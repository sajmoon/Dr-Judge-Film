1999_September 23 

The matrix really fascinated me. I really like the storyline, just like the
story of the 13th floor. But not only the story is great, so are the special
effects presented on screen. I have never seen better kung-fu fighting and
sci-fi combat scenes till now. Together with the eye candy goes a great
soundtrack. I only hope that part 2 and 3 are as good, and i think they will
because 3 parts were planned from the beginning. Till then I will be
watching this great movie on DVD.
