1999_April 10 

The visual style is terrific, and the story sucks you in well enough if you
can get around the (under-exposed) primary premise. The mythic allusion and
religious allegory is all-just-sort-of-OK. No one is going to emerge from
this movie with a much deeper view of life or anything.<br /><br />It's hard to root for Keanu Reeves, whose choppy pace can interrupt any good
story for me, but it's undeniable that he pulls this one off. Everyone who
usually holds their nose and steers clear of a project because he's in it,
go ahead and go.<br /><br />Personally, I wasn't too thrilled with the dialogue or the other
performances, and the soundtrack did most definitely suck. But as eye-candy
this ranks high. Find the biggest screen near you.
