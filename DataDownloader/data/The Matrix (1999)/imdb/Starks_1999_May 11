1999_May 11 

I saw the Matrix this past weekend and I was very impressed by it.  While
I
have certainly seen better sci/fiction films and better action films, it
was
nice to see the two genres combined so nicely. I would rank it up there
with
Terminator and Alien (s).  The story took a while to get going and there
are
also a few moments where you try to figure what Larry (whoops sorry,
Laurence) Fishburne is talking about, but once everything gets on track it
is a fun ride.  My one complaint is that except for a few instances you
never felt any empathy for the lead characters.  In other action adventure
films or sci fi flix you care if something happens to Luke Skywalker, or
Ripley or Indiana Jones.  In this you don't really care (at least I
didn't)
if Keanu or Larry kicked the bucket.  A little more character development
would have made me care a little more and would have put me on the edge of
my seat.  But it is still a fun movie, with some excellent effects and
most
importantly an interesting story that may make you run out and buy some
philosophy books.
