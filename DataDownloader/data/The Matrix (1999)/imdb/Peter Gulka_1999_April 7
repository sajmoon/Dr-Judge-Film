1999_April 7 

Traditionally in Hollywood, big budget effects movies' story lines tend to
suck inversely proportionally to the quality of the effects, with a few
notable exceptions. We are told by the big wigs, that we are too stupid to
get it, and must be spoon fed what a movie is trying to say. Here is a film
that breaks the mold thoroughly. The story line is very taught and well
developed, (kinda the greatest story ever told meets dark city meets
hackers)and the effects are a tool to further the telling of the story. In
this kind of movie clearly fancy effects are required, but we are left to
use our brains to figure out what is going on and what its implications are
to us. I for one will have to see it at least twice to get all the stuff
that ties together. Kudos to the directors on making us think!
