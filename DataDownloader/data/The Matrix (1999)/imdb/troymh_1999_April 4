1999_April 4 

Cool special effects and computer animation.  The plot was not what I
expected; it was dark and depressing.  The movie was somewhat predictable
and the ending left a lot to be desired.  Laurence Fishburne puts in a
solid, if not stellar, performance and Keanu Reeves still needs acting
lessons.  Save the eight bucks and wait for it on video.
