Tom Anderson (Reeves) believes he lives a normal life until he is found
by Morpheus (Fishburne) who shows him he has been living in a dream
world and now they must join forces in a battle against the machine
world.<br /><br />The question of reality, the complexity of life and the dismal
mechanical futuristic view is the Wachowski brothers The Matrix.<br /><br />Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lucas&#39; Star Wars take a look at
outer space in a hard hitting entertaining manner and this 1999
depiction of reality is equally visually stunning with a wonderful
puzzling narrative and high intellectual entertainment.<br /><br />Opening with a rooftop chase and a strange life risking dash to a
telephone box, The Matrix then unfolds into mystery after mystery as
Neo, along with the viewers, tries to decode the strangeness of what is
the Matrix.<br /><br />This film is more than a 2 hour Sci-Fi masterpiece. It is a picturesque
puzzle that leaves the viewer with many questions that are a joy to
discuss.<br /><br />The effects help cement the feel of the futuristic world and the
differences between the Matrix and the machine world. Bright and smart,
the directors have created a visionary film through the use of some of
the finest effects you will see. The green letter encoding sequences
are now legendary and the slowing down sequences is a target for spoofs
despite the brilliance of them.<br /><br />The performances are secondary next to the bizarrely beautiful
narrative. Hugo Weaving&#39;s Agent Smith is a stand out, a fantastic
villain that is the only thing that gets better as the trilogy
progresses.<br /><br />The ending puts a damper on the narrative by being too over the top and
diving into last gasp convention, However overall this is a fine
sophisticated Sci-Fi drama that questions reality in a deep and
meaningful manner.<br /><br />Sadly the originality and imagination of this film was ruined by two
over the top gung ho action sequels.<br /><br />For quality entertainment watch this film and stay clear of the sequels
which will leave you with an open mind and plenty of questions to
ponder and discuss.
