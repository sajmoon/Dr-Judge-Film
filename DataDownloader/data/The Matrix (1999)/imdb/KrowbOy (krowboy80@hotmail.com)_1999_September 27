1999_September 27 

I went to see The Matrix on its opening night in theatres so when it hit
dvd
i went out and got me a copy.  I was one of the few who liked Johnny
Mneumonic (or however its spelled) and for the most part liked all Keanu
Reeves movies (this and Point Break are the best).  I never saw the
Wachowski Bros. other movie but i remembered that they were former comic
book writers and i love comics especially Heavy Metal, Spawn, etc.  The
Matrix looks great its beautiful to look at and the special effects are
awesome.  All the actors did great...i mean really really great in my
opinion.  I didn't think the movie was hard to follow like some people
said,
it takes (not copies) things from The Terminator (machines being stronger
and enslaving man), the Bible (need i explain), and Hong Kong/Kung Fu
movies.  Lots say its action is like John Woo but to me its like Tsui
Hark,
but then again it takes all these things and creates one of the coolest,
best, and original movies EVER.  I can't say enough about this movie and i
applaud Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo
Weeving
for going through training for the fight scenes.  The Wachowski's are now
part of my best directors catagory( which also includes George A. Romero,
Alex de la Iglesia and others).  Also i urge everyone who has HBO to watch
Heavy Metal:FAKK when it premieres in March.  THE MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE
OF 1999 AND PERHAPS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.
