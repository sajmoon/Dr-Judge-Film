Matrix is really one of my all-time-favourites, the story is really great,
you can think about all the little details for quite some time, and the
effects are just absolute classics, and were quite often copied since. To
make it short: If you haven't seen this one yet, DO IT NOW! You'll like it,
everything is just VERY well done, there were no aspects that i didn't
like.
