1999_April 4 

(I am French so my english is probably not really good).
When you are leaving the cinema, you are looking everywhere and you are
thinking if what you see is what you get.
I think that &quot;The Matrix&quot; could be a master piece in the &quot;undermind cinema&quot;
as Dark City.
In the beginning you're lost as Keanu Reeves, and you don't understand what's
happening.
Then comes the surprise: the heroes are not some kind of supermen, but just
some people who know the truth, THE REAL TRUTH.
The Matrix brings you into a nightmare, a world ruled by computers, a &quot;ghost
world&quot; where men are virus.
This movie is crossing the boundaries of imagination and really makes you
think about one thing: is the world is true or just a fake.
Keanu Reeves is making a quite good characters (but I think that they could
have cast somebody else).<br /><br />Just free your mind...and try to jump trough this movie.
You will enjoy it.
