1999_April 14 

I enjoyed watching &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  However, it's no &quot;Blade Runner.&quot;  The
martial
arts sequences were pretty cool, especially the very first fight sequence,
which took me by surprise.  The costumes were cool, and some of the lines
were damn
funny, those which were very specific to the weird world of the
Matrix.<br /><br />What kept this film from being a real winner for me were the slow pacing
and
the large character and plot holes riddling the story.  The world of the
film
didn't seem to make any sense, and I question what goal our heroes are
actually
fighting for.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job in his role.  He even
made
me laugh with him (as opposed to the usual &quot;at him&quot;).<br /><br />So see the film if you want to see good use of gratuitous special effects
and
the first real look at a &quot;virtual reality&quot;-themed film.  But if you're
looking
for a mental twister, look elsewhere.  Some holes really bugged me during
the
film, and once I'd left the theater and started thinking about it, the
whole
thing crumbled.  Alas.
