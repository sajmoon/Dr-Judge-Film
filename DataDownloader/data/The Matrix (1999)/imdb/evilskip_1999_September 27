 What if your &quot;reality&quot; wasn't real at all?What if your &quot;life&quot; was a
computer program fed into your by evil artficial intelligence that was using
you as a power source? Welcome to the future.<br /><br /> A group of rebels separated from the computers fight for the freedom of an
enslaved mankind.A prophetess declares that Neo(Reeves) is the one to lead
them out of the darkness.The rebels risk their lives to bring him out of his
force fed life into the real world.<br /><br /> The special effects are outstanding and the plot is riveting. This has to
be one of the most original and well thought out movies in the past 30
years.2001 can't even stand in the shadow of this gem.<br /><br /> My only regret is that I didn't get to see it on the big
screen
and I'm kicking myself for this.Go rent it and prepare to be amazed.A rare
solid 10.
