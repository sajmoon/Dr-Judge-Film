1999_April 16 

Matrix is a stunning achievement in visual effects, but Keanu Reeves and
Laurence Fishburne both give dreadfully flat and boring performances.  In
short I didn't care about any of the characters, and was bored by the hour
long explanation of the plot (this after Fishburne's character claims that
&quot;no one can be told what the Matrix is&quot;).  The Matrix had a similar plot
structure to one of 1998's best movies &quot;Dark City&quot; which unlike the Matrix,
didn't bog down the action with boring actors and dialogue. And did anybody
really buy the garbage ending?
