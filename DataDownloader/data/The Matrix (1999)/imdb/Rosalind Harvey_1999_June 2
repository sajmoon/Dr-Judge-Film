1999_June 2 

Is a film that derives itself from a multitude of sources necessarily
un-original?<br /><br />For me most of the depth and colour in The Matrix was derived from the
fact
that I had an idea what it was talking when it referred to Zion or not
being
in Kansas anymore. With a screenplay and visual effects that refer not
only
to cyberpunk and SF sources (William Gibson, T2, etc) and to other
&quot;modern&quot;
cultural icons (Bruce Lee, etc) but to both literary (Alice in Wonderland,
Oz), philosophical (Plato, Nietzsche) and religious (Revelation) sources,
the film has a depth that goes far beyond anything else that I have seen.<br /><br />In drawing on the depth of it's inheritance the Matrix becomes something
novel without throwing out the baby with the bath water. It's SFX were
stunning, the visual feel a delight, but to me it was this sense of
cultural
awareness that made the film<br /><br />I would recommend The Matrix to anyone but I understand that not everyone
will like it. Yet to anyone who has grown up with Alice, Oz and Azimov and
grown into the likes of William Gibson and Neal Stephenson it is a feast
to
be savoured. In my case one which has already been savoured more than once
and will no doubt be enjoyed again.
