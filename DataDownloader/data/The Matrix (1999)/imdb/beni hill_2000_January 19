I saw the Matrix when it was released on the cinema.  I hadn't heard any
raves before I saw it - I went to see it on account of generally liking
sci-fi type stuff. You check your disbelief in at the door for this type of
movie so, given that, the basic premise of The Matrix was interesting. Also,
the slo-mo visual effects were good. However, the plot was corny, one cliche
after another. Maybe I've just seen too many movies of this type or maybe
I'm too old and jaded for this stuff at 27. The Matrix is presumably a hit
with the teen market.
