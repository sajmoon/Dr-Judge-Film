THE MATRIX is, the second release by brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (the
pair responsible for 1997's erotic and excellent thriller Bound.) This
movie
has everything from special effects, action sequences, martial arts,
amazing
stunts, a nice dollop of humour and quite amazingly in a movie of this
scale
and budget an intelligent story to tell.<br /><br />The cast all put in engaging and energetic performances. From Reeves as the
bewildered hero, to the mystical Fisburne and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity
(who is surely the sexist thing to grace the big screen in a very long
time?).<br /><br />The action sequence are all choreographed by the famed Yeung Wo Ping (who
has notably worked with Jackie Chan)  and he presides over the numerous
fight sequences between Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith with an
experts hand. He also employs the use of wire work (which help the actors
achieve those amazing leaping motions) to great effect.<br /><br />The result is a face paced and watchable action movie that doesn't ever
become tedious even if it is slightly predictable.
