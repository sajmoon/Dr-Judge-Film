I loved the Matrix--when it was a film released in 1998 called  Dark City,
a
far superior, character driven entry in the sci-fi genre. The Matrix, with
its dazzling special effects, is nothing more than a silly tale of
perseption vs reality. Everyone's view of the film seems to be manipulated
by the effects. If we were dealing with Blade Runner style effects instead
of Doritos inspired &quot;bullet time&quot; effects, would the film still be
considered as memorable? I highly doubt it. Laurence Fishburne is good as
Morpheus, Moss is ok but her character elicits no sympathy or emotion from
me, and Keanu Reeves is just ok, but none of these characters are as
intriguing as those of Dark City. The kung fu was obviously inspired by
the
late Hong Kong style of fighting (IE wire fu and CGI instead of actual
skills and choreography.) This was designed to make the simpletons of
today
go &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot; while real kung fu afficionados ache over the obvious
fakeness and frustration of chop editing, thus inspiring furhter kung fu
crap like CROUCHING TIGER, EXIT WOUNDS, and ROMEO MUST DIE. Matrix does
boast some wonderful cinematography, but so does Dark City and it boasts a
better story along with it, too. I'll give this film a 5 out of because in
originality it's not in the top, in style it's not original, in acting
it's
saved by one, and story, pretty basic but not complex. Dark City is
better.
