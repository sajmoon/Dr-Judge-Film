This IS the greatest movie you will likly ever see.  (that is untill The
Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions come out)  Great to watch over and over
again because you realize countless religious, philosophical, and real
world
allegories.  I'm not exactly sure why some people don't like this movie,
but
the best I can work out is that they don't understand it.  They just don't
&quot;get&quot; it.  There are sooo many people who automatically don't like a story
because it doesn't spell it out for them right away.  You might actually
have to think to fully grasp the whole of this movie.  This is hard for
some
people to do, for whatever reason.  Maybe they just weren't expecting this
from a action movie.<br /><br />I've seen many people reference to Christien connections to The Matrix.
True, true.  (names of characters, story of jesus) And all of this was put
in there on purpose.  This was the brothers' fist big project so they put
a
lot of time into fitting all of these underlying messages in.  What many
people do not know, however, is that it is actually ment to be more
budhist
than christian.  But, since the religions have similar storylines and the
majority of people that this movie reaches are Christian, people tend to
notic just the christian allegories.  I haven't even mentioned the
philosophical end.  If  you are interested, try looking into Descartes and
Kant.  If you are really interested, you can try some greek mythology,
because that is deffinetly going to show up in the next parts of the
trilogy.
