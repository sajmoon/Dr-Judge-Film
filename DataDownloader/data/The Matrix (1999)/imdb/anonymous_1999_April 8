1999_April 8 

This movie is fantastic and energizing and makes total sense.  I went with
a
group of people and we all expected to dislike it, but we all loved it --
as
does everyone else I know.  The action sequences are so great, and when
it's
over you just want to do kung fu and beat people up, but in a good way. .
