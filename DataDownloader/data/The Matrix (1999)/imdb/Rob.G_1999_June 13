Very briefly; this film has everything.  You must see it on the big screen
to take in the special effects and amazing sound tracking.  Excellent
ideas
and edge of your pants suspense; wait until you see the scene when Trinity
and Neo fire their way into the building to rescue Morpheus; go and see it
now.
