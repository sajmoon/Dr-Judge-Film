I almost did not see this film because of the preview with Keanu Reeves
saying 'Woah'.  I am thankful that I watched it anyway.  Andy and Larry
Wachowski did a superb job both writing and directing this sci-fi (or is
it?) actioner.  The cast was terrific, including Keanu Reeves.  They brought
the story bleakly, almost painfully to life.  My hack and slash buddies were
impressed with the hardware and fire power.  I thought the costumes were
outstanding.  The editing was slick and seamless and the special effects
were the star of the show.  Grade A (9)
