Keanu Reeves has finally developed a bit of real acting skill!  And he
displays it in this cinematic phantasmagoria that features some absolutely
breathtaking special effects, a marvelous story, and the best fight
sequences since some of Bruce Lee's later works!  Great musical score,
great
wardrobe, fabulous backdrops.  What can I say?  This is just one heck of a
movie!  It's the perfect combination of The Fifth Element, and one of
those
old nature documentaries with the flower blooming in sped-up motion.  Rent
it today!!!!
