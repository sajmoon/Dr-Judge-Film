When I watched The Matrix at the cinema / theatre, I came away feeling
that
the plot was corny and derivative, and that I'd seen many of the plot
elements countless times in sci-fi books.
Having owned it on DVD for a while now though, it has become one of my
favourite films.  But I wonder whether my first impressions were correct
after all.<br /><br />The film has countless gaping plot holes and inconsistencies, and many of
its underlying premises are flawed.  If you're one of those people who
have
written reviews saying it &quot;expanded your mind&quot; and &quot;made you think&quot; and is
a
&quot;frightening vision of the future&quot; then get real!<br /><br />Enjoy the film for what it is - a hugely enjoyable SFX-filled action film
with some mould-breaking FX techniques (eg. bullet time), although even
some
of these were seen in adverts and pop videos before The Matrix came out.
For example, the Schmirnoff advert.<br /><br />But please, let's not get carried away and take it all too
seriously!
