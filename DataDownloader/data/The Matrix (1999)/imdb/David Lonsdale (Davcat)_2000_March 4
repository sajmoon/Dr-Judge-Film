2000_March 4 

Just to say that this was a very well-paced film, and the special effects
were the best ever - in a day and age when this is becoming increasingly
difficult.
Could be seen as a trifle slow at first, and somewhat dialogue-bound
at
times, nonetheless becomes a gripping drama.  This is the only film I
could
place in the same league as Blade Runner - my favourite.  It needs further
viewing, as there is a lot of eye candy to take in, but the atmosphere is
superb.  Quite a few nods to other movies, I fear, but this gave it a
much-needed tongue-in-cheek overlay.
