1999_September 28 

It's unfortunate that many people disliked The Matrix.  I, however, am not
one of those people.  I thought The Matrix was phenomenal and well worth
the
time I spent watching it.<br /><br />With stunning visual effects and a well-integrated plot, The Matrix is by
far the best movie of 1999.  I believe the character Neo was well suited
for
Keanu Reeves' acting style who did a wonderful job.  Moss, Fishburne, and
Pantoliano were excellent in their portrayals of their characters.  After
seeing the movie, I saw reality in a different way.  It was empowering for
me.  I can only say that about a handful of movies.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix, this is one you won't be
disappointed
with.  It's well worth the time.
