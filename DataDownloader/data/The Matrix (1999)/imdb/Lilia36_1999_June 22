1999_June 22 

It is the best movie I've ever seen!  The effects are astounding, the
actors' martial arts techniques are perfection, and the plot well thought
out.  Personally, I was very much inspired by this movie.  It shows a
world
where there are no limits and anything is possible.
The role of Neo was perfect for Keanu Reeves because he, like Neo, has
that
mysterious aura.  It worked out very well for the movie.  Carrie Anne Ross
was empowering in her role as Trinity.  I loved her quiet
authority.
I particularly liked how there were various philosophies combined to send
an inspirational message.  Actually there were many messages the movie
sent
across.  Question &quot;reality&quot;, &quot;What is real?&quot;,  letting go of doubt and
fear
and freeing your mind, etc.  I liked when Morpheus said, &quot;...There's
something wrong with the world.  You don't know what it is, but it's
there,
like a splinter, driving you mad.&quot;  The movie brings up a lot of questions
about reality.
Please, if you haven't seen it yet, GO SEE IT!!!  It's well worth the
money
even if you're not into science fiction.  It makes you think.
