The Matrix was overall a good movie.  The problems with it were that some
parts were trying too be too cool, and some of the science fiction ideas
were unbelievable/impossible.
This movie has many good points, though.  The plot is very good, and the
movie was just plain entertaining.  Overall, The Matrix is a good movie,
but
it has some relatively minor flaws.
