Hi!
My name is Fabiana and I go to a Christian School where Bible class is
mandatory. In the past week and a half my class watched the film &quot;The
Matrix&quot;, from which we learned parallels relating from the film to the
Bible
and quite a lot of Christian symbolism.<br /><br />Neo, aka &quot;The One&quot; is just like Jesus because He too was &quot;The One&quot;.
Another
parallel between Jesus and Neo is that they both were trained, except in
different ways. Neo was trained on a machine and Jesus was tempted in a
desert by fasting. I have found a Bible referance to prove my point,
Luke4:1,2.
At the end of the movie Neo jumps into on of the Demons and ends up
killing
it. What I find quite ironic is how jesus casts out Demons, which is
quite
similar to how Neo killed the Demon. Luke11:20 explains
this.<br /><br />Cypher, I found is just like Judas because they both betrayed Neo/Jesus.
Cypher betrayed Neo by trying to kill him and not bring him back from the
Matrix. Matthew26:47-51 is a good referance which shows how Judas
betrayed
Jesus.<br /><br />One extraordinary parallel is the option of the 2 pills offered by
Morpheus
to Neo. One pill is red which is for Life and the other is blue for
Death.
In the Bible, it says you will have eternal life if you follow Christ,
but
if you don't and follow the World, that means Death. John3:16 explains
this
clearly.<br /><br />These are just a few of the parallels that have been shown in the film.
My
class came up with a lot more, but I found these that I have written
about
the most interesting.
