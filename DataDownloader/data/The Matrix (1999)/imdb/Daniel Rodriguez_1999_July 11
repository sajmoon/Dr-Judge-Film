I've always loved science fiction and I'm always been able to forget the
little scientific violations. But I hate when someone pretends to make me
forget about logic.<br /><br />The Matrix is just an impossible concept. You can forget the technology
involved, you can think (as you do in Star Wars, for example) that the
science has evolved enough. But you can't accept when they try to say that
A
and NOT A are true at the same time. You can't have millions of people
(with
different ages) living in the same unreal world if it doesn't evolve, if
it's always at the end of the 20th century. You can do it by making a
special Matrix for every human being (destroying the plot) or making the
humans forget every 10 years (destroying the plot).<br /><br />Good special effects. It's the best I can say about this movie. It's not
too
much.
