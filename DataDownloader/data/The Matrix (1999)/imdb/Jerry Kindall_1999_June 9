1999_June 9 

The people who made this movie were smart enough to give Keanu short, easy
lines. No deep philosophical discussions for Neo, but rather one-word
utterances like &quot;Whoa.&quot; He did much better in this movie than in any other
I've seen him in. The first third of the movie, including the setup, was a
bit slow, but then it kicked into high gear. The Wachowski brothers out
Cameroned James Cameron with the lobby sequence.<br /><br />I was rather disappointed, though, that the premise and its implications
weren't worked out with more rigor. A few changes there, and the movie
would
have been _just_ as good from an action standpoint but would have pleased
all of us anal retentive types who actually expect movies to make sense.
For
one thing, the entire thing about the machines' motivation for creating
the
Matrix was just dumb, and I can imagine a much better way to set that up.
I
would also have preferred to have the movie take place almost entirely in
the Matrix, not in the Real World.<br /><br />Still, above-average eye candy. Worth seeing at a matinee or on
video.
