1999_April 7 

&quot;The Matrix&quot; had an interesting (if far-fetched) story, jaw-dropping special
effects and some great action, but it's not that great of a film.  Two
reasons for this: the plot...it's too complex and a lot of meaningless
details are thrown in and conservations are pointlessly drawn out.  The film
could have ended at least 20 minutes sooner.  The second and most severe
problem...Keanu Reeves.  This is a real problem considering
he's the lead and is supposed to show emotions and feelings.  Instead he's
totally blank, and it put me at a distance from him.  So &quot;The Matrix&quot; is
worth seeing for the special effects and interesting plot, but Reeves' lousy
performance stops it from being what could have been a great sci-fi movie.
