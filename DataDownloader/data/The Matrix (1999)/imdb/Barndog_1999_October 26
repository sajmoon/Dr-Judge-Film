If you are a Sci-Fi movie fan desperately looking for something good to
watch, or an action movie fan wanting artistic shooting scenes that would
make John Woo proud or martial arts cut directly out of the best kung-fu
movies, this is the movie for you.
I never thought Keanu Reeves would find a role that suited him better than
idiot Ted from Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure. I am impressed as
hell.
In summary, unless you hate great stories that make you think and kick ass
action, see this movie! You won't be disappointed!
