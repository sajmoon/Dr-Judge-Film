I am not normally a fan of Keanu Reeves and his films but I found the Matrix
to be very good. The plot is deeper than I expected. This moves subtly
addresses the issue that what we consider to be reality is not the actual
reality but simply our own personal construct, which is the basis of some
important eastern philosophies. I believe the incorporation of kung fu into
the movie was a &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to eastern philosophy and not just added
for action. At any rate, this is a good movie for those interested in
martial arts, sci-fi, special effects, and eastern religion.
