whoa. that's about it in a nutshell. the special fx are so
incredibly ahead of the times...and i'm amazed at what the
actors went through to portray their roles! i knew keanu had
a neck brace through most of the training in late '97, but
had no idea how many physical injuries actually happened.
and after seeing this movie so many times, i can only pick
up more and more of the abstract meanings behind it - or
maybe i'm reading to much in it...and props to the bros for
using chicago :). cannot wait for the sequels to film on
location - once again, i will be there, trying to get the best
view of mr. reeves. :)
