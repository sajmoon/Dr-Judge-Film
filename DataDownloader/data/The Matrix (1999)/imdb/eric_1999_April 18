The Matrix is the best movie I have ever seen.  It was amazing for the
special effects.  It also made you think.  Can we choose our own path in
life or are we pre-destined to do certain things and make certain
decisions.
Reeves deserves some props for portraying the reluctant hero, Neo.
Fishburne as Morpheus almost gets lost in the shuffle because the role he
plays is not as flashy as the others.  Hugo Weaving did a great job as
agent
Smith.  His relentless search for Morpheus was reminiscent of the search
for Richard Kimble on the series The Fugitve. Carrie-Anne Moss also
deserves
a shout out for her portrayal of Trinity.  Best of all, however, was when
Reeves realizes that he is &quot;the one&quot; and you recall the final fight scene
in
The Last Dragon.  This is one of the few movies that is worth the price of
admission two or three times.
