Caution: If you haven't seen this movie, don't read my review, it'll only
create conflict in your mind when you view it...<br /><br />With that said...
The Matrix provides one of the most powerful symbols of Christ's return in
a
futuristic setting.  Writers of the matrix felt that to aid the the common
movie goer, they would name one of the characters &quot;trinity.&quot;  How
convienient = )<br /><br />Such an odd name, but not out of context.  It becomes obvious that Keanu
Reeves is the modern day Jesus Christ as he defies the laws of gravity,
physics, and eventually reality.  As he gains support and training from his
apostles, he becomes a powerful fighter in the attempt to free mankind from
ultimate slavery.  He is the &quot;chosen one&quot; that will deliver us from
slavery.
He is saved by Trinity, who proves that love is the only power greater
than
all mankind.<br /><br />Consider how you view his actions carefully though.  As Keanu Reeves
slaughters mindless SWAT agents he drives farther and farther from what one
might consider to be the teachings of Jesus.  But, movies need audiences,
and what could be better than the Son of God returning to a computerized
world, freeing slaves and kicking some major booty.<br /><br />As an action flick The Matrix is unsurpassed... we get explosions, hand to
hand combat, helicopters, and of course,
guns, lots of guns.<br /><br />The only city left protected from the mechanical death... Zion... of
course,
just a tidbit<br /><br />I suggest that you go and watch The Matrix again, i've seen it about 9
times, and look for the symbolism involved.  Its pretty interesting when
you
do...
