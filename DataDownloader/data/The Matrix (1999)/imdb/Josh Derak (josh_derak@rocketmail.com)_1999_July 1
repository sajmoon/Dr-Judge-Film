1999_July 1 

Like any action film, special effects are all over and the plot is
outrageous. Keanu plays a guy who wants to know what the Matrix is for some
strange reason. He sure finds out.
Through most of the movie, I had the feeling that the director likes Bruce
Lee. Most of the movie didn't really make any sense. Why would Keanu's
character need to learn martial arts to fight in a world that doesn't
really
exist? He could just think something and it would happen.
Technically, this is just a Kung Fu movie but with special effects and a
goofy 'is this world real' premise.
I did like this movie even though it doesn't make too much sense. Also, the
obvious Nokia cellphone advertisements were obnoxious.
