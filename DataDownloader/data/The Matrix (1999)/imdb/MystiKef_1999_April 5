The Matrix is an incredible movie in so many aspects.<br /><br />The writing and direction are superb.  The story line is very complex and
deep, but explained in to understanding.  The humor is great, without
becoming cheesy.<br /><br />And then, there are the special effects...  They will blow you
away.<br /><br />I gave this movie a top rating.  I can't wait to see it again.  DO NOT miss
this one on the big screen.
