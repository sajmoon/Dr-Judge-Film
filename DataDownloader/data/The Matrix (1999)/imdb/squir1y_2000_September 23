2000_September 23 

This is the only review I've written so far that was based on a movie that I
didn't finish watching. I found the first half to be pretty dull so I turned
it off. In it's defense it had good visual effects but nothing much more.
Keanu Reeves is still not a good actor. In fact I only liked him in Speed
and Bill and Ted. I didn't feel it deserved those Oscars though, because I
thought The Phantom Menace had better effects, not to mention being a much,
much better movie. I think this was just a weak attempt to beat Star Wars at
the box office. And why are they making two sequels? To make a good sequel
you have to have a good movie to base it on. Next to South Park, Austin
Powers 2, Blair Witch and Wild, Wild West this was the worst movie of last
year. If you want to see some of last year's best, see The Phantom Menace,
American Pie, Detroit Rock City or Bowfinger. But avoid the Matrix unless
you just want a good visual effects movie. 1/10
