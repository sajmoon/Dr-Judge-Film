1999_June 14 

Over here in little old England, something of a storm is brewing. The
streets have seemed strangely deserted of late, and people have a eerie
expectancy about them. No, it's not 'That Film' (Star Wars Episode I
doesn't
come out over here until July 1999) - in fact, most people are watching
the
Matrix, which could be the biggest surprise smash of the year. Already
proven its worth in the US box office, it had got myself and a few friends
whipped up into something of a sci-fi frenzy with trailers spouting
unprecedented camerawork and visual effects. We managed to get ourselves
into a preview showing a day before the opening weekend. It cost a little
more, but, oh boy. Was it worth it.<br /><br />The Matrix stars Keanu Reeves as Neo, a small-time software programmer by
day, and a solitary computer-cracking software pirate by night. Apart from
the occasional nightmare, nothing troubles Neo until a strange encounter
with a woman (Trinity), and a nasty run-in with FBI-style agents force him
to start asking questions - are his dreams real? Who is Morpheus? And just
what is the Matrix? Confused yet? More I cannot say (you find out about 30
minutes in), except this: if this film is a rollacoaster, this far is the
gentle climb up the first ramp to the top. Get ready for a whirlwind
ride.<br /><br />Many people will go to see this film because of the gun-toting,
spine-tingling effects shots. The camerawork is ground-breaking and
un-surpassed. The 'Flo-mo' technology, used for clever spinning
slow-motion
shots, is surely set to be a regular feature on our movie screens due to
the
huge fat atmosphere it gives to stunts and explosion scenes. Others will
love the superb kung-fu action scenes, practiced for months by the cast
with
a technique known as 'wire-fighting'. These scenes (I am assured by my
Tae-Kwon-Do toting friend) are all genuinely performed and accurate to the
art. Others will love the potent plot which, while admittedly recycled
from
hard-core sci-fi, is given a firm twist of freshness and is guaranteed to
turn your head inside out at least twice during the film.<br /><br />For myself, I simply loved The Matrix because, well, it was so darn cool.
From the the fantastic camera work and the impeccable fashion sense to the
fresh, exciting plot, it looks set to be at least as popular over in the
UK
as it proved to be in the US. The faults were few and far between - an
awkward romance and some slightly wooden &quot;Keanu moments&quot; being the only
ones
I can remember.<br /><br />But the minor niggles don't begin to mar the quality of the film. I came
out of the theatre feeling at least a half foot taller for knowing
something
just about no-one else did - what the Matrix actually was. But, in the
words
of Morpheus: &quot;Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the Matrix actually
is.
You have to see it for yourself.&quot;
