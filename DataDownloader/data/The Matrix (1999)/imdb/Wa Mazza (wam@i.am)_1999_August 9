1999_August 9 

The last best movie of the Millennium! Great plot, great script, stunning
effects, trenchant acting. From the word go you are gripped and not put
down
again until you wake up the next morning... or do you really wake up the
next morning!? You'll see what I mean, as long as you watch this &quot;must see
twice&quot; movie.
