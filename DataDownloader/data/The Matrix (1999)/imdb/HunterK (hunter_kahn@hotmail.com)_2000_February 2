At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing
any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I
enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the
fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by
the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out
everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really
understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.<br /><br />I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very
interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was
Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence
Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an
excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as
well.<br /><br />The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant
by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we
know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by
robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only
that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going
to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo
does, so you can really relate to his character.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you
watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like
this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone
who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.
