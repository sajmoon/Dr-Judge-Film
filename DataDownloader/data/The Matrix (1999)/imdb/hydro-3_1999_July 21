Wow, the work and detail they put into this movie was extravagant. The name
of each main character in a story represented their attitude and outlook
and
foreshadowed what would become of them. The animation and graphics were
awesome. Nice frames and use of camera tricks creating the illusions of
different special effects. The basic outline and plot of the story was
amazing in itself. It grabs you from the beginning and takes your mind on a
wild ride of &quot;what if's.&quot; Not only is it great entertainment, but you'll
never look at life the same way again. All in all, -wonderful- movie. A
definite 'gotta see.'
