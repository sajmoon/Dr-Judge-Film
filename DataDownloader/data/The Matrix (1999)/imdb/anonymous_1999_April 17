1999_April 17 

Over the past couple of weeks all I have been hearing about is how great
the
Matrix is, so I decided to see it for my self. It has probably some of the
best eye candy I have ever seen, next to Starship Troopers. The entire
plot
and story line was well crafted and the characters were very likeable, but
it seemed to lack something that I still can't put my finger on.  BOTTOM
LINE- See it in the theater while you still can, the special effects are
amazing. 7.5 out of 10
