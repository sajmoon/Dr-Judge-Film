1999_May 31 

Matrix is not the greatest film ever made , but is visual spectacular , go
along and just sit and don't go and  try to find meaning in this , just
sit
there and enjoy it ..Oh and how Wonderful Sydney, Australia looked on the
big screen as a back drop , it makes a refreshing change From U.S.A , lets
hope we see more of Sydney in future films, as I heard that city is where
the new Mission Impossible is filmed and the next two Star Wars Episodes
are
being made.
