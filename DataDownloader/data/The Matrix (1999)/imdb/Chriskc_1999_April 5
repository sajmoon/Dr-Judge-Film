The Matrix was much better than I expected.  The special effects were very
impressive but in The Matrix, they complimented the move rather than being
the whole point of the movie.  The story, whether you buy into it or not,
holds together and you can actually follow and understand why things happen.
This is a well executed story that doesn't let a lot of extraneous BS get
in the way.
A must see for any S.F. fan.
