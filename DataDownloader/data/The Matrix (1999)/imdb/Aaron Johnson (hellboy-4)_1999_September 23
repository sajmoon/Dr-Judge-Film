1999_September 23 

I missed this in the theater and man Im glad I did.  I can't believe the
lack of originality in this movie.  The special effects werent enough to
hold my interest.  Dark City and Blade both surpass this movie in every way,
the prior for story and the latter for action.  Every thing about this movie
was cliche and the ending...can anyone say sleeping beauty!!  It was a good
movie but not ground breaking, the sci-fi world has seen better and so have
I.
