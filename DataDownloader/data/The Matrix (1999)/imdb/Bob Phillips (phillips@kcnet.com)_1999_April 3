1999_April 3 

This movie is about as close to a William Gibson (science fiction Hugo
award
winning) cyberpunk novel put on a screen as one could imagine.  It's not
written by Gibson, but seems like it could have been.  The virtual reality
is almost perfect.<br /><br />I had read that the plot was thin and the middle third slow.  The plot is
just fine for an action film and the pacing throughout was just right in
my
opinion.  I wish it had been longer.  I hope it makes a fortune so more
like
it will be produced.<br /><br />My eleven year old son and his friend also thought it was great.   My
son's
first comment was; &quot;Dad, we have to get this video when it comes out.&quot;  I
agreed.  To put that in context, when we saw &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, his comment
was - &quot;That sure was boring.&quot;<br /><br />The movie is rated R and there's quite a bit of video arcade/action style
violence.  There is also a scene at the beginning that I thought might
produce nightmares for a kid - shoot, maybe even for an adult.  So don't
take children much younger than 11 or children who you do not want exposed
to violence.<br /><br />The evil guy, Mr. Smith, is nearly perfect for the role and the role is
just
right for the movie.  Kudos also to the two lead actors and actress.
Actually, a lady who shows up in the middle of the movie pretty much
steals
the scene she's in.<br /><br />
