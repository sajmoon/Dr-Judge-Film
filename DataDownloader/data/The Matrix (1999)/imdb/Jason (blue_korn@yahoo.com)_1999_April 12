1999_April 12 

This movie was excellent. Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski are two of the
greatest writers and directors I've seen in a long time. The shots were the
best, the special effects were trippy, and mind-blowing, and the writing was
intriguing and pure brilliance. Go see this movie. If you already have, go
again.
