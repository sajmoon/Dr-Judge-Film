Andy and Larry Wachowski have come up with an ingenious movie that will
want
you pleading for more. Keanu Reeves plays Neo who is in search of the truth
and Laurence Fishburne is Morphius the man who knows how to get
it.<br /><br />Superb action sequences make this movie an instant classic, not just in the
sci-fi genre but in movie history. The slow motion gun fights are
innovative
and ground breaking and I was in awe from the moment I began to watch. The
kung fu fighting is as good as that of a Bruce Lee movie.<br /><br />The Matrix is one of the most innovative and riveting movies ever and I
would recommend this to anyone with a open mind and a love of
sci-fi.
