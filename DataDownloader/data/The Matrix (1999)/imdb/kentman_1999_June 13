1999_June 13 

Excellent Sci-fi for the thinking man (or woman). A good story with decent
characterisation, Keanu Reeves best role for some time. Good supporting
cast
in particular the Men in Black lookalikes.<br /><br />Very atmospheric with good use of dark and light, reminded me of the pilot
of Max Headroom.<br /><br />The effects need to be seen to be believed, but they do not steal the show
like so many other films. The story can be a bit difficult to follow but
perseverance is rewarded in the end.<br /><br />At 130+ mins it is a long film, be sure to visit a comfortable venue, but a
good pace on the action and story telling holds the viewer from start to
finish.<br /><br />10 out of 10 for an original slant on the &quot;computers take over the world&quot;
theme.<br /><br />Will there be a sequel.......... I hope so.
