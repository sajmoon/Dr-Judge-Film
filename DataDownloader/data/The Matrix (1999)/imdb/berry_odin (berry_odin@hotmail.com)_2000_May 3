Where shall I begin? Great acting? Great Special Effects? Great story? This
movie is to good to be true! I never expected it to be so good. I have seen
it 10 times, but I still enjoy it, like seeing it for the first time. Every
actor in perfectly cast for his/her role. I really liked Carrie Ann-Moss
(Trinity), because she is so cool en relaxed during the movie. Everyone has
said it, but the special effects are the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />I don't think it's a good idea to make sequels to this movie. They can never
be so good or original as this one. But we have all to wait and see.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, go rent or buy it now!!!
