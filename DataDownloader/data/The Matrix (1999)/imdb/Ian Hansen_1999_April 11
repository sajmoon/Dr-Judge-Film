1999_April 11 

It is a 10!   This movie touches on many issues that are predominant the
world over.  With amazing special effects and a sound track that still has
me reeling this film is top quality.  The costumes were especially well
done
and the characters had a sence of realism to them that is not commonly
found
in films today.   Small things hidden in the movie make return visits even
more entertaining as the viewer catches something new each visit.   On my
list of movies The Matrix takes a close second to Braveheart.   A must
see.
