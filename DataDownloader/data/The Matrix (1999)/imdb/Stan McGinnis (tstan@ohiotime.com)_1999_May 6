You must see The Matrix if you enjoy movies.  It's a very creative vision
that provides the viewer with a unique worldview as well as sensory
stimulation.
Some people don't like the movie, but there is no need to dwell on
individual things that you wouldn't like.  As a whole the movie is just
plain exciting!  Even if you don't like Keanu, just picture someone else
playing his role.  Unique twists, intentionally vague concepts and
creative
writing backup the awesome special effects.  The soundtrack rocks, too.
Although I would have preferred a little less Metal and a little more
variance.
