If you thought that this was just a great movie, then you are among the
many
who missed the fun in this movie.  If you only saw it once, you missed out
even worse!  The Matrix is a story of a hacker who has a question that only
one man can answer, but when he finds that man (or that man finds him!) he
will be propelled into something he never imagined possible....<br /><br />The Matrix, the first time is an awesome special effects, sci-fi thriller.
The second time is an above average story with several hidden twists and
meanings, the third time and every time beyond, it is a trip into the minds
of the Wachowski brothers as you try to uncover every hidden detail from
the
names of the characters, to the buildings to the dialogue.  You will love
this tastefully crafted story of inhuman-humanity that serves as a possible
premise for our future as we know it!
