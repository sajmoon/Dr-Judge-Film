1999_April 10 

It has been a while since I've seen a movie that left me unable to decide
whether I liked it or not for as long as it took me to decide on The Matrix.
Fully one hour after the movie was out, I still couldn't even think to
wonder if I liked it. The rush, however, finally subsided, and I realised
that it was one of the top movies I've seen in recent years.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays his typical role, but for once, it doesn't detract from
the overarching brilliance of the screenwriting and directing. His character
is surprisingly likable.
Laurence Fishburne absolutely kicks it as Morpheus, the one who has been
prophesied by the Oracle to find The One. He is an excellent teacher for Neo
in all aspects: personality, belief, etc.
Mad props to the Wachowski brothers on a job well done.
