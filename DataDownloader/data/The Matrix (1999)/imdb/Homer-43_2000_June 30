'The Matrix' is of course a very good Science Fiction Movie and along with
'American Beauty', 'Fight Club' and 'The Sixth Sense' one of the best of
'99, but I can't believe that this movie got into the top 50. I can't
believe that a movie classic like 'Apocalypse Now' is behind The Matrix.<br /><br />Many people say that this movie is realistic and everything in it could be
true, but I think they all forgot the oracle, the fact that there's THE ONE
and the shootout at the end. I mean in the shootout they don't do many
special moves to hide from the bullets, but they just don't get shot.
Whatever, the action sequence would have been much better if M. Manson's
'Rock Is Dead' played in the background.
I hope the sequels or prequels don't go on like the first one ended, because
I think that would suck.
But if they hold on to a good story, like the first hour of this movie was,
we can look forward to a great competition between the 2nd Star Wars and the
2nd Matrix.<br /><br />I rated this movie 9 out of 10
