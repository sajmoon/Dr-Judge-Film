2003_January 3 

This is good. I never had the chance to see it at the cinema, being only 12
at the time. But for it to be the 35th best film ever? Just ahead of The
Third Man? And I think it appeared in the top 20 on that chart on the TV as
well. It isn't that good. We won't be talking about it in 30 years. At least
I hope we won't.<br /><br />The first time you watch it. You're blown away by the action sequences, you
admire how original it it and the fact that all the actors are doing their
own stunts. But to be voted (apart from the two star wars) the best sci-fi
ever? It shouldn't, what about Bladerunner and 2001?<br /><br />After my third watching of this film, I ended up just skipping to action
sequences or to bits with Agent Smith, who seemed to be the only true
character. Thank god the agents are back in the next one (or so it would
seem from the trailers).<br /><br />I think it tried to do too much, and the ending really was AN ENDING. I
can't think of anyway that the plot could continue (unless the whole first
film turns out to be a training mission or something silly like that).
Anyway, it's good, but I think it's over-rated by fans of the
genre.
