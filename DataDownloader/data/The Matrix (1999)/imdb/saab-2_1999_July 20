1999_July 20 

Wow, what a movie. When I left the cinema, I thought, The Matrix was ok not
very good. Then I got a deja-vu feeling when I saw the commercials on the
tv, and thought what a Movie.<br /><br />The story was great and very originally, I like it ! And the special effects
made Titanic(and Leonardo Di Caprio) sink to the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean. I think I'm going to see the movie again.
