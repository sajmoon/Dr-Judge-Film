1999_April 9 

The movie is dark. Literally and figuratively. The acting is ok
considering that there's a lot of relatively unknown talent. The action
scenes are superb and the recent trend of getting Hong Kong based people
to
do slow motion action (remember Face/Off)  is exploited to the hilt. Some
of
the concepts are original although the dismal attitude towards the future
is
something that is being repeated everywhere. Some of the the ideas will
probably be true in the next few years, however
their impact may be different.
I saw Laurence Fishburne after a long time and he gives by far the best
performance. Keanu Reeves looks more convincing than he was in Johnny
Mnemonic. The others are tolerable because the special effects take over
the
rest of the movie.
If you are looking to see a movie this weekend, go see
it.
