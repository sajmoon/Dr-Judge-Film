 O.K, The Matrix is a good movie with great special effects and superb
acting. So? The story isn't that good. I don't even think that the writers
knew what they were writing about until it came for them to write
it!<br /><br /> Keanu Reeves and Larry Fishburne star in this sci fi action about &quot;a chosen
one&quot; (ooh, original!) who is faced with the task of fighting a group of
immortals who have created this blindfolded world called Earth. Its just a
creation to throw mankind of guard, and blind them to the
truth.<br /><br /> Well, all that aside, there were only a few decent moments in the whole
film that were nail biting. They were mostly all at the start where Reeves
didn't know the truth, and at the end, when he did. The middle of the film
was confusing, and hardly entertaining at all.<br /><br /> Carrie Anne Moss produces the most thrills. Her athletic escape from the
Federal looking bad guys at the start was very well done. The Matrix got
better reviews that it should have done. Its the type of movie that some
love, and some aren't sure about. Rating=3/5
