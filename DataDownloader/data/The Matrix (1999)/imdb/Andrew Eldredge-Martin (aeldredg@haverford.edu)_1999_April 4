1999_April 4 

I was expecting Reeves to be bad like usual, but not once did I catch the
patented, &quot;Dude,&quot; coming from his mouth.  It wasn't an Oscar performance but
it was not bad at all.<br /><br />The Special effects were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  I especially liked the freeze-frame
effect which was usually followed by a neat rotation of the camera viewpoint
similar to what I have seen in certain video games, but absolutely great
when done live-action.<br /><br />Surprises await!  Go see this movie.
