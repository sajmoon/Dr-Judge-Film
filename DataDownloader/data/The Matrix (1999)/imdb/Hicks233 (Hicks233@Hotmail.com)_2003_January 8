2003_January 8 

After re-watching The Matrix I am starting to enjoy it, I was a little too
harsh in my previous comment so here you are, Bad points
first.<br /><br />They should never have put a minigun into slow motion, ruins the point of
the weapon. The main problem that i had with the film is that it tried to
be
a theological story and an action film at the same time. By trying to be
one
it undermines the other. The conspiracy theory is just getting tired no
matter how much enthusiasim it is made with. There was way too much slow
motion, Hard Boiled also suffered from this, &quot;Bullet Time&quot; was a nice idea
and the technological improvements deserve credit. The idea of
intergrating
man and machine while not origional was done well. The use of a suppressd
soceity was alright but is getting boring as we know that we are monitered
blah, blah, we had that in the eighties. Also the use of Christianity gets
tiring, art as a whole was confined to religious subjects then escaped,
please don't go backwards! Unless it's Monty Python and the Holy Grail!
The
Wachowski brothers should be comended for their efforts and enthusiasim,
as
well as dry humour and style but they tried to do too much in one film. As
an action film it's stylish and cool, but as a story and drama it just
looses it's way. Also the cast were too confined as they couldnt do this
and
couldnt do that as it was for Neo to do as he is &quot;The one&quot;. This to me
what
ruined it as the supporting cast did a really good job, Trinity at the
start, operator throughout. Watch this as an action film and be bowled
over
by the effects, some really clever techniques but don't expect and easy
ride
if you try to negotiate the story, as a conspiracy story it works, as a
suppression of soceity story it works, but as a theological thriller it
fails, Keanu Reeves once again stuck in a role that gives little open
development, only in relation to the plot, how about the romance with
Trinity, or saving Morpheus.<br /><br />Special effects, do not a great movie make. They do allow you to shut down
and enjoy, but with the nature of the story it destroys what makes it
enjoyable. Just skip to the action scenes. The bit where the water
sprinklers come on made me laugh as the agents just stand there as if
&quot;Hmm,
i'm wet now - must kill Neo!&quot;<br /><br />THis fil mhas gone up in my opinion but still does not sustain all the
hype
it got. It's a good laugh and fun to watch with mates, but with religious
paralles it takes away the fun, pity. 3/10 up to 6/7 out of 10. (Good
soundtrack, pretty good action, nice concept, takes itself too seriously)
