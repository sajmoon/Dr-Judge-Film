1999_December 5 

Thought provoking, entertaining, new, fresh, a very great film. Superb
special effects that serve the story, not vice versa.<br /><br />I don't quite buy all of the symbolism attested to in these pages, but a
film like this lets you draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />See the film, search your own heart. Have you found Neo for
yourself?
