1999_April 10 

Okay - This is for all who thought that Keanu could only do cheesy
cyber-punk flicks....:
IN YOUR FACE!!!!<br /><br />The Matrix has set the standard for high, kenetic energy action flicks of
recent years...if not longer.  The special effects are......*thinks*.....I'm
not gonna even try to name what the special effects are like.  I guess the
closest that I could to is - New.  Amazing!!!<br /><br />Sure, I was going to the show with some REALLY high expectations -- What I
got exceeded these expectation four times over!<br /><br />The plot:  Well, I found it a little bit rough to get in to - the beginning
of the movie has you searching for a meaning - &quot;What is going on&quot; you ask
yourself.  But, as you quickly find out, is that this ONE question is what
propels the story the majority of the time. It's okay if you don't get it
at first - neither does the main character.  As the story progresses, so
does your knowledge of the plot...and &quot;what the MATRIX is&quot;.  It's a bit hard
to describe - but then so is the effects that accompany
it.<br /><br />The effects :  Well, I had NO idea....  I am a GREAT fan of John Woo and all
of his masterpeices.  The effects of this movie is like taking Woo's fairly
recent &quot;FACE/OFF&quot; - the &quot;super high octane&quot; gun fight scenese, and then add
about five - ten more minutes to them.  Also add in a HEALTHY dosage of
new effects and great (suspended cable) work and Whammo - you have one of
the coolest fight scene movies ever to be viewed by the movie
goer!!!<br /><br />Well...I guess I better stop drooing now....[ I think I'm gonna go see it
again!!!  Maybe tomaro??? YES!!!]<br /><br />10/10 -- MUST SEE.  (PERIOD)...
