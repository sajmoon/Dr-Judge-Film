The Matrix is a technical and special FX marvel of unbound lengths. What
they have put together here, the scenery, the colors, the lightning, the
sets, is a true masterpiece of the sci-fi genre. The story, a bit more
serious and exponentially more intelligent than the folly of Phantom Menace
released in the same year, does make you think about the privacy of our own
world. This question has always been around us, although maybe in a
different tone and not as dramatic as how The Matrix brings it out. Are we
really monitored and watched by someone? When we purchase by credit card,
make a phone call, go on the Internet, what have you, all of those signals
broadcast out, are they being monitored? It at least plants a thought in
your brain compared to some of the other recent mindless sci-fi films which
includes the aforementioned Phantom Menace and Wing Commander. There are a
few parts of the movie that were recycled from earlier films. I don't really
mind since NEARLY EVERY sci-fi film since the birth of the genre has
recycled one of the older concepts at one point or another. It's already a
known fact. Tinkering around it however and throwing in your own blend and
style is what distinguishes the new from the old.<br /><br />Every character in the film is unique, with the exception of maybe Neo who
Keanu expertly plays as another airhead. What I like about the characters is
that they work with each other well.  They rely upon each other's individual
strengths. Neo could have turned into a one man show easily for the entire
film but it took everyone to get him there and he feeds off of that.<br /><br />I'm glad that this film did so well with the awards and the box-office. It
tells you the sci-fi genre, the serious sci-fi, is still
alive.
