1999_April 3 

I had some spare time on Wednesday and decided that it would be a
great
time to see a movie.  I had seen glimpses of the movie's special effects
and
knew that Yuen Wo Ping had choreographed all of the action, and so I
thought
to myself that this wouldn't be too bad of an idea.  Well, I found that
that
was an understatement.  This movie amazed me.
In &quot;The Matrix,&quot; Keanu Reeves plays a hacker named Neo. There is a
remarkable
action sequence that opens the film, one which may be slightly confusing,
but stick with it the movie explains everything.  I don't want to spoil
the
film and as Morpheus says, &quot;Unfortunately you can not be told what the
matrix is, you must see it for yourself.&quot;  I will say this though, combine
Phillip Jose Farmer's &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; with William Gibson's
&quot;Neuromancer&quot; and throw in Hong Kong style, action, and choreography and
what you end up with is &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  This film is an action packed
spectacular and definitely lives up to the hype.
