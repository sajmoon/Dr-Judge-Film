2000_January 8 

I didn`t see this film on the big screen and tried to avoid all the reviews
so that when I bought it on DVD I could watch it without any prejudged
views.
I was not disappointed my first viewing was a barrage of sensations to both
my eyes and ears, the visual and sound effects were impressive and even on
the tenth viewing the film loses little of it`s effect.
I would recommend this film very highly.
