In common usage, hacker is generic term for a computer criminal, often
with a specific specialty in computer intrusion.Computer hacking
subculture is often referred to as the network hacker subculture or
simply the computer underground.It is common among hackers to use
aliases for the purpose of concealing identity, rather than revealing
their real names. Members of the network hacking scene are often being
stereotypically described as crackers by the academic hacker
subculture, yet see themselves as hackers and even try to include
academic hackers in what they see as one wider hacker culture, a view
harshly rejected by the academic hacker subculture itself. Instead of a
hacker &#150; cracker dichotomy, they give more emphasis to a spectrum of
different categories, such as white hat (&quot;ethical hacking&quot;), grey hat,
black hat and script kiddie. In contrast to the academic hackers, they
usually reserve the term cracker to refer to black hat hackers, or more
generally hackers with unlawful intentions. The movie takes up
advantage of the technological enhancements and it is totally good to
watch ! My website supports the movie is worthful watching .....!!!<br /><br />www.iwebforums.org
