1999_November 5 

     The Matrix is, quite frankly, one of the best movies ever made. It is
certainly the best big-budget action movie of 1999 and possibly the best
film of the entire decade (90s). <br /><br />     Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a mild mannered computer programmer by day,
hacker genius by night. He has been consumed by finding Morpheus and
uncovering the truth about the Matrix for as long as he can remember.
Morpheus is the leader of a rebel force of humans who are trying to expose
the truth of the Matrix and battle mega-computers who guard and protect it.<br /><br />  
     The actors do a great job with their roles, the plot is believable (at
least to conspiracy theorists) and not riddled with enough holes for the
Titanic to sail (or sink) through, and the special effects are incredible.
When it all comes together, you have a basically flawless movie that really
entertains. <br /><br />     So how do I describe the Matrix? To quote Morpheus, &quot;You have to
experience it for yourself&quot;.<br /><br />
