I first got interested in The Matrix when I saw a trailer for it on TV.
It looked cool and different.  I also had very little knowledge of what
the
story was about.  I decided that this film would be interesting and gave
it
a try - and I'm glad I did.  At first glance, The Matrix seems like your
everyday dumb mindless action flick with trench coat wearing madmen.  But
really it is a movie that expresses a very interesting and
thought-provoking
story that gets in your head and asks, &quot;Is my world really as it seems?&quot;
There is a little bit of modern mythology in The Matrix (like Star Wars)
and
the film also ponders about the subject of fate.  The action scenes are
also
well-done and spread out.  There are a few Kung-Fu fights, one taking
place
in a dojo with sunlight pouring in from high windows.  There is also a
gunfight that is very John Woo-esque.  The action doesn't distract from
the
story, though, and between action sequences (there are few of them, so
this
doesn't qualify as an all-out action movie) we get well-acted scenes that
flesh out the story.  All-in-all, The Matrix is good fun, but also offers
subjects that can start an interesting conversation, and give the movie a
see-it-over-and-over quality.  5 out of 5 stars.
