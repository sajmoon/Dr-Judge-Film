There are films that it is worthwhile to spend hours musing over, as to
whether the film offers any deep spiritual insights or teaches us something
new about the world.  In my opinion, this ain't one of them.  There are no
'hidden truths' to be found, no startling insights, just an amazing action
flick that on its release delivered thrills 'n' spills unlike any audiences
had seen before.<br /><br />One comment I read mentioned that audiences can 'cheer' for the hero.  I
disagree.  Keanu Reeves brings little more to the role than the ability to
look cool dressed all in black.  Not that he gives a bad performance, just
that there is little empathy there.<br /><br />In this case, though, that hardly matters.  What impresses is simply
that
we are given something new to see and not merely an uninspiring rehash of a
thousand action cliches that we've seen put to better use
elsewhere.<br /><br />In short, an awesome spectacle.<br /><br />
