1999_June 20 

Well, I was nagged to see this by my nephew who kept going time after time,
and it's OK but seriously doesn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Keanu gives his usual woodentop performance (he should just play robots
from
now on like Arnie used to do).  Nobody has a difficult job to do in this
film because they play second fiddle to the effects.<br /><br />The main problem with this long movie is that it ends just as you think
it's
about to get going (astonishing for an action flick!). The much talked
about
action scenes consist of either speeding up martial arts or slowing down
gunshots...it's not an impressive technique.  Like my old man said, if he
wants to see explosions he wants real ones, not CGI - lazy, dudes, because
the public are underwhelmed by that now.  Throw in some enormous plot
holes,
but I still give it credit for some well executed ideas.<br /><br />All in all, 6 out of 10.
