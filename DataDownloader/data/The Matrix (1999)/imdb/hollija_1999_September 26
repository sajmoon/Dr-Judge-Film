1999_September 26 

I am an American ex-pat living in the former Soviet Union (Latvia). I went
to see &quot;Matrix&quot; in spite of Keanu Reeves. I wanted to see a movie. Matrix
was in town. It was in English. So... I was blown away by the concept, as
well as Mr. Reeves. He seems to have lost his Bill and Ted's personality
(thank God) and actually did a fine job. In fact I was impressed by almost
every aspect of the movie. There were a few loose ends that needed tying
off. Other than that I give it a &quot;well worth seeing&quot;. In fact I may see it
again. The music was exceptional as well.
