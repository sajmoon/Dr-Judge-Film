I always thought that science fiction movies were great and
Matrix proved me right . the whole movie you're thinking
what is real and what is not ,and it makes your mind work the extra mile
for
you.go see this one you won't regret it .
this movie has great special effects!
Mr.Anderson(Keanu Reeves) plays a guy with two lives ,one as a programmer
in
a software company and another as a hacker named Neo.
let's just say his life gets a little complicated when
a guy named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) gets in touch with him with an
idea ,to reveal to Neo what is the Matrix.
