1999_April 6 

One of the best, most invigorating film experiences I've ever had.  This
film hits on all cylinders: it has an inventive, ingenious plot;
well-developed, sympathetic characters; and never-seen-before effects that
will blow you away.  I had to see it twice in two days just because I
couldn't get it out of my mind.<br /><br />The best thing about it is that the effects, plot and characters all work
together in perfect synergy.  This is not simply one of the countless
big-budget FX extravaganzas that have the stock, cardboard characters and
the swiss cheese plot (i.e. not only cheesy but full of holes) that exist
merely so the film-makers can impress you with their effects prowess and
show off their bells and whistles.<br /><br />In THE MATRIX, the characters compliment the plot, which compliments the
effects, which compliment the characters.   There are no more effects than
necessary and no less.  Everything fits perfectly.  This is seemless,
kick-a** entertainment, populated by characters to root for and care
about.
Further deepening the film is its Christ-like parable about someone
prophesized to save humanity, which works to great effect.<br /><br />Some will say that this movie re-uses sci-fi ideas from other films, but
the
truth is there are no new ideas in stories anymore, only fresh ways of
presenting the old ones.  This movie does that in a big way. It is a
serious
leap of the imagination (not to mention its some of the absolute coolest
stuff you'll ever see on film or anywhere else.)
