What will people say 50 years from now about the Matrix??
They'll call it a classic.  It's already a classic now.
From start to finish, it's a joyride of bullet dodging, mind-bending, a$$
kickin' special effects with the perfect people for the part.  I can't
wait
for the sequels.  The Matrix trilogy will surely be the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of the
computer generation.
