1999_April 4 

I could say a billion things about this movie that made it excellent to
watch.......  First of all when I was driving home that night after watching
the movie I started to think, boy what if all this was an actual occurrence
in our natural, everyday, boring, yet sophisticated life?  I don't know
about you, but when I watch a movie and it makes me think the way I did that
night, I knew that that was an excellent movie!
Watch this movie, if you like stright forward movies, unlike titles like &quot;The
Devils Advocate,&quot; in which Al Pacino really screws with your head, then
watch this movie.  Think for a moment that you are just a figment of a
computers hard drive, and that your whole existence is fake, and your only
source of confort in the end is that you might die some day. Wow, this movie
has turned me into some buddist monk contemplating different scenarios with
alternate possibilities.
Watch this movie, you won't regret it.
