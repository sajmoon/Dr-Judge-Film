&quot;The Matrix&quot; is among the best sci-fi films ever to come out of
Hollywood. In it, a hacker learns the truth about the nature of reality
and joins the fight for the freedom of the human race.<br /><br />On the surface, the cast might seem slightly underwhelming. I wouldn&#39;t
say that any of them are great actors, more like good actors who can
nail certain types of roles. Luckily, they all seem to have been cast
in precisely the type of role for which they are best suited. So, I
have to give the actors credit but also the casting directors.<br /><br />The action is undeniably the main selling point here. It was
breathtaking at the time and while some of the effects work doesn&#39;t
look quite as polished as the films that have followed (including the
sequels) it still retains a sense of wonder. This is definitely a film
designed with a unique style in mind.<br /><br />All of which is not to say that the script is merely an excuse to get
from one set-piece to the next. The underlying idea of the Matrix is an
interesting one and the film-makers get most of the exposition out of
the way early on so as not to slow down the later stages.<br /><br />The Wachowski&#39;s direction is solid throughout though not quite as slick
as it would become later on. Their style suits the film well and
delivers the goods in a film that&#39;s all about &#39;the look&#39;. The music is
also well-handled with some fitting soundtrack choices and a better
than average score.<br /><br />All of this makes for an essential sci-fi/action hybrid. It may be a
stylish film but that doesn&#39;t mean that it falls into the trap of
emphasizing style over substance. Definitely recommended as a film to
put your high-def system to the test.
