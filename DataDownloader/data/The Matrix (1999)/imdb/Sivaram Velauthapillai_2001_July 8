The Matrix is an action movie with excellent special effects and an
unorthodox science fiction plot. If you are an action fan, I don't need to
say no more: you HAVE to check it out. If you are looking for something
deep
this movie isn't it. Nevertheless it has spetacular fight scenes with an
interesting story so you might want to see it eventually.<br /><br />One of the things about this movie is that it has a lot of innovative
special effects and camerawork. Some of these effects have since been used
in other movies but it is still cool to see how it was originally
done.
