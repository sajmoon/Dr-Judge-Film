I first encountered this film at the UGC cinema rubery in 1999 on the
biggest screen they had (so big I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t roll it out
on the floor!) and have to admit that whilst I don&#39;t believe in the old
saying &quot;go see this on the biggest screen you can find&quot; I have to admit
I&#39;m rather glad I did.<br /><br />What this film asks is a question that everyone asks from time to time
IF THE WORLD DIDN&#39;T EXIST WHAT WOULD? Would we live in a matrix style
alternate reality where we could have more control over our everyday
existence and have control over other people or would there be a big
fat nothing. The acting is superb and the storytelling enjoyable.<br /><br />This doesn&#39;t preach to the viewer yet sets its message out in pure and
simple terms. How many of us have wondered if we didn&#39;t have a planet
earth to exist on what would there be? Would we exist in some other
form? This film attempts to answer these questions and maybe it
attempts to pose some questions too. It is very sharply observed by the
Wachowski brothers and has many fans across the globe. The performances
(even from keanu reeves, a usually below-par actor) as excellent and it
rightly received many special effects awards and plaudits.
