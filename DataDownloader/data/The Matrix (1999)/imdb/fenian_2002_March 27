The most used and talked about point in this film is the &quot;Slow Motion&quot;
fight
scenes, and ultra cool freeze - 3d turns. This makes up for 25% of the
films
rating. The plot is kinda hard to follow, but can be picked up quite
easily
after viewing a couple of times. The film highlights Keanu Reeves role as
Neo a highly skilled computer hacker, and as the story suggests ; what we
would normally class as reality, the world as it is now, is an eloborate
hoax, Reality, is infact a world of destruction, ruled by computers,
similar
to the &quot;Terminator&quot; series of films. So if you liked The Terminator, T2:
Judgement Day, and T3, you should also enjoy this film
too.
