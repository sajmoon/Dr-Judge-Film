Matrix was the first movie I bought for my new DVD player.  Now, I wish I
hadn't.  I know I'll be searching long and hard to find anything that can
exploit DVD like this movie can.  Some of the scenes were shot with over 100
(*one hundred*) cameras!  For people who think that the Sci-Fi genre is
stagnating, The Matrix will absolutely rejuvenate you!  I hope other
filmmakers see this movie and follow the white rabbit
