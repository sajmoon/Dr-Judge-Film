&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a must-see for anyone who has an interest movies.  `The
Matrix' has excellent acting/cinematography, a deep plot, character
depth/development, suspenseful/thrilling moments, incredible action
sequences with great special effects, and loads of symbolism.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Neo(Keanu Reeves) who `lives two lives'.  By day
he
is Thomas A. Anderson, a program writter for a software company.  By night
he is Neo a computer hacker who has broken many laws.  It all begins when
Neo is contacted by a mysterious man named Morpheus(Lawrence Fishburne),
who
is the leader of a rebel group.  Neo is then told the true nature of his
reality.  All of the characters are portrayed excellently and are in no way
your ordinary heros and villains.  Contrary to popular belief `The Matrix'
did NOT rip-off `Dark City'.  There are a few similarities but not enough
the mean anything.<br /><br />`The Matrix' proves that plot can aid action sequences.  Similar special
effects are used in different movies but never had an explanation.  The
martial arts scenes are done rather well considering none of the actors
actually knew much martial arts.  The wirework is done excellently with
only
one noticeable flaw: the characters go flying back too slow and their feet
shake.  All of the fight scenes are choreographed to near-perfection.<br /><br />Overall `The Matrix' is a masterpiece. Almost anyone who sees it with an
open mind and understands the plot will like it.  I've heard various
reasons
why people say they didn't like it.  Many say they don't like it because it
is too fake or unrealistic.  They need to realize that it's a science
fiction movie and that nothing said `Based on a true story.'  Others say
the
plot is bad.  If they say that I doubt they understood it.  Many don't like
Keanu Reeves. Well true that he hasn't had many great performances but his
performance is exceptional in `The Matrix'.<br /><br />In the end `The Matrix' is probably the deepest, most entertaining, and
most
exceptional movie you can watch and will keep you captivated the whole
time,
then keep bringing you back to watch it again and again.
