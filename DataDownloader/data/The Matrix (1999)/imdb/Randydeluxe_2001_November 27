This is one of the greatest movies of all time, and not due to the fact
that
it's got a really wide range of appeal, because it doesn't.  People who
live
for the next little dud that only shows in two cities in the U.S. and will
never be seen by more than a hundred pompous people should stay
away.<br /><br />The Matrix is great due to the fact that among action films, it is so much
better than anything else in the genre.  Perfect!
