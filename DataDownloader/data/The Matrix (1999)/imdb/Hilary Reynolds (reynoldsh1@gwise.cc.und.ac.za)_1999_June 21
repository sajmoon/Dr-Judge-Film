1999_June 21 

This film is without doubt one of the premier science fiction films of the
1990's
and must rank along side films such as Blade Runner and Forbidden
Planet.<br /><br />While it is not the intellectual giant that some people feel it is, it is
provocative and disturbing. The concept of humans becoming battery's for
machines is a perspective which turns on its head, our perceptions of
ourselves as inviolate organisms.<br /><br />In addition to the plot, the action sequences and special effects were in
a
class apart, which also makes this movie one helluva ride. The viewer is
taken on a discovery of the Matrix which progresses with Neo's discovery
of
it, and this involves one in the film far more that is the norm for films.
The cast are without exception excellent, in particular Laurence
Fishburne,
who always is.<br /><br />Seldom has a movie absorbed me as much as this one. After my friends had
hyped it so much, I was afraid I would be disappointed, but it's a 10 out
of
10.
