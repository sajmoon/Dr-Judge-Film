I saw most of the new Movies that came out in 1999.  The Matrix was the best
and it is my favorite movie.  The story is very interesting and suspenseful
and the special effects are spectacular. The directing and editing is also
spectacular.  The film almost makes you feel you are seeing comic book
action in real life.  The angles of the shots, and action is quite unique. 
I think the Matrix should have been a finalist for the Oscar's best film of
the year.
