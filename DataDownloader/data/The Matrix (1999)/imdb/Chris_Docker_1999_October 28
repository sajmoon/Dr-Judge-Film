One of my all-time favourite sci-fi films. Like Bladerunner, it's
refreshing
to get a sci-fi movie that doesn't have all the spin-offs for kids (such as
plague star wars movies). The plot is also sufficiently intellectually
challenging to keep an adult audience riveted - and the special effects are
not only state of the art but used to support the story rather than
distract
from it.
