My favorite film and i don&#x27;t think it will change for a very long time.
If you&#x27;ve never seen it run to the store and BUY it. But if you&#x27;re the
type that likes doing other things while watching a movie then don&#x27;t
watch it. I really love this film and can&#x27;t stand to see low ratings
just because people didn&#x27;t sit there long enough to understand it. To
me when I first watched it i couldn&#x27;t get enough of it. It was so
creative and interesting that I didn&#x27;t want it to end if there is such
a thing. I was addicted to it for like a week. They never should have
made those degrading sequels. I hate them. I wish I never watched them.
How could you make the most brilliant movie and follow it up by two
dumb ones. Well that&#x27;s what happens when you add bunch of unnecessary
crap so you can divide them into two movies. Don&#x27;t these directors have
any sense of responsibility to the fans. Is everything about money damn
it. Oh yeah, it is.
