As long as you go into the theater without expecting anything along the
lines of acting, dialog, and plot, you will enjoy this movie. The look,
sound, and feel of the movie is consistently engaging and exhilarating. This
is definitely a movie that must be seen in a theater, as it will become
absolutely worthless as a video rental. If you want to a movie with some
intelligence, while maintaining a similar theme and excellent visual
effects, &quot;Dark City&quot; is the one to see.
