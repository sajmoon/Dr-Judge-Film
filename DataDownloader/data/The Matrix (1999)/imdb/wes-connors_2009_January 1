Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas &quot;Neo&quot; Anderson )
lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith)
tells him, &quot;You&#39;ve been living two lives. In one life, you&#39;re Thomas A.
Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a
social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady
carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you
go by the hacker alias &#39;Neo&#39; and are guilty of virtually every computer
crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of
them does not.&quot; That&#39;s a good description. <br /><br />Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the
intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through
seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr.
Fishburne believes Reeves just may be &quot;The One&quot;. Mr. Weaving captures
Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves
instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss&#39; assistance escapes
from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he
learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski
brothers.<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately, nobody can be told what &#39;The Matrix&#39; is. You have to
see it for yourself.&quot; <br /><br />I watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next...<br /><br />A stunning audio-visual achievement.<br /><br />********* The Matrix (1999) Larry &amp; Andy Wachowski ~ Keanu Reeves,
Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving
