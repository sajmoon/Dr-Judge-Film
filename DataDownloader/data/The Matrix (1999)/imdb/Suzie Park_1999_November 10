1999_November 10 

I'm pissed I missed this in the theaters (due to my own misguided cynicism
about recent sci-fi movies). I am flabbergasted by the words uttered in
this
film, amazed at the visual effects. Just everything came together in this
film, even wardrobe. What is even more amazing is that this film was made
for $63 mil. What a bargain.<br /><br />Looking forward to future films from these writers/directors. Fabulous.
Tremendous. I feel the testosterone kicking up a storm within. Give me more
film!
