Good Film.  For the first half of the movie I had to remind myself that this
is a science fiction story. The visuals or *special effects* really start to
put it into place.. Those scenes by the way were just too cool to watch... 
I guess I liked the story overall but kept wondering out loud sometimes 
about the story... But then thats more what a Science Fiction story is all
about.  Overall though it was a neat film to watch.<br /><br />
