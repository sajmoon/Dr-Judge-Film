1999_September 5 
... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as
well as big,
dumb, lumbering things like &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;,
and
a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.<br /><br />Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have
heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality
world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality
world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard
that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have
heard the word &quot;cyberpunk&quot; being used, with the odd allusion to films like
&quot;The Ghost in the Shell&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;; but it's NOT pretentious,
deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite
charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute
computer
gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.<br /><br />The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim
that
there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he
plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his
life,
with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't
worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well
is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half
being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot
synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one
or
two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence
was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.<br /><br />Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen
computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a
movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but
attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best.
Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used
to
make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George
Lucas made in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, that software alone will do the trick.
And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of
technology
favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague
phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply
wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply
wrong.<br /><br />Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after
two
fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY
synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when
it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining
one
or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has
been
around for a while, and I only noticed it now because &quot;The Matrix&quot;, unlike
the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves
better.
