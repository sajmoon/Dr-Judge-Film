1999_August 26 

First of all I liked the movie very much. Why? For several reasons. First, I
generally like this kind of movies. Second, I personally enjoyed to 'catch
out' subtleties and associations concerning other movies or books. Third, I
liked the philosophy in the film, more even than the action scenes. And,
fourth of the reasons is that I understand quite well the problems Mr.
Anderson dealt with in his regular job :)
The thing most amazing was that in this movie it was almost impossible to
tell what is going to happen in the next minute... Some movies are perfectly
predictable - this one is not. Almost.
I would also make the end slightly different, but this one was also
thrilling.
Hugo Weaving is perfect in his role.
The Wachowski team did some really good work. I feel afraid to wait for
Matrix II - somehow I don't believe it is going to be as good as this one
is. I hope, however, that I'm wrong.
