1999_April 5 

After word-of-mouth spread like wildfire days after its release, I prepared
to be blown away by this film, and I was.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is probably the best
sf film since Blade Runner (with the possible exception of Dark City), and
beyond a shadow of a doubt the best non-Cameron sci-fi action flick EVER.<br /><br />The film is ambitious on practically every level.  Visually it's nothing
less than the best eye-candy ever.  The basic premise may be nothing new (a
friend of mine wrote a sf short story with a nearly identical premise when
he was in high school!), but it's treated with such inventiveness and style
that it seems compelling and fresh.  The action sequences play out just like
anime, right down to the slow-motion shots and sudden, violent
action.<br /><br />Any fan of sci-fi action absolutely should not miss this.  Neither should
anyone who enjoys visual style and impact.
