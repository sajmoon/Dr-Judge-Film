To tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting anything from the movie. In fact
I
was quite apprehensive 'bout watching it. But boy did I enjoy
it!
Quite a solid story-line if not accurate, but it did the job nicely. This
is
one of those movies that just come out of nowhere and surprise the socks
of
your feet. For me The Matrix deserves 10/10 period.
