Dazzling, highly original, high-tech action movie from the Wachowski
brothers about an elusive computer hacker who&#39;s spent years living with
an uneasy feeling that the world is not quite what it seems. He&#39;s
right, and with the tutelage of a wise and mysterious outlaw
(Fishburne), he discovers that reality is just an illusion created by
living machines who&#39;ve taken control of the human race. Gripping,
high-energy actioner is filled with creative and clever ideas
(sometimes too many for its own good) with spectacular, eye-popping
visual effects and mind-blowing fight scenes as an added bonus. You
can&#39;t be told how good it is, you have to see it for yourself. ***&frac12;
