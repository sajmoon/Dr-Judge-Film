Whether or not the biblical parallels from the Matrix to the Bible
were intentional or not, there are many, and they are rather obvious.
The
main character of Neo is in fact a Jesus Christ like character in that he
came into the world to save it from itself, Neo was the chosen one and
had
control over the matrix with whatever he saw fit&iexcl;Kthe character Jesus
Christ
from the Bible has the same abilities and power.  Neo has a rebirth into
the real world, just as Jesus was baptized (Christian rebirth).  However,
the story of the Matrix is further ahead than the Story of Jesus Christ.
In
the Story of the Matrix, there was first a man who could control the
matrix
and do whatever he saw fit, after he died the Oracle prophesied his
return,
just as after Jesus Christ died for us, his return is being await by
thousands of believers around the globe. Neo is the return of that man,
fulfilling the prophesy made by the Oracle.
The Matrix itself represents other religions and beliefs that hinders and
blinds us from the truth and reality of life. Neo has come to set us free
from that blindness, just as Jesus has come to set us free from the sin
that
blinds us. The Character of Morphius was a parallel to the biblical
character of John the Baptist (the one who found Jesus and baptized him).
The rest of the crew on the ship are the disciples fallowing Neo. The
Character Sipher betrays the one for his own personal gain, just as Judas
betrayed Jesus Christ for a few pieces of silver.
The Matrix and the story of Christ line up in many ways, they parallel
each
other and contain many similarities within the fundamentals and fabric of
the two stories.
