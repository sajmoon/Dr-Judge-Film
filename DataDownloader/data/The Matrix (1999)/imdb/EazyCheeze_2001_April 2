Yes, though I am a Classic Trekkie, I think even the best classic Trek
movie, Star Trek II, pales in comparison to this great piece of plastic
(we
own it on DVD, lucky us).<br /><br />The story was somewhat original when it first came out: Neo, a man living
in
what he thinks is the real world, comes to the realization (with the help
of
Morpheus and his colleagues) that he's living in a computer-generated
simulation, to keep his mind busy and unaware while the evil Machines use
his body and the bodies of billions of others as power
source.<br /><br />Well, that's the basic storyline, and it's one with very awesome
potential.
Of course, Neo and his buddies whoop up on their enemies; I won't tell
you
how... I will let you be blown away by the direction and wire-work, not
to
mention the special effects (Bullet time! You have to see it to
understand
it completely).<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel, but it looks like I'll have to (come on,
2002,
get here quickly! I also need to watch SWEp2! And the sequel to X-Men,
and
so many other great ones :) )
