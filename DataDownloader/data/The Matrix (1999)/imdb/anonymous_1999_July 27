1999_July 27 

ok. pretty big statement, right? movie of the year? you may be saying,
&quot;you've got to be kidding, right?&quot;....well, no, I'm not.<br /><br />First, look at the ingenious special effects. they're new, they're
exciting, they looked real... have you ever seen anything so amazing
(granite, star wars was cool, but even a few of the special effects almost
resembled cartoonish images)?....now, observe MTV as to how many videos are
copying this new and incredible technique of still shots with a camera
wrapping around it. For example, how about Eminem's new
video?
Second, the original plot...look folks, this is science FICTION!! not
non-fiction...so, to those of you who whine about the movie appearing as
&quot;fake&quot; or &quot;that could never happen&quot;...well, i've got news for you, it's not
SUPPOSED to be real. i won't reveal anything, but, trust me...it's worth the
money, people!! Trust me!
Third, the Biblical Undertones....ok, those who don't believe in the
existence of God, just read it anyway! When you see the movie, look for the
biblical hidden-meanings that the Warshowski brothers so innocently put in
there. you'll be amazed by the similarities...to start you off: just think
of Reeves' character as Jesus, and Fishbourne's character as John the
Baptist. Also
Fourth, the new standards set by the science fiction/action
industry...this movie will push other movies to be as creative and flawless
as this one. 
There are more reasons, but you'll have to email me...that way, i can
discuss the plot further with you     :-)
