The Matrix isn't for everyone, granted - the plot takes a long and winding
road to its resolution.  If you're the kind of person who can't sit and
pay
attention to something for two hours, then The Matrix isn't for you.  Go
watch a commercial.<br /><br />Just because it makes heavy use of special effects doesn't automatically
make it an &quot;effects film&quot; - to the contrary, The Matrix is one of the few
films that incorporates an intelligent plot with excellent special
effects.
