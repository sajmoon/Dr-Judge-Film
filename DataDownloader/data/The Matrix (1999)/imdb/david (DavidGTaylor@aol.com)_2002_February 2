The Matrix is one of the most over-rated Sci-Fi movies of all time. Star
Wars Episode 1 was horrible. The Matrix was worse. It had some of the
worst
actors in it. Laurence Fishburne, Keanu Reeves. It was just stupid. THe
dialogue was recycled and dull. The special effects were good. Some story
elements were interesting, but as a whole, the movie was a big stupid
piece
of Hollywood crap. It ripped off Aliens, and Star Wars and so many other
movies, its not even funny. It's sad. THis is a stupid stupid horrible
awful
piece of garbage that should be burned. THe  sequels should be burned too.
