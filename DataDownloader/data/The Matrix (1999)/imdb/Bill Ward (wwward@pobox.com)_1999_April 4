1999_April 4 

This is the sort of flick I would produce if I produced flicks.  Keanu,
building on his cyberpunk image from &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; brought in his usual
mix of the styled computer geek with a dash of Japanese-anime style drama
which may very well become the hallmark of this genre to
come.
Perhaps what I like best about these &quot;types&quot; of movies is the constant
dichotomy of gritty, run down holes where the heroes play and the sterile,
fortress-like office environments (not wholly unlike the hole I find myself
in from 9-5.) where the enemy lay.
Finally, this movie may mean the most to you if you've ever buried your head
in a Gibson novel or spent hours of your life digging around the
underpinnings of our beloved Internet.  These movies forspeak a day when the
gearheads of the net become warriors of corporate interest (or worse,) or
rats, scurrying about the sewers under the streets, subverting the
establishment in pursuit of some crusade.<br /><br />Hey, I liked it, and Ms. Moss' wardrobe crew deserves props for the
ultra-spiff outfits.
-Bill.  See you on the net. :)
