1999_May 16 

This is fun entertainment.  I enjoyed watching the movie, not only for the
F/X, but I wanted to know how the ending was going to turn out. The Matrix
did its best to keep you in suspense, and it worked....but, I do believe
that it could have done without the romance part.  Some of the other
comments have stated that they felt this movie left things
unexplained....I
for one didn't find anything that needed to be explained, I think the
movie
did a pretty good job in explaining something that is kind of tricky to
explain.<br /><br />The Matrix cleverly borrowed from other movies of this genre, i.e., Dark
City and Total Recall, and it packaged it quite nicely with astounding
special effects....to tell you the truth, I think The Gap commericals were
instrumental in the freeze-frame-camera-motion effects.  But,
nevertheless,
I would watch this movie twice..and to be honest with you, I think the
writers made this movie a bit confusing so that people will see it twice,
thereby increaseing the net profits of this movie....pretty
clever!<br /><br />One last note, If you enjoyed this movie, I suggest you rent Dark
City.
