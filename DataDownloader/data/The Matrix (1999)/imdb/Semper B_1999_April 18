1999_April 18 

Of course I had to *see* _The Matrix_ (since I couldn't be told what it
is?), but I'm wondering if I would have had a different perspective on the
movie had I *not* seen/read so much &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; info on it.  From
the behind-the-scenes stuff (especially the HBO &quot;First Look&quot;), I knew that
it was a couple of guys trying to do in &quot;real life&quot; what the Japanese do
with animation - and in that, they succeeded...but that's not, as it turns
out, a good thing.  Japanimation (anime) always has fantastic visuals,
cool
characters, brilliant action sequences, and a lot of fun high-tech
gadgetry...but is usually weak on a coherent plot and any sort of help for
a
plot-confused audience that is blinded by all the flashy effects.  _The
Matrix_ managed to get (unfortunately) *all* of those elements into a
live-action film.  While the plot coherency was certainly a notch above
films such as _Mission: Impossible_, it clearly took second priority to
the
brothers Wachowski - they just wanted to create the amazing look of
Japanimation in live-action.  Sure, they succeeded...but I was sorely
disappointed in the movie, and wondered if - had I not seen the
behind-the-scenes - I would have realized *why* it was so convoluted and
left me feeling as hungry as a huge Chinese meal two hours later.  _The
Matrix_ would've been much better if it *had* been a cartoon, but
understandably wouldn't have received as much public attention (since most
of the viewing public has yet to show any respect to even *good*
animation).
