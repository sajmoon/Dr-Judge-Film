1999_June 18 

I went to see this movie twice, and maybe I'll go another
time.
It's a totally cool idea of this world being a fake, virtual world that is
fed into the minds of us, humans, to let us think everything is OK, which
is
not the case. We've let things get out of control when we invented AI and
now &quot;the robots&quot; use our bodies for their energy supply. Neo (Keanu
Reeves)
is pulled out of The Matrix to the real world (or what's left of it) to
save
mankind. I especially totally liked the 'agents'. The way they behave,
act,
move, speak is so very credible, machine-like. They look like men in black
but they're cooler in some sort of way.
They never react wildly, but speak distinctly. Bad guys of this millennium
if you're askin' me!
The fighting scenes are also very mind-blowing. The slowmotion/fast blurry
effects are like you're watching them in trance (definitely go see this
movie in a big-screen cinema!!!).
The bullet dodging and flying around is very believable.
also check out the soundtrack! it really rocks!!!
