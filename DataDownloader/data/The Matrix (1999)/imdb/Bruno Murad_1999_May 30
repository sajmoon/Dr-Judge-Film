I see no use in describing the story of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, so let's jump
straight to the point.
I didn't expect &quot;The Matrix&quot; to be that good. I just walked in to find
a very thrilling movie, full of action and amazing visual effects.<br /><br />The actors are doing pretty well too, and Hugo Weaving is the ultimate
perfect villain... I haven't seen such evil character since Darth Vader
and,
more recently, The Fratelli Family (&quot;The Goonies&quot;).
There are also good and sharp quotations from The Bible, showing Neo as
the savior and Morfeus as John Baptiste, the annunciator. It's also a
point
showed in &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot;, where Renfield shouts the arrival of
his
master, the AntiChrist.
So, if I were you, I would follow the White Rabbit to the closest movie
room and watch &quot;The Matrix&quot;. You won't be disappointed.
