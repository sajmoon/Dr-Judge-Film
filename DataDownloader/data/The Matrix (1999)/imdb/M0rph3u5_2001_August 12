When I first saw the preview for this trailer I was a bit confused.
However,
on March 31st, the opening day, my eyes stayed opened and my popcorn and
pepsi remained untouched. The Matrix is surely one of the best movies that
I
have ever seen, and I have seen quite a bit of movies. The special effects
are simply out of this world, and the fight scenes are definitely awesome.
Not only are these things spectacularly done, but the lobby shootout scene
certainly makes this movie a must-see for everyone.
