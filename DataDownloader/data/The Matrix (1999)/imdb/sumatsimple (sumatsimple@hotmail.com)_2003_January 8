2003_January 8 

Im sure this film is the sci-fi film on the 90s, and why shouldn't it be.
I
really wanted to hate this, it was being so over-
hyped at the time, i saw it in its last week of play at the cinema; and i
was wrong to do so! A quality film!!<br /><br />The premise of this film is one which will have you really thinking as it
ends; it's kind of life-affirming; shouldn't we be living life, and
enjoying
it, rather than struggling with our pretentious realities?<br /><br />The Matrix is action-orientated. It's been cited, and apparently spun-off
by
so many films now, that we should really aknowledge its major impact
within
the modern cinema world. It is not a trash film though; I know, i've seen
many.<br /><br />Action sequences are somewhat remeniscant to Blade, but are seemingly
less
gratuitous, and infrequent; they are necessary in man's fight against
&quot;the
machine&quot;.<br /><br />Once again, i have to comment over certain visual aspects of the film.
It's
very 'cinema du look', very stylish. Dark and gothic perhaps, with a soft
green tinge (very apparent in the strip-light 'office'
world).<br /><br />Neo (One), a great role for Keanu Reeves, not a fan personally, but he's
made himself with this great role. Other characters are strong, but
lacking
development; it's a flaw wholly un-noticed.<br /><br />Go out and see this film. It's clever and stylish and based around a
great
fantasy premise, perhaps even on a religious scale (it's not lacking in
religious iconography). Be amused by the one-liners, and western-esque
fight
scenes, and get absorbed in the fantasy! This is one best with the lights
off, curtains shut and sound whacked up. Don't mind the neighbours,
infact,
invite them over!
