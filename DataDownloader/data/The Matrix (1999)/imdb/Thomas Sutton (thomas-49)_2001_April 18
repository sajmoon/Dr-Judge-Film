Guns, blood and language. It must have took the wachowski brothers ages to
think of their film storyline. Maybe it is true, maybe our minds are trapped
in a prison but if we are, god help Keanu Reeves! He plays Neo who is
supposedly the ONE to take down the people who trapped humans mind in a
prison, the agents. Great film, 9.5/10.
