All right, I know the majority of you out there love this film but why? Oh
great a CGI master piece with an oh so boring story characters I wanted to
see die including the &quot;good guys&quot; Lame action scenes as all it was was
slow
motion and pansy ass stunts, crap use of a minigun (see predator for a
good
minigun) Crap soundtrack, oh and it was waaaay too long for what it was.
The
way the future was presented was dull, and uninvolving. The major gripe
that
i have is the choice of pill what if Neo had chosen the other pill? I'll
tell you what it might have made the film better. How dare it claims to be
an action film, losely tagged on with Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk. Bin this waste of
time effort film and money and get BLADE RUNNER, a true masterpiece that
is
involving interesting has character development an amazing view of the
future, a profound question that an attempt to answer is made to. Not to
mention characters that are not clear cut good or evil and that you can
care
about. (Fair enough Neo is presented as a hacker, ohhh scary and so
naughty)
3/10 Purely for the presence of Lauwrence Fishbourne.
