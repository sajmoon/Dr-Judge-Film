1999_April 6 

I walked into this movie with one thing on my
mind - &quot;The special effects will be awesome, the movie will
suck.&quot; Boy, was I wrong. I had what a lot of people had -
&quot;Johhny Mnemonic&quot; flashbacks prior to walking in. I mean, let's
face it - he's never done Sci-Fi well.<br /><br />Anyways, enough of expectations. From the moment Carrie-Ann Moss
floated into the air and did her little Kung Fu maneuvers, I
knew the special effects were going to be killer and I was
hooked if for no other reason just to see more of that.<br /><br />What I got was not only a special effects ride, but an engaging
plot. Laurence Fishburne and his Obi-Wan like character fit him
more nicely than I had thought it would. He was quite convincing
as the man who has been &quot;searching for the one&quot;. Keanu Reeves is
not a fantastic actor, but he held his own here. He actually had
me convinced that he was the &quot;one&quot;.<br /><br />The plot was incredibly intelligent even if it isn't new - it's
the question philosophers have been battling for years - &quot;What
is reality?&quot; The Wachowski brothers handled this question with
incredible skill, however. They took a tired idea and repackaged
it for today's vision of tomorrow's technology - the ultimate VR
experience.
