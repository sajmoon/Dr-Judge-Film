I'll ditto most of the accolades given this movie by my fellow viewers,
and
add highest praise for Hugo Weaving's rendition of the incredible Agent
Smith -- what a consummate creep, and funny as hell -- the forehead, the
deadpan barely-hiding-disgust delivery of his lines -- my pick for Best
Supporting Actor.<br /><br />One minor nit to pick -- am I the only one bothered when an entire movie
depends on everyone's inability to shoot straight?!?
