Right there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me.  I love this film,
and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time
(i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out
(although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking
material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't
usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. 
Enjoy!
