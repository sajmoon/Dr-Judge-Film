'The Matrix' would have to be one of the best actions movies I have seen
this year.<br /><br />It gathers in the twists of a thriller, the effects of a sci-fi and the
adrenaline rush of an action movie.<br /><br />Unlike most movies, 'The Matrix' is one of the few that gets better the
second time you see it.  Once you have the story line in your head you can
enjoy the effects instead of trying to keep up with both.  However, in
saying that, the plot isn't that hard to grasp but it does dart off in
different directions.<br /><br />If you want something that is entertaining, keeps you on the edge of your
seat, definitely watch this movie!
