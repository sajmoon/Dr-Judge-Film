I've seen it five times at the cinema, three times on video and twice on
DVD. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is probably one of the best science fiction action
movies
to date. Borrowing fight/action choreography from Hong Kong cinema and
drawing on camera work similar to that seen in &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; fuses
them together with awe inspiring special effects. Keanu's acting short
falls
are well hidden and the pot is well thought out.<br /><br />Most people will love this film, and rightly so, but if you are under the
impression that these fight scenes are the pinnacle of cinematic
achievement
then I am afraid they still pale in comparison to Hong Kong offerings. If
you do subscribe to this opinion then I would strongly advise you towards
renting &quot;Drive directors cut&quot; from your local video store. You won't be
sorry.
