Don't try to fool me that I didn't understand it, cause I
did.<br /><br />And I must say, even though I wasn't at all confused by the script and
plot
as so many others seem to be, I don't think its a bad movie. But h**l, its
not THAT good!<br /><br />I mean come on! I used to had no problems with this movie the first time I
saw it, but I have learned to hate it, since its so EXTREMELY overrated
(just having it 29 on the best movies ever is a proof).<br /><br />THE MATRIX is although trying really hard, but I can't even seem to be
impressed by one single actionscene. In my opinion. Go see FACE/OFF or
some
other John Woo-movie to be stunned by action (it won't happen a lot). And
it
starts up with being (er, sorry trying to be) a smart sci-fi-movie, but
suddenly Morpheus gets kidnapped by a team of wooden-acting-agents and it
ends up like ANY OTHER bye-bye-brain actionmovie! Am I wrong? Climbing on
walls, bounching off bullets, oohh... Give me a break! To be clear, I'd
say
like this: ''After 25 minutes we know what the matrix is, the rest of the
movie is a long hyped up, action-standard, with a lot of glamour. Ehh...
intelligent? NOT!<br /><br />I'm still confused how this movie got to be such a hit (yeah, go ahead
mindless matrix-fans, laugh it all off), because the entire movie is old
stuff, in a new package. The acting, with the exception of Laurence
Fishbourne and perhaps little Joe too, is awful. Keanu seems tired and his
entire face shines with that ''I should have listened to my mommy, and
become a lawyer''-face. The rest of the cast is on the edge of average,
many
below.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, lets not forget all the martial arts. Eehh... is it only me, or
are the guys who thought they were spectacular just unwilling to watch
some
old good Bruce Lee-films.<br /><br />Also, I would like to point out that this movie was NOT ORIGINAL! The main
plot has been used many times before. If anyone can find something out of
the ordernal, please give me a mail. Didn't think so.<br /><br />And has anyone of these matrix-lovers ever seen 2001? THAT'S an sci-fi
movie! With effects that lives on still today! Why don't you guys check
out
THE MATRIX after about 33 years, it will probably be so boring that it
won't
be watchable, and people will wonder: How the h**l did this win 4 academy
awards?<br /><br />Just thinking about Matrix 2, and 3 makes my blood chill. I guess my
mailbox
will be filled with criticism, after this, but I know how to respond,
trust
me...<br /><br />But, it still is an entertaining and fun movie, that I will never watch
again in my life! My rating is 6/10 but I still hate it.
