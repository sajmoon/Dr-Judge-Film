1999_October 2 

I honestly do not know where to begin. I found &quot;The Matrix&quot; to be
simultaneously mind-altering, exhilarating, gasp-inducing, nauseating and
maddening. Yet I believe that the true power of the film lies in its ability
to make the viewer truly believe in the power of the Matrix. As I watched
the film, I lost myself in the world of the 21st century. Yet the most
chilling part of the film was the concept that machines could overrun the
world. The concept of artificial intelligence with emotions and needs was
addressed well in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; but this film goes far beyond
HAL. The idea of artificial intelligence considering us to be zoo animals,
and accusing us of exhausting supplies-since when is artificial intelligence
a natural commodity? Since when do computers deserve the earth more than
humans? And since when did people lose all worth? I truly wanted to attack
Agent Smith as he hurled these depraved comments at Morpheus.<br /><br />On a lighter note, I loved all of the little allusions in the film.
Obviously, &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot; came from &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; and
Morpheus' comment about tumbling down the hole followed in the same vein.
There was also a great deal of Biblical imagery. Neo was like a present day
Jesus. There were also numerous references to religion, including Trinity's
name, Adam Road, and the idea that he was THE ONE to save humanity. You
could also consider Cypher a type of Judas, who would betray his friends for
riches. Yet I also saw a bit of the X-Files in this film, with the theme of
conspiracy; Star Wars, with Morpheus as a sort of Jedi master (&quot;Don't think
about it, do it.&quot;) and Neo as a sort of Luke Skywalker. Even Morpheus'
comment had a Yoda-like feel about it. <br /><br />I think that the film took great pains to demonstrate the values of
humanity, and the price they put on life. The artificial intelligence was a
sharp contrast. Although Smith confides that he too wants to be free, he
hates humanity. Neo and friends aim to preserve life. We hold a higher value
on life than battery fluid. The idea of infants ingesting the fluid of the
deceased also made me nauseous. Soylent green as a liquid. Fun. Yet despite
all of the nauseating blood, vomit and liquid people, I was simply blown
away by this film. It challenged my entire viewpoint on life, challenging me
to consider the idea that life is but a dream......It was a fine effort, and
I hope that the 2 window-washing brothers come up with another provocative
film.
