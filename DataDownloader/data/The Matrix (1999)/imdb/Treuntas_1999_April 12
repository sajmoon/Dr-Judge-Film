The Matrix is one of those rare movies, that is very distinct and
incredible. After seeing this movie a person's perspective of the world can
be placed on a shakey foundation.<br /><br />The action is phenomonal. The fight scenes are fast, furious and amazing.
The special effects are spectacular and actually seem like they belong in
the movie.<br /><br />This movie is best described as a science fiction flick with some cool
action scenes (especially the main gunfight!).<br /><br />You have to see this movie, that is all there is to it. <br /><br />
