THE MATRIX (1999) ****  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne,
Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano.  Waycoo
state-of-the-art visual effects and some kickass blending of
cyberpunk sci-fi, action, film noir, religious oracle imagery and oh
yeah a mind-bending story line of Neo, The Chosen One for the
21st Century in the form of lovable lunkhead Reeves (`.whoa!')
who finds himself in a nightmare of virtual reality being controlled
by an alien race hellbent on total domination and destruction of
mankind.  Some excellently edited and choreographed sequences
by wunderkinds, flavors-of-the-decade directing brothers
Wachowski, Andy &amp; Larry, whose graphic novel (read: comic book)
depiction a la `Blade Runner', `Dark City' and any other sci-fi fable
of humanity questioning What's It All About navel gazing gives off a
giddy, guilty rush of adrenaline and one head rush of  a movie
viewing experience.  Kudos to production designer Owen
Paterson's sleek, sexy visionary and cinematographer's nifty, tricky
photography.
