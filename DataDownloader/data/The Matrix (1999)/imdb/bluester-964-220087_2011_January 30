Humans... are... really computer programs That are existing inside the
Quantum Physics of worlds created by their own mind and behavior
&#x22;Karma&#x22; is just the old way of describing todays Quantum Physics How
you behave is the world you live in .....and get three chances to
escape to a better existence.. by reacting differently to your life&#x27;s
problems...EVOLVE.. Free Your Mind ! ....Just as Morpheus says, much
more than a sci-fi flick a quick peek at the paradigm shift that is
starting to make its&#x27; presents felt, A bit shocking at first review,
but rich in valuable symbolism for the logic centers in your
walnut..Think Bio computers,DNA and Gene mapping and the 72 names of
God for you Kabbalah fans Each letter in the Torah is used to make 3
letter words that represent Gods names Each is a description of a DNA
code sequence that is used to map out life Just Thinking Can you
imagine if God is really a ancient computer and all the experiences we
have help give him that ever present eveywhere existence
