Never have I seen such a visually astounding movie.  The Wachowski brothers
have found the perfect balance of special effects, action, and plot.  Each
cast member brought a unique personality to the movie and cannot be replaced
by anyone.  Keanu Reeves brings his dark sexy intelligent look, Carrie-Anne
Moss shows us that a woman can definitely kick some butt and still be
feminine, and Laurence Fishburne brings god-like wisdom.  If you have not
seen this movie, I suggest you leave NOW, and The Matrix will have you too.
Can't wait for the sequels.
