The Matrix is a feast for the eyes, and don't blink!  It is exciting, scary,
funny, and I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Neo than Keanu Reeves.
The action sequences have to be seen to be believed, and the knowledge that
Keanu, Laurence, Carrie and Hugo were actually doing most of their fight
scenes themselves made my jaw drop.<br /><br />This goes on my list of favorite science fiction films of all time, up there
with Bladerunner and Star Wars.
