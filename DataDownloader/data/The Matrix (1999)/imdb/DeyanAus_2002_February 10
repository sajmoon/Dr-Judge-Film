Sometimes it seems that certain people have forgotten how to enjoy
themselves. They have a keen eye to spot each and every imperfect detail,
yet they miss on the big picture, which is, to enjoy oneself and have fun.
Surely even the critics have found the movie exciting and at moments
exhilarating. Watch it in theatre or home on a big wide screen TV with the
sound volume turned up. You'll have a lot of fun! A couple of awkward
moments, like that clumsy elevator dialogue between Neo and Morpheus early
in the movie, will just represent a nice opportunity for you to relax a bit.
I've had a lot of fun watching this movie, and for its thrilling cyber-ride
I'm giving it 9/10.
