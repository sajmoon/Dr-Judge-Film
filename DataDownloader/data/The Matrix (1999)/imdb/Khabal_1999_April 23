1999_April 23 

If you've seen the commercial for 'The Matrix', then you've basically seen
it all.  95% of the action in this film can be seen in the trailer.  
The feeble attempt to cover an extremely thin plot by dazzling the audience
with special effects ALMOST works; there just wasn't enough surprise since
they gave it all away in the commercials.
If you're looking for well-rounded characters, you will be disappointed.
They are as flat as the plot.
Fishburne does a great job in his role, but the long-winded speeches and
monotone expression will put you to sleep.
The last 25 minutes or so gave 'The Matrix' a breath of fresh air; wonderful
action. If you fell asleep from the first 90 minutes, you will be awake
then.  Many people saw that last 25 minutes and thought the film was great
because of just that. I, however, believe it takes much more than a few
special effects to earn my $6.50.
At least at the show I saw, I was one of the majority; it seemed like more
people disliked it than enjoyed it.
If you have $6.50 and 2 hrs to spare, and if the Cable is out, go see 'The
Matrix' ... otherwise, wait for the video.
