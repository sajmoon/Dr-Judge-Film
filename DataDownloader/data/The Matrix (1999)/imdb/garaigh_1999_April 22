1999_April 22 

I saw this movie last weekend and it really blew me away. The plot is (I
thought) very original and puts several news twists on the standard
artificial intelligence deal. Even more amazing than the plot though was the
way the movie was actually carried out. The special effects were great but
it wasn't just the special effects that made the feel of the movie. The
whole cinematography was really good. I highly recommend this movie and I'm
planning on going back to see it several more times.
