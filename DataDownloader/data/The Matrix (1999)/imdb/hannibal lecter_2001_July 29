What is The Matrix?
After you see a movie like the matrix you have to ask yourself is it
really
the truth, do we really live inside the matrix or in some kind of a
matrix.<br /><br />I can't answer this question, but if you focus on the little things in the
movie you'll find out how much it really is similar to our
world
and to our purpose in the world.<br /><br />If you seek entertainment, kung-fu fighting and unbelieveable special
effects you'll like this movie, but remmember that this isn't the most
important part of the movie.<br /><br />
