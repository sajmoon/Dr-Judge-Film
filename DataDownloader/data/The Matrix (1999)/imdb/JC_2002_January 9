Drawback #1     K.R. I'm sure he is a nice guy, but almost every performance
I've seen of his... I don't quite know how to describe it without sounding
cruel. The words monotone and deadpan come to mind. Just about every movie
I've seen this guy in comes across that way, with the exception of Bill and
Ted's... but I think that was a good example of excellent type casting. 
K.R. continues to land leading man roles and I hope that something happens
to free up the multitude of his unused, lazy, facial muscles and maybe some
vocal training could help to vary some tone. Respectively, they sure come in
handy during close ups and it might make the sound guy work a little harder.
     <br /><br />Drawback #2     The martial arts scenes...(if you could call it that) Let's
just say karate...  What cool special effects... to me a poor substitute for
sloppy martial arts... nothing I hate more than watching slow martial
artists(karate trainees) being made to look good. But not everyone can be a
Jackie Chan. Anyone who really knows what martial arts is about... knows it
takes many years to really get that good and to be really effective. <br /><br />Other than those two drawbacks I thought this film was very entertaining.  I
give it an 8... and a 0 Poke*. <br /><br />*Poke score = the number of times my wife had to jab me in the ribs to wake
me up to continue watching a film.<br /><br />
