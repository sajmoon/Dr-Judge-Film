I'm going to say this and get it over with. It should not be Rated R. It
should be PG-13. Theres no strong language its just violent. Now, the
review: This is one of the best shoot 'em up movies ever. The way they use
bullet time and the fighting. I've seen many movies like this and none can
beat them. In fact, some kids on my block play it! It must be a good movie
then. Now, I like it, but I wouldn't go as far as playing. It gets slow as
some points, only leading up to the greatest shooting scenes in history. The
Matrix is a movie to rent or even buy! Get ready for a great
movie.
