1999_September 27 

Considering all the impressive (or at least interesting) Sci-Fi movies of
the past few years (e.g., &quot;Contact!&quot;, &quot;Cube&quot;, &quot;Dark City&quot;, &quot;Pi&quot;,&quot;Gattaca&quot;,
etc.), the attention being paid to &quot;The Matrix&quot; completely baffles me.  It
seems to be an unconvincing amalgam of a bad Kung-Fu movie (yeah, I DO know
that's redundant) with a confused and overly-pretentious
Sci-Fi
&quot;vision.&quot;   Unfortunately, it really doesn't work on either level.  I kept
watching in morbid fascination, waiting for something unexpected (or at
least INTERESTING ;)) to happen, but it never did.  **1/2 out of **** for
the FX.
