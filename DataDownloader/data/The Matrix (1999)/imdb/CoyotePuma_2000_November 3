THE MATRIX is a great special-effects movie, setting a higher standard for
future releases.  It was for this reason alone I purchased its DVD.
Casting, on the other hand, I found to be weak, its leading roles unable
to
draw on the significant elements of the story.  In this, I failed to sense
the peril of a society held hostage in a virtual reality.  Keanu Reeves,
as
Neo, adds to my disbelief by neither portraying a knowledgeable computer
hacker or a savior of humanity.  Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, faired
little better as a mentor or a zealot..  If there was an emotional
highlight
in the film's presentation, it must have been the acting of Carrie-Anne
Moss.  Her characterization of Trinity showed the loyalty to their cause
and
the sense of underlying fear needed to make her rebel character
believable.<br /><br />Whatever the problems I found with THE MATRIX, watching a new generation
of
special-effects debut was pure enjoyment.  Future productions will have to
reach even higher into our imagination than ever before to match THE
MATRIX.
Simple copying of its techniques will never produce that sense of wonder
found in their first-viewing.
