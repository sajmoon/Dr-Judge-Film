This is a movie that people either adore or disregard totally... but I
haven't found (though it is statisticley possible) someone who actually
hates The Matrix. This, in itself, humours me since this movie IS about
hating the matrix and alot of people around me agreed that if it was up
to
them, they'd probably take the blue pill. WIERD, MAN!<br /><br />I, of course, think completely otherwise.<br /><br />Yet, this movie, like many others, has what seems to be an
anti-technocracy
attitude. I disagree with that observation too, because this film is all
about how bad choices can make things go wrong, and how good ones can
make
them better. Not because technology is bad, but because those who weild
it
has &quot;the smell&quot;, and I too feel, sometimes, &quot;saturated&quot; by it. it is
obnoxious and it is our greatest and foremost weakness as a specie. Yet
the
movies shows that there is a diffrence between knowing the path and
walking
on it.<br /><br />As a determinist, I do not belive in free choice. I do agree that the
illusion is mighty, and the movie depicts exactly that. What is
important,
after all, is to feel good about yourself and accept your fate. Don't
mind
the reality - stick to what you are and embrace what you consider is good
and true in yourself and then, things would SEEM righter.<br /><br />So THAT, in my part, is the greatness of this movie over thousnds of
others.
It holds such beautiful concepts, ideas and thought, in what seems to be
a
high-tech-action-stunts-cash-monger, and a good one too.<br /><br />and yet It's not. It is most certainley not. There is a
spoon!<br /><br />end messege.<br /><br />N.
