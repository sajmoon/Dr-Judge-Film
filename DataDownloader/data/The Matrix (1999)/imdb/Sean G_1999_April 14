1999_April 14 

I went to see this movie last week, but I just can't get it out of my
mind.
It was absolutely brilliant; one of the most original and well put
together
films ever made. But the bit I liked best about it was that it keeps you
thinking well after you see the movie. I couldn't give it anything less
than
a 10 and a high recommendation.
