If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then a lot of people must
really like this movie. The amount of times I have seen what is now called
Matrix-style action in other movies and shows is quite
something.<br /><br />Some people might dislike the fact that other people seem to be copying it
left and right. I don't mind. I loved the Matrix; why wouldn't I want to see
more?<br /><br />Great acting (even by Keanu! weird) and a fine overall movie. If you haven't
seen it yet, shame on you. 9.5/10 on My Personal Scale.
