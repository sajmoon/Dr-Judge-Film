The arguments for and against this film are many. Most people say it
glamorizes violence, and while I certainly don't dispute that, I can say
that this isn't the most violent film out there, or even the most violent
one that I've seen. <br /><br />Personally, I loved the film. I could go on and on about what I like but I'm
sure a hundred other comments have already covered it. So I'm just going to
urge you to see it, if you haven't already. <br /><br />Go see it. My Personal Rating: 9/10
