I guess everyone has once seen a church service young American
denominations-style. It&#x27;s like female choir is singing, someone&#x27;s
playing synth or guitar, and a priest in front of them shouts &#x22;God is
love&#x22;, and &#x22;Jesus loves you.&#x22; The lambs shout back these things and all
other stuff which is familiar to everyone who has heard something of
Christianity.<br /><br />&#x22;The Matrix&#x22; has very much in common with such ceremonies. An action
movie with an original aesthetics and slow motion can be interesting to
watch, just like listening to gospels is sometimes an unalloyed
pleasure. But the problem about &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is its annoying sermon.
With an incredible solemnity and wannabe-prophetical intonation we&#x27;re
fed with an alloy of the most common places philosophy knows. The
famous &#x22;There is no spoon&#x22; phrase - Neo&#x27;s pupils widen, now he
understands everything. A stupid watcher is supposed here to make two
or three thinking operations and feel satisfacted for being smart. The
intention is simple - or I give too much credit for Wachowskis, maybe
this half- philosophy is really the ultimate one for them.<br /><br />It&#x27;s possible to associate solipsism and platonism with a modern
virtual reality concept cleverly and softly. Wachowskis, however, do it
boldly and pushily. Even the spoon quote is not enough, they also use
messiah figure, i.e. Neo himself. Now it&#x27;s a serious business. Neo&#x27;s
gonna show people what they don&#x27;t wanna see (quote-unquote). The film
starts to fail in amusement at once because Neo hogs the story&#x27;s
blanket; however, film&#x27;s grandiloquence increases to an unbelievable
level.<br /><br />Thus, &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is an example of movie which is trying to seem what
it&#x27;s not. Wachowskis try to insert their simple story of people in
stylish black coats into as many classical contexts as possible: here
we have Nebuchdenazzar, and messiah, and also Morpheus, - whilst the
ideological concept is more like of a high school student&#x27;s essay on a
subject of philosophy, compiled in one night before deadline. That&#x27;s
what is the word &#x22;tedious&#x22; exists.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it occurred to be the rightest thing. (By the way,
effectiveness of such model is well-known: in literature it&#x27;s exploited
by Richard Bach and Paolo Coelho, to name a few.) More than ten years
have passed, and still millions of Wachowskis&#x27; lambs singing and
dancing, and repeating whatever the siblings say. &#x22;There is no spoon,&#x22;
chant Wachowskis. &#x22;There is no spoon,&#x22; echoes the congregation
deliriously.
