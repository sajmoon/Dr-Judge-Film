1999_December 3 

Although the Matrix is an entertaining movie there was something missing
from the film that i could not quite put my finger on. Perhaps the Storyline
was a little too confusing or perhaps i was expecting Better special effects
, i don't know.
The Matrix all in all is a good film without living up to some of the hype
the papers indulged in. The Acting is good but not Brilliant while the
storyline showed so much promise but it did not deliver. I still can't
understand where the ship was that they were living in.Perhaps we wasn't
supposed to know.
7 out of 10.
