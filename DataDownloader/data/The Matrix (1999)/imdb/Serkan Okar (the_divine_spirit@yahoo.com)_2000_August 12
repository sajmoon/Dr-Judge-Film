There are so many reasons why I think &quot;The Matrix&quot; is the most brilliant
science fiction movie ever made but I like to present its philosophical
implications because that's what interested me most. Now, most people may
think that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is just a great science fiction movie with lots of
amazing special effects but there is more to it than that. As a person with
special interest in philosophy, I was amazed by the plot. It's like Plato's
theory of forms converted into a science fiction plot! Plato is one of the
greatest philosophers of all time from ancient Greece who theorized that the
world we live in is not real. Instead, it is a reflection of a real world
and all the objects we see are mere shadows of the ideal forms which exit in
that real world. I do not want to go into much detail for I think the
implication is obvious: The world we live in is &quot;The Matrix&quot; where nothing
is real; it is a computer-generated reality in which human minds are trapped
while our real brains are hooked up to a giant computer administering that
program to consume our energy. So everything we see is just a reflection of
the objects created in that program, electronic signals stimulating our
nerves to give us the impression that we are actually sensing material
objects. In fact we are just watching the shield put in front of our eyes to
prevent us from seeing the truth (just like in Plato's cave). Now this plot
is amazingly parallel with the most recent findings in physics; Bertrand
Russell explained it in a completely scientific way that we can never know
if the real world exists because all we sense is just electronic signals
stimulating our senses; we cannot know where these electronic signals are
coming from or if the source of these signals is a &quot;material substance&quot; in
the sense we think of the term. &quot;The Matrix&quot; suggests that these signals are
delivered to us by a computer. There have been many empiricist philosophers,
like George Berkeley and David Hume who denied the existence of the material
world but their methods of proving their theories were not as scientific as
the ones developed in the mid 1900s. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a movie where
implications in these philosophical theories are presented in science
fiction which, I think, makes &quot;The Matrix&quot; so special. I sometimes think
that this world is not real and our real existence lies in another
dimension. I have friends who have the exact same feeling. Those of you who
have similar thoughts will find the science fictional interpretation of
their thoughts in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. <br /><br />The fact that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a computer-generated reality makes all the
visual effects, specially the fighting scenes, very plausible. Luckily, this
fact makes it possible to create any kind of visual effects without the risk
of making it look unrealistic (this is a computer program, anything can be
real).
&quot;The Matrix&quot; is definitely one of its kind; it is not like most other
science fiction movies where humans are against aliens. The screenplay is so
original that it makes it surpass all other science fiction movies except,
maybe my other science fiction favourite, &quot;The Planet Of The Apes&quot;. I cannot
imagine a science fiction fan not liking this movie.
