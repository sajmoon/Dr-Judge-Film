'The Matrix' and how much you will like it depends on the tastes of, you,
the viewer. Younger audiences, preferably teenagers, will probably watch it
for the cool special effects (people jumping high into the air and at long
distances, slow motion movement, people walking on walls) and fast, well
choreographed fight sequences, involving intense hand-to-hand and weapons
combat with plenty of action.<br /><br />But, aside from this, the older, adult audience will probably watch it for
the story-line...that is extremely well written but a tad difficult to
understand, because the movie moves at a pretty fast pace. So 'The Matrix'
is the type of movie where if you miss a single section, you could miss the
entire movie. The younger, teenage audience will probably over look
this.<br /><br />So 'The Matrix' really appeals to audiences of all ages, I give it a 10
out
of a possible 10. The Walchowski brothers did their homework on this
one.<br /><br />Note: Some of the movie's scenes may be somewhat unsettling to younger,
less mature viewers. One scene shows large robotic creatures harvesting
humans and babies like plants, and another shows Neo, the main character,
having his mouth closed by his skin, tied down, and having a large bug eat
into his stomach. Note this first, but it depends upon the viewer's
maturity
level.
