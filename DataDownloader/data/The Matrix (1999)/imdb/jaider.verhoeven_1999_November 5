1999_November 5 

When I visited this site the first time I read some comments about 'the
Matrix'. I was shocked. People that claim to have some movie-knowledge
portrayed 'the Matrix' as an immature martial arts movie without any depth
or philosophy. I am not claiming that I have a lot of movie-knowledge, but
the concept, the styling, the special effects, everything. I have never
seen
a movie like this. I can say that a baby is born. This movie could change
the way of making movies for the future. So...Andy...Larry...thank you for
that.
