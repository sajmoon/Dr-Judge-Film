Along with such recent films as Trainspotting and Run, Lola, Run, The
Matrix
represents a new benchmark in the evolution of the cinema.  Sure, the
storyline is nothing new to science fiction and comic book fans (I happen
to
remember an early issue of Fantastic Four that dealt with the same subject
matter), but the style and even the substance of this little masterpiece
from the Brothers Wachowski will give even the most critical mind something
to chew on during repeated viewings.  Not for everyone 6
Highly recommended.
