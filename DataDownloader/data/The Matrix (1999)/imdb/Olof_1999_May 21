1999_May 21 

i must say, my hopes weren't too high about this movie, and, well... i
totally loved every second of it, until the ending,
which i must say, was _totally_ disappointing, the worst
ending
i've ever seen probably, but don't let this scare you, it's definitely a
movie worth to go see, but don't expect to leave the theater with a smile,
i
didn't.
