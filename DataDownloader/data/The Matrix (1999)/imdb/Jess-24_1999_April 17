1999_April 17 

This movie has risen to fame faster than any other in resent history. And
with good reason. It has once again raised the bar for sci-fi and special
effects. The plot is somewhat old-hat, for if you've seen alot of sci-fi
movies, the idea of parallel universes ain't all that different. But you
must look past that.
1) the acting and dialouge are great. The actor who played Smith
was excellent.
2) the special effects
3) the set directions and the costumes are great. The settings all very
spooky.
3 good reasons beyond a good plot to appreciate the Matrix. It's
20 on the IMDB's 250 list and I hope it stays there. This has to be one of
the greatest sci-fi movies ever. It should be compared
to films like '2001' 'Star Wars' and '12 monkeys'. It will undoubtebly
bring
the directors to international fame. Did I mention you should go see it?
