1999_July 10 

this film is magnificent. it makes you drop your jaw, it makes you cringe,
and it makes think. the special effects in this movie are extraordinary.
on
the downside, it does lose some of its audience due to complication. but
if
you have any brain power, and enjoy using it, then i definitely recommend
you see it. you'll be disturbed, amazed, and quite possibly, paranoid as a
result. either way, this is truly a wonderful thrill-ride of a movie worth
giving a look. i give it a 9.
