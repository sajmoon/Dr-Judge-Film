1999_October 13 

I had rented at video store this movie without further expectations.
Result
: What a blast of energy with a superb action-FX combination and a story
with doomsday atmosphere.  Especially on home theater system.  I have seen
3
times this movie on VHS and project to see it on DVD.  For me there is no
doubt that is the best SCI-FI thriller i have seen with stars wars, allien
and terminator, but again matrix has really the best action scenes (people
moving like iron monkeys and soundtrack really cool).<br /><br />Don't forget the matrix 2 and 3 will be released
