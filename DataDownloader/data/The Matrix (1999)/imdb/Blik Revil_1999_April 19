Wow!<br /><br />I got the chance to see the Matrix in original language way before german
release date. What I saw was both intense and unique - never-seen-before
special effects combined with a really good story.<br /><br />I only noticed one negative thing - the trailer has an even better design
(cut, music).<br /><br />Unfortunately no-one can be told what the Matrix is - you have to see it for
yourself...<br /><br />Have fun!
