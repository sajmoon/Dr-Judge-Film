The Matrix is an amazing film.  Everything about it is so high-class and
polished.  The Matrix is a scifi/action movie, and the story focuses on
telling us what the Matrix is.  I won`t spoil this massive movie for the
poor souls, who haven`t seen it yet.  The actionscenes are amazing, it takes
the classic style of John Woo, and adds the sci-fi element: the characters
are now able to run up against a wall while they are shooting.
&quot;Unfortunately nobody can be told what the Matrix is, you`ll have to see it
for yourself&quot;.
9/10
