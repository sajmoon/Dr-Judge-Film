THE MATRIX
My E-mail: fredro_link_86@hotmail.com<br /><br />Thank you, everybody who has written in and unliked this movie. I'm sure you
can all agree to me, that it is only action-freaked kids who can find this
sort of thing the best movie ever. Show them ''Casablanca'' and they'll
spew. Show them ''The Matrix'' without special effects and I guarantee that
the result will make them highly bored. 'Cause without it. What is
it?
NOTHING! Matrix-fanatics knows NOTHING about the art of movie-making!<br /><br />Once again, thanks people for showing what an incredibly over rated movie
this really is. I guess we can still try to keep our love for real cinema
art and movie making alive.<br /><br />
