Wow this film blew me away when I first saw it back in 1999, the sound
track
is fantastic &amp; yes I have watched the film lots &amp; lots (though no-one's
bought me it on video).
Anyway back to the most fantastic film I have seen, ever. I just could not
get my head back to reality it was, as best described, as a &quot;What if that
is
the truth?&quot; I mean this film tests your brain. You enjoy it &amp; it gives you
that buzzing sensation of &quot;What if...&quot; (either that or the sound at the
cinema was way too loud!).
I don't know where there going with the second film but with a cast &amp; a
director &amp; a producer like that (I have seen some of their other work &amp;
it's
really good but The Matrix takes the biscuit - it's just the
best.)
