The Matrix is a good movie and worth watching. It's a combination of
philosophy(what's real of what we perceive; see Locke,Hume,Berkley,etc.),
science fiction and hong kong action movies. This combination makes the
film
great and unique. I think because of this fact everybody is loving
it.
Here in the Netherlands the critics are crazy about this film. Especially
the action sequences are unique; so they say. Obviously they've never seen
hong kong movies before because the action is more or less a copy of the
best(!) hong kong flicks. I don't know who picked Yuen Woo Ping to
choreograph the martial arts but whoever did it definitely knows his kung
fu. Although Keanu Reeves for ones wasn't irritating in a movie I would've
picked another person to play the lead; Keanu looked stiff in the kung-fu
sequences. (Laurence Fishburn looked great.) I was a little bit
disappointed
that there wasn't a stick fight in the movie. If somebody can choreograph a
great stick fight it's Yuen Woo Ping.<br /><br />Overall a good and original movie with somewhat disappointing kung-fu.
(They've copied Woo's action style great though)  8,5/10
