1999_September 6 
I saw &quot;The Matrix&quot; a few days ago. The film is quite good and received
much attention (and publicity) as it promised stunning special effects
around a sophisticated and compelling plot.<br /><br />Well, the effects were as expected for a contemporary, expensive sci-fi
adventure. My only objection are the monitors that presumably display
the undecoded &quot;Matrix&quot;, it is quite a disgrace for those who know a
little about computers (a hint : about how much data do you suppose a
text screen can contain? Enough to describe a virtual world or even
small portions of it?)<br /><br />As for the plot, it is based on the idea of people being enslaved in a
constructed world by an other race, without being able to realize it,
until there comes &quot;the chosen one&quot;, a human who learns the truth and
eventually discovers and puts into use powers and abilities that exceed
those of the &quot;dominant&quot; race. This all sounds interesting enough, but
the basic problem is that the above exact lines of text can be used to
describe another movie. This movie is &quot;Dark City&quot; by the creator of
&quot;The Crow&quot;. If &quot;Dark City&quot; was written prior to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, then the
later lacks originality. The new elements in &quot;The Matrix&quot; scenario make
it seem more complex and more hi-tech, so as to appeal to the audience.
The scenario is also more pessimistic, which is the easier way to
&quot;move&quot; the viewer, in contrast, &quot;Dark City&quot; achieves the same (or more)
just by its dark and gloomy ambiance. So, both movies present a human
nightmare, with &quot;The Matrix&quot; being the more colorful one. The more
complex scenario, which features more technological concepts, such as
Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality therefore drawing more
hi-tech addicted audience, bears one major weakness : an abrupt and
unfulfilling ending. The plot arrives to a point where it simply cannot
continue, as the hero becomes almost a &quot;god&quot; but ONLY for the virtual
world. A scent of victory is the ending, but we immediately realize
that it is virtual (not actual) too.<br /><br />There is a lot of action in this movie. It's a pity the director used
too much of the old-fashioned &quot;slow motion&quot; technique in most of the
fight scenes, which holds back the fast action; in a few scenes the
technique was essential, but in others it was just &quot;easier&quot;. The sound
is excellent and I can say the same for the soundtrack. Keanou Reeves
performed his best (along with &quot;Devils Advocate&quot;) and the rest of the
cast does very well in delivering a stylish (remember &quot;Men In Black&quot;)
and very entertaining film.<br /><br />So, go watch this film, but first watch it's darker flip-side by Alex
Proyas : &quot;Dark City&quot;. As for me, I enjoyed the film, but I believe it
was not worth such a high place in IMDb's top 250. If the plot was
conceived before &quot;Dark City&quot;, then I would rate the movie a 9/10.
Otherwise, a 7-8/10 would me more appropriate.
