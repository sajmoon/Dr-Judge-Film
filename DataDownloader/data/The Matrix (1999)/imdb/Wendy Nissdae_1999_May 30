1999_May 30 

I was so impressed by The Matrix, I have seen it several times since its
release. I find it hard to believe that there are people that did not like
and outright hated this film. My only real qualm is that the premise is
that
The Matrix is a reality that connects all the humans' minds to a
collective
that is set in 1999. Now even artificial intelligence ought to be smart
enough to set us back to a time before computers so that part of logic is
yet undiscovered and we are left clueless. But that is nit pickey and
there
would be no movie in that instance.
Now, what I found so interesting about the movie is how well thought out
the
logic of the way that The Matrix, programs and the human mind work
together
and seperately. I suppose this particular interest is due to my career and
hobbies in computers, but the concepts were conceived from a programmers
point of view, it seems. That within The Matrix, rules still apply as
within
a program brings on a wave of questions and possibilities and lets one
rationalize a lot things in the movie. The geek chic has to be a draw, as
well. A bit predictable, yes, but interesting and visually stunning none
the
less. (By the way, this is the first Keanu movie that my mind didn't hear
the word &quot;dude&quot; after every sentence he said.)
