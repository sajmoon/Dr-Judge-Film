What is the Matrix?  The question upon many people's lips, and on the side
of a few buses in Melbourne, I can tell you.  Well.I could tell you the
answer to that question, but then I would have to kill you.  You
understand?<br /><br />The Matrix, besides being abundant in awesome special effects (mainly
computer generated) also has quite a fictional tale to tell.  The story,
without giving too much away, was very computer orientated, a little
confusing if not paid attention to, fast moving and a little frightening
to
wrap your mind around.  Unfortunately I don't think I can say much more
without giving too much away.  &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; you're going.  No, sorry, I
really can't.<br /><br />This movie was shot in Sydney (so my friends tell me) and quite a few
Aussie
actors make appearances, including Hugo Weaving (Jurassic Park) and Matt
Doran (ex-Home and Away).  Keanu Reeves (even though I don't really think
that much of him) was pretty good in the leading role and depicted his
character as a type of enigma, probably leaving most of the audience to
wonder if.right until the end.<br /><br />After seeing this film and walking out of the theatre, I took a look
around
me and couldn't help but think, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  Definitely one of those
movies that leave you thinking, &quot;But, what if it's real?&quot;<br /><br />If you were pondering the thought of seeing this movie, I would definitely
suggest that you see it in a large theatre, with a huge screen and
surround
sound (or whatever you call it), definitely adds to the
atmosphere.<br /><br />I give it 4 wide, uncomprehending eyes. (4/5)
