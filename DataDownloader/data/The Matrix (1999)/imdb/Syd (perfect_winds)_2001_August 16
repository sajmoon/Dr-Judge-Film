The Matrix is one of the best movies I have seen! It has great stunts. I
thought at first that it was going to be an awful gory movie with computer
animated stunts that you can tell are fake but boy was I wrong! It is
definately the opposite! It has great stunts, and it's filmed to
perfection!
It is the best movie I've seen and I think that you would like it if you
are
into exellent movies.
