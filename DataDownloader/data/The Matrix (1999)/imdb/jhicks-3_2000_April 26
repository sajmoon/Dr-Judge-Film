Its difficult to explain. The film grabs you from the very beginning, making
you wonder what is going on, what it all means, and slowly it starts to
unravel. When you realise what it is that is happening, you then go on to
wonder 'what can they do with that knowledge?' Its not like the secret is
unveiled and the film is over, making you sit back in your seat and think
'wow'. It clips along at a fantastic pace, with enough to watch on the
screen to make sure that you don't have the time, or the inclination, to
turn away. Its a stylish, highly original piece of filmmaking and will be
the milestone for many of its kind for years to come.
