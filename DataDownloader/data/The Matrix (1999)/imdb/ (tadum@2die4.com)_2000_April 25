I usually don't like most of the science fiction movies, but The Matrix was
one of the best movies that I've ever seen. It had wonderful special
effects
and Keanu Reeves was born to play Neo. All the actors and actresses where
great choices. The movie also had a good story to it unlike some that just
seem to go on and on without any reason. Over all it was a wonderful movie.
I hope the second and third are this good!
