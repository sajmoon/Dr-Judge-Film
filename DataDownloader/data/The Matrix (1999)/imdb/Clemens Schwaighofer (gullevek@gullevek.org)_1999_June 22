1999_June 22 

Well, although the story isn't the newest one (bad AI takes
over the control), the special effects and the way it is
made
is really totally different to the 'old' sci-fi action
movies.
I was really impressed and stunned by those slow-motion
action
sequences. They are damn great!
Don't expect too much story, expect great action!!
