1999_April 7 

This movie is the most intense sci fi movie I watched since &quot;Dark City&quot;.
Powerful and original in use of special effect, W brothers directed this
film in top notch.  The casting of the film seems rather perfect.  Keanu
Reeves acting as little as possible purposely of course.  The new face &quot;The
Trinity&quot; character is amazing.  Her act in the film is dynamic and the
stunts are superb.  However, the plot of the movie could have been better..
If it is the question that drives them than should have left question lead
the plot rather than the special effect.  There is a faint hope of Oscars (
it's that good )  Overall, The Matrix is well worth investment of $60 million
dollars for Warner Bro.  I wouldn't be surprised to see The Matrix beat the
sales of coming sequel of Star Wars.  I already purchased another ticket for
coming Friday.  Hey!!  Can't miss out on such a movie playing on theaters. I
have friends going for third time now.  :)
