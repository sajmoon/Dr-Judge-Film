1999_June 7 

Two Chosen Ones in one week! We saw The Matrix on Thursday and Star Wars I
on Sunday. The Matrix was far the better film and the special effects,
relying on people (if computer-enhanced) were much more &quot;real.&quot; The ideas
were maybe not very original, but the overall effect really pulled you
into
the action. Sure couldn't same the same for Lucas' attempt!
