This is one of those movies that I waited to see on VHS and profoundly
regret not seeing it in a theatre.  It is visually stunning and the story is
gripping and original.  Fishburne and Reaves know exactly what they are
doing as do the rest of the completely commited cast.<br /><br />Thomas Anderson (Reaves) is a brilliant hacker working as a programmer
during the day and writing illicit code for the internet at night.  As
happens occasionally in the real world, he stumbles accross what appears to
be another hacker, Neo (Fishburne), who starts contacting him at his home
computer and work.  The world he is finally guided to is a grim shock and
the main story of &quot;The Matrix&quot; is how he learns to function in it and aide
his comrads in confronting it.
