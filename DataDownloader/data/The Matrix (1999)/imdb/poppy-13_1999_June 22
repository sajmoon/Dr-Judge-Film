Great spectacle and visuals. I was a little disappointed by the
story, missing much of the subtlety that a reality v. paranoid
fantasy can include. Total Recall did it better, leaving the
question open as to whether the hero was paranoid, or whether
they were really out to get him .. I mean, all that 'he is the
One' stuff, and the death/resurrection/elevation to saviour
status bit at the end! Maybe it's because it's constructed
rather like a game (games being by their nature
player-ego-flattering, everyone is always the last hope of
civilization, necessitating the massive slaughter of vast
numbers of aliens, drones, zombies, other players, etc). In fact
the A1s virtual world looked like it must have included bits of
Mortal Kombat code in it, from the way they all had to keep
going one on one to sort things out. Images fantastic though -
all that gloomy decay and cavernous early c20th architecture
rubbing up against acres of reflective glass offices (don't they
smash well!). Fine pacing, fancy slomo effects in the action
sequences, and a general sense of slightly pretentious epic
style foreboding gave the whole thing a bit of gravity,
offsetting the sunglasses/le
