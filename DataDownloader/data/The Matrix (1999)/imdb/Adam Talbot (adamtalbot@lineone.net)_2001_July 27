I spoke to a lot of people who lost interest half way through mainly
because
they were not paying attention. Okay..Sci-Fi is not everyone's cup of tea,
but everyone else should really stick with it.<br /><br />The cast is strong, especially Lawrence Fishbourne who draws you further
into their world with every statement he makes&quot; , the choreography is
spellbinding as you start to believe they can do almost anything, the
special effects are Jaw Dropping and the plot is mind-blowing.<br /><br />This film has everything and will leave you thinking about it for weeks
after seeing it...&quot;What if&quot;...&quot;So does that mean he is&quot;...&quot;Are we still
here&quot;<br /><br />I bought a DVD player on the strength of this film and cannot recommend it
highly enough.<br /><br />As the film's tag says &quot;You can't explain the Matrix...You have to see it
for yourself&quot;<br /><br />Brilliant Stuff!!!
