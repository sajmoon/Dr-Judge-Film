1999_April 4 

This movie is as good as it gets.  Too many movies have such a simplistic
plot.i.e MIB, 5th Element ( bad dudes fall in line because of lead
characters coolness). This movie is fresh and doesn't rely on cheezy one
liners and effects. It clues one into what is happening. The fight scenes
are amazing..Jackie Chan, Jet Li, with a sci-fi cyber plot, blow the bad
guys up, for a reason. For the first 15 minutes I really didn't know who to
root for. I would have to say Lucas has to have something really amazing to
top this. It really leaves the viewer wondering how connected they are in
this world...to what is real.
