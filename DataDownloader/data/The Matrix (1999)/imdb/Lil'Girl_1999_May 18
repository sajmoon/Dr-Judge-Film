1999_May 18 

I thought I'd add to the chorus of approvals and thumb my nose at the
naysayers. From my observation, most of those who dislike the movie don't
really get the nuances of the film. Certainly it's not a picture for
everyone and of course there are going to be gaps in aspects of the
narrative. But what work of science fiction has ever been totally
gap-proof?
(Hence, the expression &quot;science-fiction&quot;)
As one of those who enjoyed the movie thoroughly and saw it more than
once,
I believe it contains all the elements of a good movie: humour, a
freshness
about it, and a lot of great action sequences.
Will Star Wars measure up, I wonder?
