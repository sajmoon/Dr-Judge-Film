1999_October 11 

My opinion: I absolutely love it.<br /><br />My reasoning:
Outstanding plot - This brilliant plot keeps your eyes and mind glued to
the
movie for the entire 2+ hours.  It's a really great (if not mind-bending)
feeling when your brain puts two and two together and you discover what
the
matrix really is (a short time before the actual explanation).<br /><br />Outstanding visual/special effects - Filming styles never-before-seen in a
movie, seamless CG constituents, and outstanding &quot;classical&quot; special
effects
add a tremendous amount of eye-candy to an already great
movie.<br /><br />Good music/sound effects - The music's very well-done (not quite &quot;great&quot;
but
close).  The sound effects are great and, at times, quite innovative (the
metallic distortion of Neo's screams, for instance).<br /><br />Overall, it's a really outstanding movie with an extremely original,
twisting plot that really keeps you guessing and continues to make you
think
long after the movie is over.  It's a bit on the cerebral side so people
who
just like pure action and no thought may not be completely impressed (more
than likely, you'll at least like it, however).  It will definitely appeal
to geeks (like myself).  There may be a few slightly, over-dramatic shots,
not bad - but made me chuckle a couple of times (usually facial
expressions
by Keanu).  Believe it or not, Keanu Reeves actually does a decent job
(could've been better, but definitely the best he's ever done).  I saw it
multiple times in the theater (very rare) and also bought the DVD (a very
good disc with a lot of features - BTW).  I give it a very enthusiastic
9/10.
