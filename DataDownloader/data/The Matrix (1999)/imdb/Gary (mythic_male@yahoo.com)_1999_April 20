1999_April 20 

I would LOVE to address some of the negative critiques, but I think some
people look too hard for faults.
This movie not only met, but exceeded my expectations for many reasons too
numerous to list here.  The visuals were stunning and the FX cutting edge.
After seeing the Wachowski brother's &quot;Bound&quot; (another visually beautiful
film), I see why they used the same cinematographer to lens this movie.
Their use of &quot;bullet-time&quot; photography and virtual camera panning (freeze
framing mixed with live action) was done superbly.  Yes, I know we've seen
this done recently for for numerous television commercials (e.g., the Gap commercial mentioned by another reviewer here also), but never with
such technical precision and poetic imagery.  &quot;Poetic&quot; you say?  Just as
Sam
Peckinpah was the first to show us artistic violence with his slo-mo
scenes
in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, Larry and Andy Wachowski have utilized new technology
to go the next step (the helicopter-machine-gun-rain-of-bullets scene was
dazzling!).
The opening sequence with Trinity running from the Agents, leaping from
the
rooftop, then diving through a window in the adjoining building, tumbling
down the stairs and landing face up, guns drawn, made my jaw drop.  And to
top it off, she picked the smallest window!
I didn't find the story line overly complex or convoluted, as I've read so
many have.  I mean, how do you present the concepts of virtual vs. real,
dream vs. waking, or parallel universes in an easily explained manner.
Did
everyone totally understand the parallel time lines and co-existence of
past, present and future from the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy.  I don't
think so!
The Matrix had story line flaws, yes.  For instance, why didn't Morpheus
get
hit by a stray bullet as Neo was spraying a deluge of machine gun fire in
the Agents office?  Why wasn't Neo running away from the agents in super-fast
motion instead of normal speed?  Hey, maybe he was tired!  He did take
quite
a beating.
The movie left me satiated but longing for more.  I was a little
disappointed that we didn't get to see a little more of Neo utilizing his
&quot;oneness&quot; power once he realized it.  Think of the possibilities!<br /><br />I LOVED this movie and, no matter what anyone says, Trinity's &quot;dodge this'
line cracked me up!
