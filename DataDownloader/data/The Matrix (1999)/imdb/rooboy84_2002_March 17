The matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. It's remarkarbly unique
and different and is a weird but wonderful movie. With a bunch of zany,
wacky weird creatures (such as those octopus machine things) and interesting
characters such as agent smith (Hugo Weavings) give this movie so much
difference to your average one. Probably takes the award for the most
uniquness. The way the film looks is unbelievable as well. Dont forget to
watch this!<br /><br />81%
