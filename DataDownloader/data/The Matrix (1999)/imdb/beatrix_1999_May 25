The best thing about the movie was Carrie Ann Moss.  How many girls out
there want to learn kung fu now?  I'm one of them.  I've give a million
bucks to be able to walk up walls like that. Of course, they did it with
wires, so it's not really real.  A big congratulations to Mr. Reeves for
overcoming his stint of bad acting to do something really cool in this
movie.  Mr. Fishburne was magnificent as always.
