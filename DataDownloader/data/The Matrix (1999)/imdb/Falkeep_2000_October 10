I liked the Matrix a great deal but I much prefer this dark vision from Alex
Proyas... the genius behind the film version of The Crow.  I think Proyas
took more chances and relied more on the intelligence of his audience than
on the Matrix's eye-candy.  Besides, I am getting tired of seeing Keanu as
the great savior of the world.  As for why I mention both of these movies
together... they are the same story.  Watch Dark City and then watch The
Matrix and I defy you to come up with a single significant plot difference
between the two.  Any takers?
