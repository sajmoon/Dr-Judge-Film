Right from the start this movie puts the audience into the action,
creating
a bizarre and amazingly cool atmosphere which never lets
up.
The movie is full of surprises and keeps you guessing to the
end.
I think this is one of the best films of all time and i'm not alone.  I
work
in a video store and it has been raved about by nearly everyone I have
questioned about it.
It Rocks!
