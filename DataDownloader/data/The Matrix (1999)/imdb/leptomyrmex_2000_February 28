This movie came highly recommended, and it was indeed very suspenseful and
engrossing.The special effects were spectacular and novel and the acting
quite good. The actors were sleek, cool, and good-looking in the extreme.
As
others have noted, the plot contained a number of serious holes for the
scientifically-minded, but nevertheless, the idea of what it could be like
to have our wet-ware hardwired to a nearly infinitely-powered reality
simulation IS intriguing and fun.
The violence was quite sanitized--hardly any gore, and no sex at all; no
immodest clothing to speak of, yet very stylish and cool--I liked that.
However, I really think that the theme--that if we could only cast aside
all
these mind-squeezing limits and influences, like the CHURCH, government,
etc, then we could conquer EVIL (identified as technology--duh) and become
all powerful messianic supermen if we a) believe in ourselves and b) have
the love of a good woman--give me a break. As a mother, I roll my eyes at
that! Creative freedom within limits--that's a better, healthier
idea.
8/10
