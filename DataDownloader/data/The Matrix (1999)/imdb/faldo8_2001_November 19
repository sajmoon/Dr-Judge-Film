All in all this movie had great production values, it really is a good
slick
movie that's enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />People seem to either love the plot and find it incredibly enlightening
(choke), or think it's stupid.  Well, this sort of thing has been written
about in sci-fi stories for decades.  All the accolades that the Wachowski
brothers are getting for being so &quot;ground-breaking&quot; and insightful is BS.
Stories which address almost identical plots have been around since
cyber-punk emerged in the early 80's.       So they threw in a few
references to christian mythology, so what?  If you find this sort of theme
really interesting, start getting into some anime - Ghost in the Shell is
and obvious classic, and Serial Experiment: Lain is an underrated
masterpiece.<br /><br />Okay, now that's outa the way....  I don't see how people can watch this
and
ooh and aaahh at the action like it's never been done before.  Hong Kong
cinema has been doing this stuff 100 times better for many years.  Go see
Wong Fei Hung.
