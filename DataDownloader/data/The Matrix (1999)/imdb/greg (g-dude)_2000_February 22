<br /><br />The Matrix was one of the better movies of 1999, but the people who call
this movie one of the most inspirational movies ever is out of their mind.
The first hour is extremely weird, and the action does not pick up until
the
gun fight in the building. Only then does the special effects that seemed
to
be promised throughout the movie appear. Granted, Laurance Fishburne and
Keanu Reeves do their best, but the chartecter development is quick and
not
very elaborative. One final nagging is the agents, who look like over
acting
Men In Black.<br /><br />But that's the bad stuff. The good stuff is this:<br /><br />The special effects. I said earlier that they do not really appear until
the
second half of the movie, but its impact is felt throughout.  The part
when
Neo wakes up from the The Matrix is very impressive, as is Neo and
Morphius'
kung fu lesson.<br /><br />The acting. Laurence Fishburne is extremly impressive as Morphius, and
spews
out half of the movie's memorable lines, such as :<br /><br />&quot;No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it
yourself&quot;<br /><br />And that about sums it up. If you read this review looking for insight on
the plot, all I can say is this:<br /><br />&quot;No one can be told what the plot of the Matrix is. You have to see it
yourself.&quot;
