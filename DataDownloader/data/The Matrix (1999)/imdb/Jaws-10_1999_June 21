1999_June 21 

This film is one of pure genius, with Reeves back to what he does best,
and
Fishburn overflowing with coolness. If you haven't already seen this film
then you don't know what you're missing. A film which sets new standards
in
the action genre which many films will have to comply with (which can only
be a good thing). This film has everything and is for everyone.  I have
seen
this twice, and it's just as good the second time. I bet George never saw
this phantom menace coming!
