The Matrix<br /><br />DIRECTION `%
Once the special effects are rolling you might (will) start wondering how
they make the camera bend time and slow it down to see all the
action.<br /><br />ACTING &#132;%
The main good characters show good performances. However it's the satanic
like agents that pull in most of the atmosphere!<br /><br />EDITING/SPECIAL EFFECTS &#152;%
This movie was designed with editing in mind and work and plays like a dream
computer game.<br /><br />PLOT '%
Computers take over the world and uses humans as batteries. However this is
only the cover-up as the movie has got tons of Christian themes throughout
(and perhaps other idealogies). You are the one, who was forseen in
prophecy.... but where is the Judas character lurking?<br /><br />STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC 79%
Much action and sparkling violence with few swear words (if
any)..<br /><br />MUSIC &#25;%
Lots of rock tunes to move the action along. Not what you call classical
music. I was wondering if these tunes have hidden messages within
them!<br /><br />SOUND -%
Loud explosions and other big sounds.<br /><br />HOOKABILITY &#153;%
Can't wait to see or hear what happens next.<br /><br />LASTABILITY `%
You want to know how it will end and if there will be a
sequel.<br /><br />OVERALL '%
The Christian theme is a nice touch. But the movie draws attention to the
role technology is having upon society in terms of our working and leisure
time. If you are reading this then you are on the internet, do you really
trust the internet? Is someone watching you? Are humans becoming like
commodities in a technology based society to be used by the higher unethical
human good? Are you willing to fight the evil or stand back and enjoy your
comforts in life, while you are being manipulated by satanic agents who want
to keep the status quo? For me and many people this is a BIG concern upon
how technology is being used to manipulate people, and this theme continues
with advance uses of genetic engineering. This is not neccessarily a better
movie than ones with lower ratings, but needs these ratings so people can
get informed quickly before it's too late!
