In a word, Wow. Even though I'd read the reviews from this site, I was still
apprehensive. Well, all for naught. From the acting to the imagery to the
action and the slow-mo shots, this movie is all that and a bag of chips. I
walked out with all those shots in my head, and thinking to myself when I
could get back to see it again. Can't wait for the DVD!
