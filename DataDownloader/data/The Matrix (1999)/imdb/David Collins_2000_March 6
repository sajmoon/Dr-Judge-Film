The Matrix takes the viewer into a world of sub-reality and conspiracy
theory. But in this case the plot extends beyond the bounds, creativity and
originality like anything before it. The movie keeps the viewer guessing
between what is reality and what is unreal throughout the entire movie,
which makes it a rather stimulating watch for those viewers who don't mind
a
somewhat complex storyline. The movie though will suit the action fanatic
with an abundance of fight seens, including a memorable one between
Laurence
Fishburne and one of the bad guys. Once you take away the action and
stimulating storyline there is a rather original and unique science fiction
tone around the movie that will please any sci-fi fan. To back up the
excellent movie is a well suited soundtrack featuring mostly heavymetal and
alternate artists that give the movie even extra bite.
