The Matrix is the best Science Fiction movie ever made!  I've never been
so
&quot;geeked&quot; over a movie.  Since the opening last week, I have already seen
it
three times, and unlike most movies, it gets better every time you see it.
It gets better because you pick up on things that you missed the first
time.
Anybody notice what the title of the chapter that was in the book that he
stored his &quot;illegal&quot; discs inside.  The chapter was called &quot;nihilism.&quot;
Defined as :&quot;An extreme form of skepticism that denies all existence.  A
doctrine holding that all values are baseless and that nothing can be
known
or communicated.  A delusion that the world or ones mind, body, or self
does
not exist.&quot;  Think about it....
