This excellent movie had just about everything for me:  special effects
which were state-of-the-art, fight scenes, an excellent plot.  The only
thing I didn't like about it was the length, which made me VERY
uncomfortable in the theatre (almost went to the bathroom just before final
climax).  The plot reminded me of a science fiction series I'd read about
15
years ago.  The author was Philip Jose Farmer, and the series was
&quot;Riverworld.&quot;  Though changes were made, I immediately thought about this
'connection' (whether real or imagined).
