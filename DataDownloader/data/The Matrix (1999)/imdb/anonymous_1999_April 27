1999_April 27 

Note: this movie is best if you don't already know the
plot.<br /><br />When I first saw The Matrix I expected great things, and *WOW* did I get
them. The premise, special effects and mood are all jaw-droppingly clever
and well-done. But upon a second viewing I noticed some gaping
deficiencies:<br /><br />* It gets s-l-o-w in the middle. The bad kind of slow.<br /><br />* Details of how the Matrix works are conspicuously and unfortunately
missing.<br /><br />* The dialog -- although above clich&eacute; -- is lackluster.<br /><br />* Keanu Reeves can't act. I know he tries hard, but when he's not talking
or
fighting he looks like a stunned bunny.<br /><br />Overall, The Matrix is entirely worthy of a single viewing under optimum
conditions. That means in 70mm wide-screen format, digital sound, THX, and
hopefully no pagers, cell phones, crinkly candy wrappers or crying
babies.
