The Matrix was the most action packed sci-fi movie of the decade. I had
never been a Keanu Reeves fan before this movie.
Reeves and Fishburne are a great dual.  The story of the
Matrix
was awesome.  I recommend watching the flic twice to fully understand the
story.  The suspence in the last 25 minutes of the movie was very intense.
The action scenes were by far the best ever.  I would recommend this movie
to any sci-fi, action lover out there.
