1999_October 1 

Keanu Reeves acts like a new Schwarzenegger to eliminate the<br /><br />forces of dark.A movie by the Wachowski Brothers(do you remember the Taviani
Bros. ?) of the Italian school?Science fiction par excellence enhanced with
too many visual effects to teach that the good guy will win again.Many
combats that will create the next Quake-like computer game as happened with
'independence day'.A genious called Morpheus and a girl called Trinity will
support the Chosen(the good guy)in his struggle against the bad guys.A movie
that does not deal with real computing aspects but it rather purports to
show some notional battles based on artificial intelligence.
