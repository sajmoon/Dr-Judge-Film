1999_June 28 

this movie could have survived on the plot alone. strip away all the eye
candy and good acting, and staplegunned the plot in big letters to the
screen, and i'd be first in line. this was easily one (if not number 1) of
the best movies ive seen in a long time. dazzling. a feast for a visual
person. yummy. yummy. yummy.
