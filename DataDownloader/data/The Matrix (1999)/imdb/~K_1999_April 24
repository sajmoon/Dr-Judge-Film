1999_April 24 

I enjoyed Matrix, really I did. But in retrospect, it seems like a rehash
of
every sci-fi film I have ever seen. The base of the plot reminds me of
Dark
City with X-Files and Men in Black elements added for variety. If you're
looking to see something original, don't see Matrix. If you're looking for
an interesting movie that can keep you watching, then go and see it. The
filming was spectacular as were the effects. The performances were good,
but
could have been better. With that biting review, I must remind you that I
liked it.
