1999_April 5 

I had read the April issue of American Cinematographer prior to seeing this
movie, so I had a good idea of how the effects and camera work in The Matrix
were going to look.  Even so, I was truly blown away by the seamless
integration of slow-motion, fast-motion, real time, and CGI work in this
picture.  The camera and effects crews did a great job.  They picked the
perfect pacing to match the intricate kung-fu and gun fight scenes.  They
made my heart slow down, speed up, and stop right along with the action,
which was amazing.  The action scenes in The Matrix are top notch, and make
the movie worth seeing just be themselves.<br /><br />The story on the other hand could have used some work.  I was let down by
the weak ending, and the plot tended to drag in places.  There was a lot of
background information that needed to be relayed to the audience, and this
is where the movie tended to crawl.  The dialogue was uninventive in its
attempt to be pithy, and the over-the-top acting of Laurence Fishburne was a
bit much.  Keanu Reeves does put in a terrific performance, one of the
better performances of his I've seen in an action film, maybe only topped by
Speed.  This film works in the same genre as Johnny Mnemonic, and Reeves'
performance is ten times better in The Matrix.  The rest of the supporting
cast played their roles, but nothing to write home about.  The character of
Agent Smith was played well by Hugo Weaving, but again, the dialogue he was
given tended to get in the way of that.<br /><br />Overall, The Matrix is well worth the money to see.  The action scenes are
top-notch and breakthrough, and the holes in the plot are easily forgotten
in light of the effects.  I recommend seeing it in a THX theater, it will
definitely heighten the experience.
