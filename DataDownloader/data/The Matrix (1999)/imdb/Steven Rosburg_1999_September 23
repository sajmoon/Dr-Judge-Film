1999_September 23 

I can't wait to see this again! There is tons of energy, the special effects
are stunning, and the story doesn't fall flat on its face either. There are
lots of biblical parallels to pick up on. Each character that plays a major
role in the movie is well developed. This movie is just plain great.
