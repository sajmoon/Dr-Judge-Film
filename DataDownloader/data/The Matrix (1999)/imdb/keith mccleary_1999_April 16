1999_April 16 

okay, now I hate to say this, and please don't take this as a flame, but you
guys are idiots.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is not that great.  Granted, the new
&quot;flow-mo&quot; special FX are neat, but they really didn't get used that much,
and not that well either (the Gap commericials are way cooler.)  the whole
&quot;dodging bullets&quot; sequence wasn't too spectacular either.  As for the rest
of the film, well, we all have already acknowledged that it rips off every
sci-fi movie since &quot;Alien,&quot; so I won't harp on that.  I know I'm supposed to
suspend my disbelief and hang on for the ride, or something.  but
considering the &quot;ride&quot; consisted of about four increasingly repetitive fight
scenes and whole lot of grim and meaningless filler, I don't exactly know if
that counts as a good enough reason to praise the film.  And since the
&quot;complex, thought-provoking&quot; plot was explained in the first 30 minutes and
simply reiterated through the rest of the movie, that didn't hold my
attention either.  I dunno, I'm just saying that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was one of the
few movies I've heard get good reviews since the New Year, and I'm still
feeling pretty unsatisfied.  sigh.
