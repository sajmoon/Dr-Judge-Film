1999_April 5 

I thought this movie was great. I loved it. Younger viewers might not like
its involving story but will be blown away by its inventive action
sequences. Its the best action/sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time, and
liked it better than Dark City. The special effects blew me away, and it had
a story to match. Something you don't see with most Hollywood shoot em' up
action movies. I like Keanu Reeves (not a huge fan) but I just thought he
just didn't look comfortable on the screen like he did in other movies like
Speed. Laurence Fishburn was good as the mysterious Morpheus, and the woman
who played Trinity.<br /><br />The Matrix - * * * 1/2
