This was a pure sci-fi thriller. The lobby shootout was amazing, as with
the
specials effects. This film should beat the phantom menace for special
effects this year at the oscars, unless they screw up again. The plot kept
me awake and lawrence fishburne delivered an excellent performance as the
all-knowing morpheus. Some parts were pretty boring, so I give it 9/10.
