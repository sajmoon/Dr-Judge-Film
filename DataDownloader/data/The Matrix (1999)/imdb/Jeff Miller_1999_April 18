1999_April 18 

This was the movie I'd always imagined; creepy, drippy, malevolent sets
like
City of Lost Children &amp; Aliens, interesting plot idea (Is it REAL?),
literally unreal graphics, stunning imagery.
Ever played a cyberpunk-RPG? See this movie. Ideas galore! Dialogue to die
for!
Derivative? Arguably?
Sparse? Possibly.
Better than the sum of its borrowed parts?  You Betcha.
Gonna see it again without a doubt.
