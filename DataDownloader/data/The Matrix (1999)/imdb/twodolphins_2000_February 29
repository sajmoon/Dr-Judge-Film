I first went to this movie thinking that it was going to be another one of
those cartoonish, one-dimensional movies that they jazz up with a little
special effects.  After I saw it for the third time at the theaters, I
figured that maybe I was wrong. This movie probably contains every aspect
that the true Sci-Fi fan &quot;Digs&quot;: Interesting Plot, Cutting Edge Special
Effects, Kung-Fu (Alright not Sci-Fi, but who cares), futuristic gun
fights,
Keanu Reeves (Cool Dude), Laurence Fishburne (Glad he got to do this movie
after that other one), and Sunglasses (Lots of them).  I feel kind of sorry
for the movies to follow. This movie sets a new standard for movie making.
I
don't mind being a &quot;Copper Top&quot; if I can watch movies like
these.
