OK this movie is awesome.  You will have to watch it about 5 times to
totally &quot;get&quot; every nook and cranny of the movie.  With a really good
story
line and awesome effects this movie has to be my favorite of all in the
Sci-Fi category.  Even over the Star Wars episodes.  I give it a 10!!!!
