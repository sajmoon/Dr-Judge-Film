1999_December 8 

l have seen this movie 9 times in the theater, and saw five times more on
VHS. yes..I love this film.
When I first went into the theater, I didn't know anything but Keanu
reeves
stars. the movie wasn't the one that I'd expected, but for me(I am a bad
sci-fi, John woo action addictor)it was really cool. although it was a bit
bored and has a thing of corny, as much as l viewed it got me in awe.<br /><br />actually 'the one' who made me watch this movie so many times like this
was
&quot;Agent Smith&quot;-Hugo Weaving.
I just blown away by his everything. he was the one of the best villains
that I've ever seen on screen in recent movie history.(alongside &quot;Hannibal
Lector&quot;)
some people hate Keanu's wooden acting, It was.. yes..but I doubt any
other
actor could achieve that role so naturally like him.<br /><br />In spite of some bad reviews, it's obvious that this movie &quot;the one&quot;
which
open the new sci-fi film world.
