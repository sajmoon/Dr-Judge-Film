So many people have commented favourably on this movie, there's not much I
can really add. Except that it's incredibly refreshing to see an
intelligent
action movie. It's a real rarity in a society where action movies have
been
getting dumber and dumber. I think this film pretty much sounded the
death-knell for the standard brainless Schwarzenegger/Van Damme genre
(notice how relatively unsuccessful such movies have been since &quot;The
Matrix&quot;
was released). Perhaps &quot;Total Recall&quot; would have been as good as &quot;The
Matrix&quot; if the original lead, Matthew Broderick, had starred instead of
Arnie. Whatever. Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, and the support are
equally fine.<br /><br />If you like this movie, you should also check out Alex Proyas' &quot;Dark
City&quot;,
a film which tackles a similar subject in a completely different (but
equally satisfying) way.<br /><br />Rating: **** out of ****
