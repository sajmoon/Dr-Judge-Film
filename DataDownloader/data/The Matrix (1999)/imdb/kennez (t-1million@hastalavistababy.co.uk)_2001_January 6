This is a great action movie, and the best I have ever seen! I only saw this
the other night, but I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD
today!
The plot is great, the acting is superb and the action is brilliant! The
Kung Fu scene is nearly up to Jackie Chan standards, and the gun battle in
the lobby is amazing.
This film has great special effects, and Carrie-Anne Moss is outstanding as
Trinity.
I can't wait for &quot;The Matrix 2&quot;!
