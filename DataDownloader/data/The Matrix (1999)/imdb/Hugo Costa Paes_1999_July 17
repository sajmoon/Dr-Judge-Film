It's unusual to see a sci-fi movie that's really creative and
interesting. Most of them are just a cluster of special effects with a
poor
script. Their directors intend to entertain us with computer animations
and
amazing scenarios, forgetting that a good idea is much more attractive.
One
could number the best science fiction films ever done without having to
use
more than its fingers. 2001, Blade Runner, A clockwork orange and Alien
would be in the list. And now, so would Matrix.
It's frightening the idea of a world not in a world against
machines,
like in Terminator, but in a world where machines have already won the
battle, and human beings are trapped in a jail for their minds, living in
a
computer-designed program, incapable of realising the truth.
Not only the main idea is fascinating, but the film refers to many
different stories, like Alice in Wonderland, The Sleeping Beauty, and the
very Holy Bible, where Neo, the main character, would be The Messiah.
More,
it mixes elements from western, action, love and dramatic
movies.
Of course, it's not perfect. As Warchowsky Brothers are novices in
the direction business, the actors were poorly directed. But, in spite of
this, they made a very good job.
