I have to say, I was very tempted to write 'AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!' in the one
line summary, as that is my true opinion of this film. However, I thought it
better to be a little more objective than that.<br /><br />I was intrigued by all the talk of how great The Matrix was, and at first, I
was intrigued by it. Thomas Anderson, the agents that came looking for him,
the talk about 'Morpheus' made me interested about just how the plot would
turn out.<br /><br />However, after the blue pill/red pill scene, what had been a nice premise
became very poor indeed. I can honestly say that I didn't care who was 'the
one,' and with all the cryptic phrases and mumbo-jumbo this thing threw in,
I began to wonder whether or not I was watching a bible story. It leaves you
wondering just exactly what this film is trying to say.<br /><br />With the exception of Agent Smith, there was not one character I liked. I
was praying Morpheus would die, as it might have brought this rubbish to an
end. And what was with all those pointless one-liners? &quot;It's Neo.&quot; &quot;Dodge
this.&quot; If I had watched this in a cinema, I would probably have been thrown
out for shouting obscenities at the screen.<br /><br />All in all, a thorough waste of time. The interesting premise, special
effects, and well-executed scene where Neo is being pursued by Smith just
about lift it out of the dung-heap, but they don't compensate for all its
faults.<br /><br />4/10 - Special effects and cryptic messages do not make a movie
