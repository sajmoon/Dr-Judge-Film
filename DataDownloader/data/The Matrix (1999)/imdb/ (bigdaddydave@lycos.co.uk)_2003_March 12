i must admit i don't have the love of this that many people i know
do.<br /><br />Keanu is not cool, i'm sorry.  WHY is he exactly so much smarter than
everyone else? 
 It IS a geek film, its all about computers and the like, but to make it
cool they use bullet time and such.  Just never worked for
me.<br /><br />I found the &quot;deja vu is the matrix going wrong speech&quot; hillarious, many
think it was clever.<br /><br />Over rated by a far.
