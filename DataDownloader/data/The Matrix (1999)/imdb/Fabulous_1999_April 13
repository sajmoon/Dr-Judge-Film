A viewer looks for a good plot, good graphics, good acting, and overall
a good show.
Although 'The Matrix' does not entirely cover new ground, it gives it
audience a tremendous plot, explosive graphics, award winning acting, and
freakin' good show.
It also gives you something to think about after the
movie.
'The Matrix' asks us what we truly believe and what makes these beliefs
true. 'It' is truly everywhere and in everyone. 'The Matrix' is the question
that asks &quot;how real is what we deem real&quot;. Only one person knows. And that
person is...YOU; you are your own CHOSEN ONE.
