1999_April 7 

As was written previously, this movie borrows a bit. HOWEVER, the package
this movie wraps everything together in is phenomenal. The music, the
action, and most definitely the thought provoking plot of this movie make it
worth seeing multiple times. I have had dreams that were probably some of
the most bizarre that have ever been dreamed, but this went well beyond
those. Also, there are aspects in this movie other than the plot that
require thought. Some of the names and symbology have an underlying theme.
Bravo to a movie for thinking people who like a little KILLER action and
visual stimulation on the side!
