I was very pleasantly surprised with the movie. The plot is gripping while
the pace attains break neck proportions in the second half. Keanu is very
good playing his patented role of a guy-caught-in-the-middle-of-something-he-does-not-entirely-understand-but-gives-it-a-go-in-any-case!<br /><br />Highly recommended for sci-fi fans; better to stay away if you are not
one.
