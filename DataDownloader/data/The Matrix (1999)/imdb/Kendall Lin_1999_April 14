1999_April 14 

I had first seen the previews of The Matrix in the theatres and I have to
admit they intrigued me because of the stunning effects.  However I wasn't
going to spend ticket money on a film  with Keanu Reeves.  Then some
friends of mine
who I respect told me that it was actually worth the money and was a
really
good movie.<br /><br />With this in mind I went to see the movie and immediately noticed the
directors and writers (their brothers) were smart to keep Keanu's dialogue
to a minimum.  I also was even more stunned by the special effects.  The
lighting was very reminiscent of &quot;The Crow&quot; (the first) and &quot;Dark City&quot;,
both movies noted for their effects.   Laurence Fishburne gives an
excellent
performance and the casting was done well.  However, Keanu Reeves as the
protagonist actually was a pretty good choice because he plays a very good
dark hero.  Though I would have loved to see Brandon Lee play the main
part.<br /><br />The Matrix was described to me as reminiscent of Plato's Allegory of the
Cave, and if anyone has read this cannon of philosophy it becomes clear
that
the movie is almost a direct modernization.  However, it seems that the
movie could have easily been 20-30 minutes longer.  About half the movie
takes place within the Matrix and the other half in the &quot;real world&quot;.
But,the movie fails to add any depth to either of these two worlds.  Some
more time spent on analyzing how Keanu Reeve's character interacted within
the Matrix would have been very helpful and interesting.  Instead the
movie
begins with him already &quot;feeling&quot; something is wrong with the world around
him, but shows not a single reason why this would be true.  I would like
to
think the writer's did this to minimize Keanu's dialogue and role in the
movie.  Added to the thin development was the corny fight scenes.  The
actual strikes and blows were very well choreographed but there were some
very ridiculous posing which made most of them laughable.  If that was the
goal of the fight scenes (which I don't think it was) then I can't
understand why they were done that way.  The entire theatre couldn't help
but snicker seeing Keanu do Martial Arts pose seemingly for no reason
whatsoever.<br /><br />To sum up, I think the movie bought up some very interesting questions
about
reality and our perception of it.  However the two very interesting worlds
that were created were not developed enough to satisfy my interest in
either.  I came to the site and was appalled to see it ranked #20 on the
top
250 list because of these shortcomings.  I gave it a 6 out of 10 and would
recommend it to a friend as an entertaining action flick that would not
blow
them away.
