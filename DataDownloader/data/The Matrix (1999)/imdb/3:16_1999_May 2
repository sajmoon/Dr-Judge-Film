1999_May 2 

I hate to say it but The Matrix is the worst movie I have seen in a long
time. The only good things about it you can see for free on the TV
trailers.
I was waiting and waiting for something good to happen and it never did.
How
this movie generated the money it has I will never know.
The best part of the movie was the trailer for wild wild west.
