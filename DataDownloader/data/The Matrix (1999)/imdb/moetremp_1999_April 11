The Matrix is enjoyable to watch and possibly even worth the eight bucks,
but the concept is so far-fetched that it falls short of being as thought
provoking as it tries to be. They want you to walk out of the theater with
the Oliver Stone type feeling of &quot;It's a conspiracy, man!&quot; but it doesn't
exactly work. The makers of the movie could have taken an example from Men
in Black, in which the concept of the movie explained some weird stuff that
is in our world so that it would make sense, but The Matrix just introduces
even weirder new stuff.
