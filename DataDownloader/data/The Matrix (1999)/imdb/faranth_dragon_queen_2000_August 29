I loved this movie from the first time i saw it. Very nice music, and
mind-blowing special effects. Superb plot. Besides, it has Keanu Reeves in
it, which automatically makes it awesome. If the sequels are half as good
as
the original, I'll be first in line at the theater.
My favorite parts were the kung fu scenes, and the government lobby.
I
wish I could dodge bullets and leap over buildings. Kinda makes you feel
inferior, doesn't it? I keep hoping that someday, I'll get a mysterious
email telling me to follow the white rabbit, where I'll be introduced into
the Real World.
It deserved every award it got. I was disappointed when Keanu Reeves
didn't get the Oscar for it! Oh well. I'll be cheering for it every step
of
the way. Did I mention that Keanu Reeves is my favorite
actor?
Great storyline. Excellent acting. Even better technical detail. The
movie flat-out rocks. 2 thumbs way, way up!
