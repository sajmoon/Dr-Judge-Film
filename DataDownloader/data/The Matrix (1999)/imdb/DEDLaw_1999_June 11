See this movie and wonder if it's real.  Is our world real or a dream?
Look
at the sky and wonder, &quot;Is that blue?  Or is what I consider to be blue
seen
by someone else as red?  How would I know if they refer to my red as
blue?&quot;.
See the movie and they're the sorts of things you begin to wonder.  You
may
not know what existentialism is, but you'll be thinking
existentially.<br /><br />Religious reality?  See &quot;The Matrix&quot; and draw the parallels between Neo
and
the Buddha, or Neo and Jesus Christ.  &quot;You are my saviour&quot;, says one
character in the film.<br /><br />Andy and Larry Wachowski will make you think with this intriguing science
&quot;fiction&quot; movie and mix it up perfectly with some of the most
mind-shattering action sequences computer animation will as yet allow.
The
slowest slow-motion; the most fascinating movie.
