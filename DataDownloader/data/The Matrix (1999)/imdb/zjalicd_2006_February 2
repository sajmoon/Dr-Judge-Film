This movie offers unique philosophical background not yet supported by
science.It presents great possibilities of human mind.Anything is
possible if you put your mind to it .The real power lies in the way we
think , strenght,speed...becomes irrelevant.If you control your
opponents mind and ideas you automatically control his body movements.
Are we really leading our lives on our own , the way we wont it , or we
live by someone else's patterns and rules just because is right, moral,
usual,acceptable...The hardest thing is to face your life the way it
really is and not the way we think it is. If we learn to use our unique
potentials and develop them to maximum we are doing the right thing for
ourselves and the whole existence. How much is a man able to do depends
entirely on him and how much he knows him self.
