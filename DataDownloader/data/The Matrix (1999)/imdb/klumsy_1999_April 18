1999_April 18 

This movie had a great ending, leaving you wanting more. The dialogue may
have room for improvement, but it got the point across effectively. The
action scenes are the best I've seen in a long time. The one draw back to
this movie is that some people will give it a bad rating or not like it
because they can't understand the plot, which is very deep and
complicated.
You HAVE to think to understand this movie, it doesn't jump out and bite
you
on the... I really like these movies that make you think and are
entertaining
like this one. If the industry can keep making movies like this, they'll
keep me happy for a long time.
