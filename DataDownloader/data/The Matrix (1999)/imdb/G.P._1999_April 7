1999_April 7 

I really liked this movie.  It had everything an action movie fan could
possibly want.  Good stunts (done mostly by the cast), sub-par acting, a
good storyline, and a good plot.  I loved the effects as well.  If those
effects aren't nominated for an Academy Award then I'm sure that everyone
in
the Academy is drunk or in serious need of a good butt whooping!  I liked
the way all the characters and actors seemed to cliche with each other.
And
I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of years we would see &quot;The
Matrix 2&quot; out at theaters.  Bottom line:  it's a martial arts, bullet
stopping, roller coaster ride that will leave you breathless (but not
wanting it to end) when it's all over.  But don't take just my word for
it.
See it.  But see it in a theater with stadium seating or (at
least) THX or SDDS equipped in the theater.
