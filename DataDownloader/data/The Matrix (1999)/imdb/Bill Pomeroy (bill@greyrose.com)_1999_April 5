1999_April 5 

A great movie!  I have seen Dark City, Bound, Hackers, The Crow, and Johnny
Mnemonic.  If you liked all or any of these movies I highly recommend The
Matrix.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves gives one of his best performances along with a great cast.
This was not a &quot;Supporting&quot; cast in my opinion as they each brought
something of their own into the vision of this movie.<br /><br />Among them, Belinda Mcclory whom I believe was a wonderful addition to the
cast.  She brought a bit of attitude and beauty to the screen.  Plus, she
made herself stand-out in one seen while everyone was wearing black, she
wore white.  That's style.<br /><br />And I think that pretty much sums up &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  Style.
