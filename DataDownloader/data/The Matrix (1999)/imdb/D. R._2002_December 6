It is my opinion that, as long as you have decided what you believe, you
can
interpret just about anything into whatever you see.  Sure, there are many
similarities between Neo and Jesus:  the baptism of Christ verses the
extraction of Neo from the matrix; the disciples of Jesus verses the crew
of
the Nebuchadnezzer; the comparison of Cypher's betrayal and Judas'; the
deaths and resurrections of Neo and Jesus, and the unlimited power and
salvation that follows.  All these things are notable parallels between
The
Matrix and the Bible, but are they really that significant?  It is
indisputable that some of these are direct exerts from the life of Christ,
but that certainly doesn't make it a Christian movie.  Maybe The Wachowski
brothers are trying to send subliminal messages, but that's a little hard
to
believe when one exams the saturating violence and occasional swearing.
Maybe they just thought it was a good premise for a story, maybe they
thought it would be a cool remake, either way it's an awesome movie; don't
ruin it by over-analyzing it.
