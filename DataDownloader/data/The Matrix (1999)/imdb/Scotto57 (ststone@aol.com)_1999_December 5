1999_December 5 

Ok, I admit, after seeing the trailers and marketing hype to get me to the
theatre, I didn't want to waste my time.  It seemed to be just another
movie
where most of the budget had been spent on special effects, and a few
actors
with name recognition in order to bring in the bucks.<br /><br />I had time on weekend, and a friend was interested, so I went anyway.  I
was
taken completely by surprise.<br /><br />Yes, there were lot's of special effects.  Yes, there was the set of
actors
there with name recognition.  But, to my surprise was a solid plot, and
credible, solid acting to make it believable and interesting.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a computer programmer who is also a hacker
finds
that his life is not what it appears when a team of people, led by
Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) rescue him from
Pseudo-Reality.<br /><br />The combination of a well written action adventure, with stellar special
effects, great direction and cinematography and a cast that makes it
believable and real makes this film the best action science-fiction movie
since Blade Runner.
