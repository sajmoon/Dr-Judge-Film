I was doubtful of another science fiction movie staring Keanu Reeves, his
efforts have ranged from bad to yuck!!! So I did not see this movie in the
theatre but later a friend of mine with a theatre system put it is and I was
blown away, the Matrix is the best action movie ever, not only is the action
kick ass but the Matrix makes you think about the world around
you.
The Matrix also have two things in it that very few Hollywood movies ever
have a strong black lead and a strong female lead that is not weak and
helpless.
This movie is a classic and for those of you that don't like it you are
going to have to put up with a matrix 2 and 3 so get ready for more
action.
Lets hope the brothers make them as good as the first.
