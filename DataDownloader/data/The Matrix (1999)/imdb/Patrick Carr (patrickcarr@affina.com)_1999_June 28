1999_June 28 

The question what is the matrix, was answered in the movie.  However, one
burning question the movie did not answer was, what made Thomas
Anderson/Neo
the one.  I walked away from this movie of two minds.  On one hand I loved
the fight/special effect sequences.  And I liked how Neo's character
developed.  There was a logical progression in his skills from a novice as
seen in the fight in the dojo to an accomplished master of the matrix.
This
progression did nothing for me but beg the question &quot;What made Neo
special,
why could he do these thing and Morphus or Trinity could not?&quot;  My other
side thought of the plot.  Now I will say it was mind-blowing enough to
have
to accept and understand the concept of the matrix.  I did not feel it
help
the movie to throw in the various subplots, such as the Oracle or the
character that betrayed the group and gloated long enough for the
&quot;wounded&quot;
character to kill him.  And where did this whole I love you from Trinity
to
Neo come from.  Out of the blue if you asked me.
It seemed that The Matrix borrowed heavily from three outstanding movies
to
make one mediocre movie.  The AI machines felt like they had been taken
out
of the Terminator series and the concept changed enough to make the
Wachowski brothers' legally safe.  I also felt that Neo was being treated
like Luke was in Star Wars.  In Star Wars, I understood what made Luke
special.  Finally I feel the Matrix borrowed from Dreamscape.  Here is
where
I felt the plot really fell down.  Once anyone understood the concept of
the
Matrix, they should have been nearly invincible.  Morphus seemed to show
he
understood the concept, yet he could not defeat the Agents.
I guess I liked the fights and the special effects, but the plot just left
too many holes.
