1999_December 17 

This film is by far the best film of 99. Anyone who thinks otherwise is
wrong. Keanu Reeves delivers his best performance yet with the possible
exception of Speed. I hear that a lot of people have been comparing this
film to Bladerunner which, in my opinion, is a consistently overrated
film.
I believe that The Matrix will be hailed as a classic well into the new
Millenium.
