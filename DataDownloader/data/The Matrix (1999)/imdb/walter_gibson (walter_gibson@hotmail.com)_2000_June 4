Now, I'm not a big sci-fi film fanatic(I don't even like Star Wars that
much!), but this film is probably the best sci-fi film I've seen for a long,
LONG, time. The things that I've been most impressed about this film is not
the bullet speed camera trickery, or the martial arts imitations or any kind
of technical merit it deserved the oscars for. I mean they were great, but
as technology advances, they are bound to get better, and we'll soon find
more things to go 'whoa' at. The things that I was most impressed with was
the quasi-biblical quasi-starwars storyline, the ensemble acting.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves looked COOL, and fortunately left the bigger dialogues to Larry
Fishbreath (with his turn as the Obi-Wanesque Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving
(with his cool authoritarian accent). The other actors giving great support
are Gloria Forster as the Oracle (Yoda?), Carrie-Anne Moss as the love
interest and Joe Pantoliano as the Judas.<br /><br />The trouble with these kinds of films is that you come out of the picture
not horrified by the machine-dominated world idea, but become rather fond of
such a situation, and the escapism that it provides. The apocalyptic world
is somewhat romanticied by the film.<br /><br />But who cares when it's so much fun? Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Pure escapism!
