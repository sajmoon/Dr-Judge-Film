Dear Matrix Viewer,<br /><br />With every highly successful film (especially a film involving the Academy
Awards(tm)), there is a backlash some time after release.  There are several
reasons for this backlash, one being that people generally don't like what
they perceive to be &quot;too much success,&quot; whatever that may be for a person. 
Some people seem to feel personally diminished when they witness a great
success -- or they compare a film to a personal favorite, rather than
viewing it 'in isolation' -- for what it is AS IS, not for what it's judged
against.<br /><br />Another reason is that many don't realize a film is *more than the sum of
its parts*.  When a movie is first released, this fact is generally
recognized, and a movie is enjoyed as a whole.  Later, people tend to pick
the film apart, viewing it as *the sum of its parts*, and concluding that
because of the perceived faults in various parts, the movie itself can't be
so great.  The sense of a film as *the whole banana* gets lost when people
pick it apart.<br /><br />Yet another is that people generally get tired of hype.  Many are bothered
by commercial hype, and feel that when individuals hype (enjoy/love) a
movie, some sort of unforgivable sin has been committed.<br /><br />The psychology of a successful film could fill a book.  Notice how well
&quot;Titanic&quot; was received when it appeared on the big screen -- people were
seeing it then as a movie, a whole -- and AS a whole, it's a great film. 
Later, people saw it as the sum of many different scenes, and so it seemed
like a poor film.  It's just too easy to lose the ability to watch a movie
AS a movie after it's been around for awhile, and people pick and pick at
it, until even the greatest film can appears flawed and generally
worthless.<br /><br />Anyway, if you understand some of the psychology behind how films are seen
by people due to various factors, it all starts to make sense.  And (perhaps
unfortunately) it gets to be quite dull watching the (at first) intelligent
comments on a forum like IMDB turn to black and white -- either it's &quot;the
greatest movie ever made&quot; or it's a piece of... well, you get the
idea.<br /><br />THINK, people.  And please, try to see how the effects of *time* upon a
motion picture operate.  Why a film that was initially perceived as a
stunning achievement by both the public and the critics can later be viewed
by many as &quot;lousy,&quot; or alternately become canonized in people's minds as
&quot;the greatest movie of all time.&quot;<br /><br />I still rate The Matrix 10/10.  I still know how to see it as more than the
sum of its parts.  I hope you do, too (or will, someday).
