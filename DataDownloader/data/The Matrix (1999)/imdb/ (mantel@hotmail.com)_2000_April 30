There are several philosophical issues referenced in Matrix, the most
commonly mentioned of which is about the nature of reality.  There's also
the comparison of humans to a virus that takes over all available
resources.
But if you look hard enough, you can find the deeper question of free
will.
Does man control his own destiny?  Is he in fact an unknowing slave to
some
evil external force?<br /><br />These issues are handled so superficially that they end up detracting from
the movie.  It would have been better to skip the attempt at deep
philosophy
and just identify the good guys and the bad guys.<br /><br />What that leaves this movie with is a laughable mix of kung fu, bullets,
and
other sorts of fairly normal physical mayhem intermixed with science
fiction.  A lot of people must feel that these go great together.  This
might be a great movie to spoof if Mystery Science Theater were still
around, but otherwise, I'd suggest getting your kung fu and science fiction
in separate movies.
