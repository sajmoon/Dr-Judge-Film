1999_April 7 

The Matrix is the first great movie of 1999.  The special f/x were
top-notch, and the well-thought plot always kept me on the edge of my seat.
Keanu Reeves was the definition of cool as Neo, and the soundtrack was
great.  I advise everyone to run out and see this movie.  It is destined to
become the best sci-fi film of the year (besides Star Wars: Episode 1, of
course).  GREAT MOVIE!
