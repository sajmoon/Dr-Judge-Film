I didn't watch this in the theaters because I didn't trust Keanu Reeves'
acting ability. Having watched the DVD, I completely forgot about it. I
remember thinking, &quot;I'm blown away.&quot;<br /><br />The story is pure science fiction. It does play on man vs. machine deal,
which can get annoyingly boring if not done right (see Solo, 1996). Matrix
presents us with new camera techniques, Hong Kong style fight sequences
that
some may complain of being unoriginal, but they are in a league of their
own. It's the same delirious breathlessness I felt in Hard
Boiled.<br /><br />How many time did we wish we could learn to fly a helicopter, learn most
forms of kung fu, etc. in a few seconds?
