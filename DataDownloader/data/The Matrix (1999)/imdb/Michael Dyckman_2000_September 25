2000_September 25 

Many moviegoers have voted The Matrix as one of the greatest films of all
time (current ranking on the IMDB 250: 31st), but it does not deserve that
ranking.  It is however, a very good film for its genre(s); a sci-fi
thriller with lots of martial arts. <br /><br />I won't try to explain the plot, because I only started to understand the
story about an hour into this film, and even then am not sure what was going
on. That being said, The Matrix is arguably Keanu Reeves' best film. Reeves,
who is constantly derided as a mumbling surfer dude, fits his role perfectly
as a hacker/possible savior of mankind.  The martial arts sequences, while
somewhat campy, are amazing, and the video-game-like action sequences are
certainly unique (did he really need that many guns, though ?)  Laurence
Fishburne and the always good Joe Pantoliano are also very good in this
unique film.  Among the best films ever ?  Not by a long
shot.
