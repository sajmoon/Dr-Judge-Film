1999_May 6 

I'm not going to talk about the FX or the acting, what bothers me is that
man would kill every living thing on the planet because he was no longer
number one on the food chain.  To take out the sun in order to stop the
AI's
is the sort of spoil-sport action man would take.  I felt little concern
for
the small band of heroes.  Like one of them said &quot;I should have taken the
blue pill and stayed stupid&quot;.  I hope the second movie goes into the
ramifications of informing the sleeping masses without having a way to
feed
or house them.
