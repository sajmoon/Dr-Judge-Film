The Matrix is a modern sci-fi masterpiece!  The direction of the Wachowski
brothers is faultless, they have managed to bring together a world of
action, confusion and struggle in a seamless tour-de-force. The acting (even
from Keanu) is great.  And the martial arts - WOW!!  Apparently, the actors
went through an intensive four month course for this movie...and they
actually do the fight scenes themselves.  Filmed in Sydney, Australia, this
movie is a must-see.
