1999_April 9 

What can I say? It was GREAT. I absolutely loved it. And make no mistakes,
I'm not much of a Keanu Reeves fan. This is how the story goes - nothing
is
what it seems. It sounded all so complicated at first. I'm used to sci-fi
and I love twists but this was totally different. The most amazing part of
it all is that the movie was actually easy to understand and clear in
meaning. And the special effects.... well, I can't TELL you about it but
you'll see. It's awesome! As I said before, I wish there were some elegant
and sophisticated way of saying 'wow'. I'll be using them all
now.<br /><br />Oh, and the fact that it was filmed in my town didn't hurt either. 'Hey,
isn't that where Jenny's dad works?' and 'look, it's Martin place' and
'hey,
that's Centre Point' and 'I swear that guy looks like my chemistry teacher
from year 11!!!!' and so on.<br /><br />I have only one thing to say - GO AND SEE IT! I give it
10/10.
