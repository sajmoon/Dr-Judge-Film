1999_September 27 

Watching this movie felt like reading a 60's sci-fi book (probably where
they got the idea), the ones that makes you think and feel different after
reading.<br /><br />This movie can be compared with todays world of technology and computer
viruses...  except that the roles are switched...<br /><br />The negative things:
The plot could have been a little more worked out.
And please, please, please change the actors (this is not an option
;-)
