1999_April 13 

What A Flick!!!  I saw it, got into a conversation about it at work and went
with a co-worker to see it again.  I have not seen a Sci-Fi movie with this
much thought in its conception and effort to bring the visual idea to the
screen since the &quot;Terminator&quot; or `Star Wars'. I could only imagine what a
great book it was (if it was ever a book) or would have been.  Then to top
such an interesting story.... the movie was made like nothing I have ever
seen.  The flips, defiance of gravity and physical acrobatics were just too
much.  I saw `The Making of  The Matrix' on HBO and I know sport teams that
don't train as hard as the actors did for this movie.  UNREAL!!!  Keanu
Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss  and Hugo Weaving were
exceptional in their portrayals.  I am not a major Sci-Fi movie goer but I
am a constant movie goer and if a film is good, I will give it its due.
This is a Must See.<br /><br />DHM
