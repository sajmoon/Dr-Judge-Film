1999_April 6 

This is THE movie to see.  This may be the best Sci-Fi/ action movie since
Terminator 2, it might even be better.  Not wanting to give away the plot,
this movie shows what could happen if we don't watch ourselves.  Fishburn
is
AMAZING!!! The graphics are the best I have seen!!!!  If you are going to
the movies between now and May 19th (Starwars)  then you have to see The
Matrix, and even after May 19th, see it,  &quot; because you have to see it to
understand it, I can't describe it &quot;
