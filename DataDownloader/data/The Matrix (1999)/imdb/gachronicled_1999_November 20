I absolutely LOVE this movie!  It's definitely the best I've seen this
year.
It's going to be hard to wait for the second installment, which will
hopefully parallel the success of Star Wars' sequels.  The special effects
are never enough by themselves; this movie had a great story which the
effects only enhanced.
