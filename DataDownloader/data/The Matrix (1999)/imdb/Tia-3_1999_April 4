1999_April 4 

The Matrix, in my opinion is the best Sci-Fi movie since the original Star
Wars. The special effects are great and the acting is good. Keanu Reeves
gives his best performance since his role in the Devil's Advocate.
Carrie-Ann Moss is just plain excellent as Trinity. And Laurence Fishburn's
performance as Morpheus is one of his best. Hugo Weaving's sinister Agent
Smith is the perfect villain. All this combined with great special effects
and some of the best action sequences outside of a John Woo film, this movie
is a winner and multiple viewings are a must.
