2000_June 1 

It seems most people either loved this movie or hated it. My reaction was
more middle of the road. I liked the mind-blowing premise of the whole
thing, was well as the religous/mythological symbolism. I think they could
have done with a little more of the acrobatic kung-fu stuff and less of
the
boring shoot 'em up scenes. The performances were really quite good for a
film in the sci-fi/action genre, with the exception of Keanu Reeves.
This would have been an
infinitely better movie if they had cast a good actor in the lead role -
or
at least someone capable of expressing something remotely resembling a
human
emotion!
