Everyone told me I had to see this film as it was brilliant.<br /><br />2 1/4 hours later I was thanking God that I hadn't paid to see
it!<br /><br />The storyline is just a bunch of other films and novels thrown into a
blender... they would have gotten better acting from a few planks of wood
with faces drawn on them... and for the special effects they should have
got
a bunch of pre-school kids with crayons.<br /><br />A score? 3/10 and that's purely 'cos they used Nokia 8110's!
