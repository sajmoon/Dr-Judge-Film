&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, &#39;cause right now I&#39;m thinking the same
thing. Actually, I&#39;ve been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh
why didn&#39;t I take the blue pill?&quot; - Cypher<br /><br />If there was one sci-fi movie that defined the 90&#39;s, it would have to
&quot;The Matrix,&quot; arriving late in the game in the year of 1999. With
school-shootings and &quot;Y2K&quot; bugs baring down on the masses, it was only
appropriate that a sleeper-hit such as this one came along to truly
capture and define the end of the century. Whether it was fate or
chance, the brothers Wachowski managed to create a film that not only
captured the imaginations of its audience as well as played off its
fears, but a film that -- ten years later -- holds up and marks a high
point in American film-making. Simultaneously matching and surpassing
the groundbreaking special effects and outlandish action-sequences of
1991&#39;s &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day,&quot; &quot;The Matrix&quot; set a precedent that
no modern film has yet to live up to, despite the mixed feelings that
stem from its two sequels.<br /><br />Imagine everything you know is not real. A fabrication, as a matter of
fact. Your whole life, you&#39;ve been asleep, dreaming that you&#39;re living
out your rote, uneventful existence. You constantly search for answers,
for the meaning of your own existence, to no avail. That is, until
somebody opens your eyes, waking you to a new reality, a new world. A
world where you are an unknowing slave to technology (subtle social
commentary, eh?) and the world you thought you knew is nothing more
than a computer program fed to you while you sleep. Such is the premise
of &quot;The Matrix.&quot; Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Andersen, a computer hacker
who lives at his computer and could care less to socialize, let alone
get up and go to work each day. He lives in cyberspace under the
codename &quot;Neo,&quot; not realizing that he himself is being pursued. Soon,
he is extracted from the fabricated world &#150; The Matrix &#150; and faces a
harsh reality through the assistance of a philosophical leader by the
name of &quot;Morpheus&quot; (Laurence Fishburne) and a fellow hacker, &quot;Trinity&quot;
(Carrie-Anne Moss), where he comes to learn his purpose is
astronomical, Christ-like, even. He does battle against the agents &#150;
led by the sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) -- who keep The Matrix
in check, all in an effort to salvage what remains of the free-thinking
human race.<br /><br />Notorious for its mind-bending special effects as much as it is for its
philosophical and religious undertones, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a film that, as
it nears its tenth anniversary, remains relevant today. With repeated
viewings, the film still looks fresh and feels brand new. Despite the
fact that the &quot;Man vs. Machine&quot; theme present has been done to death in
other films, it is tackled by the script in a way that is both
unconventional and definitive. Its impact was immediately felt on
pop-culture, and still resonates today. It&#39;s more than just loud,
shoot-em-up fun with stunning visuals. It&#39;s also a timeless portrait of
where society currently sits and where its unknown future is heading.
Social commentary aside, though, it&#39;s still incredible entertainment. A
well-rounded, well-made film that will stretch the imagination for
years and whose impact should hold up as a benchmark for future
classics to live up to.
