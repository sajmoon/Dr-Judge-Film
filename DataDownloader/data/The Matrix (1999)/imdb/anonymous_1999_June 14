1999_June 14 

This is the perfect film for the dimmer bulbs in the comic book geek
population.  The laughable &quot;profundities&quot; -- unaccountably uttered with
deep
foreboding and a straight face -- sound like a bad mix of Yoda, Rod McKuen
and your average neighborhood stoner.  And how are we to not laugh
outright
at the sight of a toddler yogi bending spoons with the power of his mind?
The &quot;what-is-reality?&quot; theme is as old as the dream state itself, and The
Matrix offers no real contribution to the debate.  The imagery, while
lovely
and inventive, and the direction, although deft and punchy, mask (all too
effectively for some) the lack of a true, unique vision from the
filmmakers,
who demonstrated so much more on a much smaller scale in Bound.  However,
if
your sense of film history only extends back to Dark City and your
philosophical preoccupations were ignited by The Sandman, this whole
muddled
film is all gonna seem mighty big and new.  But, hey, at least it's
entertaining.
