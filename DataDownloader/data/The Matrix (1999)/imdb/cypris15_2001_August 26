This is truly a great movie. It will definitely become a classic as time
goes by. I enjoyed this film every single time I watched it. But it was
best
the first time I watched it. If I had 1 wish in life it would be to watch
the Matrix for the 1st time again. Everything was just so out there, so
amazing. If you watch it carefully you will notice references to the Bible.
My friend pointed this out to me and it absolutely shocked me. I only need
to see this movie in 1 more way. On a Large Screen Digital TV with surround
sound. That would truly be the greatest.
