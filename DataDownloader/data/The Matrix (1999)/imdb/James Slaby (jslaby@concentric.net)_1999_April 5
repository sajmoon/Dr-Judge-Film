1999_April 5 

When the audience laughs at every line the hero utters, but it's not a
comedy, that's NOT a good sign. I loved the FX, fight choreography, art
direction, costumes, and the performances of Fishburne and Weaving. The film
has a not-braindead plot and a couple of genuinely memorable, chilling
images. But I found Reeves, the dialog, and the pacing appalling. Great
action pictures deliver on all fronts: this one had me looking at my watch.
A shame, really.
