2009_April 5 
I just watched this today on my 50&#x22; plasma, after not seeing it for
years. And I realized this has got to be one of my favorite sci-fi
movies. Each character has a story, and the way everything ties in
cannot be fully understood the first time it&#x27;s watched. Watching it
today after seeing it about 5 times in the past, it was even more
satisfying than the first time, because I could see all the nuances;
from the first words spoken that don&#x27;t make sense till later, to all
the foreshadowing by the oracle and Trinity; not to mention SFX; this
movie ROCKS! I&#x27;m not a fan of action movies for the sake of action. I
need an interesting plot that is brilliantly realized and characters I
care about. That being said, if you think Gone with the Wind and The
English Patient are the best movies ever, then I have no idea why
you&#x27;re even reading a review of a movie in this genre. However, if you
like action, conspiracy and sci-fi, then this movie is not to be
missed!
