1999_April 9 

All right, let's get one thing straight. Anytime a movie comes out that
gets
most of its attention from its special effects, people will start
complaining, &quot;Oh, they did great with the effects, but the story will
probably be lame(Twister, for example.) But The Matrix had one of the most
original and compelling stories of all time. The Special
FX were wonderful and will set a new standard on how to create good FX.
The
normally terrible actor, Keanu Reeves, pulls off a good performance for
once, and Laurence Fishburne is good as always. This movie was perfect and
deserves a perfect 10.
