All the technical aspects of &quot;The Matrix&quot; are excellently done.  The
energy
of this movie absolutely surges through its viewers.  And the concept of
how
machines utilize human beings is intriguing.  But it seems like a third
act
is missing.  I desperately wanted to know what would happen if the heroes
won, instead of having an open ending which seemed so unfair to the
audience.  After carrying the audience through a wonderful ride, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; stops short of delivering a knockout punch.  If you want to see a
movie that is just as well done with an incredible ending and similar
story
line... see Dark City.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; could have been so much better... a souped-up version of Dark
City... but it is still a visually intoxicating movie with an interesting
plot.  It is worth seeing.  But if you've seen Dark City... you might be
disappointed.
