1999_April 5 

The Matrix is the first film I've seen in years which warranted paying full
price to see at the cinema.<br /><br />Several months ago I saw the early preview trailer for the Matrix.  I was
blown away!  Everybody in the theatre sat slack jawed afterward for about 10
minutes.  Mysteriously, after seeing previews and ads for a few weeks, they
seemed to disappear.  When the trailers reappeared and a release date was
announced I tried to temper my enthusiasm.  Rarely does a film with such eye
popping effects in a trailer deliver on that promise.  I fully expected to
pay my $8.50 and find the best material was in the trailer. All I knew of
the Wachowski brothers at that point was Bound.  Great modern noir thriller
Bound was (and it really was) it didn't exactly set me up for a brilliant
cyber punk sci fi action thriller<br /><br />The thing which elevates The Matrix from simple eye candy to great cinema is
the fact that the special effects don't exist merely to be pretty.  Every
effect makes sense in the plot.  The stop and circle around perspective
effect first unveiled in the memorable Gap advertising campaign last year,
used again in Wing Commander, is utilized here in such a way that the action
wouldn't have made any sense without it.  The cgi effects manage to work
without that over slick seamlessness which so often makes them look
ridiculous.  Instead the film makers have created a world where every cgi
character seems perfectly at home.<br /><br />I am not the sort of person who normally sees a film twice, with so many
great movies out there I can barely manage to get to see everything I want
to once!  After two viewings I am still impressed by the visual impact of
this film.   Every aspect of design from great costumes to really great sets
is there.  The men are dressed as sexy as the women yet nobody looks
ridiculous.  When Keanu goes to his work cubicle even those of us who've
never had a corporate job know how he feels.   As great as it all looks the
film still manages to be plot driven, rather than an exercise in visual
coolness.  There is not a moment wasted.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves has often been criticized for his performances, perhaps because
he has picked a couple of inappropriate roles for himself.  In The Matrix he
works well.  His martial arts sequences are wonderfully performed as well as
being amazingly choreographed.  He has a couple of lines which even make him
appear to have a sense of humour about himself.  If you look at his entire
body of work, he has done as much good work as bad but his bad work is sooo
bad!<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne, of course, is as brilliant as ever.  Carrie-Anne Moss is
a woman heroine rather than a pretty sideliner.  As a woman I particularly
enjoyed seeing a female character who is pretty and tough without being
either of the extremes we are accustomed to in film.  She isn't Linda
Hamilton steroid tough.  She's not an unbelievable pretty girl like Denise
Richardson in Starship Troopers.  Joe Pantoliano is one of those bad guys
who audiences love to hate.  He is not simply evil, he appears to take great
glee in his badness.<br /><br />I am writing this review because when I drove to work this morning the
morning radio guys were talking about the film.  They enjoyed it but
essentially dismissed it as &quot;eye candy&quot; while berating Keanu Reeves'
performance.  I simply can't believe they saw the same film I did!  To me it
ranked right up there as a perfect futuristic science fiction piece with 12
Monkeys and Blade Runner.    When it comes out on DVD I'm sure Ill be buying
it!<br /><br />Of course, after having said all of that, if you weren't impressed by the
trailer, you probably won't like the film either.
