What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? How about
this: black long sleeve designer t-shirt + lightning fast Kung-Fu special
effects = &quot;ooh-la-la!&quot; That aside, the plot is absorbing and it longs to be
greater than an ordinary sci-fi film; it is it's own world, it's own look
with it's own sensibilites. Nightmarish and paranoia-inspiring at times, but
also filled with hope for rising above this dismal future (the sequels will
cover those stories!)I have the video and I admit that I sometimes watch it
for purely beefcake reasons (I am a naughty girl)and to look closely at the
cool clothes Carrie Ann Moss wears, but to overuse dead slang, this movie is
all that in black stretch-vinyl trench-coat with a small armory in the
lining!
