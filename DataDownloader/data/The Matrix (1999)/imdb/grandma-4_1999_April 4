1999_April 4 

I took a 13 year-old and a 6 year-old boy to see this movie.  I have not
been impressed with a movie like I was this one for a long time.  The 6yr
old made comments like, awesome, and far-out.  I think it was well done and
very entertaining.  I will definitely purchase this when it goes on the video
market.  My advice, &quot;Go see it&quot;.
