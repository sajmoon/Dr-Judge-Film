I don't get why everybody loves this movie so much. It's just not that
good. On its own merits, it deserves more than the one star I gave it,
but when you factor in the annoyance factor of the gushing fans...
well, let's say I just felt a need to counterbalance its high ratings.<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of
Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly.
The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed
utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and
sticking to them.<br /><br />Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its
ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the &quot;science&quot; part of &quot;science
fiction&quot;. So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing
mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film
jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character. (nevermind
that the mystic nonsense is somewhat demystified in the sequel films;
this review is about *this* film). Yeah, dropping in an all-knowing,
cryptic prophetess, without the tiniest hint of explanation of her
abilities, makes for a convenient plot device, but defies all reason or
sense.
