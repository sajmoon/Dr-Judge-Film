The Matrix is a classic special effects movie in a similar way Jurassic Park
is, it has ushered in a new age of special effects that will rule the cinema
for the next decade but the actual film is below average at best. Everyone
now knows about the lobby shoot out and the 'I know Kung Fu' sequences (now
surpassed by Crouching Tiger') and they deserve all the praise they get its
just a shame that they're ruined by the dull and lifeless characters. How
Reeves gets acting work in Hollywood I have no idea, every-time he speaks
you want to point and laugh at his blank expressions and awful line reading,
there is more charisma in a dead fish. Moss (who is so good in Memento) is
not much better and Fishbournes philosophies make you wish Agent Smith would
just kill him and be done with it. Dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in
Dr Strangelove ('Its a killing machine designed for one thing') and good
plot with some first rate ideas is wasted by the directors, the cool of
people in suits doing Kung Fu in slow motion wears off pretty quick on
repeat views. It is however a landmark in action cinema if only for the last
30 minutes, it is destined to be copied for years to come by second rate
action and science fiction movies and for that I give it 5/10.
