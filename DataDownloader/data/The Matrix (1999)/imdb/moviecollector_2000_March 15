This movie just amazed me with its excellent special effects &amp; excellent
action sequences. This is Keanu's best movie yet &amp; the perfect role for him.
Fishburne who also starred in the excellent Event Horizon, shines here 2. &amp;
Trinity(Carrie Anne Moss) really &amp; literally kicks butt. It maybe confusing
the 1st time around &amp; thats y u must see it again &amp; again. This is
mind-boggling, sci-fi thrill ride that every action &amp; sci-fi fan must see &amp;
have in their own collection. I can't wait for the sequels. &quot;Follow the
white rabbit.&quot;
