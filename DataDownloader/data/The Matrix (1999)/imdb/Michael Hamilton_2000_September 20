This has become my all time favorite Sci-Fi film!  Sure the classics are
great and the Alien series (first 2), Blade Runner, et. al, are just amazing
films too.  But this has even more everything than them.  More story, more
ideas, more plot, more acting, more F/X, more graphics, more character
development.  The plot is really well thought out, which is often the
problem with the other strictly F/X films - that thought didn't go into
them!  This has some really great acting, great and memorable lines
(especially from Keanu), slick and sexy fashion, UNBELIEVABLY great F/X, and
a real story!<br /><br />See this film - I can't rave enough about it.  It's simply awesome.  It is,
on my scale, a nearly perfect film - and there are only a hand full of
those!  So I have to give it a 9+++++/10<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!!
