1999_June 19 

Would you take the red pill or the blue pill? Such a question of unknown
life-changing capability has changed the lives, or the views of their
lives
of many individuals.<br /><br />A film with such mind-blowing power and complete and utter sense of
rocking
your every day normal lives needs a lot of explaining, so get this: What
if
our every day normal lives were really just a dream, and we are used as
mere
battery packs for the machine world. What if we were stored in
gloop-filled
incubators with long tubes down our heads? What if. that was the real
world
(whoa! as Keanu neatly puts it).<br /><br />Such an inventive masterpiece would have to come from the Australian's
Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), who co-wrote the screenplay for
'Assassins' in '95 and are responsible for nearly everything on 'The
Matrix'. Not often does everything fit in, with an excellent cast and
crew.
Keanu Reeves' acting skills goes from wooden to quite flexible! Laurence
Fishburne certainly proves he's still got it, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a
vital, convincing role as a leather-wearing cyber-space
assistant.<br /><br />Thomas 'Neo' Anderson (Keanu Reeves), exec by day, hacker by night, gets
contacted by a mysterious Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) who wants to
meet.<br /><br />One red tablet later, and he is in a dark, nuclear-filled sky planet,
filled
with E.M.P. scared creatures and unbelievable special effects.<br /><br />That's when the fascinating Chinese art of 'flo-mo' (when the camera
freezes
and spins around) kicks in. But that's not all they have to worry about.
Agent Smith (fellow oz, Hugo Weaver) and other agents have the same
ability
as Neo and the gang and are very hostile.<br /><br />Add a million special effects, each superb and original in it's own way,
excellent acting from the whole cast (especially Reeves and Fishburne),
and
definite room for a sequel or even a prequel.
