The Matrix will undoubtedly be hailed as a truly classic movie for years to
come, reaching levels close to that of Star Wars. The two films (or sets of
films) are both packed with spiritual truth, accounting for their timeless
quality. It's the same reason we still love Shakespeare.<br /><br />When I first watched The Matrix something about the central ideas rang true
inside me, they really hit home and intrigued me. (I'm aware that many
people will read this and think I'm talking c**p but hear me out) in an
attempt to find out more I studied various belief systems concerning
'reality' and the implications of fully controlling one's perception of it,
eliminating doubt and fear, through pure belief in Self. The whole thing has
led me into an intense inner journey and a total reassesment of life and its
purpose. So Cheers to The Matrix for triggering the whole thing off.
Whenever I watch it now I discover something new.<br /><br />In addition to all of that, the film is utterly stunning as a piece of
visual entertainment. The fluid Woo-style violence is a pleasure to watch
and the close-shave action sequences staple you to your seat. I love the way
the first half of the film feeds you the theory and the second half treats
you to the practice. This movie went beyond thought-provoking - I left that
theatre a changed man.<br /><br />It may be dressed as a big, fat, money-hoarding, film studio product but the
Wachowski's are simply using that as an effective vehicle through which to
communicate this spiritual message to millions of people. Incredible.
