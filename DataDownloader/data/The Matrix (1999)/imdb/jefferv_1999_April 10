1999_April 10 

Let me start off by saying that I was intrigued by the
premise
of this movie.  However I believe the Hollywoodization of
the
plot turned what could have been excellent into boring
rehashed
crap.  Keanu Reeves is about as good an actor as Nick Cage!!<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburn is good if not somewhat understated.  The
overall look of the movie was excellent.  The
special effects were way above par. The main area that this
film
falters is the fact that somehow this way out futuristic storyline suddenly
reverts to a love story about kung-fu!  I
don't understand why the film couldn't have been just as interesting without
the abrupt change in the story.  It just
seemed silly and geared toward garnering the all important
teen
movie crowd.  I recommend seeing this film, especially in a theater, how
ever I was extremely disappointed that the writers, who also happen to be
the directors, chose the course that they did.  This is in no way the
classic sci-fi/action movie that so many seem to think.  AVERAGE AND
TYPICAL!!
