1999_April 8 

Some of my favorite movies include Dark City (great original sci-fi plot),
Rumble in the Bronx (incredible fight scenes),  Hard Boiled (slick action
direction), L.A. Confidential (superb direction and dialogue), and Dead
Poets Society (forces to examine your own existence).  What happened if you
threw all of these movies into a melting pot?  A big jumbled mess, right?
WRONG.<br /><br />Somehow, someway, the W. Bros. have figured out a way to combine all of
these elements to create a film that sparks the imagination and dazzles the
eyes simultaneously.  Never before have I seen such a film that could cover
this many genres at once.  Throughout all of the masterpieces I've seen in
my days, only The Matrix has brought me back to the same movie more then
once.  The quality of this film is so overwhelming, that I've now seen it 3
times in 6 days!<br /><br />Star Wars is known as having one of the most intricate &quot;universes&quot; in sci-fi
history.  The trilogy spawns books, comics, tv shows, and video games.  The
universe created in The Matrix is SO detailed, it has the same potential.
You learn an incredible amount about the world which exists in the film, but
you don't notice it because you are being distracted with cinematography,
acting, action scenes, and special effects that are undoubtedly Oscar
worthy.<br /><br />The characters, you ask?  The Matrix creates genuine personalities that seem
to have been made for each actor/actress.  Believe it or not, Keanu Reeves
as Neo plays a great sympathetic hero we can all relate to.  His reactions
to odd events are on the money, and Neo can sometimes have a certain
playfulness about his abilities (look for it!).  Lawrence Fishburne
triumphs as the enigmatic Morpheus, delivering powerful dialogue exactly the
way it was intended.  Carrie Anne Moss's emotionally bottled up Trinity
fills the gaping hole that Linda Hamilton left with her performance in
Terminator 2.  Finally, the return of the butt kickin' woman!  The biggest
surprise, however, goes to Hugo Weaving for his portrayal as Agent Smith.
So many other actors could've made this another bland antagonist, but
instead they fished out Hugo from the land down under to give movie goers
one of the most memorable bad guys to date.  I know I'm leaving some other
interesting characters, but I'd be here forever.<br /><br />One criticism I hear over and over about this masterpiece is that it borrows
from this movie, that movie, blah blah blah... All I have to say is EVERY
movie borrows from many different sources.  In all honesty, there is no such
thing as originality!  You could easily say Star Wars stole from The Bible,
Shakespeare, Cereno de Bergerac, midieveal philosophy, and pirate
movies...so I could say, &quot;Star Wars?  hah!  how unoriginal!&quot;  If you think
it hasn't been done before, chances are you're just not looking hard
enough.<br /><br />Are you one of those people who skip to the last paragraph?  If so, here's
my review in a nutshell: Go see The Matrix.  Then go see it again.  If you
still don't understand why we'll remember it for years to come, see it
again.  I apoligize for any other intricacies of The Matrix I forgot to
mention; you usually don't come by a film with so many.  For the first time,
I can say this movie &quot;has it all.&quot;  Such an over used cliche doesn't deserve
it half the time, but trust me, this does!<br /><br />10 out of 10, without a doubt.<br /><br />As far as sequels / prequels go, I want more Matrix, but I fear that poor
installments would detract from the sheer beauty this film possesses.  Only
time will tell.
