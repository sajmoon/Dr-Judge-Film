1999_June 13 

An excellent film.  Great acting, special effects and fight scenes combined
to make one of the most original Hollywood films for quite some time.  In
my
opinion the plot is intricate but not overly so.  You've got to concentrate
in this film or it'll go over your head as i think it did some critics.
