When i first saw matrix i thought i understood it all, then i saw it again
and i realized that i didn't understand it the first time. now that i do i
tell people to see it again cause it's just...yeah it's a good movie. the
Flo-mo filming is such a good touch i just wish they used it more, as for
reeves he was a good choice mainly cause i think he fits the hacker/cyber
roles after johnny.  awesome fight sequences. what else is there to say - dam
good movie.
