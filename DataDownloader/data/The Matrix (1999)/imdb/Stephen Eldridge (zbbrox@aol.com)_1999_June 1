Yes, the Matrix wasn't completely original. There were plot elements
that were similar to Dark City, Terminator, Total Recall, The Truman Show,
and Greek Philosophy. However: It blended aspects form all of these movies
into a single story that grabs the viewer both intellectually and
visually.
First, the plot was neither &quot;non-existent&quot; as some claim, or
&quot;overly-complex&quot; as others do. It was fairly straight forward, but posed
many questions. They were, for the most part, answered in the film, but
*only* in the context of the film. It is not a film that tells you, it's a
film that asks you.
Second, It has become far too &quot;cool&quot; to be uncool. Pretentious twits
who harp on movies for using special high-tech special effects, having
action sequences, or giving the main characters sunglasses don't seem to
realize that these things all serve the same purpose as the half-baked
love
story inserted into &quot;Titanic.&quot; They are there to give the audience an
emotional response as well as an intellectual one. They inspire excitement
and awe... Which is at *least* as valuable as any masochistic desire to
cry
at a sad film. Emotional response, in whatever form, is valuable, and the
Matrix pulls off these things exceedingly well.
In short, The Matrix is an excellent balance of intellect, action,
style, and awe. If you give the plot half the attention you give the
effects, you won't be disappointed.
