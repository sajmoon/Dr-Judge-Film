Matrix presents interesting concepts about time and space and certainly
has
plenty of action.  However, while it is billed as science fiction, there
is
little to no science.  The movie's greatness all lies in its
action.<br /><br />In a science fiction movie I always hope for some science being part and
parcel to the plot.  There are few such movies out there that do this.
The
Philadelphia Experiment (1984), Andromeda Strain, &amp; The Thirteenth Floor
do
this.  But they are few and far between.  Some science fiction novels that
do this are Dune, Battlefield Earth (the best in this regard),
Resurrection.<br /><br />But those looking for action and thrills will not be disappointed in
Matrix.
Just don't look for any science fiction.  There isn't any that will
impress
or interest you.
