2000_February 7 

This movie has moved into my list of top Science Fiction favorites along
with such films as `Blade Runner', `Dune', `Star Wars', `Soldier' and
perhaps even `The Fifth Element'.  The whole name game was interesting,
from
the religious perspective.  Neo (which means New) was indeed a new breed of
hacker and so did turn out to be the 'savior' of all, with his side kick
Trinity - her name gave me a whole Catholic vibe.    Lawrence Fishburn's
character was, of course, a type of John the Baptist.  He was a voice
crying
out in the wilderness, and was very much on the verge of dying the same
inauspicious death as John.  Zion was the main frame, heaven itself.  The
Oracle or prophet was interesting, and gave us the only non-Christian twist
with her Dali Lama like search for 'the one' among the psychically gifted
kiddos in her lime green apartment. That whole scenario was right out of
Little Buddha, which, ironically, Keanu also starred in.   Thank goodness
one of the Lamas offered the wisdom of the spoon to our Jesus (neo).  We
are
even given a Judas, who betrays our savior for the mere thought of some
steak and wine, quick and happy to take his bag of Silver.<br /><br />How about the writers poking some fun at Bill Gates with the window
cleaners
making their loud squeaking cleaning noises.  That is right off of a
Windows
screen saver.  Also fun with them picking on Oracle as the prophet, that
name couldn't be accidental with Oracle as the leading data base vendor in
the world right now.  This didn't escape the writer's attention.<br /><br />We of course followed a bit of Alice in Wonderland with the White Rabbit
leading him to the Disco, and then to Trinity.   Lawrence Fishburn then
offers him a red or blue pill, and then the scumbag Judas character gives
our savior a sip of his home brewed liquor, at the moment that he reveals
to
him his displeasure in their current surroundings.  This is almost a last
supper reversal, where Jesus let Judas sip from his cup before the
betrayal&#133;interesting.  Then of course the Oracle herself gives Neo a
cookie,
so that he will feel better.  Cakes and Cups prevail throughout.  They are
even given what could pass for 'Manna' to eat.  The Hebrew for Manna
literally means, &quot;what is it?&quot;  This surely fits the gruel that they ate in
their bowls.<br /><br />What else, the scene in the elevator is right out of Speed, one of Keanu's
best.<br /><br />The submarine scene with them all sitting quiet, like 'Run Silent, Run
Deep'.  It is a sub marine classic to park the sub, go quiet, and then wait
out the depth charges with sweat running down your faces.<br /><br />The scene where Keanu loses his mouth was taken directly from the science
fiction classic &quot;I have no mouth, yet I must scream&quot; by Harlan Ellison.  It
also reminded me of the cover of an old HP Lovecraft book I once
owned.<br /><br />The device that they used to suck the bug out of Keanu's stomach was this
giant intricate machine, yet powered by plugging in to the cigarette
lighter
hole in the dash of the car.  The car that they chose were these
Kennedy-presidency-era limo Lincolns (with tops), always
black.<br /><br />Finally, for now, the fact that the only escape were these forgotten hard
copper phone lines by Bell or whichever phone company.  The last vestige of
the escape was actually low tech and hundreds of years old by then...no
cell
phone could save them.
