I have just finished watching this movie for the tenth time and I still love
it.I just had to write another comment about it because this is one fab
movie. First where did they get the ideas for this movie from? Absoloute
intellegence. The cast was wonderful, all played the parts fantastically.Man
I wish I could've played the part of Trinity! I especially loved Keanu
Reeves ( I wish he was younger! Isn't It hard to believe he will be 36 this
year!) Great music. Extremly intellegent story line.
You could never remember all the lines to this movie and it continues to
amuse you.People you have to watch this movie.It is the absoloute best.I
can't wait for The Matrix 2.
 From MONIQUE<br /><br />P.S: Email me if you know of any other terrific movies Keanu is in that I
would enjoy! <br /><br /> KEANU REEVES FOREVER PEOPLE! HE IS ONE BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY
GUY!
