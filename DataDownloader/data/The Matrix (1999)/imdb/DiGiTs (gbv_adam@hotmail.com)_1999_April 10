1999_April 10 

I'm amazed that I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I didn't really care
for the Wachowski brothers' last film, Bound (but to be fair, it seems
that
everyone else loved it), and I'm not a massive Keanu fan, but together
they've managed to put together one of the most entertaining films I've
seen
this year. The action scenes are in a class all of their own (John Woo
should take notes... none of his American films have been nearly this well
done). Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne deliver excellent
performances, and Keanu isn't half bad himself... all the martial-arts
training they took before filming really shows. After the first scene
ended
(which is absolutely breathtaking), the theater I watched The Matrix in
erupted into spontaneous applause. And Hugo Weaving is perfectly cast as
the
genuinely creepy antagonist.
