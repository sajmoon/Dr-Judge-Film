The Matrix is just another sci-fi film that offers nothing special to the
genre. The only reason everybody dropped their jaws and praised this film
was because of the great special effects and fight scenes. Believe me
there
is a lot more to a film than just it's special effects.<br /><br />The script was mind numbing at times, especially with the whole &quot;We're not
in Kansas anymore&quot; bull crap line, and the acting was just a notch above
awful. The only person that even resembled an actor was Laurence
Fishburne.
Keanu Reeves is his usual self.<br /><br />All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even
worse.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick go out and get &quot;Planet of the
Apes&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, or any one of the Star Wars films. If you are
looking for a good 90's sci-fi flick go get 12 Monkeys cause that has a
lot
more than this, like a script and a plot that is more than paper
thin.
