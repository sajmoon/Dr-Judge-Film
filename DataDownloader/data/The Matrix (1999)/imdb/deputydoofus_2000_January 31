This isn't one of the greatest Si-Fi movies ever made, but it was the best
one of '99.  The story takes so many turns that it's easy to enjoy and think
about.  However, it saddens me when the obligatory violent scene is the
scene the audience appears to like most.  The scene, for me, didn't need to
be there, as it goes against the characters' morality.<br /><br />Overall, it's good for a few thrills, but there's nothing in it that other
movies haven't done better.  If you liked the violence and anarchic ideas in
the Matrix, see Fight Club.  If you liked the mysterious world and gradually
revealing plotline, see Dark City.  If you liked the films overall style,
see Bound (The Wachowski Brothers' first movie).  Each one of those films
serves it's particular purpose much more effectively than The Matrix.  The
Matrix does combine the three elements in a cohesive way, and does produce
one heck of a thrill, so it offers something few other movies can give.  See
it, and, if you like it, see the other ones I've mentioned, you'll find they
have a lot to offer as well.  My rating: 8/10<br /><br />
