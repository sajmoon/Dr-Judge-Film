1999_May 8 

Though I am typically unimpressed by any work generated by Keanu Reeves,
this film really surprised me.  Of course, outstanding special effects and
a
noteworthy story line can't really hurt.  This was an &quot;excellent&quot;
(insert Keanu's surfer-boy accent here)film and I am eagerly
looking forward to the Wachowski's next endeavor.
