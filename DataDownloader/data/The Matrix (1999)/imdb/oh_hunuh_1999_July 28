1999_July 28 

I was troubled the other day because I realized, that I haven't seen a good
film in a long, long, time. Then I saw The Matrix. It got my blood pumping,
and I was jumping out of my seat and clapping, talking to the people on the
screen,(&quot;He's around the corner&quot;,&quot;Watch Out!&quot;) and I actually cared about
the characters! So here is a little message for all the directors in the
world, if you can make more films like that, I think the movie-going
audience would grow!
