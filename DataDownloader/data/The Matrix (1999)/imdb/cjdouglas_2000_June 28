in one word i can describe this movie: AWESOME!
loved the story line, the music and the concept was great! Keanu did a
great
job, Laurence was superb. special effects - unbelievable! I would give
this
movie a solid two thumbs up! I normally don't think much of Keanu's acting
ability, but he was perfect for this role as Neo. A great movie all
around!
