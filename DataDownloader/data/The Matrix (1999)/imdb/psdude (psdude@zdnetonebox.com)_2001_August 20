If I had to define The Matrix in one word, it would be: AWESOME. The movie
is all about a man named Neo Anderson, who just happens to be a computer
hacker. Neo stumbles upon a man named Morpheous, who agrees to show Neo the
REAL world. Explaining the plot outline of The Matrix in text is kind of
difficult. So, unfortunately, it is the kind of movie you have to watch
over
and over to completely understand the story. Even if you don't understand
it, the special effects and sound are worth getting this movie alone! Do
yourself a favor and go see this movie!
