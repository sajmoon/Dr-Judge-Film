1999_May 5 

I must say I'm a sucker for movies that make you think. The idea that one
is
not in control of one's life may be a little over-used, but nevertheless,
this movie gives you the visual details you need.<br /><br />I must say though some of the jokes were cheesy (humans being made into
Duracell batteries for one), which produces several points of anti-climax,
it's not bad enough to make you not like it. The kung-fu was one thing
that
really kicked ass. First time I must say where kung-fu is used well. Also
incredibly imaginative at times in terms of the special effects (I mean,
I've never seen anything like this!). The fast dodging of bullets etc etc.
Though I must say the sound tended to be too loud at times for my
pleasure.<br /><br />I love the scene where Trinity finished off the Agent .. I mean, yeah,
girls, this is one woman to look up to! However, I must say the movie
didn't
explain how the hell the little system which the aliens destroyed
recovered
and how Neo managed to get back to the Matrix after that destruction and
what happened to Morpheus. I hope this is not a ploy to do a
sequel.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, let's just say, I felt as though I was in The
Matrix. Let's face it, reality sucks without split-split-second
kung-fu...
