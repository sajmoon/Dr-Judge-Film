A Virtual Reality Thrill Ride. This is a rare breed
of film, taking in the fact that it is yet another
sci-fi thriller. We see morals, life and death
flash before us. We see a possible future of cyber
fascination taken one step beyond, and reality is
left only for those who have charisma enough to fight.
This will be a classic for the future - Oh wait the future
is already here !
