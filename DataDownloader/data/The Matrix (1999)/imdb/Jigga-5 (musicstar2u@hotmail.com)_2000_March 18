This was one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen! I mean the
storyline and plot was really complicated but the special effects were
awesome.  It had action from beginning to end.  It also had everything in
it.  It had love, some parts were funny, action, and violence.  And that is
what makes a movie great.  I cannot wait until part 2 comes out.
