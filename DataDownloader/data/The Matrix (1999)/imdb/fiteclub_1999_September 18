It boils down to this:  this movie is COOL!  You feel like a little kid
watching this movie, watching your favorite comic book come to life.  With
whizzing sound effects and rapid action, kids to adults were entranced by
this epic that somehow managed to come in under the radar.  Some people cite
it as a guy flick, but I have seen this with a number of females, and they
liked it just as much as me.  Some people complain that it's too confusing. 
Fine, so be it.  I'm sure my 7 year old brother didn't understand it, yet he
loved it.  Why?  Because you can just sit back and let the movie take you
in.  The dialogue and graphics and general feel.  You just wanna go. 
&quot;Whoa.&quot;
