Last year, it was &quot;Dark City&quot; that was hailed for it's visual achievement.
And though that film amazed me when I saw it, I find &quot;The Matrix&quot; to be even
more astounding and visually stunning. The first thing that amazed me about
the film was Keanu Reeves' performance. He is very good in this role, and
doesn't show a bit of bad acting. The first-rate special effects leave your
jaw dropping constantly, particularly the scenes where bullets are being
dodged. It's a brilliant entertainment that should be seen more than
once.
