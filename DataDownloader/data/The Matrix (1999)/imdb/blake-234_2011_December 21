The Matrix, some may say the most profound science fiction film in
history, we have all seen The Matrix&#x85; I assume, so we all know how
amazing it is and how it can leave you one edge of your seat, with its
outstanding cast and ground-breaking visual effects. This film is in my
all-time favorite films because of it being so superlative and well
basically, entertaining and extraordinary. So for the repulsive,
cretins that have not seen this fantastic film, I&#x27;ll give them a
briefing of what it&#x27;s about.<br /><br />The Matrix starts off with an action-packed scene that leaves us
scratching our heads, on what the movie is supposed to be about, but it
gradually all comes together. The star of this film is Keanu Reeves,
who plays an estranged lost worker in New York, Thomas Anderson, but
goes by the online alias Neo, this is all &#x27;supposably&#x27; set in the year
1999. Look I won&#x27;t give too much away but I will tell you this; Neo
thinks that something has always been &#x27;different&#x27; in the world but he
can&#x27;t explain it, we soon find out the truth about this world and
discover what the true reality is.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne is great in this acting as the all-wise Morpheus, in
his comeback performance, alongside some brilliant co-stars such as the
Subtle and intimidating Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving, Carrie
Anne-Moss as the prevailing Trinity, Joe Pantoliano as bad guy Cipher,
who you may remember as &#x27;Guido The Killer Pimp&#x27; in Risky Business.<br /><br />Concluding my review I would like to say that if you watch this film
and thoroughly enjoy it, do not, and I repeat do not, watch the sequels
to this film, for it will ruin your experience of the original.
Nevertheless I give The Matrix 10/10 B-Train Stars. Classic.
