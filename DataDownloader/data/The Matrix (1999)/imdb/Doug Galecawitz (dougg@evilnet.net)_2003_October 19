i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The
story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of
anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought
to
a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and
allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life
cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies,
artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and
euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci
fi
need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or
reason.
The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters
not
know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they
are
met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or
waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and
worshipped like Star Wars
