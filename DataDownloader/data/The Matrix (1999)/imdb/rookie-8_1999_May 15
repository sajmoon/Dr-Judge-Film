1999_May 15 

I am not, what you would call, a big Keanu Reeves fan, but this movie was
excellent. The story line was wonderfully original, taking the Terminator
plot line to new levels, and the acting was terrific. Reeves did a great
job
as the confused NEO who is thrown into this world unsuspecting of anything
to come, and his end fight with the Agent Smith is one of the only times I
ever believed Reeves could be a &quot;hard a%%&quot;. The actor who played Agent
Smith
was a great villian and the actress who played Trinity did an outstanding
job. Though the story can be confusing at times, and the constant
references
to what is real and what is not can spin your head, the movie makes up for
it with amazing action sequences and some of the best effects I have seen
in
year. Overall, this should be a must see for any avid movie goer.
