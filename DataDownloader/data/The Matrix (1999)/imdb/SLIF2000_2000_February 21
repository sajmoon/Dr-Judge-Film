The Matrix is the best movie ever made.  This movie is so perfect in every
way, the story is original and clever, the action, stunts and effects are
the best you'll ever see.  The movie starts off with Carrie Ann Moss in
this
room surrounded by police and then in 10 seconds all the police are dead
and
she's not even harmed, and all the audience are thinking wow!.  After that
the film starts explaining what happens for about an hour which it does
need
because there is a lot to explain, but there are good action scenes in the
middle like a training kung fu fight between Keanu Reeves and Laurence
Fishbourne.  The last half hour of the movie is my favourite part of any
movie ever the action does not stop the whole way through, it starts off
with Laurence Fishbourne being captured by Hugo Weaving the main bady
agent
who are trying to kill the goodies (Reeves, Fishbourne, Moss etc), Reeves
and Moss try to rescue Fishbourne from these nearly invincible agents. If
you haven't seen this film you are really missing out on something, just
make sure you concentrate or you will get confused.  My rating is 10 out
of
10.
