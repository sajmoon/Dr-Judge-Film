1999_May 14 

So I must say I was shocked.
I don't think I am too much of an easy guy to impress. I usually am very
critical about movies, I've read a bunch of SciFi novels (from Asimov to
Gibson through P.K.Dick ...).
But this movie got me really shocked.
At the end of it I had to stay sit for a while and thing about it, and
most
probably I'll go back to see it in the next days.
I don't want to say the film is perfect, no way (anyway what does perfect
means) but it's very well done, it's a great synthesis of both sci-fi
state
of the art, movie special effects, and oneiric view of reality. Well acted
(no doubt about Keanu and Fishburne).
So that's all. Maybe after I've seen it another time I will post some
more.
