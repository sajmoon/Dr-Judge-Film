Do you like sci-fi? Action? Comic books? Amazing special effects? A rock
solid plot? Well then folk, welcome to the Matrix. This movie was one of
the
most innovative films in a long time and it was a great deal of fun to
watch. Surprisingly, thanks to his lack of major dialogue, Keanu Reeves was
quite good in this flick! And sweet goodness, those designs by Geof Darrow
were amazing. All in all, see this movie. You'll be glad you did. Just
ignore the ending. Flying? What the hell?
