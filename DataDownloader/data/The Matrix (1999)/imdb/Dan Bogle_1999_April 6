The Matrix :
1 Part Dark City
2 Parts (place Hong Kong action movie here)
1 Part Terminator
Mix well.<br /><br />This movie was such a pleasant surprise.  The trailer did a really good job
of not giving away ANYTHING about the movie, which is why I was really
skeptical about seeing it... it looked like a bunch of random fight scenes
with some f/x thrown in.  But it was really cool, even though the plot was
very inspired.  It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again
and notice new stuff each time.  Definitely a must-see (and must-buy when it
comes out on DVD, which it will, since it's a WB movie)....<br /><br />
