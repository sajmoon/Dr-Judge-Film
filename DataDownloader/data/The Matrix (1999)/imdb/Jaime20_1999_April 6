1999_April 6 

I'm normally not a big sci-fi fan.  In fact, I just went to see this for
the
special effects.  But the plot was so well-constructed, I couldn't really
think of any major holes anywhere in the movie.  And the effects were
everything I'd hope they would be and more.  They didn't go overboard, it
was an even balance of clever writing and incredible
film-making.
