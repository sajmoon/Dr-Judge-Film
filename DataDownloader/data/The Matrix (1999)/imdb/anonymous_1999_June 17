1999_June 17 

This movie is the biggest step forward in Hollywood action movies in
recent
memory.  The fight scenes were the best I've ever seen in an American
movie.
Hopefully the bar has been raised enough that other film makers will be
held to this new standard.<br /><br />The movie also had good special effects and an interesting premise.  The
acting wasn't great, but why should we even pretend to be disappointed?
We
all know Keanu isn't great.  Give him credit for taking such a physically
demanding part.
