2000_December 24 

Sure, sure, sure, read all the other comments for the good part of the
movie. I'll hit the bad point, guns were not that good, they disposed it
easily, bullet smoke had stringy graphics, spiral. 
And the beginning is so boring, most of the action came in the last 25
minutes. One of the top 10 of the century, I think not. It does not deserve
this position, sure the stunts were good, just look at the amout of fighting
it had, 25 minutes? So much time was wasted on talking, Agent Smith got a
lot of fighting, the big agent got 1 scene, should give more to these
actors, and the other one, the thinnest of them got nothing to do!!!!
Common!! That's rather slack to actors, and producers, millions of bucks for
wearing glasses and no stunts. <br /><br />Good stuff was the stunts of Trininty and Neo, Trininty and the big agent
were my favorite. Special effects of everything except bullet smoke was
good, fighting was good, story was good. The whole movie was good except for
the fact of the boredom viewers recieve for everything except for the last
25 mins of the show. I hope Matrix 2 turns out more action less talk.
