&#x22;A Virtual Science Fiction that went on the world like a hurricane
effect&#x22; - this publication on a magazine made me to see The Matrix as
soon as possible.<br /><br />After I seen the movie i was fascinated. It made me too see it again in
a row in about 3 times.It is really a bounder-breaking picture.<br /><br />We can be amazed for the first time by the bullet time and time
freezing techniques, it is really great to see the camera rolling in
360 degrees and to view the same picture.<br /><br />The Matrix is played in the future where the machines are ruling the
world. They are using mankind for an energy source and using &#x22;The
Matrix&#x22; program too make believe the human mind that the body is really
living.The mankind is almost eliminated ,it is remained only a city
&#x22;Zion&#x22; .From this city a rebellion ship named the Nebuchadnezzar and
it&#x27;s team free a mind from The Matrix who later will be the one.<br /><br />He&#x27;s name is Neo and he will be the one and on he&#x27;s hand will depend
the freedom of mankind.<br /><br />The Matrix has been awarded with 4 Oscars in 2000 :Best Sound ;Best
Editing ;Best Effects,Sound Effects Editing ;Best Effects,Visual
Effects .<br /><br />In other matters it is a great philosophical movie with other big
questions like where does mankind hading ,or the origin of humanity.<br /><br />This title is also a warning that if we are not careful machines one
day may take out the control.<br /><br />After all these years it is still a &#x22;huriccane&#x22; movie what inspired a
lot of upcoming titles whit it&#x27;s superb effects.<br /><br />It is a total piece of greatness a must see in all meaning
