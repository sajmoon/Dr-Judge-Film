The first time I saw this movie, I was amazed! The second time I saw it,
I
was in awe! The third time I saw it...I had to see it again!
I'm serious, this is my favorite movie EVER! It has everything: Action,
Adventure, Suspense, Romance, Sci-Fi, even a little humor! If you've never
seen this, you should! I give it a 10 1/2!
You'll walk away feeling like you have to see it again. Definately. Take
my advice, the special effects alone are worth it...but it also has an
excellent, mind-blowing script!
I hope you decide to watch this movie soon, it's the
best!
