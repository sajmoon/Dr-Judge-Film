As far as the genre is considered this is the all time single most
beautiful
piece of Art ever captured on film. The acting I wouldn't consider to be
the greatest of our time but the vibe and the overall message was by far
the
most wonderful visual feast I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. What
a
brilliant movie by The W Bros. these guys kick serious !@!@#@$! Also a
must
see is the movie &quot;Bound&quot; if you like anything by The W
Bros.
