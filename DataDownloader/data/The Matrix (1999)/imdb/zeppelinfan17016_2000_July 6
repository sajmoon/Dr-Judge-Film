The Matrix has got to be the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie that I've seen in a
long time. The special effects are the greatest, the acting is very good,
and the props? Well, I want Morpheus' sunglasses and that cell phone
(which
I heard they're actually making). The ju-jitzu and kung-fu is awesome! The
soundtrack is pretty damn good, too! The only thing is that Keanu Reeves
isn't the greatest actor in the world (but, then who is?). I have to
admit,
though, his acting in The Matrix was ok. I have one question, though. How
did Cypher get into the Matrix to talk to the agent without anyone
noticing?
Well, if I knew then the movie wouldn't be so great, right?
