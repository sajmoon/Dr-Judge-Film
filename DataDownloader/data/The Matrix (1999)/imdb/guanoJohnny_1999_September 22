1999_September 22 

Early on, Agent Smith does a superb Blues Brothers Dan Aykroyd imitation,
as
he  threatens Our Hero by intoning these immortal lines, &quot;It seems that
you've been living ... two lives. One life, you're Thomas A. Anderson,
program writer for a RESPECTABLE SOFTWARE COMPANY. You have a social
security number, pay your taxes, and you ... help your landlady CARRY OUT
HER GARBAGE.&quot;<br /><br />Imagine Dan drawing out the looong pronunciations in the capitalized
words.
And now Agent Smith steals the show by cracking his knuckles! Now he
cracks
his neck bones! Fear This, Keanu!<br /><br />Later, the Trench Coat Mafia enjoys a vicarious Columbine carnage-fest as
we
are splashed with waves of hot ejected shell casings! Ahhh! More shell
casings, please!! What great cinema!! Fill the screen with flying bullets
and spent shell casings, oh! Yessss!!!!! Uhnnnnn, OH!!
AhhhhhHH!!<br /><br />At the very least, The Matrix is a much better film than Cannibal
Holocaust,
which I saw for the first time earlier in the day. Achh, the mechanical
attack squids are breaking into my computer again!! /%$@# achh!!!
$#CRASH!!
*&amp;$^#@!!!!
