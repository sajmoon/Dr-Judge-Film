1999_April 5 

I saw this movie on opening weekend - the crowds were out the door. Between
the Keanu fans and the fans of the &quot;weird sci-fi&quot; genre... the showing was
packed.
I at first expected another &quot;Johnny Neumonic&quot; but what I saw was a mature
Keanu that has finally found his niche.
The movie is well written and the main plot unfolds to explore all the
subplots in the story. The audenice was captivated at the writers ability to
incorporate humor, emotion and pure mechanoid behaviour without making it
too techno.
This has got to be the best movie to incorporate new-age special effects...trust me, it makes you go oooh and aahhh!!. The contrast between L.
Fishburne and Keanu was well thought out and the &quot;real&quot; fight scenes are
impressive. As the viewer in front of me said &quot; He could out fight Jackie
Chan with those moves&quot;.
I would not recommend this movie to those who suffer epileptic fits or those
who prefer to be trippy while watching sci-fi...the quick movemnts in these
fight scenes make both your eyes and your stomach jump.
I would definitely go see it again.
