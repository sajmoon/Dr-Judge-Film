Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo in his cyber-hecker
world.
He receives various messages from the cyber-criminals, Trinity and
Morpheous. After being chased down by the Agent Smith's, he gets bugged
and
winds up with Trinity. He is then introduced to the world as it is and
seen
as a possible savior. The movie has it's flaws but is made up by great
action and special effects. Carrie Anne-Moss is baberiffic as Trinity. The
movie throws alot of religious symbolism in the story. If you like
kungu-fu
and cool action, check this movie out. Not the greatest movie of 1999 but
certainly one of the most visually breathtaking. This movie gets better
with
each viewing. I expected a whole different movie opposed to what I saw in
the theater, but never the less I gave it a second chance and I'm glad I
did. Check this out on DVD. The end sequence is excellent. ***1/2 out of
****
