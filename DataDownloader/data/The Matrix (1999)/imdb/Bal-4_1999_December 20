For those of you who think that the story line for The Matrix is totally
original, then allow me to enlighten you. The script is a 'wrapped up'
version of Buddhist philosophy.<br /><br />In Buddhist philosophy, the world as we perceive it through our senses is
merely an illusion. Nothing really exists as we perceive things to be. This
is synonymous to 'The Matrix'. Neo who is 'The One' is synonymous to the The
Buddha who has discovered the way to see things as they really are.<br /><br />'The Truth' is the truth of seeing things as they really are. 'The Training'
is Vipassana or Insight Meditation whereby the mind is concentrated and
trained to penetrate reality into its constituent components. 'The One',
comes into his own when he experiences the constituents. That is when Neo
sees the reality behind the facade.<br /><br />The scary thing is that we are living in a 'Matrix' (samsara). It is not in
the future but has been with us since the dawn of time. However, there is
light at the end of the tunnel as there is a way out.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a good film.
