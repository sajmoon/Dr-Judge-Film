Two things went through my mind as I watched this film (which I have
seen thrice, and would happily see it again). One: This is a quality
science fiction story. Two: Will the style and violence overwhelm the
story? - as too often occurs with potentially great sci-fi films
inevitably by way of cheap scriptwriting. It is the nature of
blockbuster type Hollywood films to screw up a good sci-fi thing by
allowing the action to prioritize-to-death the story. As one might
expect from an action film featuring Keanu Reeves, the dialogue tends
toward the short-witted and stylish and there is plenty of gratuitous
violence. But Hollywood has recently been on to this valid criticism of
itself, and it appears to have been making some progress in this area.<br /><br />Matrix is an example of producers with an ear to those of us who want
more than just ignorant dialogue and fast, violent action from our
science fiction films. On one hand, they have basically a stylized
kung-fu flick with an African-American heavily supporting a white lead,
lots of black leather and overcoats, guns, action, state-of-the-art
effects, futuristic &quot;space&quot;ships etc. On the other, they have a sci-fi
story that at first sounds typical but then unfolds into a well crafted
tour of a potential futuristic human existence visualized through the
context of what currently stands as cutting edge technology (virtual
reality). This makes the idea &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, as in Arthur
Clarke's Odyssey novels/films which used NASA technology as their
premise. There is also a biblical slant to the plot and names of
characters and props.<br /><br />If I was to be picky, I might say that less gratuitous violence in
exchange for more plot discerning dialogue would have improved the
film. It would have made it more like a sci-fi book. But maybe I should
just go and read the book for that (most blockbuster films nowadays
have a book released along with them - Star Wars has several). Anyway,
I hope there is a good book made from this story, because I would read
it as avidly as any favorite sci-fi novel: the plot idea is that good. <br /><br />Incidentally, the sequels to this film, typically are trash in
comparison to the original. Very much disappointed, I had to realize
that the producers/director were far more involved in the stylization
and special effects than the plot. Too bad.<br /><br />On the other hand, finding time to read books is becoming increasingly
difficult these days, which says a lot in relation to the moral within
Matrix. Which leads us to the duality present in a moral film such as
Matrix: Should we watch it again and forget about the world's problems,
or think twice and do something to improve our society, to increase our
independence and freedom? In the end, we may be victims of our own
device, for we seek entertainment to help us forget about the drudgery
of our lives. Our man-made systems, systems that were originally
created to enhance independence from menial labor, may be creating a
new form of slavery.<br /><br />It's a creepy thought. But maybe it's just fantasy. Maybe Matrix is
just an entertaining movie. Despite its inherent short-witted
weaknesses, its clich&eacute;d fashion statements, I was thoroughly
entertained. It says something about me and the kind of viewers that
like this stuff. We are dreamers more than we are fixers and doers. Our
detractors, the fixers and doers who come out on this forum to
criticize us, are probably right that we should be spending more of our
time servicing our society. But then, that wouldn't be freedom for us,
would it?
