1999_September 30 

This movie is great!! I mean it.  It's more than what you expect from a
futuristic movie, I'm not really a futuristic fan but I really enjoyed
this
film, it has very intense dialogues, and amazing martial arts, action,
sequences.  So no matter if you are into futuristic stuff or you're not go
and rent it, by the way it is the #1 in DVD sales overpowering TITANIC by
68,000 copies the first week. It's a 10/10
