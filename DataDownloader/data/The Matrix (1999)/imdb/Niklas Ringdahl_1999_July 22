1999_July 22 

As one of the movies that suffered most from the suffocating PR from the
makers of &quot;the phantom menace&quot;, &quot;the Matrix&quot; wipes the competition clean.
On
the opposite of Mr Lucas, the makers of &quot;the Matrix&quot; succeeds in making a
high tech future-vision that, in its obscureness, seems plausible. With
very
little publicity, it really got to me as fresh, new and smart, through all
the computers and cyberpunk. It kept surprising me, and it grew on me for
an
hour after it was over.
Seen it, loved it, bought the OST, recommending it.<br /><br />
