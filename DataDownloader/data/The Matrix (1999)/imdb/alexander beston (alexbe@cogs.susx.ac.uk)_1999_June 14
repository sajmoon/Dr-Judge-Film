The Matrix is a 'good' action / sci-fi thriller though it is let down by
the
psuedo-philosophical-self-important script with laughable self agrandising
and dignifying comments - 'nobody can know the path you have to ...' &amp;
'you
are the one'. I had the feeling a boy had read some philosophy primer and
decided to make some actors reel off this funny script. It was so silly
after a while and spoiled an excellent action movie - stick to action
talk!
