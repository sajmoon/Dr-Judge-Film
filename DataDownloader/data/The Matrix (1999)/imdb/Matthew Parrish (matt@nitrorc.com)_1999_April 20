1999_April 20 

What first appeared to be a &quot;I'll wait till it comes out on video&quot; turned
out to be the best sci-fi action flik since Terminator 2.. bar none.  The
trailers simply don't do it justice.  Perhaps enhancing the trailers would
have given the storyline away so I can see where they were coming from.
This is definitely a word of mouth film.<br /><br />This movie immerses you into a plot that would otherwise be hard to
swallow,
even with an open mind.  The screenplay is simply brilliant, and the
special
effects, well, it's just never been done before.<br /><br />With it's techno-pop soundtrack, intense action and cool shades you can't
miss with this one.  See it on the big screen before it's too
late!<br /><br />
