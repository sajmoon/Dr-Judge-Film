1999_April 25 

Many people loved the MATRIX, but I thought it was just alright, nothing
terrible but the special effects were awsome, they totally made the movie
come together, also Keanu Reeves was good, and so was Laurence Fishburne..
If I was the director I would have given the part of Neo to someone like
Nicolas Cage, but Keanu did good..<br /><br />Overall: If you like sci fi, this film's for you..
