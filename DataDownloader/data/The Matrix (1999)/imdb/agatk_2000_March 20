Superlative special effects, non-stop action, but no real plot, a total
disregard for scientific realities, and lots of simplistic &quot;philosophy.&quot;
Great eye candy and no substance combine to give an average film overall.
A
good movie to see when you just want to be entertained, without having to
think too deeply.
