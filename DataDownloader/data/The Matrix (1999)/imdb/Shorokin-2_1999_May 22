1999_May 22 

This is what sci-fi movies of the future should be like. Lots of
eye-candy,
style and deep thinking. It appeals across many levels of movie goers. All
of the acting was great, especially the four main characters. Yes, even
Keanu. I have never seen anyone do an impersonation of Bruce Lee so well,
even down to the tiny mannerisms. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss
were brilliant and oh so stylish. Big kudos to the costume designers. The
Matrix is well-thought out, perfectly executed and intricately detailed.
See
it more than once to get the full effect. It's my current best movie ever
and I hope it wins an award for special effects, or even just coolness
:)
