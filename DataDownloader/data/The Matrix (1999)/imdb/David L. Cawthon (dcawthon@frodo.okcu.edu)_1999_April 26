1999_April 26 

When my friend and I entered the theatre, we raised the average age by at
least 20 years. We are over 60, you see.  Of course, the kids loved the
flick. It was loud and violent, yet full of the most advanced special
effects around. As my friend observed, &quot;It was candy for the
senses!&quot;<br /><br />But he liked it better than I did. Albeit, the plot was surreal. (We always
knew that reality was an illusion.) But MATRIX presented details regarding
the cosmos and its ontological implications in a much different manner.
Humans are mere crops being fertilized by machines who have evolved as our
superiors.<br /><br />My friend gives the movie an 8/10 for style, creativity, and sensual
intensity. I looked forward to going home and listening to soft, soothing
music. If MATRIX is candy for the senses, I must be a diabetic. To me the
dark and stark violence was more invasive than satisfying.<br /><br />But, what the hell! That's why we have two thumbs.<br /><br />
