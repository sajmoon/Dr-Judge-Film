1999_October 20 

Nothing but a bunch of hitting, and computerized effects that leave you
cold.  No real plot to follow, nothing interesting to keep you watching. <br /><br />I really think most people see what they want to see, when they saw this
movie, judging from the reviews I've read (incredibly over-analyzed).  It's
one of those movies which is a mish-mash of everything, but ends up being
NOTHING.  I forgot about the movie the minute it was over.<br /><br />Johnny Neumonic was much MUCH better, as simple and badly acted as it was. 
The Matrix, however, is just more of Hollywood churning out high-brow
special effect action movies---without any substance to them at all!.  It's
irritating....and a shame!
