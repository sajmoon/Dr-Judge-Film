This movie features a great story that shows how great Sci-Fi films can be. 
While it is true that the plot is mainly an excuse to show neat looking
visuals of people dodging bullets followed by lines like &quot;You are the chosen
one&quot;, the story still is very engaging and bold.  The cinematography is also
excellent and impressive.  While not among the greatest films ever, this is
one of the best, if not the best Sci-fi film to come along in a few
years.
