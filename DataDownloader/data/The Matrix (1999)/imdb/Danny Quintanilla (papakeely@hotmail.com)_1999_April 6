1999_April 6 

This movie had everything, it had gun fights, kick-a** kung fu scenes,
great
special effects, and everything else you would want in a action flick and
sci-fi movies. The previews were perfect because they enticed you enough
to
see it without giving away anything. I recommend that anyone who likes
action or sci-fi or even just weird movies, this is the one for
everyone.
