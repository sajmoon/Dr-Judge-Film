1999_April 4 

At several points during the film, I found myself thinking, &quot;hey, this isn't
so bad&quot;, but then I realized that I was getting suckered by the special
effects and martial arts scenes.<br /><br />This movie is pretty average, with potential to be great, had it not ripped
off of every other sci-fi movie there is. It's a great way to entertain
yourself, trying to find all the other movies within the movie. For example,
the idea of human resistance to the machines? Thank you 'Terminator'. There
are also shades of Star Wars, Fire in the Sky, Dark City, Hackers... The
list goes on and on.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves gives a typically wooden performance, but it's really just an
action movie, so it's excusable. Laurence Fishburne excels in a sadly
cliched role as Morpheus, who is essentially Yoda on Pentium.<br /><br />Basically, it's a matter of how you choose to take it. If it's just
gratuitous special effects, and comic book-like plotlines, then it's very
well done. However, in terms of originality, there is something sorely
lacking. This is not a cerebral flick, so don't analyze too much or you'll
hate it.
