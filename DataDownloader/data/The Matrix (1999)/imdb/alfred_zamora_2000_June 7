2000_June 7 

To tell the truth, I went into this movie expecting to come out totally
confused, but instead I came out asking questions that I think i will never
be able to answer.
Next to John Woo, the Wachowski's are the best directors I have ever seen.
They way they film action sequences is spectacular and was worth the Oscar
they won.
The plot also, will raise some eyebrows and cause a lot of questions to be
asked.
My favorite character in the film would have to be the evil Agent Smith he
is both slimy and mysterious at the same time.
I have to say this film set the standard in directing for action/sci-fi
movies.
I give it 10/10 and anxiously wait for the sequels.
