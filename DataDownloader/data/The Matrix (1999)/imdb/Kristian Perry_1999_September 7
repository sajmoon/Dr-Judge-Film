The Matrix is the most entertaining film I've ever seen.  The action and
special effects are without rival.  But, in addition, the plot of the film
and the philosophical issues raised are extremely interesting and well
done.
In short, this film is very nutritious - lots of eye-candy, but with
equal
servings of character and story.  Unreserved 2 thumbs up.
