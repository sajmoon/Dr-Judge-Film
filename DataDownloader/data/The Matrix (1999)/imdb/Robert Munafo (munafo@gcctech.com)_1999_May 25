1999_May 25 

My rating: 8 out of 10.<br /><br />I admire this movie for introducing millions to an idea that I have
explored
extensively for over 20 years: That everyone's mind might be hooked up to
some type of virtual reality system and therefore, maybe, nothing is
&quot;real&quot;.
Since I was so familiar with this premise, nothing that happened in the
movie took me by surprise and I found myself wishing its many crucial plot
devices were consistently plausible.<br /><br />For the sake of entertainment and a dramatic, unpredictable storyline, the
Wachowskis decided to give all the characters (both good and bad) many
simple physical limitations that they really wouldn't have in a real
&quot;matrix&quot;. That's all I'll say, I don't want to give too much away, but
after
you've seen the film use your imagination and you'll see what I
mean.<br /><br />The physical limitations and other technical flaws are all set up to
create
an instability and balance of power that allows for plenty of suspense,
drama and what my friends call &quot;excessive gratuitous violence&quot; in the
lengthy combat scenes that showcase the film's groundbreaking (for 1999)
special effects.<br /><br />So, if you're seriously interested in the premise of the movie (and we all
should be, as it plays a very real and central role in Humanity's future)
and the lessons it has to teach, just remember that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is first
and foremost designed as entertainment. Its &quot;lessons&quot; are but a few basic
ideas which you will need to explore on your own elsewhere.<br /><br />Why, after all this, do I still rate it 8/10? Because The Matrix is d**n
good entertainment, for anyone who enjoys gratuitous violence and dark
science fiction, and it has gotten an important message out to many
people.
