2000_March 22 

I went into the theater not knowing what to expect.  I left the theater
thinking about nothing but the movie.  I haven't been that impressed with a
film in far too long.  Most action films have to be given a bit of...what
is
it called...suspension of disbelief, in order to be enjoyable.  This film
snatched my mental portion of suspended disbelief and took me for quite a
ride.  The simple betrayal and &quot;saved by a woman's love&quot; cliches aside, it
was as near-perfect a thing as I've seen on screen in way too long.
