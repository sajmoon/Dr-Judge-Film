My favorite indeed.  This movie has it all; and the acting is just as good
as the mind-blowing special effects.  The cast is great; Lawrence Fishburne
is awesome as well as Catie-Ann Moss.  No one can play Neo better than Keanu
Reeves.  A instant masterpiece, a cult classic.  BEST movie of the 90's
definitely. 10/10
