&quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.
You have to see it for yourself.&quot;. It is a visual experience. The only thing
I can say is that The Matrix is the fiction of the 21st Century, an
extremely original cybernetic adventure that concerns a real world and a
virtual world, the human kind and the artificial intelligence. A motion
picture with astonishing visual effects that transport us to a dream world,
a world where anything is possible. Do you still want to know what the
Matrix is? &quot;The answer is out there (...) and it's looking for you, and it
will find you if you want it to.&quot;. And believe,  you will. &quot;It's the
question that drives us.&quot; So, what are you waiting for? Go and watch this
movie. &quot;What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.&quot;<br /><br />End of transmission....
