I have used The Matrix in my high school courses of Philosophy. The task
for
the students is to watch The Matrix and after that, as groups of four,
give
a lesson to the other students about some philosophical theory/philosopher
and its connections to the movie.<br /><br />The philosophical themes are:
Socrates (Morfeus as the person who leads to the search for the truth in
The
Matrix)
Plato's idealism ja The State (Matrix is a modern version of the
cave-metaphor)
Utilitarism  (the pleasant life in the matrix was not a good life, it is
better to live - even with pain - in the real world. Only Cypher chose the
pleasure)
Immanuel Kant (epistemology and morals: even after leaving the Matrix Neo
had to live in his own phenomenal world; Neo did his duty trying to save
other people, the thinking about the consequences)
Epistemology, Empirism ja Rationalism (How much could you rely on your
senses in the Matrix; for example when sensing himself jumping from a
rooftop, Neo used his rationality and knew it is not real)<br /><br />Descartes (The method of systematic skepticism comes quite obvious:. What
can we know for sure?)<br /><br />After the course it seemed that the students (16 years old) were able to
look at the Matrix in a new way, seeing many aspects they did not see
before. Also the philosophical themes became useful and more easy to
understand. With the help of a movie like this, philosophy can make its
way
out of the classroom, to become a part of real life, which I find
important.<br /><br />Juha Eerolainen
