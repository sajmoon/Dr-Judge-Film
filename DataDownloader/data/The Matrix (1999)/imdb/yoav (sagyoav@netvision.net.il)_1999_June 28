1999_June 28 

First of all, i want to say that this movie is one of the best movie's
ever
made in almost every aspect. but instead of describing how great it is. i
want to point 3 thing that lacked in this movie.
1. the audience was never told why neo started wondering about the matrix
and why did he want to find the answer to the question: what is the
matrix?
what made him find out about the existence of the matrix?
2. i wish that the character of trinity had more aspects then just the
romantical aspect in this movie. i wish that her character was more
developed.
3. i wish that the audience would know more about the oracle character.
again, i wish that this character was more developed.<br /><br />other than those 3, i think this movie is (almost) perfect.
