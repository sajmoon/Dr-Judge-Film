&quot;Are we really sure of the reality we live in?&quot; An interesting question
which &quot;The Matrix&quot; sets out to explore. Unfortunately the film is let down
by poor acting, a lack of tension and an absolutely woeful script
consisting
primarily of rather nonsensical pseudo-science.<br /><br />What really disappointed me about &quot;The Matrix&quot; was that it had the
potential
to be a good film. The overall concept was interesting enough to pull it
above the average sci-fi plot and at the start there is some tense action
when the audience is left in suspense as to who is on who's side and
whether
everyone is actually human, vaguely reminiscent of the earlier &quot;X-files&quot;
series. However, after the first twenty minutes or so the film completely
loses direction. The suspense is lost entirely, since from that point on
there is never any doubt where the film is going. The plot also loses all
credibility by trying to be overly scientific. As a general rule for
sci-fi
films, if you want people of any scientific persuasion to suspend their
disbelief then last thing that you want to do is start offering
half-scientific explanations as in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. They simply end up
sounding
like nonsense and the film loses credibility. Wonderful though the human
body may be, the thermodynamic properties, which it is given in &quot;The
Matrix&quot;
come across as being simply contrived.<br /><br />As for the acting, although I was not expecting great characterisation
since
it is after all an action film, the most flattering comment I can give on
the characters in &quot;The Matrix&quot; is that they are two-dimensional
stereotypes.
Keanu Reeves can pull it off at the beginning as the slightly geeky
computer-hacker, but as an action hero he just ends up looking silly.
Laurence Fishbourne never gets into his part either and looks rather
disinterested all the way through. To be fair to the actors the script
that
they have to work with is dire. When not going into contrived
semi-scientific explanations, it generally consists of meaningless
prophetic
babble.<br /><br />It would be hard to talk about &quot;The Matrix&quot; without saying something about
the special effects. There is no denying that they are impressive, however
they add absolutely nothing to the film. Normally such effects are used to
increase the credibility of a film by making out of the ordinary events
look
as if they are actually happening. In &quot;The Matrix&quot; it seems that the
effects
department decided to simply use the movie as an excuse to show off. The
fight sequences are nicely choreographed, although they tended to rather
inexplicably go into slow motion with lots of camera panning. While the
effects were pretty, they seemed to be rather extraneous to the film,
rather
than complementing the action, as they should.<br /><br />A large number of people seemed to really enjoy &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which is a
fact that I find completely inexplicable. I guess if you are the sort of
person who goes in for meaningless action and pretty special effects then
this film may be for you. Otherwise I find it very difficult to recommend
this film to anyone. The question as to whether we can really be sure of
reality may be interesting, but it is nothing novel, as countless
philosophers have asked it over the ages. This film really is a woeful
effort to explore the concept and no amount of fancy camerawork can hide
that.
