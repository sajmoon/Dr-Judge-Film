The Matrix had very visually compelling effects all thoughout this film.
The Matrix goes from one world to another. From the year 1999, beyond and
to
other worlds of reality, but yet real.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves(Neo), Lauance Fisbone(Morphis), and Carrie Ann Moss(Trinity)
did all outstanding jobs as the action preformers thoughout this film.<br /><br />Though it had the best visual effects and great actors/actresses, I saw no
story put into it.  There was a story, but a small one.  Not enough for me
to see.<br /><br />But still, I recommend this film to teenagers and adults.  Kids too, but
yet
there's quite a bit of violance (not much gore).  If your looking for a
good
action-scifi thriller, this is the perfect film.
