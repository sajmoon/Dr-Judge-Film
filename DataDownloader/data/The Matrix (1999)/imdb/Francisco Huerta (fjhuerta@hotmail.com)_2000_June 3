&quot;The Matrix&quot; came out on the worst of times: just weeks before the most
anticipated sci-fi film of all time was to come out: &quot;The Phantom
Menace&quot;.<br /><br />Well the menace was definitely &quot;a phantom&quot;, so to speak. And while hordes
of
gullible fans talked about how great Lucas' latest space opera was, many
more had discovered what they feared the most: that Matrix was everything
&quot;Phantom&quot; should have been, and then more.<br /><br />The film has so many high points is difficult to start. The visual effects
are simply stunning; there is no eye candy, ala Star Wars I; every single
one is used as a way to get you deeper into the movie. The &quot;Bullet time&quot;
technique is used throughout the picture, and it makes it seem as slick as
the best piece of japanimation out there. The storyline is perfectly
written: it manages to convince you that somehow it could all be possible.
Neo/Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) tells the whole story with his facial
expressions of disbelief on the first 3/4 of the film, and then with self
assurance. The rest of the cast makes you actually care for their fate
(specially Carrie-Ann Moss and Lawrence Fishborne). And before the first
half of the movie is over, you will hate the bad guys. Believe
me.<br /><br />I, as incredible as it might seem, am not waiting for &quot;Matrix 2&quot;. The first
installment is so good I fear they won't be able to live up to its
reputation (again, like Lucas did with &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;). Still, I am
crossing my fingers and hoping I will be surprised and mesmerized.
Again.
