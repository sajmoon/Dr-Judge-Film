1999_April 5 

This is the best film I have ever seen from the Wachowski brothers and the
best sci-fi film I've seen in years.  Possibly Apollo 13 was better, but
that isn't really sci fi though.  The acting in this film is to the max
(Reeves won't ever be as good as Fishburne though)and the fight scenes
(ninjitsu) were scenes John Woo might wanna copy.  The story plot outline
is very confusing to explain (like the commercial says- Unforunately, we
do
not know what the Matrix is.  You'll have to see it for yourself<br /><br />But I will say this movie has almost of it all.  It is only weakened by
the
confusion it sets by the plot.  But that's all.  Great effects, the best
soundtrack (Marylin Manson's &quot;Rock is Dead) and terrific weapons (and
dodges).
