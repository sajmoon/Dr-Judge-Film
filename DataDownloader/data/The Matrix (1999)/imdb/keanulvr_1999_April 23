This was a great movie! I love Keanu Reeves and I loved the plot and I most
of all loved the special effects! They were so great! I mean what is real?
Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss were awesome! I loved the kung-fu
and the way they all looked so cool fighting! I also thought it was soooooo
cool when they would freeze an object in the air or on the ground (the water
part when Morpheus got shot in the ankle) and then they would take the
&quot;camera&quot; and rotate it around the object! Like when Trinity jumped up at the
beginning and when Neo and the head agent guy jumped at one another! I also
loved the part with the dodging bullets and when Trinity said, &quot;dodge this&quot;
and shot the agent in the head (kinda gruesome) good thing they actually
didn't show it! This movie is so awesome I have seen it 3 times and I
recommend you go see it again!
