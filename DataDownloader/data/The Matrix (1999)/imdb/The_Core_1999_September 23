&quot;The Matrix&quot; is arguably the most imaginative Science Fiction vision ever
brought to life on the big screen.  Combine that vision with incredible
action, special effects and acting, and you have a movie that transcends
its
genre.  The Matrix, like Star Wars was in 1977, is 5-10 years ahead of its
time.  Is it Science Fiction?  Mythology?  An action film?  You decide.
Once again, like Star Wars, I feel that it's a combination of all three.
Like Star Wars, it's a perfect 10/10.  And like Star Wars (and Blade
Runner), it will become a cult classic in the years to come.  Superlative,
imaginative filmmaking.  If you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself for
the ride of your life.
