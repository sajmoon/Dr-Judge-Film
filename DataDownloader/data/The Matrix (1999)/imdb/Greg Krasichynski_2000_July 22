<br /><br />Why do people see the concepts of the story as metaphoric?  How are they
any
less than real?  Sure, a few visual and plot devices were used to
represent
a society being operated by a totalitarian remote, and that may constitute
symbolism, but the principles are at work in the world around us every
minute of every day.  I am slightly concerned that this movie leads people
to believe it was more a sci-fi story with a social commentary, than it
was
a simple observation of society and how it actually works.<br /><br />The whole post-apocalyptic messiah story is more than a bit tired, it's on
life support, but that detracted little from the movie for me - Keanu
needs
to be the chosen one, aw, let him pretend.<br /><br />Where the movie disappointed was in its degeneration from a thoughtful and
interesting and visually spiffy romp through the concerns of the oppressed
masses into a string of Starsky and Hutch chase scenes climaxing in a hail
of gunfire.<br /><br />Is a yank movie somehow incomplete without that seemingly requisite &quot;only
the NRA has the final solution to save the universe and that answer is
limitless ammo&quot; message?  Chucky &quot;God loves guns&quot; Heston must have creamed
his jeans when he saw all the big bang-bangs.<br /><br />If you can forgive the individualist-supremacy hammer that the end of the
movie hits you in the face with, it's great.<br /><br />Fortunately, I can suspend that disbelief just because of the quality of
the
story, concepts, observations and execution of everything =up to= the
denouement.  Watch it for the story.
