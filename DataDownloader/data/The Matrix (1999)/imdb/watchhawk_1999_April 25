The Matrix is an awesome fighting experience with a dull story and is almost
devoid of any charm.  Humans are supposed to be fighting with superbrainy
machines but I get to wonder who is human in this whole affair.  It is feast
of the eye but not the mind since there isn't any mental punch to it. The
matrix is nowhere and anywhere and that is exactly the way I felt after
seeing this film.  There is no message and nearing the end when love of a
woman gave the final edge needed to out-stunt the bad guys, the film became
unbearably ridiculous.  Still this film is not a bad film to see, unless you
want to do something meaningful with your time......,but who wants that
anyhow.
