1999_April 5 

&quot;The Matrix&quot; is absolutely the best film of the century.  It has the best
story, the best actors, and the best directors.  I was amazed how all the
pieces were put up together.  It comes out the only film that is worthwhile
watching over and over.  I will keep it in my DVD collections and watch the
movie AT LEAST one more time.  If you miss watching this film, I would have
suggested you not to be born.  GO SEE IT!!!
