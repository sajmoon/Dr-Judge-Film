1999_April 5 

If seeing the latest special effects offered by Hollywood is your thing and
you can't wait for 'The Phantom Menace' then seeing 'The Matrix' is
mandatory. As a genre film I was prepared to call it a near-masterpiece...
until what is perhaps the most contrived, most used solution to solve the
hero-in-big-trouble crisis moment appeared... then it took 10 minutes to
forget that moment... during the climax. Ignore that ultimate-cliche moment
and it's a great story. The bad guys are the ultimate 'Men In Black,' Reeves
comes as close as he ever has to credible acting and Fishburne is solid as
always. A sci-fi must-see.
