It has to be the best sci-fi movie out there. Maybe even better then Star
Wars. &quot;The Matrix&quot; has to at least beat &quot;Titantic&quot; in the box office. There
is no movie out there that could outdo it. The plot and characters were
perfect. The plot is very complicated and to me unpredictable. When I went
to see this movie I thought,&quot;well another predictable action movie without a
plot.&quot; But then afterwards I was so impressed that I was in awe of it for
over an hour. I couldn't believe it! Somebody actually made a movie that
literally made Star Wars look like a little kids movie.
