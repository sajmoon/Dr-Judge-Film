1999_July 7 

The bottom line is that I give this movie &quot;two thumbs up&quot; and a solid 10.
It
rocks! In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I've already been to see it
twice
and -- yeah, I'm a square -- I've never done that before. Unless you're
old
and crusty, and/or terminally unhip, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />The central theme revolves around the state of human existence: reality,
dream or -- for today's technologically fearless audiences -- virtual
reality? A dream within a dream? And, if so, how do we break out? Is this
deeply philosophical, hugely meaningful, or merely trite? We're in plot
cliche territory. Now add a heavy &quot;good vs evil&quot; line and a biblical
allegory on death and redemption -- not to mention &quot;the one&quot; -- and some
love interest and... danger, danger Will Robinson. Sounds way hokey,
right?<br /><br />Well, it ain't. I don't know how they pulled it off, but these Wachowski
brothers have taken this basic concept and produced a stunning movie: a
plot
that is coherent, involving, and emotionally moving; a cool script; LOUD
soundtrack; loads of great fight scenes; supercool special effects; and
good
acting (especially Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, Laurence Fishburne as
Morpheus, and -- surprise, surprise -- Keanu Reeves as
Neo).<br /><br />This film is LONG, nearly 2 and a quarter hours, but I sat there and
enjoyed
every minute. This was as close to cinematic perfection as I think I'll
ever
get.<br /><br />
