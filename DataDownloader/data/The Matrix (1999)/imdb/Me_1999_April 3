1999_April 3 

This movie is great, a definite must see for any fan of The Terminator
(1&amp;2), Total Recall, Blade Runner and/or Strange Days. Also has the
eerieness
of Se7en and Dark City.<br /><br />Even with Keanu's background of poor acting in poor scripts, he makes a
nice
comeback with this movie.  Laurence Fishburne (aka Cowboy Curtis) is also
great.  Plus, lets not forget that Trinity (Carrie-anne
Moss)!<br /><br />Any one that doesn't think this movie is great, tell me what is?  It has
action (setting a new standard in visual effects), a great story (any
comic
book fan will love), a sappy love angle (probably the only poor part of
the
movie) and great suspense.<br /><br />The only ones I can see not liking this film are people that don't have
the
intelligence to follow the story.  Some women that are Action film haters
may not like it either,
although when I saw it on opening night, 75% of the audience were women,
and
they all loved it.
