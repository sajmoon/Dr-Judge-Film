It's hard to define the standards of what makes a good sci-fi movie but,
IMO, they must challenge and question our concepts of the world as it is
and
where it's heading.
Whether they paint an optimistic or darker portrait of the future, they
should avoid merely projecting present trends into the future and try
instead to focus on all aspects of human society.<br /><br />The Matrix tries very hard to fall into that categorie but it fails on all
accounts.<br /><br />The movie owes a lot of its mass appeal to the fact that it combines a
number of things that are highly popular in modern culture. Among these is
the age-old cliche concept of &quot;me-against-a-large-scale-ennemy-entity&quot;.
When
I was a teenager,
I went to see every sci-fi movie in which Charlton Heston played. I thought
he was so cool the way he wielded guns and pitted himself against a mob of
vampires or a totalitarian police state
that wanted to control and dominate people.<br /><br />Today, Keanu Reeves has filled in for ol' Charlton who's still in love with
guns. Sci-fi movies may have gotten more sophisticated, thanks to computer
imagery and SFX, but in other aspects, they seldom offer innovation and
originality. The idea that the physical world is an artificial construct
meant to deceive us is not new and original. Sci-fi writers such as Alfred
Bester or Philip K Dick have used it in their novels way back in the '50s
and '60s.<br /><br />Recommendation?
At its best, this movie is a roller coaster ride filled with terrific
stunts
and special effects. Much like Total Recall.
If that's your idea of a good movie, then go for it. It will meet your
expectations.<br /><br />At its worst, it's a silly combination of computer games, martial arts,
sci-fi and film noir style and look. The characters portrayed have as much
deepness as the typical comic book heroes. Add to that the naive pretention
that computer hackers and information technology will eventually help us
save the world and you've got one of the most absurd movies of all times.
Still worth renting if you haven't seen it, just for curiosity's
sake.<br /><br />Trendy? Yes, all the way. Prophetic? You gotta be kidding!<br /><br />Rating: 5/10
