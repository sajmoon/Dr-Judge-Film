1999_December 9 

What else can I say.....it's a good movie but not great like I heard most
people say it was.  I know, everybody else is calling it a &quot;deep&quot; movie that
will change the way you look at the world around us.....but I gotta tell ya,
it was just another sci-fi actioner to me. And let's face it, Keanu Reeves
has about as much acting talent as Steven Seagal.  But that's okay as long
as he sticks to action films and doesn't try to breakout into more serious
fare.  Anyways, good action, good special effects=good sci-fi action movie. 
I've seen better in the same genre, such as Blade or Soldier.
