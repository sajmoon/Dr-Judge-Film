2001_September 20 

I'm not sure if this movie will be regarded as favorably in ten years time
as it is now. Maybe future reviewers will laugh at the crude 'bullet-time'
effects, snigger at the blatant product placement of archaic cellphones,
yawn at the reluctant-hero-facing-an-overpowerful-enemy theme, dismiss the
philosophizing on reality as a forced attempt by second grader and scratch
their heads thinking how Reeves could go from this to his Oscar winning
spree five years later...<br /><br />But for now it stands as a guilty pleasure, for me at least.<br /><br />And on a further note, can't the Matrix just be seen as life in general,
instead of this computer controlled system. Is the Matrix not really about
the limitations that we put on ourselves, inhibiting to live life to the
fullest. A dreary job behind a desk, consuming, and acting out the role that
society has mapped out for us etc. that stand in the way of fully
experiencing the wonders of this world, or as Trinity puts it: &quot;You know
where that roads leads to, Neo. You know exactly where it ends. And I know
that you don't want to be there.&quot; <br /><br />Or something like that
