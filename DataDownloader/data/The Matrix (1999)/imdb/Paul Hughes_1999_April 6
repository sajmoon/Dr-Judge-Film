1999_April 6 

I absolutely loved this movie!  This movie is
all plot!  The special effects are the medium to express it.  We all know
how amazing those two films are.  I expect this film to do very well at
the
box office and continue to garnish a steady stream of revenue for many
years to come as a favorite cult classic of the techno-savvy and
psychologically astute audience.  This is not a film for the
sedate.<br /><br />For those familiar with Moore's law and the eventual emergence of
nanotechnology, the plausibility of 'The Matrix' is all to real.  The
Matrix
reminds us of the value of our humanity and I think cautions us to wake up
and not take things for granted; that we may go forward with wisdom and
compassion aboard a technological rocket ride that frees us, not enslaves
us.  The message is simple - increase your intelligence
now!
