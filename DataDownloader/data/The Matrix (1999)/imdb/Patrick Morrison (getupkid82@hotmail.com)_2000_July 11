It's difficult to add anything of substance to what people have written
here
about &quot;The Matrix&quot;, except to say that we might now have to view Science
Fiction movies in a post-&quot;Matrix&quot; context - The Wachowski Brothers' film
changed the cinematic playing field forever.<br /><br />After seeing &quot;The Matrix&quot; (And spiritually similar films like &quot;Three Kings&quot;
and &quot;Fight Club&quot;, which do wonderfully subversive things with their chosen
genre), I was filled with a sense of possibilities for the future of cinema
in the 21st century.  &quot;The Matrix 2&quot; can't arrive in cinemas quickly
enough.<br /><br />As far as Keanu Reeves' much-derided acting is concerned, I believe that
people are being too hard on him - He has a welcome bravery and lack of
cynicism, taking far more chances in the role of Neo than his peers would.
He's not afraid to embody an irony-free innocence and to play the whole
film's journey towards discovery and identity with great honesty - In
essence, he's being true to the Wachowski's material.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are fantastic - Fishburne is a total Zen master,
Carrie-Anne Moss a goddess and the great Joe Pantoliano gets another
welcome
chance to shine.<br /><br />Quite simply, &quot;The Matrix&quot; takes you to a completely different world for
two
hours and that's kind of the reason that I go to the cinema for - To see
something new and exhilarating, which this film certainly
is.
