Neo, the film's central character, has a problem with the reality of the
world surrounding him. Like so many philosophers before him, he poses the
questions: Is it real? And, through a number of adventures, he finds that
it
is not. The world, as he knows it, is but an intricate make-believe, wool
pulled over our eyes by intelligent machines. It is the Matrix, designed
to
maintain the illusion of the late twentieth century in the minds of humans
vegetating on huge breeding farms and supplying the machines with
bio-electricity.<br /><br />The Matrix is a very entertaining and even intelligent film, however, it
leaves one question unanswered. How would Neo know that he had really
exited
the Matrix? How can he be sure that what he perceives as the real world as
opposes to the reality of the Matrix, is really real?<br /><br />Could this be on purpose? Is there a sequel, a Matrix II. coming, where
Neo
find that Zion, the last stronghold of humans is also just a part of the
Matrix? Then he would have to break out of there too, to find reality - a
reality that, once again, may be called to doubt, leading on to Matrix III
and beyond...
