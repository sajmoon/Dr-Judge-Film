1999_June 29 

I saw this movie twice, and probably am going to see it once again. This
is
a superb film which combines action with science fiction and adds some
philosophical questions too. I read some comments which say that the story
is crap, but that isn't the point. The point is that it makes you think!
The
Matrix is just a story of an interpretation of reality and we all do that
once in a while. We all sometimes question what is real and what is not.
The
Matrix is an enormously rich movie, that's why you should see it more than
once.<br /><br />The first time you can sit back and just enjoy what you are seeing, and
you
will see much. During the first part of the movie not just Neo is
introduced
into 'another' world, but we as viewers are too. And it just takes you
away.
Only super objective people can say that they are not 'sucked' into the
movie. You won't be bored, I can guarantee you. The visual aspects are
astonishing, the action scenes are perfect and don't forget the
soundtrack!
First of all it's a super action movie.<br /><br />The second time, when you know what is going to happen, you can think
about
what you see. The story has pretension, it's about rethinking all that is
familiar. Is the world what it seems to be? The symbolism within the movie
is also overwhelming: it's Plato's cave mixed with the story of Jesus
Christ. Sometimes you will see flaws in the storyline (especially in the
end, when I started thinking we were in an adaptation of Snowwhite), but
that doesn't matter, because after the movie has ended, it's just fun
thinking (and talking) further about it.
Imagine the moral implications of it all: especially the Cypher-character
is
interesting. What would we do in his situation? In general: Who is good
and
who is bad in the movie? Is that distinction possible?<br /><br />I can really recommend this movie to all moviegoers, I'd rate it 9 out of
10. (By the way: Laurence Fishburne is magnificent)
