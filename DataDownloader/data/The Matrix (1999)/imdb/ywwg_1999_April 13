1999_April 13 

What do you get when you take the Terminator, Dark City, and Mortal Kombat
and throw it all together? The Matrix.  When I first saw the previews, I was
sure it was just another effects extravaganza with nothing behind it, but it
was actually a great &quot;popcorn movie&quot;; it was fun to watch.<br /><br />It contains plenty of surrealistic gunfights, kung-fu fights (&quot;you're out of
bullets!&quot; &quot;so are you!&quot; &quot;how convenient! now we must fight!&quot;), and trippy
special effects to keep anyone interested, while not taking itself too
seriously.  How _any_ film besides Star Wars can talk about an &quot;oracle,&quot; and
&quot;the one,&quot; and &quot;dessssstiny&quot; without making an audience crack up is amazing,
but this one pulls it off.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the Episode One trailer is attached to the movie
:)<br /><br />Things _not_ to do while watching The Matrix:<br /><br />- DO NOT play &quot;air guitars&quot; whenever Keanu says something like     &quot;whoa.&quot;
He's really not bad in this one.<br /><br />- DO NOT speak for Vader and say &quot;it is your dessssstiny.&quot;         Fishburne
does fine on his own.<br /><br />- DO NOT count plot holes.<br /><br />- DO NOT complain that movies don't portray computers as they      actually
look like in Real Life.<br /><br />- DO NOT get tense.  You think this is a movie where the bad       guys win?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.<br /><br />- DO NOT count the number of movies The Matrix &quot;borrows&quot; from.     You'll be
talking throughout the movie.
