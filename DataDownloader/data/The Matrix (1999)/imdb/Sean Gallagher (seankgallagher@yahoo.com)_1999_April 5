1999_April 5 

There are two names behind THE MATRIX, one which made me interested, and one
which gave me pause.  The one that made me interested is the Wachowski
brothers, who made the highly entertaining 1996 thriller BOUND.  The one
which gave me pause is Joel Silver, whose movies seem to function primarily
as a way to pound people into submission.  Happily, THE MATRIX represents
the sensibilities of the former more than the latter.  The ideas it throws
out in this film are similar to last year's DARK CITY, and this is more or
less a high-octane version of that, but it's entertaining, and the
philosophy doesn't get in the way of the story.  The only time it gets to be
like a Joel Silver movie is at the climax, when it becomes overkill.  Still,
this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year so
far.
