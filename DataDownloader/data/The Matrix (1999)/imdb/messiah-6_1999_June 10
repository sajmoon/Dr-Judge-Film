This movie is definitely the red pill, all the others are blue.  It has
great special effects, and actually has a great plot!  For people out
there
who don't think Keanu is a good actor. . . .guess again!  He was perfect
for
the role as well as the rest!  For those of you giving The Matrix a rating
that is below a 7. . . .you guys should see it again.  How could you give
it
a one?  Just because it has Keanu in it?  So?  He was perfect for this!
And
for those of you who think it is really annoying that the agents always
e-nun-ci-ate the words, they have to!  They're machines, artificial
intelligence for god sakes!  They're not human.  Now, for those of you who
thinks they wear very cheesy suits, you are wrong!  They are AGENTS!
Whoever does not like this movie is not a hardcore Sci-fi fanatic!  So get
the hell out of here and watch it again!
