1999_August 8 

Saw the flick twice and got absolutely WOWED two times ! The movie holds
moments of sheer visual magic (watch out for those too short moments :
giant
spider-like nurses in the &quot;real world&quot;). While it succeeds completely in
setting a peculiar tone and mood, the numerous winks and outward jokes
blend
in nicely and help you get through the heavy set atmosphere and
breath-taking heart-throbbing action. To top it all, the way they (the
wachowsky guys) mix &quot;real&quot; scenes with FX-altered ones is just grand, you
just BELIEVE it (there is no spoon, though...)
