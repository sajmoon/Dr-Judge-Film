1999_April 17 

To give you the honest truth when I first went to see this movie I
expected
a general old fashioned run of the mill great special FX with good action
but
absolutley no Plot! Well I am happy to say I was mistaken about this
movie!
From the opening scene the whole way to the end of the movie I was
captivated and in awe. The FX were great, the acting above average
especially for Keanu Reeves who I have found in the past to be bland and
dry
as an actor, but he really excelled with this part. There were a few plot
holes, but they did not take away from the movie at all, overall it was a
great movie and after you get done watching it you will be asking yourself
lots of questions about what is really real in this &quot;world&quot; we live
in!
