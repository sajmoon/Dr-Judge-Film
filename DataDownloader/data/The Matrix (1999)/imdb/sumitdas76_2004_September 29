Its somewhere in the year 2197, where human beings are used as cells to
generate electricity for the AI (Artificial Intelligence) machines.
Humans are no longer born but grown in human fields; not unlike paddy
fields. The machines now walk the earth and keep us in a dream state.
The machines use a piece of software called &quot;Matrix&quot; the purpose of
which is to keep the sleeping humans in a dream world where they sleep,
work, play, etc etc. A group of the &quot;grown&quot; human beings have managed
to awaken from the dream world with the help of a soothsayer, the
&quot;Oracle&quot; (Gloria Foster). They fight the machines and search for the
&quot;One&quot; who will free the human race from the machines. This group
consists of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss),
Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), etc.<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the chosen one who is awakened by Morpheus and
ultimately defeats the sentinels/guards of the Matrix. Agent Smith
(Hugo Weaving) is menacing as the leader of the sentinels. The action
sequences (bullet-time effect) will surely leave the audience
spellbound.
