First of all, I recommend seeing the anime &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, because
after you see this and then watch the Matrix, you will see that the
Matrix
is not as revolutionary as before. Within Ghost in the Shell, there is
slow-motion-action &quot;bullettime&quot;, and the concept of computer
intelligence,
with the overarching question &quot;who am I, why am I here, what do I do.&quot;
But
anyway, the Matrix did bring the slow-motion action and many new special
effects types to the silver screen. Keanu Reeves also has a pretty good
cast
part in the movie, as long as he is cast well, he performs his parts
excellently. The soundtrack is also a pretty good fit to the content of
the
film. I'll be interested in how the story plays out in the next few
years.
