2000_August 6 

To start of there is one thing I can say about this movie,<br /><br />FABULOUS.
This is the kind of movie that digs deep, very deep in to our
own existence, to make you believe how fragile our reality
actually is, and this for a science-fiction movie, chapeau.
2001 a space oddesey  had similar fundamental moral
lessons about life but this movie combines that with an
ultimate cinematografic experience!
The switch between Green and Blue layers to make it easy
on the viewers to tell the difference between fiction and
reality are a nice touch.
The combined slow-mo and highspeed frame scenes are
a pleasure for the eye.
Hugo Weaving does an excellent job as agent Smith, great
moves from Keanu Reeves as Neo and Mr. Cool himself
Laurence Fishburn as Morpheus.
There is 1 thing left to say for me, can't wait to see the
sequel's.
