Excellent. One of my all time great films for watchability and
entertainment. I own this film on DVD, and can watch it at any time. With
most films, you have to wait until the memories subside before watching it
again, but with Matrix, I can watch it at any time, even back to back. In
fact, multiple viewings of this film should be compulsary. The first time is
excellent, but there are alot of subtle references during the film that
don't click until you've seen the whole film, so it is worth watching again
when you know exactly what is going on. 
The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes perfect, even Keanu puts
in a decent performance. Fishburne is excellent, as are the supporting cast.
Watch it many times, NOW! I only hope the two pending sequels don't ruin
this.
