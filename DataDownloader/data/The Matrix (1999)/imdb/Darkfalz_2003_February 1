If you've ever heard a diehard Matrix fan talk about this movie, you can
really begin to understand what &quot;hype&quot; is.<br /><br />There's no doubt I enjoyed the movie. It's very entertaining. But as far as
it having all these levels of meaning, in being ground-breaking in anything
other than the interesting &quot;bullet time&quot; camera work? It wasn't
here.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers are more or less just very good hacks. They took the
main plot directly out of Terminator and gave it a virtual reality twist and
a techno sound-track. They even stole the idea of having a blue tinge to
everything, then when they realised that was too obvious they changed it to
green.<br /><br />The acting is somewhat of a let down, but it can be overlooked considering
the nature of the film. It isn't meant to be high drama after all. Generally
it is poor, especially from Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss. Their
characters don't really require a lot of acting ability, but they still
manage to seem wooden and unconvincing for the most part. This isn't helped
by the poor dialogue throughout.<br /><br />There are some good performances though, particularly Hugo Weaving and Joe
Palantino. Fishbourne was OK, but the rest of the cast don't deserve a
mention - except for Marcus Chong, not for his acting, but for his real life
career ending stupidity in getting kicked off the sequels by demanding equal
billing in them. Considering his character was probably the most expendable
that wasn't very smart.<br /><br />Another let down was the tacky &quot;love story&quot;. If you thought Episode II had a
stupid, nonsensical romantic element, it's nothing compared to The Matrix.
Trinity more or less &quot;falls in love&quot; with Neo because a) he's good looking
and b) lack of other options.<br /><br />One other thing I didn't really like was the lead in to the story. The first
half hour or so is spent trying to convince the audience &quot;this is going to
be so cool, and meaningful, and deep, we are really on to something special
here&quot; and when you have time to look back on it, this self hype to the main
plot was poorly executed and cheapens the film a lot. A movie shouldn't
insult its audience by trying to tell them what to think of it before it
gets anywhere.<br /><br />Other than that this is enjoyable movie, which becomes sillier the more
seriously you take it. So enjoy it for what it is, a brainless sci-fi
special effects vehicle.
