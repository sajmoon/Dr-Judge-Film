A historic movie!!A perfect modern concept of the bible,and an anarchic
way
to see life and world.I think it's not a case that the movie went out in
1999,that is,at the end of the millennium:it introduces the philosophy and
the mentality of new people's generation,and an absolutely free way to
build
one's life,destroying the idea and the concept of destiny.We're in front
of
the triumph of relativism,which is something that confutes every form of
law
that's thought to exist between humans.Every one of us is &quot;the one&quot; of our
life itself,and this movie underlines how this fact is important but often
forgot by ourselves.
Well done,just well done!!
