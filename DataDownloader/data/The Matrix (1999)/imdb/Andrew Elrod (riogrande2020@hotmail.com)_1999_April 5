1999_April 5 

This is one of those movies that, if you're a big sci-fi fan, you just wish
you could jump into.  The technology level in the movie is enough to drop a
computer nut's jaw through the floor.  The premise of the movie is terrific,
and like the Truman Show did, makes you wonder if this just might be true.
The special effects are astounding, and while they appear a lot in the
movie, aren't over done in the least.  And I hope that Keanu Reeves finally
discovers that Sci-Fi/cyberpunk is his thing.  With The Matrix complimenting
his performance in Johnny Mnemonic, he's broken through as an excellent
actor in this field.<br /><br />Over all, excellent, 3 1/2 out of 4, and definitely a must see
again.
