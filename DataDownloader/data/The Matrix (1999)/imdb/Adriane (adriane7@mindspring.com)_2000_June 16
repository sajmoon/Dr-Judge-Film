All competitors have met their match with this movie. I agree with other
comments when they say that this movie sets the tone for sci-fi/action films
in the next few years. I had my mother watch it and we both agree on one
thing: take away the action, and when you are left with the dialogue only,
it is a sad movie. Are we just a spreading virus? The dialogue makes you
think about the world you live in. Watch the movie, and reflect on your
life. It is highly enjoyable. One of the best of 1999.
