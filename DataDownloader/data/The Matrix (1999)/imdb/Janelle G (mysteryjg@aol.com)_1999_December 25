Many see The Matrix as simply a rush of mind-bending special effects, but
that is just an added bonus to the plot and cast.  This movie brings
together action and science-fiction in a well blended mixture sure to send
your senses into overdrive.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne give
terrific performances as Neo and Morpheus, respectfully.  Carrie-Anne Moss
does an excellent job playing Trinity, and she will become invaluable to
Hollywood to years to come.  Hopefully all three will reappear for the
announced sequels to this 1999 blockbuster.
