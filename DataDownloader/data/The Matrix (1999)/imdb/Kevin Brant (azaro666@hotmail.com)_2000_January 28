The diversity of the brothers Wachowski is quite incredible. Almost trying
to prove that it takes no talent to make the same film over and over again
(Spielberg?). They go from Bound to this. Bound being a lesbian film-noir,
Matrix being a movie which is sure to be imitated as we go technology
crazy
in the C21. Putting Keanu in a high budget, special-effects laden vision
of
the future (or the present) may have seemed like a big gamble. Keanu had
been making stinkers for a long time and had yet proved he had a real
talent
or box-office pull. Yet they have placed him in position of what must have
been a hard fought for role. Then having seen Keanu as Neo, it is
impossible
to imagine anyone else being the computer nerd of the future. It may not
be
a real role of emotional stretch but these are often the hardest ones to
bring life to. Keanu manages it and has also cemented his place on the
Hollywood A-List.<br /><br />It is an action movie, for sure. Let that not distract you though. The
action is there and also the possibility that effects can over-shadow the
ability this movie has to affect. A vision of the vision as bleak as this
has been shown before but this movie really does give you the potential to
believe that we are already living the future.<br /><br />The plot may be a little confusing but the pace of the adventure doesn't
try
to throw the plot out the window. For effects fans, as well as
entertainment
seekers alike this movie tells us that the future of Keanu as well as the
Brothers Wachowski is very bright indeed.
