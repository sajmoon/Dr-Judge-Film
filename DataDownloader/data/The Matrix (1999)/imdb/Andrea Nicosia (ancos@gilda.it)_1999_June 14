A superb movie. I don't think it's going to be the new Star Wars, for its
impact on the sci-fi scene, but for sure we have the new &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.<br /><br />A truly cyberpunk flick, maybe the only one worth of note, along with
Salvatores' &quot;Nirvana&quot;, and easily the best.
A contamination of western visions and Jon Woo filming techniques, it will
mark the road for future productions.
