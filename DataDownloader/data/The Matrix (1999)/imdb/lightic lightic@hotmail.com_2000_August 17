OK, I've read some of the comments and I got really surprised! I thought
that everyone would be positive about this movie... Foolish me. Anyhow,
now,
after have read the negative comments I understand... I understand that
these people don't like the idea with a &quot;real world/dream world&quot;-concept,
sadly. They think it's pretentious, dumb or unreal. They're complaining
about the bad performance from the actors and such.<br /><br />I think that I'm gonna straight some out here... First of all, yes, this
is
a REALLY unreal movie. Although, being a BIG fan, I think so too. But that
doesn't bother me one bit! I like that! If you don't, then - don't bother!
The story follows it's own pattern. You've probably never seen anything
quite this strange before. It exist, though, I know. But it's RARE!<br /><br />It's NOT another
&quot;one-man-who-saves-the-world-with-one-machine-gun-and-gets-the-girl&quot;-movie!!
This movie got taste, depth and a whole new atmosphere, never seen before.
And that's for sure!
You can't compare it with other movies, like &quot;M:I-2&quot; and &quot;Die Hard&quot;...
This
is an altogether new film! &quot;M:I-2&quot; is nothing like &quot;The Matrix&quot;... You may
think so because of the cool special effects with &quot;bullet time&quot;-filming
and
such, but you are way out if you're comparing. By the way, &quot;M:I-2&quot; is fun
and cool but it really suck on story-basis!<br /><br />Secondly, the special effects ARE truly very good and great. The visuals,
sounds and filming-techniques is extremely new and extremely well-made!
The
actors are not bad. They are not EXTREMELY good but they didn't suck!
Remember that it took roughly 4 years to make this film, if it wasn't
more... I'm not sure. Anyhow, I liked almost every person in the movie.
They
had a very broad integrity and you kinda' got friend with them...!
=)<br /><br />And furthermore, I hope everyone understands the movie and its concept,
BEFORE criticizing it! At least, see it twice before you criticize it -
EVEN if
you liked it! You will probably not understand everything
otherwise!<br /><br />
