has anyone noticed all the parallels of this movie and the life of Jesus
Christ?
I have, we watched this movie during school (i goto a Christian one) and
after talked about all the parallels that we saw.  There were quite a
few, a
lot of the talk about neo being 'the one' as was Jesus.  Look closely
when
it shows the ships  name plate thingy, it says 'mark 3 number 11' that
verse
has alot to do with the movie if you read mark 3:11 in the
bible.<br /><br />peace out
