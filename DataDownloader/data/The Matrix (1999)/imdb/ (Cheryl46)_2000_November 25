So I was half dragged to the movie by some friends.  Let's just say, yes,
I
agree with some of the previous reviews, the movie tried too hard.  For
someone who's never seen any fighting scenes like this before, they might
be
jaw-dropped at the end, but to me it's nothing more than a cliche.  Maybe
I
am biased about Keanu Reeves, never liked him, probably never will.  He
struck me as a half brain macho man, but it might help some if he could
talk
a little more intelligibly.<br /><br />Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon on the other hand could have been a much
better other half.  Although I personally haven't seen it, it's gotten a
lot
of really good reviews.
