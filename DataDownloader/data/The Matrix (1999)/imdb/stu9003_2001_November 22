The Matrix is considered a sci-fi classic for good reason. The action
scenes are simply outstanding. The last 20 minutes feature some of the
most thrilling action sequences ever put on film. <br /><br />Also, the whole concept of the Matrix is fascinating. The trailer
teases audiences with the question &#x22;What is the matrix? There&#x27;s no way
to describe it. You have to see it for yourself.&#x22; Well, when you see
the movie and find out what The Matrix really is, you&#x27;re not
disappointed. <br /><br />If there is a weak spot in the movie it&#x27;s in the middle when they get
caught up in the whole &#x22;Chosen One&#x22; storyline. This is too good a movie
to rely on such a stupid plot device. The whole sequence of events
surrounding this plot line reminded me of a really bad Japanese
animated movie I once saw where one of the characters kept saying &#x22;I
don&#x27;t understand! I thought I was the chosen one!&#x22; (or something like
that). Why can&#x27;t they just say, &#x22;he&#x27;s got great potential&#x22; and leave it
at that. Let&#x27;s forget about trying to create some Christ figure.
