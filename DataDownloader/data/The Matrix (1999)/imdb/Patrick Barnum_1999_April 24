Wow!  This is such a great movie!  The film is packed with great characters
and the idea of what &quot;The Matrix&quot; is.  Although, it does lack a general
sense of purpose, it is still great!  Also, I believe that it gives the
viewer a sense of purpose and making the most out of everyday.  So, go see
it and enjoy it!
