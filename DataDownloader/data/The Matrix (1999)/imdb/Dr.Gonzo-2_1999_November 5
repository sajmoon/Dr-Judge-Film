1999_November 5 

Special effects do not make a movie (proof:  ID4, The Lost World, Lost in
Space, etc., etc. ad nauseum).  The Matrix is proof that you don't need a
good script or decent actors to have a movie as long as you get
shots--digitally or traditionally--which no one else has ever used.  The
plot is dense and the acting appalling.  Nice soundtrack and exceptional
digital sound effects made the movie tolerable.  Forget the hype with this
one and save yourself some money.
