2000_December 3 

One of the best films of the decade and perhaps the finest sci-fi of all
time finds these merits--not from its excellent visual and special
effects--but from its philosophical underpinnings.<br /><br />The power of The Matrix comes from its (unintended?) inspiration from the
Christ story of bondage and blindness to the illusionary natural world of
pleasures for a season vs. the truth of eternal life through the
sacrificial
blood of the Lamb of God, Christ the Messiah.  There are so many
comparisons
between the Christian world-view as portrayed in Scripture and The
Matrix---be it the natural/supernatural and Matrix/non-Matrix experiences
or
Christ as Redeemer and Neo as Savior---that is is impossible to belief
that
were it not for the Christ-story, The Matrix (the movie) would have ever
existed.<br /><br />That is not a criticism.  Just a testament that the greatest stories find
their sources in a reality higher than our own and a select few have
opened
their minds enough to tap into this truth.
