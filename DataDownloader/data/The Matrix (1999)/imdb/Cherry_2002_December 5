The Matrix was an incredible movie. There were so many parallels to the
Life
of Christ I don't even know where to start. Neo was just like Christ,
Jesus
started his ministry when he was around 31, which is almost exactly when
Neo
was found by Morpheus. All the people on the ship were like the disciples
Jesus had during his ministry. Also each one of the characters on the ship
could be compared to one of Christ's disciples. There is so much
foreshadowing in the movie also. In the beginning a couple people call Neo
their &quot;Savior&quot; and also the crew would mutter &quot;Jesus&quot; under their breath
quite a bit. The faith that Morpheus had can be symbolized to all the
faith
people had in Jesus when he healed them of their sickness and such.
Everything that happens to Neo throughout the movie is almost the exact
life
Christ led. This is just unbelievable that a movie that was so popular had
such a different theme than it first portrayed.
