1999_April 5 

Forget the special effects ... Didn't anyone catch the whole hero/messiah
saga going on?  The little &quot;Neo is Jesus&quot; subtext?  While most of the
audience seemed hypnotized by the glim and glam of super slo-mo bullets and
Mortal Kombat combat sequences, the (not really all that) subtle narrative
structure harkens to those of antiquity.  From the drafting of Neo by
&quot;Morpheus the Baptist&quot; and his subsequent awakening (complete with
flittering dove) to his suffering, death, resurrection, and -- yes --
ascension, this is the Jesus story retold with high speed film and a bitchin
wardrobe.  And the moral to the story?  Humanity needs to find a cure to
itself before we evolve ourselves out of reality ...  not too far off from
the original.  Watch this movie with an eye for content, not Kung Fu.
