2000_January 7 

I used to think that there would never be a film that would leave me so
completely overwhelmed and astonished on so many levels as a good novel
could.  No other movie can compare to such books as Sphere and The Hobbit.
However when I saw the Matrix this belief was instantly quashed.  It is
amazing in so many ways that my comments could not possibly do justice to
it.  I guess I'll start with the obvious.  The special effects.  These are
the most apparent on the first look.  All I can say to describe them is:
&quot;WOW!&quot;  The effects range from realistic explosions to surrealistic,
futuristic slow motion types of effects that create a feeling of
excruciating suspense while also pumping out fast paced action!  And what
action.  The actions scenes aren't those dull car chases and pointless
shootouts that turn me of 99% of action movies.  The action in this movies
has never been seen before.  Sure there is a &quot;gunfight&quot; but it isn't like
any gunfight EVER done before.  I'm not a big action fan because I find
action movies repetitive.  But the Matrix is anything but.  Whether your
John Q. Action or a despiser of action movies you'll probably be on the
edge
of your seat.  The next place that this film scores is in the
philosophical
and dramatic areas.  Many action movies are devoid of such sensibilities
but
the Matrix scores a direct hit.  It is amazing to me how a movie can
incorporate such intellligent themes into an action environment without
dragging on.  The Matrix is NEVER boring, even if your looking for a pure
action movie, and yet it encorporates so much higher thought that the
actions seems to be only secondary.  Finally: the biblical alusion.  Well,
when this was first suggested to me I thought it was just some crazy
freaks
looking for biblical allusion and finding it because they wanted to.  Boy
was I wrong.  The Matrix has biblical allusion out the wazoo!  You can
believe me because I'm a registered skeptic, and if I think there is
biblical allusion, there is biblical allusion.  I'll let you all figure it
out for yourselves, but for all you Christians out there, the many
references to the bible make this phenominal movie even better.  In all
this
film is so unbelievably good that I had to put it at the top of my list as
the best movie ever made.  If you like action, drama, sci-fi(by the way
this
movie IS NOT science fiction, at least not in the traditional sense), or
movies that make you think the Matrix is for you.  It is a very
intelligent,
thought provoking action movie with many Christian overtones.  You should
absolutely, without-a-doubt see this movie.  You will not regret
it!
