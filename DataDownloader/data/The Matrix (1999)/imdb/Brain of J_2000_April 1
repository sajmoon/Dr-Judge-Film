Just saw it again for the first time since the original theatrical release.
I guess the Oscar hype and whatnot got me thinking about it again. Man,
those were some crazy special effects. It seems to me that if they are going
ahead and making it into a trilogy, then this may become the Star Wars of
the techie universe.<br /><br />Good fun.
