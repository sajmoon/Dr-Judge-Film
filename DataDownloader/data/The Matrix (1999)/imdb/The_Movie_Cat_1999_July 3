1999_July 3 

In 1976 the English tv series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; featured a collective of
unconscious thought as part of a computerised reality called &quot;The Matrix&quot;
in
a story called &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. I just thought I'd mention it.
Because
that, like the BLATANT product placement for Nokia (including the
slow-motion falling mobile phone)is one of the detracting elements from
the
movie.
But, of course, the biggest detraction is, ironically, the praise. For,
when
you're about to watch a movie that has five-star reviews in every
publication, and has entered the IMDb top 20, then actually seeing it is
bound to be an anti-climax. Even Citizen Kane didn't grab me the first
time
round due to this effect.
Yet having said all that, The Matrix IS a good movie - I gave it seven out
of ten. Maybe I'm weird, but the film contained no concept or twist that I
haven't already thought of, no surprise twist, nothing I didn't expect.
Why do all Hollywood films need to contain at least one
scene where characters do a &quot;humourous&quot; double-take? Lastly, the moral at
the end was forcing it down the viewer's throat and a slight to the
intelligence, but these were the only truly jarring points.
The characters were refreshing three, or at least two-dimensional, with
only
a couple of the cast there as the &quot;destined to be cannon fodder&quot; variety.
Direction and lighting is excellent throughout, if a little showy, and the
structure is maintained well. For a film that is roughly one hour
exposition, one hour pure action, it holds together very well. But does
this really deserve to dent the top twenty when
Twelve Monkeys is (at date of writing) outside the top
250?
