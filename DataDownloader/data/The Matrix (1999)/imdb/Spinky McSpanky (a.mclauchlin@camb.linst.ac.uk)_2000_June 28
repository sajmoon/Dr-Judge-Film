...so I maybe missed the good bits. All I do remember is that the action
sequences I so eagerly awaited from the trailer all happened in the last
five minutes and I couldn't give two hoots about the complicated dialogue
(If you are going to 'invent' a scenario such as this (&quot;But it could be
true!&quot;, I hear the geeks cry) as least make it interesting! Stop spouting
nonsensical tripe to fill up the speaking quota of the film). The effects
really got on my nerves. Why even bother the 3D rotation sequences - they
served no purpose. Why slow Keanu Reeves down to demonstrate how quickly he
could move? Just make him move quickly.<br /><br />The subject of other wordly forces manipulating our brains, and one man's
struggle against them, was covered more successfully in 'Dark City' - a far
superior film in style and entertainment.
