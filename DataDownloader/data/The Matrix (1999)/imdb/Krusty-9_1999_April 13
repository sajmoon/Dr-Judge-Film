1999_April 13 

Forget &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, a film that exploited the lovable talents of Jackie Chan
to promote the unforgivably irritating Chris Tucker.  Don't even look at
&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, which could have been the death Knell for the wonderful
Jet Li's career had it not done so well in the box office.  THE Martial Arts
mobie to see in 1999 (besides the upcoming &quot;PHANTOM MENACE&quot;) is &quot;The
Matrix.&quot;  Kudos once again to action choreography master Yuen Woo Ping (who
worked with Jet Li in &quot;ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA&quot;, A MASTERPIECE).  Mr Yuen
weaves a tapestry of white hot intensity as in all of his Hong Kong efforts.
Nobody in the Matrix merely punches or kicks; Under Mr Yuen's direction,
the cast dodges, flips, run up walls, evade, block, leap and deliver
shattering multiple blows, all with consideration to the surrounding
architecture.  Mr Yuen's work is further enhanced by the seamlessly
integrated computer imagery which made the confrontations of the heroes
(and villains) into nothing short of a superhuman clash of titans.  Don't
work with Van Damn, Mr Yuen!! Work with Jet in Star Wars II.  Keep up the
good work!!
