Good Characters, Good Music, Extraordinary Effects...With a plot far more
better than this Cliche (May be with a little more philosophic attitude
towards world, human beings, existence and the MATRIX rather than raw
action) would be the best SCI-Fi movie of 90's. After all I can't stop
admiring Audio/Visual effects...Highly Recommended for a Sci-Fi lover with
a
taste of high tempo and happy end.
