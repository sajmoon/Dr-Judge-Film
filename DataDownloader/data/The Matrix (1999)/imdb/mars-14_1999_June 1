Excellent moviemaking - packs quite a punch. Just the right blend of
visuals
and story. The plot leans quite heavily on William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot;
(how come that never made it to the big screen?). You get swept away by
the
visuals and concept of the plot to the point where you don't notice the
obvious holes in the plot until the ride is over. Yes, the ideas are not
new
- standard Sci-Fi theme - but they have never been presented better. The
Movie does leave you wanting more - more plot, more effects - so that's
why
you'll go and see it again.
Good work guy!
