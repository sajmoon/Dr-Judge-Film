The Matrix looks great. And no one really goes to a Keanu Reeves movie (or
a
Van Damme or Segall film) for a thought provoking plot do
they?
The Matrix is pleasing eye candy, and should do well on video (where you
can turn the sound down &amp; just enjoy the images).
As for the plot... don't settle for &quot;Gibson-lite&quot; when you can go to a
bookstore and pick up Neuromancer &amp; it's two &quot;sequels&quot;.
The Matrix may be better suited for Playstation than the cineplex, but
it's fun to watch.
