1999_April 14 

For the first time in a long while a movie was made with thought.  A movie
that made you think, and having to see it twice to get the whole
picture.<br /><br />The special effects were outstanding, along with the cinematography and
direction.  This movie was made with care...a 2.5 hour sci fi, kung fu,
love
story, that had everything for everyone.<br /><br />I am so glad someone is making real movies out there again, not like
&quot;Armageddon&quot;...a movie for the &quot;short attention span-mtv video edit
generation&quot;.<br /><br />My score a 10 out of 10. Awesome!
