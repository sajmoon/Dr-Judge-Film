I am not a big Sci-fi fan but I was blown away when I seen this film. I just
hope when they make parts 2 and 3 they can make it just as great! Keanu
Reeves doesn't make a lot of movies (Smart move on turning down Speed 2) but
when he does they are really good! The one thing I couldn't stop thinking of
was how much more I liked the special effects in The Matrix then Star Wars
episode 1.
