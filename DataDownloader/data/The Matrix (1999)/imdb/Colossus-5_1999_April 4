1999_April 4 

I thought the movie to be very entertaining, but see it for what it is. You
aren't going to be emotionally moved by it. It's rather a gun-toting special
effects monster. Keanu Reeves was a bit of a disappointment.  The plot was
familiar, the evil artificial intelligence vs. the humans, but original in
its own way. Up until the final bit of cheesiness at the end, I enjoyed it
the whole way through.
