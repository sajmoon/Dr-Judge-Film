1999_June 12 

Watching this film was, for me, like watching Terminator 2 for the first
time: exhilarating, gripping and visually stunning.  I rate the plot,
effects, and action sequences as ten out of ten, but it was let down by
some
clunky dialogue and over-mysterious characterisation.<br /><br />Don't let that put you off, however, as this is a must-see film, just like
T2, and the dialogue, while a little long-winded, does make the tortuous
plot simple to grasp.  I loved it, anyway!<br /><br />Is this the future of the action movie?<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />
