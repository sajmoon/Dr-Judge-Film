1999_April 4 

The above is not just repetition of its own sake, I HAVE seen this film
three times in three days. If you haven't rented any of the last year's
sci-fi flicks (Lost in Space, Deep Impact, Godzilla, Armageddon), better do
it now because after seeing The Matrix they'll look like s**t (Godzilla
looks like it anyway, but...).<br /><br />As any friend can attest, I see a lot of films. I have my own laser disc home
theater. I haven't been tempted to see a film twice in the theater since...
I think Speed, and that was on account of a girlfriend wanting to see it (no
huge Keanu Reeves fan either). Before that I think was T2.<br /><br />This isn't a review and don't read any comments that are. This sucker does
have a story (if maybe a little too thick for older film critics to
understand, same as their VCRs) that is spoiled by too much foreknowledge.
The rest of its elements (design, cinematography, acting, visual &amp; physical
effects, sound, soundtrack, casting, editing, direction) were approached
with an absolute love of craft. It might not be a film for all tastes, but
for a film lover it is one of the tastiest surprises since John Woo/Hong
Kong cinema.<br /><br />If The Phantom Menace is this year's main course, film lovers please help
yourselves to the appetizer. 'Cause, baby, this film rocks!
