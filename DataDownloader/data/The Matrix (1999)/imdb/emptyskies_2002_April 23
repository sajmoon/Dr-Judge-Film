The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a
brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is
excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu
is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly
inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this
movie!<br /><br />It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the
end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of
sequels
on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for
it.<br /><br />Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many
different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new...
this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read
a
number of definitive works (Simulation &amp; Simulcra was one I believe) in
modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects
of
the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not
ever.<br /><br />I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to
watch on a good cinema system, too.
