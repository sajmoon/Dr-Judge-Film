1999_December 26 

The action in this movie is obviously the best thing about it, and it works
very well, but the rest of the movie is just crap.  Acting is horrible,
could it be possible that Keanu Reeves is an even worse 'actor' than
Schwarzenegger? Yes. As far as plot goes, don't listen to anyone who calls
this movie 'thought-provoking,'.  If you really want to see
thought-provoking, go see &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  &quot;The Matrix&quot;'s plot is just a
cheap
excuse for the action.
