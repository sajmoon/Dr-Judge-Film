2003_January 27 

I think this is a nice little action movie that I would like a lot better
if
it had not developed a following that goes on and on about the movie's
supposed originality and profoundity (and who refer to the movie's
critics,
derogatorily, as &quot;intellectuals,&quot; which is kind of funny). Well, it is
entertaining, but it is not profound and it is certainly not original.
Even
someone like me, who has read some sci-fi but not a lot, can quote a few
examples in which every single allegedly original or profound aspect of
the
movie has already been written by some sci-fi author. Let's see: we have a
computer-generated world designed to keep a person entertained (so to
speak)
in Philip K' Dick's &quot;I Hope We Will Arrive Soon;&quot; we have a
computer-generated world created to fool people into believing they are
living in a fictituous world, while they are lying immobile in pods...
millions of them, in &quot;The Angel of Violence&quot; by Adam Wisniewski-Snerg; we
have a false world, this time drug-inspired, crated to mask the unbearable
reality of a devastated world, AND the use of a pill to &quot;lift the veil&quot;
and
see the world as it is, in &quot;The Futurological Congress,&quot; by Stanislaw Lem.
And I'm not going to mention the overuse of technology that renders humans
helpless... that one was already in H.G.Wells and E.M.Forster. Now, nobody
would be able to make a movie out of any of these very fine works, without
some idiot piping up &quot;Oh, just like in Matrix!&quot; In fact, you cannot do
anything about virtual reality without the Matrix comparison, which was
already been made about things as diverse as &quot;eXistenZ&quot; and &quot;Open Your
Eyes.&quot;<br /><br />And, and then there are all the philosophical concepts the movie filches
from diverse religions and philosophical sources; I suppose this works for
some people, but I don't enjoy my philosophy or religion dumbed-down and
sugarcoated in a `Kung Fu' setup. About the thing about Neo being an
equivalent of Jesus Christ, I'll give the moviemakers some credit and take
for granted that they didn't intend it, because it is so unflattering.
Neo's
character as `the chosen one' does not include a high degree of
intelligence
or awareness, but merely his ability to move very fast and dodge
bullets.
