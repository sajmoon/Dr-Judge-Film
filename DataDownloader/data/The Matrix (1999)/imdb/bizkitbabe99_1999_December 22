After seeing advertisements for &quot;The Matrix&quot;, I thought, &quot;TOTAL guy movie.&quot;
But after hours of pestering and tormenting from my older brother, I sat
down to watch it. Yes, it was a &quot;guy movie&quot; but it was very girl friendly.
Here's why: 1.) Keanu Reeves. enough said. 2.)Trinity has to be one of the
coolest female characters I've ever seen. 3.) Well, the movie just rocks.
But you have to really pay attention to understand it. This isn't a movie
that you can get up and go to the bathroom or get a snack
during. If you miss a minute, you'll be lost. My mom fell asleep and missed
five minutes, and she was confused. If you like action, and you know you'll
be able to stay awake, and duty doesn't call, this is a must see.
