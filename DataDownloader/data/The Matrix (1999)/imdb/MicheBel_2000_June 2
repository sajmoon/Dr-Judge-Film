I can't remember the last movie that I saw in the theatre seven times. I
just couldn't get enough of The Matrix. Still can't (I just caught it again
on cable). It's got everything: cool sci-fi techo storyline, a love story,
lots of slam-bang action scenes, great martial arts, wonderful actors,
visuals to die for, fabulous Chicago brothers who directed...In short,
everything you could ask for in a movie.<br /><br />But the best thing, for me, is how spiritual the movie really is. I'll never
forget sitting in a huge packed theatre, with the entire audience SILENT,
struggling to get the concepts being thrown at them between high kicks.
There is a reason why this movie kicked Phantom Menace's butt at the Academy
Awards this year. And it's not just because of the amazing visuals. It's
because the STORY of The Matrix was everything we used to go to Star Wars
for: the good guys winning, the connection with the Force, it's all there,
and in a very 90s/new millennium way.<br /><br />God, I just LOVED this movie! See it, if you haven't already.
