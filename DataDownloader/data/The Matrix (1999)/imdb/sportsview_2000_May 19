The Matrix is a movie of utter brilliance. The storyline hits you like a
blow to the head... could this world ever form into reality, a real eye
opener. The Wachowski brothers with the aid of phenomenal visual effects
create a movie which will revolutionize the sci-fi movie industry, a must
see movie!<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne(Morpheus) plays his character to a tee. The cool,
aggressive and serious leader of the resistance has us at one moment at a
sense of ease, the next, a rush of sheer fast flowing adrenaline streams our
bodies.
