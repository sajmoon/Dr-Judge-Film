This is one of the films everyone copies ,talks about and model and
compare themselves to !!!Every couple of years a movie come out that
catches
the imagination and attention of the public(STAR WARS,PULP FICTION
,TITANIC,ET,BRAVEHEART,JURASSIC PARK ETC,TERMINATOR 2,LION KING ,TOY STORY
ETC...)Though they might be in different genres but bring an original
concept and strike a chord with the audience! That is what The Matrix has
done!!It is a breathtaking ride into visual and groundbreaking new
territory, it has revolutionized and influenced a lot of new movies and
with
good reason!!It is a smart thinking man 's movie with smart characters and
brilliant action sequences that leave you stunned!! IT is movie you must
see
on a big screen to catch the full effect with a kick@ss music score!! It
is
a cool sleak movie with John Wooish flair and visual &quot;eyecandy&quot;
photography!! I personally enjoy stylish all out action movies or smart
well written movies with heavy character developement and an intriguing
storyline that maintain your interest and challenge your mind!!
Unfortunately you very rarely find them both in the same film!! That is
why
I found this movie so entertaining it delivered on both counts
,brilliantly
acted by everyone even Keanu ( yeah Keanu who would have thought totally
caught me off guard!!!!) Anyways this is a must see movie that exceeds all
the hype, most movies fall way short of their hype this one totally
surpasses it!!!!
