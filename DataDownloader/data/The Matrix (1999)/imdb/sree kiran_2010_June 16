the matrix is a movie that has a story that is not possible. so before
one sits to watch the movie. its better that they free their minds. do
not think too deep. the movie has a computer based - machine based
concept. the concept is not utilized to full extent. the action scenes
drives the movie. the visual effects and the training scenes are top
notch. so when one decides that matrix is a imaginary movie. definitely
it is . so just watch the movie for action sequences and
cinematography. cast wise performance neo ( keanu reeves ) is good and
suitable. lawrence fishburne ( morpheus ) and carrie anne moss (trinity
) are good enough. rest all did a perfect job. final verdict: see and
forget it.
