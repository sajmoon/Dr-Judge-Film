1999_June 14 

Yes, The Matrix is a great film. It's tightly edited and the action rarely
flags. However, all this semi-mystical nonsense about the
&quot;incomprehensibility&quot; of the plot is overblown. In essence, it's the same
plot as last year's woefully neglected Dark City. Just replace shiny 1990s
pseudo-city with dark gothic 1920s pseudo-city (and robots with aliens)
and
voila! And the lauded kung-fu scenes put me very much in mind of 1995's
Mortal Kombat.
