1999_November 14 

I refused to watch this for the simple reason that the trailers had Keanu do
his best &quot;woah&quot; since Bill and Ted's repeat adventures with Death.<br /><br />BUT - time to eat humble pie. After being made to watch it by my best
friend, I could only sit open mouthed at the ingenuity and imagination that
produced such an amazing piece.  The effects are obviously what makes this
film, but I'd watch it again just for them. Truly outstanding.<br /><br />Marks off for having the audacity to put a love angle in though. Totally
unnecessary.
