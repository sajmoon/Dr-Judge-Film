1999_April 5 

I have to say, this was one of the most intricate movie plots that I have
ever seen, but I liked it because it was different.  The special effects
are
amazing.  The &quot;Bullet Time&quot; thing was really cool. (it took 2 years to
perfect!)  Keanu Reeves was pretty good, and Carrie-Anne Moss looked
awesome
in that black outfit!  Laurence Fishburne did great playing Morpheus.  I
recommend this movie to anyone!  10/10
