&quot;The Matrix&quot; is an absolute thrill-a-minute ride with a twist: there's a
plot and some depth behind the superb special effects.  The film is highly
entertaining, provocative, is generally well-acted (Reeves does a great job
UNDERPLAYING his role here), and it boasts a terrific villain in &quot;Mr.
Smith,&quot; whose monotone barely disguises his loathing for humans.  The
producer of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; should take note of the use and quality of
the fx here, and perhaps get a clue for his next film.  In particular, the
martial arts scene with Fishburne and Keanu is not new, but is sharp and
nicely integrated into the plot.<br /><br />My main issues with the film (as also noted by Roger Ebert) are that it has
a partially derivative screenplay (see &quot;Dark City,&quot; the writings of Philip
Farmer and Harlan Ellison, and certain stock action films), and that the
climax, while exciting, is predictable and well-worn, and implies that the
screenwriters and story editors simply ran out of ideas.  This leaves the
viewer unsatisfied with the traditional &quot;good guy v. bad guy&quot; fight that
leaves the intellectual issues raised earlier unresolved.  That said, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; is great entertainment and a definite &quot;big screen&quot; film.  An &quot;8.&quot;<br /><br />
