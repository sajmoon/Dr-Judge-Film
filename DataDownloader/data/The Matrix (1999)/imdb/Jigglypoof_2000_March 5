  Again, like with the Blair Witch Project, I ventured to watch this film as
I was told there wasn't any gory violence.<br /><br />  I won't deny that the special effects are outstanding.<br /><br />  However, I am not generally a fan of these, &quot;the world isn't real&quot; movies,
e.g The Truman Show, etc. as I am quite impressionable, so this film may be
good for some people and not others.  <br /><br />  Yes, I know that it's a fictional story.  I'm just not a fan of films that
mess with your head for a while after you watch the film.  This one wasn't
too bad but it makes you think.<br /><br />  So, I would recommend it for people who can check their reality at the
door.  I prefer something a little lighter, but it is an excellent film for
those who aren't impressionable like me.
