The Matrix is a very good movie with a great premise.<br /><br />It is well written, and well acted and there aren't any holes in the plot
(as is usually the case in action/fantasy genre).  The kiss scene is the
only shadow on an otherwise realistic film.<br /><br />I wasn't a Keanu Reeves fan before watching this movie, and I'm still not,
but he pulled off a convincing performance in The Matrix.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful, and must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Overall, the premise, plot, and special effects is what made this movie so
good.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was a Matrix 2 -- but I hope that
they don't call it that.<br /><br />9/10
