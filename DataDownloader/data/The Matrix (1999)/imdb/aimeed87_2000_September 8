But,if violence can be well-handled, this movie did it.  It won me over to
the genre.  I have since watched the Terminators and Lethal Weapons, etc.
This movie was such an extraordinary work it broke through years of
resistance!  I have watched it over and over - great storyline, great
storytelling, extraordinary special effects - perfect casting. All acting
was top-notch and Keanu Reeves was completely charismatic - something I had
never felt from him as an actor before.  I rate it 10/10.
