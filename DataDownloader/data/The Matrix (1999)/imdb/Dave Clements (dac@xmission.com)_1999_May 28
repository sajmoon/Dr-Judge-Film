1999_May 28 

This movie was a total surprise for me and my friends.  Being comic book
fans we noticed immediately that the plot and action were written in a
mature adaptation of the comic book genre.  We were very pleased with the
overall plot layout and premise as well as the extraordinary visuals and
effects.  One of the best movies i have ever seen.
