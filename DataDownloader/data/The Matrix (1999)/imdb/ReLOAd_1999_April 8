1999_April 8 

The Matrix was a visual and aural assault on the senses. Everyone keeps on
talking about the new standard of Hollywood films that a movie such as
this
and Dark City establish. Has the definition of a Hollywood Film now
altered
and a Film no longer needs to made in Hollywood or have a Hollywood
production crew to be deemed a Hollywood blockbuster? For the people who
have been attempting to figure which city in America, The Matrix was
filmed
in, it was in fact filmed in Sydney Australia, my home town, and a
subtantial portion of the production and post-production crew are Aussies
(as was Dark City). D-Film, responsible for the FX that everyone is
ranting
about are a Sydney company.<br /><br />I'm going to see it again, I think on some mind and consciousness
expanding
substance...the experience will be worth it!
