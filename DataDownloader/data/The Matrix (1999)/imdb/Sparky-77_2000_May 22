I found this movie intriguing from the start.  Spectacular effects,
especially in fight scenes, and outstanding story line that kept me
thinking
about conversations I had in college about &quot;one consciousness&quot;.  Not a ten
due to the over the top harvesting footage and I still find myself waiting
for an &quot;Excellent&quot; to be uttered by Reeves.
