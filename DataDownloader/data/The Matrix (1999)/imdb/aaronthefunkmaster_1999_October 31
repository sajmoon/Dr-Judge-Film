1999_October 31 

As a student at NYU I come into contact with many film students and film
aficionados. When I first came here this fall I kept being told by these
people that The Matrix was the best film of the year and maybe the greatest
movie of all time. I finally saw it about a month ago and was pretty
dissappointed. There were some cool fight scenes and above average action,
but other than that? I kept being told the Matrix had this whole
&quot;philosophy.&quot; Are you kidding me? It was just a simple sci-fi story line.
There was no &quot;philosophy,&quot; it has no meaning for life and anyone who thinks
it does is as blind to reality as those living their lives in the
Matrix.
