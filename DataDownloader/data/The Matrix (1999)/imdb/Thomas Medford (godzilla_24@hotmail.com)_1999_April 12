&quot;The Matrix&quot; is, without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made.
Everything about this film is remarkable: the script, the acting, and, of
course, the special effects.  This movie has the most mind blowing visuals
that you have to see to believe.  They are simply breath taking.  The plot
of this film is unlike no other.  It's the most original movie ever made,
and also, the most thought provoking.  You will leave the theater wondering
if something like this could ever happen.  Or is already
happening....
Do not wait for this movie on video.  See it at the theater while you
can!!!
