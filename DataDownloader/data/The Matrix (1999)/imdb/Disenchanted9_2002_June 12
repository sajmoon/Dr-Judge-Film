&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a poorly written and directed film that rips off the
much better &quot;Dark City.&quot; <br /><br />This film certainly is not among the top 100 films of the 1990s, let
alone should be ranked 40th as it is at IMDB.com.<br /><br />The script is poor as the writer and director did a poor job stealing
parts from other films.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves performance is poor, which is to be expected as
his performances usually are.<br /><br />Besides the special effects, Laurence Fishburne and Joe
Pantoliano were bright spots in the film as they give good
performances, especially considering the poor script, direction
and acting from those around them.
