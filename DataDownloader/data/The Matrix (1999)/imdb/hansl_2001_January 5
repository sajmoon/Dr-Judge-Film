I can almost feel these highly capable filmmakers think : what a marvellous
concept to make a film from. Virtual existence.
But where does that leave me as viewer. Should I marvell at the special
effects and the overall visual aspects of the movie? Should I see it as
unpretentious entertainment (like wonderfull 'the Mummy')?
No, because everyone is talking ssso ssserious all the time. And all sort of
life philosophy stuff is thrown to my head.
Should I see it as a timeless peace of art (like say a
'Kubrick')?
Hahaha. Well it's a pity the life philosophy bits don't go beyond puberty
stage then.
So i'm left with nothing but marvellous visuals with a dirty tang and thus a
mediocre viewing experience.
