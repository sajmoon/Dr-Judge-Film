1999_April 4 

Strange as it seems, I went to his movie wanting desperately to NOT like it
because I knew it would be wildly popular and occasionally, I like to swim
downstream when everyone else chooses upstream. Or is it the opposite of
that,  and where did that saying come from anyway? Was it just programmed
into our psyche at birth? Strange. This movie was incredible, not only was
it visually a treat but it also explains, to my satisfaction,  some
mysteries of life, such as that whole &quot;deja vu&quot; thing.<br /><br />I liked the fact that I wasn't really sure who the good guys and the bad
guys were for about the first 40 minutes.<br /><br />The humor was subtle and very dry. There was one cliched line of humor but
it was placed so well that I didn't mind it and, in fact, found it to
slightly relieve some tension-watch for the line, &quot;the door on your left, no
your other left.&quot;<br /><br />Keanu was great. His facial expressions made me believe. He can speak
volumes with just his expressions and two simple words like &quot;whoa&quot; and
&quot;okie dokie.&quot; His progressive attitude change, as he learns more and more
about the Matrix and his role in it, is exquisitely believable, and then
when he finally sees the Matrix for what it is, you just know that you would
follow him anywhere.<br /><br />As far as fashion goes, check out the footwear. Everybody has just great
footwear. Don't put away your black clothes for summer, especially those
long black coats, they look great when you're doing those anti-gravity
cartwheels. Those sunglasses will also be a &quot;must have&quot; item for all of you
swimming with the crowd.<br /><br />One final question, &quot;How DOES Morpheus keep those sunglasses
on?&quot;<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for a complete escape from your cares. It is
also a repeater. I saw it twice, and am planning to go at least once more &#150;
so be sure to hit the matinee, they're cheaper, and you WILL want to see
this movie again. Also, I don't know if there are plans for a sequel, but I
would go, and go and go...
