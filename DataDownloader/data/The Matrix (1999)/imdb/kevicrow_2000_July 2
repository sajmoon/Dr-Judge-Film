The Matrix is not just merely a movie but more of an awe-inspiring
audio-visual experience that has to be seen to be believed.
It focuses on the character of Thomas Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves, in
his best role since Speed) who begins to question the nature of the world
around him, thus leading him to a mysterious figure named Morpheus, who
holds the answer to the question: &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;.
Boasting mind-boggling special effects, some of the most adrenaline-pumping
action sequences ever committed to film and an ingenious storyline, The
Matrix is arguably one of the best Science Fiction movies ever made. It
stands up to multiple viewings, and has to be seen at least a second time
to
be fully appreciated. Strong support from an excellent cast- most notably
Laurence Fishbourne as Morpheus further add to the quality of this modern
classic. Millions of fans around the world now await the coming Matrix
sequels with great anticipation...
