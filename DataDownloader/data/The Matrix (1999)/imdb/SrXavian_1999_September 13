1999_September 13 

This movie has crossed the bridge from Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk to mainstream, and
aside from expecting an &quot;Excellent, Dude!&quot; line here and there.. it was
AWESOME!!  Give me MORE... hackers was a joke.  Jonny Mnemonic was an excuse
to get a rapper into acting.. but this.... this was NEW.
