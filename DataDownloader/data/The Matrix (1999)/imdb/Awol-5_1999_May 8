1999_May 8 

Take...<br /><br />John Woo slo-mo, dual pistol scenes
Total Recall, Truman Show, Dark City alternate reality
theme.
Lost in Space, Armageddon-like special effects.
Blade Runner-like philosophy.
&quot;Subtle&quot; sunglasses, mobile phone advertising.<br /><br />Stir well, add a touch of cheese(iness), hype, shoddy acting, appalling
dialogue, LOTS of guns and you have the Matrix. A mediocre rip-off of many
great films out today.<br /><br />Not only did this movie borrow elements from other flicks, but it also
tried
to blow them out of proportion. Slo-mos were used to the point of
absurdity
and the one scene which I found remotely interesting was the
freeze-photography shot in the simulation...which had already been done in
Lost In Space. This movie had enough guns to start an arms dealing ring
and
so many plot holes it could masquerade as a flyscreen door. To classify
The
Matrix as a sci-fi movie is a total joke. And as an action movie, it's
over-hyped, over-budgeted and over-the-top.<br /><br />All my friends seemed to like this movie...am I the only one who can spot
its faults?!?
