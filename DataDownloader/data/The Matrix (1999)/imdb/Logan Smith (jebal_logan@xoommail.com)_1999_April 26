1999_April 26 

Yes, as it has been said, the special effects were wonderful in this movie.
But also it must be said that this isn't just a treat for the eye to see;
The Matrix, the first of an intended trilogy, is a potential concept that
messes with your mind in a way no other movie has yet, in my opinion, been
capable of.  The scientific possibilities presented in Jurassic Park, for
example, are nothing compared with this, and the dark future lying in wait
for the human race could be out there.  I shudder to think of it, as this
brilliant movie makes it so real in its presentation of our blinded world.
It's as Morpheus says:  &quot;No one can be told what the Matrix is; you have to
see it for yourself.&quot;
