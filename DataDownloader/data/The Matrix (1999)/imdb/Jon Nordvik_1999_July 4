1999_July 4 

I side with the negative crowd on this one; with the risk of sounding
pompous I have to say this: To believe that this is a brilliant film
suggest
a low level of education and an underdeveloped personal philosophy. There,
I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old
Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old
Star
Trek episode &quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot; in 1969. The rest of the film is an
obvious rip-off of &quot;The Terminator&quot; and all of John Woo, which are far more
interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and
there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still,
overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne
makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the
trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and
feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did. The whole
thing just isn't half as clever and original as it wants to
be.
