This movie, I thought kicked!  I mean, the ending did seem like a
cliff-hanger, and it did definitely leave you hanging.  But then I found
out
that this has the possibility of being a trilogy if it does well.  It had
better be a trilogy! So go out and see it!  Quickly, it is a great movie
and
all action/sci-fi lovers will love this flick.  Any movie lover/buff (like
me) will love this movie!
