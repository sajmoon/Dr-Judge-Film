I must say that it deserves to be the movie of the year 1999, cause it has
all kind of computer action, and specially the bullet dodging scene of
Keanu
Reeves was really awesome. It's got a cool soundtrack, with actors more
awesome. Although it's got a mysteriouse kind of an unbelieving story, but
when you watch it, you feel like you are in thje movie in reality. i must
advice the people who havent watched it , must see it, cause i've gotm it
in
my movie collection.
