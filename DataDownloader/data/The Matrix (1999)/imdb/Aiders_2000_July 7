In a vision of special effects, the Matrix delivers a punch in the realm
of
sci-fi. What Star Wars does for the effects, The Matrix delivers in
Premise.<br /><br />With a plot that on the surface is a kick ass action movie yet layered so
deep with cryptic pseudo-religious references, this flick is up there with
the big guys.<br /><br />As an action flick, The Matrix is only a 6.5, but as a statement of todays
Science-Fiction writers boundaries, this is a 9.5, a must see. Unless, of
course you don't like thinking while the blood is spilt.
