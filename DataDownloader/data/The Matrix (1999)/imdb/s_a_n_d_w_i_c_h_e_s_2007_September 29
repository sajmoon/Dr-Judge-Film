This movie is so cool you will think you have just come back from a
refreshing vacation in some place that you might like to go to
(wherever that may be). The film is so cool it doesn&#39;t even matter
where you have been on the vacation you will feel like you have just
had.<br /><br />This movie is all about the matrix, which I think is a place exactly
like the planet earth but only it&#39;s completely different and is
controlled by robots. I&#39;m not sure exactly what it is. The movie did
make me feel very discombobulated like an imbalance of apples and
oranges, but that doesn&#39;t matter because it had explosions and fighting
with punches and kicks LOL! This movie is so much fun to witness. It&#39;s
just so great that I can&#39;t even begin to tell you (although I have
already told you some things). If you like action that blows your
smackers you will not be disappointed.
