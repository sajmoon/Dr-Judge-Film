&quot;The Matrix&quot;, I believe, will come to be a masterpiece in the genre of
science fiction/special effects films.  So often these types of films either
forget that they need a plot, or the plot becomes lost in the process of
showing eye popping visual effects.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; does not have this
problem.  It has a complicated plot that twists back on itself and is
interesting.
In addition the movie maintains an intensity that really kept me on the edge
of my seat.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves (yes he was good in
this movie) all give excellent performances.  The visual effects are
incredible and yet not overstated.<br /><br />The best part of the movie for me was the fact that I had no clue as to the
plot.  This is the best way to go into this movie.  It will add to the
intensity and keep you guessing for much of the movie.  So if someone tries
to tell you anything about the plot, tell them to stop.  It may spoil some
of the surprises that lay in store for you if you see this
movie.
