1999_April 18 

This movie was a visual trip. It had some plot points I didn't like
very
much, but till I make my own movie, I guess I can't complain too much. The
story was well written and thought out, the special effects were
spectacular, and the cinematic style was cyberchic'. Cool looking People
doing Really cool things, to cool villians. I could see the word sequel
screaming at me as the last scene unfurled.
I'll stand in line to see the sequel too. Reeves is a wooden block, but
the other performances are good enough that you don't mind. The
anime-cum-Hong-Kong fight scenes are great too. Great movie, great time.
great trip.
