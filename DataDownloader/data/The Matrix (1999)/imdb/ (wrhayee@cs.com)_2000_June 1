Seeing this movie was like watching someone else play a video game:
after 10 minutes I wanted to either leave or play some myself. As a
matter of fact, the producers of this thing probably owe its popularity
to parents who dumped their kids in video parlors at malls instead of
sending them to school.<br /><br />I mean, even if you get past the impressive (for awhile, anyway)
whistles and buzzers, &quot;The Matrix&quot; pushes the envelope just an inch too
far when it asks us to believe Keanu Reeves' MIND is being sought to
SAVE THE WORLD! It's too funny for words. WHO could believe it?<br /><br />Well, I guess if you have never met anyone who actually HAD a mind you
MIGHT buy it. But, if that were the case, you probably wouldn't be
allowed to go out of the house alone to see &quot;The Matrix.&quot;
