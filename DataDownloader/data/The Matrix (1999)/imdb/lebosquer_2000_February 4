2000_February 4 

I love this movie.The special effects were amazing,it kept me fascinated
and
the cast did a magnificent job.I hate how I have read other peoples
comments
and they have said how badly Keanu Reeves acted.How could the say
that?Keanu
Reeves was a fantastic actor in the Matrix and always will be.Isn't it
hard
to believe that he is 35.He looks about 25 and I wish he was younger.He is
extremely beautiful.Anyway i'm getting off the subject.This movie is a
definite 10/10.I have seen it 6 times now and i'm aiming for 100! It is
fantastic.Terrific action scenes and fighting and it is spot on.I love
it.
