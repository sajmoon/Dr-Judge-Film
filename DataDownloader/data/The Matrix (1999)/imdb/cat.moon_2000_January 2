One question that will you will be asking yourselves throughout the movie
will be: What is the Matrix? I'm not here to tell you exactly what it is
(so
I don't know, but hey!) but I can tell you about what I mean by a &quot;New Race
of sci-fi film.&quot;<br /><br />First of all, let's talk about the beginning of the film. The chase scenes
in the beginning (Trinity, the police and the Agent) are worth paying for
the cinema ticket alone. The special &quot;Bullet Time&quot; effects could be the
very
tip of the iceberg which can unleash a whole new way of filming and camera
angles.<br /><br />The government Lobby scene and the Kung-Fu scene unite Western and Eastern
filming; all four leading characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Agent
Smith) trained for 5 months with a group of Hong Kong martial arts trainers
and wirestunt-stunt men to allow them to attain the &quot;natural&quot; grace and
ability of Kung-Fu. It's not about how well the actor/ress APPEARS to
fight,
it's about how well the actor/ress KNOWS how to fight. The Matrix could be
just the start of combining the talents of both Western and Eastern filming
tactics to make the perfect movie. And The Matrix is just
that.
