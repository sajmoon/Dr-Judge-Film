The Matrix is probably the most visually stunning film I have ever seen.
The fight scenes simply take your breath away, and leave you in a state of
wonder.  The slow-motion filming of the gun battle scenes is of first
class
proportion.  As stunning as this film is visually, the story is of the
highest class, spun out over two and a half hours or so, blending in
perfectly within the films context, that being action/sci-fi.  Despite the
complexity of the film, it was surprisingly easy to follow, the reason for
that fact lies in the majestic storytelling that is conjured within The
Matrix.  One word to describe this film would have to be awesome.  Don't
even think, just go see, and be amazed.  I promise you will not regret it.
The Matrix is an experience of film-making all of it's own, simply of a
different class.
