1999_April 21 

I don't have any flowery words or phrases to describe this movie, but just
one comment.  I usually go out for a smoke in the middle &quot;lull&quot; of a
movie.
This flick had me completely glued to my seat!  I was amazed at the great
story, pretty good acting, and special effects that cannot even be
properly
described.  It's plot was complex enough that it didn't spell everything
out
for you, but not so complex that it got confusing.  It was an awesome
flick!
Great entertainment...everyone should see it.
