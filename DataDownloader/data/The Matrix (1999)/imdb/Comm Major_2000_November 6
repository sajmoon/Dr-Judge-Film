And, wow!  Just as I was surfing the IMDb site, I wondered: &quot;What IS the
status for 'The Matrix 2'? And about the third, as well... Where are they
filming? Where....&quot;<br /><br />And low and behold... it came to me.  What if this whack-ass Matrix mindtrip
is only three to an enormous 9-episode venture similar to (HELLO!!!) 'Star
Wars'!<br /><br />My God!  Do you have any idea how insane that would be.  Okay, just a
thought.  Go back to your life now.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Comm Major
