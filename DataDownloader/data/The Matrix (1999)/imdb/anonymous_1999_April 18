1999_April 18 

I agree with another reviewer, Reeves was a great choice for Neo.  Overall
I
liked this movie a lot.  The special effects
were just stunning.<br /><br />But, when I left the theater my ears were actually hurting from the
volume.
I complained to the management and was told that the movie comes with a
recommended setting.  Hollywood listen up or all your movie goers are
gonna
be DEAF.<br /><br />I had read reviews of this movie prior to seeing it.  They spoke of
complex
plotting, a thinking man's action pic etc.. so maybe I was expecting to
much.  The plot was good but took no effort to follow and as typical of
summer action movies the action sequences toward the end just go on and on
and on and on and on......<br /><br />My rating for this movie is a 7.  My companion only gives it a
5.<br /><br />If you are going to see it definitely see it at a theater don't wait for
video
and take your ear plugs.
