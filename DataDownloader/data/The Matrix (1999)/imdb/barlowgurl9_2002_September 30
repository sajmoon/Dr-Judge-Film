There are so many comparisons between The Matrix and the story of Jesus
in
the Bible.
The most significant comparisions, I found was Morphius compared to John
the
Baptist, when Neo dies and comes back to life with the ressurection of
Jesus, and finally the agents are like demons.
Morphius is like John the Baptist because Morphius' assignment is to find
&quot;the one&quot;.  John the Baptist was also supposed to prepare the world for
Jesus' coming.  In John 6-8 says:  &quot;There came a man sent from God, whose
name was John.  He came for a witness, that he might bear witness of the
light, that all might believe throuhg him.  He was not the light, but
came
that he might bear witness of the light.&quot;
When Neo gets shot about 10 times then comes back to life, that resembles
when Jesus got crucified and than rose again.  Mark 16:6
says:
&quot;And he said to them, 'Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the
Nazarene, who has been crucified.  He has risen; He is not here; behold,
here is the the place where they laid him.&quot;
All of the agents represent demons.  They overtake different peoples
lives
and destroy them.  They are all to get Neo, but deep down they are all
afraid of him.
