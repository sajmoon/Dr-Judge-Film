1999_September 25 

 This movie is mind-bending. It's mind-warped. It's mind-blowing. It's...
well it's this: Aliens+ The Terminator+ Star Wars+ comic books+ John Woo+
Anime, but, it's not just a plodded out re-hash of all these things. It's a
well-thought-out, well-constructed action/sci-fi cyberpunk epic with
fantastic visual sequences. It is the ultimate 90's movie-geek movie. 5/5
stars.
