The Matrix shows us a set of nice effects. That's all, I'm afraid. When I
walked out of the cinema I had already forgotten almost everything I had
seen in the film.<br /><br />To me The Matrix is just a lot of graphic computer effects with a bunch of
noise. In too many scenes, the actors don't act: they just show manners or
an attitude!
