1999_November 29 

I have seen this movie more than three times now and I'm planning to buy
the
video (and you have to believe me: I don't buy many videos,but I'm willing
to make an exception for &quot;The Matrix&quot; ). In my eyes, this movie is the
ULTIMATE S-F movie ! It has everything a good movie needs: EXCELLENT,
REMARKABLE plot, special effects, action scenes, drama...<br /><br />This movie is a real mindjob....<br /><br />I don't understand why this movie has not got more attention. It is WAY WAY
better then the new Star Wars !!!
