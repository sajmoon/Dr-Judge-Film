only some right wing religious nut would think that this movie has anything
to do with christianity....because there is some powerful force that
controls us in the movie, you people automatically believe this has
something to do with christianity? Well, i pose a very different
theory....if anything this movie is anti christian, considering that neo and
his crew is fighting this matrix or controlling force trying to bring it
down to bring humanity its freedom that they never had to begin with. It
maybe possibly the greatest science fiction movie ever made and I think it
is a shame that another religion can take over somebody's opinion on a
masterpiece of artwork such as this...
