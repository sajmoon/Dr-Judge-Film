1999_August 12 

Years ago when I first read William Gibson's Neuromancer I had an image of
what it would be like but I didn't think at that time that I would ever see
it realised on film. But here is a film that does just that. I don't mean
that it replicates Gibson's vision, more that it conveys visually an
environment like that that first described so graphically by Gibson, with a
similar noirish darkness. This is a movie to come back to. The sooner it is
available on video the better.
