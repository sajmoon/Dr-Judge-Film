1999_April 19 

While the trailer for The Matrix involves lots of violence, I was surprised
at how little there was in the actual film.  Also, most of what was there
was very plot-driven, not just for show.  Take the sparring match between
Neo and Morpheus.  The entire time they are fighting, Morpheus is trying to
teach Neo how to &quot;free his mind&quot;-it wasn't just a senseless confrontation
for the action fans to get all hyped-up about.  And when it didn't seem to
work, they didn't fight to a conclusion: it simply ended, right then and
there.  While I'll admit that the fight scenes where very good-especially
the slow-motion, camera angles, and emphasis on abstract things, like spent
shell casings-there was a decent plot behind it as well.  Overall it was a
good movie, one of the coolest looking films I've seen in a long time.
