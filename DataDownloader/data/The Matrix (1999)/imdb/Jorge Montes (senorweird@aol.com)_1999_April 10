1999_April 10 

I have never been so upset at myself for going to see a movie.  While the
movie had great effects, the story was horrible.  Sometimes, the plot was so
intolerable that I wanted to go to the bathroom just to get away from the
movie.  The only reason I stayed was to see if the ending would at least
have been decent.  *BZZZT*  Wrong!  It was the most contrived bit of malarky
I've ever seen.  Did I forget to mention that the acting was god awful.  A
word to the wise:  Only see this movie if you hate yourself.
