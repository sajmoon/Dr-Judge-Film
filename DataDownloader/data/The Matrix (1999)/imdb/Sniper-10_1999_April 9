The Matrix is the Best sci-fi movie I have ever seen. The special effects
in
this are so cool you won't ever see anything better. Keanu Reeves and
Laurence Fishburne in their best performances yet. The one bad thing is
that
most of the action is seen on TV. The plot and action are the most coolest
thing seen.
