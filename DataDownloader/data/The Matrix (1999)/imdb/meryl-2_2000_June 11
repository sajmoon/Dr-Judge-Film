The Matrix is just a totally CLASSIC film. The special effects are epic
enough to put this film into the history books. It's the fact that there's
actually a BRILLIANT story behind it too that makes me feel like this film
is really going to be looked on as a classic years from now. This film is
LOADED with symbolism and imagery and philosophy and sheer brilliance. This
film is WAY ahead of its time. And THIS one was on the first chapter in
what's got potential to be THE new great trilogy of our time. It's gonna be
OUR Star Wars people!!!  Check it owwwwwttt!!!<br /><br />
