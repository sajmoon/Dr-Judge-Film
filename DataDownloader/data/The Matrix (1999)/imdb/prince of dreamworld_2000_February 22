Well to talk about Matrix,its really difficult.I guess there are so many
dimensions in the film that its really hard to figure what the movie was
all
about.I think this is a masterpiece,the dialogues are excellent but might
be too hard for ordinary people to understand.The acting performnce is
very
good specially by Lawrance fishbourne and keanu reeves in fact the whole
crew has
done a great job.
There are so many aspects in the movie one of which I think is the
awareness
of what is our innerself and God.The movie changes its dimension when neo
meets morpheous and the turn is so fantasised that people would
think,whats
going on?I think the movie is very much a must see and those who havent
seen
it so far I think they have missed one of the great masterpieces of the
century.
