1999_April 5 

The Matrix represents the vision of so-called Generation X. We twenty and
thirty-somethings have, each one of us, walked the Cyper-path in its
earliest dust-covered incarnations, (even if that means we only dabbled
with
hallucinogens and techno-music), always dreaming of the time when
technology
would provide the world with the capability of *becoming* the video game.
This movie is Virtual Reality as Descartes and other 'brain in a vat'
enthusiasts would have it.  And the eye candy in this film
puts
Titanic to shame.
