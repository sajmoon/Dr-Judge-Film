I remember back in 1999, movie audiences were also treated to what is
by far the best science fiction film of the 1990's, The Wachowski
Brothers brilliant science fiction masterpiece, The Matrix.<br /><br />Now, I was a little sceptical at first of seeing the film, because I am
not a big fan of the below standard acting skills of the wooden Keanu
Reeves, however, after seeing the fantastic trailer, I knew I had to
see this film. WHAT CAN I SAY, The Matrix gave science fiction fans the
best script in nearly a decade, since 1991's Terminator 2, by combining
action, philosophy, and intelligence all tightly wrapped up with the
most state of the art special effects.<br /><br />No wonder The Matrix completely stole the thunder from The Phantom
Menace, it had originality, and some of the best action scenes ever put
on the big screen. A 10 on a scale of 1-10!
