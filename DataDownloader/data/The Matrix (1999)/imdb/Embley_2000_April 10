2000_April 10 

this movie utilized some of the greatest special effects seen in any film in
the last 10 years.  there were some awe-inspiring sequences. <br /><br />and for the most part i thought the characters and acting were very good -
with one exception of course.  keanu reeves is a bizarre phenomena.  he is a
terrible actor - at least at any character that requires any depth at all. 
he is fine in stuff like bill &amp; ted or point break.  i can't figure out what
it is that makes him so popular with the public.  i mean he is good looking
but i can't believe it goes THAT far!  if it does that is pathetic.  what am
i saying.  of course it goes that far and of course it is
pathetic.<br /><br />the plot of this film was very interesting but it was executed in a way that
was a little too comic book-ish for me.  other than these two things i
thought it was a greatly entertaining film which anyone who hasn't seen
should check out.
