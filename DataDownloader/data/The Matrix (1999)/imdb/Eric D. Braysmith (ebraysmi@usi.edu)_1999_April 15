<br /><br />Make no mistake; this slick, high-tech, bullet-spraying, kung-fu fighting
movie is actually a very serious religious allegory.  And while it is not
exactly a complete transcription of Christian beliefs, it's no small
coincidence that &quot;The Matrix&quot; opened up on Easter weekend.<br /><br />Right from its sense of fulfilling prophecy through to its continual quest
for metaphysical truth, or even to its final visual ascension of its main
character, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of those wonderfully rare Hollywood movies
that, while it appears on the surface to be one thing, is actually another.
On the surface, it is a futuristic  action film that fills the screen with
fights, computers, and elaborate visual effects--but underneath all that the
dialogue and lessons that the characters must learn are very specifically
the route each one of us must take when questioning our own existence and
our belief in an alternate reality or heaven and God.  And even more
remarkably, discovering the hidden world beneath the apparent surface of
things is exactly what the story of &quot;The Matrix&quot; all about.<br /><br />In &quot;The Matrix,&quot; the lead character, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn), has been
awakening those he can to the real truth about their existence, all the
while searching--along with the lead female character, Trinity (Carrie-Ann
Moss)--for &quot;the One&quot; he believes fulfills the prophecy and will save the
world.  The difference between thinking and believing is key in &quot;The
Matrix,&quot; and Morpheus thinks he's found &quot;the One&quot; in the form of the
mild-mannered, but anti-authoritarian computer programmer, Thomas Anderson
(Keanu Reeves)--who leads an alternate life as the computer hacker, Neo,
obsessed with answering the question of &quot;what is the Matrix?&quot;<br /><br />So, just what is the Matrix?  In the proper spirit of the &quot;personal quest&quot;
of &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;you have to find out for
yourself.&quot;  Suffice it to say that as far as the story is concerned, it's a
complex, but nicely explained, science fiction story that combines all our
obsessions at the end of the millennium:  guns and violence, interlinked
communications networks, and our fear of computers ruling the world, all
assembled in a dark, punk-music-infused framework with surprisingly less
gratuitous violence than the previews would lead one to believe.  In fact,
&quot;The Matrix&quot; actually takes plenty of time to let its characters talk and
let the audience mull over its complex and surprisingly thought-provoking
concepts.
