I thought that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was an amazing movie.  It was well balanced in
that it had something for almost every person.  It had enough action to
keep
someone who likes action fixed on the screen.  It was a science fiction but
it had it's moments where you wondered if what they were saying applied to
real life.  All around I thought this movie was very well rounded and
appealed to many people.
