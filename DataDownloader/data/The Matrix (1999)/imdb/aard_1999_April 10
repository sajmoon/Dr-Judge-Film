Wow...I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time.  While not entirely
plausible and with a few plot and character shortcomings, I was more
&quot;into&quot;
this movie while watching it than I have been for quite some time.
Excellent cinematography and special effects with a decent story line and
beautiful settings and clothing.  A real &quot;cyber&quot;-ish movie that keeps the
plot moving sufficiently.  Definitely worth seeing, I'll be seeing it
again.
