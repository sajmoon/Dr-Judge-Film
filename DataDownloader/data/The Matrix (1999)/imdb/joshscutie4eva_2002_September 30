This movie is a b*****n movie. Not only is the special effects awesome, its
just the movie itself. Its about a guy named Neo, who perfectly normal
during the day but is a computer hacker at night. He is trying to uncover
what has pulled over our eyes: what is the Matrix. It gets even more
suspenseful and and you can't even move from your seat. totally
10/10
