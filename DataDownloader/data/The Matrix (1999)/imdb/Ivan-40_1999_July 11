&quot;The Matrix&quot; had a great start and middle, but it sure stunk at
the end.
&gt;
I mean the graphics were outstanding, the acting passable
screen wondering every minute, &quot;What's going to happen next?&quot;
Like &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;, I had no idea what was
going on for a lot of the movie, but I mean that as a
compliment. And when the secrets were finally revealed, I was
blown away by the concepts.
&gt;
But then, the story resorts to stupid shoot-em-ups (complete
with with the cliched fruit market with exploding watermelons)
and chase scenes. If that's not bad enough, there's the
&gt;terrible, TERRIBLE way the hero is brought back to life which
had audience members giggling.
