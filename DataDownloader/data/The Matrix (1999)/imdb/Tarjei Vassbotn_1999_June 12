The Matrix is everything Blade could have been, and then
some.
It's raw, it's intelligent, it's awesome. This movie isn't just another
'what-is-the-earth-like-100-years-from-no'-type of film.
It gives you the same mindgames as Total Recall, the same
cutting edge special effects as T2 had when it was released,
and
yet it's simple. Simple because you'll probably enjoy it
in whatever mood you're in.
Don't take my word for it, go see it!
