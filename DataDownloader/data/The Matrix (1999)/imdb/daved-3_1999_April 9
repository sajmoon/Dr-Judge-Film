The Matrix is visually stunning (not just the FX, but also wonderful
direction and camerawork and superb fight choreography) but should appeal
only to hard core SF fans.  It has familiar plot elements taken from TRON,
Terminator 2 and several other SF stories, but it is so innovative in its
visuals you don't mind (in fact, the story needs to be familiar to make
sense of it).  Keanu is at his best looking slack-jawed and going, &quot;Whoa!&quot;
It lacks the pace of T-2, but the ending is dynamite (literally).
