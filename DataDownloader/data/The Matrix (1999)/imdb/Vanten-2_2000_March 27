God story line (yes it has some logical holes, but tell me
any movie who doesn't), incredible stunts and unbelievable
special effects.<br /><br />Can it be any better? Of course it can, but this movie would
be difficult to beat in its genre.<br /><br />One drawback, though, you can tell that The Matrix has too
much influences of Anime films.
