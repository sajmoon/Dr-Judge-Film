Some people believe that there is a Messianic message in this movie because
of the fight between Matrix's campaign of domination in the &quot;real&quot; world and
&quot;Thomas A. Anderson / Neo,&quot; Keanu Reeves (A Walk in the Clouds, Much Ado
About Nothing) the man who is to save the world.  He joins warriors
&quot;Morpheus &quot; Laurence Fishburne (Searching for Bobby Fischer),  and &quot;Trinity&quot;
Carrie Ann Moss (Lethal Tender)  in their warfare against the Matrix.<br /><br />Neo does die and comes back to life and at one point he believes that &quot;He is
the One&quot; to save the world. If that was the intent of the writer, the
message is not clear as far as I am concerned. There are Messianic elements
in many of the super-heros such as Superman, with his powerful vision,
Batman who fights the evil and forces of darkness of Gotham City and I just
think that Neo is another super-hero with some type of &#145;god like'
characteristics. To characterize the movie as a Christian movie is really
stretching it. There is an element of deception such as the woman in red, is
she real or is she a deceiver?  There is deception  in Batman when all the
enemies come wearing a camouflage such as Mr. Freeze, The Riddler,   etc. I
believe that there is an element of deception or even mistaken identity, if
you will, in many movies.
I really enjoyed the movie for its special effects and so did the members of
the Academy of Motion Pictures as the movie won an Oscar for Special Effects
among many other Oscars.
I am not much into science fiction but I bought the tape because it was
recommended by a bunch of Christian friends. The movie is fine, but I found
that the movies such as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; also have a religious side to them
as the boy seeks peace and shelter in a church. There is definitely a
struggle between good and evil, but everyone is dead already.  In &quot;The Sixth
Sense&quot; nobody gets that there is no big mystery about the movie except that
they are all dead and are talking. Does the dead talk? The Bible indicates
that they do. Look at Lazarus. And that was the catch, in The Matrix, that
many are led to believe: whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath
the surface. Perhaps, there is,  but I do not see that as a Christian movie,
just a     science-fiction movie which you can analyze anyway you want
to.
I had a hard time identifying scenes that were thoughts and scenes that were
part of the &quot;realm of reality in the movie.&quot; Anyway, I thought that The
Truman Show had a big element of the &quot;eternal&quot; versus the &quot;temporary&quot;  in
the realm of reality.   
Favorite Scenes: Trinity jumping from one building to another. Obviously no
human can do that without some type of super power. But I don't think that
it would be fair to compare her to the Trinity known by
Christians.
Favorite Quotes: Trinity: &quot; You're looking for him. I know because I was
once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't
really looking for him. I was  looking for an answer. It's the question that
drives us. It's the question that brought you here.&quot;  Morpheus:&quot; I'm trying
to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one
that has to walk through it.&quot;
This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the
movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion
on the topic of the Christian message in &quot;The Matrix.&quot; We will have to wait
until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to
the story.  I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of
any future Matrix. Actually I could argue both sides of the
issue.
