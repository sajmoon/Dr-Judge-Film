The plot is a guarantee to take your mind on a run. Just follow the white
rabbit and enjoy the ride. It will take you on a fantastic voyage through
reality or what you think it is. After &quot;the usual suspects&quot; finally there is
a movie out that shows why moviemakers also went to school. 10 out of 10 for
me.
Please never see this movie in a cinema that has not got the latest
hardware, your day will be ruined.
