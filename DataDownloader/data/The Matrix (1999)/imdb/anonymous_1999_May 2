1999_May 2 

This movie is the best I've seen since Star Trek: Insurrection.  I
actually
had no desire to see it but went anyway.  I was shocked at the stunning
special effects that were put into this movie.  Definitely an award
winner!
I was left speechless afterwards.  There wasn't one thing I didn't like
about the movie.  Even the soundtrack is the best I've ever owned.  As of
now it's my all time favorite (the movie and the CD).  It'll take A LOT to
move this movie out of the #1 spot in my top 10 list!
