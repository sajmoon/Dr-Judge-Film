1999_December 30 

You have  to  see  this twice,  not  only because it's  great. To  really
understand  it  you  have  see  it  at  least twice.
This movie really  does  have a  good  script  and  WONDERFUL special
effects. I  can't  say enough  good  things  about  this  movie,  and  I
have  nothing  bad  to  say. Carrie-Anne Moss  and  Laurence Fishburne
deliver superb performances and Keanu  Reeves  did  a  wonderful  job
acting  If  you  like  sci-fi  movies  this  is
the  movie  for  you.  Way  better  than  Jhonny Mnemonic! A  movie  to
bring  in  the  Millenium  with!!
