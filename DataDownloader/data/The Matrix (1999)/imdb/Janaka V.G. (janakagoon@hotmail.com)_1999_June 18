Hmmm... I wonder what would have happened if they
got some money from Pepsi... The agents might be
showing taking long slow gulps of soft driks at
very conspicuous vending machines.<br /><br />Keenau can't act.. but thats okey since nobody needs
to really act in this CGI exhibition.<br /><br />A promising plot... but glaring holes in logic degrades
that...<br /><br />Not too bad.. if you want to waste 2hrs one lazy afternoon...
I've seen MUCH worse ... Armegeddon ( shudder, cringe ) for
example.
