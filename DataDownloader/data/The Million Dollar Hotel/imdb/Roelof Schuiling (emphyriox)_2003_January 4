1. The music: largely written and performed by Bono and his U2 friends, it
fits the movie very well. The music is usually kind of
gloomy.<br /><br />2. John Lennon is in it! One of the nuts in the hotel thinks he has been a
close friend of John Lennon and that he has cowritten all of the Beatles
songs. He's very funny.<br /><br />3.  The characters are very unusual, so they tended to surprise me with
the
things they said and did. They do not always make sense, but that's
alright.
They surprised me, changed my state of mind and I started to love
them.<br /><br />4. It's a movie that stands out. It's kind of slow, but if you can bear
with
that every scene brings a surprise. I liked the surprises in the
plot.
