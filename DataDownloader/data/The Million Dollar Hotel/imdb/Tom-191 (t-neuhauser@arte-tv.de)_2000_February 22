Wenders is still a great visionair of contemporary cinema, but the love
story here does not function at all. Beautiful pictures  in the beginning
and in the end, but in between he looses the story trying to find always
metaphorical and symbolic scenes and that is sometimes boring.  Milla
Jovovich and Jeremy Davies are great actors but not convincing as a couple
in love.
But Wenders music-taste is reliable, a very good soundtrack! So it is only
consequent and not a tragic irony that he probably will get his first
Oscar
not for one of his long fiction films, but for a music documentary: Buena
Vista Social Club.
