2002_April 3 

For those of you who are big Mel Gibson fans. This is not your
movie.
This is for Wim Wenders and U2 fans. This is an art film, though it
is
made accessible by the performances of Davies, Jovovich and Gibson.
It
is a very simple, character driven film with a host of great actors.
(It
is nice to see that Bud Cort is doing something interesting.) The
best
films usually take a simple story and do it very well. Such are
the
films of Kubrik and Kurosawa, two of the greatest film-makers of
all
time (if you don't agree there is a good chance you wont like
this
film). This film (as opposed to just &quot;movie&quot;) has a very simple
story,
but it does it beautifully. I recommend it to any film
lover.<br /><br />PS: If you like this one check out &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; by Kurosawa and
&quot;Purple
Noon&quot; (trans.) by Clement.
