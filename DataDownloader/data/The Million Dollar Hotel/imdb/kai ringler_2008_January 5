2008_January 5 
a very interesting movie to say the least, don&#39;t expect lot&#39;s of action
cause you&#39;ll be sorely disappointed. this is more of a character study
into the lives of mental patients, or the poor who can&#39;t afford health
insurance, a little detective story thrown in the mix, you have Mel
Gibson, who plays an FBI agent who&#39;s himself a little of his rocker.
Jeremy Davies is great in the lead role of Tom Tom.. Milla Jovovich is
also great in here role as Heloise. The supporting actors and actresses
are great as well. Wish i would have seen a little more of Tim Roth,,
but that&#39;s okay. The film is a little long, and some spots seems to
drag, but just when i wanted to turn it off or skip, something kept
pulling at me,, and low and behold, presto chango, the film kicked in
to shall we say overdrive. It&#39;s a very interesting piece of work,, the
music is great featuring Bono, and U2, Bono had the idea for the story,
after shooting the music video Where the Streets have No Name. he made
a bet with edge,, edge said he could make the 10ft jump to the roof of
the next building over.the film opens with one of the most interesting
premises for a beginning, and the best line i think so far ever, for
away for the first lines of a movie,, thumbs up.
