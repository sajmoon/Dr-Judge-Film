When you see a movie and you don&#x27;t like it you usually have a slight
idea about what you disliked.Well, when I finished this one, I had the
terrible notion (maybe the first time I ever felt it) that it was a
complete waste of time. It is without any doubt the worst movie ever
done by Win Wenders and I can point what is the biggest problem of this
complete mess: a script written by Bono Vox. The story doesn&#x27;t make any
type of sense, the acting is very poor and the context is just out of
context. I realized that I was losing my time when after one hour of
movie I had no idea about what was the movie was about. This is a true
personal opinion more than a review, but as a movie addicted, this was
one of the biggest disappointments I&#x27;ve ever had.
