2001_August 30 

A nearly crippled FBI agent, played by none other than Mel Gibson, arrives
at a flop house for uninsured alcoholics, drug users and the mentally
challenged to investigate the murder (or was it suicide) of a rich man's
son. He meets, among others, an Indian named Geronimo, a man who claims to
have been an uncredited member of The Beatles, an alcoholic whose toupee is
on askew, a strange young woman and the even stranger young man who loves
her. <br /><br />This film has some great things in it but overall, was too long, slow and
bizarre for my taste.  Part of the problem for me was that some of the
dialogue was totally unintelligible.  There were some good acting,  lines,
situations and moments but ultimately it was too left of strange for me -
kind of like a Twin Peaks episode that veered off the charts.
