After reading so many bad reviews and comments on The Million Dollar
Hotel movie, I decided to write one. Unlike most of them who have seen
the movie, I must say that I perceive The Million Dollar Hotel as a
good stylish film. I personally think that movies should sometimes be
listened to instead of just watched in order to get the best of it.
This one is just magical. I believe that the characters themselves had
a better grasp on reality than most people I know. The soundtrack is
absolutely beautiful and the cast is amazing. By that I mean especially
Mila Jovovich and Jeremy Davies. He gives a fantastic and inspired
performance. He is a true actor&#39;s actor. Jeremy is also brilliant and
impressive as a narrator and gives the film a special drill. Besides
all that, the script is so capturing that some parts of it like &quot; a
man&#39;s home is a man&#39;s castle&quot; will stay in my mind forever. Maybe the
movie is not for everyday&#39;s audiences, but I would recommend it to
anyone who believes film is not just for escapist entertainment but for
awaking our senses and stirring our minds, because there&#39;s no doubt
that this movie is a thinker.
