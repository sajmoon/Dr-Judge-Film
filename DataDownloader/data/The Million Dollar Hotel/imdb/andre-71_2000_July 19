2000_July 19 

I avoided this film, because of the bad criticism it got in the newspapers.
But then I decided to see it at a low price cinema. And I thought, it
wasn't
all that bad as the critics said. I admit that one has to be in the right
mood for this film, and I might alter my judgment, if I saw it a second
time. But this time, I enjoyed the way it showed me how colorful life can
be, even if it is a difficult and not generally admired one. Each well
played character has a different story to tell, and one has to think a
little about them. In the end, I took a lot of positive thoughts home. But
you have to let yourself go, otherwise you will be disappointed.
