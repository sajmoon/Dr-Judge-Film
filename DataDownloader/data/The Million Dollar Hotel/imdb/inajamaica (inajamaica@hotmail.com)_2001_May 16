This movie became my favorite after I saw it.  It was funny and playful at
first...cute.  After learning the situation and the characters, there was
still an innocent fun, though you began to sympathize a little.  Finally,
you are completely (if you let your self be) sucked into the emotion &amp;
plot.
I don't want to give away alot, but want to say that the visuals were
artistic and nothing less than excellent.  The acting was fun and never
overdone.  This is a must see!
