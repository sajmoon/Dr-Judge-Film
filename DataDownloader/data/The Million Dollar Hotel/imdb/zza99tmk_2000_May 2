I agree very much with the review coming from the Italian reader: Wenders'
latest film comes nowhere even close to the
wonderful &quot;Himmel ueber Berlin&quot; or the director's first
american
movie &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;. The characters are underdeveloped,
most
of them unbearably freakish (those who dismiss &quot;American
Beauty&quot;
for its character spleens will find it comparatively reserved
after having seen &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot;, I'm sure).<br /><br />Jeremy Davies, who can be a very good actor (if I remember
it
correctly, he was in Terence Mallicks &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;),
but Tom Tom is just too childish as a character to be taken
serious. Well, we know he is meant to be the typical innocent
Wenders so often portrays in his films, but it doesn't
work.
Sadly, this can be said of practically every part of Bono's
and Nicholas Kleins' script: the film fails both as a love
story
and a whodunit, though Mel Gibson played Skinner really
well
(and I usually really despise Gibson, having played in
some
self-indulgent roles and really idiotic movies). Milla
Jovovich
gave a decent performance and Jimmy Smits did the best with
his
role of Geronimo - if only they had get a better script.
Admittedly, the movie offers some worth seeing cinematography
and Bono wrote some really atmospheric score, but all in
all
&quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; didn't live up to my expectations.
Though &quot;Der Himmel ueber Berlin&quot; (or &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; as
the
film is called in english) is also rather slow, it is still
the most poetic and artistically successful german film of
the
last 15 years and instead of going to see &quot;Million Dollar
Hotel&quot;
I recommend you to watch &quot;Himmel ueber Berlin&quot; on video.
