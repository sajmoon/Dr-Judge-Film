the film was a pleasant surprise to me.
Mel Gibson was on the cover of the videotape and that's why I didn't
suspect
such a laidback movie.
You have to be in the mood for it, but once you're into it you like
it.
All the actors, including Mel Gibson which is not particularly my favorite
although he did a great job in Braveheart, we're great especially the two
main actors.
One plays a retard very convincing and the other one is pretty f*cked up,
but is really smart.
If you wanna see a nice, laidback, surprising, retarted movie you'll like
this one.
