(Insert cussing here). (Insert more cussing here). I just sat through
this travesty... It took less than 10 minutes for this movie to
convince me it sucked BIG TIME. Still, maybe it was necessary for the
plot and the movie would take a turn or something.... So like a
retarded moron, I just sat there. Watching... Hoping...<br /><br />The lead guy is so annoying. I think he is the guy inside Jar Jar
Binks, cuz that was the last time I hated anyone this much. He is
supposed to be cute-crazy. Repeating everything he says, face going
from one retarded expression to the next every second. There is one
scene where Mel Gibson almost starts stomping him, and I was
cheering... I was let down again. ...and there's an &quot;english&quot;
character. &quot;I wrote all the Beatles lyrics&quot; ha ha, funny. And said with
an accent. Wow. Give him lots of screen time. The rest of the
characters are equally worthless in every sense...<br /><br />The story? I guess there is one in there. Well hidden! The movie is
really one nut case talking, then pan over to the next moron talking.
All about nothing. Just wearing down the rest of your poor nerves.<br /><br />I can't think of any reason to see this one. The people who likes it in
here, mostly writes about how its strange that everybody hates it. Not
really telling why they liked it. I was hoping for some enlightenment,
on why this movie shouldn't have been released on VHS only, so the poor
sucker buyers at least could have taped something else over it.<br /><br />The guy who wants an ending with Gibson carrying Jovovich away while in
the background you see a nuclear bomb eradicating the hotel WITH
inhabitants... I'm with that guy! Stay clear of this one unless you are
a U2/Bono fan, cuz then you deserve this crap.<br /><br />PS: Funny thing. Check the total number of reviews made by the people
who likes this one, and then compare to the back catalogue of the
people who hates it. The more movies you have commented on, the bigger
are the chances that you will hate it. So if you never seen a movie
before, this might be a good start? :)
