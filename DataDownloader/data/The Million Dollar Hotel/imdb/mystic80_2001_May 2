The Million Dollar Hotel is quite literally, one of the weirdest movies I
have ever seen that features a two time oscar winner such as Mel Gibson.
Gibson plays a beyond straight arrow of an FBI agent named Skinner, sent to
investigate the mysterious suicide of a millionaire's son (an unbilled Tim
Roth) in a seedy hotel that is host to a group of the poor mentally ill. Tom
Tom (Jeremy Davies, eschewing Private Upham completely from &quot;Saving Private
Ryan), is a half wit delivery boy for the hotel with odd hair who's got a
thing for a screw up (Milla Jovovich). Skinner performs a drastic
investigation on the hotel who's inhabitants include the Fifth Beatle (a
convincing Peter Stormare playing a good guy), an Indian (LA Law's Jimmy
Smits!), an old lady (Gloria Stuart, far from her Titanic role), Harold,
oops! I mean Bud Cort as a recurring alcoholic, a weirdo (Amanda Plummer, in
another fine character role), and others. Definitely an eccentric film that
is far from Hollywood. Gibson is quite, to describe it lightly, strange as
an FBI agent not to be trifled with. His face alone is that of something
that's out of a Stephen King novel. Jeremy Davies seems as if he's had way
too many No Doz pills to fulfill the lead role, one that requires him to
barely speak. Filled with small roles from recognizable character actors,
this is a film that's for an acquired taste, because this is very out there
for a movie.
