&quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; is the best Wenders movie for a long time. After
the disappointing last one &quot;The End of Violence&quot; this film represents what
the &quot;The End of Violence&quot; probably should have been. What seemed there
confused and lacking the specific atmosphere is realised in &quot;The Million
Dollar Hotel&quot; in a fascinating way. Wenders creates a surrealistic and a
the
same time very realistic mood with the support of his brilliant actors, the
great music and the superb photography work by which every single picture
is
perfect for itself.<br /><br />The film's magic can of course not be found in the plot, which could be
told
in one sentence. What makes this film special is Wenders' ability to create
a world of its own, which is as freaky as it is of a thrilling realism.
Every character is interesting and pictures a single microcosm. While in
the
beginning one must think all the time of David Lynch and his idea of a FBI
special agent in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the film slowly becomes an impressing study
of two both fascinating and still very strange people. Yet it never becomes
moralistic or tries to reach a political correctness in the sense of
`Respect handicapped people although they are freaks!'. Wenders' aesthetic
approach is to make their world visible on the screen. And in the
perfection
he does it this is very much.<br /><br />&quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; is Wenders as his best. You shouldn't expect an
action movie or a drama with the plot complexity of &quot;King Lear&quot;. But if you
like the subtle humour of Lynch combined with Wender's perfect art of
photography and the charm of an European deconstructing LA (there has never
been a better characterisation of LA as far as I know), you'll love that
film. I did.
