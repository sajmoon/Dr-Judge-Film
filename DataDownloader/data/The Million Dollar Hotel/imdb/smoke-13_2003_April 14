I thought I was inside a PK Dick story here.  The peelback of the reality
onion was superb.  Bono and Wenders scored here with a charming moebius
plot.  Dying to watch this over and over again.  Characters had
interesting
stories develop over the whole movie, not just the beginning and end.
Some
people might be crazy, or as I think, each of these characters are kings
and
queens in their own realities.  Too many people have reviewed this movie
in
a linear fashion.  It just isn't that simple of a story or an artistic
presentation.  Scenes throughout touch base with reality and then twist
away, airy, and come back with charm and certainly more questions than
answers.  Just the way I like.  No one should be allowed to touch a PK
Dick
story except these gentlemen, in my opinion.  They've crafted an original
here.
