This movie is both well paced and thoughtful, and it works on many levels,
which gives it a richness that so many movies lack.  While the plot moves
the movie along at a good pace, the movie has a philosophical grounding that
very few movies possess.  This grounding provides an intellectual breadth
that enables a legitimate discussion (not dictation) of who we are, what are
we worth and how we value of our relationships.  Though religion is not
mentioned at all, I consider it to be a religious movie because it explored
questions that provoked (at least in me) questions about
G-d.<br /><br />The music by U2 is excellent.  It enhances the visual by complementing the
visual with the appropriate tone and mood.<br /><br />The cast is very good, Jimmy Smits is excellent, Mel Gibson gives an
outstanding performance and shows he's a great actor whose talent is indeed
independent of his star power, but clearly the movie is bigger than any of
the actor's performances, as well as it should be.<br /><br />The only negative is the performance of Milla Jovovich.  I've found her
range so very limited in the past (not much beyond  a frantic expression). 
Here she does much better to the point where her performance is, if not
adequate, then tolerable, but she still falls significantly short of what
the role offered.  Luckily the story supports her and her inadequacies as an
actress does not impair the movie.<br /><br />I gave it a 10 despite Jovovich.<br /><br />DM
