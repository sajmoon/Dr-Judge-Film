Why did Mel Gibson do this movie?  I would have said before this movie that
I'd like anything he did.  I now take that back.  This movie sucked real
wind all the way through the 30 minutes we watched it.  Then I turned on
&quot;Flipper does Miami&quot; on the Animal Planet and saw something with a real
plot.  Sad, sad sad.
