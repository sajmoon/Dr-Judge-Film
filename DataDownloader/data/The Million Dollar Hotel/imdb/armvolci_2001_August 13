It is sssso painstaking to even bother commenting on this film, however i
have somehow managed to droop over my keyboard and comment on this stomach
churning sad excuse for a film. Within the first half hour of this hideous
film i realised that i was one of the chosen ones? Fate had cruelly made me
witness the worst film of all time! This movie warrants no more comment
from
me and from this day forward i vow never to watch a movie with mel gibson,
how desperate was he to take such a drop dead role?<br /><br />absolutly gut wrenching!!!<br /><br />-10/10
