This movie took a long time to make - fifteen years, in fact. It was
spearheaded by Bono and U2, and still it took forever to make. However
- and I'm loathe to say this because I'm not big on U2 - this is a
great little arty gem of a movie.<br /><br />Wim Wenders does his usual bit. If you've never seen a Wim Wenders
movie, just imagine what a film by a man who was born in the ruins of
postwar Berlin, had five wives between the years 1968 and 1981 (avg.
length of marriage a little over two years)and is the Martin Scorcese
of Germany looks like. He is himself above all a cinephile, and left
studies of medicine and philosophy and a career as an artist to dive
into the world of film. He, like the great 70s Generation in the
States, came of age in a time of political turbulence and artistic
experimentation, and it shows in his work. <br /><br />He's a director's director, and European to boot, so some audiences are
just going to dislike it as a matter of course. For those not turned
off by Art House movies, there is a lot here to like.<br /><br />The huge ensemble cast features a menagerie of the best character
actors working, such as Amanda Plummer, Bud Cort, Harris Yulin, and
others. Bigger actors also do an art turn, like Milla Jovovich as the
femme in a love triangle involving a mental case and a rich kid who may
or may not have committed suicide, and Mel Gibson as the Fed who's
investigating his plummet from the roof.<br /><br />It has a dreamlike quality that legitimizes the extreme characters, who
are at turns theatrically poetic and comically absurd, but always
bizarre.<br /><br />Basically, this is a love it or hate it flick, I suspect, though many
will not be sure if they love it or hate it on the first viewing. I
have yet to see it again, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the
doubt.<br /><br />Also highly recommended for the chemically enhanced ;)
