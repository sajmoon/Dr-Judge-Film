How can&#39;t you love the way Wenders creates and shows a believable yet
totally fictional world? How can&#39;t you get tired watching Davies
evolutions in the air, all gestures and arms? It is poetry in movement,
sick poetry, with an impossible innocence around it. How can&#39;t you deny
the irony behind this madhouse, the delusions denounced by the most
delusional of all, the special agent Skinner? I simply love the way
Wenders takes me for a ride inside his imagined world, populated by so
heterogeneous characters, so defined, so well structured. And the
constant in his movies, the joyous affirmation of life as an experience
that we all have the opportunity to enjoy, no matter how poor, how
impaired, how delusional.<br /><br />It takes compassion to see the hidden beauty in the dark corners of the
human soul, and artistic skill to show it. Because Wenders has both, I
admire him and his work.
