2000_November 5 

Saw the movie with much expectations since I am a Wenders lover. I left
the
movies' with a strange feeling. Not a bad movie, not a good movie. What
stroke me most was the soundtrack: I felt it had not much to do with the
movie and with Wenders. I loved photography. Think the cast was good,
except
for Mel Gibson...
Still quite slow. Felt the story itself was not important. I am happy I
have seen it and probably I will it see a
second time, but the million dollar hotel will not be THE movie, but
remain
a movie. Sorry for Bono, good attempt but not enough. Still the soundtrack
by itself is really good.
