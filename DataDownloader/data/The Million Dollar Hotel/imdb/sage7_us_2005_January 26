Another side of Mel done well and a re-education on what can happen
when art happens. Amidst all of the sensationalism and entertainment
that we must expect in order for us to feel whole and complete is the
illusion that these things are for real for everybody for all time.
What a sham. What a scam. What a miserable web we cling to. I
appreciate the &quot;other side of life&quot; that is appended to the status quo
Blaissez-faire virtual reality middle-America wanna-be rich mentality
that is portrayed in everything else we see and breathe. The &quot;Hotel&quot;
goes deeper and darker into the psyche of normalcy with a deftness and
aptitude unclaimed by lesser &quot;individuals&quot;. Thanks for the Real Show.
