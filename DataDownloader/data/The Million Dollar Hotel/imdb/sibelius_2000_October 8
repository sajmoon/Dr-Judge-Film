Right from the moment when the film started, i'd realize The Million
Dollar
Hotel was going to be something different from the movies I'd watched
before. The cinematography, the music, the set - all these merge together
and make it so unique. Tomtom is my favourite cinematic character of all
time. He got an angel heart, he is lovely and passionate, he saves his
girlfriend by giving up his life. Unfortunately, it's hard to find
somebody
like Tomtom nowadays.....
