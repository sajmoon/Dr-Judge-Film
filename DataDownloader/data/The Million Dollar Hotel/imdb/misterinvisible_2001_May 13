I really enjoyed this movie.  It was very good, but one thing kinda ruined
it for me.  Tom Tom.  He was just a little too &quot;retarded&quot; if you ask me.  He
was hopping around like a kangaroo for the entire film.  I liked him better
when he was being &quot;romantic&quot;, but it was almost like a different character.<br /><br />I found it very interesting that everyone had such distinct personalities.
Also, I was amazed by Jimmy Smits in this!  I don't know what Mel Gibson's
problem with this film was.  It showed an interesting side to his acting
abilities.<br /><br />From what I've seen of his recent films, Wim Wenders is starting to
concentrate a little harder.  Maybe his &quot;End Of Violence&quot; put me off a
little.  Regardless, this is a very fun movie, and won't alienate someone
unfamiliar with his films.
