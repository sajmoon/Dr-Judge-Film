What was Mel Gibson thinking when taking part in this movie? It is slow,
unexciting and crowded with annoying characters that are impossible to
connect with unless you are emotionally challenged. So what if Wim Wenders
got an award in Cannes once for making one of the slowest movies
ever(Paris
Texas).You simply need a good screenplay to make a good
picture.
The story doesn't take off. At least it didn't in the first three quarter
hour and by then i just didn't care. It is unfocused, drifting like a ship
in a storm. And Bono's music doesn't help either.
