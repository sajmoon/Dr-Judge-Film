The Million Dollar Hotel is a tragic-comedy/romantic film. The story
begins in the middle of an investigation at the Million Dollar Hotel,
home to ill people, too poor to afford medical insurance. Detective
Skinner (Mel Gibson) is investigating a supposed murder at the hotel,
when a former resident jumps off of the roof. The film follows the
journey of one character, Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies)as his life changes
dramatically. The film also includes the character Eloise (Milla
Jovovich) a prostitute of whom Tom Tom falls in love with. The film was
gripping and emotional, and left me on the edge of my seat until the
end. The characters were believable and lovable, especially Tom Tom,
who you grew to love, mainly because of the way he sees the world. Its
Uplifting yet depressing and conveys a sense of reality despite how
absurd some of the characters are. The setting is very affective, with
the way the hotel is grimy and disgusting, to show how neglected the
residents are at the million dollar hotel. The camera angles are
effective and the story was altogether simple and effective. There is
no graphic sex or violence, and all together it was an amazing film. A
definite must see for all those Mel Gibson Fans! And even if you are'nt
a Mel Gibson fan its still worth a look.
