I thought that I must have fallen asleep because I did not understand a
thing about what is this movie about. But I realised it was only running
for
ten minutes. Mel Gibson came in. He walked and talked as if he entered
twin
peaks. The only thing that missed was the nice music of angel badalamenti.
Someone spoke. But I could not catch up. This movie is your worst
nightmare.
Don't go to Blockbuster to rent it. Let it rest in the
stores.
