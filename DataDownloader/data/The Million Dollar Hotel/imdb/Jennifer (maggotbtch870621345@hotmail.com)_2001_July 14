Some people might not understand the movie , or think that it drags out
but
I loved this movie. The performances were AMAZING , and the plot was so
....
unusual. What I liked the most about the movie was the way it opened your
eyes to a different point of view or `environment` that many people are
afraid to see. I hate to admit it , but the film made me cry , and I`m not
the type to cry at movies. Like many people have already said , it is a
very
sad and depressing movie , but its REALLY worth watching. (a piece of
advice: If your not the kind of person who`s patient enough to sit through
a
movie that really makes you think , then you most likely won`t think very
highly of it)
