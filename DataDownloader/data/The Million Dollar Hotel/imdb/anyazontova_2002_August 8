The Million Dollar Hotel is not for passive watching where you are led
by the hand through the familiar landscape and characters of a mystery
movie. Nor are you given musical cues to know how to feel in a
particular instance. You have to work off your senses and intellect to
perceive it, and to be patient if it takes you in a direction opposite
to your wildest guesses.<br /><br />It can even get irritating - as you are about to blame the movie for
having no spine - or in truth, for lacking, entirely, conventional
twists and turns. It throws you off as you are figuring out whether to
perceive it as a film of crime or suicide, romance or a freak house,
comedy, mockery or living poetry. Like life, this film has it
all.<br /><br />Yet in a sense, the movie is transparent in foreshadowing its three
major themes and their resolution - coming from its very heartbeat, the
lyrics co-written and performed mostly by Bono.  In the opening scene,
a young man Tom Tom hurls himself from the roof of a dreary flophouse -
&quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; in downtown Los Angeles - committing suicide
with a strange joyfulness. The mystery of his exuberance in this moment
becomes the driving question of the film as we then review the last two
weeks of his life. But in the moment itself, Bono's song which
accompanies Tom Tom's rush to the brink contains three revealing
verses:<br /><br />`I have a lover...
She shows me colors where there's none to see
Gives me hope when I can't believe...'<br /><br />`I have a brother...
I spend my whole time running
He spends his running after me...
But for the first time I feel love.'<br /><br />`My father is a rich man...
He said: I have many mansions
And there are many rooms to see.
But I left by the back door
And I threw away the key.'<br /><br />Love, brotherhood and father-son relationships so outlined in the song
are treated here entirely unconventionally. And the breakdown of formal
conventions simply occurs with a `surprising' shift in accents, or
values - when love is more important than mystery solving, and a cop
treats his suspect as his brother...<br /><br />In the world of this movie, the love of a slightly odd boy towards a
prostitute, awkward at first, ends up transcending death. And so does
the brotherhood binding the colorful resident freaks of the Million
Dollar Hotel; though verging on parody, it's rooted in that same
longing of the heart, `a Sleeping Beauty` which `dreams to be
awakened.`  And we forget the commentary on the bizarre events and
characters are made by a dead `brother' telling us of the best two
weeks in his life.<br /><br />As the movie rolls back in time, we learn of a similar fate, falling
from the hotel roof, of Tom Tom's best friend - who had come `from
money and power' yet rejected them to live `with bums and Indians.' The
son of a Jewish multibillionaire media king whose `people decide truth
in 60 countries every morning,' the Father who has many mansions, the
God of Television, of the reality game which so charms the hotel
residents and Tom Tom... until Tom Tom begins to have a life which is
`much better than television.'<br /><br />And while you are still trying hard to follow the intrigue, all of a
sudden your heart is being cut open... but then is mended together.
Broken to be healed. To find a new meaning in death that brings the
living together, and love that brings one to death, yet brings out even
more love. The death after which `things finally hit you,' when you see
it all that clearly that `life is perfect... full of magic, beauty and
opportunity' but which we `only really feel when it's gone.'  It's not
the same as television. `For the first time/I feel...'<br /><br />One character talking, the other doing the action at a different place
seem to convey the shared experience of living. One distinct voice, of
a poet retelling us the story in his songs, is Bono's. He appears in a
flash as a silent cameo mixed with the crowd of the Million Dollar
Hotel residents. A powerful voice of Tom Tom's innermost self, the
voice of his soul, Bono's singing exceeds anything I've ever heard
before, reaching straight into your heart. `I come back above/Where
there is only love...' his voice is fading, as if calling from above,
sensitizing you to the very tips of your fingers.  All the while the
uplifting images from under the sky of downtown Los Angeles take you up
to another dimension.<br /><br />Mel Gibson, whose `Icon Productions' co-produced the movie, waived his
star fee. His contribution to the film as an unconventional cop,
somewhat resonating with his directorial debut, `The Man Without a
Face', has a unique flavor you should discover on your own.  The
brilliant casting, starting with Jeremy Davis' finely tuned performance
as the blessed fool Tom Tom, is topped by Wim Wenders' ever  masterful
charting of unknown territories in filmmaking. The artful
cinematography and editing are yet another reason for film adepts and
students to see this one.<br /><br />Nevertheless, The Million Dollar Hotel played in U.S. theaters for only
a week.  I recommend this movie to anyone who believes film is not just
for escapist entertainment but for awaking our senses and stirring our
minds. As with a good book, you can embark on a journey through The
Million Dollar Hotel-DVD over and over again, as if reading it each
time for the first time.
