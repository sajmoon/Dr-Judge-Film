On the surface, The Million Dollar Hotel is about a mysterious suicide. But
while Mel Gibson investigates as  Special Agent Skinner the story shifts
from whodunnit to character study. The Million Dollar Hotel is populated by
people who are not quite normal but not completely crazy either. People
living in their own world(s). What this movie accomplishes is to take you
right into this world. There are no maps or guidelines, you're on your own,
and you have to decide how far you want to go. You could find this movie
boring, a complete waste even, but you could also fall in love with the
characters. Just give it a try.
