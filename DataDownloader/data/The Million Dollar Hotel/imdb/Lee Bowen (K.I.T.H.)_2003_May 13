Been meaning to watch this for ages.
Bought the soundtrack a long time ago on release, due to liking U2 and
especially Daniel Lanois. Bought it on DVD but just got round to watching.<br /><br />Superbly filmed which you'd expect of a Wenders project.
The cast are superb with Jeremy Davies and Jovovich playing their respective
parts to perfection. I liked the John Lennon alike, despite his accent being
dodgy at times but that was all part of the character for me. A great
rendition of &quot;I am the walrus&quot;. The music is sublime and there are many
parts that make you really feel the emotion. There are also many funny dark
moments. 
I don't want to give plots away but not once did I feel bored or it was
going slow. It just sets the scene and sucks you in until you find out what
happens. And it's certainly something I'd watch again.<br /><br />A sort of Fight Club esque film in the fact that you have to think and
watch. My only gripe at times was Tom's very quiet dialogue, I had to rewind
a few times to make sure I didn't miss stuff on the speech. Overall superb
though, I gave it 8.
