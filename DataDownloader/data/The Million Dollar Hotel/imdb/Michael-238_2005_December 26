I first saw this film by accident - it was in the wrong box from the
video rental store. But I'm a huge Wim Wenders fan (especially Wings of
Desire) and was not disappointed. It has that undefinable
Wenders-created atmosphere of magic existing cheek and jowl with
tragedy that really makes you want to know exactly how DOES he see the
world. An outstanding cast headed by the criminally under-appreciated
Jeremy Davies, with excellent performances by Milla Jovovich, Mel
Gibson and many others.<br /><br />The wonderfully atmospheric score is from a pastiche of sources -
something I usually hate - but beautifully chosen in this case, with
contributions by Jon Hassell, Daniel Lanois, Bono, and Eno.
