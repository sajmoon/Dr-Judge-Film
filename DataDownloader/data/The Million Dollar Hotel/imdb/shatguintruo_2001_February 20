2001_February 20 

There is a latin locution that applies oneself to this film: &quot;est modus in
rebus&quot; (it's necessary moderation in all the things). Indeed, Win Wenders
didn't know how to restrain the perpetrated excesses by the cast in the
composition of their characteres: rather than expressing their inner soul
conflicts, bestowed them a coarse and medieval pantomime.
Mel Gibson seems to be profoundly bores and struggles as not to say :&quot;Hey! I
have directed movies before and that's certainly not the way a crew should
represent!&quot;...
His inalterable face expression, just like a wax museum mask leads us to
deduce that...
Regretfully in all aspects such a director who had offered us wine
(excellent, by the way): &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, now offers us water
(brackish)...
Most certainly one of the worst movies of 2000.
