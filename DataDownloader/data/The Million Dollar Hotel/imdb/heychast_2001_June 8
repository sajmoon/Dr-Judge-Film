I was sadly disappointed to find out that this movie was going straight
to
video.  Being a long time U2 fan, I really wanted to enjoy Bono's vision
on
the big screen.  Now that I have enjoyed this film in the privacy of my
own
home, I am saddened that more will not get to see it.  It is high on my
recommendation list for anyone who enjoys a sense of magic in their
reality.
