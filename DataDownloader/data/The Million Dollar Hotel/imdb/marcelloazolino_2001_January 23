I have seen The million dollar hotel , and I think that It has everything
to be a big blockbuster film ,Mel Gibson ,Bono script.
But behind everything a weird story gives you a strange feeling that your
watching a very deep film.The story of this movie turns about a suicide of
an insane in The million dollar hotel.The movie is dark and very sad.You
went out of the cinema &quot;heavy&quot;.It's not a good experience.
