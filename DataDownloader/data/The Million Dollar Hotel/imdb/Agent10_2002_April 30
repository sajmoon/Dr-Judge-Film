After waiting a year fro this movie to 
come out, I was forced to watch it on 
video. It was worth the wait to say the 
least, but this is a film that is quite flawed. 
Wim Wenders has made a living doing 
off-beat films such as this, but this one 
tends to lack for some reason. Sometimes 
the intersecting stories seem awkward, or 
Tom Tom is just a little too dysfunctional or 
Mel Gibson seems too cranky. Donal Logue 
was excellent, and the scene at the end of the 
film with Jeremy Davies and Tim Roth is amazing. 
If the entire movie had managed to capture 
that essence and power, it would certainly 
have been a better movie. But instead, it turns 
into some unusual video for weird electronic 
music and U2.
