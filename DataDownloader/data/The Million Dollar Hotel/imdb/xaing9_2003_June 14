I like the feel of this movie. Even though it is dark, it is surprisingly
wicked awesome. There are lots of hot chicks in it. And i went through a
case and a half of beers while looking at it. You can feel like you are
living in the hotel also. And you can be all like &quot;milla is SO hott!&quot;...
Also, Mel Gibson is in this movie. And the wuss from Saving Private Ryan.
Do
you like movies that are different from other movies? Well, then... go
ahead
and look at this movie one time. You know you want to. And you also know
that reading books is for loosers. So get out there and take control of
your
pathetic life, and don't forget to buy some pretzels to go with your
beers!
I'm going a hot dog eating contest now... bye!
