There's a surprising, hard-to-resist charm to this daffy, palpably<br /><br />heartfelt romanticization of Los Angeles' Skid Row. The director,<br /><br />Wim Wenders, has a faster and lighter touch than he has in recent<br /><br />years (aided by his BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB?); this mystery<br /><br />about a suicide that might be a murder in an L.A. welfare hotel has<br /><br />some of the sweet delirium of a good Alan Rudolph movie. Jeremy<br /><br />Davies is the idjit best friend of the deceased heir to a billionaire;<br /><br />his Gumpesque twitches and smirks are tolerable for the movie's<br /><br />first half, then start to grate. Davies doesn't do wonders for his<br /><br />opposite number, a bookworm fruitcake and vision of heaven<br /><br />played mostly superbly by Milla Jovovich. (The Milla has problems<br /><br />when Davies pulls her into a tic-fest. The two of them seem to love<br /><br />playing retards jumping up and down on a bed.) And the sleuth<br /><br />sniffing out the mystery is a ramrod-straight, neck-brace-wearing<br /><br />Mel Gibson. His detective sneers at the down-and-out wackos,<br /><br />and one senses an unconscious irony: Gibson the mega-movie<br /><br />star is also uncomfortably out of place in this quintessentially indie<br /><br />cosmos.<br /><br />Stiff and gradually psychotic, like a cross between Oliver Stone's<br /><br />Nixon and his own Martin Briggs, Gibson gives one of his best<br /><br />performances. (Gibson has attacked the movie in the press as<br /><br />being &quot;as boring as a dog's ass.&quot; I am willing to accept Gibson's<br /><br />awareness of the level of interest of a dog's ass; movies, not so<br /><br />much.) And Wenders and the great cinematographer Phedon<br /><br />Papamichel (who shot Todd Haynes' SAFE and Bruce Wagner's<br /><br />WILD PALMS) give the scummy locations a freaky, almost<br /><br />offensive luminousness. (This is one of the most beautiful-looking<br /><br />movies about Los Angeles in many, many years.) There's more<br /><br />than a touch of Bukowski-style wishful thinking in this movie's<br /><br />gallery of lovable losers. But so what? It charms, it works, and<br /><br />what a fantastic bunch of losers! As a guy who thinks he's the sixth<br /><br />Beatle, Peter Stormare has never been so appealing. And Harris<br /><br />Yulin, reprising his cold, corrupt dude from DePalma's SCARFACE<br /><br />in a tycoon's clothing, proves that he can put icicles on even the<br /><br />most perfunctory dialogue. THE MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL is full of<br /><br />stuff that can make you roll your eyes,  but it's probably Wenders'<br /><br />most fully realized and most captivating movie since WINGS OF<br /><br />DESIRE.
