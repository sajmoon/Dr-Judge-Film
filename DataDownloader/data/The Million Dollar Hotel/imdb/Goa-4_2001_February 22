2001_February 22 

I saw this movie over 3 evenings, because i was bored to death. This is one
of the most boring movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />The story is ridiculous, the acting is boring. This movie is for meditation
only (or if you can't sleep, this one will make you)<br /><br />The plot.....was there one ?<br /><br />All the lines of the Actors is whispered very low and very slowly, you
can't
hear all the words, but after a few minutes you don't care
anyway.<br /><br />The music fits the movie very well. I was so close to have stopped this
movie, but i thought that there would be a point watching it to the end.
I'm
sorry to say, that i just wasted 3 evenings on this crap.<br /><br />There was a person which wrote in a review on IMDB, that the movie
questions: Who is mad ? I think it's certainly the director and the other
people involved in making this movie.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 of 10, but perhaps it deserves 1,5.
zzzZZZzzz
