This is really a crazy movie,i would never have seen or heard about it if
my
mother havent bought it for me.In a scale of 10 i would give it a 5,its a
mediocre movie,the main characters are crazy,and its rythm is lame.Even so
i
dont know why i enjoyed this movie,its got somekind of art,i really hated
that tom tom,his love story is also lame,but behind that theres a so so
detective story and a good soundtrack.You also get to see a busted Mel
Gibson playing a secondary role.The best thing of this movie is the
soundtrack,i never heard about the director before,overall its good and
bad
at the same time,its just mediocre.I wouldnt buy this movie for my
collection,but since its here i dont mind that it stays.
