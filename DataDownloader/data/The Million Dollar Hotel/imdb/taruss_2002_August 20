2002_August 20 

I had never heard of this film. I was just perusing the cheap DVD rentals
and saw this one. I knew I had never seen it, and was not sure it was going
to be that great from reading the box, but thought, heck, there was not all
than many others I had not seen, so decided to give it a
try.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought it was well directed, well acted,
and a great script. The music was great also, went well with what was going
on during the movie. There was a lot of talent involved in the making of
this movie.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best movies I have seen in several years. So
very interesting, so much different than any movies in awhile. If I had to
compare it to another movie, I suppose it is like taking &quot;The Grand Hotel,&quot;
just pushing the envelope a lot farther. Really on the dark side, but such a
great love story. The characters were very interesting and really
believable. The action, especially in the background, was so interesting to
watch.<br /><br />I give this a gold star for effort, a gold star for result, and a gold star
for innovation. Rent it, and see it for what it is, an interesting story
about some interesting characters told in an interesting
way.
