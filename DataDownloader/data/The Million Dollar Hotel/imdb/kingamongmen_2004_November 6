The Million Dollar Hotel was a very good movie. I was surprised by the
number of people that reviewed the movie, on this page, as a bad movie.
As something that they could not understand. To each their own, I
guess. For the rest of you that are interested in a good movie, rent
this movie at least. Give it a shot. The acting was superb, by all
members of the cast. The visuals for the movie are also great in the
ways that some shots were taken and edited.<br /><br />Apart from the great acting and great cinematic value of the film,
there was also the story. This was a perfect romantic drama that wasn't
too sappy or overdone. Don't be fooled to think that it is anything
other than a good movie.<br /><br />If its been a busy week and your looking to unwind with a good movie, I
highly suggest The Million Dollar Hotel. An over all good movie.
