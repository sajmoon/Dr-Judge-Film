This is one of the best movies i ever seen.I really believe that everybody
should see this one.
Milla Jovovich is great and the movie really gets inside
you.
A small story that works perfectly with the scenarios and the
psychotic
ambient.
Win Wenders still one of the best directors and Bono give some of his best
songs.
