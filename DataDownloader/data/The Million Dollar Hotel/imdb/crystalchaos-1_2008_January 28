Tom Tom plays such a riveting part in this film. I first saw it on the
Independent Film Channel and fell in love with it at first viewing. I
suggest that anyone who can see it should. It left me feeling thankful
for everything and seeing everything in brighter colors. I might be
only 16 but I am a deep lover of Independent Films and this along with
the movie Brick has to be my favorite movie of all time. Mel Gibson
plays a creepy yet intriguing part as the detective. The conflicts
between him and the major characters in this movie make it that much
more amazing. The dark cinematography mixed with the comedy of the half
insane characters makes for an interesting mix of a movie. I have
absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. I encourage that
everyone see this film if it were the last movie you ever watch. Every
time I watch it I find something else I love about it. And i have a
question too. Does Jeremy Davies have a mentally challenged brother or
sibling? Because he plays a crazy person all to well. Once again i love
this movie from its dark setting to its quirky characters and from its
well written screen play to its semi-amateur and simple script its a
perfect blend and everything an independent film should be.
