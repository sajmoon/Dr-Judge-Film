2002_April 4 

I loved this movie.  It's had a pretty common plot, but adding in the
little
bit about the people being slightly retarded
makes this movie better than any other.  I love ALL movies with Milla
Jovovich in it so this might have a little effect
on my rating but I don't think so.  I will love to watch this movie again
and again.  Many of my favorite quotes of all
time came for this
