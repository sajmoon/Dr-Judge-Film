WOW!!! Thankfully I only paid $5.50 for this movie at Wal-Mart. It
looked like something I would like...boy was I wrong. The only thing
more bizarre than this movie was why I watched it all the way through.
I guess I figured that I did pay for it and I should watch it all the
way through if I was going to comment on it. As the movie began I was
already regretting my decision to buy it and I almost pulled it out and
put in another movie. I hoped it would get better as it
progressed...but it didn&#39;t. It was poorly written, if you could call it
that. And the guy&#39;s voice narrating it was really creepy. I honestly
don&#39;t know what Mel Gibson was thinking agreeing to do this piece of
crap.
