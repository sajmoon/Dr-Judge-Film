First I&#39;ve screened this film on New Year&#39;2000 and 30 times since
then... Being a fan of Bono and Mr. Wender&#39;s direction I consider it to
be a very delicate work, the film is full of dramatic irony, romance
and humor and once you&#39;ve screened it you deeply fall in love with it.
This film made me change my mind and start my movie career.<br /><br />&quot;Wow, after I jumped it occurred to me life is perfect, life is the
best, full of magic, beauty, opportunity... and television... and
surprises, lots of surprises, yeah. And then there&#39;s the best stuff of
course, better than anything anyone ever made up, &#39;cause it&#39;s real.&quot;
