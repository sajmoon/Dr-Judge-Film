This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. It has a very strange,
original, beautiful, ugly, happy and sad story. It's not like anything I
have ever seen, I was very touched by this movie. I was very puzzled with
this movie, and I had to watch it alone, but it was worthy, It's the best
movie I have ever seen. Milla Jovovich proves herself as a good actress,
Jeremy Davies makes the most amazing part and Mel Gibson does the
strangest
character of his entire career.<br /><br />It's a Good movie, go see it :)
