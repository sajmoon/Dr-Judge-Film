I know a lot of people will see this movie, see the excellent acting in it,
and call it a good movie. They are wrong. While the entire cast does
themselves proud, this movie is still a creeping, too long boring crap ride
of stink. Remember what &quot;Mosquito Coast&quot; taught us, a confusing movie does
not mean art.
