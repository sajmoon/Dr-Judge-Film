(&quot;8 Mile,&quot; &quot;Wonder Boys,&quot; &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;) from a screenplay by
Oscar nominee Susannah Grant (&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;). &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; is the
alternately hilarious and heart-rending story of two sisters (Cameron
Diaz and Toni Collette) with nothing in common When four young divers
discover a legendary shipwreck rumored to contain millions in gold at
the bottom of the sea, they believe their dream of buried treasure has
come true. But nearby on the ocean floor, a sunken plane full of
illegal cargo threatens their find, and one of the friends makes a
fatal decision that quickly turns the treasure hunters into the
hunted...
