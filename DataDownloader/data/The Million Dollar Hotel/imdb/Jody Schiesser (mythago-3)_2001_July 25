Wow, this movie is pretty incredible, unique, beautiful.  Especially the
character Tom (played by Jeremy Davies).<br /><br />Still reeling from its beauty, which really, was in all the little
details.
It was made like a dream, some characters over the top, some more real
than
real.<br /><br />See it if you can.
