2001_December 1 

I bought this film &quot;pre-viewed&quot; on DVD because of Mel Gibson's face on the
front cover and the promise of bonus features on the back. After watching
it, I wondered if it was released on the heels of 9-11, as nothing else
could quite explain why I had never even heard a one-liner about this fresh
film with it's very believable, and wonderfully eccentric characters. The
cast is first rate; Mel Gibson in his most complex role to date; Jimmy
Smits, an absolute natural; Gloria Stewart (Titanic), Amanda Plummer, (The
Fisher King; Freejack)  Peter Stormare, (Chocolat; Armageddon) Julian Sands
(Boxing Helena) and even Bud Cort (Harold and Maude; Pollock) support the
two leads, Jeremy Davies,  (Saving Pvt. Ryan) and Milla Jovovich. (The
Messenger; Zoolander)<br /><br />The DVD is a treat with U2's haunting song &quot;The ground beneath her feet&quot;
the
perfect accompaniment to the opening menu, as it sets the tone for the film
beautifully. (Ok, I'm conveniently ignoring the opening song, &quot;The First
Time,&quot;
as well as the actual opening shot, but after that ordinary opening, the
movie gets deep and interesting quickly.)<br /><br />When we first meet &quot;Tom Tom,&quot; he is preparing to jump off the roof of the
&quot;Million Dollar Hotel.&quot; As he runs across the roof and launches himself
through the air, our emotions are still not with him, for we only know
three
things about him, 1.) he looks peculiar, 2.) He is throwing himself off the
roof of a hotel in some big city and 3.) he has not connected with us on a
human level... As he sails spread-eagled through the air, we hear his voice
proclaim: &quot;Wow, after I jumped, it occurred to me... life is perfect.&quot; From
that narrative voice and beyond, this film sucks you into the lives of  the
&quot;Beggar's Butler,&quot; a retarded man and splendid mimic played to perfection
by
Davies,  and the girl of his modest dreams, Eloise, played by Milla
Jovovich. Tom Tom's best friend, Izzy Goldkiss (Tim Roth) died from a fall
from the same roof and special agent Skinner (Gibson) is brought in by
media
mogul and Izzy dad, Stanley Goldkiss to find or frame a killer. The
residents band together to stand up to Skinner and perhaps make a few
dollars for themselves in the process. The film is well acted and
unpredictable and by the time we watch Tom launch himself over the edge at
the film's conclusion, we have come to care - to really care - about this
human being and the motley crew of characters who people his world, and
that
brings a genuine welling of emotion and a spilling of tears. Not many films
today can claim as much.
