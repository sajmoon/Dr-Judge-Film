Bono strokes his ego with this exercise in garbage.<br /><br />Formula: Write several annoying and unwatchable characters: claim they
are quirky and eccentric.<br /><br />Write smug, forced dialogue and call it satirical or self-effacing.
Look how interesting Tom Tom is, don't you know he is bizarre but real?
Bono wrote that, he's European so its intellectual.<br /><br />Hire an overrated has-been European (very important)director. Revolve
this around a meandering plot that gets wrapped up in 10 minutes at the
end of the film.<br /><br />Release said garbage to the public, flop critically and commercially,
have ingratiating director/actor/waiter wannabe's to talk about the
film's &quot;magical lyricism&quot; or &quot;neo-realism&quot; or how the film is a
&quot;journey&quot;....etc.<br /><br />If the future of the film industry is based on people who gave this
more than 3 stars, then buckle up. &quot;Far Away, So Close&quot; will seem like
&quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Every movie will be a preen-fest
written by uneducated foreign rock stars.<br /><br />Unwatchable crap from untalented jerks for unbearable snobs.
