2000_December 3 

OK, I admit it - I was a victim of all that bad word of mouth about this
movie. Now I am very pleasantly surprised and I feel something like
obligation to put some comment here at least. The Million Dollar Hotel is
not only a typical Wenders film - it is one of his best ones. Not only the
direction here is great - the same can be said about cinematography
(although the cameraman is not Roby Mueller, this guy Papamichael is not
worse), the design and especially about the acting. Of course, the music is
great. I watched this film in a very large cinema-hall - with some 4000
people around. And noone seemed to be bored or disappointed.
This is a perfect movie about America - and once again, it is made not by
Americans - the plot is by an irish musician, the director is German, and
one of the leads (Jovovich) is Ukrainian.
I give The Million Dollar Hotel 8 out of 10. It could be better film, of
course, but it could be a lot worse. Not to be missed. Not to be watched on
VHS - the large screen is needed here.
