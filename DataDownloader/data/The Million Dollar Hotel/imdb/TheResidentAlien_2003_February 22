I saw this film because I'm a huge Milla Jovovich fan.  I saw her first
in
Resident Evil, and have since seen many more of her great films.  Every
time
she has proven herself to be a great talent, but this time she has outdone
herself.  Her character, Eloise, was a troubled young prostitute who
called
the The Million Dollar Hotel home.  And she was one of the many characters
to get involved in the mysterious death of Israel Goldkist, the son of a
billionaire who also lived in the hotel.  When Special agent Detective
Skinner of the FBI (Mel Gibson) comes to investigate Israel's death, the
lives of the hotel's tenants are changed forever.
Tom Tom, a young retard that lived in the hotel and was best friend to
Israel, falls in love with Eloise, but will their love be able to
survive?
This story was wonderfully written.  It was co-written by U2's Bono, who
also sang the beautiful songs for the film.  The soundtrack lends to the
excellent atmosphere.  The feeling of sadness and poverty in his lyrics is
deeply touching.
Wim Wenders imagined a dark, gritty setting for this tragic tale.  This
was
brought to film with amazing skill.  I have seen few films that have ever
looked this good.  It's dark, but the camera angles are always so unique,
and so interesting, that they always capture, and hold the attention of
the
viewer.
The acting was top notch.  All of the actors did an excellent job.  I even
thought Mel Gibson did a great job, and he normally disappoints
me.
An excellent film, that ranks among one of the best of all time.  I'd say
see it immediately.
