This is a very difficult film to like I think, I mean is great, a
different story but the film is hard to digest, It submerge you in the
mind of the weird characters.<br /><br />The music is good, I don't love U2 or Bono in that case, but he does a
good job singing other people songs, like satellite of love, he nail
it, Milla does it better but he did a very good job.<br /><br />It all begin when Izzy fall of a building, Izzy's father was a rich and
famous person but Izzy lived like a bum in a crappy building and have a
bad drug addiction, anyway a detective (Mel Gibson) came to solve a
murder that nobody did, but there was a big secret within the people
that live in the building that had nothing to do with Izzy's dead but
it complicated the investigation, as the investigation continue Tom Tom
(Jeremy Davies) fall in love with Eloise (Milla Jovovich) and she
started to like him. More than a love story is a search to begin to
understand what life is all about for anyone.<br /><br />I really liked this film I don't care what other people say, watch it
if you can handle it.
