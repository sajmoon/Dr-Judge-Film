Hmmm, something about this film didn't really click with me. Maybe I
couldn't relate to any of the characters, but that wouldn't be too much of a
surprise since they are all self-confessed &quot;noodle-heads&quot;. There are a few
chuckles, but the idea of sitting through two hours of watching a bunch of
retarded numbskulls playing out the solving of a murder mystery in agonising
slowness was not a good one. These characters take about 15 minutes to act
out a two-line scene just because of all their mannerisms and spasticisms or
whatever the technical term is. There is a romantic subplot which is mildly
interesting, but in all honesty I can't see why anyone would give a hoot
about who actually committed the murder. We don't even get to know anything
about the victim - fatal error. Oh and Mel Gibson's character was shrouded
in mystery, all well and good, but if you don't unshroud him you just leave
pure frustration for the audience. Apart from a couple of laughs and a
spattering of nice shots or cinematic moments, this film is utter tripe and
should be lobbed bin-wards with all haste. 4/10, see, I'm
generous.
