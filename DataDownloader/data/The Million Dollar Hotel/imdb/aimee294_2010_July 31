2010_July 31 
I got this film because I liked all the faces on the front of the box
and the plot really pulled me in but to be honest you need to be in the
right kind of mood to watch this film because you will fined its a bit
on the strange side of this. Also in parts it tends to drag but over
all I really did like this film but then again if I was to see it a
second time I might change my mined. I do really like how we first meet
the main character &#x22;Tom Tom&#x22; with this surprising leap off a building
witch make you thing &#x22;huh?&#x22; and also makes you want to keep watching.
As I got through most of the film I started to get a little bored but
was determined to watch the hole thing and I&#x27;m glad I did because
towards the end it got really good and ended leaving me with a lot of
unanswered questions. This film might seam like a drama but it also
made me laugh in bits where other people may have stayed silent witch I
really like. I thought the acting was amazing and I must say it is
definitely a film to watch.
