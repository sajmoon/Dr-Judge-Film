This movie was definitely not one of the greatest, yeah it had some
cool fighting scenes and action, but it lacked so much more. As I was
watching this movie I felt like it was just a bunch of people throwing
a movie together on anything they could to try and make some money. The
zombies looked terrible, the first resident evil movie they have people
missing half of their faces and blood dripping, but you this one you
can notice its people in masks. This movie was the bare minimum hour
and 30 minutes long, about 15minutes of that hour and 30 was straight
driving scenes, not exciting driving scenes... its just people driving.
Over all unless your a huge Resident Evil fan i wouldn&#39;t suggest
wasting your time.
