Films adapted from video games generally have received flak mainly for
their inability to cater to a larger audience than a specified niche
among the audience - mainly teenage boys who spend their free time in
front of, eh, video games. It&#39;s always a case of you either you like it
or you don&#39;t.<br /><br />Having said that, I enjoyed the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (I was 17 then)
and marginally liked &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; (I was 19): partly
because I was someone who has had an on-off affair with role-playing
games (RPGs), specifically with the PS2 console; but mostly because I
understood that these kind of movies required no life-affirming
morales, no intricate plot, no credible science to provide mental
calisthenics. Just pure popcorn entertainment and an unabashed sense of
escapism for them to work. Considering these aspects, it&#39;s not much to
ask.<br /><br />But then comes &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, a third-tier installment
(apparently the year of thirds hasn&#39;t ended yet) that&#39;s so painfully
unexciting, it&#39;s not just comparable to having to watch someone else
play the game; it&#39;s like having to watch someone play the game using a
walkthrough downloaded from some gaming forum. Everything&#39;s too
perfunctory and the scare factor is conspicuously several notches
lower.<br /><br />Here, Milla Jovovich returns as zombie butt-whooping Alice, five years
after the first film, when the Umbrella Corporation&#39;s T-Virus has
escaped Racoon City and has set humankind into the brink of extinction.
Together with a band of survivors that includes a sleepwalking cast of
Ali Larter, Ashanti, Oded Fehr and, pity, Spencer Locke, they cross the
desert to get to Alaska, which may be their final frontier.<br /><br />Writer Paul W.S. Anderson and director Russell Mulcahy doesn&#39;t provide
the story with any interesting characters and their treatment of the
material is so half-hearted you barely feel the plot as it advances
from one point to another. Jovovich still provides a solid central
figure but her ho-hum action scenes can&#39;t make up for an overall
lackluster film.<br /><br />But really, when you&#39;re a 20-something male and the best thing you can
find about a zombie movie is teen actress Spencer Locke, then there&#39;s
really not much good going on.
