I&#39;ve no idea why I attempted watching this cheap and greasy movie,
knowing how nauseatingly bad was the sequel. Anyway, I&#39;ve quit after
about 2/3 of it and I wish I haven&#39;t even started. It is yet another
collection of bad horror clich&eacute;s, preposterous actors and ridiculous
stunts. Apparently the only person impressed by all that was the
cameraman and maybe the editors, who altogether made it even more
unwatchable.<br /><br />P.S. Looking at the number of 10&#39;s given to this movie my best guess is
that all those miserable extras who played zombies are all registered
on IMDb and obviously adore their own &quot;acting&quot;.
