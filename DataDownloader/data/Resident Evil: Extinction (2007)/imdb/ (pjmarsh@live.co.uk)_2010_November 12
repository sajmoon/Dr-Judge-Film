Sunshine? Sand? Las Vegas? Sounds like the perfect holiday... but not
in Resident Evil Extinction! This is the world where ravenous zombies
attack in broad daylight.<br /><br />Resident Evil Extinction definitely takes the zombie genre in a new
direction, breaking the conventions of the usual films in this
category. Gone are the days where zombies roam dark, fog laden roads,
where the survivors have only everyday items as weapons, where the
zombies are the primary threat...<br /><br />The film uses wide camera angles to show the isolation of the last
strand of survivors in this desolate environment. The cinematography is
beautiful, from the wide open plains of the Nevada desert to the
confined spaces of an Umbrella Corporation facility.<br /><br />The soundtrack follows a similar style from the last two films, with
pounding techno-rock numbers that really get the blood pumping and
mirror the relentless action that&#x27;s on screen.<br /><br />Overall, this film follows the style over substance feel that the
series has followed since day one however, it&#x27;s one of those films you
can watch with little thought. Pure entertainment! Worth a watch.
