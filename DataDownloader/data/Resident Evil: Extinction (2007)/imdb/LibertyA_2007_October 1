Resident Evil: Extinction is a fantastic follow up of Resident Evil and
Resident evil: Apocalypse. Now, I have been quite a fan of the games
since I played Resident Evil on the playstation. I watched the movies,
think they are fantastic, then I come onto the internet to only find
people complaining about how the movies are not like the games. I would
only like to point out something: Why would CAPCOM allow the producer&#39;s
of the movies to make the movies the same as the games? That would just
hurt the marketing of their games, and bore the living hell out of the
viewers because we&#39;ve &#39;been there, done that&#39;. I don&#39;t want to see a
movie that I already know what is going to happen. Let&#39;s face it, if
they took that route, then the movie would probably have big plot holes
due to cutting down 15 hours of gameplay into a One and a half hour
movie, and would not get rated high. The film makers have taken
different elements of the Resident Evil games, and combined it with
their own, to make a interesting, unique zombie Trilogy.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction is set five years later after the destruction
of Racoon City. Unfortunately, the horrid &#39;T-Virus&#39; did not get
contained, and the whole earth has now been overrun by the virus,
turning everyone into the living dead. Even most of the world&#39;s water
has dried up. Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr),
L.J (Mike Epps), K-Mart (Spencer Locke) and Nurse Betty (Ashanti) are
traveling through the Nevada in a Convoy with other survivor&#39;s. Alice
(Milla Jovovich) has separated herself from the group to carry out her
own personal Vendetta against the evil Dr. Isaac&#39;s (Ian Glen) and the
Umbrella Corporation. Alice finds the Convoy, and tells Claire about
how there is possible survivor&#39;s in Alaska, making a new goal for the
Convoy.<br /><br />Now the acting for the movie is pretty good. Not great, but good. It is
what you would expect from a horror action movie. Some character&#39;s give
a weak, yet passable job, such as Ashanti, and Spencer Locke. With
Milla, its hard to tell. I don&#39;t know if her character is just a stiff
character, or if Milla is just playing Milla, because all her
character&#39;s seem to be the same. Either way, Milla work&#39;s for me, and
does a good job.<br /><br />The action in this movie is great. It is a bit of a combination of the
first Resident Evil, and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Resident Evil one
based more on horror, and less action. Resident Evil: Apocalypse got
rid of some of the horror, and replaced it with cheesy, yet fun, over
the top action. In Extinction, it is a combination of the first and
second movie, and work&#39;s very well.<br /><br />With the way this movie ends, I pray to god we get a sequel, and it
better be as good as this one, if not, better. If there doesn&#39;t end up
being a sequel, I take my 10 star&#39;s down to a 1.
