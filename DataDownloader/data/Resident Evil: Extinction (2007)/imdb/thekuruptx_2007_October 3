Look guys i don&#39;t know ....what u saw in the movie ....but it ain&#39;t
nothing good...for what i can say. i mean first of all the movie was a
roller-coaster ride...yeah but when it starts its you feel to throw up.<br /><br />the geography,the links,the storyline is all bogus.. i mean ...Earth is
Dead , continental drifts occurred Eiffel tower,Liberty statue,Pyramids
and sphinxes all in a single place...but hell yeah Vegas(location) is
where it was supposed to be..<br /><br />In movie 1,the first part, Alice is in the Mansion when the troops
crash in and take her deep into the Hive and there they enter the laser
room and are killed...<br /><br />But here Isaacs kicks Alice in the mansion and she crashes into the
next room and there &quot;Presto&quot; the room has emerged.<br /><br />about the story .... I seriously think that the storyline editor has
some major issues i mean Alice has telekinesis or something which are
not even considered in RE1 and RE2.<br /><br />i mean it seems that the storyline editor was creating the story and
he/she saw some flaws and hence added some features to seemingly put
the movie in flow.<br /><br />apart from that the movie action scenes were good . but the
wardrobe...i mean cmon it was like watching Van Damms Cyborg....<br /><br />I don&#39;t know but ALi larter made a bad choice by joining the movie a
speck...on her career i fair.<br /><br />the movie literally wanted me to poke a finger in my mouth and throw up<br /><br />5/10 (for the camera work and action)
