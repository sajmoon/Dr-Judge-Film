Well, I just watched RE 3.. and I really have to say the writer (some
Paul Anderson, apparently) does deserve credit for taking his
profession to a whole new level. Seriously, he achieved something DJ
Shadow did for music back in the days: making a whole album/script out
of samples, without ever using one bit of content he came up with
himself. Just that for a film, this concept somehow doesn&#39;t seem to
work as well as it did for electronic music. The most obvious ripoff,
as others have remarked before me, is of course from Day of the Dead -
RE 3 is in fact barely short of qualifying as a remake: cf. the
underground base with the zombies around the elevator area, the
virtually identical telephone-scene with the &quot;educated&quot; zombie and the
mad scientist etc., etc. But by no means does it end there. Other
&quot;featured&quot; movies would include Mad Max, Alien(s), Matrix, X-Men, even
The Birds... you name it. Virtually every scene feels like you have
seen it somewhere else before, and as usual the originals were somewhat
better.<br /><br />To be honest, apart from this, it wasn&#39;t that bad. Holes in the plot
are frequent, yet not big enough to earnestly distract you, and
dialog/acting is not bad enough to ruin the tension. Alongside low
expectations, not having any relations to either the series or the game
plus having a soft spot for Milla Jovovich (I loved the 5th element
when it first came out) certainly helped making this flick quite
tolerable for me. All in all, I felt adequately entertained, which
after all is about the only reason one would watch an action/horror
flick like this. Clearly in the &quot;If You Got Nothing Else To Do, Might
As Well Give It A Try&quot;-category, 4/10 from me.
