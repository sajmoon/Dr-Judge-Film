Time and again the recipe American movie revolves around guns, gasoline
and military like organisms. It is getting more ridiculous still when
the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. They don&#39;t have
food, water or any future, but they always have plenty of gas and
bullets.<br /><br />This part of the series takes bad writing to extinction. Alice has
psychic powers and she uses them about three times in the whole movie,
four if you count sleepwalking (sleeppsyching? :) ) with only one
significant result. Everybody else dies, either stupidly, heroically or
semantically (they leave for Alaska which is remote, but still in the
States. There is no reason to destroy the world if you can&#39;t be
patriotic :). Also, the good psychotic doctor also becomes some mutated
monster, then dies.<br /><br />Also, being a front girl for a cosmetic company has its downfalls as
well: poor Milla looks like she has smooth plastic skin.<br /><br />Bottom line: the first movie was fun, based on the game; the second was
a bit stretched, but still entertaining enough; the third is a waste of
time.
