You have got to see this movie it is way better than the first one and
second one. This movie is action packed and Alice kicks ass in this
movie, so please see it. You should take your family and kids and see
this movie you will enjoy this movie. I must say the first Resident
Evil I saw was on DVD and the second one I saw was in the theaters.
When I saw the second one there were not a lot of people seeing RE 2,
but when it came to Resident Evil Extinction it was packed there with
lots of people saying this movie kicked ass and I agree with them this
is by far the best movie I have ever seen. So if your ever into horror
films Resident Evil Extinction is a must see movie and trust me you are
going to like this movie.
