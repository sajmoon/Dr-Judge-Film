Resident Evil Extinction is better than Apocalypse, but still makes me
think that why they do that? And it is very frustrating that in IMDb,
there are a lot of good movies whose ratings are less than Extinction,
but deserve much more. The opening scene of the movie aims to surprise
audience, but it cannot. There are only two things good in this movie,
the panoramic views and the cinematography, you know post apocalyptic,
a movie in dust and dirt. The abominable family at the beginnings
recall Judge Dredd (or let&#x27;s say Chronicles of Riddick) and it was
exciting. The second and third Resident Evil movies do not focus on the
battle between Alice (and other humans) and zombies, there are awful
sub stories and characters instead. However, when I saw that the
director of Extinction is Russell Mulcahy, I got hopeful, because he
made enjoyable B movies like Highlander. However, he disappointed me,
why? I will tell you why, because I know, the script. As said, in terms
of direction, this is much more better than the second, but still this
is not a well executed movie. Returning to the story, the people who
hunt zombies for fun from a convoy was clich&#xE9; (already used by Romero
in Land of the Dead), but at least it is fun. The best part of the
movie begins, when they arrive at New York. However, zombies&#x27;s make up
effects are awful, there are time-lapse shots which good news for 28
Days Later fans, but very bad news for Resident Evil fans. Again a
slightly entertaining, but entertaining, but not well executed part.
The monster of Extinction is not as ridiculous as Nemesis, but still
very uninspiring, terrible looking. If you would know who turns into a
monster, don&#x27;t worry, it is not Alice. Why we cannot see an appealing
creature in R.E. movies?
