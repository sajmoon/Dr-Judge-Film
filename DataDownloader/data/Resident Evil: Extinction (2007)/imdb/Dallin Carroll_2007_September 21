If I wanted to watch 95 minutes of loud noises, I would&#39;ve went on
youtube and watched one of those shock videos over and over again every
10 minutes. At least in the previous movie there was things going on.
In this one, they were either sitting on their asses or slowly walking
down a hallway, pausing, and getting attacked by a zombie. Seriously,
there could&#39;ve been less of this. Would it&#39;ve killed them to actually
show the zombie sneaking up before them? Or growling a bit before they
screeched at the top of their lungs? I sat by a damn speaker, for
crying out loud.<br /><br />I mean yeah, it&#39;s nice to have a loud, shocking noise every once in a
while but this movie relied on it. I couldn&#39;t count the amount of
these. Someone could die of a heart attack watching this. I&#39;m fifteen
and my heart is still beating fast. What happens when a 60 year old has
a heart attack? Then they have a lawsuit on their hands. This movie was
horrible, and it just goes to show that loud noises don&#39;t make a zombie
movie good- the actions of the characters and zombies do. By the way,
here&#39;s a heads up: Don&#39;t get excited about seeing huge crowds of
zombies.
