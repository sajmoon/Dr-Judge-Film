Alright, I know a lot of people don&#39;t like the second part of the
movie. I also know that the very same people do like the first part. I
just love the second part, &#39;couse it&#39;s a lot closer to my favorite
Resident Evil 3: NEMESIS. And I do like the first part. So people, can
anyone tell me, why Extinction is so...full of crap? I mean hey, what
the heck is this movie talking about? What&#39;s up with all this clones?
I&#39;m expecting the next part of the movie to be titled as &quot;Attack of the
clones&quot;. I&#39;ve watched it twice and still can&#39;t understand anything. In
this new RE, the new director somehow managed to get every single crap
from the previous parts and put them together here. I&#39;m really shocked.
All my little but still breathing hopes die in vain after the first few
minutes. And...till the end. I&#39;ve never seen so much stupidness in one
place, honestly. Mila rulz :)
