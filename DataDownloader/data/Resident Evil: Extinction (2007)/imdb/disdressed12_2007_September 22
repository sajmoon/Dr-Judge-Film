i thought this was the best of the Resident Evil franchise.the action
was more intense,the fight scenes were away more spectacular and i also
really liked the music.obviously,it&#39;s not original,bearing many
similarities to the first two.and it does borrow heavily from other
movies.but still,it is an entertaining romp.i think it is much more
gory and graphic than the first two.this is just an observation.it
didn&#39;t really bother me.this is the first resident Evil movie i have
seen on the big screen,and if you have a chance to watch it in the
theatre,i think it&#39;s worth it.it won&#39;t win any awards for deep
characterizations or storyline,but it really isn&#39;t that kind of
movie.it knows what it is and doesn&#39;t try to be anything else.i think
it does what it sets out to do,and that is to entertain.for me,Resident
Evil:Extinction is a definite 7/10
