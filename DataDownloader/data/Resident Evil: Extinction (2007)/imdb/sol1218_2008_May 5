**SPOILERS** A lot like the 1981 Mel Gibson apocalyptic auctioneer
&quot;Road Warrior&quot; the movie &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; has to do with an
experiment gone wrong; terribly wrong. <br /><br />Having mistakenly released the deadly T-Virus out of their main
laboratory in Racoon City the Umbrella Cooperation is now trying to
find an antidote to it in order to save the last few uninfected human
survivors still left. One of the head honcho&#39;s of the UC Dr. Isaacs,
Lain Glenn, is secretly experimenting with those infected by the
T-Virus in order the make them obedient slaves to their masters, the
cooperations, when and if a cure is found to keep, if not eradicate,
the T-Virus in check.<br /><br />The key to finding a cure for the T-Virus is the now escaped head of
security of the UC Alice, Milla Jouovich. Cloning scores of Alices&#39; by
Dr. Isaacs have all failed with them being killed, running through a
deadly obstacle course, in trying to find out that their a perfect
replication of Alice. It&#39;s the real Alice that Dr. Isaacs wants and to
find her he&#39;ll use every means at his disposal to track her down even
if it means going against the orders of his superiors at Umbrella
Corps.<br /><br />Alice after a close and deadly encounter with a number of flesh-eating
virus infected zombies and mutant wild dogs makes her way to this
caravan of human survivors in the Nevada Desert. It was while Alice was
out on her own she came across a booklet with transcribe radio
transmissions from Alaska. The radio transmissions say that Alaska is
the only place on earth that the T-Virus hasn&#39;t been able to penetrate.
Giving this very vital information to the leader of the desert caravan
Clair Redfield, Ali Larter, Alice has her decide to travel up north to
finally get away from then tens of thousands of flesh eating zombies
that roam the now almost totally deserted, of human beings, United
States.<br /><br />Exciting run to daylight by the trucks cars and oil-tanker of the, what
seems like, last human survivors of the continental US with tens of
thousands of zombies either hot on their tail or in their face. Alice &amp;
Clair gets the convoy as far as Las Vegas where it ends up being stuck
in five to ten feet of loose and shifting desert sands. <br /><br />Forced to make a stand the caravan survivors are almost wiped out by
the rampaging and almost unstoppable zombies thirsting for their flesh
since, from the looks of them, they haven&#39;t eaten in days. Alice saves
the day by getting the few survivors out and then together with Carlos,
Oden Fehr, runs the gantlet in smashing into the UC main headquarters
and experiment center just outside of Vegas.<br /><br />With the remaining survivors safely put on one of the UC helicopters
and out of harms way Alice makes her way into the heart of the
experiment center. It&#39;s there that she finds out what Dr. Isaacs, who
had morphed himself into an outer space alien-like monster, had planned
to do to both her as well as himself to, in his own unique and insane
way, single-handedly take over the world!<br /><br />The films confusing story is saved by its very effective and
heart-stopping action scenes. Alice with her both super 9mm automatics
and ferocious looking Gurkha bolo&#39;s, machetes, is more then a match for
the hundreds of wild and screaming zombies that she has no trouble at
all putting away. It&#39;s only later when Alice confronts the what seemed
to be indestructible Dr. Isaacs, looking like the intergalactic
stowaway monster in the movie &quot;Alien&quot;, that she finds she has her hands
full in trying to take him out. <br /><br />***SPOILERS**** It turns out that Alice has a friend that the
megalomaniac Dr. Issac had completely overlooked in his attempt to both
capture and, after he got what he wanted out of Alice, do her in. That
friend not only rescues Alice but together with her help will not only
put a stop to the rampaging T-Virus but the, what&#39;s left of them, top
men of the UC; who&#39;s mad and self-serving experiments had created it in
the first place.
