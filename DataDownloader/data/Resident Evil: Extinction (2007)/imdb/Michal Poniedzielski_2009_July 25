Mila Jovovich is to good for this movie. That&#x27;s for sure. Everything
else is just OK to construct long, boring, not funny when intended to,
and funny where should be frightening, crappy movie. I&#x27;m 26 and it
seems, that I&#x27;m too old for that movie. I&#x27;m serious. I should be 12 or
something. But than again - is there ANY reason for 12 year old human
being to litter his head with such a crap? Screenplay is... there&#x27;s
almost no screenplay. Directing is cheap. Acting smells like Beverly
Hills 90210 - you can hardly tell the difference between main
characters and zombies. Even special effects are... AT MOST OK. I&#x27;m
honest - it&#x27;s hard to watch this movie! I was waking up on few scenes
with half naked Mila, and that&#x27;s all! So, either you&#x27;re 26 or 12,
you&#x27;ll better see &#x22;28 Days Later&#x22;, &#x22;Mad Max&#x22;, &#x22;Convoy&#x22; and &#x22;The Birds&#x22;
- from those movies &#x22;Residnet Evil: Extinction&#x22; have taken A LOT and
ruined it! And Mila Jovovich form &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; :)
