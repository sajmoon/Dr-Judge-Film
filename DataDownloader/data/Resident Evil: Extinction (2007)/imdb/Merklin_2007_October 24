The first two resident evil movies weren&#39;t the most faithful of game
based movies .Resident evil: extinction is no different , but what it
lacks in staying true to its source material, it makes up for in being
fast and entertaining, if a little superficial. <br /><br />Its by no means perfect- there&#39;s more po faced exposition than actual
dialogue and despite there being a lot of characters fighting for
survival, there&#39;s no real character development or any of the sort of
drama you&#39;d expect from the scenario this film offers. But then again,
maybe asking that of resident evil: extinction is asking for too much.
This is this the kind of film where a sexy babe with two blades fights
zombies , evil crows and mutant dogs-which is an indication of what
you&#39;ll get with this.<br /><br />And speaking of sexy babes with blades, millia does her action hero
thing brilliantly . As usual she isn&#39;t given a huge stretch for her
acting muscles, but she kicks ass with conviction - which is a good
thing since this film is full of action.And that action is frequent,
entertaining and well directed (if a little shaky with the camera
work).<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t come close to any zombie movie classic i could name, but
resident evil: extinction is a competently handled, entertaining and
action packed film . Best of the resident evil movies.
