In &#x22;Resident Evil 3 - Extintction&#x22; Alice (Milla Jovovich) returns for
more action trying to lead a group of survivors to find a safe place
without the infection that almost destroyed mankind on Earth, now a
desertic and apocalyptical place to live among zombies. The third part
of the Resident Evil series is more light than the other films, less
scary, more funny, with great action sequences and the trademark is
present all the time, the famous headshots where you can say out loud
headshot after a zombie got killed just like in the video games. <br /><br />The movie is very short, everything goes for an hour and a half, the
plot is pretty much what I said and there&#x27;s not only the zombie danger
but also a creepy doctor (Iain Glen) that can control Alice in his new
experiment supported by some form of government. Meanwhile Alice teams
again with Carlos (Oded Fehr) and his friends on their way to Alaska
where it is said that the virus haven&#x27;t reached. Once again what makes
the film interesting in the scenes between Alice and Carlos along with
the group led by Ali Larter; the fights and shootouts against the
zombies, some moments by the annoying doctor. The best part is
definitely Carlos last moment, one of the most honorable moments for a
character ever, sad but truth.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and produced this third film and I really wish
I could direct it because I didn&#x27;t find the tension, the scary things
that made the first episode more interesting than this one. I&#x27;m not
saying that Russell Mulcahy is bad director but I felt that this film
is meant to be more like an action work than a horror film and we&#x27;re
talking about zombies, frightening creatures supposed to scare. On the
other hand the humor was vital to the film, some quotes and moments
were really funny which made of &#x22;Resident Evil 3&#x22; a enjoyable film. The
movie goes well but not enough to be the greatest of the series. 7/10
