So I just saw it and was severely disappointed after loving the first
two movies. This movie is nothing other a mixture of other classic
zombie movie plots. I suppose the writers thought that no one watches
the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series of movies anymore. This movie is
almost the same series of events that took place in the second movie of
the Living dead series. And using the chick from the other zombie
movies was a lame move there are other actresses that have not done
films in the zombie genre. Every time she was in scene I had to remind
myself of which movie I was watching since this movie also reminded me
of the other movie she was in.<br /><br />I really expected a lot more imagination from the movie. The events and
deaths are totally predictable and that pretty much defeats the purpose
of an action/horror type movie. I really expected a more interesting
ending as well.
