The movie trailers make you think that it takes place in Vegas are what
you&#39;d call a bait and switch. 3/4 of the way through the movie they
arrive in Vegas, but it&#39;s just through the center of the strip that has
been covered in sand. They get attacked by zombies and they move on. I
thought the backdrop for the movie was to be in Vegas and you&#39;d see
them in the casinos and around the hotels. Nope, none of that. In fact,
there was really no need to locate it in Vegas at all.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie is OK as far as zombie films go. However the
genre has just been done to death in the past five years. How many ways
can a virus/gas/substance turn people into flesh eating zombies or
vampires or werewolves. The genre itself has become like a zombie that
keeps rising again and again. Give it a rest for about 10 years.
