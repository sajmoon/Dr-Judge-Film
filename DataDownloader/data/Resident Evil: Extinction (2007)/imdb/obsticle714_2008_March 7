no character development at all ... good action i guess .. OK heres the
thing with this kind of movie its made for one reason because the
people who made it wanted money not because they thought it was an
interesting story or plot made straight from a best selling video game
... means its probably not gonna be a good movie ... like hit-man and
other movies like that . there are good movies made from video games
but this is not one of them . .. and now i just have to complete the
next few lines just so i am allowed to post this not to cool im not mad
about the movie but that it made top sci fi movies on IMDb any ways
hope you feel the same as me
