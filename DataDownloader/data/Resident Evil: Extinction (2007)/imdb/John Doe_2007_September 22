2007_September 22 
I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised, even though I read the book
months prior to the movie release. It was significantly better than its
prequel. The characters who died were actually likable, so you actually
felt sorry when they died. The scenes where people got eaten were also
a lot more gritty. Enough to make me cringe, and I was watching
Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 2 years old. The action scenes were
visually impressive as well. I will never look at a crow the same way
again.<br /><br />I loved this movie, but I gotta say, the best part was Iain Glenn. I&#39;m
not a fan of him, but he did an absolutely terrific job in this movie.
If you want a monster action/horror flick, this is the one for 2007.
