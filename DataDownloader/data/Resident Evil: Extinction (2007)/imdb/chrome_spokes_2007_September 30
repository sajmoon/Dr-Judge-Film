RE:E is entertaining and quirky in the spirit of the first Resident
Evil. Having been psychologically scarred for life by &quot;Ultraviolet,&quot; I
for one was all too wary of placing credence on Milla&#39;s name alone as
an indicator of a movie&#39;s quality. But, fortunately, RE:E comes
through. It is decent. Hooray. I think what makes the Resident Evil
franchise (the games and the films) successful in general is that it is
inventive and interesting. While RE:2 may have had the largest budget
of the series, it was bloated, plodding, and artistically threadbare.
With RE:E, you have a more refined and engaging film experience without
all the overpriced gimmicks. Yes, it could have been more, but, in
terms of expectations and actual product, I felt RE:E was rather well
done.
