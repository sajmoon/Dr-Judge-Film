After the second movie i was ready for this one to be cheap and
boring... But this film totally proved me wrong. It contains The plot
and suspense the first film had and the action the second film had.
Perfect combo! The story is beyond amazing, Very creepy in a way yet
totally awesome for the people in the theater watching it all play out.
An apocalyptic world with few human survivors banding together,
fighting, traveling etc. to try to find a place of safety from the
infection and all the dangers that come with it. I&#39;m guessing if your
on this page you have read the plot so Anyways back to the review. The
film was a pleasant surprise... though there was one setback, There
wasn&#39;t much time for any info or background on important members of the
convoy, all you know is they are there... Your not really given time to
hear a little out each one and kind of get each one to have there own
amount of screen time due to the lack of time the film was working
with, I mean come on... Why not make it 2 hours and add a little more
in? Anyways besides that i thought the movie was a blast to watch and i
am definitely going back to the theater sometime this weekend to see it
again...
