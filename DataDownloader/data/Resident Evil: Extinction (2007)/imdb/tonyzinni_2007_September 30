I went into the theater not expecting to much from this movie, and I
find it sad that it was still disappointing. Don&#39;t bother wasting your
money on this joke of a movie. If you must see it wait for it to come
out on video...please don&#39;t help the execs find an excuse by box office
receipts to make a fourth movie. There is no story to it, the dialogue
is poorly written, there are a few special effects that are descent.
You get the idea that Mila&#39;s character is very powerful creature, but
she only displays these powers two or three times. There are many plot
errors in this movie (one day perhaps writers will learn to research
what they are writing about as well as settings crew )I hope Mila will
be able to survive what these movies may do to her career.
