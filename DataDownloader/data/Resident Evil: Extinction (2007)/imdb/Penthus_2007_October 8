When I first saw Resident Evil I thought that they had destroyed a
classic , they didn&#39;t pay attention to the real game story and the
effects and the acting was thin. But after the second movie I thought
that they had done their job well, good effects and some of the real
game characters like Nemesis made the movie &quot;watchable&quot;. Now when the
third movie was released i was stunned, the effects and acting was
better than ever, and the whole thing with Clair Redfield and Carlos
etc was amazing, almost every game character was in the movie and they
were very much alike the characters in the game. This movie can of
course be watch by someone who hasn&#39;t played the game, but if you have
played it the storyline will be clearer. It&#39;s not a 10 because of the
end, to quick with out a real solution
