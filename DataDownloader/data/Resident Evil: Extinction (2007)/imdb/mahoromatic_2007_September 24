I&#39;ve been waiting for this follow-up from the moment i heard there
would Resident Evil 3 and ... it wasn&#39;t worth waiting. The movie itself
is brainless like a common zombie. There was no character development,
because people just kept dieing too fast. And it took so much time to
make movie like this? Ordinary action based movie without anything else
to enjoy.<br /><br />IMDb rating is far too high for Resident Evil:Extinction. Maybe
hardcore fans would give it a good rating,but common let&#39;s be serious
this is one of the worst sequels ever made. My rating 4out of 10 and
that&#39;s, because i liked first 2 parts.
