Like I already said: It&#39;s all about Milla. If you like her, you&#39;ll like
all three parts of Resident Evil trilogy.<br /><br />First of all, I&#39;m not Resident Evil games fan. I never played any of
these games, but I really like the whole Resident Evil movie trilogy. I
admit, it&#39;s more or less because of good looking and in every scene
sexy Milla. The same thing was with Underworld and Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />Bunch of people say Milla isn&#39;t any good as an actress. Well I don&#39;t
agree with that. She was great in the movies No Good Deed, Dazed and
Confused, Dummy (and of course Res. Evil) and is the main reason why so
many people watched these movies. I believe that the true reason why so
many people don&#39;t like her is because she isn&#39;t ambitious like, let&#39;s
say, Brad Pitt, Leonardo di Caprio, Keira Knightley etc. She is, in one
hand, synonym for B-movies, but Jason Statham and lot&#39;s of other good
actors are too. So does that makes them a bad actors? No, it doesn&#39;t.
They just act in the movies where they know they can be good and that
is the main reason why I respect them so much. They don&#39;t aim too high,
so they never end up short like some other &quot;great&quot; actors.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for some movie with good - looking actress, very
good action and lot&#39;s of fun, I believe you should watch the whole
trilogy. Just take the movies for what they really are, relax and enjoy
it. Like someone already said, it&#39;s a perfect popcorn trilogy.
