The quality of this movie is inversely proportional to your level of
education. If you like to go to the popcorn stadium to be inundated by
mediocre quality eye-candy with low expectations concerning plot,
continuity, scene quality, etc., then the movie rates 8 to 10. If you
have a discriminating view of what a movie ought to be, i.e. you can
tell the difference between good and bad acting, story-telling,
direction, costuming, etc., then this movie might rate a 3. If you see
this movie, prepare to suspend all disbelief, to accept the severely
flawed premise, and to ignore the impractical - even unappealing -
costumes. It helps to be unconditionally in love with Milla. Just
remember, Hollywood keeps producing garbage because people keep paying
big money to see garbage.
