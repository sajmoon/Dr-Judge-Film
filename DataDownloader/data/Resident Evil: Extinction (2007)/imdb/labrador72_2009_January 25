If the first 2 Resident Evil movies were an insult to survival horror,
the third one takes it to another level altogether: you&#39;ll have to be a
survival master to go through this piece of zombie junk without
considering slashing your wrists to put an end to your entertainment
misery.<br /><br />I understand we all need to earn some money for a living, I am just
hoping somebody will find Paul Anderson a job outside the movie
industry before he starts writing another Resident Evil script.<br /><br />I have to admit there were a couple of fright scenes that kept me from
going into a coma but the actual reason why I gave it 2 stars is
because Mila&#39;s acting is once again pretty good.
