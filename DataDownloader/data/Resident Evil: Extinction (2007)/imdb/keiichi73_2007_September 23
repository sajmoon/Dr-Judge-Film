When it comes to movie monsters, zombies never really appealed to me.
They seem to exist more as moving targets in a shooting gallery than
actual villains. And let&#39;s face it, just about everything you can do in
a zombie movie has already been done. Resident Evil: Extinction seems
to realize this, and so it doesn&#39;t really concentrate on them very
much. They&#39;re always there, but they don&#39;t seem to have much to do with
the movie itself. Rather than horror, the film&#39;s main source of
inspiration seems to be the Road Warrior films, with everyone driving
around in souped up vehicles in the desert. <br /><br />Those who have not seen the original Resident Evil or its sequel,
Resident Evil: Apocalypse, will likely be lost, as the film jumps right
into its story and doesn&#39;t look back. Series heroine Alice (Milla
Jovovich) is still on the run from the evil scientists of the Umbrella
Corporation, who experimented on her and turned her into some kind of
super powered fighting machine. While wandering the deserts, searching
for other survivors, she happens to find a battered old journal that
talks about how there&#39;s an area in Alaska that is unaffected by the
deadly T-Virus that has wiped out half the human race, and turned the
other half into flesh-eating zombies. She joins up with a band of
survivors, which include a couple people who accompanied her on her
last adventure, and some newcomers such as a teenage girl named K-Mart
(Spencer Locke from Monster House), who was given the name because the
people she travels with found her outside of a K-Mart store. When I
heard this, I couldn&#39;t help but think the poor girl is lucky she wasn&#39;t
found outside of a Hooters restaurant. As Alice and her friends search
for enough fuel and supplies for the long journey to Alaska, an evil
scientist at Umbrella named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is secretly tracking
Alice, because he believes she has something in her blood that can stop
the effects of the virus, and wants to use her for his own evil ends.<br /><br />Now that the film franchise is on its third installment, I think it&#39;s
pretty safe to say you already know where you stand on Resident Evil:
Extinction. Those who liked the last two are certain to find something
to like here. The Resident Evil films have always differed from the
games that inspired them, in that they are much more action-heavy in
tone than genuine horror. The zombies themselves are not really the
villains, it is the human scientists of the Umbrella Corporation. The
head of Umbrella is a guy named Albert Wesker (Jason O&#39;Mara), who even
though he sits in a dark underground room behind a desk all day, he
constantly wears sunglasses. This is the kind of movie where we know
everything about the person just by looking at them. If they are
beautiful, rugged, or with a perfectly toned body, they&#39;re the good
guys. If they&#39;re dressed in lab coats or wear black, they&#39;re evil. And
if they&#39;re dirty and unshaven, they&#39;re an extra and most likely
expendable during one of the film&#39;s many action sequences. The movie is
in far too much of a rush to get to where it&#39;s going. It gives us just
enough exposition and plot to get the story out of the way, then dives
head first into a series of action sequences that seem to come one
after another.<br /><br />To be fair, some of the sequences are handled quite well, and with a
surprising amount of expertise. A lengthy sequence where the human
survivors are attacked by hundreds of zombie crows is the closest the
movie ever comes to generating suspense. But far too often, Extinction
is a laundry list of missed opportunities. There is a scene where the
heroes are forced to drive through the ruins of Las Vegas, which is now
submerged under sand. The initial glimpse of the submerged city is
intriguing, and made me excited about what the filmmakers could be
planning with such a unique setting. Unfortunately, all they do is give
us more of everything we&#39;ve already seen. I hate it when a movie teases
me with a fascinating image, then does absolutely nothing with it.
Aside from a character climbing up a replica of the Eifel Tower from
the remains of the Paris-themed hotel/casino, the movie does not use
any of its unique setting to its advantage. The battle may as well have
taken place in a factory or a parking garage for all this movie cares.
The human characters are treated with the same level of indifference.
No one gets to say any dialogue that doesn&#39;t advance the plot in some
way, and relationships between them are hinted at but never really
built on.<br /><br />At its best, Resident Evil: Extinction is total in one ear and out the
other entertainment. It has a couple action scenes that I sort of
admired, but nothing really stood out about it. It doesn&#39;t offer any
thoughts, it doesn&#39;t offend, it&#39;s just there. People who go to the
movies just to get out of the house are sure to have their needs
fulfilled. It manages to kill an hour and a half, and that&#39;s about it.
Anyone looking for something more should probably look elsewhere. Now
that I think about it, people looking for something more probably don&#39;t
go to movies based on video games in the first place.
