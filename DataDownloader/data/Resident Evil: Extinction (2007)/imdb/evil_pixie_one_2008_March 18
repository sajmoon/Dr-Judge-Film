I knew it wasn&#39;t gonna be like the first two when I saw the preview,
but I was set on seeing it anyway. Well, it was disappointing yet
satisfying, if that&#39;s possible. It didn&#39;t disappoint on gore, awesome
zombie kill scenes (the highway/truck kill) and action. They changed
too much stuff that was cool in first and second movies (like the
digital Queen and the box Alice was kept in after the crash). Had some
good lines and scenes, but overall, I didn&#39;t enjoy this as much as the
first two. It&#39;s like Blade Trinity, which was good, but not as a Blade
movie. Extinction: Good as a movie, but NOT as a Resident Evil movie.
I&#39;d watch it again, but there isn&#39;t as much enjoyment in this one.
