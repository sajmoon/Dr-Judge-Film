I think , as a Resident Evil fan , that this movie is really the best
approach to the franchise. The tension in some scenes are really
awesome, the character&#39;s searching rooms, finding clues and things,
shattered rooms with electric cables hanging , sparkling , i mean ,
this is Resident Evil! The action is intense, but not stupidly intense
as in the 2nd movie, it takes place when it has and not all the time.
The constant running for their lives, makes it a really great survival
horror movie. Speaking of characters, i think Alice finally evolved to
something else, she has power , but she doesn&#39;t make an excessive use
of it, she&#39;s not a super-action-Kong-foo fighter 24H/day anymore. I&#39;m a
bit disappointed with Wesker, as a player , i thought he had a
different role, i am mostly mad about the fact that his role has not
been respected, but this is a movie, glad that they didn&#39;t turn him in
a good guy ( Nemesis ??). In order to conclude, the movie could&#39;ve had
a different name, with different character&#39;s , because it isn&#39;t 100%
related to the game, except for the names used in it, but it&#39;s a great
movie, can&#39;t wait for a Collector&#39;s edition DVD!
