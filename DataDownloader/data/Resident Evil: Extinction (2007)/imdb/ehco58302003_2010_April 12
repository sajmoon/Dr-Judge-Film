The series of &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; is the most classic movies among many
which are also adapted from games. Surprised, in every sequel, the
qualities of movie-making are above the average. Every time I watch it,
it always can heavily strike terror into me. I think that the acting of
the characters, the absorbing plot, and the excellent special effects
are surely the causes of it being so popular.<br /><br />In &#x22;Resident Evil: Extinction&#x22;, I find it quite astonishing that Alice
can exert her mental supernatural power. This is totally different from
its original settings. Before it, Alice showed her body strength to
fight against the dead-walking all the way. In this 3rd sequel, Alice
is not only a woman but already a savior of the whole world. It seems
to be something excessively exaggerating to me. I like Alice who defeat
all the dead-walking and save the survivors by her own strength, not
supernatural power. Despite of something I dislike, I, just like a
maniac, still love this movie very much. I really appreciate the
bravery of Alice. Not fearing anything, Alice can survive on her own. I
really wish to become her someday. <br /><br />I have already seen it many times. I enjoy every scene and the
development of the story. After I watch it, I often feel excited and
joyful. As long as you have once seen this movie, I bet you&#x27;ll fall in
love with it unless you don&#x27;t like action sci-fi movie.
