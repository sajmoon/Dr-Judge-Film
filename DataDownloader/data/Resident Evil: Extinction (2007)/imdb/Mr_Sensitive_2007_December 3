And once again I will start by saying I&rsquo;m the big fan of the Resident
Evil franchise both game and the movie, that is until what I saw in
this movie. This is far beyond the most pointless sequel ever and has
almost had nothing to do with anything.<br /><br />Synopsis: Even after the nuclear bomb the city in the previous movie,
the Umbrella Corp still couldn&rsquo;t maintain quarantine, this leads to the
spread of virus throughout the world. Alice and her friends must now
try to survive and help the other in need.<br /><br />The story, the plot, the holes is indescribably bad. There is no plot
just people running around in the desert tried to fight zombie, and
birds. There is no character development or hardly any situation
development from the previous movie except they changed the location.
The story also probably riffs off from many different movies that left
you absolutely no way of finding it out. The story was just plan bad
and there is absolutely nothing to it. Even after they have turned it
into the action movie, the action part itself is rather boring, and out
of the blue the zombie is much more aggressive this time.<br /><br />The new cast member in this movie doesn&rsquo;t add anything in this movie
even one bit. Only Ali Larter character seem to be walking around
organizing this and that (food, petrol, weapon) which most of it
nothing to do with anything but added more screen time to the movie.<br /><br />Lastly: I&rsquo;m tired to writing. This movie is nowhere close to the first
two and probably the most distance from the video game. Everything
about it sucks.<br /><br />Recommendation: Let Just Pretend It Stop With The Second One.<br /><br />Reason To Watch: The name Resident Evil.<br /><br />Reason Not To: Everything about it.<br /><br />Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F).<br /><br />Please Rate Y/N After Read.
