Third entry in the series is a dreary, painfully derivative
horror-thriller set in the midst of a cataclysmic T-virus epidemic that
has plagued most of the known world. With no place to turn and out of
good options, a motley group of survivors must elude flesh-eating
zombies as they make their way across the desolate midwest hoping to
make a new start. Leaden script with a nonexistent plot is redeemed
only partially by Jovovich who&#x27;s in good form as a scrappy,
take-no-prisoners survivor, but beyond that it&#x27;s just a senseless
exercise in violence, special effects, and noise. A perfect addition to
the undiscriminating/no-brainer genre. *&#xBD;
