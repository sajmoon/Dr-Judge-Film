First and foremost: I never played any R.E. game. All I know about the
franchise is what I got from the three movies.<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoyed this adrenaline zombie-splattering
action movie; away goes the annoying Jill Valentine from RE2, away goes
anything resembling the &quot;Nemesis&quot; crap from RE2, while things like the
Red Queen, the laser-beam corridor, the blood hounds return, and a
greater picture of the world is provided. The characters finally have a
little more depth to them, they have their doubts, fears and passions;
civilians finally stop being automatically saint and it turns out that
some are afraid, some are liars and some are wicked.<br /><br />True, automatic guns still have 100+ rounds per clip and ladies still
have perfect makeup and flawless skin even when driving through desert
and smoking 30 cigarettes a day; but this is an action zombie movie
just like Doom-the-Movie or Land-of-the-Dead, and it works well as
such.<br /><br />100 minutes well spent.
