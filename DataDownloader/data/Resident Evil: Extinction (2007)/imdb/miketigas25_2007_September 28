First of all, let me just say that this movie is NOT Resident Evil.
This is a different movie that uses the title &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in order
to attract attention.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the game. Being so, I went through the &quot;pain&quot; of
going through the first two movies with the belief that I can finally
get to see a REAL Resident Evil Character from the game coming into
life. The first Resident Evil was forgivable. It was scary in almost
all aspects and it didn&#39;t really rely much on those &quot;half-a-second&quot;
screams where a zombie (or something else) suddenly pops out into the
darkness and the music quickly gushes in high volume (this was really
exploited poorly in Extinction. Cheap scare practice. Tsk tsk tsk). The
second Resident Evil showed promise. It was &quot;almost&quot; good but the idea
of a horror/thriller movie suddenly shifting into a butt-kicking,
zombie-slashing action film is really disappointing and annoying -
especially the part where &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;The Nemesis&quot; end up doing a fist
fight and The Nemesis technically showing emotion (Poor Nemesis. His
reputation will forever be tarnished).<br /><br />Eventually, there came a third (and hopefully final) installment -
Resident Evil: Extinction. Believe me when I say that the trailer looks
better than the movie. The trailer ignited a &quot;hype&quot;. But the movie
really didn&#39;t deliver much.<br /><br />Besides the traditional &quot;half-a-second&quot; scares, the movie heavily moves
in an eccentric manner: First, the characters say their poor lines.
Second, they then enter a deserted place - a deserted DARK place.
Third, everything seems quiet. Too quiet. Fourth, a &quot;half-a-second&quot;
scare takes place (usually a zombie appearing suddenly, a rat making
some noise, or the wind blowing). Fifth, ACTION! I think this sequence
happened at least three times or more within the movie&#39;s 90-minute
lifespan.<br /><br />As usual, it was Milla Jovovich who saved the movie. Her wide array of
action moves was truly a lot of fun (and knowing for a fact that she
does her own stunts makes it even more fun). Even though the character
Alice never really existed in the games, Milla&#39;s portrayal of the
character made it seem worth it. And I am not talking about the nude
scenes.<br /><br />Poor writing, mediocre script, badly portrayed characters (except
Alice), typical horror/action elements and ultra-obvious (okay, not
that obvious) CGI effects makes this movie a VERY POOR adaptation. I
wonder how the creators of Resident Evil feels.<br /><br />Oh wait. Adaptation? I forgot. This isn&#39;t Resident Evil. This is a
different movie. The last minutes of the film made it clear that it is
different. Being that it is different, I&#39;d recommend to the entire crew
that they should have named it &quot;PROJECT ALICE&quot; instead. Or &quot;DESERT
WORLD&quot;. Or &quot;I am a man who got bitten by a zombie and I won&#39;t tell
anyone so that I can attack the person next to me a few hours later
when I become a zombie&quot;.<br /><br />Watch it or not? You&#39;re choice. If you&#39;re not a fan and have never
played the games (or even read or researched about it), then you won&#39;t
feel a hint of anger and disappointment over the film&#39;s writer and
director. You&#39;ll probably enjoy this - one way or another. BUT if
you&#39;re a fan of the games and are aware of all game&#39;s elements, then do
not even bother with this film. My God. Let&#39;s all just wish that in the
next decade, a TRUE fan of the game will make a movie that will blow
the previous installments into oblivion.
