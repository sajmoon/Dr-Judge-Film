The main thing preventing this movie from being bad is simple; despite
its haunting music and similarities to &#x22;Day of the Dead&#x22;, there&#x27;s
little to nothing intended to be scary. As a horror movie it would&#x27;ve
sucked.<br /><br />Actually there&#x27;s little that was actually noteworthy. The positives
being some character deaths were actually sad &#x26; some things, including
Alice not overly using her newfound telekinetic powers, were actually
explained - and without treating the audience like idiotic people.<br /><br />The negatives included the primary antagonist being stupidly evil, for
example killing his underlings or not trying to rescue them despite
actually needing manpower, and pointless references to the first film
which gave the impression the writers were low on ideas.
