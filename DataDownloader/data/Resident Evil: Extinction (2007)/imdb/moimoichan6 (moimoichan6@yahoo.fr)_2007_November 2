I like &quot;Highlander&quot; and I like Zombies, so I went to see this movie,
even though I didn&#39;t saw the previous ones and ain&#39;t too aware of the
video game (I&#39;ve played once or twice to one of them, but I&#39;m not
fanatic about video-games). In my mind, the movie was a crossover
between sword duels with living dead and cheap visual kitch effects.
Well, I wasn&#39;t disappointed. I&#39;m sure that the desperate high-tech
visual touch of the movie will become kitch in no time (let&#39;s wait ten
years and see how old this movie gets). But what I particularly enjoyed
are the absurd fights robbed in a referential package, that pleased the
B-movie lover in me.<br /><br />&quot;Extinction&quot; is surely not an intellectual movie, not even a
Tarantino-like post modern film, but the way the movie deals with
cinephilic references is quite intriguing. Two examples (but the movie
is full of scenes like that) : there&#39;s an obvious Hitchcock&#39;homage when
infected crows began to attack people as in &quot;The Bird&quot;. And of course,
I especially like the &quot;Day of the dead&quot; parody, that you can see
through the all movie that confronts a mad scientist with stupid
soldiers. Romero&#39;s parody culminates in a hilarious scene, where the
crazy scientist believed he archived to domesticate one of the dead,
but the finally doesn&#39;t seem so ready to be a human slave.<br /><br />The visual aspect of the movie is most intriguing part of the film. I
don&#39;t know about the first ones, but &quot;Resident Evil&quot; manage to be a
gore movie (with blood and rotten living dead), but also tries to be
clean, just like a numeric video game. I think I never saw blood looks
so clean on a movie before, and for that, &quot;Extinction&quot; is quite unique.
It&#39;s like a gore movie made for the all family to watch. To sum up,
there&#39;s funny references, well done action and fight scenes, and a
rather unusual visual style that makes &quot;Resident Evil : Extenction&quot; a
rather funny and pleasant moment.
