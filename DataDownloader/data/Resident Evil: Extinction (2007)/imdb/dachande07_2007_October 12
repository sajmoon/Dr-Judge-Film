While this RE3 was a cracking zombie movie, it strayed to far from the
original concept and excepted storyline. In my opinion this has
rendered the movie pointless in the RE franchise.<br /><br />Let&#39;s not forget that Resident Evil owes it popularity to the game
series, so I think it&#39;s only right that they try and stick to it, even
if it&#39;s just a little bit. It seems very much like the director wanted
to make an updated version of Day of the Dead, if you&#39;ve seen DOTD
you&#39;ll see what I mean in the first 5 minutes of RE3.<br /><br />If this were a stand alone movie I would have given it 10/10, but it
isn&#39;t, they&#39;ve tried to be too creative and the director has tried to
make a different movie. By doing this he&#39;s make a cracking zombie film.
but a Resident Evil film, I think not.<br /><br />I only hope this isn&#39;t the last one, it would be a terrible waste.
