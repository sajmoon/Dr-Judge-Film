2007_October 18 
In spite of having made some competent films(like the overrated
Highlander and the underrated The Shadow),I do not consider Russell
Mulcahy as a great director.He made good works on some solid movies but
we do not have to forget he directed craps like Resurrection or Silent
Trigger.I did not expect too much from Resident Evil:Extinction because
the first two parts from Resident Evil were crap.But I have to say
Resident Evil:Extinction surprised me.It&#x27;s not a great film but it
could keep me fun and I was never bored watching it.I&#x27;m not a fan of
Paul W.S. Anderson(the director from the first Resident Evil and the
screenwriter of the parts 2 and 3)but I have to say that,here,he told a
logic and better story.The story may not be so innovative(some elements
made me remember to the brilliant film Day of the Dead,directed by the
great George A.Romero)but its development is fluid and
consistent.Also,the characters have understandable motives for the
things they do.I also appreciated in Resident Evil:Extinction that the
movie is not afraid of showing gore.The special effects are not perfect
but they have enough style and energy.Maybe,it was because of Mulcahy&#x27;s
good work as a director or for Anderson&#x27;s better screenplay,but
Resident Evil:Extinction is the best film of the trilogy.It&#x27;s not great
or memorable,but the film always kept me fun.
