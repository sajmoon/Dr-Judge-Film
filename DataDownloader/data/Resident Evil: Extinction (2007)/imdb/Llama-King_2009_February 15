2009_February 15 
My expectations for this film were rather high as I stepped into the
theater, simply due to one comment in which Milla Jovovich stated that
she hated the second film in the series (&#39;which is horrible. Alright,
she has my sympathy here....&#39;) but promised that this third installment
would be &quot;rad.&quot; &#39;Alright...she&#39;s probably high, but that didn&#39;t make
the first movie (8/10) that bad....&#39; Let&#39;s start with the positives,
eh? The action, that comsumes nearly the entire movie, is quite
awesome. With wire work that puts the sh*tfest of a movie that the
Matrix to shame, and zombie blood galore, it&#39;s a joy to watch mindless
beasts act as the dummies on which these characters exact their
ass-kicking pleasure. The CG, I have to admit, isn&#39;t as good once you
see it a second time, but still notable. It&#39;s certainly beautiful
visually, with the Mexican landscape scoping about, the the torn
buildings peeking from beneath the sand, though why Vegas is the only
city (when I said Mexican landscape, I meant that it was filmed in
Mexico, not taking place there.) still remaining is...well, I can&#39;t say
anything other than it&#39;s stupid.<br /><br />The camera-work is interesting. Russel Mulcahy&#39;s use constant use of a
moving camera makes for something I haven&#39;t seen too many times, and it
is certainly fun to watch, though I would have preferred Paul
Anderson&#39;s stillness, which would have made the film generally creepier
and more Resident Evil-eque, speaking from a gamer&#39;s perspective.<br /><br />Now to the negative: the whole damn story. The zombie infection spread
past the...city that was nuked...and sterilized...and (because, y&#39;know,
the governmont wouldn&#39;t do anything.) spread to the entire U.S....and
then it spread oversea, &#39;cause viruses can do that, and anybody who
came to another country from the zombie-ridden US wouldn&#39;t be checked
for the virus. And now, 5 years later, the world is turned into a
desert because of it. Not as a result of neglect, the film states the
virus...made the world wither, and die. Right.<br /><br />And the rest of the story, following this, is equally as ridiculous. It
has too many inconsistencies to count--the crows haven&#39;t thought to
feed on infected flesh for HOW long?--and is almost nonextistant.<br /><br />The acting is alright, though far from perfect. The stereotypical
characters really don&#39;t provide any means of displaying talent, nor
does Mulcahy&#39;s insistent approach on making everyone seem &quot;tough.&quot; Ali
Larter, in particular, seems off.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this is an entertaining, extremely fun to watch, and
generally cool-looking...extravaganza of stupidity.<br /><br />I recommend it.
