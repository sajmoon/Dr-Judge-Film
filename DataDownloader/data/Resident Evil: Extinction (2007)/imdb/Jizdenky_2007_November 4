My comment isn&#39;t that different from what I wrote under &#39;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&#39;. Of course the reason why I watch this one is quality time
with family and curiosity regarding the &#39;heroine&#39;s quest&#39;. If this
one&#39;s a hit then there will surely be another sequel.<br /><br />It ain&#39;t that different &#39;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#39; except that this
one has a few more famous actors, it takes place in the desert and it&#39;s
mostly set during daytime. Our &#39;heroine&#39;, next to being a Tomb Raider
hotty, also acquires some X-men superpowers. She&#39;s fighting zombies
again but this time she&#39;s accompanied by the talented Ali Larter and
the non-talented Ashanti among a few others. You alos get to see a lot
of blood and gore which is (un?)intentionally presented in a comic way.<br /><br />This time the zombies are a result of bad makeup as they look a lot
tackier than before. The background score is very similar to that of
&#39;Resident Evil&#39;. Also the director tries to pull a little bit of Alfred
Hitchcock&#39;s &#39;Birds&#39;. There are several laugh out loud moments (which
certainly wasn&#39;t the director&#39;s intention).<br /><br />Jovovich&#39;s acting is alright. She does look very beautiful in deglam.
The rest of the actors don&#39;t have anything to do. Even the talented Ali
Larter is wasted (but maybe there&#39;s something for her in part 4).<br /><br />This film has absolutely nothing new to offer as it&#39;s full of clich&eacute;s
and predictability. It seems to be leaning more towards one of those
mindless forgettable summer blockbusters. Forgettable entertainment.
