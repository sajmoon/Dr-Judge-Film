I just saw the second and third movies. And i must say that they have
been better than the previous ones. First one was prolly the scariest
one of the three, but i don&#39;t like scary movies. I&#39;m more into fun
mayhem, with dismembered body parts flying everywhere. And the 2
sequels have been just that! :D<br /><br />Anyway, if you liked the second one you&#39;ll love this one. And if you
haven&#39;t seen the previous movies, do not watch this one until you have
seen them, okay? Still not 10 lines.. umm, okay, One thing that i love
about Resident Evil movies are their endings, like every one of them
has had a super cool ending and this third one was no exception! Oh I
wish they made a fourth one already!
