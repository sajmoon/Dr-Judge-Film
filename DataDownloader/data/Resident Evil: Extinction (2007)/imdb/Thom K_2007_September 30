OK So im a big resident evil fan, love the games, the first movie was
sooooo amazing and the 2nd one was OK. So I was super excited for this
film, bought a shirt with it on there and everything, I go to the
movie, and the beginning Is super good, but then there was no plot
through the whole movie, seriously i was laughing throughout the movie.
I was so disappointed. You know a movie will bomb when Ashanti gets
involved, thats just like busta rhymes in a halloween part 50 comes out
to try and make the movie good. It just doesn&#39;t happen. The graphics
were sooooo bad. When alice cuts straight up through a zombie then
waits a second, he moves but the slit stays in the same place, its like
a crappy sci-fi original film movie. I was so disappointed. This movie
had such a high potential to be amazing, but definitely was one of the
worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen, worse movie in the whole genre. and
*SPOILER* when you see the tyrant which is dr.issac&#39;s that was just
ridiculous, the tyrant cant talk, and he was using the cheesiest
dialogue ever. Ill admit that their was one really good part when she
talks to the program queen thing in the new hive, when shes like &quot;your
sisters a bitch&quot; cuz that made it great, but other then that the movie
was dull. <br /><br />Sorry if this ruins you wanting to see the movie, but i just don&#39;t want
people to be disappointed, just stick with the first 2, you&#39;ll be happy
and just think it ends there.
