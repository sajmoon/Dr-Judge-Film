&quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; is one of the more enjoyable entries in the
genre.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />With the world a barren wasteland, Alice, (Milla Jovovich) one of the
few survivors of the T-virus, manages to stay on the run from the
hordes of undead still alive. Also on the run, Claire Redfield, (Ali
Larter) and a band of survivors, Carlos Olivera, (Oded Fehr) L.J.,
(Mike Epps) Betty, (Ashanti) Mikey, (Christopher Egan) K-Mart, (Spencer
Locke) Chase, (Linden Ashby) and Otto, (Joe Hursley) manage to find
shelter in an old motel, and after she saves them from an attack, she
joins them on their quest to find shelter in the world. With Dr.
Isaacs, (Iain Glen) from Umbrella Corp after them for her ability to
help out a project that could save mankind, she tries to help her
friends survive the relentless attacks of the undead.<br /><br />The Good News: There was a lot to like about this one. One of the
better features is that there&#39;s a lot of action scenes in here, which
are always quite enjoyable in here. There&#39;s some good ones in here,
from the nice opening in the trapped radio station which soon turns
into a fantastic sequence of her trying to outwit turned zombie-dogs
inside a pit complete with the requisite amount of close-calls and
traps to be avoided as well as out-maneuvering the dogs using the
surroundings before letting them go loose on the spectators, to a
longer sequence later at a gas station which is a lot of fun. The big
ones, though, are three key centerpiece sequences that serve as the
best examples of the action in here. The first one is a sequence where
zombified ravens swarm their camp-out, which leads to several big
moments including a great starting sequence with the flock flying down
and just viciously taking it to the buses, resulting in a tense,
action-packed scene and a lot of great moments and a spectacular way to
end it. The biggest, and longest, scene here is the attack at Las
Vegas, where there&#39;s just a humongous horde of zombies coming through
the barriers and attacking everything in sight, which is always fun.
The methods of the counter-attack against the zombies are unique and
well-executed, allowing for tons of thrilling encounters within and are
played off rather well. That there&#39;s a lot of big, graphic deaths and
big action effects is a big plus. It&#39;s fun and exciting and definitely
worthwhile as one of the best scenes in the film. The other big one is
the final battle against the mutant, which manages to go from a lab
through a basement, out into the model of the house and finally ends
during the simulation run for one of the tests, features a lot of big
moments and comes off with a satisfying finish. The film&#39;s also really
gory at times, with some really messy moments. There&#39;s a slew of
slicing and decapitations, gunshots galore, a couple completely
dismembered corpses that are completely torn up, bites on almost
everything, a brutal impaling with tentacles and much, much more,
leaving this one feeling really bloody and graphic. The last plus is
the really nice-looking zombies, which look really nice, and good
enough to be considered acceptable. It&#39;s nice and does what it needs
to. These here are what make the film enjoyable.<br /><br />The Bad News: There wasn&#39;t too many problems at all with this one. One
of the biggest problems is that, like all the other ones in the series,
nothing is either explained or is held off on an explanation until the
end. The psychic powers and telekinesis issues are completely
unexplained, never having been used in the first two films and are put
on display here quite frequently, making their origin a bit of a
mystery. Others, such as the real reasoning behind the company&#39;s chase
of her, is a one sentence blurb given ten minutes before the finale and
it leaves the whole thing to a big question mark as to what&#39;s
happening. There&#39;s plenty more examples, but this is a staple of the
series and really shouldn&#39;t count here. The only other flaw is the
film&#39;s rather low-key opening, which seems like an odd rehash of the
original events in the series and doesn&#39;t really make sense. These are
all that&#39;s really wrong with this one.<br /><br />The Final Verdict: A lot more fun than it really should&#39;ve been, with
some nice good points thrown in as well to offer up some big pluses.
Worthwhile for fans of the movie series or those who prefer the more
adrenaline-laced zombie movies, while those who haven&#39;t enjoyed the
series or prefer the video games should heed caution.<br /><br />Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language
