After watching Resident evil Extinction, I was quite satisfied at all
of the action scenes that were included in this movie. The actors in
the movie did a reasonable job, however, knowing what the resident evil
movies compared to the game didn&#39;t exactly match at all, I was still
thrilled to see the guns blasting, neck chopping, and crow burning
action.<br /><br />I was so glad it wasn&#39;t a let down like Apocalypse was, but it still
had some flaws like any other movie. I did not like how they made Alice
at all. This is suppose to be survival horror! Giving someone special
abilities lowers the chance of tension. Example, if you were in a
zombie outbreak but had the ability of quick reflexes, mind powers to
blow up brains, telepathic, and so on. You wouldn&#39;t be as scared as a
lone survivor with nothing but his own wits to survive. I&#39;d give it 6.7
out of 10
