With Extinction, the Resident Evil franchise perhaps have made its mark
as the most enduring computer game turned movie to date. Most of such
movies usually make for cheesy lazy weekend entertainment, little in
depth but filled with plenty of set action pieces, which for the most
parts are nothing groundbreaking. But what this franchise has to credit
for its longevity, is Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />OK, so she has made mostly mediocre movies of late (I sense some
fanboys will get me for this, but let me put it straight, I&#39;m a fan of
hers too), especially with the lacklustre Ultraviolet, and the really
showy .45. If not best remembered for her role as Leeloo in Luc
Besson&#39;s The Fifth Element (still credited in my books as the ONLY film
I watched with having zero prior knowledge on anything about it), then
it&#39;ll be for her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking superbeing
whose blood holds the key to a reversal of the effects of the T-virus
engineered by the evil Umbrella Corporation.<br /><br />The premise here is similar to that of 28 Days/Weeks Later, where the
virus is now out of control, and mutates humans into flesh chomping
zombies, spreading mayhem worldwide. Human survivors are few and far
between, and where we left off from Apocalypse, Alice is now travelling
the world alone, seeking refuge and peace, while evading Umbrella&#39;s
gunsights. It presumably takes place a significant amount of time after
the predecessor, given that Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) doesn&#39;t
return for this, keeping the doors open for either an unlikely spin
off, or a revisit into the gap in timeline should Guillory sign on the
dotted line.<br /><br />But I guess as Juvovich fans, we don&#39;t really care, do we? So long as
we get to see our heroine in action, we&#39;re satisfied, whether she&#39;s
causing misery to her opponents from her twin handguns, double Kukri
knives or just her incredibly toned limbs, we&#39;re rooting for her all
the way, dressed in garb personally designed by Juvovich herself, which
provides for both form and functionality. The trend of casting pretty
women to pair with her continues, with the first movie having Michelle
Rodriguez, the second with Guillory, and now, Heroes&#39; Ali Larter and
Spencer Locke join the fray. However, they are relegated to more
pedestrian roles as compared to previous partners, so don&#39;t be
expecting much from them, especially for fans of Larter.<br /><br />The story can be no more simpler than Alice serving as a messiah for a
small convoy of survivors headed by Larter&#39;s Claire, delivering them a
message to journey to the promised land in Alaska. But of course the
road to Peace and No Infection is plagued by challenges which
culminates in a big battle in Las Vegas, where the trailers have teased
with the entire city being semi-buried in sand. And like a video game,
all levels will lead to their respective Big Boss to do battle with,
and Extinction doesn&#39;t evade that formula too. Watching Alice grow in
power, provides a lot of kick in some of the cool things she can do,
enhanced with special effects of course.<br /><br />Don&#39;t expect the franchise to slam the door of opportunity shut on
itself. By the look of things, we might even see a fourth movie coming
up in perhaps two or three years time (the interval between the movies
thus far). Expect plenty of blood and gore as our heroes cut through
ugly zombies like hot knife through butter, and none other does it more
balletic and graceful than Milla Juvovich. You go, girl!
