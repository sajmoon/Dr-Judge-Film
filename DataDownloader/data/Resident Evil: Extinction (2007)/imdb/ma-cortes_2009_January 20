The deadly virus has decimated the world, exception a little zone in
Alaska where live people no-infected . Years later , one time Racoon
was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by ambitious Dr.
Isaacs(Iain Glen) continues his weird experiments with the deadly
T-virus. But the Zombies spread the epidemic and those exposed to cruel
bite suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos.
Alice(Milla Jovovich)is attempting to survive , and she finds new
survivors(Ali Larter, Ashanti along with Oded Fehr and Mike Epps who
repeat characters) traveling throughout Nevada desert . They must
confront carnivorous crows, hordes of zombies starving of human flesh
and an evil corporation chief who creates the most horrifying creatures
ever made .The survivor group are surrounded , facing the world
destruction by deadly epidemic.<br /><br />This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, action-filled with
fierce combats and lots of gore and guts.The horror and action moments
are fast moving and compactly realized. The film turns out to be a
crossover between &#x27;the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2&#x27;, the &#x27;George A
Romero&#x27;s Zombies&#x27; and genetic experiments from &#x27;Sigourney Wever-Ripley
in Alien saga &#x27;. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as
&#x27;Resident evil&#x27;(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer and
screenwriter) and &#x27;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x27;(2004,Alexander
Witt)resulting to be a nice following. The creepy images of wide range
from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and
amazing frames. It&#x27;s predictable but we have seen the previous chapters
but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic
acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The
flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams,
shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create a truly horrible
zombie cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic
events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the creepy scenarios
in Las Vegas without people, totally uninhabited and covered of sand.
Cool,luminous cinematography using steadicam by David Johnson and
haunting musical score by Charles Clouser.The motion picture is
surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Russell
Mulcahy(Razorback,Highlander, Resurrection).
