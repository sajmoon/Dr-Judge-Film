As far as this genre goes, Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) earns a
straight 10 in my book. Milla Jovavich is back, and her on-screen
heroism personified as Alice was turning corners, thwarting sadistic
adversaries, and packed a punch like you couldn&#39;t believe. She plays
the part brilliantly, and I am glad I watched it. If you enjoyed the
previous two movies, just let me say, this one won&#39;t let you down. I
found myself actually trying to keep myself from jumping a few times,
as the suspense continued. Yes, in my opinion, this franchise stayed
true to excellence, the story continues to progress, and quite
interestingly it left me hoping yet for the next part of the story.
Great job, cast and crew.
