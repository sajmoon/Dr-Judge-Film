I don&#x27;t know whose&#x27;s decision it was to change a lot about these films.
But in my opinion. I know they should have stopped throwing in
characters in the movie. That were not in the original games! I mean.
The title of the films are &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22;. They ARE supposed to be
based on the game series &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22;. And when people go to the
cinemas to see &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; they expect to see the game, transformed
to a motion picture. I mean the first was a great film. But for the
hardcore RES fans. There was no original RES characters! why call the
RESIDENT EVIL if your only going to have the MANSION, UMBRELLA, A FEW
ZOMBIES, A LICKER AND THE T VIRUS. That have anything to do with the
game. I&#x27;m an amateur Movie Director. And since I was young, I planned
on re-making the RES games to movies. Changing only minuscule details,
and staying true to the games. People who watch the RES movies, who
have never played the games will know no different. But I can guarantee
if they had stayed true to the games. It would have been more
entertaining, more action, better characters, and grossed more money.
With more followers.
