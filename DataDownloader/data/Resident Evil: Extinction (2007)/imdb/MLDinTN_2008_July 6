I was quite impressed with this movie since it was the third sequel. It
is still actually entertaining and good and the plot moves forward. One
negative for me was the ending. It&#39;s set up for the next film with
several hundred Alice&#39;s ready to kick Umbrella&#39;s arse. In this movie,
it has been years since the T virus infected Raccoon City and it has
spread wiping out the population and turning the land into a desert.
Alice is traveling by herself avoiding Umbrella&#39;s spies. We also find
out that Alice has mental powers now. Due to no transportation, she
must join up with a caravan and convinces them that they should try to
go to Alaska, where infection may not have spread yet. Only problem is
they must look for fuel in Vegas.<br /><br />During this time Umbrella has tracked Alice and has a surprise waiting
in Vegas. But the evil scientist gets bit in Vegas and injects lots of
antivirus and the effects turn out pretty devastating. Alice decides
they must get Umbrella&#39;s helicopter to get to Alaska and comes up with
a plan. The remaining survivors get on the copter while Alice goes
underground to take care of Umbrella.<br /><br />One problem I had was how could the zombies climb Eifel Tower yet
thousands of them couldn&#39;t climb or knock down a wire fence. Also, when
alice busts the fence down, she takes her sweet time in going down
below. How come the zombies aren&#39;t running after her since the fence
has a hole in it.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty good and the plot was interesting. It
just wasn&#39;t a repeat of the previous films. And I liked the opening
when I&#39;m like isn&#39;t this the first film? And the way the mutant
scientist dies after bragging I can&#39;t be killed was good.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first two, you will want to see this
one. And with the ending, they have to make a fourth film.
