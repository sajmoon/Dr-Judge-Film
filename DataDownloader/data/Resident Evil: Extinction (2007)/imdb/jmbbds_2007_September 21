2007_September 21 
My husband and I actually watched the first two movies again this week
in preparation to see this movie opening night. Today before we went to
see the movie we saw it was not rated and worried. Then we saw it was
being bad mouthed by places like E! Online. They were so wrong. It was
great. I do not play video games at all, so was not a fan of the game
before the movie. I also think this was just as good as the first two.
People in the audience including me applauded at the end. The suspense
had me squeezing my husband&#39;s hands and jumping frequently. I like the
continuity, having her meet up with two of the people from the second
movie and I liked the strong women figures. I can&#39;t wait for the fourth
movie...........
