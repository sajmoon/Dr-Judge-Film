This film was surprisingly watchable and I rate it the best in the
Resident Evil series. The film carries on from where &#39;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&#39; stopped. The action is better staged and the VFX much
better than the previous two films. There are some genuine scares and
there&#39;s a chilling scene that works well as a homage to Hitchcock&#39;s
&#39;The Birds&#39;. Milla Jovovich has very few lines as always, but carries
the film with her presence. The story is needlessly complicated and the
climactic action sequences a letdown. Still watchable at least on
television/DVD.<br /><br />Overall 6/10
