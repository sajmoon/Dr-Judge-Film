This was a surprisingly good movie. Definitely the best one out of the
three made. I think this film is somewhat under appreciated and under
rated. In fact, the more I think about this movie the more I want to
see it again, its that kind of movie.<br /><br />It had scary parts along with well done action sequences. Milla
Jovovich was really good in it, you can tell she was in great shape for
the movie. It was an entertaining movie to watch throughout and never
got boring.<br /><br />Nice cinematography in the filming of the desert, and a world that was
devastated in the future was presented in a believable way. The evil
villain was played well by the actor and was memorable. The story moved
at a good pace and made sense in the &#x22;universe&#x22; the movie created. Some
good performances by other actors also, the acting all around was
better than expected. <br /><br />This is a movie I would consider buying and I don&#x27;t think that of many
movies.
