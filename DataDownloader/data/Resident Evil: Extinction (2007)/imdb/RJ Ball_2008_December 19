I don&#39;t understand how so many people don&#39;t like this movie! I watched
it and felt it was an incredible movie, with a good story and really
awesome action! What&#39;s so wrong with it? I came on here expecting to
see it have at least an 8, but for some reason everybody is giving it
terrible ratings..This is my first comment/review I have given on this
website, and it&#39;s only because I am standing up for Resident Evil
Extinction and that it&#39;s actually good. I think a lot of people will be
missing out on a great movie if they choose to listen to the bad
reviews given by the geeks on this site who hate all three of the
movies.. Anyways, go watch it, it&#39;s really good, you&#39;ll like it, it&#39;s
fun and full of action, plus gets pretty freaky at some parts!
