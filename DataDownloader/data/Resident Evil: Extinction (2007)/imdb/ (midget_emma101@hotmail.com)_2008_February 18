A big improvement over Apocalypse. Another Resident Evil movie has hit
the world and just like the first two it is average. It is more of the
same with little changes. Maybe it is time for the Resident Evil movies
to have a big makeover or become extinct.<br /><br />This time we are in the desert and like last time we are following some
survivors. Same story basically. They have just added a new zombie,
gave Alice new powers and put us in the desert. This doesn&#39;t get past
much people. I am talking to you Resident evil writers. It feels like
someone sat there and said &quot; It would look cool if we done that&quot;.<br /><br />Some things that really annoy me is the zombies. We see them ripping
cars apart but they can&#39;t push down an everyday fence. Another thing
they pay way to much attention to Alice. Whether your watching her
spinning swords around or watching her jump slow motion through the
air. It is a waste of time and this movie only goes for an hour and
half already.<br /><br />There are some good things. There are some eye catching environments
and 1 or 2 jump scares but thats it. It seems the series can&#39;t catch up
with the good zombie movies. An average movie.<br /><br />Only see this if you have seen the first two.<br /><br />6/10
