I confess..I am drawn to B movies like moths to a flame! Despite having
missed out on the earlier 2 films of the trilogy, I rented this on a
lazy evening and got pretty much what I expected - bonus being some
sheer eye candy in the form of the gorgeous Ali Larter and the equally
lovely Milla Jovovich! The movie is a pretty straight forward zombies
vs humans clash and not many surprises are in store. The familiar boo
moments and obligatory gory killings compliment the action set-pieces,
at least 2 of which (a vicious crow-attack &amp; an expansive shootout set
in a desolate, devastated Las Vegas of the future) are quite
impressive. The plot, if you can find one, is a mere excuse to deflect
any criticism that might come one&#39;s way for having the gall in listing
a director/screenwriter for the film and not just an action
choreographer! Watch it if you&#39;re in the mood to satiate a craving for
blood, gore &amp; guts - not if you seek food for thought...
