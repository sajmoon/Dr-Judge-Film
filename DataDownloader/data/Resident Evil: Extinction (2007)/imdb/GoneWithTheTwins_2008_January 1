Ridiculous, nonsensical and grossly unnecessary, Resident Evil:
Extinction is quite possibly the most contemptible film so far this
year. Lacking any faithfulness to the original video game franchise, as
well as failing to expand upon the already pointless plotting of the
first two films, this rehashed mishmash of utter idiocy is a giant leap
in the wrong direction for film-making. The saddest part of this whole
ludicrous ordeal is that despite what critics will inevitably say about
Resident Evil: Extinction, the fans who actually expect something out
of this farce will be even more disappointed.<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich) rejoins a group of weathered survivors of the
T-Virus zombie invasion of the world, which has led to the
near-complete annihilation of humankind. Teaming with Claire Redfield
(Ali Larter) to help plan an escape from the barren deserts of Nevada,
Alice must also uncover the plot behind her mysterious cloning and the
key to stopping the zombie outbreak for good.<br /><br />Starting with all-too familiar scenes from the first film which doesn&#39;t
serve as a recap but begs the audience to question whether this is
actually a new movie or not, the purportedly final chapter in the
Resident Evil film trilogy lunges down the racetrack with an awkward
stumble. Instantly milking each scene for as many cheap scares and
sudden loud noises that it can muster, the camera mimics the style of
the video game, tiptoeing down corridors and hallways, and peering
through bloodied doors. The detail oriented sets and wonderfully
ghastly locations and props are perhaps the only noteworthy aspect of
the film. It&#39;s a shame that as make-up and creature effects get better,
the story and acting get exponentially worse.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is a total badass &#150; thanks to the editing which is
careful to make sure the audience is completely disoriented and unable
to focus on any of the stunts or martial arts moves in any of the fight
sequences. Mutilated dogs, long-awaited zombie crows, and frenzied
super-aggressive zombie mutations are all a blur as Alice dances about
in mid-air and in slow-motion, a la The Matrix. While a few of the
zombie encounters demonstrate decent shotgun-to-the-head,
close-encounter originality, the majority of the gunplay and wire-fu
stunts are hokey and downright laughable. Which perfectly matches the
acting, replete with clich&eacute; lines, bland characters, expected deaths
and moronic sacrifices.<br /><br />For all the time the film takes to develop its paper-thin characters,
it shovels them out into clamoring blood-hungry zombie hordes to be
made quick work of. Several of the character names match those from the
video games, but you won&#39;t find an ounce of authenticity to any of
their performances, physical appearance or backgrounds. Which, again,
makes it all that more appropriate that so many victims are thrown into
the wake of the living dead.<br /><br />Alice gains a bit of telekinetic superpowers (I don&#39;t recall that in
the video games), the world becomes a desolate post-apocalyptic desert
wasteland (I don&#39;t recall that in the video games) and Alaska may be
the last hope for uncontaminated survivors (that has to be in the video
games). Umbrella Corporation still runs everything, mercilessly
experiments with the T-Virus, and employs psychotic scientists who are
destined to become more powerful, evil and mutated than the zombies. At
least the humans are more prominent villains than the bumbling undead.
I would hate to think what would happen if the audience was actually
frightened by flesh-eating, blood-starved, maniacally-crazed,
decomposing zombies.<br /><br />- Mike Massie
