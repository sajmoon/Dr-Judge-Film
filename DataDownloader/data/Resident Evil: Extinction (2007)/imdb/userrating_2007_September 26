2007_September 26 
Firstly, I was pretty sure what I was walking into with this film. At
the worst, I expected a sub par action/zombie flick, and that&#39;s exactly
what you get. Well, almost that good, but not quite.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead?<br /><br />This was a text book example of just how unoriginal the Hollywood
horror genre has become. Not only that, this film actually flaunts that
fact. It basically plunders most of George Romer&#39;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;
(1985) for ideas, sets and story lines, and even finds time to rip an
action sequence directly from the &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004) remake.
Fusing all that with the blatant &quot;Max Max&quot; approach does not make it
original, fellas. Not content with those two obvious rips, the
&quot;filmmakers&quot; do their worst to nip a bit from &quot;The Birds&quot; for a
laughable sequence, nick their final monster design from &quot;From Beyond&quot;
and &quot;The Swamp Thing&quot; and kill him off with a method right out of &quot;The
Cube.&quot; Have I missed anything? I&#39;m sure the filmmakers would use the
word &quot;homage&quot; to no end, but those who don&#39;t buy into the Hollywood
copy machine would use the word &quot;insult&quot; instead.<br /><br />I only have two questions. A) Who green lights this crap? B) How much
of the effects budget went to digitally smooth Milla&#39;s skin on all her
close-ups (it looked ridiculous).<br /><br />Milla did a decent job and the costume design was nice, so a generous 3
out of 10 for me.
