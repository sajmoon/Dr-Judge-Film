This actually is an average zombie/horror movie but what makes it more
interesting is that it has action-packed scenes which are great. I am
not saying that this movie is not good but it is just the old trick,
the same usual zombie movie. Zombie movies always feature hot women
running and gore plus the usual type of story line. Resident Evil is
based on the game which I never play. It is one of the few good game
adapted although I did not play the game but the story line seems
pretty interesting. Let&#39;s recount some of the previous movies that are
adapted from the games. DOA is one of them and it is fairly okay.
Bloodrayne is another and the two movies are trash. This is what I can
recall. Let&#39;s head back to Resident Evil 3. <br /><br />Some of the pointers:<br /><br />Hot women: Check! It has number of hot women. Milla Jovovich did a
pretty good job in carrying out Alice&#39;s role. Ali Larter (from the TV
show, Heroes) also did a good job in portraying her character Claire.
You get to see them fighting or shooting. Brave women.<br /><br />Gore: Check! That is the main target of almost all horror and zombie
movies.It has quite a lot of gore and blood considering. It is more
bloodier than Resident Evil 2. You get to see the usual gore like
zombie biting people and others. It did a good job just not only for
gore but the action stunts. That makes it not like most of the zombie
movies. It has both the gore and the intense action.<br /><br />Storyline: It is better than Resident Evil 2. It has the simple story
line to keep up. The story is Alice resurfaces to protect convoy of the
uninfected towards refuge in Alaska. Simple and short. Along the way,
you get to see Alice cutting zombies, doing high kicks and others.<br /><br />Overall, it does make a good harmless movie to watch during the
weekends. It may not be the best game adapted but it certainly got the
guts. You like both action and horror movies, this is for you.
