Everyone was excited to see how well the third installment of Paul W.S.
Anderson&#39;s (writer) Resident Evil will flaunt in theater&#39;s. I was as
well anticipating seeing the movie in theater&#39;s as usual but decided to
wait for it at original copies or clear, legal ripped movie on the net.
Finally watching the film, I wasn&#39;t at all intensified with the flicks
and twists it presented me for the first thirty minutes. Disappointing,
to partially express a view for this, the third installment of Resident
Evil wasn&#39;t that eye-catching, I guess the plot and acting didn&#39;t fit
in, the story was quite lame to convince real scenery of an almost
extinct post-apocalyptic world. The action scenes were also not that
creative, but least to say so Milla Jovovich manage to preserve her
character as is&#133;the only gruesome I could acceptably identify were
four: zombies ,dead K9s, infected crows and oh the sudden mutation of
Dr. Isaac whom he consider himself the future he was always seeking
rather than Alice herself. I also felt pity for those untimely
sacrifices some characters gone, except for Carlos Olivera&#151;and I knew
that he and Alice had &quot;something&quot;, I was glad but unsatisfied.<br /><br />Least to say so, it was still a considerable Resident Evil film sequel
to follow what happened thereafter and apocalyptic disaster. But for me
I appreciate the first two installments as more compelling. In this
movie, I didn&#39;t felt the chills I usually had with the first two ones.
