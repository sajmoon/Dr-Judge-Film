I have never cared much about zombie-movies, because virtually every
single one of them is utterly boring and as such a total waste of
money. These mindless pictures always feature a world of undead
creatures, one even uglier than the next, feasting on human flesh and
leaving a small army of one-dimensional characters to fight for their
lives and the survival of the human race. Mostly: these pitiful movies
don&#39;t have a happy end and they never contain anything more than a lot
of shooting and even more people dying in the most horrifying way. But
every now and then: there is a zombie-movie worth watching. Usually
director George A. Romero knows how to make a pretty good zombie-movie,
but then again: he did in fact invent this subgenre. My favorite
zombie-movie to date remains the 2004-remake &quot;Dawn of the dead&quot;. This
film does indeed have great actors in a pretty plausible plot.<br /><br />Whilst the first &quot;Resident evil&quot; was a pretty good movie and the second
one weak but not terrible, this third instalment manages to ruin it
all. It is not good at all! The acting is feeble and its characters are
as dull as the stupid script in which they appear. Even the main
character Alice became astonishingly dreary and ends up looking like a
cheap version of Tomb Raider cyberbabe Lara Croft (whom is far more
interesting; by the way).<br /><br />The only spectacular scene is a shameful copy of the classic
Hitchcock-film &quot;The Birds&quot; and even though they use a lot more birds
here, there is still a serious lack of intensity that the 1963-thriller
continuously possessed. The big monster at the end is fake and
ridiculous-looking and thus nowhere near as frightening as the ones of
the first and second movie. It confirms the fact that nearly everything
about this horror-movie is one complete failure.<br /><br />In short: Making movies out of videogames is always a bit of a risk,
unless you know exactly what you&#39;re doing. The people behind this movie
never had a clue and that results in an inevitably brainless picture.
