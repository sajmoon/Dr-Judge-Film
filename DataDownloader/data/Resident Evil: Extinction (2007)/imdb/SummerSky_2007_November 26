This is the worst movie I have seen this year. Character development is
totally neglected, the plot lacks any twists and could be written by a
12-year-old monkey.<br /><br />This production crew even didn&#39;t shun to use totally stereotypical
B-movie props like *rolling tumbleweeds* in the desert hahaha! You just
can imagine the fans blowing just outside the viewing area...and this
was in the opening scene, I still had to sit through the whole movie :(
When I got home from seeing this movie, I was so bored that I just
checked out a few YouToube videos on my laptop that figured crashing RC
airplanes - Yes, it&#39;s that bad...
