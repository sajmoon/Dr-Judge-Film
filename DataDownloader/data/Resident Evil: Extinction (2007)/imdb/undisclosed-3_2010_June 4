Seriously, this movie is so bad, I can&#x27;t understand why some people
rated it so high. I liked the first part really much, the second one
was crap, but this is really bad...<br /><br />1. The whole story does not make any sense. It&#x27;s just a brainless
sequence of dumb action scenes 2. The dialogs are dumber than dumb 3.
The acting is really poor 4. The movie is way too far away from the
original Resident Evil story 5. The CGI done at closeups to Millas face
are ridiculous, bad and senseless<br /><br />I thank god, that Paul W.S. Anderson will direct the 4th part again by
himself.<br /><br />Mulcahy: you are not able to direct a movie - go back to music videos
