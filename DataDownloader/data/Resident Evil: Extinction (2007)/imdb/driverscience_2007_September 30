Being a male, I might be slightly prejudiced as Milla Jovovich
definitely is entertaining to watch even on her own. But here goes my
review: From beginning to end, this movie just really makes it as a
hypnotically entertaining science fiction suspense/action film.
Directing, acting, special effects, plot, all came together into a well
executed cinematic creation. I was glued to the screen and even jumping
out of my seat as surprises awaited every turn. I found no dull moments
as each scene was entertaining in its own way. I would give this a
higher rating, but found myself holding back because I generally do not
like this genre of film. 8 would then be my highest rating for this
genre. Glad I was talked into seeing it and would even sit through it
again with pleasure.
