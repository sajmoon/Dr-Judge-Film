Resident Evil: Extinction is just an extremely fun flick. Don&#39;t sit
there trying to find some underlying plot or deeper meaning because
there isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s a fun, shoot &#39;em up, zombie flick with Milla
Jovovich doing back flips and killing zombies. So do yourself a favor
and leave your brain at the door and sit back and relax. It&#39;s a nice,
worthy addition to the franchise that&#39;s about as good as the first one
and will keep you entertained from beginning to end.<br /><br />The plot is almost nonexistent, but who cares? It&#39;s a zombie movie.
Just go in expecting a good time and you&#39;ll be satisfied. It&#39;s more of
a focus on super-cool action and zombie slaying than it is on plot.
It&#39;s just an action packed movie complete with flesh eating zombies and
acts like a summer blockbuster (even though it was released in
September), which makes it one hell of an entertaining film.<br /><br />So basically, here&#39;s what it is about. It has been about 5 years or so
since the zombies have overtaken the world due to the Umbrella
Corporation&#39;s evilness. The world has turned into a desert (don&#39;t ask
me, I don&#39;t know why even though it tries to explain towards the
beginning). Now, people are starting to give up and lose hope so they
start to not really care about surviving. Alice (Milla Jovovich)
reunites with a few of the characters of previous films) and it dawns
on them that they should go to Alaska because there aren&#39;t any zombies
there. Go Alaska! However, the Umbrella corporation is trying to
capture Alice to make clones of her so they can use her super awesome
kung fu moves for a cure to zombies. They plan to go about this by
killing her and getting her blood. So the action happens and numerous
action scenes and zombie bites later, a film is complete. The movie
expects you to have seen the previous two films for the most part, but
it doesn&#39;t entirely leave people who have never seen the first two in
the dark.<br /><br />The acting, which isn&#39;t really essential to the movie for most
characters, is pretty good. Milla Jovovich plays her usual badass
persona and certainly looks like she had a good time with it. Ali
Larter, while not her best performance, does a pretty good job. She
plays the leader of a large group of traveling survivors. Oded Fehr
returns, and even though I&#39;ve never really cared for his character nor
did I ever find him memorable, he does an adequate job in reprising his
role. Iain Glen has been a great villain in the two Resident Evil films
he was in, including this one, where his role is expanded a bit.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, and it is probably on par with the
original. I would definitely recommend it to people looking for a fun,
action packed movie. It will definitely please fans of the series.<br /><br />8/10
