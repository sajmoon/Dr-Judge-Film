Oh yes, I enjoyed &#x22;Resident Evil: Extinction&#x22; quite a bit. I liked the
first one, nothing wrong with it really. I was a little bit
disappointed with how the second one turned out, on some levels. But
this third one really felt to me like it put the whole concept and
storyline back on the rails again. As far as that goes, the
post-apocalyptic setting - and me being a sucker for it - had even
little to do with it. But in general, yes, it did grab a hold of me.
For such a setting, it totally had the right look &#x26; feel, just like it
should. The zombie crows were undeniably cool, whether you liked them
or not. A bit sad they only had them featured in one action scene. What
I did like about the previous film, was the hint at the ending
regarding Milla&#x27;s character developing telekinetic abilities. I was
really satisfied to see a bit more of them in this film. I&#x27;m granting
&#x22;Extinction&#x22; a whole extra point for the sole reason it managed to
entertain me the most out of all three films so far. Unexpectedly, this
turned out my favorite so far. Not bad, for a third film. And for once,
I don&#x27;t mind seeing a horror franchise go on, as I have some hopes now
for 2010&#x27;s &#x22;Afterlife&#x22; installment. And I fear the day they&#x27;ll write
Milla Jovovich out of the series. I hope they&#x27;ll call it quits before
that ever happens.
