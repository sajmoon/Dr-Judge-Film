Resident Evil Extinction is the third installment of the franchise
which originated from the game. I sincerely loved this movie. AWESOME.
The action was great. The stunts were superb and I thought the acting
was good. I was kept at the edge of my seat when I was watching this
movie. There were parts which made me jump a few centimeters of my
chair. I also love it for its&#39; elements of love, friends and sacrifice.
Well, I was pleased with the writers choice of adding characters from
the game such as Claire Redfield. Form the 2nd installment, Carlos
Oliviera and Nemesis were introduced. I felt that the writers gave
every character some say in the movie. Everything was clear and
straight-forward. Nothing was fuzzy for me. Yes, I would definitely ask
anyone to watch this movie. 8/10
