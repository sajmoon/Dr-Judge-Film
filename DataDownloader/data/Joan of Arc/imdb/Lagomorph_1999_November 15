1999_November 15 

Besson brings the same psychological depth, intensity, and intelligence to
his portrait of Joan that he brought to Leon in The Professional.  The film
resists the temptation to descend into a bathetic, jingoistic action film
(we are spared the ridiculous spectacle of the protagonist screaming
FREEEDOM! at the top of his/her lungs during the execution sequence) and
instead explores  the moral and spiritual paradoxes involved in attempting
to Do Good within a Christian world view.  That's not to say that the movie
is only for the religious (as I certainly am not to be counted among the
ranks of the elect); it should be of interest to anyone who enjoys
thoughtful and honest character drama.  The tragic ending effectively
converts historical fact to psychological necessity--Joan's
brilliantly-depicted final psychological struggle, helped along by Dustin
Hoffman's first rate performance as an incarnation of God/Satan/Joan's
psychology, is satisfying precisely because of its gothic ambiguity.
