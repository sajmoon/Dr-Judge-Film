Another viewer says:<br /><br />&quot; I watched this movie mostly because me and my brother
 have a small argument over which Joan of Arc movie 
 we bothered to pick as our fav.  The Leelee 
 Sobieski version or this version. &quot;<br /><br />Along with these recent films, it's worth mentioning two major icons of film
history that deal with Jeanne: Dreyer's 1928 &quot;La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc&quot;
(http://us.imdb.com/Details?0019254), and Bresson's 1962 &quot;Le Proc&egrave;s de
Jeanne d'Arc&quot; (http://us.imdb.com/Details?0059616).<br /><br />
