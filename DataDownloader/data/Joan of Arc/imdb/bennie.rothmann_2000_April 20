Luc Besson succeeds to capture the passion, the spiritual acceleration and
the mystery of the world of Joan of Arc. The cinematography was done
excellent including the acting from Milla Jovovich as the young Joan of Arc.
This is what I call a &quot;modern&quot; film where the visual effect enhances the
emotional and spiritual conflicts of the actors.<br /><br />The director's representation of the truth of the Christian faith and Joan's
spiritual gifts is however abstract, vague and sometimes spooky. I doubt the
historical accuracy of Joan's personal agony being portrayed in the
movie.
