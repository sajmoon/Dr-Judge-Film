Okay, the performances were great all around as in all of Luc Besson's
films, but this movie was terrible.  There was a neat concept, but dialog,
character development, and the pace just did not feel right at all for what
Luc Besson normally does.  I was very excited when this was to come out,
but
left very disapointed.
