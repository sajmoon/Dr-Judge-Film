The people that insist on bashing this film are close-minded, self-centered
morons.  First thing first, NO ONE REALLY KNOWS THE TRUE STORY.  She died
over 500 years ago.  No one that's alive today REALLY knows what happened.
So all you people moaning and groaning over how this depiction wasn't
accurate, well, you can go jump in a lake, because you weren't there, and
neither was anyone else that's with us today.<br /><br />How many movies exist about Vietnam and WWII?  Are they all the same?  Do
they all tell the EXACT same story?  Nope.  How about the story of Wyatt
Earp?  There are several movies about him, and they're not identical.  And
that's because no one really knows.  To bash the director for showing his
particular interpretation is simply ignorant.  If you believe that every
history book is 100% accurate, then I've got a whole briefcase of Rolex's I
can sell you.<br /><br />Granted, the acting lacked in places, and the attempts at humor weren't all
that humorous, but it was still a good film.  The cinematography alone was
outstanding, and I thought it was an excellent angle to take on Jeann's
life.  It was probably the best interpretation I've seen or heard so far.
It explored all possibilities.  But in today's world, we all know that she
was probably just a psychopath.  Yeah, she led battles that the French
weren't supposed to win but did, but hey, who thought we'd would beat the
English in the Revolutionary War?  Seriously, she was traumatized as a
child
and she went nuts, in all likelihood.  That seems to be the most
believeable
explanation, anyways.  But the crazies make the best warriors, don't they?
