Filming too similar to The Fifth Element probably related to Milla and Luc
working together in both. Does not represent Joan the way that we have
thought about her in history. It might have been a better movie if it wasn't
related to a specific person in history. Very strange religious elements.
Hard to decepher and left me feeling very upset. I would not recommend this
to anyone.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed, I usually love Milla's work.
