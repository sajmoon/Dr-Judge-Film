I have to say I don&#39;t really like the tone of this movie, this movie
was about a person that had some association with god, and I felt like
the vision imagery looked more satanic more than anything. One must
wonder what was on the mind of the people that were involved in the
direction of this film. I don&#39;t know the history of Joan Of Ark, but I
didn&#39;t like the way they portrayed this character. It was very dark and
disheartening as if there was treachery behind every corner throughout
the movie. I don&#39;t really think it helps the story nor what the
character represented to cast so much doubt on her actions. It would
have been better to come at the story from one angle. then to come at
it from all angels and confuse the audience as to what her intentions
really were. It seemed more like the story tellers are trying to
persuade the audience that people who believe in signs or a higher
power are less significant then people who primarily use their
intellect to make choices in life. From my experience the mind is only
a tool to be used when the need arises, but I don&#39;t think its a
complete substitute for relying on internal intuition. It up to
everyone to decide for themselves if their own intuition is an inherent
property of being human or part of something larger.<br /><br />That being said I think the films battle scenes and acting were well
done. I&#39;m sure allot of work went into it and I do appreciate the time
it took to make a film of this scale. I just wish they spent more time
creating a compelling story that trying to cast so much doubt on Joan&#39;s
actions which seemed more like a policial statement then anything else.
