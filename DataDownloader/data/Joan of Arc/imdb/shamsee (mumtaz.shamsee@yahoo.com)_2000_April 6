It just completely breaks my heart that a movie of such beauty and purity,
and of such high quality is completely ignored by the critics and the
masses. While American Beauty is at least according to the imdb polls second
most like movie of all time, this movie barely gets a passing grade. I guess
this is just the sign of times.<br /><br />Luc Besson has explored spirituality like the way it used to be. The
fifteenth century France comes to life, and we are all left mesmerized by
the beauty and courage that we witness.<br /><br />How can academy ignore Milla Jovovich's performance? This is just completely
ridiculous. I can not understand what more could she have put in the
character to make it better. The best part is that even today's kids, if
they ever get to watch it, will feel connected to the character because of
Besson's genius in presenting 15th century with a touch of 90's.<br /><br />A beautiful movie that you can watch with your family and be proud. Oh yes,
the action is as good as Braveheart if not better, and the scene where Joan
actually walks in with the troops into the enemy post, with the song in the
background, is one of the most beautiful and moving and inspiring scene ever
filmed, and is really an ode to joy of overcoming tyranny and
evil.<br /><br />If you miss this movie then you are missing a rare and precious
gem.
