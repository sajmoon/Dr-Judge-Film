The Messenger is very interesting and weird at the same time. I was
expecting a very touching and thrilling movie after I saw the amazing
trailer. Yes, the movie is very touching and thrilling but it's so, so slow
that you almost forget these qualities and instead of enjoying the final
scenes, you just want them to end. <br /><br />I enjoyed the beginning of the movie where they explained France's situation
making everything clearer for me and for anyone that don't even know who
Joan of Arc is (I'm not saying that I don't). Then there's about 1 hour
before Joan start to fight. This part is in general good but weird
sometimes. Joan's vision were boring and as I was expecting the great visual
effects shown in the trailer (the clouds moving, the plants involving her,
etc), I though it was disappointing. I was warned that the battle scenes
were very violent, disgusting and horrible, showing headless people and
body-parts. Yes, it was really violent but I thought the battles were the
best part of movie. At the same time I was excited, happy, confused and
impressed with Joan commanding a whole army. And Milla Jojovich did one
great Joan of Arc, with her fragile face but doing brave acts.<br /><br />Then we can watch Joan's tragic end. That was the worst part of the movie.
All the characters are bad now (and I was tired, with bad mood). But in that
&quot;worst part&quot; is the best thing about &quot;The Messenger&quot;: The Conscience! The
Conscience is the name given to Dustin Hoffman's character. Interrogating
Joan about her visions, the battles, the sword, ..., he make us ask to
ourselves: was Joan of Arc a saint, crazy or just a girl that though she was
a messenger of God? <br /><br />Many people might think that I'm crazy but I loved Jojovich's voice too! Her
huskies screams while she was commanding the armies and while she was being
judged were amazing.  <br /><br />So, &quot;The Messenger&quot; can be a bit slow and boring sometimes but it's a good
movie. And, obviously, costing 60 million dollars, it's very beautiful and
well-done, with monumental battle scenes, great art-direction and
cinematography... But it should be smaller.
