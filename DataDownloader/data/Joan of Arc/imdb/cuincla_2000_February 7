I was expecting an average movie, at least, but certainly I never expected
such a waste of time.  Joan of Arc is portrayed as a crazy woman, weak
sometimes, violent others, but not as a strong woman as you would expect of
someone who lived what she did. When you see so many good actors acting
badly, you really have to think there is a problem in the direction of the
film.  The worst part of the film is Milla, I just can't believe Joan could
have anything to do with her.
