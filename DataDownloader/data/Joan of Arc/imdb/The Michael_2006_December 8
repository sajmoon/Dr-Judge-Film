the Michael can understand that there are people who dislike this movie
because of its views on Joan, saying it&#39;s awful that they made her seem
crazy and the historical accuracy is bad and etc. But the Michael sees
not any problems with this movie. I say this not because my favorite
actress stars in it, (Milla Jovovich), but because this is a highly
dramatic movie (meaning good) and a thinking movie (if that makes sense
to people). The combination of scenes, music and emotions truly make
you think what it was like for Joan. Who cares if the movie made her
seem crazy. For all I know, she probably was. (with all due respect).
But my point is that is what the movie is trying to message, different
point of views. I do not think lowly of the real Joan, in fact, i
respect her more because of this movie. But if the film changed it&#39;s
views, I&#39;d probably dislike the MOVIE more because who wants to see
something they already know everything about? That is why Luc Besson is
a genius, and thats why this movie is a MUST SEE. the Michael has
spoken.
