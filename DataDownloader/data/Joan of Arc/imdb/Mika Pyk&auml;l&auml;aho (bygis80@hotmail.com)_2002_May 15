Trademark in almost all of Luc Besson's movies is the repeated quality that
his films are visually sensational experiences and &quot;The Messenger: The Story
of Joan of Arc&quot; makes no exception. It's a true visual work of art and a
real pleasure to watch. That still doesn't take away the fact that this film
is an extremely violent, very dark, dreary and cheerless picture. Milla
Jovovich handles the leading role splendidly. I have to confess that I find
her very attractive and charming, she's certainly one of my favorite
actresses. She's not as enrapturing and gorgeous in the role of Jeanne d'Arc
as she was in Besson's &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; where she played a character
called Leeloo but she's nevertheless quite cute in this one too. John
Malkovich makes just another excellent, stylish performance as Charles VII.
When it comes to Luc Besson's works I guess this isn't his best achievement.
It's clearly better than &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; but perhaps not as great as his
more modest project &quot;L&eacute;on&quot;. I've seen this movie twice and I can assure that
even though it's not a masterpiece it's undisputedly worth a
look.
