I think that the messenger had beautiful scenery, powerful imagery, and
very
interesting secondary character. Also, the inquisition part of the movie
was
very good. But I think that Joan's character was rather weak. She never
seemed really sure of herself, and did not irradiate charisma. her
character
was very much like that of Leeloo in the 5th Element. And I think that a
medieval woman, and a peasant as well, being received in the King's court
and given an army, leading two hundred thousand soldiers in war must have
had something special. The depiction of Joan as it is in the movie is
unrealistic. She would have needed an aura, and a very strong
will.<br /><br />But still I think that its very good movie and worth seeing.
