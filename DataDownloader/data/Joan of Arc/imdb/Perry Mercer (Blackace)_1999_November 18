1999_November 18 

I can take nothing away from the actors and actresses in this movie. John
Malkovich, Milla Jovovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman were excellent in
this movie. I was very impressed with Milla Jovovich's strong portrayal of
Joan of Arc. Can you believe this woman does modeling and sings? Let's see
Cindy Crawford or Claudia Shiffer do this kind of acting. Even though &quot;The
Fifth Element&quot; wasn't the greatest movie, Milla still gave a credible
preformance. She also wasn't bad in &quot;He Got Game&quot; either. In any case, this
movie was different in many ways. 
The director (Luc Besson) used many visual dreamscapes to tell the story of
how the lord gave Joan a message to visit the soon to be King Charles, form
an army and defeat the English. Of course no one believes her until she
succeeds in leading the French army through blockades and taking over forts.<br /><br />Yes the movie is a bit confusing. You see visuals of clouds, fields of
flowers with Joan running through them, the lord sitting in a stone chair,
and other misconceptions of a message coming from the heavens. You really
don't understand the whole thing until the end of the movie. Then again, you
still may not understand it. The war scenes are very violent and bloody.
Lots of decapitations and limbs flying everywhere. This movie is a bit long
too. It's about 155 mins., when it should have been about 130 mins. Many of
those dream sequences could have been cut shorter and some of the fight
scenes could have been cut back. But overall, the movie was decent and worth
seeing.
