2008_January 20 
A thoroughly entertaining film. Luc Besson has his own original eye for
what was thought to have already been done. Jeanne d&#39;Arc always seems
to have been shot from a hitherto unexplored perspective. Into this he
squashes comedy and melodrama as improbable but sparky bedfellows.
Milla Jojovich is perfect for this directorial mania -
polystyrene-brained naivete oscillates with shuddering fervour.<br /><br />Around this fascinating (if tomboyish) performance Besson builds a
posturing coterie of French military. The nuances of their handling can
be easily overlooked; there&#39;s a rhythm to how these brutish men sneer,
then come onside and move away again. Tch&eacute;ky Karyo&#39;s particularly good.
I might even have had to admit liking French soldiers were it not for a
balancing slew of loud-mouthed English knights.<br /><br />John Malkovich is of course a big draw on the poster, but it&#39;s
unsubstantiated - Faye Dunaway blows him offscreen. Exemplary
entertainment, if not factually irreproachable. 7/10
