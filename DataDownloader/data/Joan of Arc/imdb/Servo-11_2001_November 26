I'm not really well-versed in Joan of Arc's history, and since I'm smart
enough not to watch movies to learn history and believe everything they say,
I watched this to enjoy the sets, costumes and acting.<br /><br />I was really impressed with Milla Jovovich's performance, particularly when
she is in her cell and is wrestling with her conscience and when she is in
front of her accusers.  When her Conscience turns her thinking around to
trap her, the expression of realization on Jovovich's face is
heart-breaking.  All of a sudden she realizes that God may not have spoken
to her at all.  Perhaps she's a bit too fidgety and neurotic in her
movements, but so is Bette Davis and she's a legend!  Since Joan was such a
young girl, heard voices, and had led a successful campaign against a
powerful enemy, she can be as schizo as she wants as far as I'm
concerned.<br /><br />With the exception of John Malkovich (who I have yet to like in a
performance other than in Dangerous Liasons), I thought the supporting cast
was extremely well-chosen.  Vincent Cassel, Tcheky Karyo, Faye Dunaway, and
Dustin Hoffman as a wry Man in Black were all extremely interesting to
watch.  Different accents abounded (or none at all), but sometimes accents
detract from other things the actor is trying to do, like...oh, I don't
know...ACTING.<br /><br />On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I give this movie
8/10<br /><br />
