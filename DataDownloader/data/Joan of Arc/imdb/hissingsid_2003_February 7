2003_February 7 

(The first observation is a compliment, the second a criticism)<br /><br />Things to like about this film:<br /><br />1. Joan is quite plausibly in a state of psychological distress throughout
the story, and comes over as quite human as a result... she's not some
simplistically-presented figurehead.<br /><br />2. The Battle Scenes - if you like battle scenes, that is.  I do, and the
bit with the flail is lovely.<br /><br />3. Dustin Hoffman's thorough deconstruction and destruction of Joan's
advocacy of nationalist warfare in the name of God.  I bet he didn't like
Braveheart either.<br /><br />Things to laugh at in this film:<br /><br />1. &quot;LOAD THE PORKY-PINE!!!&quot;  Historically accurate I'm sure - it doesn't
make this particular war-cry any less silly.  What next, 'Fetchez le
Vache?'<br /><br />2. That English warlord who sounds pretty Scottish to me.  There's a guy who
obviously didn't even watch Braveheart.<br /><br />3. That bloke who played Weedy David in The Fifth Element.  Standing him
next to Jovovich for so much of the film's duration conjures inappropriate
comparisons.  Like if Braveheart had Max Von Sydow as Edward Longshanks and
Sam J. Jones as Wallace...  Which would probably have been fab, now I think
about it.<br /><br />4. Vincent Cassel as the smouldering Eurocrumpet Gilles de Rais.  Also an
alleged sadistic mass-murderer of children (de Rais, I mean!), but at least
he wasn't English, eh?<br /><br />5. John Malkovitch.  Is 'Being John Malkovitch' a film at all?  Is it not
rather a very short review of his acting style?
