We all like a good biopic, right? Not when it comes out all screwy,
like &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; does. Maybe it&#39;s the
(almost) laughable anachronisms. For example, a soldier sarcastically
says &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;; anyone who understands the evolution of English
knows that people didn&#39;t use &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; as an expletive in Medieval
Times. Later on, after Joan (Milla Jovovich) has been injured, someone
says &quot;She&#39;s nuts.&quot; COME ON, PEOPLE!!!!! In the 1400s, &quot;nuts&quot; was not a
synonym for &quot;crazy&quot;! Because of these misplaced comments - not to
mention other things - the acting comes out a lot weaker than it
should, given the supporting cast (Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, John
Malkovich).<br /><br />All in all, you feel like your brain just got warped after watching
this movie. Probably the worst kind of movie is one that had really
good intentions but got ruined through incompetence; this is definitely
one such movie. If nothing else, it&#39;s good to know that this didn&#39;t
ruin everyone&#39;s careers. The cast members have since made up for it.
But considering that Luc Besson has made such good movies as &quot;The
Professional&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, don&#39;t waste your time on this.
