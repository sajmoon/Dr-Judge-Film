1999_December 3 

Being French, i used to make fun of Besson and his films, although i never
had seen any one of them in a theatre. So i went to see his Jeanne d'Arc,
which had received rather good critics, even from his usual
enemies.
What a bore! It is really awful! You can actually see 3 parts in the
movie.
The first one is when Jeanne is young. It is completely silly, full of
horrible special effects when she has visions. Then come the battles, the
less worse of the parts. too bad Besson feels like he has to show us a
head
or arm being cut with a sword every two seconds. Finally, the trial, with
the conscience explaining us in an hour what we'd understood in a minute.
despairingly long.
Perhaps i'll give besson another chance in 20 years. till then, i'll know
what i make fun of.
