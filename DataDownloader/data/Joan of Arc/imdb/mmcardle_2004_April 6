There seems to have been some scathing comments about this film on the IMDB.
I'm no expert on Joan of Arc and so I can't comment on the historical
inaccuracies. As for the performances? That's a matter of opinion or
taste.<br /><br />I like this film a lot. I watched it as a film, rather than as a historical
document, and as such, I think it scores highly. Jeanne is portrayed as
deluded, fanatical, and flawed. Is it accurate? Probably not, but then again
name me one film that has EVER been historically accurate. Titanic was
criticised by the family of some of the liner's crew. JFK was criticised for
it's assumptions, deletions, and inaccuracies. Braveheart? Cleopatra? Don't
let's get started on them......<br /><br />It is impossible to make a film that accurately represents historical
events. Those events are gone and the best information we have is cloudy
memories or historical documents written from cloudy memories.<br /><br />The best the film-maker can do is provide an interpretation of those events
and entertain and/or challenge the audience. So you didn't agree with it. So
what? At least it made you think and there ain't enough of that
nowadays.
