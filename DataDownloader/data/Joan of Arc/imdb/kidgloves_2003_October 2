I absolutely love this movie. I remember the reviews being harsh at the
time
of release which was expected considering the subject matter. Personally
i
always get something out of Luc Besson films as they are so beautiful to
look at with sweeping camera shots that give an epic feel and this is no
different. The humour contrasts very well with some shocking scenes that
balance the film very well. Credit must also be given to the costume and
set
crew as the attention to detail is fantastic.
This is a film to get lost in (like any good film in my view) and enjoy.<br /><br />Forget about the historical events and enjoy filmmaking at its
best.<br /><br />8/10
