First of all, the story of Joan of Arc is biographical movie. A story not
create by some writers of Hollywood. The story is about a young girl who
lead an army to liberate his country, the France. The word France is maybe
the problem for someone. For someone who don't care of things not BORN IN
THE USA!!! For someone who want to see the movie for an happy end, go home
now! I saw a great historical movie. Probably, Milla Jovovich is not the
right actress to do the role, but it's not the case. In a much larger vision
of things, we have to see the sens of directing. It's an epic movie for
people loving history. <br /><br />9 out of 10
