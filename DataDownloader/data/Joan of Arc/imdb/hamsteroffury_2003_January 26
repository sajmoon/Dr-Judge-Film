People are understandably split on their views of The Messenger: Joan of
Arc.
To some is is jumbled, incoherent and badly acted...To others, myself
included it is brilliantly shot, well told, emotionally jerking AND WELL
acted!
Two things drew me to getting it on DVD - Luc Besson as director, and
Milla
Jovovich playing Joan. Besson's real commitment to filming, especially in
the action sequences really paid of, giving fantastic gritty and
beautifully
shot violence, the next minute balanced up with politics, intrigue and a
lavish French court. As the featurette tells us, Luc and has camera had to
wear armour in the battlescenes as they were right in amongst the action!
They put their lives on the line rushing through firey gates as
well!
Milla gives her strongest performance yet as Joan, capturing the tormented
young maiden perfectly. One that feels like she has been chosen by
God...until Dustin Hoffman's conscience character forces her to think of
possible alternatives.
Hoffman is superb and makes a small character his own completely. Some
people say that his 'psycho-babble' is out of place in the setting, but
when
balancing it with the fact that it is a Besson film looking into religion
and self-belief, it really hits home.
Perhaps Milla's best scenes are towards the end when she starts to put
across the confused, frightened and yet resolute character of Joan while
under trial and when at the stake.
Malkovich and Dunaway  give admirable performances with Dunaway playing
almost a pantomime &quot;Evil Stepmother&quot; to perfection.
Apart from a few 'cheesier' moments, this is quality moviemaking,
beautifully shot and strongly acted.
