1999_November 16 

While not as grand in scale as Mel Gibson's &quot;Braveheart&quot; (some photography
seemed slanted for no other reason than to hide the lack of extras), this is
essentially a remake of it, with the violent battle scenes, heroic speeches
and the strength of the hero to overcome prejudice against his/her fellow
man.<br /><br />Is it a good film?  Absolutely.  Should you see it?  Yes, please do, as it
gets a lot of the folklore about the real Joan of Arc right on, and the
historical period as well, other than John Malkovich playing a character who
was much, much younger (Neil Patrick Harris played him in the inferior, and
extremely inaccurate, TV movie), historically.<br /><br />Be you of faith or no, there's still something you can take away from this
film.  Just don't see it if you're overly depressed... the ending, like
&quot;Titanic&quot; is already in the history books.<br /><br />8 of 10.
