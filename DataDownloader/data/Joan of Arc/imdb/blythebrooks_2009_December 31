This movie was incredible! Great acting, charged battle scenes,
adrenaline charged fighting scenes! What really made the movie more
than just a &#x22;cool war movie&#x22; and more than just a historical
autobiography was that it sampled the many ways in which religion is
and can be used in this world; whether it be for &#x22;good&#x22; or &#x22;evil&#x22;
means. This movie proves that not only do people use and value their
relationships with God and/or religion for many different purposes,
some of those purposes can be self-serving, even if we don&#x27;t realize
it. I love how the movie makes the view analyze how religion can be
wonderful and sacred and promote change and compassion throughout
people; but it can also be used to manipulate, control and conquer. But
is this the fault of God? Is it the fault of God if we &#x22;misread&#x22; or
&#x22;misunderstand&#x22; his signs? Should we impose the negative consquences
that us mortals burden religion with because we are unenlightened in
comparison to a Holy God? What causes people to believe or not believe
in God? Do our mistakes from the misuse of religion in God&#x27;s name give
religion a bad name? How can we stop people, or countries from using
religion to discriminate against others in hopes of conquoring land or
money? This movie provoked all of the questions and many more, making
it a new favorite of mine! Lastly, how do we decide if those who kill
in God&#x27;s name are accurately interpreting his will? At what point must
we destroy in order to create? More importantly, when do we know it is
God&#x27;s will? What does God think of us killing in his name? Just a few
things to think about and I feel this movie showed Joan struggling with
all of these questions as well.
