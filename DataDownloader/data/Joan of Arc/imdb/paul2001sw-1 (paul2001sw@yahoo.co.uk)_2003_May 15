Joan of Arc was a French peasant girl who believed she received messages
from God and who somehow was given control of an army in the Hundred Years
War.  How this came about is unfortunately no clearer after watching this
high-budget, glossy but misfiring film.  Sadly it fails on every front: the
court scenes are unconvincing, the battle scenes are logically scrambled,
while the trial scenes are anachronistic and simply hysterical.  The
dialogue is pretty rotten too, for example, every character is introduced
complete with a description of their attributes (e.g. &quot;meet my bravest
archer&quot; etc).  Milla Jovovich is frankly out of her depth as Joan,
over-emoting in every scene.  The rest of the cast is much better, though
the decision to use Americans as Frenchmen and Englishmen and Englishmen
sometimes makes you think it's a different war altogether.  While
stylistically, the film is pretentious, incoherent, and ultimately dull. 
Beaten by even &quot;Braveheart&quot; for historical accuracy, &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; resembles
Ken Russell's &quot;The Devils&quot; but fatally without that film's sense of fun. The
only liberation comes with the end.
