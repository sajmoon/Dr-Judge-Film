This is a very good movie. It is essentially an epic war-movie like
Braveheart. In fact, there are lots of similarities with Braveheart. A
commoner uniting the people against an invading enemy (heh...the English in
both movies), supported by the commoners but mistrusted by the
nobles.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is great as Jeanne d'arc. She has a very nice look, as she
can look really frail and fierce at the same time. Now, after I've seen it,
I can't imagine seeing another actress in the role.<br /><br />Richard Ridings as La Hire is also very good, he and Vincent Cassel (Gilles
de Rais) (I think it was him at least) lend the movie some great humour,
with Jeanne berating La Hire (a grizzled veteran campaigner) for swearing
all the time.<br /><br />Jane Valentine as the young Jeanne is also very good.<br /><br />The movie has some very good (and graphic) battle scenes. They are almost
up
to Braveheart quality.<br /><br />All this is enough to make a really good movie, but what makes this one a
10/10 is the fact that we are given the choice to decide for ourselves
wether we want to believe that her visions were sent from god, satan or if
they were merely hallucinations. This is a great touch, as it makes the
movie much better for us Atheists. The movie also shows the darker side of
religion during the middle-ages (and sadly, today), how religion and the
name of god was used to justify horrible wars and torture. The final
seconds
of the film are very symbolic... wait and see...<br /><br />Hoffman does a great (and somewhat humorous) performance as The
Conscience.<br /><br />Couple all this with a stunning soundtrack by the great Eric Serra and you
have a classic on your hands. I will definately buy this on DVD as soon as
it is out.<br /><br />/Thomas Wes&eacute;n
