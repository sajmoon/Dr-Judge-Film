2000_September 3 

It was long time ago (about 3 or 2 months ago), when I wrote my emotional
resume about movie. I was in hope that many people slowly will understand
meaning of Besson's version and in the same way will understand HOW and WHY
Besson makes movies.
But it's seems so that US mainstream movie making style makes most people
blind to other possibilities and visions. YES, it's good to be wealthy and
live comfortably, but it's best to be a human being.
Why I'm saying this? Because most of you have a imagination of Joan as
true,
brave, clear-in-mind, good looking 17 years old girl, who saved France.
Yes,
but it's just a IMAGINATION. No one can know how she actually was. And
remember this - it's not Jesus Christ or someone else, who's character and
outer appearance is created by our minds, if we honest. She was a real
person, real girl with her fears (maybe you will say that she didn't have
them at all?), doubts, weaknesses (everyone is weak in some kind) and great
skills. Besson simply makes his own version about her, but still let door
be
open.
You don't like it? You maybe even don't like that we can't know these
historical persons? That we can't know what really happened that time? It's
annoying? Yes it is. But better annoying true than sometimes stupid and
sweet lies.
And at the end I maybe will repeat myself: Besson makes movies about
humans,
not dolls. His characters - we can cry on them, that they are doing wrong,
can suffer with them, feel sad about them, we can do everything, except
denying them.
P.S. Mostly Besson don't makes movies only for money, that's sure. In US,
biggest part of movie industry do. That's sad.
