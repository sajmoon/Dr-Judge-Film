If you are wondering about Luc Besson&#39;s vaguely heretical &quot;The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot;, try to imagine a cross between
&quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate&quot;. It looks great but the basic story
gets lost in the histrionics and excess. <br /><br />There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a
savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have
eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years
after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were
responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history
at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V&#39;s piety and he got a
great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped
out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France.
Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning
to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who
were having leadership problems. <br /><br />Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was
on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the
victory over another team that apparently God did not favor. <br /><br />Although there are records of both of Joan&#39;s trials (her Condemnation
Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own
political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson&#39;s
film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but
takes obvious liberties with Joan&#39;s mental condition and visions. There
is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as
plausible as any other speculation. <br /><br />What hurts &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; is that Besson&#39;s
best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for
the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young
Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was
not confined to Natalie Portman&#39;s performance in &quot;Leon&quot;. This early
stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that
you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start
than any film in cinema history. And the sequence where the young Joan
is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as
visually stunning as anything ever filmed.<br /><br />But once Milla Jovovich&#39;s grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will
find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It&#39;s not miscasting,
Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see &quot;The
Dummy&quot;) rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the
take Besson wanted on Joan&#39;s personality. The problem is that while a
viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just
repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is
a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama. <br /><br />But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning
sequences. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I&#39;m only a child.
