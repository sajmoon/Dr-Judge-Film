Milla Jovovich may have been the only woman who could have portrayed a
'Joan' believable enough for such a film and approach as that taken by Luc
Besson, one which stops just short of suggesting some sort of 'shamanic
visionary' as opposed to a character labelled everything from 'deranged
schizophrenic' to 'lesbian', simply due to attire, while 'hearing voices'
(all historical facts). The key ingredient: the eyes. Not since Faye
Dunnaway's unforgetable portrayal in &quot;The Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; (1976), who
coincidentally co-stars as an excellent Yolande d'Aragon herewith, has
someone captivated an audience simply by a look or a glance. Spell-binding,
riveting, and as true to the historical record as one can expect for this
most noble of French heroines, while adding a plausible childhood, Besson,
Jovovich, an excellent supporting cast and the film were all but ignored
for
the honours they so richly deserved.  Rating five stars (of five) and a
film
I'll never forget!
