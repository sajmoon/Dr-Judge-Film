What's wrong with this picture?
In a word, everything.
Watching a buck-toothed, grasshopper-of-a-Joan cavort through the woods
for
the first twenty minutes was excruciating enough, but when the audience
was
subjected to perhaps the most gratuitously violent rape scene to grace the
silver screen this year, the groans were audible even above the
psychedelic
medieval soundtrack.
A Gallic-looking Jesus stares from his chair in the woods.  Then he and
Joan
cavort some more.  Woodstock meets the Thirty Years War.  Didn't she see
saints?  I guess Joan isn't Catholic anymore.  Too hard to
explain.
Joan becomes a woman.  Joan goes to war.  Her captains are likeable
cartoon
characters.  They disappear midway through the film, and are never
mentioned
again.  The audience, over their initial horror, can only gape,
mute.
Joan is tried.  Joan burns.  No one is surprised.  We're just glad that
the
argumentative Dustin Hoffman character won't nitpick anymore.  The
audience
hopes he burned up with her.
Didn't France--motivated by Joan's sacrifice--unify and kick those pesky
English out?  Yes, but Luc Besson apparently didn't find such details
worthy
of mentioning.  But--mon Dieu!--that burning dummy looked so
realistic!
The movie ends, abruptly.  Credits roll.  The audience doesn't
complain--we're happy to have the lights come up again.  Makes it easier
to
find the exit.
Luc Besson has surely been replaced by a pod person with little
talent.
Save yourself.  Save seven bucks.  Borrow the video from the idiot
(pronounce it the French way, now) who purchases it.
