what is that thing I have just spent two hours watching?
An utter disappointment.
An ugly, absolutely not amusing caricature.
A farce in the worst sense of the word.<br /><br />As a scholar of Medieval Studies, I can firmly attest that the movie called
The Messenger: the Joan of Arc story, has nothing to do either with
medieval
Europe or the story of Joan of Arc. So, if you sit in front of your TV and
assume that Joan of Arc has never existed and is Luc Besson's own fruit of
imagination, this might not be an exceptionally disgusting experience.
Especially, if you enjoy the type of women Milla Jovovich belongs
to.
Speaking about her, she might be considered a beautiful woman who likes to
change her color contacts much too often. She might be a talented model.
However, she is not actress. At least, not a dramatic actress. Perhaps, she
would be able to succeed in a role of a contemporary prostitute. Or an
undecipherable image of some fantastic creature who can hardly pronounce
two
distinctive words - like she was in The Fifth Element.<br /><br />If you like films about war, you are better off renting Braveheart or
Gladiator. If you like historic films about beautiful ladies, rent
Dangerous
Liaisons with Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer. If you like watching
models
do their best, tune into The Victoria Secret's show.<br /><br />You might consider renting The Messenger only if you want to see John
Malkovich in a new role. However, even in The Ladies' Room he's got a far
more better part.
