I saw The Messenger recently, and I was honestly blown away. Quite
frankly, I thought it was brilliant.<br /><br />For a start, I thought Milla Jovovich's performance was simply amazing.
While she may have been wasted with things like Resident Evil:
Apocalypse of late, she really is a superb actress when given the right
script. I thought she actually showed a great deal of potential in The
Fifth Element, despite the genre of that film limiting the chances to
show any real acting ability.<br /><br />Not so here. As well as getting to kick ass in her normal manner, she
also turns in a great dramatic performance, and really makes you feel
the emotions her character is going through. She has a wonderful
vulnerable quality (which was demonstrated admirably in The Fifth
Element)... Winona Ryder is about the only other actress I can think of
with the same talent in this regard.<br /><br />There's also an extremely able supporting cast. Despite having an
accent that's completely out of place, John Malkovich is great as
Charles. Vincent Cassell also turns in a good performance in a role
which could have been merely comic relief, but one which he drags to a
level above that (although he looks distractingly like Matthew Lillard
at times). Faye Dunaway does well with a character who doesn't exactly
exude personality, while Dustin Hoffman... well, Dustin Hoffman is
there.<br /><br />I also thought the look of the film was fantastic. The realism of the
battle scenes is impressive, and Luc Besson's direction really brings
them to life. No punches are pulled and we see people decapitated,
amputated and maimed all round... and hey, who doesn't enjoy a good
decapitation now and then? I also thought the costumes were great,
especially those of Faye Dunaway's character. The costumes of the
extras and minor characters also look fantastic, and it adds an extra
level of realism to the look of the film.<br /><br />As for the story... well, I find it hard to comment. I'll admit that
I'm pretty ignorant of the real tale of Joan of Arc, so I have no idea
how closely this adaptation sticks to it. What I will say is that I
found the story the film presents engrossing, and despite the fact I
had originally planned to watch only an hour of the film before
switching over, it hooked me, and kept me hooked until the very end.<br /><br />I did feel the film had one weakness however -- nothing about Joan is
ever really explained. We never find out if her visions were really a
message from God, or merely a product of her own imagination. Her
mental state and ability are well represented during the film
(especially with Jovovich's great performance), but there are no clear
answers about her character. I guess this is designed to let the
audience believe whatever they want to, but I'd have preferred a more
committed stance from the film itself as to the how and why of Joan of
Arc.<br /><br />I'd never even heard of this film prior to seeing it. It was simply
something I started watching to pass the time while waiting for
something else to start, but I'm glad I chose to watch it. I think it's
a strong contender for a place on my top twenty list.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
