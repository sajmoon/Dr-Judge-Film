This is a masterpiece, that has been crafted in the hands of Luc Besson.
Milla Jovovich is great in the part as Joan, she is great in showing her
fear of the great responsibility she has been given as she is the messenger
of God. Milla and Dustin are great<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie run to the nearest cinema and see it you will
be taken away by it.
