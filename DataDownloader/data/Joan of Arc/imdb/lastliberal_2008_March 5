Luc Besson (L&eacute;on, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Danny the
Dog, Transporter 1, 2, and 3)) can always be depended upon to present a
film worth watching. Here he gives us a story of Joan of Arc that will
probably not answer question from those who are interested in her.<br /><br />Was she developmentally disable? Most Likely. Was she mentally ill? Is
seems that she probably was. Besson presents an argument for both, but
that is not his primary focus.<br /><br />It is in the battles where he focuses his energy and craft. We see
graphic images of war with severed heads and limbs, and medieval
weapons that excite and entertain us.<br /><br />We also see the corruption of the Catholic Church during that period
and their focus more on political power than doing god&#39;s work.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element) was a perfect Joan of
Arc, with just the right qualities.<br /><br />John Malkovich was also good as Charles VII.<br /><br />I always enjoy Vincent Cassel and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, and neither
disappointed me.<br /><br />Besson is one of my favorites and I can&#39;t wait for transporter 3.
