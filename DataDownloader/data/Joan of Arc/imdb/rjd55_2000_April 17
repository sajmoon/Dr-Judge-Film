Milla's portrayal of Joan of Arc was painful to watch. There was no reason
to believe this raving lunatic had any clue as to how to win a battle. She
was always mad. It was so annoying. I kept waiting for her to say
'multi-pass&quot;. The whole thing with Dustin Hoffman....where did he come from
and why? I wanted to like this movie but after two hours I just turned it
off.
