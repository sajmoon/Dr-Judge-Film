Some people commenting on this movie obviously have little or no
knowledge of history or art whatsoever. <br /><br />This film is by far the best portrayal of the era I have ever seen. The
Middle Ages were full of blood, madness,fear, wars, death,disease,
religious fanaticism, superstition, and hysteria. And this movie
depicted it all so well and so stunningly, as if it were now. The
settings, the costumes, the hairstyles, everything was superbly
authentic. <br /><br />I can only imagine what it takes to make such a movie. It makes you
feel as if those times come to life and this makes the movie
unforgettable. Of course if you prefer to watch rose-tinted movies
about a history that never was and people who never were as they are
depicted, it&#39;s up to you. This movie however is head and shoulders
above many of the blockbusters we have got used to watching. IT IS PURE
ART!
