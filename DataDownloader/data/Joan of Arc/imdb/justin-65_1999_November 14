1999_November 14 

What was interesting about this film was that it had a lot of focus on
the
non-historical parts of the story.  Meaning there was a lot of attention
paid to Joan of Arc's psyche and the visions she had, so this isn't a
documentary.  I think they did it very well.<br /><br />One thing that made me uneasy after a while was their continued use of
some lens (I'm not a camera person) for every shot of Joan, where in most
movies it's only used for a few dramatic shots.<br /><br />And every part with Dustin Hoffman's character was great.  Not just
because of his acting, but also the scene cuts to the visions, the visions
themselves (3 months after death...), and the way he moved about her
mind.
