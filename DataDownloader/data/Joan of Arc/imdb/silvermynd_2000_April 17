Very historically accurate movie, great acting, great scenery, great battle
scenes, great photography, very good music.
Besson is a Kubrick people understand and enjoy more easily.
From the Big Blue, to the dark Nikita, the sweet Professional, the
underground Subway.. The Messenger is a beautiful picture.
