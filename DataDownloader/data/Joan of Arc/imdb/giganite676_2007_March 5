2007_March 5 
About a year ago, the wife and I rented and watched The Messenger.
Memory is a bit fuzzy, but I remember it being quite good. The most
interesting thing is the role that this little girl &quot;mystic&quot; actually
played in martialing French society. Not knowing much about Joan D&#39;Arc,
I did not find the movie to be that controversial, and thought it was a
quite visionary glimpse of life 500 years ago, as well as the inner
workings of religious-inspiration swirled with ethnic/nationalism
toward the end of the Middle Ages. Evidently, quite a few adherents of
Saint Joan found it to be literally heretical. The movie is probably
not well suited for family viewing, nor for those who prefer a more
sanitized view of French history or Saint Joan. But it is quite
entertaining and compelling if you have some tolerance for
uncompromising, sometimes even brutal images of the past.
