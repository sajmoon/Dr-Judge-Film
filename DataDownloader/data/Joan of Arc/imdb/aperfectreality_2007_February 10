Luc Besson has always provided material worth watching. This time he
gives his art a more psychological angle, with audience left in
practical aimless controversy. This is a film, like &#39;The Fountain&#39; or
&#39;Jacob&#39;s ladder&#39;, which, everyone who has seen its entirety, has
something different to say about it. How do we depict historical
figures anymore? Should it be so constricted as a high school history
book? With hardly any identity whatsoever? Besson has definitely
crafted quite a piece, in this. If you have previously seen any of the
French guy&#39;s previous work, you would be able to pinpoint who exactly
was behind the scene&#39;s, and what makes such cinematography shine. He
used Milla Jojovich again, and must have originally appreciated her
performance in &#39;The Fifth element&#39;. This time though, she is not a
divine prophesied being, beforehand. But with the tables turned,
someone talked about, after their monumental behavior within incidents.
You don&#39;t exactly know what to think, but have respect for such a
person with so much love and drive for France, that they are willing to
give up their life for such a piece of land. And accordingly, wound up
doing so. It was kind of left with the message, that you never really
know what goes on inside a historical figure. Only that, like all of
us, there are constantly on a premise in which to work things out
within themselves.
