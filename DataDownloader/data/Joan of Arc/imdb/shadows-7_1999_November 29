1999_November 29 

Most of the historical movies are very serious or sombre (&quot;Elizabeth&quot; for
instance). &quot;The Messenger&quot;, however, breaks this tradition and pushes
forward with a very modern approach by mixing off beat humor, a strong
objective prospective, and an emphasis on style. Unfortunately some movie
critics looked down upon this approach, while I found it entertaining. I
think some would call this &quot;MTV style.&quot;<br /><br />But that's not all. The finest aspect of the movie is its objective
no-nonsense take on Joan's visions and whether or not she was on a
receiving
end of a conversation with God. Throughout the movie hints are sprinkled,
and you are constantly made to wonder what was really behind the young girl
who performed a miracle (or did she even contribute to
it?)<br /><br />In this, Milla Jovovich, I think, did great. Her acting may seem like it's
&quot;over acting&quot; at times but I think most of it was very intentional.
Considering both the questions raised by the movie, and Jovovich's acting
in
the climax and ending, it would seem that over acting played its part
well.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie, and I think others may have enjoyed it more if
they went in expecting something a little different. If anything leave the
question of her divinity open throughout the movie and things may fall into
place more comfortably.
