I found &quot;Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; to be a complex and compelling
movie. I had just finished a short historical paper on Joan of Arc a week
earlier, so when I happened upon this movie on television I paused. I found
myself enraptured with the warm richness of the photography in this film.
Once my senses were captive, I settled into the story. I anticipated that
the movie would unfold in a predictable way, but it does not. Frankly, I was
rather jarred by the added twists and experienced some uneasiness, but I
continued to watch. Later, I realized how brilliant this version of the
story is; it shook me out of my complacency and made me ponder down paths
rarely trodden. It features a fine performance by Milla Jovovich. It is rare
for a 'model' to transition into acting in a satisfying way, but I find
depth in Milla. She is able to communicate vulnerability in a very
believable manner. I was surprised and gratified to see her add dimension to
the character, displaying a steely core of passion and resolution. I highly
recommend this movie for those individuals that can tolerate the unexpected
and enjoy ruminating on a movie later.
