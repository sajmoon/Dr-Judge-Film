As a Christian believer (not a catholic) I enjoyed this movie very
much. It shows the fact that Joan was just a believer and a human being
which God chose to deliver his message. All believers are saints
according to the bible because we are washed white as snow by the blood
of the Lamb. Every believer struggles between Gods calling in their
life and the world (and the prince of this world). I think this movie
showed that struggle in Joan's life. She was a saint and a martyr. I
enjoyed her early conflict with the French generals that ended in their
willingness to give their life for hers. My only negative was that the
film maker chose the phrase that they did in the English generals
response to her at the Tower of Torrel. I think he should have used the
phrase &quot;Pluck Yew&quot; (you can find the history of this on Google).
