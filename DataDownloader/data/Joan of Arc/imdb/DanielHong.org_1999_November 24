1999_November 24 

To me, this movie was like &quot;Snow White.&quot; You know the story but you wouldn't
mind watching twice or more. Why? I think because the story is unreal but
you can even put yourself in her shoes and be fantasied as her. Well, I
watched this movie through T.V. The story was basically same but the actor
and actress were different (of course). But there was something different
about this movie from the T.V. All the actors and actress had powerful tone
in their voice. It felt Real as the war and the crisis were happening right
next you.
