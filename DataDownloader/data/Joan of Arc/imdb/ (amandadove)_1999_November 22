1999_November 22 

I know that so many people out there just absolutely hated this film, but
I
enjoyed it through and through! I realize that it is nothing to be used as
a
historical reference, although neither was &quot;The Last Temptation of
Christ.&quot;
It is a very creative interpretation and was brilliantly done, Milla
Jovovich is an incredible actress, and played her role with perfection. I
think what may have disturbed people was the way the religion, and the
religious figures were portrayed. They were very disturbing. Joan had what
is called The Sight. Most of us  have seen The Sixth Sense, and understand
quite well what that entails. I, myself, have the gift of The Sight, and
see
things that a lot of professionals cannot explain. I live a normal life,
and
have never taken any drugs, or even prescription drugs of that sort. Joan
of Arc probably saw things and in her own interpretation became religious
figures, such as angels, and gods. In a time where the Catholic Church was
so powerful and dominating, it is no wonder that in this story Joan saw
and
was moved by the things that she soon did. And it is no wonder she was
burned at the stake. She had a gift that she could not fully use, or even
understand because of the negative influence of the Catholic Church. I
loved
the film, and understood every motive behind the film.
