This movie really can't decide what it is.  Is it a tale of a girl's
struggle to reconcile faith?  Is it an action film based loosely on
historical events?  In battle, Joan runs around and screams, confused and
shaking most of the time.  Do we sense her torment at the momentousness of
what she is leading?  No.  Instead our fearless director gives us a battle
with no sense of  direction or staging.  Just running around--slicing and
dicing.  He also throws in some comic relief in the form of larger-than-life
soldiers who can scare away two English soldiers with just a growl (that's
original).  And what of our supporting cast of accomplished actors?  They
stand around most of the time acting eccentric but lack any
characterization.  Joan is much the same.  There is a shallow attempt to
give her motivation and some music video-esque visions, but she sings one
tune throughout the entire film and Milla Jovovich lacks the acting arsenal
to bring weight to the character.  There is some redemption in her
conversations with Dustin Hoffman's character, but, unfortunately, that
character is unnecessary to this film.  Basically, The Messenger comes off
as a film with no center, no clear purpose, and turns a powerful conclusion
into something you just want the film to get over with so you can get on
with your life.
