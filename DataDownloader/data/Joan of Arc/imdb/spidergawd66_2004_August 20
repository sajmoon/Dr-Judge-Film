This movie is not close to the actual events that took place 500 or so
years ago. I have read all of Joan's testimony (as recorded by the
English) and nothing even remotely resembles the &quot;Conscience&quot; scenes.
Not to mention that the movie is premised on a lie (by Joan's own
testimony, she had a happy childhood - her sister was not murdered and
raped) and Joan never described her visions as portrayed in the movie. <br /><br />If you skip the movie's version of her childhood and captivity, as well
as all the &quot;vision&quot; scenes in between, then you'll have a better
portrait of Joan (albeit not a complete portrait). She was in fact
impatient but also very caring (she wept for both the English and
French dead and dying as well as praying with wounded soldiers
regardless of their nationality).<br /><br />I think the topic the movie was trying to explore - is she divinely
inspired or crazy - is a fair topic. There were those even within
Charles VII court who thought her &quot;mad&quot; and Joan testified herself that
many did not believe her. The problem is that the movie just made
things up to highlight one point of view which in the end destroyed its
credibility. The movie critics quite completely trashed this movie
because of this and rightfully so.<br /><br />Many will watch this movie and think this is based on historical facts
which is very lamentable. Joan is a remarkable figure in her own right
and doesn't deserve any of these silly embellishments.
