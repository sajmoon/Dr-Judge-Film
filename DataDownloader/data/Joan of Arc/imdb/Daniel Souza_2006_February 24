A must-see if you enjoy medieval movies without orcs and elfs and
wizards nonsense. God knows that one Gandalf is enough.<br /><br />BUT BE WARNED, if you are one of those people that cries about
historical inaccuracy, them don't even bother to see this or ANY OTHER
Hollywood movie.<br /><br />I just don't understand why some people still bother to complain about
historical inaccuracy. All movies has it.<br /><br />Everyone loved Braveheart even knowing &quot;I hope&quot; that Willian Wallace
wasn't a good guy at all, in fact, was one damn mean Scotsman.<br /><br />8/10 just because it's in English instead of french.
