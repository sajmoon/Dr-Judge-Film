1999_November 19 

The Messenger was by far one of the true Epics of the late nineties.  The
Actors in this film had great dialog.  I think that the Medieval Battle
Scenes were some of the greatest ever shot.
Dustin Hoffman should be up for an Academy Award for his brief but powerful
performance and the Conscience.  Supremly Powerful acting
there.
Though I must say that John Malkovich was poorly cast as the King.  It was
just not a role for him.
The Soundtrack is powerful.  Not to sound sick but the music that was
played
during her execution was powerful and added well to the emotion of the
scene.<br /><br />All in all...I give this film.   9/10.
