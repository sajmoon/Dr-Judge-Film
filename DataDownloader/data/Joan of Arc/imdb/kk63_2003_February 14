2003_February 14 

Since I read Mark Twain's &quot;Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc&quot;, I have
deep reverence for Joan. I don't know what these people were trying to do
when they made this movie. It is historically incorrect and full of profane
remarks. As far as my knowledge is concerned, Joan never doubted about her
cause, neither when she was leading the army nor in the court. Her rock
solid confidence and high morals were the attributes that made other people
believe in her leadership. She was patriotism and courage embodied.<br /><br />I wish if somebody take the historical facts and make the movie as such
without inducing any nonsense.
