This film was painful. Considering the tale of Joan of Arc itself isn't
all that complicated, the movie wandered a whole lot with no apparent
idea of where the hell it was going. Worse yet, Besson's solution to
the aimless mess was to pile on irrelevant clutter. An opening scene
featuring a gratuitous corpse-rape, anyone? Hokey special effects
(especially in the damn meadow)? Supposedly French guys with British
accents? Melodramatic score? Ugly battle scenes lacking in dynamic?
Heavy-handed dialogue?<br /><br />Worst of all in this movie, though, were the casting and acting. Milla
Jovovich seemed to think that somehow she could compensate for her
inability to convey her character by filling every screen moment with
intense gazes and frantic over emotion (which are obviously not the
point in a story like this). Dustin Hoffman's role as her conscience
was just ludicrous, his delivery rote. John Malkovich's and Faye
Dunaway's regal roles were equally baffling; both actors could've been
reading off of teleprompters for what the film required of them. <br /><br />I needn't dwell on the vagaries of -The Messenger-'s failure;
obviously, Besson was in over his head, because it's an atrocious film
from start to finish. I've always been fascinated by the story of Joan
of Arc, but not even halfway through it this god-awful thing had me
muttering under my breath, &quot;Just burn her already.&quot; Just stick with
Dreyer's -Passion of Joan of Arc-, and don't bother with this.
