I have always thought Besson would make good videoclips... But when it
comes
to a 3 hours one it's a bit too much... I left the theatre exhausted but
not
blasted... OK, this film is entertaining but what... It looks more like a
attempt to make a historical epic than a renewal of the style... So many
cliches (I expected Charles Ingalls to appear after the first scene when
Jeanne as a kid is running through the fields...) that you don't know if
Besson is taking his film seriously or not...<br /><br />You actually don't know if he's taking Jeanne d'Arc seriously or not as she
appears to be either this messenger of God or a complete lunatic, and
wherever the answer is, the result is the same : she's the hell of a
hysteric. And Milla Jovovivch is just perfect for crying rivers of tears
and
shouting around...
Disapppointing performance which ruins all the ambiguity of the
character...
However beautiful she is, she is just not an actress.<br /><br />Supporting cast is good, right, but so mechanical, Malkovich and Hoffman
are
type-cast and are performing with far to much ease to give intensity and
credibility to their parts, they basically look bored.
I have great respect for Faye Dunaway who was asked to do a remake of Verna
Lisi's tremendous performance as Catherine de Medici in Queen Margot... But
even with the same haircut (and a horrible make-up, this blue vein is
awfully unrealistic) she doesn't get there...
Anyway, I don't blame her for that... It's more the script that mistreats
these court intrigues and make them more an easy and fast way (because the
bloody film's almost 3 hours long already !) to get Jeanne
burnt...<br /><br />Fortunately, a few of the actors have fun here... I'm talking about Tcheky
Karyo and Vincent Cassel who really enjoy being in a war movie... But here
again, it's looks more like they're purely having fun as actors (not much
as
being their characters). Anyway, they didn't have much choice as their
characters count so little in the whole thing...<br /><br />The soundtrack is most irritating, I can't remember of a single fraction of
a second when you don't get background music... and of the most un-original
kind...
Some scenes would be so much stronger if they were actually silent... But
no, Mr Besson is probably afraid that the audience would fall asleep and
gives a tedious rythm to his movie thanks to Eric Serra's heavy Carmina
Burana-like and ridiculous electronic fantasy noises... I thought I'd turn
deaf before the end of the whole thing...<br /><br />Once again, Besson has sacrified a script that could have been interesting
for the sake of style...
He's feeding us with an awful lot of cliches and instead of renewing a
genre, which is obviously his pretention, he's turning it into a rather
boring farce in which actors are just doing what they're asked to do
because
they get so little freedom to actually perform.
