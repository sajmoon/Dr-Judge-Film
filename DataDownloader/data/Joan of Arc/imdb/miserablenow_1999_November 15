I'm kinda jaded when it comes to hollywood movies, but this one was so
powerful and made me feel so many different emotions that I left the
theater
absolutely stunned. No movie has ever really done that to me before. And I
think I needed that in my life right now. I could go on and on babbling
about what i liked and disliked about the movie, but it would be
pointless.
It's something you have to see for yourself. For me it's a very personal
movie and there's definately a message to be heard. The question is, are
you
willing to listen ?
