What kind of teenaged tomboy would be able to lead grown men into battle
against tremendous odds in 15th Century France?  Watch this film to find out
-- Milla Jovovich delivers an absolutely splendid performance of the
unlikely person whose story would smolder for 500 years before she was
canonized a saint.  Perhaps this isn't a very glamourous role for the
multitalented (actor, model, musician, to name a few) Milla, but it is
without a doubt one of her best.  And without out a doubt, the free spirit
of Joan of Arc in Milla Jovovich that brings this film to life.  Definitely
worth seeing again and again.<br /><br />       <br /><br />
