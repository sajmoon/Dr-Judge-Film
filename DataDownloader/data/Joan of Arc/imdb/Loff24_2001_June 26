We are already used to the original depictions Lus Besson did of humans on
screen. How would he do with real events this time? I'm happy to say he
suceeded. We are somewhat used to the regular &quot;automatic pilot&quot; depictions
of Joan's life, the woman who loved god above all things and believed she
was sent to save her people from the clutches of the British. But here we
are entitled to a much more personal point of view: Besson's eye for Milla
is particularly sensible, and we notice she as a particular shine no other
character has. Therefore, we establish an empathy with her which starts even
when she is only a child. The movie has a great period detail, and some
incredible sequences, but, for some reason, it is the film by Besson that
grabbed me the least, I can't explain why, although that isn't saying that I
didn't like. In fact, I think there are things about this movie I haven't
seen nowhere else, specially all the scenes where Joan hallucinates and has
visions of God. This movie is totally different from all medieval adventures
we have seen so far, and its shots are Luc Besson's own. The all-stellar
cast helps a lot, and Dustin Hoffman turn out welcome at the end. The battle
scenes are a wow!Thierry Arboghast's cinematography helps a lot to establish
a cool look of medieval times, specially when fire is concerned. Eric
Serra's score reaches depth levels he has never reached before. A great film
altogether, which deserves to be seen with the heart willing to take
whatever we get from it. The title song &quot;My Heart Calling&quot; is one of the
most beautiful Eric Serra wrote for the movies. I recommend it for Besson
fans who will like certainly, and to all the others who aren't, just for the
fun of a different depiction of Joan's life.
