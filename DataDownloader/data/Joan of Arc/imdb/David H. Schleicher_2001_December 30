Okay, so maybe Milla Jovovich wasn&#39;t the best choice for the lead....
Most reviews I have read treated this movie as if it was an all out
disaster. Sometimes blasphemous, sometimes painful to watch, sometimes
a bit too strange, but always captivating, this is a movie that
deserves to be recognized. There&#39;s some stunning cinematography and
startling dream sequences. The costumes, set design, and battle scenes
are as good as anything found in Braveheart. In the end, this is kind
of a feminist Braveheart on acid. And yes, it does run a bit too long,
but the burning at the stake scene at the end is worth the wait, as
wretched as it may be to imagine. Give it a shot. It deserves to be
watched and beheld, if not beloved. 7/10.
