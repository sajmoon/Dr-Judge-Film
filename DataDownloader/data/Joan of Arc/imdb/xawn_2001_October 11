An intelligent interpretation of the life of Joan of Arc. If you are more
of
a 'direct' history story then you would probably not like the film. Gods
apparitions are vague but realistic, battles are chaotic, the hero is
confused. At the end this is more of a philosophical interpretation than
an
adventure. I loved it but i would recommend it to a mature
audience.
