The Messenger was *almost* good. In fact, it was actually quite good, but
Besson's directing, usually superb, totally ruined this
movie.<br /><br />The plot was well done and the visuals were outstanding. However, the
acting
was extremely bad, the casting was very weak, and what really frustrated me
about this movie, and made it *really* hard to sit through, was that every
30 seconds or so, particularly in the beginning of the movie, I noticed
something, either on the forefront or in the background that was just
*wrong*. Generally, little misgivings do not break a movie for me, but
there
were *so* many in this one. A few examples from the beginning of the
movie:<br /><br />A) When the sword is bestowed upon her, and she runs back to her village in
a frenzy, she's holding the sword *by the blade*, in *one hand*. If there
was any sort of sharpness to the sword (which there obviously is, as the
next scene shows the sword running through her mother), it would have
seriously cut her hand, if not chopped a few fingers off.
B) The child who plays Jean speaks flat English, Jovovich speaks with a
French accent.<br /><br />I'm limited to 1000 words, so 2 examples should give you an idea. Little
things like this *abound* in this movie, evidence of bad direction. Now, to
the acting, with the accents the characters used, this movie could have
been
set anywhere, from Jovovich's good French accent, to Malkovich's flat
American words (*can* he do a voice other than his own?), to even some of
the Nordic accents some of the French advisors use.
The plot was good, and enjoyable, but this might be the most pooly directed
film I've ever seen. 3/10
