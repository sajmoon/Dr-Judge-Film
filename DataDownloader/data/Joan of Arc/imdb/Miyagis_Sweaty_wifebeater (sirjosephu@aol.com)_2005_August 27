Joan of Arc (1999) was a Mila Jovovich one woman show. She stars as the
near mythical Joan of Arc. An illiterate teenage peasant girl who
becomes a lighting rod for French independence and the many force of
driving the English interlopers from France. The Hundred Years War has
dragged on a tad longer than a hundred years. France is in a desperate
state of collapsing altogether, the Dauphin (John Malkovich) is in
seclusion in Southern France watching his kingdom erode. He hears about
a young peasant girl (Mila Jovovich) who has says that god wants him to
rule a united France. With nothing to lose, he grants her an audience
and the rest is history....<br /><br />Not to be taken as the final truth. Please remember this is a
historical fiction. If you want to learn more about the real Joan of
Arc I suggest you read up on medieval Europe or just go to your local
library. Co-stars Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman, Vincent Cassel and
Tcheky Kairo. Should have been a French language production. That would
have been cool.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
