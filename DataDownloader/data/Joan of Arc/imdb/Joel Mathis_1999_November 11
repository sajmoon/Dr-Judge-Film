1999_November 11 

This is two and a half hours of my life I want back.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is perhaps the most miscast actress ever.  You can't believe
for a second that her whiny, screeching, obnoxious Joan of Arc can inspire
the French people.  Being forced to spend that much time with a main
character who you can't like at all is a painful experience.<br /><br />The script was horrible, constantly setting up lines that were supposed to
be &quot;inspiring&quot; but instead came across as contrived.  Various characters
changed attitudes off screen leave the audience confused when they showed
up
again speaking a completely different position from the one they were
behind
not more than ten minutes ago.  Instead of explaining why they changed we
are supposed to accept that they did since it moves the story forward.  The
script also constantly had the characters demonstrating political attitudes
far more common to the 1990's than the 1430's leading to some very jarring
situation.<br /><br />I got the impression that this movie was the result of a Hollywood hit
factory where they mix up all the required portions of a sure fire hit and
cynically pass it off to people as entertainment.
