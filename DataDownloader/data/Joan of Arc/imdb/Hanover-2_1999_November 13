A wonderful application of one of the world's most misunderstood enigmas.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich was outstanding in her role as St. Jeanne, a truly
remarkable
performance. Milla's ability to portray Joan's tortured soul was inspiring!
At several points one sees Milla almost go completely insane... as her mind
wrestles with her spirit in a vain attempt to explain what is happening to
her. I was truly moved: inspired, saddened, shocked, revelled!<br /><br />On the down side, I agree with the few critics who have implied some Monty
Python-ish satire / effects during the battle scenes... although the
battles
were for the most part very indicative of period warefare, the catapult
commander, the taunting from the tower and several limb chopping shots
certainly reminds the viewer of Monty Python's Holy Grail... but then again
that's a good thing because without some levity, it would have been
difficult to watch the very dramatic scenes.<br /><br />A movie well worth the name St. Jeanne d'Arc!
