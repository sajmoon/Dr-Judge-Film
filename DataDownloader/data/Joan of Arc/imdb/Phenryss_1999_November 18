1999_November 18 

I was SOOOO looking forward to this, in spite of the director and star. 
Well, they let me down big time.  Luc Besson is all style and no substance. 
Miss Jovovich screamed her way thru 2.5 hours of painful cinema.  She once
again, proved she can not act!!  She was too old, too pretty, and too
passion-less for this powerful role.  Clare Daines, Wynona Rider, or even an
unknown would have had more passion in their eyes than MILLA!!!
Ugh!!
