Luc Besson usually makes spectacular movies; Leon, The Fifth Element, etc.
Joan of Arc is no exception. It details the life of Jeanne, the maiden of
Lorraine, who in and around the year 1431, helped France defeat England, and
win a war that has lasted for almost an entire century. The plot is great,
and it has a very good pace. I am almost never bored when watching this
film, despite the fact that it's fairly long(about two and a half hours
long), and I've seen it at least half a dozen times. What I've found to be
great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has; I've seen it many
times, yet I haven't grown tired of it. Up to the very end, it always has a
scene or two that you can look forward to, either because it's exceptionally
well done, has very good cinematography, has great acting and/or dialog, or
every one of those qualities. The acting is great. Every single actor gives
a great performance, even the child actors were convincing. The performances
that impressed me the most, however, were those of Milla Jovovich and Dustin
Hoffman, as Jeanne and her conscience, respectively. They never cease to
amaze me. The characters were well-written and credible. I particularly
liked the way Jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being
very decisive. I also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters,
the best being La Hire and The Conscience. I liked the way the film seems to
question Jeanne's sanity; whereas most believe that she *was* in fact, sent
by God, this film sits down and asks the question, if she really was, or if
the signs and miracles weren't all in her head, and caused by everyone
wanting to believe it. The very last scenes especially puts doubt in the
viewer. It was quite a gutsy move by Besson, to question his own country's
hero. I will admit, the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy
rather than sent by God, but it doesn't feel like Besson is pushing his view
onto us, telling us that that's the way it was; it feels more like he tries
to make us question it. The action and the war scenes were very well done,
very chaotic and disturbing, very intense and bloody. This isn't the best
war movie ever made, nor is it the most factually accurate; it might not
even be the best retelling of the legend of Jeanne d'Arc. But I have found
it to be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-choreographed, well-done
film that makes you think. And that's good enough for me. Several scenes are
quite memorable, as are some of the lines. All in all, a very enjoyable
war-drama, with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences. I
recommend it to fans of the actors, of Luc Besson's other work and of war
movies/dramas in general. Just don't expect a full-out war movie; it's two
hours and thirty minutes long, and I don't think more than forty-five
minutes in total are spent fighting. 7/10
