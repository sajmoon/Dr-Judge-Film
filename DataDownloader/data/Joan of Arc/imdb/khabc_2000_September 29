Respected readers ,,<br /><br />When I saw &quot;Joan of Arc: the Messenger&quot;, the thing
that moved me most was its closeness to reality. I think that every person
who wishes for &quot;peace around the world&quot; should watch this movie  .   I
liked
the conversation between joan and god(during the end ) very much.   I
think
that joan had the right approach. She always asked for peace before any
war
began.  Its because of people like Joan that people around the world are
enjoying freedom.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has done justice  to the role.  She certainly deserved an
oscar for this performance.  Unfortunately, these days,the judges(for
oscar
awards)  are not choosing the winner  properly.  But i for one , will
remember this performance for ever. Keep it up Milla.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that this movie inspires everybody to look at life in the
right perspective.<br /><br />Hats off to Joan of Arc.<br /><br />
