Milla Jovovich is a very beautiful woman. She has had some success in the
past playing beautiful but rather zany, one dimensional characters (ie. &quot;The
Fifth Element&quot;). Unfortunately, in &quot;The Messenger&quot; she is asked to play a
very complex, multi-dimensional character: Joan of Arc. She simply is not up
to the task.<br /><br />Yes, Milla certainly shows the &quot;insane&quot; side of Joan. And there are many,
many shots of Joan acting nuts. But where are the other sides of Joan?
Where, for instance, is the messenger from God that the title promises? No
divine presence here. Just Joan acting goofy.<br /><br />And as Joan goes, so goes the movie. Yes, you will see some good battle
scenes, and Dustin Hoffman is quite good in his role. Unfortunately, by the
time Hoffman arrives, this picture is already dead in the water. Once Joan
is captured there is no suspense, no mystery left. We simply sit there
yawning and waiting for the bonfire to be lit.<br /><br />However, there is one piece of good news for movie-goers to take with them
from a viewing of &quot;The Messenger.&quot; Obviously the ultimate Joan of Arc movie
has not yet been made. Maybe we'll have better luck next time.
