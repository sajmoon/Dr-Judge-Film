First off, I have to say that I am, by no means, any kind of history expert
or history buff in any way, I know very little about the true Joan of Arc. 
With that said, I shall continue with the review.<br /><br />I thought &quot;Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; was pretty good.  I wouldn't
say it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it was worth my time. 
I thought the story was fairly interesting, a bit odd, and I have no idea
how much of it is true, but it was interesting nonetheless.  As I said I
have no idea how much of this is actually historically accurate, but if this
is true to the real Joan of Arc, then I've got to say, that woman was
INSANE!  The way Milla Jovovich portrayed her was just crazy!  She was one
insane, blood-thirsty woman!  Also, I think it's funny that she is revered
as such a great hero/warrior when (according to the film) she really didn't
do much other than lead the army to battle and run around with her
banner/sword.  Very strange.<br /><br />The actors all seemed to do a pretty good job.  I'm not a huge fan of Milla
Jovovich, she's ok I guess, but she seems to over-act way too much.  John
Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, Tcheky Karyo, Vincent Cassel, Faye Dunaway and
the rest of the cast did a fine job with their roles.  I don't know why
though, but I'm not much of a fan of Faye Dunaway either.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a good movie, very graphic and quite bizarre at
times, but still pretty good.  I hope that you like the film.  Thanks for
reading,<br /><br />-Chris
