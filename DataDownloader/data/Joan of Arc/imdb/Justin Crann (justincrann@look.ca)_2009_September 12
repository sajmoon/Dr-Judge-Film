From director Luc Besson (THE TRANSPORTER, THE FIFTH ELEMENT), who also
co-writes, comes the 1999 historical drama film THE MESSENGER: THE
STORY OF JOAN OF ARC, a film which by and large follows in the
tradition of other stalwarts in the genre (such as BRAVEHEART.) As the
title may suggest, this movie is all about Jeanne D&#x27;Arc, the peasant
girl who would later claim to have seen visions from God and lead the
armies of France to several triumphs over the English during the
Hundred Years War.<br /><br />The film is impressive. Even if it is not perfectly accurate in a
historical sense, it does outline the highlights of Joan&#x27;s campaign,
the prominent figures who fought with and against her, and works
wonders in capturing the sheer brutality of battle.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich (RESIDENT EVIL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT) is wonderful as the
violent, aggressive, and zealous titular character, with her hatred for
the English and desire to do God&#x27;s will made plain on every shot of her
face in battle.<br /><br />Strong supporting turns from John Malkovich (BURN AFTER READING, BEING
JOHN MALKOVICH), Dustin Hoffman (SLEEPERS, RAIN MAN), Tch&#xE9;ky Karyo (THE
PATRIOT, GOLDENEYE), and Vincent Cassel (EASTERN PROMISES, OCEAN&#x27;S
TWELVE) round out the film&#x27;s acting retinue.<br /><br />The battle sequences are brilliantly and brutally shot, specifically
designed to do away with the glorification of war that is so frequently
seen in movies such as this; men are decapitated, blood sprays, heads
are smashed to a pulp. The savagery of 15th-century warfare is brought
to the fore effectively and honestly.<br /><br />But the post-capture sequences are equally entertaining, and this is
largely because of Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s spectacular turn as &#x27;the
Conscience&#x27;. In many ways, Hoffman carries the second act of THE
MESSENGER, and his rendering should have been Oscar-worthy.<br /><br />About the only place the film really suffers is in small areas of
scripting. There are times when characters say silly, or outright
stupid, lines. This is especially true in the moments leading in to
battle.<br /><br />All in all, the movie was entertaining, and worth buying for anyone who
wants to expand their library.<br /><br />7/10.
