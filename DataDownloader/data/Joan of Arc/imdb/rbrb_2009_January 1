What a terrific performance from the lead female, bursting with faith
and power; worth a look for that alone. And magnificent battle scenes
and costumes is another highlight of this movie. The story is about the
real life Joan of Arc who whilst still a teen and hearing voices from
God went about saving medieval France from the clutches of the invading
English,but then again politic are politics....<br /><br />However:<br /><br />On the negative side many of the actors are very English and are meant
to be French so that causes a bit of a problem as the whole film is in
English;plus give certain actors costumes and frills and they &quot;camp&quot; it
up no end, and at times this picture is almost Pantomine stuff.<br /><br />And the worst of it is that Dustin Hoffmann plays some spook meant to
be the conscience or Devil in Joan and he nearly ruins the film with
his conceited &quot;hey-look-at-me-what a star-I am&quot;. Well Dustin I got a
message for you and it don&#39;t come from above: You very nearly destroy
this film and you ought to stick to the likes of being Mrs Robinsons&#39;
Toy Boy as you are out of your depth in this one despite you believing
otherwise.<br /><br />Hence I have taken two votes off for the appalling Dustin and my vote
is:<br /><br />6/10
