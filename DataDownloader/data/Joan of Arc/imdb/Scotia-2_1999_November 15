1999_November 15 

This film is the extraordinary life of Joan of Arc. It deeply goes into her
early preoccupation with God and the obsession with what God wants her to
do. But isn't this really what we all strive for?  What is God's plan for
me?  Her incredible struggle carries us through remarkable scenes which at
times are too bloody or have
too much gore, but this was what happened. I particularly liked the
character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, or was it just Joan's ego??? This
film will gain supporters as more and more people realize its
significance.
