1999_November 24 

I'm a fan of all Besson's films (from The Big Blue to the Fifth Element)
and
his last one is probably one of the best. One of the best thing in this
film
is that Besson succeeded to do an excellent history's film with both
action
and realism (I've re-read the real history of Joan of Arc, and it's
wonderful to see that Besson has use a lot of facts thats really
happened).
