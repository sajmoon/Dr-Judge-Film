The Messenger, The Story of Joan of Arc, is a historical epic full of
vibrant, fleeting images that interpret the emotional origin, thoughts,
and
possible decent into madness of a historical figure normally bound within
the confines of religious myth.
The film, directed by Luc Besson, masterfully examines the psyche of Joan,
portraying her as human rather than a cliche heroine.  It is evident that
Besson thrives on portraying this time in France's history to be as
accurate
and as brutal as historians agree it would have been.  Many of the images
are bloody and raw, however; they are never unimaginative.  The symbolism,
although at times obvious, is never less than pleasing to the eye.  The
photography and composition always carefully constructed as to please even
novice audiences.
If the film has flaws, it comes mostly from the script.  Co-written by
Besson himself, it has strengths while examining Joan, but weakens
considerably when dealing with minor characters such as the the
Dauphin/King, his mother-in-law, and most importantly Joan's comrades in
arms.  This makes the transition from hostile soldiers to devout believers
too fast to completely accept.
The most intriguing/compelling point in the script comes when Dustin
Hoffman's character (termed &quot;conscience&quot; by many)enters.  Wearing the
masks
of innocence, divinity, and death, this &quot;angel&quot; of Joan's own creation
does
not weaken the film, but rather; does what thought-provoking scenes
should-
raise more questions than they answer.  Milla puts on a stunning
performance
if you view her as a young woman teetering on the edge of madness.  If
you're looking for a heroine that never bruises and never questions her
mission, this may not be the film for you.  Overall a 9 rating from this
film-lover.
