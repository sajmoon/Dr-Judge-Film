What a shame.  Great cinematography, wonderful sets and costumes, great
action sequences and a strong, enjoyable supporting cast.  So what went
wrong?
Milla Jovovich was totally unbelievable as Joan.  Her portrayal of the
famous French saint was so grating, so annoying, that I breathed a sigh of
relief when they finally finished her.  Her character was so over-the-top
that she nearly dragged down the wonderful performances of John Malkovich,
Faye Dunnaway and Tcheky Karyo.
I couldn't wait for it to end.
