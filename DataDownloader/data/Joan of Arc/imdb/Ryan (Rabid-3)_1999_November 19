1999_November 19 

A story about a young maiden troubled by visions beautifully portrayed by
Jovovich.  The cinematograpy was wonderfully carried out.  I feel that
critics are just on a bandwagon with this one.  There really is nothing in
the movie that deserves such staunch pessimism.  I feel that a majority of
the critics were expecting war movie and are now viewing the finished
product through Braveheart glasses.  The script is strong.  The actors are
all powerful, with strong presence.  Amazing voice work by all of the
actors.  The battle scenes are well edited, nice and gory in places, but
not
too much.  The filth and mire of the 1400s is really evident in the movie,
and the story does remain very accurate in regards to appearance and
warfare.<br /><br />If you choose to see this movie, which I recommend you do, view it with an
open mind.  Do not go in seeking a hack and slash war movie.  It is much
deeper than that.
