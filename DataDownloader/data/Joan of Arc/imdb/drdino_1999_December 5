1999_December 5 

When our entire high school went to see Ingrid Bergman's Joan of Arc, we
were led to believe that the film told the story as it really happened.
Now, students might believe the same about The Messenger.  Too bad.  This
is
an awful film, much shouting about nothing and poorly directed.  No wonder
Dustin Hoffman is hidden in the shadows and Faye Dunnaway smirks the
entire
time.
