I didn&#x27;t really enjoy seeing a movie with a lot of fighting. That&#x27;s
just not what I&#x27;m looking for. The Leelee Sobieski miniseries was more
my taste, and I really liked her in it.<br /><br />Jane Valentine did an impressive job as the young Jeanne and I was
hoping for a family movie, but those first few minutes, while
entertaining and even humorous, weren&#x27;t typical of what this movie had
to offer.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich did a good job when she was frightened, and this may
have been how this Joan of Arc was supposed to be. Because she kept
seeing visions of a bearded man who was always disappointed in her
efforts, even though she seemed to be doing everything God had asked
her to, and she even accomplished some great things. But one thing
about Jovovich stood out to me: when she was angry, she seemed more
like a spoiled child than one of the greatest women of history.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman stood out more than anyone else, as that bearded man who
seemed to appear only to Joan and did nothing but criticize. I didn&#x27;t
recognize him at first, but later even with the hood I realized I knew
that face. And as always he impressed.<br /><br />There was humor occasionally--how could there not be? This young girl
thinks she can tell these tough men what to do in that day and age. But
this was a historical film about a time of war and it&#x27;s pretty much
what one might expect. Not my taste, but it will certainly be good to
someone.
