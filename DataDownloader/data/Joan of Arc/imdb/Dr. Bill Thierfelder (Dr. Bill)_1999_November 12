1999_November 12 

I've just come back from seeing Luc Besson's brilliant version of the Joan
of Arc legend.  I can't imagine what movie the poison-tongued critics
saw--they lambasted a film that superbly captures the intricate nuances of
Joan's story.  This historically correct film presents Joan as a young
woman
who may or may not be hearing the Voice of God.  Besson analyzes that thin
line between madness and true spiritual insight in a way that allows the
viewers to make up their own minds.  Clearly what Besson wants us to see is
that whether Joan is mad or not is irrelevant compared to the shafting she
got from her King and the Church.  Wonderfully filmed with outstanding
performances, I praise this effort.  And I question how thoughtful critics
whom I once admired could tear this film to shreds the way they have, one,
for example, likening the film to a Monty Python movie.  That's
irresponsible and ignorant critiquing.  See the film for yourself and be
absorbed by this remarkable portrait of a woman misjudged and used by
everyone.
