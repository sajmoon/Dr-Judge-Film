1999_November 27 

I cannot fathom some of the glowing reviews this film is receiving.  I
really, really, REALLY didn't like this movie at all.
Don't get me wrong, I've always found Joan of Arc to be a fascinating
historical figure.  But why on earth did she have to be portrayed like
someone on *****?  More than anything, I'm just disappointed at this film
for the way it was made.  I feel that there was so much more that could
have
been done, but the lousy dialogue and poor directing just made seeing this
film a bad experience.
