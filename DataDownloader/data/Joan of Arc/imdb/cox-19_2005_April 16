This is one of my favorite films. I believe that it portrays an
excellent version of the story of Joan of arch. I feel the
actors/actresses did an wonderful job displaying raw human emotion. I
give this movie two thumbs way up. I loved the music in this film as
well, and actually went out and bought the soundtrack. I also love the
main actress. I own The fifth element, Resident Evil 1&amp;2, Dummy, and
The Messenger. I also liked the sound track to the fifth element so
much I also purchased it as well. When she cut her hair in the movie I
was so moved, I felt it was a great symbol of emotional strength and
tied in with the level of involvement that she had with her soldiers.
It was just GREAT.
