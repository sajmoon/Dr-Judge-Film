I cannot believe that so many of the user comments on this film have totally
missed it's point. Luc Besson's film is not meant to be historically
accurate, and he didn't set out to make a documentary. He set out to make an
interpretation of the myths surrounding a period in medieval history which
is poorly documented, and poorly understood to this day; and he did an
excellent job in doing so.<br /><br />Anyone who knows Besson's films should know that he has a unique and
possibly brilliant imagination. Imagery and fantasy are a mainstay in all
his films, and one either lives with it or avoids them completely. And he
has never cosied up to Hollywood and its blatant commerciality either. He
came close with the Fifth Element in using Bruce Willis and Chris Tucker,
but he made them do it his way, make no mistake.<br /><br />Directors and film-makers need to be allowed their artistic license, or
personal touch. Hollywood and its disciples may not like it this way, but
wouldn't we rather watch films made by creative people rather than
accountants and men in suits?
