The thing that bothered me most about this film, that could've ended up
much
better, were the historical inaccuracies. This movie would have been higher
on my list if they had been more accurate with this.<br /><br />The visual effects, however, were impressive. The war scenes were gruesome
and realistic in this sense. These parts of the movie kept it interesting
and exciting...for a time.<br /><br />It had its clear faults and could have ended up as a masterpiece, had
greater effort been put into it, for the writing and historical research.
But from my view, the good outnumbered the bad in this film, and I voted a
rating of 7/10 for it. I recommend this movie, but not to a high extent.
Overall, &quot;The Messenger&quot; impressed me little.
