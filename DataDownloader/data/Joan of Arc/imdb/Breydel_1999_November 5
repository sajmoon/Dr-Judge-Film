This movie has it all.  Very good acting by the entire crew and a
breathtaking performance by Milla Jovovitch.  The storyline is great and
based on true historical facts.  Decors are very well rebuilt and the
costumes look great.  The main ingredients (religion, battles and justice)
go hand in hand and fit perfectly together.  A must-see movie for all
ages.
