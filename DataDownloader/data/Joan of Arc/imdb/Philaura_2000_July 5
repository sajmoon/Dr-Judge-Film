In this version Joan is portrayed as a crazed, egomaniac bent on revenge
that has rationalized her thirst for blood by designating herself as God's
messenger. Those around her are hopeful that she can save them at best. 
Mostly they try to calm and direct her infuriated rages.  Finally, a danger
to society, she is eliminated by being delivered into the hands of her enemy
as she insists on continuing to fight regardless of the French refusal to
support it any longer.<br /><br />First this isn't the story of St. Joan of Arc as it was told to me as a
child - though possibly a more realistic version of history.  But between
Joan's embellished weird visions, her mad tantrums and the misery she causes
everyone, this movie leaves no room for question as to whether or not she
may have actually been on a mission for God. As a viewer, I became one of
the group that fervently believed she needed to be burned at the stake to
save herself and everyone else as she obviously was a dangerous
nut.<br /><br />I would have prefered if the story would have been left more open to
possiblities rather than having taken such a violent stance against one of
history's strongest females.  Perhaps she could have been a bit more
likeable and less of a hateful lunatic.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film.
