This movie is the BEST historic representation of medieval<br /><br />Europe. It is Violent and breathtaking. I cannot recommend this<br /><br />movie highly enough. But I will try.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is breathtaking. Her portrayal of a historical figure is<br /><br />nuanced in ways that I have not seen before. She strattles the line<br /><br />of devinley influenced messenger of god to crazy lady who hears<br /><br />voices. <br /><br />John Malkovich is...well, John Malkovich. He is subtle and nervous.<br /><br />He is a troubled dauphan and an overly paranoid King. Not his<br /><br />best work ever, but definitely solid.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman, to me, is only good in certain roles. This role, is<br /><br />my favorite of all he's done. It is solid and understated when any<br /><br />other actor would probably try to be loud and boisterous with it.<br /><br />Incredibly amazing in how he give his character life in so few<br /><br />words of dialogue.<br /><br />Luc Besson is one of the greatest directors of out time.  The fact<br /><br />he can do something like the fifth element so well, which is so<br /><br />steeped in science fiction/fantasy , and something like this which<br /><br />is one is forced to follow the guidelines of history, just proves what<br /><br />a versatille and amazing director, He is.<br /><br />Finally the fight scenes. A lot of people feel the need to draw<br /><br />comparisons between this movies and Braveheart because they<br /><br />both deal with medieval fights against the English.  I say this<br /><br />movie is much more than the struggle to overcome the British, it is<br /><br />also the struggle to honor one's god. But also the fights scenes in<br /><br />this movie were much more graphic and violent  and dirty than<br /><br />anything in Braveheart. which I believe is more to the credit of Luc<br /><br />Besson than the detriment of  Mel Gibson.<br /><br />My rating
10/10 amazing simply amazing
