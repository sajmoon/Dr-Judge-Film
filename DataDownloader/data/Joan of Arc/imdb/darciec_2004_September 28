My favorite character was Pascal Greggory's performance as the Duke of
Alen&ccedil;on. He brings such an energy to the role, helping highlight the
stressed-out intensity of Joan and the smirky smarminess of the
Dauphin/King. He made me want to ride into battle alongside him. To
arms! To arms! <br /><br />Highlander fans may also recognize Richard Ridings (La Hire) as one of
Highlander's Four Horsemen (Silas).<br /><br />I read that the American test audiences for this movie 1.) didn't want
Joan to be burned at the end and suggested a re-write where she lives,
and 2.) weren't sure where the movie was taking place. Has education
really gone that far down the tubes in this country?<br /><br />.
