1999_December 5 

I really liked this movie.  Visually it was like every other besson movie:
stunning.  The movie was very much like Scorcese's &quot;Last Temptation&quot; in
that
it was the study of greater than life character that did not choose to
treat
the person as someone that was untouchable and on a pedestal.  Instead it
showed Joan (Jean en Francais?) as a everdyay person with human emotions
who
tried to do the best with the extraordinary situation she was in.
