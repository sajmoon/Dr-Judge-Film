1999_November 8 

I really liked the fact that Besson, for once, concentrated on having the
facts rights rather than just doing pyrotechnics. I mean, we are shown it
was all about politics. Jeanne d'Arc (her real name) would have been a tool
for Yolande of Aragon (Charles VII's mother in law). We are also shown
Jeanne as a real war leader and understand how and why soldiers from both
sides either followed or feared her, thinking she may have some magical
powers. We also see Milla Jovovitch shouting, shouting and shouting - like
the real Jeanne d'Arc.<br /><br />On the other hand, the war between the progressive Burgundy (allied to
England's regent) and the Armagnacs (Charles VII's party) is only painted in
the background. The fact that you had two popes at the time (one in Avignon,
another in Roma) is not told.<br /><br />But the political setting is, overall, correct. So I understand it may be a
little bit complicated for an US audience. I really thought that the fact
Luc Besson also recreated real battles and the real butchery of a medieval
battle, would appeal to a large public (not because the bloodshed is
historically correct, but because, let's face it, we like violence).<br /><br />I think the movie should have been targeted at a more mature audience - most
US fans of Monsieur Besson will be disappointed. Maybe we need more culture
to really enjoy this kind of movie.
