1999_October 28 

I've seen this film in a preview in belgium. I expected another Braveheart
epic storry but NO WAY . For a 2h30 min film its too slow, its all about
catholocism, the battles are cool but too short. And the way they try to
re-capture Paris made me laugh.
Everybody knows the end, no twists in the plot. Have faith
:p
