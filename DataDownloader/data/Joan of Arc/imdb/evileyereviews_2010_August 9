For those of you that want the most accurate history of Joan of Arc (or
any other figure) then go read a book. For the rest of us that enjoy
movie based on historical interpretations, then this wonderful flick by
Luc Besson will be sure to entertain. Instead of pigeon-holing us into
his version of the truth, Luc instead asks more questions than he
answers, and then leaves the viewer to ponder them. And he does this
with a wonderfully constructed movie that is brutal, at times humorous,
and always stylish. Milla Jovovich&#x27;s performance elicits a character
whose insufferable drive to do God&#x27;s work teeters on the brink of
sanity, just as she should be. Her supporting cast is just as solid,
with Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, and Tcheky Karyo
just to name a few. The cast here is used to create an army of good,
bad, and mostly in between characters. Even the clergy is portrayed
without overtly vilifying them. The script was solid, the direction
great. The camera work work did wonders to capture the discomfiting
sense of Joan&#x27;s visions. Overall, this rather long movie ended too soon
for these secular eyes. Late.<br /><br />Evil Eye Reviews
