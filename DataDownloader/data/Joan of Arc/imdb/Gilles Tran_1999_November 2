This is surely a stunning movie. Like all Besson's movies, it suffers from
plot holes and a lack of stylistic balance. The very beginning is cheesy
(looks like a shampoo commercial), the ending so-so when compared to the
rest of the movie. And yet, it's stunning. The battle scenes of course
(think Saving Private Ryan + Braveheart), but not only that. The key is
Milla Jovovitch, who has everything one could expect from Joan, and more. If
you can't figure out how a 18-year old peasant maiden could lean men to war,
just watch Milla take charge, of her warriors, and of the movie. Mel
Gibson's William Wallace was good, but this was another cool Mel character.
Here, you've got a hero who's truly frightening, the embodiment of
willpower. She's a righteous, religious war machine trapped in a young
girl's body, and sometimes a young girl trapped in an armor suit, up to the
point of utter craziness. Is Joan a saint ? The movie has an original,
modern answer, far from the kiddie legend we all know. Milla's Joan is close
to some of Shakespeare's heroes or heroines, mad but not quite, sure of her
destiny and assailed by doubts. In spite of its flaws, one the most
compelling movies of the year, with Milla Jovovitch as the most credible
Joan ever.
