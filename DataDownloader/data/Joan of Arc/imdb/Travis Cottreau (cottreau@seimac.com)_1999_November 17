1999_November 17 

I loved this movie. It's visually stunning and the casting and acting was
superb. The story was already layed out (approximately), so Luc Besson
concentrated on Jeanne herself, the person and what she was like and why she
did what she did.<br /><br />I have to admit to putting myself in Jeanne's place, feeling what she must
have been feeling along the way. I think without that, it probably would
have been a much duller movie, although probably entertaining.<br /><br />The battles scenes, of which there were many, were graphic and brutal.
Dismemberments, swords and maces swinging, lots of pain and death. The
ensuing desolation at the end of a battle were weighty and gave a a horrible
look at the conditions of the time.<br /><br />My final impressions... Joan of Arc, if the portrayals were accurate was a
driven young woman, deeply religious and deeply confused who was probably at
least partially insane. If she were alive today, no doubt, she would be
treated with common drugs and would lead a normal life. I felt very sorry
for her and her situation and for the way that she was treated. I know
people would argue that there is no need to feel this way, because she was
clear and sure of her purpose. I don't feel that this was ever the case and
she was sure only that she was going crazy if she didn't do something.<br /><br />Movies don't usually move me this way and I'm really amazed.<br /><br />
