I found Luc Besson&#39;s take on the story of Joan of Arc thoroughly
compelling. Like all of Besson&#39;s films, The Messenger is highly
stylized, nicely cast, and visually powerful. The film is also
forgivably anachronistic in terms of language while developing a strong
period feel through sets and costume. <br /><br />Joan was, of course, the deeply religious teenage girl who lead Prince
Charles&#39; army to improbable victory over the invading English at
Orleans and helped re-consolidate French sovereignty. Joan considered
herself God&#39;s appointed messenger, and France apparently saw her as an
avenging angel. Today, she is commonly regarded as a schizophrenic. She
was canonized in the 1950s, 500 years after her death. Regardless of
whether God or insanity was the source of her strength, power, will and
incredible courage - there is little ambiguity about her role in the
salvation of France nor the fate that awaited her afterward. <br /><br />In general, the acting is quite good. Jovovich&#39;s much-maligned
performance is actually very good and exactly appropriate for what
Besson was trying to do with the film. Comparing Joan of Arc to her
other Messianic role as Leelu in the Fifth Element is, frankly,
ridiculous. I believe that the problems people find in Jovovich&#39;s
performance are problems those same people bring to the film. Malkovich
and Dunaway are phenomenal. Tcheky Karyo and Vincent Cassell provide
excellent support. <br /><br />Besson strays from what we think we know about the details of Joan&#39;s
story, but only to present the truth of the big-picture more
accurately. His film steadfastly refuses to answer the questions many
people will bring to it: <br /><br />* Was Joan schizophrenic? * Was she a catholic messiah or divinely
inspired prophet?<br /><br />Why is Besson so careful about accurately presenting the ambiguity of
the story? I think he wanted to make a moving film, but not a film
which would unsubtly challenge its audience&#39;s beliefs. If you do not
believe, you will tend to explain Dustin Hoffman&#39;s character as a
manifestation of Joan&#39;s psychological problems. If you do believe, you
may want to think of him as Satan, am angel, perhaps both. Thus,
Besson, who is a deeply spiritual person, makes a powerful statement
about faith through his metanarrative while maintaining an
appropriately unevangelical position. He took similar paths in his more
uplifting films The Fifth Element and Angel-A.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Besson and Jovovich fans. Not a biography -
avoid this if you must have the &quot;plain&quot; facts! Mildly recommended as a
piece of historical fiction.
