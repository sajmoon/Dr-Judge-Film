As much as I've enjoyed his previous films, Jeanne D'Arc turned out to be
a
big disappointment... As you already know if you've seen one of Besson's
previous movies - they're always visually breathtaking. This was no
exception. However - I now realize why Milla Jovovich was talking
&quot;martian&quot;
in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. She's really not a good actor. The most remarkable
thing about her performance was her change of hair style through the
movie -
I guess that says it all...<br /><br />To sum it up: 10/10 for the visuals and sound. Acting 3/10...
