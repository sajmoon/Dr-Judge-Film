Clearly a Besson movie (compare it to Le Grand Bleu and
L&eacute;on).<br /><br />The camerawork is beautiful and adds very well to the drama. Dialogs are
well balanced and strong. A great peace of cinema that grabs you and you
don't realize it takes 2.5 hours. The only drawback I could find is that
the
French actually should have spoken French.<br /><br />I regret I haven't seen it at home and not in a cinema theater, which
would
have been even better. Not a masterpiece, but pretty close to
it...
