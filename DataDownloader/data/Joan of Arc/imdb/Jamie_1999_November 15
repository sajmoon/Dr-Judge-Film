1999_November 15 

The story of Joan of Arc is fascinating enough so I can't understand
why the producers of The Messenger insisted on rewriting history. The
distasteful and utterly repulsive rape scene at the beginning of the film
was developed by the sick mind of the producers and director-there is no
documentation anywhere stating that this action took place. Even if it
had,
however, the idea of rape is vile in itself-there was no need for this
scene
to be shot in the manner it was. Unfortunately, the film is obviously
aimed
at the MTV generation (I, being 17, am a part of this generation and
recognize that not all of America's youth is brainless and shallow, but
many
are)and the &quot;less is more&quot; approach does not satisfy their unimaginative
minds. The rest of the film is like watching a horrendously long episode
of
Xena:Warrior Princess. The actors speak in modern day slang and the use of
the f-word acted as the movie's comic relief. Speaking of comic relief, I
could not help but notice how much the decapitations and dismemberments
resembled the scene with the black knight in Monty Python and the Hole
Grail. The actress portraying Joan was too squeaky-voiced and fussy to be
a
convincing Maiden of Orleans. Music can be the most effective part of a
movie. Such is not the case for the Messenger. The movie's score was much
too overpowering.
I didn't actually think that they movie was horrible, it just wasn't
that great.
