<br /><br />	The Messanger, in my opinion, is a very unique and well made historical
piece (despite how inaccurate it might be). Milla Jovovich plays Joan as a
very ignorent and quite annoying women as I would imagine her to be. What I
hated about the film is that I walked away confused and rather un happy
about the ending. The movie made me detest religeon even more because it
seemed so corrupt, confusing and primitive. Dustin Hoffmans character was
very interesting but I felt it left me to torn in the end.
