2000_September 29 

I see this film as an attempt to investigate the psychology of myth,
heroism, and miracles.  The task is as formidable as the subject matter,
but
I think the director and his cast largely are able to pull it off.  This is
the preferred film for a serious &quot;student&quot; of Joan de Arc (who happens to
be
an ancestor of mine).  And The Messenger is entertaining as
well.
