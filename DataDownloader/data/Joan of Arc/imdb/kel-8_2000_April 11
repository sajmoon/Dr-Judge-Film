2000_April 11 

I must confess, I went into this movie REALLY wanting to like it.  I had
heard bad reviews, but thought, 'hey, I don't always agree with critics...'
Anyway, I was deeply disappointed.  I was left wondering whether the
filmmaker or cast wanted us to believe Jeanne, or if they wanted us to
think
she was a lunatic.  Milla played Jeanne as furtive, flighty and explosive.
Dustin Hoffman's character came out of nowhere without explanation.  John
Malkovich, one of my favorite actors, played an empty, shallow character,
and disappeared from the story near the end without a resolution for his
character.  One might argue that the Dauphin was shallow, but I mean the
character was one-dimensional.  Also, the movie was excessively gory.  I
was
ready for an epic, and instead saw a weak film that left me with more
questions than answers or entertainment.
