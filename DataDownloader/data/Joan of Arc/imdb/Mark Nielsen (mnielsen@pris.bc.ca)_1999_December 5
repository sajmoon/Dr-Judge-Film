Considering it took 500 years from her death before she was canonized, it's
not surprising that Hollywood had not come out with a major feature-length
film about Joan of Arc until now.<br /><br />But like that Columbus craze that came upon us back in 1992, Hollywood is
taking on her story with a vengeance. Along with a recently-aired
television
mini-series, there are two movies about the legendary French femme
fatale.<br /><br />And one of them, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, is
out.<br /><br />Action-adventure director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) takes on the
project, with his wife, Milla Jovovich, playing the lead role. And that's
just the beginning of the controversy.<br /><br />It seems that in a desperate need to find the `motivation' necessary for
Joan to take on English single-handed, Besson conjures up a fictitious
scene
in which an English soldier skewers Joan's sister with a sword and then
rapes her.<br /><br />And so, with one ghastly swoop, Besson finds an easy way out. Rather than
tackling straight on one of the most complex and puzzling figures in the
history of western civilization, Besson
reduces the whole tantalizing and troubling tale into a revenge flick about
a comic book character.<br /><br />(Matters aren't helped by the fact that he can't even get Joan's
hallucinations right. Rather than having her converse with St. Margaret,
St.
Catherine, and St. Michael, as she claimed to do back in the 1400s, Besson
cuts out the middlemen and has her connected directly to Jesus
Christ.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, while Bresson takes some serious shortcuts with the script, he
makes no compromises when it comes to the visuals. Essentially
two-and-a-half hours of  highly graphic and
gory battle scenes, interspersed
with surreal visions The Messenger is finely crafted and well-paced, albeit
full of medieval mud, blood and
dismemberment.<br /><br />While Jovovich may not necessarily have earned the right to play the role,
she does an admirable although sometimes over-the-top take on the
hyper-energetic Joan. While many of us will dispute her one-on-one
relationship with The Big Guy (or is it Gal?), there's no doubt from this
movie that she has a God-given talent for breaching drawbridges.<br /><br />In fact, maybe this movie could have been called `A Drawbridge Too Far',
for
Joan is so overly-ambitious that the very king she's fighting is scared
into
betraying her. A glass-is-half-full kind of guy, the war-weary Charles VII
is happy simply to have his crown and half of France.<br /><br />Unable to give her the army she needs to storm the walls of Paris, Charles
VII, like Besson, resorts to the easy answer and allows the enemy to
capture
Joan. The English, in turn, do their
part by finding a way to frame Joan following a somewhat drawn-out an
ecclesiastical trial, and she meets her legendary and gruesome
demise.<br /><br />Jovovich is backed by some heavyweights. John Malkovich plays Charles VII
and Faye Dunaway plays the king's mother-in-law. And in a serious piece of
miscasting, Dustin Hoffman plays Joan's conscience so flaccidly that he
doesn't even hide the Brooklyn accent.<br /><br />There's no doubt, The Messenger is misguided and rife with flaws. Even as
an
action-adventure, it barely rises above the splatter. But if you must see
this movie, it's worth paying the extra few dollars to see it on the big
screen.
