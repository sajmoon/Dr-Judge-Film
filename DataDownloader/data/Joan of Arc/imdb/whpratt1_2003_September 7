2003_September 7 

                  Anyone interested in history and the military weapons of
war during the reign of Charles VII,( John Malkovich,&quot;Johnny English&quot; 03
will enjoy this picture and the great acting he portrayed as king.  The
entire picture took years to make and the photography was outstanding and
very realistic with blood and guts on the battle fields with armored wearing
human beings slaughtering each other.  Faye Dunaway (Yolande D'Aragone) &quot;The
Calling&quot; '02 performed her role as a very evil advisor to Charles VII.    I
was taken by surprise to see Dustin Hoffman(The Conscience)&quot;Runaway Jury'03&quot;
playing this role, I immediately recognized his voice and was able to see
his face with the long beard.  This film keeps you on the edge of your seat
and great credit must be given to Milla Javovich(Joan of Arc) &quot;You Stupid
Men '02 who had to view horrible abuse as a young girl.   View this film
when you can, you won't be sorry!
