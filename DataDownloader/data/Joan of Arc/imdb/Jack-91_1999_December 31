Some movies would probably try to make a more divine spirit out of Joan but
at least Besson examines all possibilities as regards to what inspired her.
I think it was as honest a film you could make about Joan. Her quest for
revenge combined with tremendous belief in the forces above that ignited
her
fire. Through Dustin Hoffman the viewer can question her motives and get
her
response. And what a performance! Milla was simply breathtaking as
Joan.
