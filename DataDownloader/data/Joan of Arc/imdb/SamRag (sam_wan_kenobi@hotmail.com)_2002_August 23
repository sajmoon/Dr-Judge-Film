I wanted to see this one at the movies, but after hearing it was no good
from what I considered good sources, I decided against it.  Having seen it
at the DVD-rental store many times, often almost grabbing it, but deciding
against it remembering how horrible it was supposed to be.  Finally one day,
finding nothing else, I rented it.  And I loved it!  It is great, finding
jewels unexpectedly like this, as when one watches as many films as I do,
the only great films you see are the newest ones.  After watching it, I went
to the user comment area here on IMDb and tried to find out why people have
given it such low rating.  Further more, this was an Oscar performance from
Milla Jovovich, but apparently the film wasn't even nominated (based on what
I can see here on IMDb).  This film is in the category, `either you get it,
or you don't', or `either you love it or hate it'.  I didn't know anything
about Joan of Arc, and maybe that is why I liked it, watching it as a film
rather then historical documentary.  The film leaves me with a comfortable
feeling.  Before I watched it, I was afraid that we would see some saint of
a woman, and how un-human and holy she was in what she did.  Instead we see
a young woman, plagued with the notion of purpose, extreme determination,
while never fully understanding why or what is happening.  Joan of Arc is
much more of a hero to me after seeing this film, because the film is about
her as a woman, rather then some supernatural being.  
9/10
