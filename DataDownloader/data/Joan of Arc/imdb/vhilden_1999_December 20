1999_December 20 

If you like stereotypes, by all means go see this film. Or if you just
happen to like gore, if you love those severed limbs and heads; it's rather
more graphical in this respect than 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />On the other hand, they could have found a real actress to play Joan; a top
model is nice, but can she act? Not, unless you count the volume of her
voice as a plus. John Malkovich was very good as Charles VII, one got the
distinct impression he was laughing at the director. Dustin Hoffman seemed
rather bored as God, or Satan, or Joan's conscience, or whatever he was
playing. <br /><br />The script was easily done, just get the most fanatically patriotic French
history books, gloss over the details and forget about any sort of
'balanced' point of view. <br /><br />Well, at least they had no lack of catsup... But chrome plating was invented
450 years after the film period. Or were the swords made of stainless steel?
Equally anachronistic, I fear.<br /><br />I give it a four out of ten, there are many other better ways to spend two
and a half hours.
