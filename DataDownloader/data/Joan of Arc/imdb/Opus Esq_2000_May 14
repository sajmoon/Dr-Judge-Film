This movie could have faired better without so much time spent on Jeanne's
(Joan of Arc's) formative years.  Less time and effort should have went
into
the greusome battle scenes  and more time spent on getting the best
possible
performances out of the actors, especially Jeanne(Milla Jovovich) and
Charles VI (John Malkovich).  Did we  really need to see all the various
ways to better kill someone in a movie about a girls faith in God and her
countrymen's willingness to follow her?)<br /><br />All I saw John Malkovich do was whine and carry on like a snivelling child.
Dustin Hoffman's character was not needed, and the director had no clue how
to best show Jeanne's faith and devotion to God appear believable.  Even
the
greatest actors need a good director to bring out the best in them.  So if
anything goes wrong in a movie, it is ultimately the director's fault.
Otherwise, it was a decent movie.<br /><br />Charle's brother and his knights were my favorite characters.  How else do
you act when your brother sends you this seemingly crazy girl, who is
either
recieving Godly vissions or possiblly suffering from halucinations (caused
by brain tumors,maybe?), to lead your troops against the much larger
Brittish army of invaders?<br /><br />I gave it a 6 out of 10, because I liked King Charle's brother and his
elite
guard so much.  (10 being &quot;Godfather&quot; quality, 1 being &quot;Manos, Hands of
Fate&quot; or &quot;Ace Ventura &gt;take your pick, both Ventura movie's sucked&lt;&quot;
bad.)
