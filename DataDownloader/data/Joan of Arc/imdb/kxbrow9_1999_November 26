1999_November 26 

When I was younger, I was entranced by the story of Joan Of Arc: There was
something captivating in the romantic notion of a girl not out of her teens
helping to conclude a century-plus of Medieval conflict with the expulsion
of invaders from her native soil.  As an educated adult, however, the whole
idea began to seem a bit far-fetched; more of a propaganda tale than a
historical fact.  When I heard about Besson's intention of modernizing the
tale along the lines of &quot;Braveheart,&quot; I was all set to be disappointed; the
nationalistic fervor that was that movie's strength would come across
embarrassingly hollow as the more fanciful elements in Joan's tale
accumulated.  To my shock, this film not only failed to disappoint me, it
actually exceeded my expectations by actively confronting the issues behind
the historical account of her rise and fall.  Despite it's violence and
intensity, it actually possesses a subtlety that's bound to be lost on the
majority of it's viewers, critics included.<br /><br />Just as it seems the movie is ready to complete the &quot;Braveheart&quot; mold by
following her triumphant rise to glory with a similar indignant reaction to
its protagonist's betrayal and resultant martyrdom, it takes a sudden
left-turn off the beaten path:   After her victory at Orleans-the high
point
of her &quot;career&quot;-she experiences another vision like those that lead her to
that point, but it is now of a furious Christ, berating her for the
destruction she has wrought in his name.  From there, the movie proceeds in
a refreshingly analytical manner, becoming an examination of the nature of
her religious fervor and its contradictions as the captive Joan is
questioned not only by church officials, but by an even worse
inquisitor-her
own conscience.  Despite this sacrilegious approach, however, the film
doesn't overtly question whether she heard the voice of God or not, but how
she saw fit to perceive it as a call to arms.<br /><br />Milla Jovavich has been berated as having secured the role of the French
heroine based solely on her relationship with Luc Besson; an unfortunate
side issue, because she handles the role brilliantly. Neatly framed by
Besson's intelligent direction, her portrayal is relentlessly human: A
diminished Joan that is more cheerleader than warrior, more zealot than
saint; all the while a mystifying alien to the people around her.  Her
death
on the stake is far and away the loneliest of any portrayal, as her Joan
dies alienated even from her own God.
