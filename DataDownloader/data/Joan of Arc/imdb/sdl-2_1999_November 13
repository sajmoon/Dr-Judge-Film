1999_November 13 

Based on the critical panning of this movie, I didn't go in with high hopes,
so I was delighted to see that the critics were yet again... well, stupid,
and just following each other's lead.  The serenely beautiful Milla Jovovich
seemed nervous and a bit dazed throughout this movie, but by the end managed
to be convincing as Joan.  The rest of the cast was just superb.  But the
most wonderful thing about this underrated film is the unresolved complexity
of Joan's character, as revealed by her visions and her dialogue with her
&quot;Conscience,&quot; played with understated brilliance by Dustin Hoffman.  The
outstanding final moments of The Messenger reminded me of T.S. Eliot's
&quot;Murder in the Cathedral,&quot; which I recommend highly to anyone who enjoyed
this movie and would like to gain further insight into Joan's martyrdom. 
But even atheists will enjoy this beautiful and powerful
film.<br /><br />
