<br /><br />This movie ranks as one of the most disappointing films of all
time.<br /><br />Jovovich's acting was terrible. I grew to dislike her more every minute. The
character she portrays is more psychotic than heroic. She comes across as
someone who would suffer a nervous breakdown over a trip to the grocery
store, not someone who could inspire an army.<br /><br />The script was laughable. I don't understand why they didn't try to use more
period language. I cringed at some of the lines (&quot;Everything will be fine.&quot;)<br /><br />Why stars like Dunaway and Hoffman would appear in this film is beyond
me.<br /><br />
