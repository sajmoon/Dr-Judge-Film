I think Jane Valentine is far better than Milla Jovovich,she is very
pretty and it&#39;s a pity she never went on playing movies,i was just
wandering whether she is British or American and how old might she be
by now,if you know something about her could you please give me some
information just about her age and nationality,in the film she acts in
a so sweet way,i can&#39;t help watching the beginning while she is still a
child,once she grows up everything turns weary,i know Joan of arc
wasn&#39;t so pretty at all,i&#39;m always referring to Jane Valentine because
i&#39;m sorry to disappoint you but Jovovich has not done quite a good job
she is sort of pathetic in my opinion for her ugliness and lack of will
of acting properly.
