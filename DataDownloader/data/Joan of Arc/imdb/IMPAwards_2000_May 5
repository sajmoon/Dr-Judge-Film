You can certainly see a gem of a great film in here. Unfortunately, it is
almost completely obscured by bad acting, over-direction, wretched
dialogue,
and completely nonsensical battles scenes. Jovovich was fine at times, but
impossible to believe in the battle scenes. Far too many of the directorial
touches were obvious and pointless. The movie ended up being more
successful
as a comedy than a serious film. Things only improved towards the end with
the entrance of Hoffman. Otherwise, it was quite the mess.
