1999_November 15 

This movie was an abomination.  Besson's use of dialog was nothing short
of
laughable.  Milla Jovovich delivered an arguably spirited, if not overly
acted performance as the ever-vigilant Joan.  The dialogue was written as
if
it were in constant need of 'Indiana Jones' type humor throughout the
film.
I think a film of this serious and somber tone could easily, and more
believably, done without the ridiculous attempts and comic relief.  Save
your $7.50 to go see American Beauty again.
