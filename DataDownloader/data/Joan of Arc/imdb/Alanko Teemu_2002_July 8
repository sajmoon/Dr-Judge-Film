I was very interested in England and France history, since I saw
BRAVEHEART
(1995). It was an excellent movie and I really enjoyed it. This movie JOAN
OF ARC (1999) was a great bought. I also enjoyed this movie very much
because it has a good actors/actress's. Specially Milla Jovovich and John
Malkovich. The Story was nice and the directing was good. What can I also
expect ? Nothing, but some popcorn.<br /><br />(4,5/5)
