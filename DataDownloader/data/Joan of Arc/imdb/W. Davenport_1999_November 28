1999_November 28 

The concept of the story of the Maid of Lorraine was prime material for a
epic of &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; proportion. Unfortunately it opened on the
heels
of a TV mini-series which may have stolen some of its thunder. The
cinematography was excellent and the battle scenes were as gory as those
in
Saving Private Ryan - probably very much as they actually were. Most of
the
supporting actors were excellent. The &quot;poetic license&quot; that was taken with
the real story took away from the intent of the movie. The &quot;mystical
scenes&quot;
where Joan was hearing voices or getting spiritual revelations were more
like Natural Born Killers meet the Dark Ages. Oliver Stone must have been
consulted on these. The historical inaccuracies were abundant, such at the
disgusting rape of Joan's sister, which she, in actuality, did not have.
We
know little of the appearance of the relevations she had, but I am sure
they
were nothing like depicted - which evidently had some hidden meaning that
the average movie goer will never be able to figure out.<br /><br />The movie was destroyed by the Mila Jovovich as Joan. Most of the scences
with her resembled footage from the Blair Witch Project more than a
portrayal of St. Joan of Arc. She has little acting ability and her
overdone
performance absolutely ruined the movie. I do not feel that someone as
strong as Joan and as religiously committed would have continually been on
the verge of hysteria almost to the point of having a seizure.<br /><br />I still do not know what compelled me to sit through the whole movie. I
have
not seen anything this bad since the early 1980's remake of
1984.<br /><br />Had the movie paid more attention to historical data, de-emphasized those
&quot;speculated&quot; vision scenes, and used a legitimate actress - like Leelee
Sobieski in the TV mini-series - this movie would have been a great
success.<br /><br />This movie portrayed Joan as a confused, hysterical, psychotic. The real
Joan would have never been able to accomplish what she did, even to the
point of being martyred with such spiritual and confident serenity if she
was actually like the movie Joan.<br /><br />Use your bonus rental at your favorite video store rather than pay good
money to see this bit of glitzy trash.
