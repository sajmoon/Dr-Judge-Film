For being a film that is slightly above average, it contains performances
that alone saves this film from being too light on the subject. Milla
Jovovich is simply sensational as Jeanne D'Arc, the savior of Orl&eacute;ans, who
went to war against the English after having received a message from
God.<br /><br />The most exciting part of this film is not the war itself or the intricate
dealings that led to Jeanne D'Arc's demise - but the dialogue between Jeanne
and her own conscience, aptly played by the Man with the Voice, Dustin
Hoffman. Did she really receive a message from God, or was it the need for
revenge that spurred her visions. Did she not enjoy the taste of blood in
battle? Very interesting twist indeed, and that, together with Jovovich's
amazing acting, keeps this film from falling into the average.
