Milla and the ensemble cast take the story of Joan of Arc to another
level.<br /><br />Religious violence tempered with humanity as Joan realizes just what she
has
started with her war against the English king. I was taken in by the
rampaging yet deceptively naive Joan (played by Milla) and went with the
tide (as did the others following Joan) only to find myself alone and
uncomfortable at the denouement.
Luc Besson has shown us both sides of Joan - devout yet vengeful-humane
yet
terrifying.  Congratulations to the cast and crew on a truly satisfying
movie<br /><br />
