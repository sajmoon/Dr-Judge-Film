Besson&#39;s version of the story of Joan of Arc offended me on many
levels. The opening sequences of the movie feature the gruesome murder
and rape (in that order) of Joan&#39;s sister. This was completely
unnecessary and untrue. While it is fact that Joan&#39;s town was raided
several times and on one occasion burned by the English; Joan of Arc
had 2 brothers, but no sisters. This alone was enough to ruin the movie
for me, since Besson proceeds to build a case that all of Joan&#39;s
actions and her descent into insanity were caused by the horrific death
of her sister.<br /><br />Besson also inexplicably created a sinister tormentor for Joan, played
by Dustine Hoffman. Hoffman&#39;s character who continually played the
devil&#39;s advocate to a clearly insane Joan, was just plain annoying,
confusing, and yet another fabrication. Besson&#39;s Joan was never seen
having the visions of St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and St. Michael
which the real Joan of Arc was reported to have. Instead she saw a
twisted and almost demonic Christ figure and the strange Dustin Hoffman
character. For Besson to portray a saint and a French national hero in
such a manner was purely offensive and in poor taste. Had Besson
actually bothered to base his story on historical fact I may have felt
differently. If you see this movie, regard it only as a work of
fiction, for it bears little in common with the real Joan of Arc other
than her name and that she freed Orleans.
