From thrillers, dramas to science fiction Luc Besson has finally proved
the
depth of his talent with this historic masterpiece. Expect excitement,
tears
and laughter as Besson takes the audience into the heart of French history
with both faultless accuracy and realism. Milla Jovovich has taken the
leap
from average to great by her captivating role as Joan of Arc. Along with
strong support from Hoffman , Dunaway and Malkovich the only thing missing
from this film were the academy award nominations.
