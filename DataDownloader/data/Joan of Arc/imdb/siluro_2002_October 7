2002_October 7 

Let's get one thing straight from the beginning: this movie is not
pretending to have historical value - it's Luc Besson's point of view, and
as far as I'm concerned it is the most important one possible. What this
movie IS - so damn good it makes me want a sequel (kind of impossible of
course, though &quot;Joan of Arc II: Reborn In Fire&quot; sounds good to me :-).
What
to expect - it is Besson, so be prepared for the usual perfect mixture of
action, drama, cool FX and that cool piece of humor, which exists even in
the most tragic moments. The movie is great, especially if you abandon the
religious content, and think of Joan more like of an action heroine (great
acting by Milla Jovovich).
