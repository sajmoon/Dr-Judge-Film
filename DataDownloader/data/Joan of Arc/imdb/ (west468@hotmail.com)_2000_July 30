Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. Hoffman's &quot;Conscience&quot;
just
puts it together. Does anyone has a right to kill even for a cause? What is
right or wrong? How are we ever able to know it? Is there God outside or
inside us? This is not a war film. This is a film of people trying to
understand life in their view. How can we say is it right or wrong
view?
I saw this movie in a film theatre and it was really hard to wait until it
came out in video. I bought it right away. I just love all the actors and
actresses, especially Desmond Harrington's Jean d'Aulon. He's one of the
most sympathetic characters I've ever seen in the movies. Milla is also
really great in her role, she just suits it perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this movie and I know I'll watch it over and
over
again.
