1999_November 8 

Everyone probable knows the Jeanne d'Arc story and the fact that Jeanne was
burned at the stake. I myself didn't know what did actually bring her there
but this movie will give you the answer. Perhaps it could have been told in
less time, but still it is a very skillfully told story. Milla Jovovich
plays tremendously passionate. You admire and feel sorry for her at the same
time and the final scenes of the utter distress she is going through left me
very disturbed. If only our worldleaders have the same consciousness as
Jeanne had...
As for all the other actors, they also play very convincingly and Dustin
Hofmann with his great voice! (It made me wonder why he never was casted as
Darth Vader..) but Milla definitely has my votes for the next Globe and
Oscar!
