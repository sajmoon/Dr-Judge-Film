1999_November 21 

This movie blew me away. It was fantastic and powerfull. The opening is
fantastic as we see a young Joan running through a feild, it was shot very
well. The story was great too. One of the best parts is when we first see
the grown-up Joan and she knows that she is being tested. This film is the
best movie since 1997/8'S Life Is Beautiful. It was really dissapointing to
see it open at number 4, it deserves much better
