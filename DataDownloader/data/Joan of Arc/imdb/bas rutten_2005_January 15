Just around the time this movie was made, a miniseries about the same
subject was also made. If you want to find out about Joan of Arc, watch
the miniseries which is vastly superior to this failed attempt to tell
a potentially very interesting story. Whereas the miniseries gave a
very detailed look at the story of Joan of Arc, and took a lot of time
to develop the characters, their backgrounds and their motives, this
movie is a slow and boring mess.<br /><br />Despite its 2.5 hour plus running time, very little happens. We are
shown just a couple of events from Joan's life, and none of the
secondary characters are developed at all. The historical context and
politics are also kept to a minimum. Instead, the movie spends a lot of
time on Joan, and whether she was divinely inspired or just plain
crazy. <br /><br />Granted, that's an interesting issues, and it might have worked if Joan
had either been played by a good actress, or if the dialogs had been
good. Unfortunately,neither of these conditions apply. Milla Jovovich
just doesn't have the acting talent to pull of a convincing
performance. She makes Joan look like an utterly unsympathetic, crazy
and frightened religious fanatic. How somebody like this could have
ever inspired anybody is beyond me, you're much more likely to feel
sorry for her.<br /><br />The dialog and the supporting cast don't help either. Dustin Hoffman
does a fine job, but John Malkovich is totally wasted here, and the
other actors are generally very unconvincing. The dialog is horrible as
well: the parts that are intended seriously are so heavy-handed and
clich&eacute; that they become unintentionally funny, whereas there are also
some light-hearted parts that feel totally inappropriate.<br /><br />Given the directory's experience with action movies, it's surprising
that he doesn't even get the action sequences right. The action is
fairly gory, but it lacks any kind of tension or coherence, and is
often fairly silly, to the point where the characters start vivid
discussions in the middle of the battle, standing with their backs
towards the enemy. Right.<br /><br />&quot;The Messenger&quot; is a completely wasted attempt at telling the story of
one of the most fascinating women in history. The story, intrigue and
secondary characters are dumbed down to a point that is almost becomes
silly, the pace is dreadfully slow, the action is dull, the dialog and
acting are very unconvincing, and Milla Jovovich completely fails to
make an interesting or even likable character out of Joan.<br /><br />*1/2 out of *****
