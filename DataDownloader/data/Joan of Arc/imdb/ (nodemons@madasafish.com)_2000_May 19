... if you can't stand it like them, then that just goes to show
how
powerful 'Joan of Arc' really is.  It isn't for the faint hearted, and
over
here 'Joan' didn't even go on general release, I guess the BBFC were too
scared to know what a film of such magnitude would have on joe
public.<br /><br />But to be honest, if you aren't horrified by this dazzling,
rough-around-the-edges epic, then there really must be something wrong
with
you.  Likewise, if you see this film epecting to enjoy a 'gore-fest', then
you must really have lax morals.  Personally I came out of my seat five
minutes after the credits because I could barely stand from the shock.
Heck, we all know what happens in the end, no secret - but there's no
'Hollow-Wood' glamour, no 'Braveheart'-type sentimental twaddle.  Death is
death: &quot;I must admit,
you have a great imagination.  Or
maybe not great enough.  Death is
much more simple...&quot;<br /><br />I admit the comparisons came into my head, whilst imagining how Besson
would handle the ending.  So I cringed when Wallace got stretched, but I
had
to cover my eyes as Joan's fate befell her.<br /><br />This is an incredible drama, a superb feeling of true-to-life history
that is just as surreal as Joan's spectacular visions.  Besson makes the
visual atmosphere so intense throughout, encouraged superbly by his and
Birkin's nigh-on-faultless script.<br /><br />Jovovich fits neatly within the persona of the Saint, all her
reactions
and tantrums are so lovingly personal, notably her attempts to stave off
the
judgements of her own conscience (a role entirely posessed by Hoffman).
Also strongly notable were Timothy West as the accuser with compassion and
Richard Ridings as the eccentric La Hire,  I just wonder what John
Malkovich's dialect coach was teaching him!<br /><br />This is what good films should be about, brilliance isn't associated
with happy-endings, nor with box-office sell-outs.  I just wish it would
be
possible for more people to know about, and see this film for the love and
effort that went into it.
