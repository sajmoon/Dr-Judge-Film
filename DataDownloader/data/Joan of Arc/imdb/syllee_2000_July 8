2000_July 8 

After the first 15-20 minutes, I had to leave the theater.  Without a
doubt,
this is the worse film that is supposed to be based on a true story.
Obviously the screenwriter does not know the truth, nor the story and
probably failed history in school. Nothing, and I mean nothing in the
first
15-20 minutes of this film was accurate, save that Joan was female and
lived
in France.<br /><br />I could not tolerate having my intelligence insulted any longer, so I
walked
out.  I just hope that others who have seen the film realize what they saw
bared no resemblance to the true story of Joan.
