I thought this film was kinda weird, despite it being a correct
historical thing of Joan of Arc. Possibly because it is directed and
co-written by Luc Besson, the guy who brought The Fifth Element (which
was spectacular). But still, this film is worth checking out. Mainly
for the performances by Milla Jovovich as the Joan of Arc, who is as
compelling as she is crazy, John Malkovich as the man who will become
king thanks to Joan, Faye Dunaway as the mother of John and Dustin
Hoffman who has a powerful, yet short, performance as the conscience of
Joan. Not exactly a choice pick to watch, but if you run into it, it
isn&#39;t all that bad; not that it doesn&#39;t hold a candle- make that a
lighthouse- to Dreyer&#39;s Joan of Arc.
