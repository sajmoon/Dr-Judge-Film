By no means a perfect film but you have to give it a lot of credit for
trying to do something different with the material. I love the visual
mystery of it all and the at times abstract images. For some reason it
feels like there may have been a lot left out during the editing
process, but a lot of these types of films have that feeling. Milla
Jovovich hit a career high in The Messenger that she has never really
lived up to since. What is brave about this film is that fact that it
takes such a famous historical figure and does not try to deify her or
make her a larger than life hero. She questions herself at every
corner. She is confused half the time. Joan of arc in this film never
seems to be sure of herself and is not above changing her mind at the
last second like in the scene of the retracted confession. Granted,
narratively this film can be a bit muddled, but as texture and
atmosphere, it is hard to beat. Luc Besson has a sly wit that seems out
of place here, for example the scene where an English guard asks &quot;What
is she doing&quot; cut to the French fighters &quot;I don't know!&quot; The score for
the Messenger is very unique, with a combination of abstract
synthesized sounds and large scale orchestra and choir reminiscent of a
biblical epic. I must be honest in saying that I did not entirely like
this film when I first saw it in the theater, but it stuck with me, so
I went back for a repeat viewing and found I liked it a lot better than
I thought. This is a very unique, although not entirely successful take
on a very old story.
