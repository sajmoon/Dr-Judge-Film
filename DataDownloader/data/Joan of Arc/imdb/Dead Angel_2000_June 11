The best film of 1999, this movie deserve *****, the highest. Luc Besson
took an actress, Milla Jovovich, made her do one of the best performances.
People used to look at her body rather than her acting, but in this movie I
was watching both. Director Besson made one of his best films since The
Professional (Leon).<br /><br />Breath taking shots by Thierry Abrogast, made this movie a work of
extravagant beauty. The best Joan of Arc movie. This movie portrays a point
of view that history doesn't look at, like what if Jeanne D'Arc (Joan of
Arc) was crazy and was having these visions out of her imagination. In my
movie list this movie is a classic, this movie is also in my top 25
favourite movies of all time.
