There are many deviations from the accepted facts of Jeanne d'Arc's
life as set out in her trial documentation and the writings of the
time. This said, the central question of whether she was a saint, an
inspired lunatic, wholly mentally ill, or simply a headstrong girl
determined to grab her chances while she could is well asked. Many of
the comments here assert that Besson makes it clear that the Maid was
simply mentally ill, yet I read the film as deeply ambivalent about
what was going on. Were her visions the hallucinations of a
schizophrenic? Were they given by God? What's the difference? More
questions are asked: Why does an omnipotent, omniscient,
all-compassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? What is the
meaning of kingship - to own or to serve? What is the difference
between taking the lives of individuals and killing en masse? What's
the difference between Christianity and the earthly institutions of
that religion? Where does conviction end and fanaticism begin? <br /><br />Jovavich's Jeanne is plagued by the difference between her idea of
utter submission to God and the consequences of doing so; by doubt over
the veracity of her visions; and by the gap between her ideals of the
divine rights of kings and realpolitik. She is constantly on the verge
of a nervous breakdown - is this a manifestation of her mental illness,
or of her &quot;burning for God&quot;? And where's the difference between the
two?<br /><br />The film raises more questions than it answers, and that's as it should
be. It is something of a shame that Besson's film takes liberties with
the facts as we understand them (though history is more often about our
interpretation of events than the events themselves), but in terms of
raising important questions on the nature of faith, it succeeds beyond
measure.
