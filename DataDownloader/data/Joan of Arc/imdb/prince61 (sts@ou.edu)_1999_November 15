While the acting, dialog, writing may not have been the greatest, just
like
in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; the whole movie drives to make one point that
makes
the film worth watching. As in all his previous films the message of this
film is  love and peace are the better alternatives to violence.  That may
seem strange since I have never seen a film so gory!<br /><br />Some may dislike the constant close up in the movie as they make the movie
hard to watch because it is do in your face and it is difficult to ignore
what is happening. For those who want to enjoy a triumphant hero this is
not
a movie, this movie enquires you to think, if you are not willing to
that-don't see it.<br /><br />And on the final note, if you ever have a chance to see Dreyer's 1928 &quot;La
Passion de Jeanne d'Arc&quot; you will see a where Besson got a lot of ideas
for
this picture and also you will get an even more tense account of the trail
of Jeanne.
