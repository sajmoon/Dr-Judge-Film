The story of Joan is a good one on its own.  To take the legend and
twist it not only to unglorify Joan to a raving lunatic, but also to
unglorify God is just a waste of time and money.  The special effects were
so laughable.  A man's head was cut off with blood spurting out and all I
could do was laugh.  The visuals reminded me of the likes of the bad drug
trip scene in Easy Rider.  Haven't special effects been updated since
then?
Lastly, isn't it time we did away with useless rape scenes?  It would be
enough to have family members killed off and a village burned to make a
leading character angry enough to want revenge.  Seems to me that Besson
has
some personal issues to seek counseling for.
