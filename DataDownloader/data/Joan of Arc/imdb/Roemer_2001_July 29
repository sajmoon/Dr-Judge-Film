2001_July 29 

A very clever screenplay: theologically, psychologically, historically and
dramatically almost perfect. You can look at the story of Joan of Arc in all
these four ways and Besson did it all four ways. And made a movie that
satisfies you and makes you wonder, no matter which of the four is your
favorite.<br /><br />This film was a big surprise for me since it had more depth than I could
hope for, more energy than action, more drama than spectacle (although it
didn't exactly lack spectacle!) Dustin Hoffman and Mila Jovovich give
brilliant performances. I rate this movie 9 out of 10.<br /><br />
