1999_May 5 

Chaplin is a good subject and was a terrific filmmaker, but his story is
not
well served here.  The movie limps along, Downey's excellent performance
notwithstanding.  The reporter as plot device -- well done in GANDHI -- is
intrusive here, though it does show off Downey's range.  One might hope
for
Kevin Brownlow to assemble a documentary for Chaplin even half as good as
the stunning BUSTER KEATON: A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW.  Until then, other
sources
will have to do.
