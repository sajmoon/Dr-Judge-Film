An interesting enough look at the life of one of the best comedians ever -
Charlie Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in the title role was
superb. He truly WAS Chaplin in this film. In fact, I found that he so
dominated the film that all others faded into insignificance. Not that there
weren't other good performances. I thought that Dan Aykroyd in particular
was quite convincing as Mack Sennett, Chaplin's first producer who gave him
his break into moving pictures. But Downey dominated. Anthony Hopkins' role
as George Hayden puzzled me. Hayden was the writer that Chaplin had editing
his autobiography, and the movie revolves around his reminiscences with
Hayden, so it sounds as if this would be an important role, but to cast
Hopkins was a waste of his talent. Hayden was important in pushing the story
along, but the part consisted mainly of him asking Chaplin a question, and
the movie then falling into a flashback of that part of Chaplin's life. My
point is that almost anyone could have played this role. It didn't even
begin to stretch Hopkins' talents as an actor.<br /><br />The movie itself whetted the viewers' appetite for knowledge about this
enigmatic character, but in the end doesn't really do a satisfactory job of
providing it. There are suggestions of the problems Chaplin had, but nothing
is really fleshed out. Why his insatiable appetite for young (very young)
women? We know he liked them, but there's no real exploration of the issue.
And most disappointing to me was that there was no real effort put into
Chaplin's blacklisting during the Red Scare after World War II. We discover
that J. Edgar Hoover's animosity toward him went back a long way, and we get
some film clips of the McCarthy hearings, but then we simply learn that
Chaplin has been, in effect, exiled from the United States. There's no meat
to the story. Eventually, it all adds up to Chaplin's reintroduction to
America at the 1972 Academy Awards.<br /><br />It's not a bad movie, and it gives a taste of Charlie Chaplin, but it
doesn't do much to satisfy the viewers' hunger once it's
whetted.<br /><br />5/10.
