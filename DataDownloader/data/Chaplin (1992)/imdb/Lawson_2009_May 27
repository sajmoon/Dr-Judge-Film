Before Robert Downey Jr. became famous for drug abuse and his
subsequent Oscar-nominated comeback, he did his best work as Charlie
Chaplin in this biopic. And good he is with Chaplin&#x27;s physical comedy,
though I felt the movie wasn&#x27;t quite good enough to show off his
dramatic chops.<br /><br />It&#x27;s quite impossible to capture a life in the span of a movie, so
directors essentially have the tough task of picking and assembling the
right vignettes for the audience to understand the essence of the
subject. I don&#x27;t think Richard Attenborough succeeded at his task.<br /><br />The movie is chronological, so it began with Chaplin as a boy, and in a
genius of casting, Geraldine Chapline, Charlie&#x27;s daughter, portrayed
his mother, her grandmother. The story started off at a more leisurely
pace, with much devoted to his comedic roots and what led to his
show-business career. But it felt like at around the halfway mark,
Attenborough realized there was a lot more of Chaplin&#x27;s story untold,
and so he tried to cram everything in. The later half of the movie
would jump from one inspiration for a movie to another, as well as from
one wife to another. It was all quite disjointed and uneven.<br /><br />All in all, it was still a interesting watch, but primarily for
Chaplin&#x27;s story, as portrayed by Downey Jr.
