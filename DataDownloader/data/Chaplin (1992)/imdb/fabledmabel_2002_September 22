When I, as a life-long Chaplin fanatic, heard that Richard Attenborough was
not only making the movie, but casting an American actor in it, I was
depressed for weeks.  After all, how could anyone capture the life of
Charles Chaplin at all in any kind of biography?  I was especially upset
about the casting  -  primarily American actors.  It has always irked me
that U.S.-funded projects insist on Americans portraying English characters,
with phony accents and all - especially because the British actors are so
superior to almost anything America can dredge up.<br /><br />This movie is an exception to all accounts.  It elicited tears and other
emotions from me throughout the entire movie.  Robert Downey Jr.'s
performance was one of the best in film history, and I'm sure that Charlie
would be pleased.  I remember that year at the Academy Awards  -  every
nominee in the Best Actor award category (except one  -  the one who won on
a sympathy vote since he had been nominated several times and had always
lost and who amazingly, this time, gave one of the worst performances of his
life) was excellent.  I was really nerved up at this Oscars night since it
was such a tight contest.  Robert Downey Jr. should have won, but they said
at the time that he was too &quot;new&quot; - something that doesn't matter in today's
Oscar contests but that, then, DID matter very much, so he lost.  He was
AWESOME, however, and I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />The movie, although necessarily clipped for time, got at the heart and soul
of Chaplin's life and character.  Obviously it had to leave out several
accounts of things he did, said, or experienced  -  but summed up everything
of importance.  A viewer can truly can get a sense of Chaplin from this
movie.<br /><br />Every time I watch it I cry.  The movie elicits those kinds of emotions from
anybody who cares about Chaplin, and believes that he is truly one of the
greatest actors and personalities who ever lived.
