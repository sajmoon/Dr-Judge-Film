When i was i was a kid and there was only three TV channels , i
remember on weekends and school holidays they always used to show black
and white comedies. Laurel &#x26; Hardy , Harold Lloyd and my personal
favorites , Abbot &#x26; Costello were the main movies but there is no
doubting who was the daddy of them all and that was Charlie Chaplin.
Richard Attenborough directed this 1992 biographic movie of the famous
Englishman and you would think , considering his previous movies that
this would be fantastic. Sadly it falls a little short of the mark.<br /><br />This is not a bad film at all it&#x27;s just that i don&#x27;t think it does
Chaplin the justice he deserved. Robert Downy Jr is good , especially
when he&#x27;s playing a young Chaplin and the rest of the cast do a good
job but i cant help but feel this film never really works. It&#x27;s quite a
dark film. Chaplin never looks happy and it&#x27;s not until the end where
he is excepting the Oscar do we really get to see a little bit what he
was like on screen. The whole thing with him dictating to a biographer
never works either and for me , this is Attenborough&#x27;s biggest mistake.
I would love to see someone have another go at making a film about
Chaplin and give it a modern spin.<br /><br />Finally , if you have never seen a Charlie Chaplin film , i urge you to
do so. They are so much funnier than some of the so called comedies
they churn out today.
