Don&#39;t get me wrong this is a well done movie Robert Downey Jr. made an
excellent portrayal of Charlie Chaplin but i was let down by many
faults one was that i believe this is one of Lord Attenborough weakest
directions one problem he had was that he didn&#39;t get me interested in
the Charlie Chaplin and the other characters which then bores the
viewer. But the movie has more pro&#39;s than con&#39;s as i said earlier
Robert Downey Jr. does a great portrayal as Chaplin and the supporting
cast also does an excellent job with Dan Aykroyd and Paul Rhys in
particular. Anthony Hopkins also makes a great portrayal but his
character is a bit to short lived. Another positive of this film was
another great score by John Barry who of course is one of the best at
his job. Another positive on this film is the smart and very odd
editing The idea to use old fashioned editing just as how it was done
back in Chaplin&#39;s time is very smart and deserves a positive response.
So in a Overall It is a enjoyable movie but as it get reaches the
middle it becomes a boring and uninteresting picture but what is not
boring is the performances in particular by Robert Downey Jr. But
compared to some other films at this genre and with such a impressive
director and crew it&#39;s a real let down.
