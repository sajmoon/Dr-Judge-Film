Chaplin isn&#39;t really a great bio-pic, but there are moments when
Richard Attenborough&#39;s direction shines and it&#39;s consistently got an
amazing Robert Downey Jr. performance as the title character. In fact,
this is the kind of movie where the lead actor is so important that
some of the major enjoyment and success of the film rests on him/her,
oddly enough since it is a varied and superlative ensemble. There are
moments when Attenborough&#39;s grandiosity gets in the way, and the
moments that mark it as being somewhat conventional. What made me
pleasantly surprised is what Attenborough *did* decide to show with
Chaplin the private man; I thought that he would cut out much of the
stuff with Chaplin&#39;s penchant for young (usually underage) girls, or
some of the things regarding his mother, but most of the notorious
facts are put in for good measure to counter-balance some of the
pompous, though fascinating, scenes of &quot;cinematic history.&quot; <br /><br />Now as a fan of Chaplin&#39;s films and the given acknowledgment that he&#39;s
one of the most talented comic actors and filmmakers of the 20th
century, I do get a little choked up seeing that final clip-show at the
Oscars of great clips from his most famous movies. And it&#39;s interesting
always, from just a movie-buff stand-point, to watch the history behind
Chaplin&#39;s transition from vaudeville to Max Senett&#39;s film company to
slowly becoming an independent and world-famous auteur/star. But for
the most part the writing and the direction make it entertaining just
on that conventional, rise-fall-rise-fall-struggle-success-at-end story
with maybe less drugs and a bit more politics than one might usually
see (save for one fantastic scene when Chaplin and his brother and
friends are sneaking around the film footage of The Kid from the brass
who want it for tax purposes).<br /><br />What makes it almost outstanding, however, is Downey Jr. He&#39;s funny as
Chaplin when he needs to show how he was a great clown (i.e. the
&#39;old-drunk&#39; bit), he&#39;s melancholy when needed, he plays Chaplin as
young, middle-aged, and old perfectly, and there&#39;s just the slightest
details that keep you glued to the screen to see what he&#39;ll do next.
It&#39;s not exactly a breakthrough role as he&#39;d been doing some really
good work intermittently in the late 80s, but this is the one that got
him recognition by the likes of the Academy, and rightfully so. It&#39;s
masterful work in a decent tribute to Sir Charles &quot;Tramp&quot; Chaplin, and
should delight those looking for a good ensemble and a commanding lead
performance.
