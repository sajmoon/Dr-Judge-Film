    &quot;Chaplin&quot; is an incredible film about one of the most incredible and
controversial icons in Hollywood history.  Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly
cast as Charlie Chaplin, and it is his brilliant performance which earned
the Oscar nomination that he deserved and received.  Richard Attenborough
did a masterful job directing this masterpiece of biographical films.  Two
actors who are underrated for their performances are Paul Rhys (who played
Sidney Chaplin), and Moria Kelly
(who played both roles of Hetty Kelly and Oona O'Neil Chaplin). 
Kevin
Kline is amazing as Douglas Fairbanks.  There is one scene in the film where
Douglas Fairbanks, knowing he is ill, looks at his reflection in a mirror on
the bar.  That is one example of the symbolism throughout the film by
director Richard Attenborough that is astonishing.  Robert Downey, Jr.,
plays off the great Sir Anthony Hopkins will ease.  It is a wonder that with
all of his personal problems in his relatively young life that Robert
Downey, Jr. doesn't appreciate the opportunities that have been handed to
him.  There is incredible talent in this film - including a previously
Oscar-winning director and actor (Attenborough and Hopkins, respectively)
and a female actor who would win an Oscar for another film that same year of
1992 (Marisa Tomei).  Even Dan Aykroyd is almost overlooked as silent comedy
filmmaker Mack Sennett.  Through &quot;Chaplin&quot; we realize that it was Mack
Sennett who discovered Charlie Chaplin as well as other comedy greats at the
beginning of Hollywood history.  &quot;Chaplin&quot; is underrated and sometimes
underappreciated, but it is a brilliant film that should be considered a
classic when the time is appropriate.
