Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is a glossy, passionate biography
picture about the life and (sometimes) work of Charles Chaplin, one of
the indisputable geniuses of the cinema. It is also quite long-winded
and commonly on the wrong track, but is ultimately carried aloft by a
plethora of incredible performances and the skills of its director. It
displays the life of Charles Chaplin, according to two biographies,
starting when he was a young child saving face for his mother at a
disastrous theater showing in Europe, to the eve of receiving his
Honorary Academy Award in 1972, five years before his death. Along the
way, the film processes mostly his personal life, his sexual relations
with women far younger than he was, his political controversies
including a costly spat with J. Edgar Hoover, and the way the public
reacted to him at various points in time.<br /><br />And as that sort of biography, &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is a beautiful, if bloated
biopic and is quite enjoyable as that. It is partly for that reason
that I still recommend it, however, this movie is a missed opportunity.
For even though this is a very compelling story about a man&#x27;s life, the
way that director Attenborough and his three screenwriters (William
Boyd, Bryan Forbes, and William Goldman) have structured it, it could
have been a biography about any man&#x27;s life. The movie is far more
concerned about Mr. Chaplin the person and not Mr. Chaplin the
filmmaker, even though Mr. Chaplin&#x27;s films were oftentimes directly
reflective of what was taking place in the world at that time, and how
the public responded to him. It shows that he was a successful
director, but very seldom showing how pain-stakingly he made his
movies, rehearsing and planning for ages, shooting take after take
until he was satisfied.<br /><br />But enough of the negatives, because I don&#x27;t want to sound too down on
a movie that I did like. Let&#x27;s start with what does work. First of all,
the performances are universally excellent. Robert Downey Jr., one of
the most versatile of contemporary actors, was given the
challenge-posing and highly demanding role of playing Charles Chaplin
and the results are on the level of sheer genius. It is a testament of
an actor&#x27;s capability when a hardened critic watches him perform and
believes in him as a character and a person, not as a paid performer
orating rehearsed dialogue. This is one of Mr. Downey&#x27;s best
performances and that is really saying something. The rest of the cast
includes names such as Anthony Hopkins, John Rhys, Geraldine Chaplin,
Dan Akyroyd, Milla Jovovich, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Kline, James Wood,
Kevin Dunn, Diane Lane, and the list goes on. Everybody is buttoned up
and solid, whether they are playing a real person, or a fictionalized
one. And the performances do make up for a lot of what is lacking in
the screenplay. The most engaging parts of the story are the ones
involving Mr. Chaplin&#x27;s politics. His movies, as we know, oftentimes
reflected his beliefs. Knowing what these agendas were and seeing how
they played in real life with those involved is fascinating.<br /><br />Also, director Attenborough&#x27;s skill with the motion picture camera is
evident. His misc en scene, photography, and coordination with his cast
is magnificent. The way he stages re-enactments of scenes in Chaplin
movies are just as hilarious as they really are. And you can feel the
passion that he instilled into making the movie; he is a filmmaker who
is showing respect to another filmmaker. Even if he doesn&#x27;t quite
accomplish it to the hilt. And everybody&#x27;s talents all come together in
a mesmerizing scene at the end that is so powerful that it compelled
and begged me to forgive the movie for all of the flaws that I observed
in the preceding hundred and twenty minutes.<br /><br />Mr. Attenborough&#x27;s film does not realize its full potential and he
should have realized that Charles Chaplin&#x27;s life was so expansive that
it would be difficult to contain it all within one film, but he did
succeed in making a nice little biopic. If only he had cut down on some
of the long-winded moments, particularly the latter ones between Mr.
Downey and Mr. Hopkins, and showed us more of Chaplin the filmmaker.
This type of film has been done better, but &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is a modest
success and a showcase for its cast&#x27;s talent.
