The film is essentially an autobiography of the Life of Charles
Chaplin. For a youngster of this generation this movie was highly
informative.<br /><br />It is a very enjoyable two and a half hour movie that will surely keep
engaged thanks to a brilliant performance by ROBERT DOWNEY JR. I
wouldn&#x27;t have complained had he won the Oscar that year. But he surely
is very very unlucky for having Pacino&#x27;s scent of a woman performance
as a co- nominee. <br /><br />And Mind you the second time he gets nominated, he has The Joker as his
co- nominee. But it surely has escalated my fan hood for Robert Downey
Jr and it clearly shows his versatility <br /><br />He did nearly perfect the role of Chaplin and mastered all his
mannerisms with great ease It was hard to think that it wasn&#x27;t Chaplin
in real but RD Jr playing his role. The movie gave me a real info on
the real life of Charles Chaplin, since i had little idea about it.<br /><br />The movie is a journey of Chaplin&#x27;s life in which we see his romantic
link-ups with numerous women throughout his life until he finds him
perfect match. The movie also shows how America treated him as an
outcast after he had worked for them for almost 50 years.<br /><br />It was interesting to know that all his movies were funny anecdotes on
the prevalent system of government then. It beautifully shows the up&#x27;s
and down&#x27;s of his life and we get to have a closer look at Chaplin the
real person behind the make up. <br /><br />It is definitely a movie not to be missed about one of the greatest
actors in Cinema. In the climax we get to see the real intention
Chaplin had behind making those movies<br /><br />I would give it 9\10..<br /><br />its is bit underrated in IMDb..deserves 7.8.
