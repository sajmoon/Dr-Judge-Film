When you make a biography of a historical figure, you have to realize
that, no matter how interesting or complex their life is, you can only
put so much in. Some writers/directors are able to edit the life story
of a person down to two hours or less (&quot;The Desert Fox&quot; and most old
Warner Brothers' biopics being good examples of this). When this is too
difficult, often (as in the case of &quot;Patton&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;)
the film will focus on a specific important period of the character's
life. &quot;Chaplin&quot; tries to focus on all of Chaplin's life over the course
of a two and a half hour movie, and fails miserably.<br /><br />Well, that isn't fair. I shouldn't say it's a complete failure. In
terms of production values, it does a great job of capturing the time
period portrayed - the '20s and '30s, when cinema was first turning
from a novelty into the art form and indispensible entertainment medium
it is today. Robert Downey, Jr. does a fantastic job as Chaplin, and
deserves all the credit he has gotten for his performance.<br /><br />But the fact is, Chaplin's life is too complex and multi-faceted to fit
into a two-and-a-half hour film - maybe even into a four hour epic,
like &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Most of the major events and people and in
his life are barely touched upon before the film moves on. Admittedly,
they pretty much have to, the way the film is set up. But innumerable
should-be-important characters are scuttled after only a few minutes of
screen time.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a huge rogue's gallery of A- and B-list stars in
cameos and supporting roles, with very mixed results. The best are
Geraldine Chaplin, ingeniously cast as her own grandmother; Kevin Dunn
as J. Edgar Hoover (though IMO his character was given perhaps too
prominent of a part); Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks; and Dan Ankroyd
as the director who first made Chaplin a star. The rest of the cast is,
as said above, a riot of cameo appearances, with actors like Diane
Lane, Marisa Tomei, and James Woods (to name a few of the more
prominent examples) on screen just long enough for the viewer to say,
&quot;Hey, it's -!&quot; - which, needless to say, gets annoying after awhile.
Anthony Hopkins' author character in particular is a waste of that fine
actor's talent. And while it's amusing to see a teenage Milla Jovovich
and pre-&quot;X-Files&quot; David Duchovny before they became famous, they're
certainly not enough to watch the movie for. If this were just the case
for one or two characters, it would be no problem, but there are
undoubtedly going to be problems when pretty much EVERY FRICKIN'
CHARACTER falls under such a category.<br /><br />As a film, &quot;Chaplin&quot; is hit or miss. It's got a number of good elements
- Attenborough's great direction, Downey's fine performance, and a few
of the more prominent supporting characters - but unfortunately tries
to cram too much into 143 minutes. I'd suggest checking it out, but
don't expect a masterpiece.<br /><br />5/10
