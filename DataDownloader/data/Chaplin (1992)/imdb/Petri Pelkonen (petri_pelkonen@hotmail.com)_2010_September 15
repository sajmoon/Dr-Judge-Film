Charles Spencer Chaplin (1889-1977) is one of the most known men of the
20th century.So him if anybody deserves a movie.Chaplin (1992) is
directed by the veteran movie man Richard Attenborough (b.1923).The
movie shows how the elderly Chaplin looks back in his life in
1963.Charlie lived his early years in poverty in Britain.And his mother
Hannah went insane.Charlie found comfort from comedy.Then Mack Sennett
got him in moving pictures in America and the rest is movie
history.This is a well told story of the little tramp and the man
behind the character.Although it is flawed, just like the man himself
was, I still enjoyed watching this movie for the second time,
actually.Robert Downey Jr. really nails the part of Chaplin.Geraldine
Chaplin, Charlie&#x27;s daughter, plays his mother Hannah, and she&#x27;s really
good.Paul Rhys is excellent as his brother Sidney.John Thaw is
brilliant as Fred Karno.Moira Kelly is fantastic in dual role, playing
Hetty Kelly and Oona O&#x27;Neill.Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing a
fictional character called George Hayden, to whom Charlie talks about
his life.Dan Aykroyd is terrific as Mack Sennett, the king of
comedy.Marisa Tomei is very good as Mabel Normand.Penelope Ann Miller
is wonderful as Edna Purviance.Kevin Kline is marvelous as Douglas
Fairbanks.Matthew Cottle plays the part of a fellow comedian, Stan
Laurel.Maria Pitillo is Mary Pickford.Milla Jovovich is Mildred
Harris.Kevin Dunn portrays J. Edgar Hoover.Deborah Moore is Lita
Grey.Diane Lane plays the part of Paulette Goddard.Nancy Travis plays
Joan Barry.James Woods is Joseph Scott, an attorney.David Duchovny
portrays Roland Totheroh, a cameraman.Michael A. Goorjian plays Charles
Chaplin Jr.In archive footage we see people like Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau.We also see some actual footage of Chaplin&#x27;s movies.There are
some memorable moments in this movie.It&#x27;s amusing to watch his clowning
routine as a young man.You know, the drunk bit.You get moved when
Charlie hears about his old sweetheart&#x27;s, Hetty Kelly&#x27;s death.The Oscar
sequence at the end is pretty touching.Tears roll down on his face, as
he watches clips of his old movies.I bought a few years ago the
fantastic autobiography of Charles Chaplin, of which this movie is
based on.Chaplin lived a fascinating life and this movie does rather
fine job telling the story of this fascinating man.
