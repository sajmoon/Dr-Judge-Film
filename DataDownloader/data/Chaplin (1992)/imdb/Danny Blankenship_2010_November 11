For the first time in many years I once again decided to review
&#x22;Chaplin&#x22; and I must say it&#x27;s a near perfect masterpiece. I for one am
a big fan of biographies. I like a good historical and personal account
of one&#x27;s life especially if it&#x27;s educational and informative and this
picture is all of that! The film told thru a history style interview an
older Chaplin tells his story to a book author by flashback. Starting
in the beginning when him and his brother started out with humble days
in impoverished London. Chaplin&#x27;s mother a stage singer who falls to
illness that occurrence oddly opens the door for young Charlie to start
performing on stage first with dance steps and fall down comedy acts.
And his brother becomes Charlie&#x27;s agent as he matures and expands his
act.<br /><br />When Charles relocates to California the success starts to come as an
actor in silent pictures and he even takes his hand at the directing
chair! So fame and success has been discovered.<br /><br />Yet you learn a lot about Chaplin his problems with females were his
biggest downfall troubled marriages and affairs plus his taste for
underage girls would bite him back. And his struggles with the studio
system was shown as Charles fought against the talking picture most of
his acting days. Most revealing is his dinner chat with FBI man J.
Edgar Hoover in which Charlie being blunt and brash like he is reveals
his left leaning political feelings as he was a poster boy for
communism and social justice for immigrants something I didn&#x27;t know.
These admissions made Chaplin a target for government investigations as
his personal and private life was torn upside down. In fact he&#x27;s even
banned from the United States and he exiles to Switzerland for many
years before returning in 1972 for an honorary Oscar speech! Robert
Downey. Jr. was in top notch form as Charlie Chaplin his moves,
expressions, and accent were dead on in fact Downey was Oscar nominated
for the role. And the supporting cast was star studded with Kevin
Kline, Dan Aykroyd, Milla Jovovich, Nancy Travis, and Diane Lane.
Really this film is a must for any film student to watch it&#x27;s
educational and informative you learn stuff about Charlie that you
would have never thought. It shows that cinema&#x27;s first pop culture
legend was authentic and real with zeal and zest only complex,
controversial and torn inside by vices of sex, and stubbornness.
&#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is an excellent educational biography.
