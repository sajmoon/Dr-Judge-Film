Throughout the film, I just couldn't shake the feeling that the
director, Richard Attenborough, was trying to emulate both the styles
of Oliver Stone and Milos Foreman in hopes of making this already
lacking film, screenplay-wise, into the next Amedeus.<br /><br />And to me, that is the greatest shame because the subject material is
so interesting and could have been done so much better if the director
could've had a little more confidence in what he was doing and did it
himself and if the writing could've been a little more inspired.<br /><br />But, that aside, the film is an interesting, and quick, glance at the
life of Charlie Chaplin (great acting done by Robert Downey Jr. by the
by) and suffices in describing the more eventful aspects of his life
and all that fed it the line.<br /><br />Chaplin 8/10 because it's Chaplin, and who couldn't help but be happy,
especially when he makes one so sad.
