  Well Done!! 
   Everything is perfect in here. Beautiful film about a man who became a
legend and a cinema icon.
  
  It was a great challenge to the american actor Robert Downey Jr but the
results could not be better.
  
  Since the beginning of the film we see all about Chaplin's career and
life.
  The actors were well casted and Kevin Kline was perfect as Doug Fairbanks.<br /><br />  Fantastic!  10/10
