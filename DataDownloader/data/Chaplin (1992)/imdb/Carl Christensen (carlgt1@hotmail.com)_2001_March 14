I'm pretty surprised this film gets a 6.8 rating while historical dreck
like
&quot;Titanic&quot; is at 7.2.  &quot;Chaplin&quot; is a very good film.  If Attenborough put
in
the entire Chaplin autobiography; I imagine the nay-sayers here would then
complain about the length of the movie.  It's a very well balanced film.
The only flaw is the continual connections of Chaplin's first love with
all
of his wives until his final &quot;perfect&quot; wife Oona (as she's played by the
same actress as his first love).  But Attenborough's direction is
excellent,
as is Downey's acting.
