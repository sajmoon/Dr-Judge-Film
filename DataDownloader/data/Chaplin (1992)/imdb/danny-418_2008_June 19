Sir Richard Attenborough&#39;s biographical film of the life and times of
Charles Chaplin is a little thin as a narrative, but it is so
charmingly creative and ultimately moving, it&#39;s hard to care about any
deficits. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job re-creating Chaplin&#39;s
graceful slapstick and getting inside the silent-film superstar&#39;s head
over many years of triumph, defeat, scandal, official persecution,
exile, and inner peace. A huge cast portray the allies, friends,
lovers, and enemies in Chaplin&#39;s life, including Moira Kelly as his
final, longtime wife, Oona, Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks, Geraldine
Chaplin as Charlie&#39;s mother, and James Woods as a prosecutor working
hard to nail Chaplin for anti-American sentiments. Attenborough
declines to tell the story in a flat, linear way, employing such clever
techniques as detailing one chapter in Chaplin&#39;s life as a silent
comedy. The climactic scene set at an Oscar tribute for Chaplin will
get the tears flowing.
