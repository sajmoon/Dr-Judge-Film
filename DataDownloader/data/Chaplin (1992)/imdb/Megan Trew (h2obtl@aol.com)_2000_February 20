If you love movies or like Charlie Chaplin or Robert Downey
Jr. , this movie is a must.The first time I saw this movie was
in October,1999 and I fell in love with it.The story begins with
Chaplin being interviewed in the 1960's.Then shows Charlie at
age 5 in 1894 after that the movie shows a little more of
Charlie's poverty-stricken life.At the part of Chaplin's early
career but after that the movie starts to wind down.It does have
lots of info about his personal life and a little about his
movies.It is quite easy to get lost in this story unless you
know some information about Charlie Chaplin.<br /><br />My favorite part of this great movie is the very end at the
Academy Awards in 1972 when Chaplin is getting an award for all
the achievements of him.Everyone including Charlie are watching a
nice presentation of most the movies he's made in his
career.Near the end of the presentation , Chaplin sheds a tear
and that seems to always make me cry too.The presentation ends
showing the end of his movie &quot;The Circus&quot;(1928) and then are the
credits.The second and last song played during the credits is my
favorite song in the movie and the saddest(it always makes me
cry).It this is the beat of that song:
da da,da da, da da, da da, da do da (you'll hear the tune and
the rest of this and the many other great songs in the
movie).This is a great movie and I would definitely recommend
this to anyone who enjoys great movies and I would give this
movie 10 stars and two thumbs up.Rent it,buy it,wait for it on
tv,go to a friend or family's house or take it out of your movie
collection.
