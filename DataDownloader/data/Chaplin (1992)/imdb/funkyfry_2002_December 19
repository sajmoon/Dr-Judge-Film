An attempt to make a film that is both honest and at the same time
shamelessly self-serving about its (auto)biographical subject -- the
legendary comedian/director Chaplin -- is pulled off with style.  It's fun
to see some modern talents inhabit the roles of screen's bygone icons
(though in some cases a little less charicature would have been appreciated,
especially in the case of Mabel Normand).  Kline, surprisingly enough, makes
a convincing Fairbanks.  The rest of the cast is also well-picked -- X-Files
fans should watch closely to catch quite a few glimpses of lower-billed
David Duchovny as Chaplin's personal editor.  <br /><br />The direction is very good; I particularly liked how some of the straight
scenes were filmed in a comic, surrealist style (Chaplin's escape from the
police w/ his cans of &quot;the Kid&quot; reels is staged like a Keystone Komedy),
while some of what might have been more comic elements are played straight
(Chaplin's attempt to convince his brother that &quot;The Tramp&quot; cannot talk in a
movie is both funny and serious, for example).  Some of the (perhaps true to
life) melodramatic elements are a bit overplayed (the bit with his mom was
handled too heavily for my tastes, especially her shouting his name as she's
dragged away by the asylum guards), but generally the film avoids genre
cliches and &quot;easy&quot; scenes.  <br /><br />Great photography.<br /><br />Downey Jr. fits the roll well, even rising to many of the physical
challenges of the Chaplin mystique.<br /><br />A superior film of its type, laced with self-conscious humor and
self-reflection on the artistic temperament.
