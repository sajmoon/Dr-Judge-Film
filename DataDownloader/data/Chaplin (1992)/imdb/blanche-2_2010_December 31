Robert Downey, Jr. is &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; in this 1992 film also starring
Geraldine Chaplin, Moira Kelly, Paul Rhys, John Thaw, Anthony Hopkins,
Dan Akroyd, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, and Kevin Kline. It
can&#x27;t be easy to do a biopic. This one borrows from Chaplin&#x27;s own
autobiography and the definitive Chaplin biography by David Robinson. I
suspect more of it comes from the autobiography.<br /><br />The film takes us through Chaplin&#x27;s life, from his first moments on a
stage replacing his mother to his old age in Switzerland and, finally,
his returning to America after exile in 1952 to receive an honorary
Academy Award. In between, Chaplin evolves into the great artist that
he became, slept with and married jail bait, and is finally driven out
of the country, thanks to the efforts of J. Edgar Hoover, who had a
1900 page file on Chaplin. Considering that the largest file Hoover had
on anyone was that of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s, one can only imagine how many
pages Sinatra&#x27;s held.<br /><br />&#x22;Chaplin&#x22; isn&#x27;t a perfect movie - there&#x27;s something a little
cardboard-y about some of the characters. Kevin Kline plays Douglas
Fairbanks, Sr. Kline looks like Errol Flynn and is younger and trimmer
than Fairbanks. None of these characters -- Mabel Normand, Edna
Purviance, Mac Sennett, Mary Pickford, Paulette Goddard, etc., are
particularly well fleshed out. The film does show actual footage from
&#x22;Modern Times,&#x22; &#x22;The Kid,&#x22; &#x22;The Great Dictator,&#x22; and other Chaplin
masterpieces, which are wonderful to see.<br /><br />Downey does a fabulous job as Chaplin. It is a poignant,
multidimensional performance taking in both the man and the artist who
wanted his work to say something as well as entertain. Downey handles
the physical requirements of the role well - and Chaplin was as
graceful as any ballerina and known for his physical stunts. He does
excellently with the aging Chaplin as well.<br /><br />Geraldine Chaplin as her own grandmother gives a wonderful performance,
a very touching one of a woman who loses her grip with reality.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
