The first thing one should know about &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is that, paradoxically,
very little of it has to do with Chaplin. Or, at least, it has more to
do with the writers&#x27; illusions of him. The film claims to be based on
&#x22;My Autobiography&#x22; and on &#x22;Chaplin: His Life and Art&#x22;, by David
Robinson. Having re-read the Autobiography before watching the film, it
is clear to me that what the writers did was take basic incidents from
the autobiography and embellish them with, I can only assume, parts of
the Robinson book. What results is a series of scenes which were
vaguely influenced by the facts, but so simplified and primitive that
little of the original truth remains. <br /><br />What the writers did not wish to acknowledge was that when Chaplin
wrote vaguely or skimmed past certain parts of his life, he really
didn&#x27;t want anyone to delve into them - and the filmmakers did just
that. &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; is not really about Charlie Chaplin, his work and
films. It is simply ceaseless speculation on his personal life, but
going on even more vaguely about it than the Autobiography. <br /><br />I am well aware that almost every biopic focuses more on the personal
life of a person than on their work. The problem is that most of the
characters in &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; are so exaggerated and simplified that they
become almost completely unbelievable - both as the real people AND as
fictional characters. None of them are fully developed. This is not
entirely the fault of the supporting cast (although it really is not
that interesting): the fault lies with the screenplay, which is too
often bland and melodramatic. This is especially obvious in the
ridiculous subplot concerning the older Chaplin and his editor, which
is the most pointless and badly done part of the film; even Hopkins
cannot make the lines sound credible, which is all the proof anyone
needs of their mediocrity. The film would have worked immeasurably
better without these additions. <br /><br />Many of the most interesting aspects and parts of Chaplin&#x27;s life are
completely ignored, oddly, with seemingly irrelevant or less important
stories added in for little reason. One scene in particular is added
only to insert a Chaplin-esquire physical comedy sequence which falls
flat. The writers greatly accentuated everything to do with Hetty
Kelly, even making the same actress play Oona O&#x27;Neill; the tried too
hard to give him some kind of motive for his relationships, which only
leads to more bias and speculation; and although I am by no means a
Chaplin purist or even a very knowledgeable admirer, the blatant
alterations on the actual history grated on my nerves.<br /><br />All this being said, the film is certainly not a terrible one. Mainly,
however, this is for one reason only, and that is - yes - Robert Downey
Jr. himself. The praise he received for the role is by no means
undeserved. As Chaplin he is perfect, managing to make the best out of
his rather predictable lines, remaining interesting, believable, and in
many parts moving. He has wonderful timing and intensity, and even
looks the part (he could even do the roll dance). I really quite
believed he was Chaplin. Even his performance, however, suffers greatly
because of the lines - and the flash-forwards. I have no doubt that he
could have played an even better Charlie Chaplin in a differently made
film.<br /><br />The greatest scene in &#x22;Chaplin&#x22;, I think, is the opening credits:
Charlie arrives in his dressing room, alone, sits, and begins to remove
his make-up. The scene is in black and white, and there is no dialogue
- only music. Every emotion is expressed simply through his eyes. If
the rest of the film had been made like this, I actually think it could
have been perfect. Either way, the lead performance is astounding, the
music is beautiful, and though not very insightful or too true to
history, this film is well worth watching.
