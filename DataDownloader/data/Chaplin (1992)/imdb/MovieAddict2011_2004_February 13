Chaplin<br /><br />Decent film biography about the life of Charlie Chaplin, arguably the most
well-known comedian of all time (a close bet with The Three Stooges and The
Marx Brothers). Robert Downey, Jr. looks the part--can he act?
Surprisingly...yes, sometimes, he can. This is a worthwhile film for a
handful of reasons--but it's really not Oscar material or anything. Also
starring Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for language, a surprisingly amount of sexual content and
nudity.<br /><br />*** out of *****
