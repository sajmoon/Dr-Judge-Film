Not many people I know have seen this hidden treasure. My Grandparents
are huge Chaplin fans, which is how I came across this movie. I have
been watching it once a year for about seven years and each time I
notice something different.<br /><br />The opening scene is what really draws me in. A sullen Chaplin sitting
in his dark dressing room. While the opening credits role Chaplin
begins to remove his make up. This scene is telling us that we are
about to see the man behind the tramp. A scary yet exciting thought.
Chaplin led a very interesting life and Attenborough captured this in
every scene.<br /><br />My favourite thing about the film is the score. I often say that music
really does make the movie and for this, John Barry was spot on. The
haunting score captures Chaplin&#39;s change. In the first scenes the score
is dark, dull, damp just like 1900s London. It brightens up a little
when Chaplin reaches California. The best track is number 9. I will not
say the name or mention too much as it may result in a possible
spoiler. This track is played when Chaplin is travelling back to London
for the first time since 1913. He receives some bad news about an old
friend just as the train pulls up at the station. He must quickly dry
his eyes before greeting the crazy crowd. Chaplin successfully pulls
himself together and gives the crowd a smile but behind this smile we
can see heartbreak. Excellent acting from Robert Downey Jr. Although I
love Al Pacino I still think that Downey Jr deserved the academy award
that year.<br /><br />If you are not a Chaplin fan then you may not enjoy this movie as much
as I did but it is still worth the watch. Who knows watching this may
open up a New World of Chaplinism for you?
