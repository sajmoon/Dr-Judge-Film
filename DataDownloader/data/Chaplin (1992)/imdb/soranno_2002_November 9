This 1992 Tristar Pictures release chronicles the life and times of screen
comedy legend Charlie Chaplin who's portrayed here by Robert Downey Jr.
Downey gives a mostly credible performance in this lengthy biopic which
covers the majority of Chaplin's life and goes over several life and film
career highlights. Several of Chaplin's closest associates are also
depicted
among an all star cast. These include Dan Aykroyd as Mack Sennett,
Geraldine
Chaplin as Charlie's mother, Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks, Diane Lane
as
Paulette Goddard and Marisa Tomei as Mabel Normand. One of the better
biopics of recent years.
