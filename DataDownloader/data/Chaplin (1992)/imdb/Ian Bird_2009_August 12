:the movie Chaplin with Robert Downey Jr. i bought this movie expecting
just a regular autobiography but got way more. i watched this movie
with a smile on my face the whole time.It takes a look into the life
and times of a true genius. i am a big fan of Charlie Chaplin so i felt
the need to be extra critical but was completely blown away with the
Acting and the realism and it is truly a great movie so pick up Chaplin
