&quot;Chaplin&quot; is a great movie about the life of &quot;The Little Tramp&quot;, Charlie
Chaplin.  He led a life that intrigued many people, and this movie provides
all out entertainment for those who want to learn about every scandalous
affair and secrets behind his political associations.  Robert Downey Jr.
gives his best performance as Chaplin, and it also features an all star
cast
including Anthony Hopkins, Kevin Kline, Dan Aykroyd, Marisa Tomei, and many
more.<br /><br />Nominated for 3 Oscars, &quot;Chaplin&quot; is a great biography of the sometimes
controversial comedic genius.  I give it a 9 out of 10.
