Personally True Story Dramas Are Very Hard For Me To Like Because Of
The Fact That They Are Based Around Things That Aren&#x27;t Really
Interesting, This However Is About One Of The Kings Of Comedy, Charles
Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr Puts A Truly Unforgettable Performance As
Chaplin. The One Thing That Got Me Was When They Skip To Chaplin&#x27;s
Oscar And The Country That Kicked Him Out Loved Him Then, It Got Me
Shedding A Couple Of Tears. I Also Highly Recommend This To Anyone Who
Is Interested In Chaplin Even If Only Remotely.<br /><br />The One Thing That Got Me P#issed Off With The Real People That
Ridiculed Chaplin Is That All He Ever Did Was Try To Make People Laugh,
Even Though I&#x27;ve Never Met Them It Makes Them Complete @ssholes They
Had No Idea How Hard It Would&#x27;ve Been To Think Up Of The Tramp And
Sustain Him For 31 Years, I&#x27;m Not Saying &#x22;Oh St. Charlie&#x22; I&#x27;m Just
Saying That To Actually Try To Kick Someone Out Of The Country Or To
Find A Flaw In Him Is Just F#ucking Stupid And The Human Race Has Been
Doing It For 2000 Years.
