I think this was a great movie, and absolutely LOVED RDJr. in it.  I think
it does a very good job at telling the story of Chaplin and also that
Robert
deserved the nomination he got.  I'm not too good at writing reviews(which
is why i watch movies, not review them) but i just think this movie was
done
very well and can think of very few things i may have changed.<br /><br />
