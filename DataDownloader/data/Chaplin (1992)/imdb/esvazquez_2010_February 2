I have admired Charles Chaplin since my childhood. I was only 7 when he
died, but I was sorry to hear he was gone. I was particularly shocked
at &#x22;Limelight&#x22;. I&#x27;ve seen Attenborough&#x27;s Chaplin many times. Robert
Downey Jr.looks like a real Chaplin. Isn&#x27;t it funny to see Geraldine
Chaplin play her own grandmother? The recreation of late Victorian
London is superb. So is the recreation of early XXth.century US. It is
by no means easy to recreate a screen giant like Chaplin, and Downey
does recreate him. I&#x27;m afraid there will never be another Chaplin. His
legitimate heir might have been Woody Allen, who has unfortunately
become too commercial in the last 20 years. He&#x27;s lost the wonderful
critical outlook on mankind he used to don in the 1970s.and 1980s.
Chaplin never lost it. He had it in 1915 and kept it when shooting &#x22;A
king in New York&#x22; 42 years later.
