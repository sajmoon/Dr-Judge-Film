This was an amazing piece of motion picture! Robert Downey Jr gives a
brilliant performance as the man behind the moustache and proves there
is always a story to be told behind the camera. This Chaplin seemed
almost traumatised within and always seemed to be struggling to find a
certain kind of happiness just like the rest of us which makes the
film.<br /><br />It was interesting to see the private life of the 'little tramp' even
if it was not always favoured by the public. This only proves he was
human just like the rest of the whole world! <br /><br />If you manage to catch this make sure you watch it until the end
because that was my favourite part, to see him as an old man after
everything he achieved through out his life.<br /><br />If you can't find this on the television and you are a Chaplin fan or
merely curious find it on DVD because you will not be disappointed!
