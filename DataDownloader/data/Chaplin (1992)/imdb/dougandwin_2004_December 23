This film should have won an Academy Award for Robert Downey Jnr. - he
was nominated and beaten for the ultimate honor, but it should never
have been. He is magnificent in his portrayal of a rare genius, and I
must add that the Make-up artists had Chaplin recreated beautifully at
all ages. The supporting cast was very good, but the were very much
subservient to Downey (who, until I saw this movie was in my opinion, a
very ordinary performer!) Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks was
excellent (he looked more like Errol Flynn though), and the actresses
who played Charlie's wives were very good - particularly Paulette
Goddard's re-creator. The atmosphere of all the periods covered was
very authentic and I cannot help but come back and say &quot;a brilliant
effort&quot; by Robert Downey.
