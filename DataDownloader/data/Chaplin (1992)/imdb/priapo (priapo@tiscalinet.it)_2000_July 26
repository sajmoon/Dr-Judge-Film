&quot;Chaplin&quot; is a very good film (I voted it with a 9), but I think it is
impossible to summarize his life in a movie of about two
hours. Many details of him are not very clear.  So I think the film must be
seen ONLY as a tribute to one of the icons of the 20th century. Maybe
another reason to see the film is the good
description of Hollywood in those years.<br /><br />This film has certainly to be seen, but if you want to know  Chaplin, you
have to see his movies (this is also said in the same &quot;Chaplin&quot;)
