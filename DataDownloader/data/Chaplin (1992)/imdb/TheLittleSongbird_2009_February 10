This film is beautiful and intelligent, if a little ambitious and
overlong (2 and a quarter hours). But it is so worth seeing, for the
superb Oscar-nominated performance from Robert Downey Junior. The film
starts off flawlessly, with beautiful incidental music from John Barry,
and a fantastic performance from Geraldine Chaplin, who played her own
grandmother. <br /><br />We also see Fred Karno, robustly played by John Thaw, and Hetty ,
played by Moira Kelly(who did struggle with the accent). A standout
from the supporting cast, was a lively performance from Kevin Kline,
who brought some great energy into the role of Douglas Fairbanks. The
performances in general are very good indeed, and the film looks
ravishing with show stopping costumes and scenery.<br /><br />However, it is after the death of Fairbanks, that the film starts to
drag, and the title characters rapidly turn into a series of vignettes.
As much a great actor Anthony Hopkins is, his turn as the fictional
autobiographer was perhaps unnecessary. And I was a bit confused why
they turned Hoover as a villain who wanted Chaplin out of the country.
The ending is poignant, and Moira Kelly does better in her role as
Oona. <br /><br />The end credits were very educational, and the arrangement of Smile was
one of my highlights of this beautifully made but ambitious film. Worth
watching for those who are a fan of Richard Attenborough (the director)
