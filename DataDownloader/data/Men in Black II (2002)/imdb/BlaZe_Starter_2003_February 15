This movie definitely had its funny moments...but they were blinded by
the
weirdness of this film. The first Men In Black was both funny and a
little
weird, but a &quot;just right&quot; amount of weirdness. So my point is...This was
definitely a disappointment, but one of those movies that you see just to
say I saw it. I give this movie a 4.5star out of 10.
