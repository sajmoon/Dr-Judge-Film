This movie was way too over the top.  All the mystique that the MIB agency
had in the first was lost in this one.  I mean, there was a Burger King in
their central terminal thing, come on!  The only part that seemed to
maintain the quirky mystique from the first film was the beat boxing post
office workers, that was truly clever.  Frank the dog, however, was
irritating and unfunny; seeing a dog in a suit singing I Will Survive
doesn't make me laugh!  Normally, I'm a big fan of special effects, but not
in this case.  The effects were plentiful and all horribly done.  Jonny
Knoxville's character looked especially bad with the neck moving in the most
unnatural way possible.  The subway scene *could* have been good, but that
too was ruined by bad special effects.  I just gave up once the cars and
spaceships started flying everywhere, but I'll bet all the kiddies got a
kick out of the PS2 controller Wil Smith used to fly the
car.<br /><br />I wish the writers had looked to the MIB cartoon.  That cartoon had better
plots, better acting, and better effects than MIB 2 did!  It didn't try to
turn quirky dead-pan into goofy &quot;Fresh Prince&quot; one liners like this film
did!
