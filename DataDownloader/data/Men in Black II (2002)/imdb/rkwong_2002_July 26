As someone who laughed only intermittently during the first movie, no one
was more surprised than me when I found myself enjoying MIB2 the entire
way
through. The first movie never quite seems to find a consistent comedic
tone, lurching from slapstick (pinballing through HQ) to darker stuff (the
Edgar-suit and any number of casual killings) and back again. In separate
movies these bits might be funny; placed side-by-side the transition is
jarring, and they tend to cancel each other out.<br /><br />MIB2 finds a much better balance, deploying its humor with a steadier
hand.
And as a sequel, it works. The villains I didn't find particularly
memorable, but they get things moving. Jokes and plot developments that
refer back to the first movie aren't simply recycled, they're grinningly
sent up (with the exception of the final visual joke, which adds nothing
new
to its predecessor). New laughs are in plentiful supply. The
backwards-clues
part of the story is neatly done, and the big twist nicely executed. Best
of
all, Jones and Smith, despite the changed dynamic between their
characters,
somehow top even their incredible chemistry from the first movie. That
alone
is worth the price of admission.
