The first half of the movie had some good bits but I swear the dog had all
the good lines.  The second half will make you want to see the first half
again.  Could have been great, but turned into way more computer generated
special effects than I wanted to see. At times, I wondered if Smith and
Jones were also computer generated.  5/10
