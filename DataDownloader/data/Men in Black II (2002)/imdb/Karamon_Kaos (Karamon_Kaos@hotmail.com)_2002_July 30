Hi all,<br /><br />I will not write too much except to say that I thought the story was sadly
lacking in MIB 2.  I did enjoy the first one due to its originality but the
sequel just felt tacked on and rushed in an effort to steal our hard earned
movie dollars.<br /><br />Mixing slapstick with the occasional violent moment also doesn't work to
well with me.  I won't mention particular scenes in case you haven't seen
the movie yet but I found this film disappointing.<br /><br />The funniest scenes seem to come from the dog disguised alien - even Will
Smith and Tommy Lee Jones seem to be acting on autopilot most of the time.<br /><br />The villain didn't do much for me either - completely unconvincing - Lara
Flynn Boyle should probably stick with 'The Practice'.  The climax seemed
to
happen very quickly and I got the feeling perhaps the studio was running
out
of money or wanted to get it released quickly.<br /><br />Umm - one word sums up this sequel...<br /><br />Unnecessary.
