2003_May 9 

This movie is the sequel of course to the hit movie &quot;Men In Black&quot;.  I gave
this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it
a five).  This movie is short.  I mean really, really short.  There is a
short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the
short got more laughs than the movie I think).  I went to this movie knowing
how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit
unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater.  There was
no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the
opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.  The story has
Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle
an alien threat.  For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this
one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle.  Then there is the
pug dog.  I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was
funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel.
 Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had
looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again
his character's role is small and underused.  So all in all this is an
inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from
getting bored.  If they ever make a part three, please let them get a
director who is capable of making a movie.
