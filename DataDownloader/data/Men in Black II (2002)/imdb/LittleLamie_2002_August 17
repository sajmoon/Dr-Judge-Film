What was all of this about?  They spent 97 Million on this movie!
That was too much money to waste and where did it go?
I loved Lara Flynn Boyle... but Rosario Dawson (again) was
just there for decoration.  She looks like she is out of place and
she stares most of the time.
Will and Tommy are amazing.  They can't go wrong.
