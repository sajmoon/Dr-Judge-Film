This movie was just okay.  It just didn't have the charm of the first.  The
first part of the movie was definitely missing something, I know, Tommy Lee
Jones.  The greatness of the first was the chemistry between the two actors.
 This one didn't start until Tommy Lee came on the scene.  However, it was
enjoyable to watch &amp; would be good for kids.
