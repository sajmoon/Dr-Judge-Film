2002_August 6 

**<br /><br />Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Rosario Dawson, and Lara Flynn
Boyle.<br /><br />As Will Smith's video says, &quot;We're back in black, and back bringing the
heat,&quot;  Well apparently it's not a good heat.  If you thought the most
highly anticipated sequel of the summer is rather a dud.  It really doesn't
have any funny parts and is mildly tense.  I don't know about you, but Lara
Flynn Boyle is very sexy, but she isn't as good of a villain as Vincent
D'Onforio.  The movie, if you don't know what its about yet, is about an
evil alien who wants something that only K know where it is.  Big problem, K
was neuralized.  So it is up to J to find K, deneuralize him, and save the
world from the scum of the universe...again.  The movie, with a whole lot
more effort could've been the summer's funniest.
