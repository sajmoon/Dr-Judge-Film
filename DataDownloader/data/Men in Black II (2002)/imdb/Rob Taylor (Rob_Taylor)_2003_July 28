Yes, it's sequel time again! I finally got around to watching this recently
and I have to say I think I've found the perfect way to enjoy any movie.
First, you have to listen to all the negative reviews of the film, then go
and see it. You'll be expecting something so dire that the reality will be a
pleasant surprise, nay, even enjoyable. Such was the case with
MIB2.<br /><br />That said, though, this has to be one of the most blatant &quot;let's redo the
first movie&quot; sequels that I've ever seen. <br /><br />Let's recap...<br /><br />In the first movie the MIB have to recover the &quot;galaxy on Orion's belt&quot; or
the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a morgue
worker who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the
MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car
flying.<br /><br />In this sequel the MIB have to recover the &quot;light of Zartha&quot; or the Earth
will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a waitress who
falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a
showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car
flying.<br /><br />You begin to get the idea? This isn't so much of a sequel as a blatant
remake. The Italian Job remake is more different from its original than MIB2
is from its predecessor.<br /><br />Having got that out of the way, the film still manages to amuse, though
there are moments where it does make you groan rather than laugh, the jokes
being so predictable. But still, it has its moments. Frank the Pug is one of
them. There's also more screen time for Tony Shalhoub's &quot;Jeebs&quot; character
this time around, though there are only so 
many times you can see his head explode and grow back before it gets
stale.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones seems to be totally bored this time around. One wonders if
he was dragged kicking and screaming  back to the set due to contractual
obligations. His usual deadpan delivery really did look as if he wished he
were dead. <br /><br />Overall though, nothing spectacular. I have to say that I'm finding it
increasingly difficult to feel any sympathy with Hollywood studios over
movie piracy when they churn out such blatant money-spinners as
this.<br /><br />Never mind. Let's just hope there isn't a MIB 3!
