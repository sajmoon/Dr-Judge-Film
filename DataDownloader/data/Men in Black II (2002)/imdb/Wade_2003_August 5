I enjoyed Men In Black but this sequel to it is a disaster. At not one
point
of the movie was i interested and i was just waiting for it to end. This
is
by far Tommy Lee jones's worst films and one of Smith's worst films.
Johnny
Knoxville and Lara Flynn Boyle should never be bad guys in any movie. I
give
this movie two big thumbs down.
