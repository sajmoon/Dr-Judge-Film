Men in black2 is a another example of the narrow mind thinking from
Hollywoods big boss.<br /><br />The first film, it was GREAT. Lots of gags, action pack, not too much
special effect to spoil the film but enough to keep the audience happy.So,
surprise surprise, the bigfish in hollywood decided that if the first film
is a success, let throw money money in and make a sequal. One problem
though..... the MEN IN BLACK II is terrible!!!!!<br /><br />What's wrong,with it you may ask? well firstly the trailer for the film is
suppose to tempt the audience to go and see the film, NOT to show all the
gags of the film. Quite frankly, all you need is to see the trailer and
you
have almost seen the film. Why do we need to pay &pound;5 to go to see the film
again? Also there are too many out of the world special effect that kinda
spoil the film. For example, the sence where &quot;Z&quot; was talking to the baddy,
and all the sudden, he become the next jackie chan doing moves that can
only
appear in the matrix..... WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM????? Also as always,
some part of the film don't make sense. Lets name 2 of them.... First of
them, in the first film, i thought &quot;k&quot; had asked Jake Jeeves (the stolen
watch dealer) to leave the planet or he will shoot him. So why is he still
selling watch, put himelf on the intenet? Another one is the when &quot;K&quot; and
&quot;J&quot; need some weapon, they went back to &quot;K&quot; old house? Since &quot;K&quot; had left
the services and was not expected to come back, why would the weapons
still
there? shouldn't the MIB had collect it back??<br /><br />All in all, a film that you may want to go to see onl;y if you had nothing
else to do.............<br /><br />Sorry
