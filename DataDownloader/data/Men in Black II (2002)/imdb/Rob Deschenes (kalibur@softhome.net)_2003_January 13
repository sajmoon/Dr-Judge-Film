After hearing the blasts from the paid critics and the user comments, I
avoided MIB II like the plague. But after a brisk dodge from watching it at
Christmas, my buddy unceremoniously picked it up for the weekend, along with
40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS, because his fiancee could watch these type of movies
with us. Oh joy. But thankfully, MIB II was tolerable, recycling 90% of what
we already liked from the first movie, taking that &quot;extra&quot; step, being more
of this and more of that and offering little more. In short, it is just a
regular sequel.<br /><br />The world is in mortal danger again and Agent J is sent to retrieve his old
partner, K, since he can save it ... of course.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the locker in the train station, hands down. I
woke up and laughed then. Everything else is mere eye candy or mild musings.
If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy the second. Not as bad as Hades but
hey, if anything can keep the kids occupied ... otherwise I would recommend
anything else.<br /><br />
