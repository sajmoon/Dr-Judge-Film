Not good, a puny copy of the first one. Sorry guys and girls. Yes men in
black are cool, this movie is not. The story is thin, very thin. The
effects
are noting impressive. The only thing lifting the movie is Will Smith as
agent J, but any movie with Will Smith in it would probably give the
audiance some laughs.
