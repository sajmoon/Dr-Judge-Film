This is one of the many movies that made 2002 a forgettable year in
movies.
Both actors Smith and Jones should rethink this garbage without a even
thinking about a third one. There really is no plot so I can't really tell
anyone what really happens besides having people trying to be funny and
pointless action. Overall no stars.
