The success of the first MIB gave the sequal a huge standard to live up to.
One would think that with the returning cast, it would put up equal if not
better numbers at the box office than it's original. Well...it hasn't put up
the numbers...and for obvious reasons. Smith and Jones are back together as
agents J and K. However, while the two kept the laughs coming in the first
MIB, they can't help a poor script and a weak supporting cast. The only
thing that truely returns to form in this sequal is the special effects,
which at certain points in the movie, out-do the effects of the
original.
