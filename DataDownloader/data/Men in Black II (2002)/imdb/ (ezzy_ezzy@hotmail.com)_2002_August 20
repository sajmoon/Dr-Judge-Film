Whats so funny about a man old enough to be my grandad runnning around
with
shades on, damn this film is poor, im sick of the alien effects, im sick
of
tommy lee jones im sick of the whole concept of men in black, the film
isnt
funny the story is crap, need i go on, why make a sequel to a film that
wasnt that good in the first place. aww im just angry that i wasted my
last
&pound;5 on a rubbish film, ahh well you probably disagree, thats life i
guess
