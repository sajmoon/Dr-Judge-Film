Funnily enough MIBII wasn't the crap-o-rama I was expecting. It sure
isn't
going to win any oscars, but it isn't as bad as its made out to
be.<br /><br />There are a few decent gags in here. A few made me laugh out loud. They
were
usually the more understated ones as the big, obvious ones were a big
lame
(the michael jackson bit was a arse clenchingly unfunny).<br /><br />The plot concerns some bad alien looking for something that was supposed
to
do something, which the MIB were supposed to have got rid of but never
did.
Ho hum. And the only way to do it is to rescue the 'buddy' formula that
worked so well in the first film and ditch Linda Fiorentino as J's
partner.
In the most hideous way. We sit there wondering what happened to her for
like 20 odd minutes and all we get is 'you cant keep neuralizing your
partners, J' 'She wanted to go back to the morgue'. A single line. Poor
woman.<br /><br />Speaking of poor women, J's new love interest, who may or may not be K's
daughter, he doesn't seem to really give a crap, is in the film for a
grand
total of about 2 minutes. And she is the pivotal plot device.<br /><br />Anyway, K makes a return at about the 40 odd minute mark which gives him
about another 40 mins to get his thang back. This means TLJ's glowering
and
scowling like he just sniffed a turd for about 35 mins, before he mellows
at
the ending. He just does nothing. He spends 20 minutes claiming he isn't
an
MIB and then another 20 being boring. He seems to substitute deadpan for
morose (acting like you do when you are a kid and forced to visit your
gran)
losing all the spark he and Will Smith had in the original. Speaking of
Will
Smith his character goes from Ultimate bad ass MIB agent to Ultimate
Jackass
MIB agent when K shows up, just to get the 'rookie' thing going. Which is
anoying.<br /><br />All the ingredients are there from the original, but just don't click.
There
are too many plot holes, too much contradiction and not enough
characterisation. Its like how George Lucas has forgotten what made star
wars so good, Sonnenfield seems to have stuck to the blueprint but gone
wrong somehow. Maybe it would have been better if he wasn't so fervent
about
his magic '90 minute mark' for films. If we had an extra 15 odd minutes
it
could have been so much different. Maybe he would have had time for a
decent
ending...<br /><br />Actually, reading back, I enjoyed this less than I thought I did. How
strange.
