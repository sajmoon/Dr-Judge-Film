Men in Black was original, amusing and fun. Men in Black II could not be
original so it relied on in jokes and set pieces - fair enough. It works to
a certain extent, but why pay so little attention to the characters? Will
Smith's characterisation seemed to revolve around the fact that he liked
eating pie.
However the team obviously concentrated on the aliens and they are both
original, and in their female human form, completely stunning. It's just a
shame the script was so intent on rushing from start to finish. If they
make
a MIBIII lets hope they pay the script writers as much as the special
effects guy, oh and ditch the talking dog!
