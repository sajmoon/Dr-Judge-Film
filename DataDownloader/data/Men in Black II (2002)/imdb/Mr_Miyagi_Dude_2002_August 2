Men In Black II (MIB2) was definitely much better than I expected for a
sequel to the hilarious original MIB. But it was still a disappointment.
Tommy Lee Jones looks as though he lost his personality, and Will Smith
spends half of his on-screen time on the verge of crawling under a rock.
The
supporting cast gets worse with Johnny Knoxville rounding it out as the
lowest of the low: a horribly unfunny two-headed alien (two heads is even
worse TRUST ME).<br /><br />The plot is very reminiscent of the original which would be good, if it
made
sense. Will Smith &quot;neuralyzes&quot; each of his partners for no apparent reason
and Tommy Lee Jones hid &quot;clues&quot; for himself to solve the ending &quot;puzzle.&quot;
It
doesn't take a genius to solve this formula: FAILURE.<br /><br />The creature effects are original. So original in fact that they outshine
the dismal acting performances of our leads. The special effects are
lacking
in every way and they hit rock bottom with the &quot;flashy light show&quot; at the
end.<br /><br />Speaking of the end: it couldn't have come sooner.
