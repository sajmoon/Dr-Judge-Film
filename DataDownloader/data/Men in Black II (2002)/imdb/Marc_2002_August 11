After the brilliant MIB a sequel should have been a no brainer, they even
managed to get the original cast, director and writers back so how they came
up with this loud messy is anyones guess. Lets start with the plot, ITS
EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE. A alien menace crash lands on Earth
looking for a super powerful weapon, MIB are also looking for it and if they
don't get it off the planet blah blah blah... It doesn't even make sense
most of the time and any decent ideas are wasted. It wouldn't be so bad if
the script was packed full of funny jokes but you've already seen everything
remotely funny in the trailer and the rest are ripped off from the first
movie. The biggest let down here is the Smith and Jones partnership, Tommy
Lee Jones looks like he's thinking of how to spend the money he was paid and
Will Smith has fallen back on his Fresh Prince days. The chemistry and dead
pan humor is AWOL and been replaced by school playground jokes and product
placement (Burger King please go away), go and rent the original its much
better. 3/10
