In 1997, I enjoyed the original movie enormously and, five years later, the
boys in black are back, but this is a tired and disappointing sequel. On
paper, it probably looked like easy money: the same director (Barry
Sonnenfeld who has a tiny, non-speaking role), the same stars (Will Smith
and Tommy Lee Jones with some role reversal), and some of the same creatures
(Worm Guys and Frank the Pug have expanded parts). But, if there is a plot,
it's as disguised as many of the aliens and, if you go to the cinema as
often as I do, you've already seen many of the best bits in the trailers.<br /><br />
