Whoever thought that this movie was a ten out of ten does obviously not
share my tastes.  This is another in the long line of summer blockbusters
that figures that eye-candy will make up for any lack of plot or
intelligence (ie Star Wars II, Reign of Fire, etc.)<br /><br />The story itself is uninspired, we care about nobody, the jokes seem to
just
be repeats of everything that worked in the first film.  I guess that's
what
people want these days, fast food entertainment.  And that's what you'll
get
with this movie.<br /><br />I was surprised by the first one because I didn't think I would like it
from
the trailers but it turned out to be a fun (and funny) movie...Men In
Black
II is the disappointment I expected the first time around.<br /><br />Still, if you don't want to think and like shiny objects, maybe this will
be
the ten out of ten experience you're after.<br /><br />
