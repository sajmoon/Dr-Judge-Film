I've heard good and bad about this sequel, but I thought it was OK and
enjoyed it.<br /><br />Smith has to deneuralise Jones and bring him out of retirement in order to
save the world [unexpectedly!].<br /><br />There's the expectedly array of funky aliens -- the worms in particular --
and some good gags, especially the Michael Jackson related ones and the
postal workers.
