My Take: Not as wildly enjoyable as the first, but makes a terrific
sequel. <br /><br />Summer movie sequels are usually the victims of the &#x22;sequelness&#x22;. Most
sequels to big blockbuster hits tend to simply repeat the success of
the first film, and simply recycle the formula of its predecessor. MEN
IN BLACK II (or simply MIIB) is no exception. It practically repeats
the formula of the first film: Aliens are out again, J (Will Smith) and
K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back as partners to fight against it and the
whole lot. The formula is copied, but the same cannot be said about the
rest of the film. There are new rabbits in this same bag of tricks.
Although most innovations are of special effects, MIIB provides some
new fun moments in a somewhat formula approach.<br /><br />Like said, MIIB returns Smith and Jones as the dynamic duo out to stop
an alien, a creature called the Kylothian, who takes the form of a
lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), who, guess what? Trying to take over
the world. of course. This is nothing new in comparison. It&#x27;s mostly
just a retread of the previous film. But few of these &#x22;been there, done
that&#x22; sequels are fun in a different way. This one is, and it&#x27;s
actually surprisingly entertaining. The new script by Robert Gordon and
Barry Fanaro contains a number of effective puns which elevates the
humor from other formula sequels.<br /><br />Of course, there are new and colorful special effects from mostly the
same crew of the original film. The effects by effects house Industrial
Light &#x26; Magic and make-up artist Rick Baker are still outlandish and
imaginative. They still give us a host of aliens and creatures that we
can feast our eyes upon. Not much imagination went to the storyline and
characters, but a lot was certainly invested upon the effects and
visuals. Kudos for director Barry Sonnenfeld, production designer Bo
Welch and much of the special effects crew for providing a colorful
atmosphere that bursts with liveliness in an otherwise formulaic
episode of summer sequel season. It&#x27;s the same old thing, but with new
fun.<br /><br />Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.
