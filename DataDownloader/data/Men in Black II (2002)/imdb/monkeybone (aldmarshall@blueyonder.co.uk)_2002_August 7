Set five years (why is it always five?) after the first Men In Black, Agent
J (Will Smith) has now been working in New York helping to keep the aliens
under control. He is also getting through partners at lighting speed.
However, he soon gets a chance to work with an old partner again in the form
of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Unfortunately, he is now working as a postal
worker who has no memory that he was once working for the highly secretive
organization known as the Men In Black. It is down to J to get K back to the
MIB HQ and to get his memory back as he is the only person who has the key
to save the Earth from the new alien threat.<br /><br />It is common belief that if a formula works to repeat that formula. Trouble
is, when it has been done once it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going
to work as well the second time round. This seems to be the case for MIB II.
There are some familiar faces from the first film who have much more
deserved screen time. Remember the pawn shop owner who had his head blown
off, or how about the worms and Frank the Pug. Only trouble is there is
nothing really new about the film in the fact it is just basically a repeat
of the first with a few extensions on things that we've already
seen.<br /><br />Men In Black II is a disappointing shame as it wastes two superb actors in
the shape of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith who look plain bored and just
want to get it out of the way. <br /><br />On a more technical note, the film is superb with some great special effects
on display which keeps you watching to see what those wonderful boys at
George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light + Magic) are going to come up with
next.<br /><br />To finish off on a brighter note, the film does have its' funny moments and
will put a smile on your face with the Frank the Pug stealing the show.
