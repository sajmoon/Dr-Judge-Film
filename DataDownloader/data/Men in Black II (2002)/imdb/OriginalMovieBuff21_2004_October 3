Men in Black II was a boring and unfunny film from Barry Sonnefield.
The first Men in Black was good and actually made me interested into it
and waiting for its sequel but when I watched it I just got bored. It
was as same as the first film and all the new characters were bad and
there costumes were stupid. The acting wasn't good either and the
dialouge was horrific. Will Smith as usual is there to come and save
the day like all the rest of his movies, blah blah blah blah blah. I
thought the film had some funny parts by Tommy Lee Jones mainly, but it
still just got me unintersted in it. That was it<br /><br />Hedeen's outlook: 5/10 *+ D
