Which means -<br /><br />It isn't supposed to be serious.
It isn't supposed to make sense.
It isn't supposed to be serious sci-fi.
It is supposed to entertain.<br /><br />It's not the best movie out there, granted (although I found it A LOT more
enjoyable than &quot;Episode II&quot;). It's not the sequel I expected to see (Agent K
is very subdued this time). And it isn't as imaginative as the first time
(probably because shock value is a one time trick). But it's entertaining, a
bit disturbing (watch out for the closing scene - it tops the first one's
ending), funny (Frank dressed up as an MIB agent is one of the funniest
scenes I can remember in a long time), and at parts, clever.<br /><br />It doesn't try to be a serious sci-fi film. It merely seeks to entertain.
And I was entertained for as long as the movie lasted.<br /><br />Again - it's not the sequel I expected, but it's not as bad as many of the
comments say. And yes, I do think it's a lot better (as far as entertainment
value goes) than &quot;Episode II&quot;. Big surprise, huh? :)
