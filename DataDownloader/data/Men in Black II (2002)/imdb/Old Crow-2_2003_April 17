Men In Black was a well-made and hilarious comedy that truly deserved its
blockbuster status. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith had great chemistry on
screen and the duo provided numerous laughs. Due to the movie&acute;s huge success
a sequel was guaranteed and last year MIIB came out. I didn&acute;t see it in a
theatre since I believed the reviews I read were correct. I decided to wait
until the movie comes out on DVD and I&acute;m glad I did because MIIB is quite
disappointing, considering all the talent involved.<br /><br />The best thing about MIIB is naturally the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy
Lee Jones. They are one of those great buddy pairs of cinema. Both Jones and
Smith are talented actors with great comic timing. The reason why MIIB fails
is its script. It does have its share of laughs, but you can&acute;t help but feel
a bit cheated after watching this movie. The only reason why this movie was
made was money, the studio simply wanted to cash in. Since this is movie
business it&acute;s okay, but for God&acute;s sake, they should written a lot better
screenplay! MIIB has a very short running time which reveals the fact that
the writers didn&acute;t have that many good ideas to work with.<br /><br />MIIB is a typical disposable item from Hollywood and a good example
of
sequels meant purely to cash in. Entertaining? Mildly. Memorable? Far from
that. Worth renting? Judge for yourself.
