<br /><br />Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all year. A few chuckles
here
and there but no real laughs, and no real plot. Just a rehash of the
first
one. And it's a prime example of people trying to cash in on the success
of
the first movie.<br /><br />If you want a funny and original movie just watch the first one again. I
give it * out of four stars...
