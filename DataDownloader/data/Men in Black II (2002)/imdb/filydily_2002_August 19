2002_August 19 

I didn't see the first one until it came out on DVD and I wish I had
waited
again this time.  This is quite an entertaining film but I would not class
it as a comedy, when I saw it in the theatre there were only 2 people
laughing out loud (it was filled to capacity) and I think I only chuckled
a
couple of times.  The only funny gags were shown in the trailer, and the
talking dog is over used.  The first film is slightly better than this
one,
but I didn't realize that was a comedy until someone told me (I'd class it
as very light hearted adventure). The action is not very exciting, apart
from the section with Jeffrey, the rest is pretty mild. I was never bored,
or wanted to walk out, this is all I can say in favour of this film.  Will
and Tommy play their roles very well but they are let down by a poor
script
that feels like a re-write of the first film. Wait
for this to come out on video/DVD and then hire it out.
