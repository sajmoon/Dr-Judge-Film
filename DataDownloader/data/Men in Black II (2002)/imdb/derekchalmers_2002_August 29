2002_August 29 

I saw this last night with my kids who are 7 &amp; 9.  I think this is the age
group the film is aimed at.  I really enjoyed the originality of the first
film (even on second 'pre-sequel-refresher' viewing) but I found this
movie
to be pretty dull and I was glad to get out the cinema.  The kids liked it
so not a total waste of money.
