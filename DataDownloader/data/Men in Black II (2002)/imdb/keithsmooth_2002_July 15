What happened?  How in the world can a series suffer from &quot;SEQUEL FATIGUE&quot;
after one sequel.  I know, I know, it's not the first time THAT has
happened.  MIB was one of my favorite movies of 1997.  Will Smith and
Tommy
Lee Jones had great comedic chemistry (who knew?) that has somehow
evaporated.  Jones looks bored and Smith is trying his best but is
ultimately let down by a very uninspired plot.  MIB was not a great movie,
but it made so much money because it was so much fun.  Part X-Files
spoof(the show's popularity was at its peak) part Ghostbusters the movie
was
unique because it featured a hilarious talking dog, a guy who could grow
his
had back after having it blown off, a woman who gave birth to a squid,
heroes in the most ordinary-looking suits who never lost their cool, witty
dialogue, and one of the most bizarre villans I have ever seen.  Well,
MIIB
is a carbon copy of the first.  Except for the part about the witty
dialogue, the villain (Famke Jenssen has got to be happy she jumped ship),
it being unique....oh what the hell.  I hope everybody involved enjoys
their
fat paycheck.  Based on the bad reviews bad word of mouth and a
spectacular
second week freefall at the box office, I'm guessing the studio exec who
even mentions a MIIIB will be neuralized.  Come to think of it, after
seeing
this movie being neuralized doesn't sound like a bad thing. 5 out of 10
