First of all I'd like to say I really loved Men in Black. I loved the
concept of the movie, the special effects where pretty good, it was funny
and both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones kicked ass. It was downright
entertaining.<br /><br />So I expected something similar. In that I wasn't disappointed. The main
problem of this movie is that it's _too_ similar. Everything that made the
previous movie a good one is back but unfortunately that doesn't
necessarily
make this incarnation as good as the previous one. The dude in the pawn
shop
is back (although in a different role), the noisy cricket and the
space-car.
All things from the previous movie, plus a couple of new ones (why does
there always have to be a new partner in a sequel, I mean seriously, a kid
would have been worse but the dog kinda didn't do it for me either) were
cranked in less than 90 minutes of movie which results in a story which is
confusing despite the fact it would fit on the backside of your movie
ticket.<br /><br />There are a lot of different movies that _do_ rock. Go see Signs for REAL
Sci-fi, Eight-legged freaks for REAL monsters (that splatter nicer as
well)
and 51st state for a hero that REALLY talks trash.
