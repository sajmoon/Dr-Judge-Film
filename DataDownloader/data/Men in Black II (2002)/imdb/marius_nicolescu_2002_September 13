Not the best film I've seen, not the worst. I may say though, that it didn't
worth the money I've payed at the cinema. Will Smith was the best actor in
the film and I may say that the rest weren't so brilliant.
The plot was absolutley pathetic, and now I reliza that 7/10 is still a big
grade for the movie. Yet, I hade some fun watching it, just for the sake of
it.
