Once again, Agent J (Will Smith) needs Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) help on
his latest case, but the problem is Agent K is retired and henceforth
neurolized. This means he doesn't remember anything about working for the
Men In Black. So after recovering most of his memory by the deneurolizer,
they set out to stop the evil Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) from taking over
Earth, or ruling over all aliens or something, it's not like plot really
matters here. Although it's not the most intellectual movie of the Summer, I
have to admit I found the whole thing very amusing, and quite hilarious.<br /><br />I give it orange.
