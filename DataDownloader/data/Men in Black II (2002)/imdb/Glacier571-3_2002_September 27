This sequel that was five years in the making again stars Will Smith as
Agent J, who, after losing his new partner, Agent T (Patrick Warburton),
looks up Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), now working at a post office with no
remembrance of his alien-fighting past. On the lam is a pizza
deliveryman-eating seductress disguised as a Victoria's Secret model (Lara
Flynn Boyle), plus her two-headed cohort (Johnny  Knoxville). It's believed
that the cosmic beauty possibly has a checkered past involving K and J's new
crush, Laura (Rosario Dawson). Due to its short running time (a lean 88
minutes), &quot;MIB II&quot; is  uninvolving and badly rushed. There's no time for
essentials such as character development because it was apparently more
important to have Frank the Pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) upstage nearly the
entire cast, though he does provide some of the film's few laughs courtesy
of a humorous rendition of Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive.&quot; But aside from
that, there is none of the spontaneous humor from the first film, such as
Smith's hilarious entry-exam scene. Director Barry Sonnenfeld once again
makes a cameo appearance, as does Michael Jackson (yes, the Michael Jackson)
in a pointless bit part. Smith hams up his role by bouncing around the
screen like a kid in need of Ritalin. He and Jones, as usual, have great
chemistry on screen and complement each other well, which is quite possibly
the only saving grace of an otherwise average flick. &quot;MIB II&quot; warrants
watching just for the humorous sight of Jones in a U.S. Postal Service
uniform.  7/10
