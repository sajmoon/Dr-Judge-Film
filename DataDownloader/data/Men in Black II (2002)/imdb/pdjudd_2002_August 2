I knew coming in to the movie that it was not going to be the best comedy
sequel ever released but I admit that I was surprised to say the least. 
True the story isn't all that complicated but who cares?  Barry Sonnifield
changed the whole plot when he did the first film, and judging from that
alone the plot isn't supposed to be all that good.  I admit that jokes were
re-hashed somewhat and it had a lot of eye candy in it but overall there
were a lot of really funny jokes (my favorite was the alien civilization
living in a locker with the adult bar being the big attraction).  I laughed
through the whole thing.  One disappointment is that Sonnifield was
obviously relying on big name stars for attraction.  Patrick Worburn was
mentioned big in the credits even though he was in the movie for maybe 5-10
minutes.  Otherwise it was a lot of fun.
