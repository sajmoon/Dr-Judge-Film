If you liked the frist MIB, you should like this one. It is full of the
same
types of jokes and charaterization. Now, some may think that is a bad
thing
but I loved it. you should, however, watch the first one first, so you
understand some of the jokes.
A big percentage of the first movie's greatness is Will Smith's
charachter,
and that is no diffrent in this one.
So if you enjoyed the frist movie, the second is recomendeed.
