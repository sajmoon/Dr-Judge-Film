I was really eager to see MIB2, even avoided any trailers. So yesterday
four
of us went to see it.
Well, this must be the most disappointing sequel ever. There was *nothing*
in it except for light and mostly stupid fun. The dog definitively had the
best lines. Jones and Smith looked and acted as if it was only the
rehearsal.
There was no spirit, no real story, no real wittiness building up
throughout
the whole movie. Even many Special Effects where simply bad ! The ending
is
incredibly dull, repeating the one of the first movie (which was cool)
just
on a smaller scale. It looked...thrown in.
The movie felt like a cup of coke after 2 days in the sun.
What where they thinking ? I mean, are the people involved in this aware
of
the piece of crap they produced ?
One guy in the cinema went to cash desk and shouted &quot;i want my money back&quot;
:) The cashier had a agonized look on her face :)<br /><br />When reading the 95% similar comments here i'm somewhat disturbed about
the
high rating, who are those people ? Extra terrestrials ? hehe.<br /><br />I gave it three stars, only for the dog.
