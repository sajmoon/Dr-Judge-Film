The original &quot;Men in Black&quot; isn't one of my absolute favorite movies, but
it's okay.  The best things about it are the sci-fi jokes and the most
inventive looking alien characters since we left the Mos Eisley Cantina. 
Well, &quot;MIB 2&quot; is one of those sequels that takes what worked in the first
movie and goes with it.  Unfortunately, that means we end up with exactly
the same movie over again.<br /><br />No, really; the EXACT same movie over again.  Right down to the plot being
about an evil alien (who, again, transforms into the first human form it
lays eyes -or whatever- on) searching for a glowy thing that the universe
depends on.<br /><br />Is it worth watching?  Well, kids will still like it, I guess.  And people
who were waiting on the edge of their seats for the next &quot;Men in Black&quot;
movie (as opposed to, say, parts two and three of &quot;the Matrix&quot;).  As for the
rest of us, all we get is a scene with Michael Jackson and some penguins
that I guess is supposed to be funny but ends up being profoundly
terrifying.
