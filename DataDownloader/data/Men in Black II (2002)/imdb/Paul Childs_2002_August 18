Saw MIB2 last night and enjoyed it, but two questions were nagging at the
back of my mind. I think maybe a large section of the film may have been
cut
for time reasons.<br /><br />Firstly, what happened to Johnny Knoxville's character. He seemed to 'just
not be in the film anymore' he didn't get caught/killed/knocked out etc,
etc. One minute he was in it as an evil henchman, and then we didn't see
him
again.<br /><br />Secondly, how did J and K know where to fly the Merc to? They had said
earlier on that they had to find the launch site by a certain time, and
then
they seemed to go straight there without showing any signs of
investigating
it.<br /><br />Anyway, the larger roles for Frank and the Worm Guys was welcome and the
above questions didn't spoil my enjoyment of a fairly average Saturday
night
out.
