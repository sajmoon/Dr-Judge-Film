If this movie had been merely the same as the first it would deserve the
same high rating docked a star for lack of originality. But it doesn't come
close. It is entirely derivative but fails in every way to come close to the
original. Everything is worse except the special effects.<br /><br /> I regretted ignoring the critics and paying to see it. Had this been made
before MIB I, I would have boycotted all movies by the director and stars.
The best thing to be said is that it is better than The Avengers or Batman
and Robin, but barely.
