Surprisingly enjoyable sequel boasting good action sequences, often
dazzling
special effects, some pleasingly funny moments and good-natured
performances
from the two leads. In a nutshell, a tentacled alien has returned to earth
to capture some wonderful light unadvisedly kept here during a previous
visit. This light will, if I understood the &quot;plot&quot; correctly, make her
all-powerful - or something like that - and only Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones)
can stop her. Unfortunately, K has been neuralised into an overly efficient
postmaster whom Agent J (Will Smith) must de-neuralise back into an MIB!
Confused? Who cares! This is all, almost unashamedly, just a vehicle for
Smith, Jones and the very latest CGI. A few of the jokes do fall a bit flat
with the - not always as sharp as it should have been - script occasionally
leaving the lead with the most screen time (Smith) just to flounder. Beyond
this, Frank the dog, the megalomaniacal pop star cameo and the &quot;worm guys&quot;
really weren't as funny as the filmmakers seem to have imagined they'd be
and we could have done without the &quot;joke&quot; which implies a forty year old
conspiracy theorist (told off by Agent J for still living with Mom)
responds
by doing her in with a shovel! At its best, however, MIIB is often
ingenious
(the clues K must uncover and follow to fully remember where the light is;
what goes on in K's locker, how to neuralise the entire city, and so on)
and
generally entertaining. Overall, this is a decent summer blockbuster which
should appeal to fans and non-fans alike (though haters of Will Smith
should
steer well clear) but will perhaps be enjoyed best of all by those who,
like
myself, haven't seen the original film since its cinema release some five
years ago. Danny Elfman's terrific score was another point in this film's
favour!
