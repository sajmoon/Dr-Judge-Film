Evil alien Serleena has arrived on Earth seeking the light of Zartha. Only
one agent can stop her, K. But he has been neuralised so it is up to his
former partner J to get him back &amp; together they can save the
world!<br /><br />In 1997 Men In Black blasted onto cinema screens from out of nowhere. It was
a great summer movie reminiscent of Ghostbusters but bringing its own fresh,
fun feel. The pairing of Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Will Smith was inspired &amp; they
are together again in MIB II.<br /><br />As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. That seems to have been
foremost in the minds of all involved with this ok if decidedly average
sequel. This movie will have an all too familiar feel to fans of the
original. Yes a sequel should retain all the good things that made the
original a hit but must also add some new ideas of its own. On this front
MIB II is lacking. The plot is almost identical to the first film - evil
alien in human form arrives on Earth seeking mysterious artifact &amp; two MIB
agents must not only stop the alien but find out what exactly the artifact
is, all within a tight time limit of course!<br /><br />Much of this film feels like it was written after market research. What did
fans like about the first film? Well lets just put all that in this one!
Characters such as Frank the pugdog, the worm guys &amp; Jeebs all make a return
here to varying degrees of success. Frank is good but the other old
characters just seem like that, lets have some new ones! Once J &amp; K are
reunited the film gets better, they are as good as ever &amp; you can forgive
the lazy plot whenever they are on screen. The banter between the two is as
good as before with a slightly different dynamic to start with. The rest of
the cast are nothing more than ok, Lara Flynn Boyle pretty much miscast as a
not very threatening or nasty alien.<br /><br />Apart from Tommy Lee &amp; Will this film is saved by a couple of good little
action set pieces &amp; also one or two really funny gags such as one locker
joke at Grand Central Station. But a film that is supposed to be a comedy
should have much more than one or two comedic highlights! FX were also a
highlight of the original MIB &amp; its a bit of a mixed bag. The CGI looks a
bit rushed but Rick Bakers imaginative &amp; skilled work is again first
rate.<br /><br />In conclusion this is ok. . . for a sequel. There have been many good ones
like Empire Strikes Back, or sequels which have taken the original concept &amp;
advanced it, adding a new dimension such as Aliens or T2. MIB II,  whilst
not a terrible film is far from brilliant. It is the rehashed plot which
lets it down, especially considering the 5 year gap between the movies. Fans
will enjoy it for some funny scenes &amp; the return of the Will Smith/Tommy Lee
Jones double act but will leave the cinema slightly underwhelmed.
