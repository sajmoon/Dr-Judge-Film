This is one of those movies where it may have been a better idea just to not
make a sequel.  I would say it's worth watching, but it's really not very
exciting or interesting, and not as much fun as the first one.  However, the
one thing that is more fun is the pug, Frank, who's a much bigger star in
this one than the first.  Aside from him, the characters are predictable and
the story pretty weak.<br /><br />I'll probably buy it, but it won't make my top 100 list.
