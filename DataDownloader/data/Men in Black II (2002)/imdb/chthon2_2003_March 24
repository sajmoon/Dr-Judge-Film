As we find out, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has had his memory wiped to
accomodate his return to civilian life.  But when an alien menace (Lara
Flynn Boyle) comes looking for some sort of light thingie, Agent J (Will
Smith) must find Agent K, the only one who knows where it is, to help save
the planet.  But when a civilian (Rosario Dawson) becomes involved, Agent
J
may end up letting personal feelings get involved with his work, something
Agent K already let happen, with bad results.<br /><br />This is an alright film if you judge it by the beauty of it's simplicity.
Films like this, when analyzed at a peice of art, just don't measure up,
but
that's really not their aim.  However, this isn't a good as the first one.
It seems more like a TV movie than a real feature film.<br /><br />Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Knoxville should never have been cast.  I have
a
feeling they got the parts for ther &quot;image&quot;, but Uma Thurman and John
Leguizamo (sp?) would have been better in those parts.<br /><br />Smith and Jones were still great in their scenes together, and I loved
seeing much of the original supporting cast back; Tony Shalhoub, Rip Torn,
and David Cross all rocked the house.  Fiorentino and D'Onofrio were gone,
but their characters couldn't have been worked back into the plot anyway.
An alright film.
