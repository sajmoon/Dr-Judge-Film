2003_March 8 

I never hated sequels as much as other people. While they do have a
tendency
to be much worse than the originals, it doesn't mean there isn't a use for
them. Some can be quite enjoyable. This movie is not one of those
examples.
The gags are either holdovers from the original or are so ill-concieved
that
they are almost painful to watch. The opening sequence starts promising,
with the purposefully shoddy remake of the landing of the princess. Sadly,
the movie recedes from that start to the viewer being relieved it has
ended.
And as much as hate the acting of Linda Fiorentino, I enjoyed her
character
much more than Rosario Dawson's. Also Vincent D'Onofrio's Bug was pure
comic
genius in his physicality. Lara Flynn Boyle's villian is entirely
lifeless.
Will and Tommy just walk through their characterizations, where in the
original they had fun defining their characters and presenting them for
the
viewer. I honestly hope Sonnefeld is done with this series. Then again a
third movie couldn't be as bad.
