hey folks, this is one movie not to miss, if you like to laugh and can
handle weird things going on! this MIB2 is way better than part one, which
was still quite a good movie too.
But MIB 2 really &quot;rocks the boat&quot;. it&acute;s hilarious, the effects are superb.
it even has a story to it!<br /><br />R.Robinson.
