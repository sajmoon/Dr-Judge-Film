As funny as the original MIB was, the sequel proves that the same old thing
can get very old and very tired very quickly. I mean, how often can you
really find it funny to watch an alien grow its head back after having it
shot off? This was a cute gag in the original (and I think we only saw it
happen once if I remember correctly.) In this one, it happens over and over
again. HEY! AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY! That's the basic
problem with this movie. It doesn't seem to have a lot to differentiate it
from the first one, with the result that it's just not that
interesting.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents &quot;Jay&quot; and &quot;Kay&quot;
respectively, and here was one element of the story that might have made
this a fun adventure if it had been developed. &quot;Kay&quot; is retired as this
movie opens, and he's been &quot;neuralized&quot; - his memory of having been an MIB
agent has been wiped clean. If the story had focussed more on &quot;Kay&quot; and his
attempts at re-integrating into the MIB agency, I think this might have been
a very funny movie. But &quot;Kay's&quot; re-integration just seems to happen far too
easily, and for the most part the focus of the movie is on Smith's &quot;Jay.&quot;
The problem with that is that I just feel Jones is better suited to the
whole MIB persona, and I felt Smith quickly became tiresome without Jones
balancing him more fully. (And Frank the dog - another of Jay's &quot;partners&quot; -
just didn't cut it. I really wanted that dog to get eaten by the big worm or
something. A very irritating character, in my opinion.)<br /><br />My advice: stick with the original.<br /><br />3/10
