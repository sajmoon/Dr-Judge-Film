This movie was fun, I think, but not as good as
the first one. Still the special effects were nice,
and it was definitely worth the ticket price. The
plot was, of course, very typical for this kind of a movie
-
nothing new there. But Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as<br /><br />actors are able to make a common plot to shine and sparkle
