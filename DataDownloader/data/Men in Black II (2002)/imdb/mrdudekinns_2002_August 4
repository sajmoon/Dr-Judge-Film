men in black hit the cinem's in 97 to both critical and commercial
acclaim!
quite rightly , taking on the old mis-matched couple , jones as the old
and
experienced agent k and smith as the new hot headed youngster agent j! the
original was a parody of 50 alien invasion movies and worked well with its
shrap wit and slick graphics!<br /><br />we start with j(smith) neautralyzing his new partner, which is a
particularly nice machine which wipes a persons memory, and k(jones)
working
for the post office in some very scary socks!  soon thanks to the
intervention of the multi snake-headed alien shapeshifter serleena (the
sultry lara flynn boyle) k and j are brought back together to reprise the
chemistry of the original.  the film is very much the same as the
original,
except it isnt as fresh and isnt as funny, it is like an identikit movie.
i
cant really rememeber laughing out loud at this movie, the odd chuckle was
raised but if the film would have gone on for longer than its poorly 88
mins, i would have become bored!<br /><br />undoubtedley the men in black will be back , at what cost to its stars and
the original?<br /><br />5
