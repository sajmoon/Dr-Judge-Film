This was definitely not an improvement over the first. The routine seem a
bit tired and I think the best jokes were all revealed in the film
trailer.
You need more than that to carry an entire movie.<br /><br />However in a summer with a dearth of good comedies, it is worth going to
see. Especially if you take the right approach - see it at the local
drive-in.
