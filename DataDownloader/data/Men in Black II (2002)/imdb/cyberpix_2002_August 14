I've quite enjoyed the first opus, but found this one disappointing,
although there are some good things (and some good girls
;-)
The F/x, especially for the big worm and the two-headed guy, where poor, and
it hasn't the fun of the first one. So... Ok, it's a &quot;2&quot;. There where some
worst sequels, but some really better.
