The original MIB was fresh, funny, and exceptionally original. This lazy
follow-up to the 1997 blockbuster tries so hard to repeat the feel of the
first film that the creators seem to have thrown all originality out the
window. Part one was full of surprises in each scene, and the chemistry
between Jones and Smith was electric. Now it feels like all of the same
jokes once more and the two leads sleepwalk for the entirety of the 80 or
so
minutes run time. Maybe they feel that they've done it all before? The
villains are totally forgettable, and the talking pug Frank (while
entertaining for a scene in MIB1) wears thin after a few moments of screen
time. Elfman's fun score is merely rehashed and uninspired. The only truly
amusing scene had to be the cameo with Barry Sonnenfeld himself (which I
won't spoil).<br /><br />MIB2 isn't a terrible film, but is not a good one either. This is all so
unfortunate, as the premise of the MIB has so much potential for a long
running franchise. Assuming that a MIB3 is in the future, hopefully the
screenwriters will dream up something original and fresh once more. In the
meantime, if you're looking for a good Sci-Fi comedy pick up the original
or
the excellent Galaxy Quest.
