The only problem with 'Men in Black II' is that it is too short.  And Tommy
Lee Jones doesn't come into the film until after the first half hour is up. 
Will Smith is great and the special effects are terrific and how can you not
love a talking dog!  I really liked this movie as summer fodder and if you
go in expecting that, you won't be disappointed.  2002 has been a much
better year that both 2000 and 2001 and this film benefits from having
director Barry Sonnenfeld back in charge and his vision continues until we
see 'Men in Black III' where I hope he will return as the man in charge.
