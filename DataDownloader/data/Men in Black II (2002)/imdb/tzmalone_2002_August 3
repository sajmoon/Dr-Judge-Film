Men in Black II may have benefited from the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise in that it
doesn't try to juggle too many new elements.  L (Linda Florentio in MIB I)
doesn't appear here which is sad, given the development of the character in
the MIB Animated Series, but probably also fortunate as screen time is
devoted to enriching Jay and Kay, the new villian---Lara Flynn Boyle,
wonderfully funny as the Victoria Secret's model look-alike alien (favorite
scene--her chomping down on a huge burger that any working model would
consider a meal for a week)---and adding TWO love interests (the gorgeous
Rosario Dawson being the one we see, alas, not frequently enough).  Frank
and the worms steal scene after scene and Rip Torn's Zed gets a great
mano-a-non-mano scene with Boyle's alien.  The scripts fun, the direction
keeps things moving and Tommy Lee Jones again anchors the whole with his
earnest, deadpan delivery.  And, oh, yeah, Will Smith's good, too (though,
he is allowed too much time to do physical schtick towards the end that
undercuts the maturation of his character as witnessed prior to Jones'
return.
