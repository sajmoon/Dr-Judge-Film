A bad sequel to a very average film.  It attempts to be a comedy but fails
poorly 
its extremely light on laughs, the most amusing lines were used up in the
trailer. 
The leading girl was very poor, not a patch on the one full of attitude in
the last 
one. Lastly the special effects were extremely bad, everything done in cg
looked 
rushed and cheap - music video standard.
