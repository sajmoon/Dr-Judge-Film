This movie was pretty good, all in all. It had a lot of funny jokes. I
think it was mostly geared toward younger people. But a few were
funny.I don&#39;t want to spoil it for anyone, so I&#39;m just going to write
in general terms.<br /><br />One of gags in this movie was so hilarious, it canceled out all of the
bad jokes and somewhat weak storyline, and turned it into a wholly
positive experience for me.I&#39;m still laughing, 2 weeks later! I am glad
I suffered through all of the painful so-called humor, just to see that
one scene.Instant classic! I found parts of the actual story difficult
to follow. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s so important, if you can realize this
movie for what it is. Harmless fun. 7 out of 10.
