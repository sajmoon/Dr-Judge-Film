This movie was about as uninventive as a sequel could possibly be.
Unbelieveably stale jokes, boring special effects, and a completely
uninteresting plot to boot.
Will Smith practically slept through this movie, showing little spark
or interest in the dialogue that he was speaking--but really, who could
blame him?  Hopefully, he will not continue to agree to take on such
drivel,
as someone like Eddie Murphy seems to do, time and time again--and look
where his career has gone.
Lara Flynn-Boyle looked like her usual frighteningly skinny self,
while
trying to portray some catty dominatrix-type of alien.  I love Johnny
Knoxville, and his performance couldn't have been more uncomfortably
worthless.  And poor Tommy Lee Jones, who looked like he was being held a
hostage through the production process.  Someone rescue
him!
And the plot, I won't even try to explain, because I don't want to
give
it away for those of you who still want to go see this movie (and I don't
want the other half of you to fall asleep in front of your computer
screens).  But basically, MIB are on the all-exciting race against time to
beat the aliens; MIB MUST FIND THE HIDDEN THING ON EARTH BEFORE THE ALIENS
DO AND KEEP THE PLANET FROM EXPLODING!!!
There, I just made the movie about as exciting as it
gets.
