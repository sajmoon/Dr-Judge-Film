Will Smith as Agent J is Hilarius. Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K is
Interesting. Frank the dog is funny. The worms are funny. Rip Torn is
historical. Rosario Dawson as Laura Vasquez was beautiful. This story
was happened at New York July 2002 an alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn
Boyle) had been a disguise of a sexy lingerie model. In the story
Serleena have ate Scary (Michael Bailey Smith) and had steel his
clothes and if Serleena had find the light then it would be the end of
the world. Whats funny that Agent J says &quot;move your bum ass out of your
moms house&quot;. Watch this movie it is so Hilarius Frank the pug is funny
watch it on DVD or you can watch the schedule on TBS.
