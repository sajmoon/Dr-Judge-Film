I enjoyed &quot;Men in Black&quot; when it came out in 1997 because it was a story I
had never seen before: a quick simple story about a secret government agency
who protects earth from dangerous extraterrestrials.<br /><br />I don't think &quot;Men in Black II&quot; was such a good idea. Yeah, OK, they got a
few millions more in their pocket, but the story was better as a
stand-alone. Now they are a pair of so-so movies.<br /><br />In MIB-2 Will Smith takes the role of the pro and Tommy Lee Jones the role
of the rookie during the first half of the story. Neither did a good job. I
thought that Tommy Lee Jones was gonna be the reason worth to see the movie,
but I was wrong. He's just not the type of actor who plays second to a Will
Smith.<br /><br />As in the first movie, the visual effects are awful but the music is superb.
This sequel is more of a comedy than the first one, you get a good
laugh.<br /><br />As one film critic said on the radio &quot;When the best part of a movie is a
talking dog, there's something wrong going with it&quot;.
