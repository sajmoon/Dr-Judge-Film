I went to this movie with the expectation that it would be better than the
first one (based upon comments from colleagues at work).  I was
disappointed.  It is not that it is a bad movie, but more that it lacked
the
cohesion and plot integrity that the first one had.  A notable example is
that although we are told that the earth faces imminent annihilation, we
are
never really sure why or how this would be carried out.. even after the
movie ends.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was that in the first movie, you feel that
Will Smith's character is smart, on the ball, but a little rough around the
edges and will grow to be a great agent.  In this movie, although he
certainly demonstrates that he knows more about all the various alien
species, he comes across as being less capable than he was in the first
movie.  I was looking forward to him being more competent, and less of a
bumbler.<br /><br />In short, the movie was entertaining and definitely worth seeing, but it
lacked the charisma and tight story line of the first one.
