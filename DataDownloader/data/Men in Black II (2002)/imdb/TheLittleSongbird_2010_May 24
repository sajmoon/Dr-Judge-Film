Just for the record, I loved the first Men in Black movie, it was
funny, original and just enormously enjoyable. This sequel is not as
good, but it is perfectly decent considering how awful some sequels
have been. The stunts, special effects are gadgetry are just
impeccable, as are the sets and cinematography, and Will Smith and
Tommy Lee Jones still make for a charismatic and entertaining duo. I
also liked Rip Torn and Rosario Dawson. The pacing is also fine, not as
fast paced but efficient enough, and the music was catchy. However, the
script does have too many weak spots(some of Smith&#x27;s jokes are somewhat
amusing though) and while the plot starts off great it meanders. The
direction wasn&#x27;t as brisk or as innovative either, and the ending was a
little too silly for me. Overall, decent sequel but not great. 6/10
