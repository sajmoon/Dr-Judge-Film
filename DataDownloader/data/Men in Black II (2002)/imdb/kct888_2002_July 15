hmmm, some audiences expect a &quot;serious&quot; &quot;intellectual&quot; &quot;intelligent&quot; plot
in
a movie about a secret government organization protecting the earth from
bad
aliens.... face it, this is not a film intended to be a cinematic
masterpiece, go rent Gone with the Wind for that.  This is a fun summer
film.  Something to go for fun and a few laughs, no matter how stupid some
of the jokes might seem.  Also, the evil babe is a total babe. I love
beautiful women in black leather!  Spank me. :)
