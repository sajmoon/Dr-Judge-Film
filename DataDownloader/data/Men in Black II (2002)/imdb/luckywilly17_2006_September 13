I strongly disagree with the &quot;bland sequel&quot; that takes up the main page
of this entry. I found this sequel to be fun and amusing. Will Smith
provides most of the laughs with TLJ backing him up well. And Lara
Flynn Boyle..... well, what can you say? Just look at her. Stunning.<br /><br />All the supporting cast are up to scratch. Rip Torn returns as the
weather-beaten Zed providing plenty of laughs, along with new MIB cast
members Rosario Dawson and Johnny Knoxville. The special effects are
first class, with more aliens and gadgets and gizmos than the first
film.<br /><br />Barry Sonnefeld keeps things moving at a fast pace.
