When the first MIB came out everyone was in a haze of the effects that had
gone into it and everyone was talking about the aliens and plot but the
second one did not live up to the standards of the original.  If your going
to go out and make a sequel, make it so that people talk about the sequel
and not think back to the original.  You want to blow the first one away
and
out of your mind.<br /><br />The same thing goes with Jurassic Park, first was good and then it just
kept
going down hill.
