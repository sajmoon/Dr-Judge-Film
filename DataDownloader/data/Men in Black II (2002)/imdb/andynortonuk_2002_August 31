I thought that this was going to be better than the first film. But I was
wrong! It's dreadful. The same plot only reversed, because Agent J makes
former Agent K into the same Agent he used. Absolutely pointless! I'd rather
see the original back on the silver screen than this rubbish! I would give
only 1 star for the film, which isn't at all original.Another star for
proving that Johnny Knoxville is not just a hilarious stunt man, but a good
actor that is sadly over-shadowed by the main roles. And one more for the
only thing good, and original, in this film was Wacko's, Michael Jackson,
cameo, were he plays Agent M who seems to be trapped with some penguins.
Don't bother seeing it, unless you want to waste your money!<br /><br />
