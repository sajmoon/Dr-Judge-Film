When I did go out from the cimena, I was almost crying. Why, before I
hadn't
seen it and I had high expectations for the movie,
And Guess what?
It was so lame with so lame jokes and so lame story. The Character in this
film was lame too (characterless). IF they make number 3 so I hope its like
the first one. With something challenging.
