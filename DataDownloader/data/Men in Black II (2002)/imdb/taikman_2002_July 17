I'm going to start this review with a weird analogy. Bear with
me.<br /><br />Films and their sequels are like meals. You can can cook them a different
way, maybe add some new spices, and it might even be an improvement on the
first dish (say, 'Batman Returns' versus 'Batman'). But if you just reheat
the original - well, you've all microwaved leftovers. That's what happens to
'Men In Black 2' - it's the same story, tasty enough but not as good as when
it was fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />Perhaps because we've been here before the film feels flat until Jones
appears. His weary, weathered face adds a bit of depth to the fun and he and
Smith do the old funny-black-guy paired with straight-white-guy routine
well. There are some nice touches in the film, such as the alien
civilization kept in a locker or the Playstation control pad in the
rocket-car, and the various tentacled, feathered, scaled and wormlike aliens
are cool. But some things are done poorly too - for instance Smith's love
interest is weak, the much more interesting woman from the first film is
dismissed in one line and the climax lacks something new.<br /><br />If you really liked the first MIB, or you are in the mood for some light
sci-fi/comedy and aren't feeling too critical, you should enjoy this. But
don't expect to be thinking about it a few days later.<br /><br />6/10
