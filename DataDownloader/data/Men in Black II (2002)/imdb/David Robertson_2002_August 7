2002_August 7 

Aside from the talking dog this film is not very funny and not very
interesting. Some of the special effects were all right, but nothing
special. It looks like the lot of them were in it for the paycheck. There
will probably be a MIII. I certainly won't pay ten quid to see it. Four
out
of ten.
