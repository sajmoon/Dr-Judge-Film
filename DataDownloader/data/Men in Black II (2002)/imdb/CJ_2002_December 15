I have seen the new film &quot;Men In Black&quot;. I think in some moments
of it the heroes are better than in the first part of this film. Of
course, I liked this film, because there was a lot of humor. I think it
was enough humor in the first one, but in the second film their
humor is more easy to understand. And I think that any
continuation of each film would be better than the last
one.
