I was awaiting to see this movie in anticipation after enjoying the
first. I will admit the special effects were very good, but the acting
came across as a little wooden. Will Smith was trying too hard to be
funny and Tommy Lee Jones was just going through the motions to act. He
was definitely missing something in his performance I thought. I must
admit I was struggling to sit there for the entire film because the
overall plot was repetitious from the first one. They tried to use the
same successful formula thinking it would be a hit too, how wrong!!!.
Never mind though, I think it&#x27;s a film more for the younger age
bracket....at least my 10yr old daughter thought it was pretty good.
