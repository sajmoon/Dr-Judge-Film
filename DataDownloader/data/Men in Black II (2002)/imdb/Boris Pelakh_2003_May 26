Since I did not bother to go watch MIB II in the theater, and
just
got the DVD out of the library, I watched my tape of the first
movie
as a refresher beforehand. This was probably a mistake, as it
underlined
what a severe decline the sequel was. With the exception of a
few
funny moments (the worm scene in the beginning was pretty good),
most
of the jokes seemed forced, as if someone attempted to recycle
the
humor in the first movie, without success. Let's hope that there
is
not a 3rd movie in the works (I can see it now, straight to video starring
Damon Wayans and Tom Arnold *shudder*).
