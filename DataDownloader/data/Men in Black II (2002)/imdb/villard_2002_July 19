This movie is OK if you want to &quot;neuralize&quot; your intellect for 88 minutes
for some mildy amusing mindless fun. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make the
movie survivable. However, it is pretty bad when a dog gets all the good
laugh lines! I found the first film completely forgettable, and this goes
the same way. Must be that neuralizer again!
