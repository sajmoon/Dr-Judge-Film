2002_September 20 

Like hundreds of films this one has followed them in that the sequel is
not
as good as the first one!  Fair enough it was funny and i laughed but it
lacked tension.  There were many parts in which i was falling asleep.  I
would recommend u go and see it just to say that u have seen it.  this is
my
view on the film but i do tend to have a specific taste in
music!!!!!!!!!!
