4.5 out of 10<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnenfeld's sequel to the popular Men in Black is a total
retread, without a whit of originality.  Will Smith once again stars as
Agent Jay and this time he's got to bring back Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones)
from retirement to help him find the Light of Zartha or the Earth will be
destroyed.  That's as far as it goes in terms of plot and as you can tell,
it's not that different from its predecessor.  The movie fails to explore
its fun premise by extending new ideas, it's basically all formula, designed
to ensure the masses will churn in their hard-earned cash.  Consequently,
boredom eventually sets in when you realize the movie almost never offers
any surprises or fun ideas.<br /><br />The movie isn't, however, a total bust.  The opening, involving a giant
alien worm, is an enjoyably wild sequence.  Will Smith's performance is
energetic and likeable and he does manage to squeeze off a few good laughs
here and there.  There are also a couple of genuinely fascinating concepts
the movie introduces, such as the miniature globe that's actually another
planet altogether and an alien race living in a train station locker that
worships the keyholder as their god.  And yes, the final scene is very cool,
and makes a good set-up for another sequel.  Let's just hope they follow
through on it the next time.
