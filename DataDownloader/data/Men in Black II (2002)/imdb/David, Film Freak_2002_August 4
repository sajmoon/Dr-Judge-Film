2002_August 4 

One of the biggest films of 2002 is of course, Men In Black II - the
super-cool sequel to the 1997 sci-fi original starring Tommy Lee Jones and
Will Smith. With a mysterious alien creature on Earth trying to find 'The
Light' which could destroy Earth as we know it, Agent K (Smith) must find
Agent J (Jones) and get his memory back, for he might be the only one who
knows where The Light is hidden. One of the good things about MIIB is
Rosario Dawson - a key witness to an alien attack - fresh from such flops
as
Josie &amp; The Pussycats and Down To You, this is bound to kick-start her
career. OK, it's not the most sophisticated of storylines and you won't
come
out of the movie feeling any smarter for having seen it, but at least,
while
you're in the movie theatre, it's an exhilirating rollercoaster ride
filled
with blinding special FX and a humourous cast with plenty of jokes. I
wouldn't say it was either better or worse than the first one, but both
are
solid sci-fi action comedies to enjoy on the big screen.
