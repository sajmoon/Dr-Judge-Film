I had seen the scene with Michael Jackson in MIIB already before, but only
today I watched the whole thing, and it was really very boring. Even part 1
of MIB was better, and I found part 1 already boring, too. Michael Jackson
was the best part of that whole movie. I hope there won't be a 3rd part. At
least for me it's enough now.<br /><br />Rating: 2 / 10
