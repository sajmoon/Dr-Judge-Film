I loved &quot;Men in black&quot;. I really, really, really loved it. It was definitely
one of the wittiest, craziest and the most successful movies of the late
90's. Movie history had never seen such an incredibly silly, senseless and
irresistible scifi action comedy before it. Every minute of &quot;Men in black&quot;
was marvelous fun. I would almost have to call it a masterpiece, in its own
genre that is. Therefore I was looking forward for the sequel and when the
wait of five years finally ended the theater called me. Unfortunately I
didn't get exactly what I was after. When someone tells you a really
hilarious joke you naturally laugh at it. When someone tells you precisely
the same joke again it's no longer that funny. This was the case. &quot;Men in
black II&quot; just seemed like it's a remake of the first flick. There was
nothing new, nothing fresh, and Tommy Lee Jones acted just like he's simply
tired and fed up with his character and he's in only because of the huge
paycheck. Even the script was somewhat confusing. Of course this movie was
very watchable and it was filled with wonderful moments and fabulous ideas
here and there but altogether it wasn't so good anymore. Still, go to
theaters and by all means watch &quot;Men in black II&quot; if you liked the first
one. Maybe you'll like this one too. All I can say is, if the sequel is ten
times worse but still ok, then how good can the original possibly be...?
Think of it.
