MIB 2 was not as sharp as the original, but then very few sequels
are.<br /><br />The fault lies not with the cast, as both Will Smith and Tommy Lee are top
line actors, as are the supporting cast, but with the script writers, who
wanted to capture the original formular, but I found the script wasn't as
sharp as the original MIB, and the story seemed to rely to much on the alien
special effects to support it.<br /><br />That said there were a few moments that made me laugh, with the worms being
the best alien characters.  The talking dog though was just irritating after
a few minutes.<br /><br />If you liked the original, you will love this, if you didn't then the film
is entertaining, but lacks the spark of the original.<br /><br />
