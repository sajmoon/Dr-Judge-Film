This movie wasn't terrible it just was'nt a patch on the original the plot
was very flimsy and just used really as a subplot between the minutes
after
minutes of CGI Special effects. Smith and Jones looked bored and
embarrassed
to star in tbis lame and silly sequel. I had high expectations for this
movie because i really liked the first movie.
I was really disappointed as were most of my friends, because the director
wrongly has forfeited a good story, script, charecterization and funny
lines
in favour of an endless stream of effects which might please under 10's
but
not a film fan as myself.
It was also fatr too short at less than 90 mins although halfway through
you'll get bored and switch off before the end anyway.<br /><br />If you liked the first movie you'll feel ripped off as it's a virual
remake
- the story does'nt move along at all apart from missing Linda
Fiorentino.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first movie you won't have a clue what's going on
through much of the movie - so watch the first one to begin with and
forget
about this one altogether.<br /><br />Either way the only people sattifised with this movie are the ones who
didn't seen the first one &amp; and therefore didn't waste they're money on
this
truly abysmal sequel.<br /><br />I've read that they're thinking about doing a third men in black - my
advice: save your careers and forget about it.<br /><br />My rating 6/10 this sequel
9/10 The first movie!
