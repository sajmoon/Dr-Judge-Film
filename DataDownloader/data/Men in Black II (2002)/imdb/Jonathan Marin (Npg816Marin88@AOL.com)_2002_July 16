I was really high on drugs to actually pay $ 10 to see this. Last<br /><br />weekend, I saw Men In Black 2 expecting to see the $ 90 million<br /><br />blockbuster it is. Instead I saw a very short and unfunny piece of<br /><br />garbage! I can't believe all of this hype was put towards this film. I<br /><br />was really disappointed with Will Smith's performance and the<br /><br />lame performance by Frank the dog. The cameo of the so-called<br /><br />King of Pop himself was horrible. It was a good thing I saw Like<br /><br />Mike the same day. That just brightened my day. Men in Black 2<br /><br />was so short. It felt like I was watching the cartoon series. People<br /><br />take it from me Men in Black 2 was stupid! Horrible! Garbage! The<br /><br />original Men in Black was on T.V. that night. I just sat there and<br /><br />said &quot;The first is always the best&quot;.
