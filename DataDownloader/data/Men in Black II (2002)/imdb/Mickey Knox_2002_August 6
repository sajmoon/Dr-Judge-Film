Sequels are never good movies. And MIB 2 is not the exception. When the
producer/writer/director cares only about money, and how to make more of
them, it can never end up good. <br /><br />After the huge commercial success of the first part, i expected a sequel. 
But how can you make a good movie, when the most important part is missing,
originality? And how can you make a good movie, when the only goal is to get
as many people in theaters as possible?<br /><br />MIB2 is just 90 mins of exageration. More aliens, more bugs, better special
effects. Still the movie fails to deliver what fans expected. The gags are
so much worse than on the first part, the plot is simply childish, and all
you're left with after you leave the theater is the strange feeling in your
mouth, that you have watched something weird. A movie with huge investments,
talented actors, that is far inferior to most low-budget movies out there.
Because, after all, movies are not all about special effects, but about
story, plot, characters, actors etc. And MIB 2 suffers in all these
categories.<br /><br />Doesn't deserve more than 4 out of 10.<br /><br />And i don't know why, but i have a feeling: MIB3 will be worse than
this.
