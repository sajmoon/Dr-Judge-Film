MEN IN BLACK II (2002)<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />--Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith again have great chemistry and make for a
terrific team. I liked the humour in the situation being swapped - Jones is
clueless, Smith is the expert. This makes for a number of very cool jokes
(old and busted - new hotness).<br /><br />--Frank, the talking dog, really stole the show. He was a hoot and a half. I
loved him wearing the MIB seat, and the hysterical sing-along to &quot;Who Let
the Dogs Out?&quot;<br /><br />--The best jokes in the movie are the ones that are intelligent and not just
humorous one-liners. For instance, the post office sequence I found to be
very clever and also absolutely HILARIOUS. The final scene in the movie was
very impressive, funny and had a bit of philosophy mixed in there
too!<br /><br />--&quot;Men in Black II&quot; shows us a little more about actually being a man in
black, other than you are an ultra-cool kick-ass alien fighter. In some very
effective scenes we get to see the loneliness that comes with this job, and
consequences and prices are always a subject I'm open to. Very cool&#133;one of
the strengths in the film other than some terrific jokes.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />--The slapstick, clich&eacute;d jokes brought down the quality of the movie
sufficiently. I didn't really like those chain-smoking, martini-loving warm
aliens; their jokes were just TOO obvious for my liking.<br /><br />--The villain of the film, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, is very stupid. I
just don't really like Flynn Boyle as an actress; I found her very boring in
the role. She just didn't sell me on being funny, memorable or threatening.
Perhaps part of the problem with her not holding up as much of a threat is
because all she does practically is stay in a building for the majority of
the movie. She doesn't have any interesting or important characters to
interact with therefore she can't say or do anything thrilling making her
one of the most dull villains of 2002.<br /><br />--There were too many plot holes in this film. I would like an explanation
as to how the baddies always get fired down, shot, burnt, but then a scene
later they appear right as rain and ready to kick ass? Also, what the hell
happened to Johnny Knoxville's rather entertaining character? He could've
made it, because one head was trying to resuscitate the other head but he
didn't get much of a send off, he just never came back. And what the hell
happened to Linda Fiorentino's character from &quot;Men in Black&quot;?<br /><br />--The final scenes of the film speed by with not much imagination, a lacking
atmosphere and a very dull wrap up in general to the storyline of the
film.<br /><br />--Too much repetition from &quot;Men in Black&quot;. The upside down car thing was
used again, and the storyline doesn't bring much new plot-wise. What about a
&quot;Women in Black&quot; story or perhaps a &quot;Spacemen in Black&quot;?<br /><br />RATING:<br /><br />7/10 - Lacking the intrigue factor of the first film, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;
still holds up as a fun comedy with a leisurely pace and some great
humour.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:<br /><br />Alien: Resurrection (6/10)
Babe (9/10)
Bad Boys (7/10)
Mars Attacks! (5/10)
Men in Black (7/10)
