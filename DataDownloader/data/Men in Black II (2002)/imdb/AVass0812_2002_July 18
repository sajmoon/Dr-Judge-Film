Ok,<br /><br />I just got back from watching MIB II and all I can say is, why did I waste
my time? I should've waited for it to come on DVD. MIB 2 picks up 5 years
after the first. This time around Lara Flynn Boyle is the baddie, who's
acting was truly worse than her character. Each of the characters seemed
lost within a world that both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith created in
the
first movie. I felt that it was totally rushed and there was no continuity
throughout the picture.<br /><br />It was nice to see Peter Graves in the film. I honestly thought that he'd
passed on, but lord and behold, he's alive and well. There were elements
within this film that I thought were good. Frank the dog was great comic
relief, and the &quot;worm guys&quot; were cool for a chuckle or two.<br /><br />The dissapointment came from the main characters, Jones and Smith. Each
seemed to be trying to find more than the &quot;light&quot;, they were trying to
find
the characters. Jones truly was not in character as &quot;K&quot; and Smith was
trying
to hard to be &quot;J&quot;.<br /><br />I truly felt that the story could've been better. The whole idea that K
was
in love with someone else just doesn't fit with his whole &quot;view his love
from a distant&quot; in the first. Barry Sonnefeld shouldn't be blamed for the
directing, the film editor should've been fed to the worm in the
sewer.<br /><br />Don't go and see this in the theatre, and if you have, build yourself a
neuarlizer and zap yourself to forget this dissapointment.
