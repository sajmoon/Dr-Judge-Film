Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones will entertain you the whole time with
laughs, action packed sequences, cool new gadgets, and classic alien
friends/enemies. Although charecters pop in and pop out (this movie requires
full concentration- no getting up to go to the bathroom!) the storyline is
good and even has a bit of thematic elements in the end, but i won't go into
that. This film has major action and will please all movie-goers!
Rating: 9 out of 10
