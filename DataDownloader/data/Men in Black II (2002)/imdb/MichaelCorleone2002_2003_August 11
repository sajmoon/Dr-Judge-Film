I saw this movie, aware of all the bad reviews, with the optimism that it
may be enjoyable.  Unfortunately it wasn't.  There were good visuals, but
that was what they put more time into, as opposed to story and
characters.<br /><br />The basic plot involves Jay (Smith) bringing back Kay (Jones) to help
investigate Serlena (Boyle,) who is out to get the Light of Zartha.  Good
luck trying to decipher more than this.  It's bogged down with clumsy
dialogue and an over-emphasis on Frank the Pug.  In the original, Jones'
straight man played greatly off Smith's flamboyant character.  Now it feels
like they're squeezing the last drops out of these characters.  MIB2's
script isn't nearly as clever as the original, aside from one cameo, but
this cameo could be declared obvious by some.  The major twist at the end
doesn't make any sense either.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie made to make money off of a familiar name. 
Unfortunately they decided that was all they needed for this
movie.
