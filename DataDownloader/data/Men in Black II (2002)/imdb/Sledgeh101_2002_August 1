I'm going on the assumption here that you saw the first MIB (if you didn't,
stop reading this now and rent it - it's a fairly good movie). Remember
when
Agent K was looking in on his wife, with that wistful smile, then stopped
when Agent J caught him and came up with the ham-handed &quot;Well, you know,
it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.&quot;
Remember the reply? &quot;Try it.&quot; I know what he felt. That's why I was happy
(along with many fans of the movie) to see the picture of a smiling Agent K
reunited with his wife at the end of the first movie.<br /><br />Well, when they wrote this movie, they must have forgotten about all that,
because this movie has about as much emotion as a Kleenex tissue paper.
They
try reversing the roles this time around, giving Agent J someone to be in
love with, but it doesn't work. It's forced on us (after all, if he zaps
her
like he's supposed to, goodbye movie), and thus I didn't care what
happened.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this movie still has some funny stuff, including a
funny role for Johnny Knoxville (okay, yes, I'm a fan, big deal!), but I'm
just glad I was able to get the matinee showing so I wouldn't have to waste
any more money seeing this movie than I had to. And at 81 minutes long (not
including the end credits), you better not bother going to the bathroom
during the middle of the movie - you might wind up missing half the
movie.
