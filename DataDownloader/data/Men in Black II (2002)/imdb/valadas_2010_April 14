Of this computer made movies with lots of the usual action and
thrilling scenes and images. But the visual and animation effects are
spectacular and very well succeeded. The gags are also very funny
indeed. The talking dog is particularly hilarious. Of course this is a
sci-fi comedy, one of the best made till then but no more than that I
mean the story is banal despite the attempt of introducing a
sentimental sub-plot there which is fairly attractive anyway. But the
action is really fascinating and can delight you during the whole view.
A special mention also to the extraterrestrial animated characters
which are very well conceived in terms of originality and
inventiveness.
