MIB2 makes for a really good summer diversion, but like many sequels,
feels
like a lightweight reproduction of the original item.  Tommy Lee Jones'
return to duty as a MIB introduced an interesting subplot that fills in
the
story behind the story.  But I was disappointed in the focus on Laura
Flynn
Boyle's wonderful looks over the substance of her mission, which was never
fully clear to this viewer.  Perhaps I was distracted by her Victoria's
Secret wardrobe!
