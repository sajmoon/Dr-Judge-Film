Well, we all know that the video game industry is making huge amounts
of money. $50 per game, as opposed to a $10 movie ticket. So the movie
makers think &quot;Hmmm, ima gunna make a movie based on a popular video
game and it'll be great! Everyone'll love it&quot; Well they were horribly
wrong. Just like the people who made video games based on movies.
(Catwoman)And we're going to see a lot more of them.<br /><br />The Resident Evil series will always have a place in my heart. the
stories of classic video games such as Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, the
game this movie is based on are butchered in this film. I really don't
like the character Alice, as she is just a Hollywood add-on to woo
people who have never played the games. She was good in the first film,
because that was an original story, set in the RE story.<br /><br />This movie, being a remake of RE3, didn't meet my expectations. The
problem was, after playing the game and loving it, I continued to
expect a lot of things from the movie. In other words, I have a lot of
high standards on sequels and movies, I want the same enjoyment i got
from watching, or in this case, playing, the original. Which in most
cases, was not satisfied.<br /><br />This movie is OKAY for anyone who has never played the Resident Evil
games, or know nothing about the story preceding the movies. If you
have played the games, I'll bet that you will be thoroughly
disappointed.
