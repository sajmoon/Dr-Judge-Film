3 words see this movie! It is 1000000 times better than the first so if
you liked the first, you will love this one. This was the best movie I
have seen in so long. now I know there are many magazines and news
papers and old guys on t.v that will tell you that this movie is going
to suck but I don't know what the hell there talking about. If you love
zombies, lickers, nemises, mutant dogs, and A lot of action and cool
funny hot characters, this movie you must see. Believe me when I tell
you this Resident Evil Apocalypse is worth you 7 bucks at the movies.
So get off your asses and see this movie. It is the greatest horror
movies out there now so go now! Believe me you will be glad you did.
