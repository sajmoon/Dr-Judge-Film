Don't get me wrong Resident Evil:Apocalpse was good but the original
was easier to understand.This one had more action and better characters
but it was so confusing. I mean one minute you think everybody is dead
and seconds later they're fine as can be. The thing about the scientist
and his daughter was just too much of an interference with the plot and
storyline. Just when you think it's going to end it does not.On parts
the film just drags!It really should have stopped during the
plane-crash but they drug it on so they can make another sick and
twisted sequel.Mabey they will just make it a trilogy.It's not a must
see but it is worth your time.
