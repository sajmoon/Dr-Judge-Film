When Resident Evil the Movie was first released in 2002, we were wowed
by probably the most successful game to movie adaption ever, even
thought all the characters were original and &quot;The Hive&quot; was a new
feature,<br /><br />But In this movie when you try to combine Milla Jovovich's character
Alice with a loosely based plot from Resident Evil 3:Nemesis, disaster
strikes, I think the movie would have been a whole lot better WITHOUT
HER, c-mon a superhuman hero and Zombie movies don't mix.<br /><br />Another thing being as a fan of the Resident Evil game series, I was
extremely disappointed in how the Nemesis character was portrayed, in
the game he's an unstopable killing machine, in the Movie he's a bit of
a puppy, I was also hoping to see the Hunters as well, they didn't come<br /><br />There is one thing they can do to save the movie: Re-release it with a
plot more tied into RE2 and 3, and also get rid of Alice
