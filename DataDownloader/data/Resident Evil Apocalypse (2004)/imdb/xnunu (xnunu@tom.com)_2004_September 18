 From aesthetics view point, Milla Jovovich's FPS style show is perfect.
I like her for facing the most horrible monsters with no fear and
hesitation. I more like her for her cool humanity revealed during
rescuing and killing.<br /><br />In this volume, Milla is more muscular, more violent, but less sexy. In
contrast, Jill (Sienna Guillory), another heroe in the game, is slim,
sexy and relatively more feminine. The two girls' clothing reflects
this point also. Jill is totally the same as in the game. Ten points
for her dress.<br /><br />This is not a horror movie, comparing to what happened in our real
life. The heroes like Alice and Jill will never be born, we know.<br /><br />Eight points for perfect action play, and not bad interpretation of the
original game.
