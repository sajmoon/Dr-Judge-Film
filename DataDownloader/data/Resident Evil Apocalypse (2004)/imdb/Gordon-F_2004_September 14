Resident Evil: Apocalypse did not have character development of any
kind or much of a plot to grab on to... but who cares? It's a zombie
killing flick. There isn't supposed to be any of that. If you want to
see that go watch the latest Nicole Kidman movie. RE was a lot of fun
to watch because it was mind-numbing. It was not supposed to be an
Academy Award winning movie. Anyone who can't see this, shouldn't see
these movies. Lots of zombies strange creatures and lots of discharging
ammo. Who cares who directed it? As long as a lot of things blow up
they can't go wrong. That's what these movies are for. It was fun.
Plain and Simple. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was a great action-packed
zombie thriller. Nothing more, nothing less.
