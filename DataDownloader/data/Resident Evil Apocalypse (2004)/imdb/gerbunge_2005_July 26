I can understand why people like this movie, but the thing is that it
carries a name, they should respect the genre or name it otherwise.
Resident evil should be survival horror, intense in gore, and despair
situations. Instead they turned into a Hollywood megaproduction Action
saturated movie. Resident evil main characters should be always on the
run saving each bullet as if it was the last one, with the only goal in
their minds is to survive the blood thirsty zombies. No Miniguns, no
Roketlauncher, no genetically engeneered hero, no choppers, no atomic
bombs! Or...at least....don't call it Resident Evil.... because it
insults its fans.
