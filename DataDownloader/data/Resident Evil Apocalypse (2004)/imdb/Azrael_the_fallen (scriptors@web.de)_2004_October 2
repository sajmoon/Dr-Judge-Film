2004_October 2 

I am a fan of the games since I played the first of them a few years
ago and I was somewhat disappointed by the first movie, but this one is
far better, though they could have made more of it! It was great
considering the game it is based on is far the worst of the series
(IMHO the first one was the best followed closed by the second one),
but it's getting more and more exaggerated towards the end (even by RE
standarts) and the ending itself is horrible.As I said before, it's FAR
better than the first (which hadn't much to do with the games and this
one at least is based upon one of them) and maybe, if they are
continuing at this rate, the next one, or the one after, could be
great, but this one as well as the first one is only for hardcore
RE-fans like me.
