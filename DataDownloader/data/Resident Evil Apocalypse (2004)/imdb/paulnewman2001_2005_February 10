Given that game-to-movie transfers are inherently poor, Paul WS
Anderson's 2002 big screen adaptation of zombie survival horror
Resident Evil was no worse than most, offering a scantily clad Milla
Jovovich and sharp production design in place of the game's
claustrophobic scares.<br /><br />Anderson wrote (or, rather, regurgitated) this by-the-numbers sequel
for Alexander Witt to direct and it's a pretty unimpressive effort.<br /><br />Picking up from the original's close, Alice (Jovovich) joins the
remains of a combat squad to fight clear of a city swarming with the
resurrected dead and facing the lumbering zombie behemoth born of the
Nemesis Project.<br /><br />There's action aplenty but the living dead are largely in the
background and when it's not ripping off better movies it's a plodding
slog.
