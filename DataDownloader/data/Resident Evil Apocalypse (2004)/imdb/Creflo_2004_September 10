...though still not as good as it would have been if George Romero had
directed. The second film seemed to incorporate more details from the
games than the first. I felt much of the action was too quick-cut
blurry MTV style, but I admit that I really felt the icy grip of
&quot;Survival Horror&quot; as I sat in the theater.<br /><br />Nemesis didn't look as much like Toxic Avenger as I thought he would
based on early production info. He was not tall enough, though, because
they wanted him to be sympathetic (ARGH!) and also on a scale to fight
Alice hand-to-hand.<br /><br />More gratuitous nudity of the delicious Mila, this time in a tank of
fluid, as well as many flashback clips from the first film. The music
features much of the same techno feel that Marilyn Manson created for
the original. Look for the producer's name on the side of the escape
helicopter and for a typo (Transportation Coaptain) in the credits, if
you're so inclined. Quick little extra bit of entertainment
during/after credits. Thank you for taking my call dot com.
