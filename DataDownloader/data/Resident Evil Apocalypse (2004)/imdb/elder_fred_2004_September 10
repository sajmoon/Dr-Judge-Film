This movie was so... awful... There is no god.<br /><br />How this even happens is still beyond my limited understanding. True,
the effects were very professionally done (as they should have been),
but do the people who make these projects happen actually speak
English? Then why was the script so bad that it hurt my throat and
inspired me to learn another language and forget this one altogether?
Did anyone else notice the swapping from day to night while Milla was
wandering the cathedral?<br /><br />Other than the fact that it was awful, I'd say this movie has a shot at
breaking some records. A rousing 3/10 for my vote (two points for the
cg, 1 to protect my credibility with the Milla Jovovich fans, whom I
hate).
