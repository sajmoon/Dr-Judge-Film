When Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) reopens The Hive, there is an
outbreak of the T-Virus in Raccoon City. The Umbrella leader closes the
gateway to the city and traps the survivals with the contaminated
zombies, and releases Nemesis to destroy the STARS members to test how
powerful this deadly weapon is. Meanwhile, Alice (Milla Jovovich), Jill
Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) try to find
Angela, the little daughter of Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) who is
trapped in Raccoon City, as the means to escape from the siege of the
city.<br /><br />Although having a kind of prejudice against movies with lots explosions
and special effects, I loved &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. This movie is
a great non-stop adventure and sequel of the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. The
choreography of the fights is excellent, the heroines are marvelous and
everything works well in this great entertainment. I do not play
video-games, but &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is among the favorite ones of my son
and my daughter, and now I can understand why. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &quot;Resident Evil 2: Apocalipse&quot; (&quot;Resident Evil 2:
Apocalypse&quot;)
