After watching the first, I thought that this sequel would be worse but
to my surprise, this sequel is actually better&#x85;but not by much. The
story is more-or-less the same as the first one (we need to get to
point A to B by this time, fighting zombies along the way) but it&#x27;s a
little more stronger. The action sequences and explosions were good to
watch but in some of the scenes felt like it was there to impress
thirteen-year-old teenagers to keep their attention. I also noticed it
follows the games a lot more in Apocalypse than it does with Resident
Evil which is a plus since Resident Evil hardly followed any of the
games. Gamers will be glad to see Nemesis, zombie dogs and Jill
Valentine return on-screen and will also be glad that the design and
make-up for Nemesis was superbly done. Yet again, Milla Jovovich was
spot-on as bad-ass Alice as was Sienna Guillory who played as Jill
Valentine and Mike Epps who added a little humour to this zombie action
movie as L.J. The characters were done well but they wasn&#x27;t done well
enough that you would care about what happened to them.<br /><br />The visual effects were done quite good and the action scenes were
executed very well, especially the scenes in the church and the
graveyard which showed great camera-work and special effects. The music
wasn&#x27;t very memorable and didn&#x27;t fit some of the scenes well like the
last movie although the theme tune was good.<br /><br />The ending in this movie, for me, isn&#x27;t much of an improvement from the
last but it&#x27;s good enough for a mediocre movie series. The start,
middle and end felt like it was going at an average pace which is a
good thing.<br /><br />Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
