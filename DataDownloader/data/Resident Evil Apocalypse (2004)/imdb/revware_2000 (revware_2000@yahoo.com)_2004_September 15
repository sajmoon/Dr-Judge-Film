I agree with the harsher critics of this film. Resident Evil:
Apocalypse is not even an entertainingly bad film. Bazooka Joe comics
have a better sense of narrative flow than this.<br /><br />Screwing something up this bad takes real effort - given that this
franchise has a ready made plot, ready made characters (with back
stories)and as fans of the game series know, ready made homage to
Romero camera set ups that aren't as jumpy and distracting as those in
the movie. It's a sad day indeed when a video game has longer scene
takes.<br /><br />I suggest fans of the genre skip this one, check out any other zombie
film they can think of, then write Anderson a letter begging him to
keep his ape-like mitts off genre films forever. Anderson might have
his talents, but given his track record this summer (A v P, RE) horror
films ain't one of them.
