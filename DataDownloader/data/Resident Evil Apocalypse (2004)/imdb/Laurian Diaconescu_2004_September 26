I really don't understand why some people seem to hate this movie. If
you're not into this genre, don't vote for it just to lower the rank,
skip it, let others enjoy it! I played the games and I found the movie
really satisfying, it used characters from the game, locations, too bad
it didn't use any of the creepy music. But it was OK anyway. On the
other hand, I think that anyone could enjoy this movie, even if they
don't have a clue that it's based on game characters. In my opinion,
this sequel did justice to all the fans who were disappointed by the
first installment. I was one of them. Not that I didn't like it, it's
just that I would have preferred other sceneries, not just laboratories,
which I find boring. The first movie didn't seem very well connected to
the game story, but the sequel really surprised me. It offered
everything a fan could desire. OK, the first half of the movie was only
&quot;ok&quot;, but once Nemesis was introduced, everything became awesome. Oh,
and I taker a bow before the creators of Nemesis! He turned out really,
really awesome. I didn't really expect that, but I surely hoped it
would come out like that :-) And I loved the fact that they added some
sort of drama to the ending, with Alice recognizing the human side of
the monster. Way to go, Sony Pictures, I'm looking forward to the
sequel! I just hope I won't have to wait another two long years for it
:-)<br /><br />Just a tip, why not use the in-game music a bit? Just a little bit? I
mean, like the creepy RPD themes and other (in my opinion)
masterpieces from Resident Evil 2 and 3? Anyway, WAY TO GO!
