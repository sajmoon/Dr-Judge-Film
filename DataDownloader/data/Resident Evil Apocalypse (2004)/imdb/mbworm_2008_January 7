&quot;Resident Evil&quot; was a scary, impressive horror film that was inspired
by the famous game. After the T-Virus broke out in the underground lab
called The Hive, the Umbrella Corporation tried to cover up its deadly
mistake. But it was only the beginning.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is back as Alice, and she&#39;s as stunningly beautiful as
ever. She is the only apparent survivor from the incident in the first
film, and now she&#39;s been tampered with by Umbrella. When she escapes an
abandoned hospital, she finds herself in Racoon City, which has been
taken over by the virus.<br /><br />In a desperate attempt to conceal the virus, Umbrella has the city
blockaded, and Alice must team up with Jill Valentine, a former
S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) officer to guide the last
small group of survivors out to safety, before nuclear bombs are
dropped on the city.<br /><br />Alice has become an unstoppable force of nature, toting guns and other
weapons. She&#39;s an insanely talented martial arts expert, and it seems
she can fight just about anything. With an awesome plot derived
straight from the second game, the movie totally misses the mark.<br /><br />The camera work is hideous, especially during the action scenes, you
can barely tell what&#39;s going on for the frantic editing is too much to
bear. Milla is strong again in her performance but other than her and
Sienna Guillory as Jill, there&#39;s barely any talent to be found in this
mess, with weakly made-over monsters that barely pass for zombies and a
ludricous pace. This is only for die-hard fans of Resident Evil, other
than that consider &quot;Apocalypse&quot; a waste of your time. The DVD really
delivers though, if you liked the movie than you&#39;ll be very impressed
by the loads of extras they threw in.
