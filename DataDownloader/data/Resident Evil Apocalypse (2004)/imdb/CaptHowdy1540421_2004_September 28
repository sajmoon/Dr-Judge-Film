Resident Evil:Apocolypse****[4 Stars]-Seems like sequels are doing very
well this year especially with this and ''Excorsist:The Beginning****[4
Stars]''. I remember Bruce Campbell referring to his movie ''Evil Dead
2**[2 Stars'' as the mother of all sequels, well that is defiantly an
understatement because this movie has to be the mother of all sequels
especially among zombie movies. Its also what I would refer to as the
best zombie movie since ''Return Of The Living Dead****[4 Stars]''.
Compared to its predecessor ''Resident Evil***&frac12;[3 &frac12; Stars]'' this one
moves at an even faster pace, adds another kickass female heroine, and
has an even better ending with more twist and turns. If you thought the
first one was fast paced action, think again, this starts right from
the Beginning with action every minute and never once takes away from
the movie's plot and storyline. As far as the female heroine Milla
Jochavich brings on another awesome ''Ellen Ripley'' performance plus
another bonus one by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine. If you thought
the ending was a big twist from the first one, this one has an ending
just as good and makes it even better by packing in even more twist and
turns.
