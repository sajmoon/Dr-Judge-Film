That's right! 'Resident Evil: Apocalyspe' is better than 'Resident
Evil' because, in my opinion, it captures more of the essence of the
video game it's based on. We actually see Racoon City this time, and
our characters actually walk through this deserted city with its creepy
cemeteries and churches. Add to the fact that the Nemisis is in it, and
that certainly helps. However, every friggin character is a card-board
cut out with extra cheese added on top. From the Swat looking guy
working for the Umbrella corporation to our hero in Milla Jovovich, who
is super-charged and strong. Yes, we see some outlandish action
sequences, where heroes arrive just in time with crazy motorbike stunts
to save the day, to doing the over-the-top by numbers death scenes.
This film is never scary or &quot;real&quot; in my eyes, and the characters are
annoying to boot. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is simply a dumb action
movie with zombies. Slightly better than the first film, but that's not
saying much as they both have the same score from me- for the sequel
not a significant improvement over the original adaption of an
excellent video game. Given the strain of Zombie films to be released
in the past 2 years, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' deserves to be ranked
well below them.<br /><br />**&frac12; out of *****!
