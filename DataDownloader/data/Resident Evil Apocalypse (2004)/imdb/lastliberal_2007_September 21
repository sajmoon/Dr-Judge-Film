I am going out on a limb here and rating the sequel better than the
original. I do that because it had way more zombie action and a lot
less sci-fi. Sorry, gamers, but I want a movie, not a game.<br /><br />Alexander Witt had scads of experience as a second unit director and
cameraman, and did a decent job in his directorial debut.
Unfortunately, he was up against some real zombie action, now (Dawn of
the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead), so the film fell short
for some. Their loss! Milla Jovovich was back and juiced up with the
virus and evolved into a kick-ass beauty that would give Jet Li a run
for his money. She is accompanied by Sienna Guillory from Love
Actually, Helen of Troy, and the Principle of Lust, and that gives us a
duo of beautiful action babes.<br /><br />Say what you will, but Nemesis was as bad as I&#39;ve seen since Robocop,
and damn ugly to boot. I haven&#39;t seen such rabid dogs since
Rottweiller; they were awesome! Like I say, this film had a lot more
zombie action and a fitting end to the jerk in charge.
