Let me start by saying, any bad reviews you've heard about this movie
is completely untrue this movie is simply AWESOME, Milla Jovovich looks
absolutely awesome in the movie she looks sexy &amp; kicks zombie bum sexy,
you'll also find Jill Valentine in this movie! she looks simply AMAZING
esp in her short skirt and slick action scenes with Alice, the Special
Effects and Action Scenes are Off the Chart, and they've tried plenty
of new stunts for the movie that will blow you away, also You'll find
Twice as many Lickers, even more Zombies, &amp; even MORE dogs! not just
that to contend with but also the Nemisis not played by the original
guy from Resident Evil 1 the Movie, but this new guy is a giant with
fast shooting rocket launchers, a killing recking machine, &amp; also he
goes around saying 'Stars' like the game, You'll constantly Recognise
scenes from the video games. This Gets 10/10 Awesome Work, Bring on a
Third, am Begging! BUY THIS MOVIE!
