This film is just plain awful. For one thing Resident Evil is not and
should not be superhero movie by any stretch of the word. In fact,
contrary to the movie the game presents the players as vulnerable and
at the mercy of the monsters. Resident Evil does not play like an
action flick that won&#39;t give time for you to breathe. The game is a
moody dark horror survival epic that has more of a link to
claustrophobia then strait to your face explosion after explosion. Much
desired atmosphere is almost never established in this movie and the
actors often appear to be just going through the motions. Oh and if the
token black guy did it for you then you probably haven&#39;t seen him in
every teen movie, sitcom, and mtv show for the past 10 years. And
seriously, does anyone remember fighting Nemesis Mortal Kombat style?
This flick was an utter joke and disgrace to RE fans everywhere.
Meanwhile, our money is being milked from us by suits and execs that
think they know what we want. Apocalypse my a$$.
