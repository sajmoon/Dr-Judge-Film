Another efficient little thriller based on the Resident Evil games.
This one isn't quite as fast and focused as the last, but it's got a
number of very good moments in it that get your attention and it does
have a good pace and good performances, to the extent one can be said
to perform in a movie that is almost entirely about running around
shooting things.<br /><br />Some people complained that the first movie wasn't much like the games.
I would say this movie is a little more like the games, at least in
places, and I think that's part of the problem. Games are structured in
a very meandering way in which you just wander around exploring and
fighting and occasionally get a little exposition, which is why I never
considered the complaints about the first movie not being enough like
the video games valid.<br /><br />Still, I had a good time. I'm giving this movie the same score as the
first, even though I didn't think it was quite as good, perhaps just
because I'm just in a mellow and generous frame of mind.
