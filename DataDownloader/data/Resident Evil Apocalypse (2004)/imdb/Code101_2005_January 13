Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the best movie-video game I ever seen.The
first Resident Evil is little bit disappointed for me.The SFX is lame
and awkward but the character and storyline is OK.However the rental
and sales for RE DVD was on top which it make benefit for the
studios.finally,They made this RE : Apocalypse with more budget than
the first RE.This movie have 100% influenced with the game from
action,screenplay,and characters.I'm a fan for resident evil games,I
played since the first release RE on PS1 in 1996.Not only the RE fans
gonna like this movie.people who is not play the game or don't know
RE,they gonna like it.because the movie gonna told to the audience
about the first happening.Don't trust any movie critic who said this
movie is bad.They just don't know cause the critic rate movie if the
movie have emotionally like crying,cheating or soap opera stuff,etc!!I
saw many movie-video game like double dragon(the worst),street
fighter(the worst),final fantasy(sleepy movie),mortal kombat,etc.This
one is very entertaining,if you have a mini home theater or big
one.This movie will wake you up all the time from beginning until end.
