I remember walking out of the original 'Resident Evil' pleasantly
buzzing but at the same time wishing, just a little bit, that a few
more aspects of the video game it was based on were present in the
film. For what it was Paul W.S. Anderson, the very same person who all
but raped both the Alien and Predator movie franchises not too long
ago, managed to craft a nifty little zombie horror film that catered to
fans of the game series and was still perfectly accessible to the
average Joe. The editing was tight, the scares were plentiful, and the
action was well staged. It's main failing, as in any overly-stylish
mish-mash of blood and guts, was its dialogue, which was stilted,
shiftless, and generally silly. But that was okay-it was fun anyway!<br /><br />In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', first time director Alexander Witt gets
the big chair while Mr. Anderson takes a step back, putting himself
instead in a producer's role as well as writing the movie's script.
Yep, that's right! The primary weakness of the first film is the
foundation upon which a completely green director is to turn a film
into a franchise. Ultimately, then, I can't really blame Mr. Witt for
the miserably stupid movie that he's made; rather I prefer to praise
him for the one star he did earn, instead of killing him for the
remaining 3 he missed out on. The fact is I would not even download
this movie. It was neither worth my money, nor especially my time. <br /><br />The set-up is simple. You've seen it before in a million other, better
films. A town is filled with zombies and a few characters need to
escape. Fewer will actually succeed. In this case, we have Milla
Jovovich's character Alice, sole survivor from the first film, walking
around barefoot in nothing but a hospital gown, eventually meeting up
with another vaguely interesting group of characters. Among these is
Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the primary heroine from the games
and who is given absolutely no set up or back-story or even much for
clothing, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), a mercenary for the dastardly
Umbrella corporation on a special mission to do something that never
gets explained, and a pimp named LJ played by Mike Epps who is there
for the racial slang and stereotypes that only a sassy, loud-mouthed
pimp can provide. Meanwhile an extremely well armed, leather clad
super-zombie called the Nemesis hunts our heroes with a chain gun and a
rocket-launcher.<br /><br />All of these factors worked in the video game (Resident Evil 3's
subtitle is 'Nemesis'), but that's the problem: video games are
perfectly justified in creating ludicrous ways to threaten the
player-as long as it's fun, it will rarely if ever be questioned.
Movies have the extra burden of plausibility.<br /><br />The first movie was half-way believable, so therefore this movie should
be, right? So why do we get a movie where armies of undead, from whom a
single bite will un-kill you, are completely ineffective against
kung-fu? I like kung-fu in my movies just as much as the next guy and I
freely admit that kung-fu and zombies are a combination I had yet to be
exposed to, but this is just ridiculous! And if the dead are coming
back to life by the legion then why, oh WHY, are they taking a shortcut
through a graveyard?! While we're at it, why doesn't anyone think to
shoot the Nemesis in his unarmored head? Oh and how did that motorcycle
ramp end up behind that stained glass window?<br /><br />Let's take a look at the teeny-tiny bright side. There are a few funny
lines, including a particularly funny reference to the Grand Theft
Auto, or GTA, series of games. The special effects are solid and that's
always nice.<br /><br />There are some nice superhero moments here and there and some of the
stunts are cool to watch. The camp value is running overtime as well,
so this will probably be a good film to invite your friends over for a
few beers with. Otherwise it's just loud, violent, and stupid.<br /><br />All said, this movie is as brash and silly as any film could possibly
dare to be. The fact that it comes from a decent pedigree in both video
games and in its prequel is only a further slap in the face to both art
forms. Paul W.S. Anderson is by no means a talented director. He is
mediocre and occasionally lucky at best, but for once I think I wish
his hand was a bit more prevalent to this movie. I hated this film.
Maybe after a lot of alcohol I could be convinced otherwise but until
then I want both my time and my money back.<br /><br />1 star (out of 4).
