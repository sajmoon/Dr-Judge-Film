Now in 2004 Alexander Witt directed a far better sequel called Resident
Evil Apocalypse. The zombie action takes place on the ground of raccoon
city. Where the town is sealed shut to keep the disease away from other
cities. Milla Jovovich portrays Alice who is infected with the T virus.
She busts in the church killing 3 lickers and saving Jill Valentine
played by Sienna Guillory. While trying to escape they meet L.J played
by funny man Mike Epps. They all meet Carlos Olivera played by Oded
Fehr (mummy,mummy returns) they run into the big motha trucka Nemesis
played by Matthew G Taylor and Alice and him fight she kicks his ass.
Nemesis blows up a helicopter and dies. She lives and everyone is
happy. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is a sequel worth watching. My final rating 7/10
