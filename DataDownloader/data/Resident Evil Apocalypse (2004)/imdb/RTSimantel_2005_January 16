If you've found yourself obeying the critics and twiddling your thumbs
through such movies as 'Lost in Translation' and 'The Hours' (yah, OK,
so they had &quot;character development&quot; and &quot;plots&quot;..hmmm, maybe that's why
they were so boring...), then treat your mind to some kick-ass action
sequences (and NO character development! I promise!) in 'Resident Evil:
Apocalypse.' <br /><br />No &quot;profound&quot; suicides over sweeping scores, no &quot;bold&quot; performances, no
&quot;life-altering&quot; themes. (Thank god). Just pure, heart-pounding sci-fi
action. Here's to Resident Evil 3. Bring it on.<br /><br />****/****
