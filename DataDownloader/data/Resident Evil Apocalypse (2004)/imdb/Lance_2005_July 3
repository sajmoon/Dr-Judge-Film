I don't know about you but I found the first Resident Evil to be a lot
of fun. And I don't know about you but I feel the sequel is a lot of
fun too.<br /><br />I will say I was disappointed on some levels. Let me go ahead and get
this out of the way.<br /><br />Gore is a problem here. And it was a problem in the first film. For a
film to be based on an extremely bloody video game I think it should
have more of the stuff. <br /><br />Secondly, there is very little suspense. That was an element the first
film had PLENTY of. But I believe this is compensated for by providing
more action sequences.<br /><br />Lastly, the zombies themselves are seen very little. And when they are
shown they often use a filming technique I practically loathe. It's
kind of a slow-mo 'every other frame' technique and it just comes
across as ineffective and distracting.<br /><br />Other than these problems this film provides plenty of the goods. We
have lots of lickers and dobermans again. It's been said that the
lickers seem to be beaten rather quickly in this flick whereas one
single one posed such a threat first time around. I have to agree with
that to an extent, but it didn't really bother me at all. I was just
glad to see lickers again.<br /><br />Tons of cool action sequences. None of it is very realistic, but why
sacrifice outrageous crazy fun for realism all of the time? Sometimes
it's best to turn that brain off and forget reality for awhile. This is
a video game movie we're talking here!<br /><br />We get a wise-cracking black guy which may seem kind of clich&eacute; but I
have to admit the man made me laugh! Some of the most memorable moments
feature this dude.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns and I can't imagine a Resident film without her.
Her character is definitely bad ass.<br /><br />Also the Nemesis turns out to be a real bad ass as well. I really liked
this character and how he'd stomp out of the darkness just to nuke
people.<br /><br />Can't wait for 3 and 4!
