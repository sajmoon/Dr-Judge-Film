I&#39;m a fan of the games who liked the first movie. But man, how I hate
this sequel. Everything that made the original so good has been either
ruined or ignored here. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is more a video game
than a real movie. &#39;That&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to be&#39; you may say. Well,
the problem is that any of the RE games has a better story, better
direction and even better acting than this boring mess.<br /><br />RE: APOCALYPSE is basically a series of unexciting and badly shot
action scenes loosely joined by a paper-thin story. There is no lack of
character development here, if only because there are no characters in
this movie, just cardboard cut-outs. The actors do what they can with
what they are given, but you never get to care much for any of them.
Milla Jovovich looks very hot again, but she seems to be sleep-walking
most of the time, in spite of all the action stuff. The rest are more
or less serviceable except for Mike Epps, who is deeply annoying as the
supposedly funny black token character/comic relief.<br /><br />If you thought Paul W. S. Anderson was a bad director, you are going to
miss him here. Alexander Witt&#39;s direction is so bad that he makes
Michael Bay look like James Cameron. Apparently, he&#39;s one of those guys
who think that an action movie must be a 90 minute-long video-clip. He
keeps using bad post-production slow-motion and awful editing
techniques to make sure that you can hardly tell what&#39;s going on,
specially during the non-stop action scenes. And just in case that&#39;s
not enough, there are moments when, for instance, tenths of zombies
suddenly teleport into an empty room to kill a disposable supporting
character.<br /><br />As I said, the plot is basically non-existent, in part because the
movie feels very choppy. The (so-called) characters keep showing up in
different locations, but we hardly see how or why they got there. We
aren&#39;t even told how some of them escaped from a church surrounded by
hordes of undead. After all, that&#39;s not necessary, because the makers
of this movie assume that their target audience is made up of people
who turn off their brains and become zombies the moment they step into
a movie theater. But you know: Suspension of disbelief is one thing;
brain damage is something entirely different. The former makes you
accept that the dead may walk, the later forcefully feeds you with
everything else in this movie.<br /><br />In short: If you liked the original, you&#39;ll be disappointed with this
sequel (to say the least). Unless, of course, you are one of those guys
who only care about hot babes kicking ass and think than people like me
are stupid film critic wannabes. If not, see the DAWN OF THE DEAD
remake instead. It&#39;s the same, but good.
