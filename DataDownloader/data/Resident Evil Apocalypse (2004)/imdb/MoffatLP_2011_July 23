Watching this film made me want to give it an 8/10, upon further review
I would score it 6.5/10. There were little things that it did right but
not necessarily good. Being a fan of the first one I knew that this
wouldn&#x27;t match it. To much of my surprise I actually got a decent film
with loads of action but a little thought of plot. Here are my
thoughts.<br /><br />The acting in &#x27;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x27; was a great improvement from
the previous installment of the series. A major downside to the
previous film in the &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27; series was the acting which was
really bad. Milla Jovovich delivered her role well enough and there
weren&#x27;t revealing flaws on her behalf. Along with some other actors it
set the standard for acting that the rest of the series can look up to.<br /><br />There was a lot of action in this, and when I say a lot I mean A LOT of
it. There was a consecutive amount of of action that scenes follow up
by another. It was thankfully entertaining though because I wasn&#x27;t
receiving much else from it. The action isn&#x27;t the best thing that could
happen with this but it was pretty intense to say the least. The film
brought back memorable creatures like the zombie dogs and introduced
the most intense thing ever, the nemesis.<br /><br />The plot was little thought of though. This was the major flaw of the
film that really brought my hopes down. In my opinion a plot is the
major component of a movie, when you have movies without a plot it
tends to make it fairly worse (i.e. 1998 Godzilla). The plot is pretty
much like every other zombie film out there but the first film of the
series had its own original plot. This I didn&#x27;t have much expectations
for so I can&#x27;t be too disappointed.<br /><br />The film was okay, it wasn&#x27;t too too bad but it certainly wasn&#x27;t as
good as the first installment. Hopefully in the future the films will
be matched up to the beginning of the series. But to say the least, I
didn&#x27;t waste my time with this film. I must say that I expected to see
a piece of trash, but I really got what I want, loads of action and
fairly good acting.<br /><br />My rate, 6.5/10 for its incredible amount of action but the very little
thought of plot.
