The film begins with a recap of what happened at the end of the last
film with Alice waking up to discover Racoon city dead empty. After
this we see the virus is released by some Umbrella workers who go into
the hive to check what had happen and in doing so, they release the
virus and these zombies into the city. To counter attack this problem
Umbrella decides to seal off the city even with many uninfected
citizens and law-enforcements getting left behind. Alice discovers that
she has been injected with a virus, which has given her superhuman
abilities. She also come across a small group of survivors led by
officer Jill Valentine that she teams up with after being contacted by
doctor who wants them to find his daughter and in exchange he&#39;ll get
them out before Umbrella nukes their mishap.<br /><br />Now this felt like a video game, but that doesn&#39;t mean its actually a
good film. I found it to be an improvement over the unexceptional first
flick, but not by too much. The original film was directed by Paul
Anderson, but he decided to go with the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; project
instead of directing this piece. He might not have directed the film,
but he did write the screenplay for sequel. Instead debut director
Alexander Witt sits in the director&#39;s chair and brings to the series a
far more expansive cookie cutter action flick that&#39;s very nice to look
at. Well, that is the case when you can see what&#39;s happening! Just like
the first film this one is just as slick and overly showy in detail.
But what did become distracting was the constant use of stupid
slow-motion and hasty editing that just got in the way of some of the
action. Witt goes out of his way to up the action in leaps and bounds.
While, these moments might be longer and be filled with many stylistic
Matrix touches, but they just seemed quite pedestrian and unexciting at
times. The fast and furious camera-work and pounding metal soundtrack
is what gave these scenes its jumpy and highly-powered bursts. It just
falls in the same hole as the first film with the arty techniques
taking over the show, but at least on this occasion there was more
brainless action to go around within it&#39;s flashy imprints. What I found
a crime was that, where was the splatter? Yep, the violence is watered
down and even far more than the previous flick, but the CGI effects
were slightly better. The monster make-up is top-notch, though. The
morbid claustrophobic atmosphere of &quot;The Hive&quot; in the first is replaced
here with an subdued post-apocalyptic presence in the city.<br /><br />Again the ragged plot and characters are secondary to the gloss and
glitter of the production. The basic story sets up a typical small
group of one-dimensional survivors trying to survive from a horde of
zombies, rabid dogs and a mutant killing machine and at the end it gets
us geared up for another sequel. It&#39;s the usual fluff with many
incoherent and illogical lapses and cardboard, comic characters. The
plot throws in everything but the kitchen sink from that of the power
and influence of the corporation to flashbacks and heroic nonsense. But
they don&#39;t bother to make too much sense of it with the inane script
coming across with the standard clich&eacute; dialogue. They even try to
demonstrate some humour with a comic relief character played by Mike
Epps that draws more duds and only adds to the misfire. The humour just
feels miscast, but Epps&#39; performance is the most lively. The other
performances are reasonably cold, but I thought that the always sexy
Milla Jovovich was fine and kicked ass again, but really she wasn&#39;t
given enough to do and she should&#39;ve been made the centrepiece. Sienna
Guillory looked great as the strong willed, mini-skirt wearing Jill
Valentine. While, the support roles from Oded Fehr, Sandrine Holt, Zack
Ward and Jared Harris are thin at best.<br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; is a boisterous and overblown piece of junk
that just can&#39;t keep still for too long. Well, at least this popcorn
flick does kinda entertain and gladly flies by quick enough. Amen!
