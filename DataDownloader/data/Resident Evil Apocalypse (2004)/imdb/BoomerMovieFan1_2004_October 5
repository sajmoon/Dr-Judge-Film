Character Development: Not much, but typical for an action movie.<br /><br />Character Appeal: Milla Jovovich plays a kind of female Arnold
Schwarzenegger, a grown-up Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's no great
actress, but she's convincing as a zombie-killer. She also has a
natural, unaltered-by-plastic-surgery, beauty that makes her very
appealing to the male target audience of this movie.<br /><br />Cinematography and Editing: OK overall. However, as in some other
recent movies of this genre, you can't really see much when the zombies
are being hit by punches, kicks or bullets due to a combination of
quick cuts and rapid camera movement. This may bother some people, but
I didn't mind it too much.<br /><br />Gore: Surprisingly little for a zombie movie, mainly due to the camera
movement and editing mentioned above.<br /><br />Holes in the Plot: Typical for an action movie. The biggest one I
noticed--zombies only appear when they are necessary to the plot. At
times the city seems completely deserted, not a zombie in sight. At
other times, on cue, masses of them appear out of nowhere. <br /><br />My Take: I liked The Apocalypse better than the first movie because it
takes place in Raccoon City rather than in the subterranean Hive, which
I found to be too monotonous and confining. This movie delivers what it
promises--non-stop action from beginning to end. It's not going to win
any Academy Awards, but it's good escapist entertainment. (6 out of 10)
