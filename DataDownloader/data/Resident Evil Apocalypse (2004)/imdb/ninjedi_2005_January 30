2005_January 30 
From a major fan of the games and a lover of good films (esp.
horror)... only watch this film when your tired, or drunk, or
half-dead, or in some state that lowers your capacity for thought. I
liked the first one, it was fun, in no way did justice to the cinematic
and atmospheric potential of the games, but hey, who expected it to?
But seriously, this one is just...just... words cannot describe. Okay,
so there are a few nice references to the game, more than in the first
one, but as a film. Why? A joke? Watch this film only out of curiosity,
if your a fan of the game, if you've seen the first one (otherwise...
just forget it) and if your mind is switched to standby.<br /><br />And to think Anderson showed such great potential after Event
Horizon... Oh dear.
