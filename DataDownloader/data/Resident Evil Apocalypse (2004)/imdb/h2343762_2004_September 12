I just got back from resident evil apocalypse and if you want suspense
and comic relief all in one, then go see this movie. It follows certain
elements of the various games. After seeing this film, I can't wait to
see the next chapter. I loved the first film and this film kept my
interest. Time passed so fast that you didn't have time to look at your
watch. I would recommend this film highly.Also Oder Fehr is something
to look at. Go see this film, you won't regret it. I loved Dawn of the
Dead from this year also but this is a different type of zombie film.
It showed people who were intelligent and you didn't know what was
going to happen next. The special effects and the fights scenes alone
are worth going to see this film. The cast was great and hope to see
them back soon for the next chapter.
