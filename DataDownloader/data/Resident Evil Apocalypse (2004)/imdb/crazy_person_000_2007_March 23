I for one LOVED this movie. It is one of the best action/horror films
I&#39;ve seen in a while. i thought the fight scenes where excellent, the
zombies where believable and the the main thing... The chicks RULE!!! I
love it when girls take the lead and can kick just as much ass (maybe
even more than the boys) its so awesome!! This movie takes off right
after the first one and basically whats happened is the virus has
gotten out into Raccon city and our favorite ass-kicking heroine Alice
is back with a few new faces including Sienna Guillory who plays Jill
Valentine another kick-ass girl, Oded Ferh who plays Carlos Olivera,and
Mike Epps who plays L.J. Also there&#39;s a big bad mutated guy called
Nemisis who wants to destroy them. the Umbrella company is also back at
their lowest as they try to kill the city.<br /><br />This is an awesome movie!!!
