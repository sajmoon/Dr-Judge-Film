One of the best adaptations of a game/comic to movie ever! Sure they
didn't stay exactly on the story as we know it but they kept it a
original as possible. Look at X-men, 1 and 2. Although both they were
pretty good, they totally F'd up the story. I walked out of the theater
angry as hell at the fact that they totally erased Wolverine and Lady
Death strick's relationship. In my opinion, they should respect the
story line more; after all it's that story that's gotten as popular as
it is. THis movie does that more than any other that I've seen (Maybe
Spiderman as well but the girl that plays MJ REALLY doesn't fit: not
hot enough).<br /><br />Even if you're not too familiar with the original, you'll like this
movie. If you can: rent the 1st one. You'll have a better understanding
of part 2 but even if you don't see 1, you'll still like this one.
