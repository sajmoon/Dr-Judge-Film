This is the action/horror movie of the summer. Spiderman 2 is the only
movie that could possibly suprass this thriller. It was obvious that
this movie had a much larger budget than the prequel and the plot was
a lot more developed. As a fan of the games i enjoyed the minor plot
changes from the transition of game to film to keep me guessing and the
holes of information that were filled in by the movies that are not
explained in the game. Spectacular special effects. The introduction of
Jill into the storyline was fantastic and i would look forward to
another prequel that explains the introduction of Jill into the
Resident Evil saga as the movie doesn't really explain it all that well.
The ending was twisted, but left open for a third movie (which is
rumored to be loosely based on the game (Code Veronica). An all around
great movie and must see for action fans.
