This movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I thought it would be a
pretty decent flick worthy of passing some time, instead I find one of
the better action movies I have seen all year. I am one of the few who
liked the first one, but this one is much better. I just thought it was
more like the game itself without taking itself to seriously or getting
to campy. You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for
survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really
good. Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi
monsters. I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally
cgi monsters in the movie. The nemesis monster is done completely with
makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk
using the same technique. This one picks up where the last one left off
as Alice finds herself in the middle of a virtual war. The additions to
the cast are all welcome changes from the last movie as the person who
plays Jill Valentine both looks and acts like the character from the
game. Scores of undead are killed and various other monsters and
enemies line the path as we follow a group of survivors desperate to
get out of the sealed city. Kind of sad that this one is so good and it
is based on a video game and a movie based on a comic &quot;Alien Vs
Predator&quot; was not nearly as good.
