The movie starts kind of interesting, where somehow zombies break out
in a city and the umbrella corporation decides to close the city,
leaving everyone as a victim for the zombies. Then it&#39;s just one big
sequence of killing, killing and killing. Then there&#39;s a new character,
the Nemesis, who is killing all umbrella security men with a huge
machine gun and a rocket launcher. Apart from these facts, there is no
storyline. What really irritated me are the sound effects. They are
about 10 times louder than anything else in the movie, making me grab
the remote all the time to put the volume lower when there were
explosions and then higher again so I was able actually to hear any
voices. The person who mixed the sound effect must&#39;ve been an amateur,
a pro would&#39;ve used a compressor/limiter to make the volume of the
sound effects equal to the rest of the volume in the movie.
