despite its follower (extinction) this film actually covers majority of
the video game (RE3:N) it takes place in glorious raccoon city. the
nemesis has joined the party, but you can clearly tell that the film
makers threw in their own ingredients for the story. the nemesis was
only created to see how &quot;strong&quot; Alice is. the nemesis only sticks to
his true nature (from the game) when he is first introduced as he is
blowing away the STARS members, then he is just an obstacle that Alice
must over come. i wasn&#39;t very fond of the &quot;boss&quot; battle, who is
stronger, Alice or Nemesis.<br /><br />good-stuck to the game, included Jill valentine and nemesis. nemesis
looked great but purpose was altered bad-the zombie attacks seemed
unorganized. it was like the film makers said, lets throw in a bunch
here, there. don&#39;t get me wrong, yea its &quot;zombie flick&quot; but extinction
felt more like a video game (crows first, super zombies second, then
boss battle) in apocalypse, the zombies seemed as if no one cared when
they arrived. nemesis boss battle (alive vs nemesis) was dumb-who is
stronger? i wanted an actual creature to mutate (like the licker or Dr.
Isaacs from the other films) summary-its enjoyable, its there, i
enjoyed extinction better (despite it didn&#39;t stick to any of the games)
