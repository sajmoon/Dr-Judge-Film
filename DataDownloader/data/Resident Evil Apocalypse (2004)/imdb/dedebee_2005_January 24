What an appropriate subtitle, as the fact that this movie debuted at #1
and made almost $24 million in its first weekend of release is a sure
sign that the end of the world is near. The first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film
was a misguided mess. The video game actually had an appropriate plot
that was easily transferable to film, but writer/director/cinematic
nightmare Paul W.S. Anderson jettisoned it for an unoriginal and boring
zombie-fest. Anderson isn't directing this time, but he still holds a
stake in this terrible film as the screenwriter. A laughable plot, zero
character development and horrendous acting are key reasons to stay
away from this one, with the main reason being it's simply just not
entertaining.
