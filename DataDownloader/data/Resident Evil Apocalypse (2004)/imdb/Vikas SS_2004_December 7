Outline (The brief story is for those who haven't seen the first movie,
without which they might not understand the second one):<br /><br />In the end of the first movie Resident Evil, we see only two survivors
out of the T-virus tragedy at Umbrella Corporation's hi-tech 'Hive'
research facility, one of them being Alice (Milla Jovovich). For those
who have not seen the first movie, the Hive is the secret underground
research facility of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's most
powerful commercial organization that specializes in high-end genetic
research and mutation. The two survivors have been tested and have been
genetically altered to gain superhuman strengths. One of them is Alice,
and the other is an armed killing machine, the Nemesis.<br /><br />By the beginning of Apocalypse, we see that the dangerous T-virus that
induces people become Zombies is out in the open in Raccoon city. The
umbrella corporation loses no time in unlawfully quarantining people
and leaving them to the mercy of the T-virus that spreads through
zombie bites. What follows then, is a series of mindless adventures.<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />The movie seems to be a desperate attempt to revive the success of the
movie Resident Evil that had raked in a hundred million dollars. A
viewer who has previously not seen the first movie would rather feel
like running away from the movie hall in the middle of the movie.
However, as the movie approaches the end, it gains a little better
sense.<br /><br />One of the most seemingly realistic things projected by the film
include the dangers of overtly powerful corporations that can threaten
the future lives of people with their genetic experiments.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich's performance is purely action oriented and is
exponentially better than the earlier movie (thanks to her character
'Alice' becoming genetically powerful). The other performances are just
around the average performance that you would see in a usual Hollywood
sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Bottomline: If possible, please leave your brains outside the theatre
entrance. Else, you might become a T-virus carrier Zombie&#133; ;)
