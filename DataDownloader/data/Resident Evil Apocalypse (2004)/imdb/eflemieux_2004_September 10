Oh my god... When i think that my $ 9.25 could have bought some
starving child a couple of Big Macs and I spent the money on watching
this bomb...<br /><br />My mommy always said to start any comments on two positive notes: here
is the first: &quot;the cast looks well fed&quot;. Now the second... Wait a
minute, I cannot find anything positive to say!!! Finally, he is a
second positive comment: &quot;the trucks are clean and the wheels are well
balanced&quot;.<br /><br />This movie is really bad. Really... Milla Jovovich is laughably bad.
Her last scenes are absolutely horrible. Sienna Guillory is painful to
look at, please someone feed this chick!!<br /><br />On the other hand, Oded Fehr isn't bad. <br /><br />Being Canadian myself, I believe I have the right to criticize the
typically Canadian-made cheap-*** look of this movie. The rule is
simple: you can blow up stuff, you can shoot at stuff but never, never
break anything expensive. During the movie, I could hear bean-counters
in the background, worrying the movie was gonna break its low budget.
The helicopter crash scene is a complete joke - you can hear the
producer say &quot;well, show the chopper in the air, then show it crashed,
the audience will... imagine the crash&quot;.<br /><br />The choice of location is an insult to intelligence for the Canadian
audience... we can see about 10 Canadian companies logos in the
backgrounds. Please.... &quot;Raccoon City, Ontario&quot;?? <br /><br />The plot holes in the story are wide enough to float an aircraft
carrier sideways through them. The guy who wrote this movie should go
back to writing stories for &quot;Clifford the big red dog&quot; or become script
editor for the Teletubbies.<br /><br />One last mean comment: how can a director screw-up the acting of
zombies??? The zombies in that movie are the worst i've ever seen. In
Raccoon City, &quot;dead&quot; equals &quot;moronic looking&quot;. The extras on this movie
should look for other jobs, like... playing heads of lettuce in grocery
commercials.<br /><br />Please, stay home and hit yourself on the head with a telephone book!!
You'll save money, you'll have fun and you'll see stars that act way
better than any of the cast!!
