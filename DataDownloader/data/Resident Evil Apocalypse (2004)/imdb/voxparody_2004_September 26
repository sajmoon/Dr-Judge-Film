2004_September 26 

This is a thinly disguised rip-off of John Carpenter's &quot;Escape from New
York,&quot; &quot;Escape from Los Angeles,&quot; and George A. Romero's zombie-film
series... to say nothing about the infinite amount of ultra violent
video games. I have nothing against violent content in films or video
games, but when I go to a movie, I expect to see something &quot;filmed&quot; and
not so overly-digitized (Case in point: Those long-tongued monsters
crawling around the church). <br /><br />In 'Apocalypse' we get a female superhero: Jovovich plays &quot;Alice,&quot; an
uberpowerful genetic Amazonian-freak out to rescue a small group of
people still trapped in a quarantined New World city (nifty sequence in
which we see Toronto, Canada's City Hall blown up to smithereens).<br /><br />The film is largely enjoyable but, as is usually the case nowadays in
genre-pics such as this, the writers/makers try to insert a clever
ending, and only end up frustrating our otherwise positive
expectations. Although I liked REA, it was neither clever or good
enough to recommend to anyone who expects anything anywhere close to
the infinite amount of creativity evinced in the &quot;Matrix&quot; films or as
'literary' as &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br /><br />Strangely, previously released films such as &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999)and the
&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake, came to mind while I was watching REA. <br /><br />(NOTE: Oded Fehr, from Mummy, appears in REA)<br /><br />Jovovich seems destined to only appear in TV makeup commercials or
sci-fi-action films. For those movie-fans unaware, she also appeared in
the orig. 'Resident Evil' film and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; with (Yawn!)
Bruce Willis.
