I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil series of video games, having played
nearly all of them. But i have only just got around to watching this
movie version, as a had not bothered about it because i had heard &amp;
read so many negative reviews. In fact i was expecting this movie to be
a complete &amp; utter load of pants. But i actually thought that it was
pretty darn good, better than the Tomb Raider series of movie game tie
ins. I think that most people who have played &amp; enjoyed the games will
appreciate this film. It has great action &amp; suspense, there was some
humour &amp; the characters were well portrayed too, i mean i felt i did
care about them. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie &amp; think it's a shame
that it got slated so badly in the reviews &amp; maybe put a lot of people
of seeing it. I think the reason it got such negative reviews are
because it is a movie of a computer game. Anyway if you enjoy a movie
with plenty of action some scares, suspense &amp; humour &amp; especially if
you enjoy the games. Get this one out &amp; enjoy it.
