I LOVED the first &quot;Resident Evil.&quot; Loved it. I thought it was scary,
suspenseful, and fun. And I thought Milla Jovovich was absolutely
gorgeous in it. But I guess that's because she looked very put together
and feminine. In this absolute devastation of a movie, she looks like a
hag. I'm sorry, Milla fans, don't ax murder me, because I am a huge
Milla fan, too. But no one can honestly say, after watching this movie,
that she hasn't been overdoing it on the coke/pot/booze. She's aging
faster than she should, and it ain't pretty. And what was up with her
hair?? It was so stringy it looked like dreadlocks. And what happened
to those semi-curves she had in the first &quot;Evil&quot;? Now she's a virtual
stick, which that ugly costume they had her in didn't help at all. And
sorry to say, her topless scene at the end was the scariest thing in
the whole movie. Her nipples looked like Milk Duds. OK, now I'll wait
for the hate mail to pour in, thank you very much :)
