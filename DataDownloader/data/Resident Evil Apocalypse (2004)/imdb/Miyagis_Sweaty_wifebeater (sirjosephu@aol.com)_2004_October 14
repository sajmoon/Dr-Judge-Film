Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) was a lot better than I expected. I
was disappointed by the first film. It was kind of cool because it's
been awhile since I seen a zombie movie on the big screen but the end
results were mediocre at best. The sequel was far more entertaining and
more like a video game movie. The only thing that would keep this movie
from getting a higher rating is the fact that there is very little
blood or gore. Besides a couple of scenes there really isn't much. The
action<br /><br />set pieces were pretty good whilst the pacing is just right for a movie
of this type.<br /><br />Taking place right after the events that have transpired in the first
film, Racoon City has been overruned with zombies! The Umbrella
corporation (doing what all big companies would do) remove all key
important members of their company from the city and seal off the exits
in hope of trying to contain their little accident. <br /><br />The city is sealed off from the rest of the world. It's residents are
cut off and are basically left to fend for themselves whilst<br /><br />the virus runs it's course. But a few people inside don't want to
become a zombie's midnight snack. So it's up to Claire and Alice plus a
few other survivors to try and survive. But a wrench is thrown into
their plans. Umbrella wants to try out their latest and most expensive
project to date. Fans of the video game series know whom I'm talking
about!<br /><br />A fun film that'll entertain genre fans. Just don't expect a lot from a
movie like this. You have to rate films like this differently than
other genres (such as Dramas and Epics). This is the kind of movie
you'll just have to leave your thinking caps at the door.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />B
