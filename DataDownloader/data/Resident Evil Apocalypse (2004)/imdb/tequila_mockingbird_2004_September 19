This movie is what might happen if you take a typical zombie flick and
give it a plot, lot's of action, and a large city with PLENTY of extras
to show mobs of zombies. It has humor. It has suspense. And it has a
plot that unfolds; even if you've played the games, it's got plenty of
changes to keep you guessing. With, I might add, several of the game
characters (Jill, Carlos, and the little girl). I enjoyed this movie
better than any since Lord of the Rings, Return of the King. Not that
you could compare the two. It's just that there haven't been too many
good movies since then.<br /><br />Milla Jojovich is really cool and she's a talented actress. Her
character really rocks when her hidden secrets come out. Mike Epps kept
me rolling with laughter. He's always funny, and it was quite nice and
different to see Oded Fehr in this role as Carlos. Cool. As for Sienna
Guillory as Jill Valentine... she was a PERFECT match. This movie was
very fun and I'd love to see it again and again and again....<br /><br />I voted 9/10. I thought they out-did themselves on this one and i
thought the first one was good....
