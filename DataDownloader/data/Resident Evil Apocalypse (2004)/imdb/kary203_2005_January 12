Hi everyone, I just want to say that Resident Evil and Resident
Evil:Apocalypse are one of the best Zombie movies ever. I've seen my
brother play all the RESIDENT EVIL games and I'm just so addicted to
them. All the games are my favorite games ever. And I just cant wait
for the producer to make another movie but with more characters from
the movie like Claire,Jill, Wesker and more known S.T.A.R.S. members. I
thought that in the first RESIDENT EVIL movie their was some characters
of the game and I was kind of disappointed. But hey the movie was
great. Nemesis was so cool especially it's costume. I really enjoyed
seeing the movie and I really recommen it a lot. Well thanks for
listening and this movie deserves a 10!!!!
