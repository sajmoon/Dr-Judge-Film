A little over two years ago, sci-fi director Paul W.S. Anderson (&quot;Event
Horizon&quot;) was given the task to write and direct a feature film
adaptation of the neo-classic, Zombie video game &quot;Resident Evil.&quot; It
was long-rumored that legendary Zombie-film director George A. Romero
(The &quot;Dead&quot; Trilogy) would be the helmer, much to fans&#39; joy. However,
Romero&#39;s script was turned down and the studio went with Anderson, who
previously done a somewhat decent film adaptation to another
neo-classic video game, &quot;Mortal Kombat.&quot;<br /><br />Many genre fans, as well as die hard fans of the game, were not too
pleased with the choice of Anderson. With four films to his credit,
none of them were widely respected by critics or film goers. With the
exception of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (which received a three plus-fold profit
of its production budget), all his films flopped. However, Anderson
does have his loyals but not nearly as much as he has haters. I for
one, think Paul W.S. Anderson is a fine genre director and he has my
uttermost respect; especially since we don&#39;t have enough R-rated sci-fi
these days. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was a mediocre hit, making a slight profit
but turned in mixed reviews, for purists thought Anderson strayed away
from the game and concentrated more on telling the introduction story.
But that was the smart way to handle this material. Anderson set up
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; perfectly...giving us elements of the game but telling
the solid story of a viral outbreak, known as the T-Virus, in the
Umbrella Corporation&#39;s underground facility, The Hive, and not bringing
it to the surface. That story they waited for, in &quot;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&quot;...and man was it worth the wait.<br /><br />Anderson stepped down as director of &quot;Apocalypse,&quot;, so he can work on
yet another eagerly anticipated adaptation of a video game, comic
book/popular fan boy wet dream film, &quot;Alien vs. Predator.&quot; The
directing duty is taken over by popular second unit director Alexander
Witt. Anderson&#39;s screenplay is tight and well-done, giving the video
game purists exactly what they wanted for the first film, the outbreak
of the virus in Raccoon City.<br /><br />We pick up were the first one left us, even going back a few days
before Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up at the end of the first film,
explaining what exactly happened. The T-Virus has spread around Raccoon
City and certain V.I.P&#39;s are immediately evacuated, including Dr.
Ashford (Jared Harris), a valuable scientist of the Umbrella
Corporation, and his daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), whose
evacuation is unsuccessful when the evac car crashes and Angie seeks
refuge somewhere in the city. We also are introduced to Jill Valentine
(Sienna Guillory), a tough &#39;n sexy recently demoted member of Umbrella
Corp&#39;s elite Special Tactics and Services (S.T.A.R.S.), with no respect
for the rules. Umbrella then contains the city via a surrounding wall
(reminiscent of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;) and sets up a gate where
residents are checked for the virus, and once the virus hits the gate,
Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) seals Raccoon City, with hundreds of
uninfected residents still inside, including Jill, Sgt. Peyton Wells,
another member of S.T.A.R.S, Teri (Sandrine Holt), a TV reporter and in
a distant part of the city, a whole S.T.A.R.S. team, led by Carlos
Olivera (Oded Fehr), all expendable and vulnerable to Zombie feeding. <br /><br />Alice awakes and discovers that the virus is exposed to the public and
puts herself in kick- ass mode. But our beloved Alice has changed, she
is now a genetically enhanced super-being with impressive strength,
maneuvers and tactics. This shows itself when Alice saves Jill, Peyton
and Teri in a church from three mutated Zombies known as Lickers; what
a killer scene. Meanwhile, Dr. Ashford contacts the small group (now
led by Alice), and makes a deal that the team rescues his daughter in
exchange for safe passage out of the city, all of which unbeknownst to
Major Cain. Ashford also contacts Olivera and his team, for the same
deal. It&#39;s not before long when Olivera and crew meet up with Alice and
crew and work as a team, but there&#39;s another problem that lurks in
Raccoon City...yes you guessed it...you know him and you love him,
Nemesis. Nemesis, is an Umbrella Corporation Bioweapons experiment. He
is an 8-foot tall concoction of an infected human, biomaterials, T-Cell
technology and military grade metals. He is computer controlled by
Umbrella operatives for combat missions. This guy is hardcore, wait
till you see him in action. <br /><br />So there&#39;s the story in a nutshell, I&#39;ll stop right here.<br /><br />Let me flat out say it, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; rocks and rolls!
Like &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;X2&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;RE2&quot;
succeeds and surpasses its predecessor. Anderson wrote a very good
script, faithful to the video game. For a first shot at the big time,
Alexander Witt turns in a nice achievement and proves himself an action
director. Milla Jovovich is sexy as ever and a balls to the wall
heroine that will be remembered in years to come. Sienna Guillory gives
Milla strong support as the tough and equally sexy Jill Valentine. Oded
Fehr (Ardeth Bey in &quot;The Mummy&quot; films) heroes it up, especially his
entrance scene when he flies out of a chopper with guns blazin&#39; and
Nemesis...you gotta see this guy! The film is tightly edited and the
set designs definitely do the video games justice. And lets not forget,
the sufficient amount of gritty gore and violence. <br /><br />Hands down the best film adapted from a video game to date. I look
forward to &quot;Part III.&quot;
