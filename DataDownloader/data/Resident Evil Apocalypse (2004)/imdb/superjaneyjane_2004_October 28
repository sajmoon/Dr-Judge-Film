To be honest, I found this movie so boring and uninteresting, that for
me, the most exciting part of the screening was when one of my friends'
drink bottle started spraying coke everywhere. The special effects are
lame, the storyline is pathetic and the acting is completely flat,
(apart from that guy with the bad hat). For a film about zombies it
sure doesn't pay much attention to them, instead focusing on some of
the most fake looking monsters I have ever seen. The big baddie, known
as Nemesis, looked so much like Sloth from the 'Goonies' I couldn't
help going into hysterics every time he appeared on screen.<br /><br />The script is a complete mess. You wouldn't believe the number of plot
holes they left. Milla Jojovich sure does look the part as your
standard kick-ass heroine, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sigourney
Weaver or Carrie-Anne Moss. I wasted almost 2 hours in that movie
theatre watching that crap. I want them back! If you want a good zombie
movie, try Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead or even Shaun of the dead if
you're up for a laugh. Don't bother with Resident Evil: Apocalypse.
It's not even worth the VIDEO rental price, let alone cinema admission.
