Oh yes, my brothers. Prepare yourself for a destructive ride like
nothing you've ever experienced before. And I'm not talking about the
dizzying, set-destructive fight scenes or the glorious fireballs
erupting across Raccoon City. I'm talking about the 3rd Degree burns,
the horrible temporary blindness, and reoccurring heartburn this movie
has gifted me with.<br /><br />Usually it's just the hard liqueur coursing through my veins that makes
me want to hurt cute things, but tonight it's both the booze and the
fact that I'm $7.50 less drunk, and an hour and a half older because of
'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' You see, when I go into a movie, I expect
things. Things like, oh I don't know... plot, coherent scene structure,
oh and a side of enjoyment. <br /><br />OK, enough of my random whining. Down to the meat of this rancid corpse
of a movie. It was nothing like the original. That can be expected, but
when the original formula went so well (styling, action flow, pacing,
and the great music), you shouldn't change things. The new action
sequences were way too fast, to jumpy and all-in-all just
incomprehensible. <br /><br />The zombies were as unpredictable as a crack junkie with nothing but a
rubber chicken to his name and the will to use it. They freakin'
appeared and disappeared as if Sigfried, Roy, Stephen Hawking and the
entire cast of Diff'rent Strokes were on the sidelines, messin' with
all of Raccoon City. Maybe I'm just too much of a Romero-Zombie fan,
but I think that an entire city block of zombies shouldn't pop in to
eat one person and then wander off 'aimlessly' in less than 4 seconds.
Oh, and what about the graveyard full of zombies that clawed their way
out of the ground in unison? This isn't 'Return of the Living Dead,'
man. There was no set up or explanation for that, dude. I thought that
in order to become a freakin' zombie, you had to be infected with the
T-virus... What, did they claw their way from inside the Hive or
something? &quot;Hey, man, let's get out of this hive thing and go eat some
brains. There's the door right there.&quot; &quot;No dude... I've got a better
idea. Hope you brought your shovel.&quot; When they popped up, I half
expected Jacko to pop in and lead them in a synchronized dance to the
rap stylings of the late, great Vincent Price. OK, I'm running out of
room here. One last thing: The fight scene between Nemesis and Milla...
Whoa. I didn't know life could hurt this bad. Evil Boss Man: &quot;We
created you two in a lab, man. Isn't that cool? Well, instead of
keeping the both of you as an unbeatable pair of killing machines...
We're gonna' make you fight each other...&quot; Milla: (looks to Nemesis and
throws a wild stance) &quot;Now we must kung-fu fight!&quot; The icing on the
freakin' cake was the &quot;Finish Him&quot; line from the boss man. I was
reaching for my portable arc-welder just to keep my mouth shut long
enough so I wouldn't scream out &quot;Give 'im the pit, Kitana!! What are
you waiting for? FORWARD DOWN FORWARD X, CHICK!!&quot; My last words on this
one: Run. Run as fast as your birdlike legs can carry you.
