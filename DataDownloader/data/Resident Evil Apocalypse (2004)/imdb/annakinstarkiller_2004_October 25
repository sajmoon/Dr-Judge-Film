I really liked the movie. I don't think it was geared toward all
audiences, but mainly for those that truly follow the game and can
truly enjoy the inner plot of the movie. The only thing that bothered
me a bit, but was still OK, was that Nemesis helped out in the end. In
the game Nemesis was a bad-a who didn't take any crap. I love some of
the inner sequencing that gave homage to the games like RE: Code
Veronica. The scene towards the end when Alice is running from a
helicopter and the helicopter is shooting at her is from RE: CV. It's
awesome. In the game, which the character running the scene is Claire,
does the same type of scene and the ending of the scene in both the
game and movie is alike. They get stopped by security, drop the gun,
catch it halfway down and fire at them. I hope they make a third. If
they do, I'm there.
