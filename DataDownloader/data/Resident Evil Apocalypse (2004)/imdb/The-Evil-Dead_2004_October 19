First off, I'm a huge fan of really cheesy and overdone movies that
lack any plot, character, yet entertain at the same time. If there's
going to be zombies, ridiculous fight scenes, and really bad
dialogue... You better believe I'll be there watching whatever it is.<br /><br />That said, you'll understand why I love this movie so much.<br /><br />What we have here is a great slice of B movie greatness. We have our
lovely super powered heroine, Alice, a ridiculously Rambo like Jill,
and some side characters that don't really matter to much... Top that
off with some super zombie that shoots a rocket launcher and you're in
for a great time.<br /><br />The storyline of the movie is quite ridiculous compared to the first.
The first movie at least had a fairly decent story and managed to be a
decent thriller with some good IL fashion zombie killing. It was
slightly cheesy, but not nearly to the degree of this movie. Alice from
the first movie is trying to escape the city, meets up with Jill and
her buddy... They find a few more people, need to escape the city
before Umbrella nukes it, and the only way out is some scientist that
wants his daughter to be safely escorted out of the city. Of course,
this means that legions of zombies must be fought, as well as the giant
nemesis creature. This leads up for lots of overblown action sequences
that will bring a smile to your face as you laugh at how awesomely bad
they are.<br /><br />To get technical We have special forces units capable of delivering
head shot after head shot to zombies in a most ludicrous fashion.
Everyone who is part of the main cast is also the same, they have dead
aim no matter what position they're shooting from. <br /><br />The only major flaw I can think of with this movie is that if you're a
serious sort of person that doesn't enjoy a cheesy movie, then you're
not going to enjoy this movie. Stay away from it and watch some stupid
movie like The Grudge or something instead.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously and can be
enjoyed if you're watching it in that mindset. It's definitely one of
my favorite movies of the year and I'll be purchasing it the moment it
hits DVD shelves. If you're looking for a great time at the movies and
enjoy a healthy amount of B in your flicks, then this one is for you.<br /><br />9/10
