I loved both of the Resident Evil movies. I think that were the last
one left off at and the second one picked up at was great. I wish that
they will hurry up and start filming the third one so I can see it. But
I guess I will have to wait and be patient and I hope it is just as
good as the other two. I do know that they will be filming it in
Toronto and some in england i read somewhere. I already own the first
resident evil and resident evil apocalypse so I will defiantly have to
add the final resident evil afterlife whenever it does come out on DVD.
I rate both of the movies a 10 due to the fact that i loved both of
these movies and hope i can rate the third one a 10 also. But will have
to just wait and see!!!!
