President Evil =============
A biotech lab seeks world market domination for its products. To
achieve this goal they produce extraordinary superhuman zombies and
make one of them run for president. With him in power the company will
be free to topple competition in a perfectly legal fashion.<br /><br />However, not everything is going according to plan. A previous
(apparently flawed) version of president-zombies escapes the lab and
decides to run for the presidential post on its own.<br /><br />The lab is furious and to take the rebel out of the race they send a
zombie supermodel who must derail his campaign by using persuasion,
treachery or... love.<br /><br />After getting attached to each other in a zombie love the rebel
persuades the model to break free from the lab and help him win the
race. In a tight election he becomes the new president... The country
is saved with a victory of the good.<br /><br />Viewers are allowed to suspect that she is the real one sent by the lab
to rule the country as the First Lady.<br /><br />Evil wins because it is more sophisticated than the true love.<br /><br />President Evil 2 ===============
The greedy biotech lab (see President Evil 1) has become a greedy
multi-billion dollar corporation. Zombie presidents have risen to
importance in many countries and companies. The world is ruled by
biotech monsters who make no errors in business or politics. Their only
not-so-good feature is extreme cruelty and hate of human beings.<br /><br />A &quot;competitor&quot; biotech firm decides to end this unfair game. They
create a zombie &quot;man&quot; who must turn it around. The idea is that he has
to learn to be superhuman in a human way. To achieve this they send him
for training with an old guru who lives in solitude in the jungle.<br /><br />The guru is not happy to help a corporation but desperately needs a
student.<br /><br />In a year's time the new student learns the thousand-year wisdom and
returns to the biotech nightmare to fight robots.<br /><br />To achieve this he infiltrates the government and starts to turn off
its zombies one by one by confronting them with illogical riddles. But
however hard he tries, their numbers only seem to increase&#133;<br /><br />At the President's Thanksgiving dinner he meets the head of the greedy
biotech giant. Believing he is a zombie, the protagonist is unable to
answer his enemy's riddle. The surprise help comes from the evil zombie
First Lady. Puzzled at the no-hate attitude, the protagonist presents
her with another riddle and gets an answer only a human would give.
Enlightened, he recognizes she is a human&#133; and so is he.<br /><br />Why would a human assist zombies in rising to almost absolute power? 'I
made her do it', the biotech godfather says looking at the smiles of
the protagonist and his newly-found love. 'Blame it on me'.<br /><br />Apparently, he set up this whole business so that these true &#150; and
extraordinary &#150; people could find and meet each other. Happy end.
