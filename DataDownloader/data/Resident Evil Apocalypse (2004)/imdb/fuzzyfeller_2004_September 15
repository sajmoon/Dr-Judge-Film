Not bad for the second entry based on the popular survivor horror game.
Milla Jojovich returns as Alice and is joined by Sienna Guillory as
Jill and Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera , fans of the games will note the
characters from the games and the monsters too like Nemesis. The action
is cool and slick but the fight scenes are rather jarring ,with a lot
of quick cutting , they need to get a good martial arts choreographer
so they don't have to cut in so much , much of that action is too blurry
. The plot and storyline pretty much follow the games with an ending
similar to resident evil outbreak. Not a bad effort for what the movie
is about . You do not go to see movies like this for acting ,just for
the fun and gore which by the way needs to be more emphasized ,an r
rating to me was a bit strong , a few gore scenes involving eating body
parts but not really enough to be like a day of the dead for example. <br /><br />hope the sequel and there will be one since the ending opens the door
wide open will be done better especially the fight scenes ...
