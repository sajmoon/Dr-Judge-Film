I didn't see the first Resident Evil..which I am hoping to watch but I
thought it was a really good movie. Not every sequel to a movie is
going to be as good as the first one but this a good movie and if I
liked this one I know I would like the first one. I think Milla Jovoich
is a talented actress she was brilliant playing Joan of Arc and I think
she kicked ass in this movie. Mike Epps made the movie have some funny
parts in the movie. The action by far was awesome! The beginning,
middle, and ending kept me wondering what was going to happen next and
the movie had so much suspense to it. The ending was great but I can't
wait to see what their going to do with the next Resident Evil..The
movie period was AWESOME!!
