In this sequel to 2002&#39;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Milla Jovovich returns as
Alice and joined by Sienna Guillory (The Time Machine) as Jill
Valentine, which we all know as the petite cop that becomes stronger
throughout the first game. She is not anything, but strong in this
flick. I never notice Jill Valentine worn such an inappropriate
wardrobe in the game she was always in her uniform, but in this movie
she looks like she&#39;ll fit in on the corner with all the other
prostitutes.<br /><br />I really don&#39;t want to ruin the movie for you, but since this has
nothing to do with the rest of the plot I&#39;ll tell you. Jill walks into
her police station and shoots &quot;Zombies&quot; in the head (Nobody knows these
people are the undead yet) and all her boss has to say is &quot;Valentine!&quot;.
She gives him a small speech about they&#39;re not alive and she goes on
shooting as he walks away. Wait, she&#39;ll be arrested on the spot no
matter what she said in that situation.<br /><br />Anyways, Mike Epps (Next Friday, Bait) joins the cast, (yes I said Mike
Epps) as the token black guy, I mean L.J. and of course Nemesis is in
it, but he even lacks something, maybe like realism and/or loyalty to
the video games.<br /><br />In my opinion, stay away from the whole Resident Evil series, it&#39;s
nothing but a waste of time and money. Even if Leon shows up, they&#39;ll
find away to mess his character up, so what&#39;s the point? If you do end
up watching this, don&#39;t expect much.
