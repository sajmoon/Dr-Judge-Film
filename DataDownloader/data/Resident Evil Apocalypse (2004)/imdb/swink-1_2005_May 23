&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; starts right there, where the audience has
left Alice. But while the first movie had a really cool and
claustrophobic atmosphere, watching this movie just gives you the
impression that the makers had too much of a budget and too many
thoughts that just don't fit together to make an enjoyable film.<br /><br />The main female kick arse characters of this movie - Alice and Jill
Valentine - are not credible. It is simply not enough to take two good
looking actresses and let them toy around with guns. The character of
L.J. is laden with dumb stereotypes. The evil corporation is just a
little bit too unbelievably evil for my taste. And the worst of all the
plot doesn't really make sense.<br /><br />Its just too much of everything in this movie!
