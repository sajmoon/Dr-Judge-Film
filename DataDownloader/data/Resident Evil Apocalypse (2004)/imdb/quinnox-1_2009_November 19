Another Resident Evil movie that I feel is under rated. Not as good as
the third movie - Extinction, but worth watching for some crack action
sequences as well as good creature and special effects. Milla Jovovich
again is great in her role, and as usual a very pretty presence on the
screen in her cute outfits. This movie has a lot of eye candy and is
plain fun to watch. People who like science fiction, action, or horror
movies would all find something to like here. I especially liked the
Nemesis creature, and all the tricks it had. It was like a super &#x22;boss&#x22;
from a video game. This had some nice production values in the various
sets, and it was convincing in making a futuristic setting appear
plausible.
