Resident Evil was an enjoyable Zombie blasting piece of cheese. Now we
are faced with the Sequel apocalypse and it really isn't up to scratch.
The action sequences may be well constructed and the lighting
throughout is perfect, but apart from that its a confused and thin
adventure. The story involves a good many Zombies and a rather
unimpresssive super villain so you can imagine its pretty predictable.
Milla Jovovich reprises her role from the original and to be honest I
cant remember anybody elses face. The acting is rather atrocious with
Milla Jovovich simply doing a bad Angelina Jolie impression. The rest
of the cast are feeble acting talents and that little girl is simply
annoying. There are several attempts at jokes throughout the film but
none really wash. The worst of them involve Zombie prostitutes. There
is nothing scary about the film either. The first had a couple of
chilling points but this film, is a wash with mild peril and no gore to
speak of. When it comes to these kinds of sequels its always best to
save the money and this movie doesn't change that point of fact.
