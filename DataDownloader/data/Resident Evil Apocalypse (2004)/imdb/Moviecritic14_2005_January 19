Wanna know what everybody's problem is? They're all sad that this movie
wasn't scary or the fact that it was filmed in Toronto (Americans do
this...a lot.). So all the nerds come onto this site and vote 5.6. It
makes me sick.<br /><br />This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen! And I'm happy
to have it in my DVD collection, alongside the first Resident Evil.<br /><br />It goes to show that a movie doesn't have to have good dialogue to be
good, it has to be enjoyable. And this is probably the most enjoyable
movie I've seen this year.<br /><br />I give this movie a perfect 10/10! Now that you're done listening to me
talk about it, go rent it! NOW!
