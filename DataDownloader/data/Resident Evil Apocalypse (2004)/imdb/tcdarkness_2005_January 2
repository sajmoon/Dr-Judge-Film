I've seen and laughed at a lot of bad zombie movies. This one isn't
technically the worst, but it comes pretty close. The &quot;plot&quot; is like
any other Paul WS Anderson movie, with action sequences followed by
characters telling you exactly what you already know and have seen. It
even includes the trademark time frame that characters have to escape
in in order to survive. You know exactly which characters will die in
the movie because they are either not top billed or act dumb or rudely
from the moment they step on screen. People and zombies appear out of
nowhere as the only basis of moving the &quot;plot&quot; forward.<br /><br />Direction is actually worse than the original. The slow-motion blur
shot of zombies isn't even remotely scary. The film is so fast-paced in
action and edit that it is hard to even make out how the characters
killed zombies and Umbrella Corp. guards. The acting is stunted by the
fact that everyone in the movie has a different accent.<br /><br />The movie is a funny film to watch, but only for Ed Woodian reasons.
