I have played several Resident Evil games, Resident evil 4 being my
favorite. This movie was entertaining to watch because it was so non
stop, but it did absolutely no justice to the games. The atmosphere,
acting and cinematics don't compare.<br /><br />They took you away from the resident evil franchise, gave you a female
character and several other people you don't know, and just made an
action movie, with poor acting for the most part.<br /><br />Resident Evil has always been, At least two main characters who are
usually in abandoned castles, trains, or houses with a slow pace and a
strong suspense that something could burst out, come alive or swarm you
in groups. Where as this movie was basically, too many extra's who were
given make up to look like they are gray, with maybe a hole in there
head, or a gash....who just flail around as they slowly walk up to you.
I did not like how they portrayed the undead. They were too human, and
too cheesy.<br /><br />I think they could of really done a better job at making this movie a
scary thriller like resident evil was supposed to be, rather then a non
stop action movie with too many swear words. I feel like Hollywood got
ahold of a great franchise and turned into something cheap and
overdone.
