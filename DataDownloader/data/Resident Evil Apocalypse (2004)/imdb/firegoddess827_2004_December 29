I personally loved this movie. I saw Resident Evil 1, and it wasn't as
good as the 2nd one. Maybe its just me, but I love the action, and the
constant suspense when you never know what will happen next. The music,<br /><br />I admit, wasn't as good as it should be. Milla is a great actress and
she does a lot of her own fighting, and that is admirable.<br /><br />I did, however, find a lot of bloopers, which made the movie less
enjoyable, but most weren't painfully obvious.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an
action packed show.<br /><br />This movie would definitely give anyone an adrenaline rush for the
fight scenes.
