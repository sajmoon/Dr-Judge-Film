Let me just start off by saying that Resident Evil Apocalypse is not
all that cracked up to be-so don't let those movie trailers or the DVD
commercials confuse you this thing in my opinion was god awful.<br /><br />The story pretty much wraps around Umbrella accidentally released a
virus into Raccoon City and now has to cover it up by releasing this
so-called creature &quot;Nemesis&quot; into the city to wipe out the city's
police. OK,it caught my attention at first but keep reading. The
character from the first movie Alice(Jovovich) is also in the city and
helps some desperate survivors out of this city as soon as possible.
There is of course the same old creatures:Zombies,Vicious Dogs,and
Lickers. But this film just not could live up to the first one because
of its lack of gore,suspense,and storyline. The acting,in my
opinion,SUCKED!!! The characters overdid it so much and that annoying
black guy just made the movie worse. One thing that really bothered me
was Alice' so called &quot;invicibility&quot; bull crap.I will admit that there
were some OK scenes every now and then. I'll add in one more thing-that
design for the Nemesis creature was really cheesy looking. So to make a
long story short(too late) this film was poorly made and seemed to
please only teenage morons.My opinion,F+.
