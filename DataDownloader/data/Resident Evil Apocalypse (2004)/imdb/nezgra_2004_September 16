I'm not a heavy movie person (especially in theaters), mainly because
most have me sitting through one and a half, or 4 hours (ahem, LOTR) of
complete boredom, and ready to rip my hair out! But Resident Evil 2 (to
cut the name short and obvious) was a real treat. Some of us have our
'darker' sides, and I can't help but be mesmorized by so-so cutesy
females, hacking down seemingly infinite numbers of (various) zombies,
in the ominous darkness of Raccoon City.<br /><br />My only real annoyance was the fact I live in Toronto, where the film
was entirely shot, and I kept being distracted by familiar landmarks
and buildings. But overall, a great movie!<br /><br />P.S. AVP was a piece of crap!!! My friend and I laughed ourselves
silly. Excorsist was pretty good though. :)
