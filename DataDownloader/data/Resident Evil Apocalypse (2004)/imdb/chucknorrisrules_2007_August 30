OKKKKKKK, ummmmm........Resident Evil Apocalypse....errrrr.....where do
I start with this one? Right. I have to say that this movie is not
without merit. The action is kind of enjoyable, the characters were
pretty good characters, and there are moments where you want to laugh
out loud. But the first film was better. A survival movie to an extent
with a few extra bits added on, freaky looking zombies, and a sense of
intensity.<br /><br />There are a few points wrong with this movie.<br /><br />1) The film begins with zombies in the police station and Jill
Vaneltine going in to zap them perfectly in the head. How could they
possibly arrest zombies? 2) The film&#39;s score was rubbish. The first
film had a hardcore intense rock score. This one had a terrible jittery
instrumental one.<br /><br />3) The zombies didn&#39;t look as nasty or dangerous.<br /><br />4) The director made it oh-so-obvious who the main characters were with
OTT entrances: Jill walks into the police station and begins slotting
zombies, Carlos jumps out of a helicopter and begins slotting zombies
as he drops, hitting every one and kicking the last one in the face as
he lands, and Alice drives a motorbike through a church window before
driving it into a licker, jumping off and as it floats up she shoots it
and it explodes, and....well, you get the idea.<br /><br />5) The action scenes were sometimes visually indecipherable, especially
with nemesis.<br /><br />6) Carlos&#39; buddy was killed too suddenly.<br /><br />7) The director decided to have the dogs blown up with the pathetic
cigarette trick.<br /><br />8) The end action sequence had nemesis and the others attacking the
umbrella guards together in a ridiculously OTT style.<br /><br />9) The nemesis&#39; suspense is ruined by revealing his face too early.<br /><br />I could go on, but there are too many mistakes made. The main reason
behind this is the director, because Alexander Witt is too much of a
techy guy rather than a visionary director type. If it had been done
properly it would be better.
