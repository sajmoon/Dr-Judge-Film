i have seen this movie and i will not comment on it cause there is
nothing to comment on...except for Paul S.Anderson. This guy is an
absolute retard, he ruined AVP well thats tolerable, he completely
destroyed a well drafted story line for Resident evil, it's very
disappointing and annoying but what i cannot tolerate is bringing a
sequel that is worse than the first installment. lets face it anybody
who praises this movie is either one of two things...they like
senseless unrealistic action or is just not a resident evil game
player. i can call myself a veteran of the game (resident evil
1.2.3.code veronica. outbreak, dead aim, you name it the chances are i
have played it)and all i see is an absolute deconstruction of the game
story line Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for making such a
stupid adaptation of the game...God help us!
