2008_March 7 
I really, *really* didn&#39;t like the original Resident Evil movie, so
quite why I decided to pick up a DVD triple-pack of all three movies in
the series I&#39;m not sure. Perhaps I was in the mood for something
stupid; real MST3K fodder for a boozy weekend. Or maybe it was because
it was cheap. Either way, I knew what to expect from rewatching the
first film (basically, nothing) and had even lower expectations for the
sequels.<br /><br />So I was rather surprised that I quite enjoyed Resident Evil:
Apocalypse. It&#39;s not *good*, not by any stretch of the imagination.
Like the videogames on which it&#39;s based, &#39;cheesy&#39; would be as good a
word as any to describe it. But the difference is that the games took
themselves fairly seriously, whereas Apocalypse knows exactly what it
is - a big dumb action movie based on an entertaining but rather silly
series of horror games - and embraces it. So it&#39;s filled with
references to the games, but unlike the first film&#39;s tenuous background
nods they actually play a part in the story... which is just as
nonsensical as the games themselves, but knowingly so (and thankfully
lacking in fetch-quests for emblems!).<br /><br />Witt doesn&#39;t really bring anything especially interesting as a director
(Paul WS Anderson, here only writing and producing rather than
directing, may not be a great storyteller, but he at least has some
visual flair) and the 15 certificate saps any impact from the action -
like the original, it&#39;s a zombie movie with very little blood. But
overall it&#39;s a definite improvement on the first film... which places
it squarely in the &#39;average&#39; category.<br /><br />Will I be surprised again by Resident Evil: Extinction? I guess I&#39;ll
find out soon enough...
