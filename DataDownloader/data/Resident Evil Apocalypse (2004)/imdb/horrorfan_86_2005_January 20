Resident evil 2 by far blows the first resident evil away. I'm not
saying the first one is bad (i still recommend it) but the second one
is better on so many levels. I think the 2nd one does a much better job
of explaining the disease than the 1st. In the 2nd movie, you also get
a wider and more colorful cast. All the cast in RE2 played their parts
very well. The one thing that sets RE2 apart from the first is the
action. RE2 is non stop action from start to finish. You also get a
wider variety of enemies. In RE2, you get a much more varied
environment than in the first movie (which took place entirely in the
&quot;HIVE&quot;). You also don't have to have seen the first one to appreciate
the second movie. The RE2 gives a brief summary of the first movie in
the beginning. The movie is sometimes labeled as horror, but that is
very wrong. The movie is not at all suspenseful, which is one of its
flaws. Overall RE2 is a good action movie that will satisfy your need
for violence. 7 out of 10
