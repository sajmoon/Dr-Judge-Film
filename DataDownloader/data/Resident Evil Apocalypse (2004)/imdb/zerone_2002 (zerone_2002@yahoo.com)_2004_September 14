Paul W. S. Anderson flushes another film down the can... For the first
half of the movie it seemed like it had a chance, though if you've
never played the game you would really be lost by some of the new cast,
such as Jill Valentine. A few newspaper clippings and suddenly she is
an expert on infected people. How does she know about the virus, she
has no real background story unless you have played the game. Even so
she was never involved in the previous film yet she already is aware of
the outbreak. Now Nemesis was the biggest disappointment of all, the
make up effects lacked so much detail, he was the biggest, bulkiest,
and lamest enemy. Unlike in the game he is very slow and dramatic, not
at all frightening. A good opening, a bad corny enemy, cheap ploys from
the game which serve no purpose to the story. I found the movie lacking
in such a high degree, that i would rather watch Return of the Living
Dead rather than Resident Evil: Apocalypse. At least Return of the
Living Dead was a comedy horror that i could laugh at. Gaps, plot
holes, and bad creature effects make this movie, my suggestion wait
until it comes to a Dollar theater at least then you would not have had
to over pay for this failure.
