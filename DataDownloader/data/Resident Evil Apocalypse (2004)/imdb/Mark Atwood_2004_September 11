I went to see this movie because I was attending a friend's weekly
movie outing. That's two hours I wish I had back.<br /><br />It's like watching a video game over someone's shoulder.<br /><br />There are editing gaffs, zero depth characters, boring affect,
&quot;surprises&quot; and &quot;thrills&quot; that are telegraphed far ahead of time. The
plotting was not tight, the set up for a sequel (either movie or
video game) was clumsy and overlong.<br /><br />If you're going to make up a city, don't be so obvious about the filming
in Toronto.<br /><br />And talk about idiot plots, did *nobody* in Raccoon City have a long
distance telephone, an internet connection, or even a ham radio?
