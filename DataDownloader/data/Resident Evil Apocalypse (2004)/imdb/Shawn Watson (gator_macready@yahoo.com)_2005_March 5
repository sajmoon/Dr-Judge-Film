2005_March 5 
There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved
for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days
are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games
will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and
frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will
never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds
playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be
had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer
and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a
Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will
probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm
talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've
already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal
Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but
it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse
is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No
joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.<br /><br />For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even
bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from
being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot
makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even
the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead
people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few
centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus
is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was
only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the
end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games
that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling
nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is
that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really
original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes
from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or
money. Do not even give in to curiosity.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby
EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.
