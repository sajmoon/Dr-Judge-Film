While the first Resident Evil movie is actually watchable - based on a
video game which itself is based on a film-script by George A. Romero
who happens to be a renowned master of horror films - this here, the
sequel, is just another example of the walking abortion that is the
computer-game-to-film genre. (Maybe i just don&#39;t get the concept:
they&#39;re fun to play but what&#39;s the point of watching a computer game on
film?)<br /><br />Said genre is enjoyable only for those who&#39;s IQ is between shoe size
and room temperature. If otherwise you are a remotely intelligent
life-form: move along - nothing to see here.
