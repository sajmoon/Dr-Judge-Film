After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was
expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been
anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel.
Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn&#39;t have any of the things that made
the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror
movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a
lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game,
with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional
background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were
top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles,
did a fantastic job.<br /><br />RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you&#39;re expecting a
horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and
action genres. There&#39;s no character development, the plot is shallow
and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.<br /><br />I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was
also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great
if they&#39;d improved upon the first movie&#39;s many strengths and taken out
just some of its weaknesses.<br /><br />In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly
discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released
next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!
