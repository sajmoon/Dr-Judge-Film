I&#39;m a huge fan of horror movies, sci-fi and Zombie flicks. I&#39;m not a
huge fan of action or gun movies and I hate movies based on games - but
you know what - I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! This movie starts where the
previous one left off, a plague has infected a city causing the dead to
rise and seek to devour the living. Along with that is the understory
is the &quot;end of the world&quot; aspect of how one could contain an outbreak
like this how society would break down and it would seem that the end
of the world is imminent. We have also the intrigue of a powerful
company conducting dangerous experiments with almost complete impunity
and dangering the rest of us. The viewer is left asking the question,
could something almost this bad really happen, perpetrated by our
government, a large corporation, a foreign power, terrorists? To what
lengths will powerful people go in the quest for power or money? The
movie is a great roller coaster ride of trills but also action
characters that you care about, who are not just zombie fodder. The
movie has some great action/fight sequences without being tedious like
many of the karate or Tarrantino movies are these days. Well worth your
time if you enjoy any of the types of movies I&#39;ve described. A must see
for zombie or apocalypse movie fans.
