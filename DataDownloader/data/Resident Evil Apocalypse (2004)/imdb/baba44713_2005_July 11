2005_July 11 
I am really biased when it comes to movies based on computer games,
especially computer games that I'm fond of. When you think about it,
it's very unrewarding to make such a movie - you gotta please the fans,
yet make an entertaining movie for general audience..not an easy task
to do.<br /><br />The main problem for me is, well, things that work in a computer game
don't usually work in the movie. In the game you have a heroine who
runs around as scantily clad as she could be, blasting zombies with her
dual guns, and well, why the hell not? If I have to play about 12 hours
to get to the end, I'd rather be watching an attractive girl then a
beefed up hunky Arnold type guy. But if you have that same character in
the movie, and she still runs after zombies in a top and a miniskirt
AND there is no a convincing explanation why exactly does she think
that's the best attire for zombie-hunting, then it usually looks just
plain silly. But let her wear something else and pretty soon you'll
have fans on your neck (why is she not wearing her trademark miniskirt?
Huh? Worst-game-adaptation-EVAR!!!) <br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse tries so hard to fit as many elements from
the game as it can, be it the characters, the enemies, even the
original cut-scenes from the games themselves. But the problem is that
it does just that - there's no story to speak of, no character
development, no nothing. Just our &quot;familiar&quot; characters running around
killing everything that comes at them. It's not even a good zombie
movie, since zombies are more a part of the scenery now, a distraction
from furious action sequences and explosions.<br /><br />The movie aims to achieve many things at once, but fails on almost on
every note. Is it scary? No. There are some so-so scary scenes, but
nothing worth mentioning (btw one comment speaks of the BIGGEST SCARE
IN 2004 - I must say I didn't see anything even remotely justifying
that remark). The action scenes are intense, but again nothing
spectacular or not seen before. There is comic relief in the shape of
stereotypical &quot;jivey black guy&quot;, a few of the obligatory &quot;oh no, a good
character is bitten and will soon turn into a zombie&quot; elements and
that's it.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of the games, don't see this movie. If you are,
check it out for some familiar references, but don't expect too much. I
mean, sure, Jill Valentine is in it. AND she wears a miniskirt. If you
think it's worth the money for the movie ticket, than go for it. But I
think you'll have much more fun staying home playing through the games
again.
