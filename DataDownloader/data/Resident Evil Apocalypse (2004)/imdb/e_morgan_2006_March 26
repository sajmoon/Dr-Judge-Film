I really enjoyed this movie. There could, however, have been come
changes such as Milla's 100lb. co-star acting like a big bad girl when
a strong wind could've knocked her over, one or two cheesy action movie
clich&eacute; like cocking the shotgun after a phrase when she didn't intend
to use it at the moment, and the motorcycle scene was too far-fetched.
Other than those 3 things I loved this movie!!!! I am so happy that
Milla opted to look the part by packing on some muscle! She looks very
good in muscle, as most women do. I also liked the fact that during
most of the movie you can tell that her hair was barely brushed between
scenes which made her action part look all that believable. When you
see women fighters in movies and their hair is always perfect it annoys
me.
