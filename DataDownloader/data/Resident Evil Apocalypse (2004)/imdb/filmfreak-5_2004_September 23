..well, it's hard to sit down with a good feel watching a film, when
all the criticism you've heard has been hammering it to the ground..<br /><br />I think this film is not at all as bad as many say it is, sure it has
it's flaws and mishaps, but it's an action flick, it's made to
entertain and it does does.....<br /><br />However - talking about a failure in the cast, check out Sienna
Guillory who plays Jill Valentine - she ruined the entire film for me,
I thought her so called &quot;acting&quot; was the worst I've seen in a long
time; stumbles across her lines, absolutely no believability (and
notice how I say &quot;lines&quot; cause she more or less reads them), and...wow,
I know Hollywood has gone downhill, but using this poor excuse for an
actress really does it for me...I truly hope I'll never see her in
another film!<br /><br />Anyway, the third part is in it's way and let's hope that's it, they're
already milking the franchise as it is..<br /><br />5/10
