2005_January 2 
I really wasn't expecting this film to be up to much, especially after
the godawful atrocity that was the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. However,
there was a glimmer of hope on the horizon (some great preview shots of
Sienna Guillory as Jill, and a new director onboard), so I went into
this with fairly low expectations, hoping for some fairly enjoyable
shlock if nothing else. What was so surprising was how well the film
delivered on this and became my favourite &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; movie of
2004.<br /><br />I won't bore you with another recap of the storyline (it doesn't really
matter all that much to be honest, and it's been retreaded a thousand
times in other user comments, so check it out there if you must). All
you need to know is that is basically tries to shoehorn in the plot of
the RE3 game into the foundations set by the end of the first movie,
with game stalwarts, Jill, Carlos and Nikolai joining the fray in the
fight against the Nemesis and the de rigeur zombie outbreak courtesy of
those nice chaps at Umbrella.<br /><br />Looking at this objectively, it's a fairly low-grade piece of
entertainment, but somehow it managed to hit pretty much all the right
buttons and leave me exiting the cinema with that &quot;OMFG!&quot; feeling. The
opening scenes with the outbreak and the subsequent last-stand of the
defense forces was beautifully handled, and matches the feel of the
original RE3 intro very well, with some nice tense firefights to start
things off. Action sequences as a whole are well-handled, and the film
zips along at such a breakneck pace you're seldom left bored. Milla
performs fairly well, as does Oded Fehr as Carlos, but the real
standout is relative big-screen newcomer Sienna Guillory as Jill, who
perfectly personifies the game chara's ass-kicking persona and steals
every single scene she's in with ease. From the first thirty seconds
she's on screen, you want more of her, and the film doesn't disappoint.
I'm a huge fan of the games, and after seeing this film I simply
couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />RE:Apocalypse improves on the original in every way that matters, so
much so that I'd recommend you avoid it entirely and skip straight to
this (there's a handy recap in the intro anyway). Where the original
shied away from the more &quot;adult&quot; nature of the games, this is much more
full-blooded, with just the right amount of blood and profanity without
descending into overkill. Headshots are back, the zombies are meaner,
and it takes a lot more than one pesky licker to put these guys at bay.<br /><br />Okay, it's not without it's weaknesses either. Towards the end the
fight scenes seem to degrade into quickfire editing without any actual
content, just blurs of arms and legs at a hundred cuts per second.
Also, there's possibly one denouement too many at the end, no spoilers
here but let's just say I'd have ended it at the finale of the chopper
scene. But these are fairly small concerns, I'd still recommend it
heartily to anyone looking for a good night's no-brainer entertainment.
