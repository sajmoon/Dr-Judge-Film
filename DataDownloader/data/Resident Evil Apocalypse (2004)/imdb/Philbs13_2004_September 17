The first film was definitely a lot better than this one...as a film
and as PREQUEL to the video games. That film was very good from
beginning to end. Despite the simplistic storyline...it was very
entertaining and well put together. Even the soundtrack was great. <br /><br />As for the second film...I will blatantly say that it was dumb...but
that doesn't at all make it not ENTERTAINING. But what can we expect
without Anderson working entirely on this project and a newbie director
at the helm? Aside from the unnecessary opening commentary about what
happened in the first film, the movie starts out pretty good. The movie
begins to dramatically cheapen after the church sequence, but here's
the reasons why:<br /><br />a) Jill Valentine is a paper-thin character. If you've played the video
games, you know who she is, what happened to her prior to the events in
the second movie and why she was &quot;disgraced&quot; from the STARS unit. In
this film, they don't explain ANYTHING. So basically she's just another
random character dressed like a slut and carrying a gun. <br /><br />b) STARS isn't a special unit in the RPD...they ARE the RPD. I think
this was a huge discrepancy between the games and the movie and goes
along with why they never explained why Jill was disgraced. I think the
writers decided to drop STARS involvement with the mansion incident
completely to avoid a lot of explanation..though they could have sat
down both Jill and Alice in the film and had them discuss things to
bring even the audience up to speed. Instead they briefly mention that
STARS is highly skilled and one of two targets to test out Nemesis on. <br /><br />c) The Church sequence. This section starts out just fine with the
protagonists, even though this is the only time we see any of the
lickers, but then when Milla comes crashing through the window...yeah
it was fun...but what does that have to do with anything? How did she
know there were human survivors in there? She can detect virus
carriers, but the whole city is overrun...why would she come crashing
in there blindly?<br /><br />d) The graveyard was a totally unnecessary sequence. If the town was
overrun with the virus...why would completely intact zombies rise from
the ground in the first place...or all at the same time? <br /><br />e) At first I thought going to the movie that the whole plot theme of
Milla being genetically altered was stupid since she did just fine in
the first film. But as reference to Code Veronica...it's passable.
However, setting her up to fight Nemesis was a total eye-rolling
experience. I definitely wanted to see her confront Nemesis and
remember Matt in the process...but this was totally the wrong way to go
about it. <br /><br />f) The epilogue was totally disappointing. The movie should have ended
with just the news reports about the Umbrella cover-up. All the final
hospital stuff should have been left for the third film...where it
would have been a great opening sequence. It just feels tacked on at
the end here.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my breakdown of what was wrong with the film. It's made
and we can't change it. So needless to say, it was silly, but no less
entertaining. I enjoyed it moreso the second time I watched...since
this time I was just watching for the action and any other references I
may have missed the first time through. Watch it if you enjoyed the
first movie or you like the games...avoid it if you have no idea what's
really going on in the video game-to-movie world.
