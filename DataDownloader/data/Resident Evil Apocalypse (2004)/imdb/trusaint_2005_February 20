2005_February 20 
There is a long list of movies that rode on the back of successful
computer games, all the way to the box office. This is a pantheon that
includes such illustrios titles as &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, &quot;Super Mario
Bros.&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. This movie suits this list perfectly. I
saw the first Resident Evil movie and was delighted to see a film
credible in it's own right. I also saw the second... and that's about
all I can say.<br /><br />Ignoring the game link, there was also the hurdle of the first film.
Not many sequels successfully stand next to their parent, and this one
was inferior by a long shot. Fans of the game will enjoy this film. It
has acceptable portions of zombies, bullets, women and comedy. It is
short of plot, but we don't all look for that in zombie movies now do
we! For those that demand credibility, the power of the mighty umbrella
corperation is ridiculous to the max and, having consulted my
associate, a specialist in the field of combat, the payload of the
nuclear weapon used was nowhere near man enough to clear the city!
