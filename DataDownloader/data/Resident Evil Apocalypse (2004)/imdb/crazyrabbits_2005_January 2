My brother bought this film for Christmas, and even though I tried
watching it with an unbiased opinion, even though I'm a big Resident
Evil fan and big video game junkie...let me tell you..this movie sucks.
In fact, it REALLY SUCKS. Why the hell does Paul Anderson still have a
job? Why was he allowed to have a job? Has he even heard of the words
&quot;character development&quot; or &quot;plot&quot;? If you never played the RE game
before, and you try to watch this film, you will not know what the
blazes is going on. There is NO character development. Zip. Zilch.
Nada. There is also no plot. Oh...go rescue the scientist's daughter?
The one who reminds of that other little hell spawn Newt from the Alien
films? Yeah, I'm developing a REAL emotional attachment there, Paul.
Jill Valentine? She looks like the epitome of every 14 year-old's
deepest fantasy. To top that off, she has no emotion whatsoever. I'm
sure Sienna Guillory was committed to making her on-screen persona as
true to life as her video-game companion, a woman that dresses
incredibly racy and has no facial expressions...champ job! Also, the
fight scenes were incredibly lame. I mean what the hell was that duel
between Alice and Nemesis all about? It looked like something out of a
bad 70's kung-fu movie. To all the people who said this is a good film,
you are in the MINORITY. Look up that word when you have a chance. This
movie sucked, plain and simple.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Go to your video store and rent a GOOD zombie movie, like
the original and remake versions of Dawn Of The Dead, or anything
George Romero made, or even 28 Days Later...the possibilities are
endless!
