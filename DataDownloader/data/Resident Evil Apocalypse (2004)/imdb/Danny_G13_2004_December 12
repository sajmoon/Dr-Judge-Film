I was appalled by the first Resident Evil film. As a big fan of the
games it was based on I hoped for something which tied in with it.
Indeed, George Romero agreed with this philosophy and coined a script
featuring recognisable characters from the franchise, and a similar
setting. This script got him fired and the final movie bore pretty much
no resemblance to the games bar the locale of Raccoon City and the name
of the Umbrella Corporation. If alienating the fans wasn't bad enough,
the actual quality of the picture was quite dismal, and though it was
successful on the name, the film content left the majority of neutral
viewers fairly apathetic, and actual fans mildly annoyed. Bearing this
in mind, the sequel would have to rectify a lot of the mistakes the
first one made, and contrive something far better than the original.<br /><br />They succeeded admirably.<br /><br />Apocalypse picks up exactly where the original left off, with Milla
Jovovich's Alice staggering out of some kind of Umbrella medical
installation to be greeted by the chaos of the town of Raccoon City
under the state of emergency the outbreak of T-Virus has left it in.<br /><br />However, Umbrella have plans to use the situation to their advantage by
way of the Nemesis program, and endeavour to test their bio weapons
within the carnage.<br /><br />Meanwhile the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) members are
still in Raccoon City and trying to escape, but after Nemesis
slaughters a crew of them, it is left to the few remaining ones to try
and escape. They are flanked by Alice who doesn't feel quite herself
any more...<br /><br />Resident Evil Apocalypse succeeds on the vast majority of levels the
original feebly capitulated at. Firstly, and very importantly, there
are far more references to the actual games in evidence. Carlos
Oliveira, Jill Valentine, Nemesis, an Ashford reference; there are more
than enough superficial homages to the games to satisfy the
connoisseurs. Moreover, the 'feel' of the movie is vastly more akin to
the games. Rather than the slightly sci-fi sanitised original which
felt a million miles from the games, this one gets the scenarios and
general ambiance closer to what purists wanted. Also in evidence here
is the fact it's a mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
video games. Jill has her Nemesis outfit on, Carlos from 3 is here, the
underground lab from 2 is featured. There are plenty of game links to
satisfy. Sure, there are some slight modifications to the game plot,
with certain details quite different, but you don't find yourself
holding such facts against the film.<br /><br />Secondly, and crucially, the actual movie itself outside of being
faithful to anything is a genuinely enjoyable tale. Sure, it's hardly
realistic, with plenty of gravity-defying stunts and absurd moments of
combat, but it demands you suspend your disbelief for the duration and
assuming your compliance you'll get a kick out of the action and
explosions et al.<br /><br />Then we have Alexander Witt's far more engaging direction compared to
Paul Anderson's drab attempt in the first movie. Witt achieves an
engaging ride here, always making each scene buzz with life. Never a
dull moment in this one.<br /><br />The cinematography is more than competent as well, with some great
aerial shots and some effective street scenes. You feel part of the
action at all times, and you're certainly never bored. Set layout is
especially good, so good you actually don't notice it.<br /><br />Finally the acting. OK, that's always going to be a weakness here, but
besides the corny accents and overdose of cheesy dialogue the actors do
a decent job of getting on with proceedings. Hell, they even manage to
look like they're enjoying themselves. <br /><br />But this film is not about acting; clearly the narrative is centre
stage. And as a result of a reasonable script, good direction, and
close ties to the game, Resident Evil Apocalypse manages on every level
its predecessor failed at.<br /><br />If you're a fan, highly recommended. If you're not, you will probably
still get a blast out of it.
