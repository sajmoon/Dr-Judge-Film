The action picks up where the first one left off, as the zombies are on
the loose in Raccoon City and it is up to Milla J. and company to stop
them or die trying. Fast-moving sequel has plenty of gore and fighting,
but ends up looking like a bunch of strung-together outtakes from 28
DAYS LATER and DAWN OF THE DEAD, among others. There's even a bit from
ALIENS involving a young Newt-type girl on the run from the zombies.
The acting is atrocious, as it was in the first film, and the script
ultimately goes nowhere. The special effects are flawless, but special
effects alone do not a great movie make. Milla gets nekkid, of course,
which will be reason enough for most fanboys to watch this.
