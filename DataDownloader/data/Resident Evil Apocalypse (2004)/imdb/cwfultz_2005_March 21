I get private messages all the time from people saying that I am way
too lenient with my reviews. All that I really care about is that I'm
entertained, especially if it's a movie that I really want to watch. I
had gotten so sick and tired of everyone telling me about &quot;Resident
Evil&quot; that I decided to check it out. It was like a war. Half of them
loved it and half of them hated it. I was at a friend's house when I
watched it. Sometime later on, I came over and he asked me if I wanted
to watch this one. I didn't really care, figuring it was going to suck.<br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; picks up where the original left off. You
know something is wrong. Something weird is happening to a woman. She
escapes from some weird medical facility and into the streets to find
them deserted. There are still people around, but they are either
hiding, or mindless zombies. The corporation from the original has
unleashed their latest weapon, Nemesis. It is an odd looking creature
that has connections with Alice, our hero.<br /><br />This one was good. It was full of action and I do enjoy action. It
captured my attention long enough for me to watch. It was okay. If
there was a third, I wouldn't pay to see it. I'd just wait till my
friend gets it. Final rating 7/10.
