OK, where to start with this flick? To be honest, if you thought that
the prequel, the first Resident Evil movie was about anything, or you
even had a minor crash with that one I'd prefer you will be never
seeing this one. The director has no clue whatsoever with any
storytelling and even shouldn't be allowed directing anything else in
any future. This poor, poor film has no hint of any quality, and after
seeing this one you truly are amazed where the production has been,
hence having an ad campaign. Special Fx are poor, not one (its over 60
minutes of moving picture!) second of a decent imagination or idea.
Conclusion shortly is afterwards you feel like ripped off, any game,
any movie, any story ever hasn't had a feeling so eager just to get few
bucks and then home! Apocalypse, for you.
