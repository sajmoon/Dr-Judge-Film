I must say that I will not be terribly upset if Paul Anderson never
writes another movie so long as I live. The screenplay was incredibly
cheesy!!! The characters often explained what was going on through
dialogue rather than expressing what was happening through action. It
was also very vague about explaining what was going on in the
storyline. On the upside, the movie had a good Director of Photography.
They did a great job of acheiving the right look and mood of Resident
Evil. Also, I thought that the part of Jill Valentine was very well
casted, she looked a lot like Jill. However, they really should have
gone into why Jill knew so much about the Zombies already and explain
her backstory, because it sort of leaves a blank space for non-fans of
the game.
