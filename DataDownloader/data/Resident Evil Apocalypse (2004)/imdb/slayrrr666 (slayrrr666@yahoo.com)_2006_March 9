&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; isn't as bad as some have made it out to
be.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />With the outbreak of the virus spreading through-out Raccoon City and
everyone is running around trying to figure out what has gone wrong,
everyone tries to leave the city. The only way out is a
military-controlled bridge leading out of the city. When a freak zombie
accident scares Major Cain, (Thomas Kretschmann) he orders Raccoon City
to be sealed off, leaving many people trapped with the zombies and
causing general panic among the citizens. Alice (Milla Jovovich)
wanders around and has found others trapped inside the city as well.
Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Terri (Sandrine Holt) are also
involved in trying to escape, but Major Cain wants to leave no trace of
the infection behind and orders the Nemesis program into effect. Carlos
Olivera (Oded Fehr) meets up with Alice and her crew to make it out of
the city alive before the sanitation occurs.<br /><br />The Good News: This isn't all that bad a film, and I don't get the
criticisms of this film. It does what the other one never thought of
doing-being a balls-out action flick. We get a lot more action
sequences in here than in the first one, and the spectacle of the
scenes allows for some nifty moments. The last twenty minutes are all
action spectacle, and leave no one afraid that the movie will end on a
sour note as the first one did. With loads of high impact stunts and
creative angles, it really never does become boring. The test scenes of
the Nemesis are just as action-packed as the other scenes, featuring a
trigger-happy creature that was made for blowing things up and smashing
into buildings, and it's a lot more action-packed because of it. It's
more of an action film with zombies than a horror film anyway, so for
me this one never really disappointed. Besides the stunts, there's tons
of gun-play also involved, so that also ups the action count in this
one. There's also some great horror elements as well, as the church and
school scenes easily show. Both use the location involved and other
elements to give us some great tension building scenes. The off-screen
sounds, the barely audible growling sounds, and other such techniques
are used to really great effect, and several jumps are achieved from
them.<br /><br />The Bad News: The main thing I want to complain about is the overall
lack of on-screen zombies in this movie. We get several scenes with
them, but nowhere like in others of the type, and we are even told in
the beginning that the zombies are loose, but there's too few scenes. A
couple of illogical plot holes aside also show up, but they aren't too
distracting if you're not really looking for them.<br /><br />The Final Verdict: This one confuses me a little more than the first
one did, but it's still an okay zombie movie. If people stop looking at
it as something that was supposed to advance the genre and instead look
at it with the idea that it's a popcorn action-zombie film, this may
win over a few more people. Look at it with an open heart, it's not as
bad as some say it is.<br /><br />Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity and children in
