I think this is an excellent film to watch.It is really entertaining
for everyone.You have to watch the first Resident Evil to understand
the second one because there are some parts in the second one that are
linked to the first one.Alice(Milla Johovich) plays an exciting part in
this movie.She was injected with something that makes her stronger and
fights off the infection that others are carrying.More and more zombies
walk the street and become more violent towards the community.The
Nemisis plays a great part as he and Alice fight to battle and win.But
there is something else that Alice knows about the Nemisis.....You will
have to watch the movie to find out!
