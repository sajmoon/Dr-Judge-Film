I was actually surprised to see that it turned out to be an enjoyable
experience after all. I just wanted to see some gore, for its been a
long time , but this movie delivered something more than i expected. I
wasn't a big fan of the first but the second had some really good
stunts and visual effects the made the first look really bad.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has a serious career in the action field. Though there
were some funny moments which should have been scary. Kinda started
wondering at the end , whether the movie would finish or just go on.
But they give u a hint on what to expect in the third part. Should be
interesting to see a mutant with mental powers --theheckin
