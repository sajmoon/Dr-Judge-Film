I really liked this movie (and I liked the 1st one) and I've played and
completed all games to date (except Outbreak). It was a pretty sweet
flick. By all means hurl your verbal (yet not so verbal) abuse at me.
Its not without faults though so in the spirit of most of you would be
critics I'm gonna pick out faults rather than focus on the good points.<br /><br />1. During every fight scene the camera was all over the place. Half the
time I couldn't tell who was winning. Bit of a shame cause what I did
see was pretty cool.<br /><br />2. Ending was poor. Why, why, why? The third film will dribble on for
about half an hour because of an ending like that.<br /><br />3. I like Milla &quot;jhidoidhq&quot; (whatever) but who is Alice and why was
such a character ever created?<br /><br />On the plus side however, Jill and the Nemisis looked like they had
been ripped right out of the 3rd game, good stuff.
