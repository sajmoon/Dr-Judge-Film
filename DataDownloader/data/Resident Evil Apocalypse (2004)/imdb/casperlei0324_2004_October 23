When I played Resident Evil on PS console for the first time, I was
scared most of the time. It was very suspenseful and scary, so was the
first Resident Evil movie. In contrast, in the second Resident Evil
movie, the main character, Alice, had total ownage. It kind of reduced
the suspense in the movie, because she was too powerful so that nobody
could actually hurt her.<br /><br />Suspense is a very important element in any Resident Evil movies/games,
but in the second Resident Evil, only the first part of the movie (When
Alice hadn't appeared), was pretty frightening. After Alice arrived, it
turned into a pure action movie instead of a suspense movie. The action
was pretty cool, but I personally prefer more suspense.<br /><br />The graphics were pretty good, and it was really nice to see some shots
that were directly taken from Resident Evil III. Near the end there was
even a shot that was taken from Resident Evil X, Code Veronica. I guess
there will be another Resident Evil movie, and I hope it is as good as
the first one.<br /><br />In conclusion, I gave this movie 7/10.
