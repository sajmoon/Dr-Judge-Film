Well I just saw this movie and since it was a action movie I expected
to be entertained and I did - this is a great movie, with lots of good
action sequences and a few scares. Compared to some of the other
sci-fi/action movies of the year its clearly the best so far (even
better than I,robot).<br /><br />Its funny to read other peoples comments, if they like this movie they
use a few lines to say it. On the other hand, if they hate the movie,
its not really the movie they hate but the director, the writer, the
cameraman or the guy getting sandwiches. I guess the haters deep down
really loved this movie, but need to keep up appearances.
