I can be pretty short about this sequel to 'Resident Evil': it's
terrible. I mean, I was able to find some joy in the first film even
though it made no sense at all. This one makes no sense at all and
misses the ingredients that made the first film watchable. It does
contain a fine looking Milla Jovovich and another actress (Sienna
Guillory) that makes it easier to watch, sort of telling us this film
really is for teenage boys only. Well, the ones older than sixteen
since this is an R-rated film. And it's about zombies, by the way.<br /><br />There are good films about zombies, the undead, the living dead. George
Romero made them, '28 Days Later' or 'Shaun of the Dead' are recent
examples. The original 'Resident Evil' belongs not to this category but
at least it had some moments of suspense and tried to give us a story,
whether you found it stupid or not. Here there is no suspense, just a
little gore, and the story is not really there. The events from
'Resident Evil' were underground in a place called The Hive. After
Jovovich survived it was locked forever to keep the virus that turned
people into zombies. Why they want to keep it I do not know, but let's
not ask questions here. Now they want to reopen The Hive. The Hive by
the way, is located in Raccoon City, a city that can only be accessed
by one bridge.<br /><br />The Hive opens, the virus is still there, including the zombies, and
the virus spreads through the city. Now they quarantine the city and
people who are still in it have to save themselves. The Umbrella
Corporation, the most powerful corporation in the world, is responsible
but will do anything to keep their virus. They have created a secret
weapon, codename Nemesis, a creature that seems to be invincible. Now
the group that includes Jovovich and Guillory have to survive not only
the zombies, but the creature as well. A man can help the group,
navigating them with the help of his computer, but they have to save
his daughter first. Jovovich has a little secret of her own.<br /><br />I realize I have spend too much on the story since it basically is a
group of people walking through a city with zombies popping up from
time to time. They are shot in a stylized action sequence and the group
continues. No fun here I would say. If you liked the first film or the
computer game the film is based on you might find some joy, but you can
do so much better. This film offers nothing we have not seen before.
Here it is always night therefore the action is hard to follow, making
it even less interesting. Don't waste your time on this one is
basically all I want to say.
