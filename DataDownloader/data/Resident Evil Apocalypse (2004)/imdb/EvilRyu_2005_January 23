This movie got balls! Very cool movie...that they stay so faithful to
the games (actualy putting the Nemesis monster on screen!!)is nice.
Only exception is Milas character...but her powers do kind of remind me
of super Wesker in Code veronica. The acting is not good its
okish/hammy but that was never the strong side of the games ether. The
effects are mind blowing,detailed and varied. A lot of old fashion
stunts blends nicely with the modest use of CGI. My personal reason for
liking this better than Resi 1 is that there are a LOT more zombies in
this one! (even zombie kids like in Dawn of the dead!<br /><br />Good job crew! Bring on resident Evil 3! Not a perfect movie but
perfect entertainment! :)
