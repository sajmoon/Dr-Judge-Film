Resident Evil: Apocalypse was...well..interesting. Not necessarily in
the good way. Acting was great. Character development for Alice (Milla
Jovovich) was great. I have said this before and I will say it again. I
do NOT suggest these films to anybody who is a big fan of the games. If
you are a fan of the games, keep an open mind and realize that the
movies don't really have much to do with the games. RE2 had more
continuity to the games then Resident Evil (2002) did.<br /><br />Personal opinion: I preferred Resident Evil (2002) to this movie. It
did make a good 'brigde' to Resident Evil: Afterlife because of the
lack of in-depth explanation. I have dubbed this movie 'The Bridge to
Resident Evil: Afterlife'
