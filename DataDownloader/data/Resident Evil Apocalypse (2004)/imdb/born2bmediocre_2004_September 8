The day before I watched &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; I had spent some
time reading through All of The Threads that Had been Posted - by Fans
of The Games &amp; Fans of The Movies... Having enjoyed The First Film, I
couldn't believe That So Many people didn't enjoy it - based Primarily
on the Fact that It wasn't Exactly like the Games. To All of Those
people whop enjoyed The First Film - I am Almost Positive that You will
enjoy RE 2 for what It Is... For Those Others of You... I am Afraid to
Say That This Film does Capture The Feeling of The Games, a little
better Than the 1st One did, but doesn't Follow the Story of The Games
as I am Sure You would Have Wanted It To. I have Played The Games &amp; am
A Fan - Though Not FANatical. I know the History &amp; did Find Myself
saying, &quot;What The...?&quot; a few Times. This However shouldn't Detract from
The Fact that It is a Fun Movie &amp; Should be Enjoyed by RE Fans &amp; Action
Movie Buffs! Enjoy It Guys - Jill Valentine was Amazing!! &lt;o&gt;
