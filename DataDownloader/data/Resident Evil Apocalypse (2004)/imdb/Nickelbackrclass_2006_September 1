Sure it has its flaws but you have to admit its still a fun movie to
watch! Milla&#39;s acting hasn&#39;t improved but with the addition of Sienna
performance is brilliant and in my opinion the only person who could
play Jill Valentine. The licker&#39;s look really good compared to them in
the first film but that doesn&#39;t make it better. The story is stupid and
at places boring. The scare factor has dropped but the action factor
has improved. This is more resident evil than the first one but it
isn&#39;t as well polished. So over all this is a very Friday night movie
but it isn&#39;t the first one, you cant watch this film over and over and
over again but hey if its cheep its well worth a look.<br /><br />Its Well worth a look at 6/10 or ***. If you enjoyed this review you
may enjoy my Resident Evil review.<br /><br />Thank You And Goodnight.
