Hummmm, What can I say about this movie, I expected a good action movie
with good story line, but, none of it ever happened. I almost walked
out after the church scene where these &quot;things&quot; come to attack, I did
not get where they came from or why they where there! It was as like
the director wanted to insert some actions and inserted another movie
in the middle of his movie, it just did not make any sense to me. <br /><br />It was obvious that this was filmed in Toronto Canada, You see a few
land marks, like the Bank of Montreal building, City Hall, etc.. I
tried to see the CN tower but never did (maybe I was yawning). <br /><br />The only great thing about the movie is they Blow up Toronto with a
Nuke at the end and all the Zombie like Torontonians die. The acting
for the Zombies actually reminded me of the people that live in
Toronto, they walk around just like that in real life!! Especially when
the leafs lose.. hahaha... Go Sens Go!<br /><br />Don't wast your cash, unless you hate Toronto like most people and
would enjoy seeing it blown up!!! (hint: just sneak in in the last 5
minutes of the movie)
