Is it just the Blockbuster edition, or have all the DVDs edited the
scene where she breaks out of the laboratory at the beginning. In the
one I rented she just walks out. In the theatrical version she broke
out.<br /><br />I actually found this film to be a disappointment in contrast to the
first. The budget seemed much lower, and some scenes just seemed
comical ... how do the bodies in the graveyard get infected with the
virus when they are buried many feet below the earth? When she enters
the bike through the church window ... where did the ramp come from for
her to fly in like that?<br /><br />And the shot of the CN Tower was a good touch ... every city has one of
those. ;-)
