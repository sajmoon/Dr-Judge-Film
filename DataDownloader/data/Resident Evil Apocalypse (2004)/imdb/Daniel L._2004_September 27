The first episode was bad, but it had a a little story. This is just
the continuation, which includes zombies till death, an embarrassingly
Milla Jovovich who plays a superwoman with badly dialogues....oh yes,
and no story.....actually not really good for a continuation of
Resident Evil.<br /><br />The new hopefully star Sienna Guillory didn't convince in her valentine
role....one reason, she also had dumb dialogues like Milla. But i think
there's not really one actor, who plays OK...but thats my opinion. The
feeling of the actors were cramped and false, they aren't ideal for
their roles...<br /><br />My vote: 1/10 awful and a not needed movie.<br /><br />D.
