Similar in science-fiction and horror themes as the first RE, but soooo
much better in a way as an action-genre movie. It reminds the first
part, but develops the plot a bit farther now that everybody's out
(including the disease so remarkable in these movies) from the Umbrella
corp. labs.<br /><br />Otherways, a lot in common with other classic scifi-action movies like
the Terminator or/and zombie-movie genre. The only thing I dislike in
this movie is the way it is directed, like the director had lost his
slightest &quot;sense&quot; of filming. The scenes are developed quite typically
and the story goes on slightly boringly (but there's enough action to
make us forget the details) and keep the film interesting.<br /><br />Compared to the first part of series this is somewhat less notorious
from its main plot but more &quot;entertaining&quot; in a way like most follow
ups. Naturally, that's because it is probably made with more money,
more effects, more acting, in short, more of everything. Fundamental
question still remains... will anybody walk out from the theater alive?
