First of all, the film is not THAT bad like all the people say, I can&#x27;t
say it was definitely worth to watch but it was definitely watchable.
The plot, acting were fine to me, and I thought Sienna Guillory, who is
the actor of Jill Valentine was freaking&#x27; hot and fit the film just
fine! <br /><br />However, like everybody say this film got some problem, which can be
concluded as &#x22;level of reality&#x22;.<br /><br />The first, the Umbrella Co. shut down the big gate, which is only way
to escape, and let all the residents in the Racoon City become zombies,
and the government didn&#x27;t even notice it? AND their cover-up for this
massacre is atomic bomb!? They said they would tell the rest of the
world it was explosion of the nu-clear plant, but huge amount of the
residents who watched freaking zombies were already left, so what about
them? capture and kill them too? if it&#x27;s so, why did Umbrella Co. let
the people go through the gate in the first place? that was just
ludicrous. <br /><br />And second, about the Nemesis, people made this film should have
created him by CG because he looks absolutely stupid. The film was made
in 2004 and the Nemesis looks like only he came from 1970&#x27;s cheap
fantasy movie. I don&#x27;t know what to say, his texture of skin? that was
looks so unreal and stupid I just don&#x27;t understand why they could make
very realistic zombies and awesome CG of Lickers, and they made
Nemesis&#x27;s costume which looks like made by 5 years old. that was
absolutely one of the main reason a lot of people hate the film.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t state all of problem because its too many, but like I said in
the first paragraph, the movie was not that bad, especially the plot
was decent enough to watch. So go rent it! just don&#x27;t buy it.
