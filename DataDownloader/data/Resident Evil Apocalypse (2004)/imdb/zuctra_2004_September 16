This is one crap movie, mixing up plot lines, BADLY.<br /><br />a stupid 1980 looking monster, grrrwaaawaaa and of course he remembers
his human side in the end, CRAP<br /><br />where is the gore?<br /><br />the scenes and sequels are so messy that it isn't even interesting
anymore what will happen next.<br /><br />Alice as a super hero with oneliners, &quot;they changed me&quot; , for crying
out loud pathetic.....please take a look at Snake Pliskin, now that's
an idiot who is cool. 3,2, BANGBANGBANG, 1, Draw<br /><br />was looking at it and at 2/3 the movie was finished and then kept
dragging on for half an hour or so it felt like.<br /><br />I could go on and on but that would be even more waste of my time.<br /><br />WHERE DID THE GOOD MOVIES GO, ALL I CAN DO IS LOOK AT IMDb AND RENT THE
OLDIES.......
