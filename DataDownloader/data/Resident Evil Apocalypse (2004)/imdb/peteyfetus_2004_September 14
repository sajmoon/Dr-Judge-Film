2004_September 14 

Probably the worst acting I've ever sat through, and not to mention the
fact that the movie was the worst one I've ever snuck into. If I had to
pay to see it, I would choke on vomit.<br /><br />I've kept a little place in my toilet just for the chunks that I will
have to blow after seeing the commercials for this on TV, and for the
DVD. <br /><br />Please stay as far away from this movie as you can, while you watch Jet
Li's Hero, because that movie rocks...this movie on the other hand,
this movie sucks a lot.<br /><br />I hate this movie and everyone involved in it, and I even hate the guy
who put this page up on IMDb...that's how much I hate this movie.
