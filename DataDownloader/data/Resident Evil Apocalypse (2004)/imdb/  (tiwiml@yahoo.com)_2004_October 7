I'd like to see part of the next movie take place in outer space on
board the space station shown at the end of the movie. I'd also like to
see no more zombies. Let's think thought control, The second mutant to
look normal has already used his ability to free her and pick her up as
we see them all in the car leaving at the end of movie #2. Let's go
next to umbrella's corporate underground city where they go and use
their thought control, causing all who try and stop them to meet the
same fate as the security guard in movie #2. In the underground city
they find the spacecraft that takes them to the space station where the
chairman is hiding from them. He too is a mutant but less powerful when
faced with two against one. More later, Jimmy Meyer
