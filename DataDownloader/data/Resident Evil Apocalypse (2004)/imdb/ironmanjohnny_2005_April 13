This movie made me want to go out and get the next resident evil,
anyone who played the games will love this movie, if you haven't played
the games and are bent on seeing this movie, play the games first then
watch it, I love this movie because they do nemesis justice and so many
scenes relate to the games i love it. The camera angles, the small
details, all straight from the games, a very nice blend between RE2 and
RE3, of course there are a couple scenes that are corny, and a few
confusing plot parts, of the few. But this movie does not focus on
plot, its all action/adventure and it is very entertaining. I guarantee
everyone will love the NEMESIS.
