I'm a big fan of the resident evil games, and i feel that a great
injustice has been done to them by both movies. I saw the first. it
sucked. I saw the previews for the sequel and thought &quot;this looks kind
of cool.&quot; nope. it wasn't. The acting was terrible, the storyline was
incredibly dumb, the fight scenes were OK, but not impressive enough to
pull this movie out of its cesspool. The only cool part was the black
guy. he was funny, they should've just made it a comedy starring him.
That would've been the tits. By the end, I was praying that they would
all die and leave no room for addition, and it seemed that i would get
my wish for a moment, but NO. I'm not gonna spoil it for you, but i
should just to save you time and money and a few IQ points
