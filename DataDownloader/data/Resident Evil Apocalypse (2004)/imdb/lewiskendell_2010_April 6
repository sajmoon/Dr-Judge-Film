I&#x27;m a fan of the Resident Evil movies. They&#x27;re clearly made by people
who are not overly concerned with sticking closely to the video games,
and I think that&#x27;s a good thing. The series boils down to basically a
few action flicks with a sprinkling of zombies and Milla Jovovich. <br /><br />Apocalypse is pretty similar to the other two Resident Evil movies,
only it&#x27;s set in the same city that the second and third Resident Evil
games are in. There are enough familiar names and cameos to keep fans
invested in the plot and its hodge-podge of movie clich&#xE9;s. <br /><br />As ridiculous as it is to see little, 100 pound Milla fighting a 400
pound monster or outrunning an explosion, it somehow works amongst all
the other ridiculous stuff that&#x27;s going on. I love all the casting,
(except for the Mike Epps stereotypical character) and Jill and Alice
are hot and tough enough to keep the movie interesting. Apocalypse is
not frightening or mind-blowing, but I just can&#x27;t help but enjoy a
video game movie that is fun to watch.
