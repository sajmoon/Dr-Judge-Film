I was really expecting something big from Resident Evil: Appocalypse
and for me it delivered big time. I was once again gripped by the RE
franchise and after leaving RE: Appocalypse it made me thinking what
will happen in the third installment now?.<br /><br />The informed you of what had happened after the &quot;incident&quot; in Racoon
City and even introduced new but familiar characters to die hard RE
fans such as Jill Valentine who looked very suited to Valentines role.<br /><br />I wasn't sure on how Nemesis would look and it looked pretty sweet. of
course if you enjoyed the first one like i did then sequels are always
hard to measure up to, but i think they done a good job and gave some
new twists and turns to the movie.<br /><br />The licker's, Zombie Dogs and Zombies them self's looked great like in
the first and the visual effects where awesome.<br /><br />The only reason i had to knock off a point for the second movie was due
to it being cut short just when the movie was really kicking into gear.
The only other thing i didn't like was there was not enough Zombie
footage like there was in the first.
