I was surprised that I enjoyed the first resident evil film, despite
its soundtrack being off pace and lack of character development. This
film starts where it left off with Alice being left in a world of
destruction by zombies. I felt that there was too much emphasis on
special effect shots and slow mo style matrix type martial arts.
Obviously this film appeals to a younger audience, but overdoing it to
make it look cook can wreck its appeal. Jill was a good add in but
there could have been more engagement amongst the characters in
general. Some scenes are pretty dumb at times - the graveyard scene
with the zombies was not scary at all - and usually I&#39;m terrified of
graveyards (imagination takes over!). Overalll, if your in for a
popcorn night after a tiring day, this is the recipe to melt the butter
in nicely.
