I have been waiting very long to see this movie, and finally it hit the
cinema. Many have written very bad reviews for this movie, but the
movie is just the best movie I have seen in this year. It is 100 times
better than the first movie and has so much similar to the Resident
Evil games. The special effect is very nice, and the chock moments are
cool. I like the way the zombies move and all the other
monsters/mutants act (ex Nemesis). Also the whole mystery about Alice,
and how she becomes the T-virus is very exciting. The history in the
movie is just perfect, and well twisted with action and horror. The
movie has also some good episodes of comic sense. This movie is just
perfect.
