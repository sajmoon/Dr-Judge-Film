Well, i never expected a master piece, but i did hope for a Van
Helsing-esque brainless (and bad) but enjoyable film. Sadly it delivers
on neither fronts. The only reason i can see why people enjoyed this
film is because they may have mental problems or be 5 years old.
Seriously there is little to no merit i can give this film. The Alien
franchise was ripped off ridiculously, the direction was sloppy,
characters weren't developed, plot was poor, ending absurd. I'l admit i
haven't played games really at all so wont comment on their portrayal in
the film. The token black guy did make me laugh, if only he wasn't a
walking clich&eacute;. Nemesis looked silly, from what i've seen of him the
game he looks cool, here, he didn't. Another thing, the characters are
the most stupid you'll ever see. EVER. <br /><br />&quot;dont worry, we'll be safe in this graveyard, i cant see any undead
anywhere..... oh wait, no, they're everywhere&quot;<br /><br />Thats how bad it was, they went to a graveyard expecting safety. Also,
for some reason they gave Alice super powers (why?) and Nemesis found
his heart and it was all sooo stupid. Don't pay money to see this film.
I am glad i saw it just because of the video games, without them this
would be nothing
