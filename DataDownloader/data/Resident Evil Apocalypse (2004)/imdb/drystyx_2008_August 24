This is a sort of zombie movie, only unlike the betters ones, zombies
have unbelievable motor skills. The characters are all super powered
brats who have a million weapons at their disposal. This is part for
the course for the &quot;goofy&quot; movies that brats like to stuff down the
public&#39;s throat. This one is no worse.<br /><br />It is also a cigarette commercial. They make sure you see tough
characters smoking cigarettes. I&#39;ve never seen anyone I gym or jog with
smoke a cigarette. I realize we aren&#39;t supposed to fixate on reality,
but we shouldn&#39;t have to be force fed complete garbage, either.<br /><br />Everyone is an acrobat, unless we&#39;re talking about someone who doesn&#39;t
deserve to live. One woman leaps over a car long ways, leaps on top of
a car, and then leaps fifty feet in the air. I warned you it was goofy.<br /><br />The zombies also defy Science. We could almost accept old time zombies
being brainless, but now these new ones have incredible motor skills.
Where from? Again, more goofball crap.<br /><br />A few likable characters keep this from being a total bomb. Clearly not
a good movie, however. Just more goofy garbage that no one can relate
to, and no one can be interested by, except a few computer nerds who
think they have super powers in some Universe.
