i guess this movie is better than the first Resident Evil.there is more
action and a bit of humour,which is sorely lacking in the first one.and
i like the characters more in this one.i think it was a better mix of
personalities.what i didn&#39;t like is the story.this one is more about
the action and there is quite a bit more than the first one.you
know,people getting shot and dying,lots of stuff blowing up,that sort
of thing.sometimes the movie borders on the ridiculous with some of the
stunts they do.plus there is some totally gratuitous nudity that does
nothing to movie the story.don&#39;t get me wrong,i like nudity as much as
the next guy,but it should have some point.anyway,if you&#39;re an action
junkie,you might like this movie.other than that,there&#39;s not much
here.having said that,i do you like it better than the first
movie,because it is not mind numbingly boring,as the first one was.4/10
