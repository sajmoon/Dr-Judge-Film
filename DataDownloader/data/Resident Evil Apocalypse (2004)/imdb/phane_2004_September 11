The story of this movie was good overall. That said, Alexander Witt is
NOT a very good movie director, and this is the fall down for this
film.<br /><br />Action sequence are filmed in a choppy slow-motion way with angle
change every 2 seconds and close-up that are extremely annoying. You
get the impression of watching &laquo;Blair Witch&raquo;... <br /><br />Music-wise, this movie miss Marylin Mason big time. The sound effect
and the music in the first RE was real good and tied everything
together. Here, in RE2, it's a trown together kind of sound track....
Does not fit with the movie and does not follow the first one.<br /><br />BUT... The actors are doing a great job. Super Alice is still the best
but I can see Jill taking more space in RE3 (if it's done!). Nemesis
was a real let down, mind controled by Umbrella, he is nothing more
than a killing puppet. I fear the same thing will happen to Alice in
RE3.<br /><br />All in all, a nice movie. Not better than the first one. PLEASE bring
back Paul WS Anderson as a director for RE3, or anybody with more
talent than Mr. Witt. (6/10)
