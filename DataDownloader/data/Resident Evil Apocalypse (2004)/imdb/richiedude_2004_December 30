This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I loved the video
game, but this movie sucks more than Hoover and Electrolux combined.
Eureka! About 30-45 minutes in I realized what I have been watching
didn't even have a point or a plot. Then when a weak plot finally did
develop as the movie reached it's abysmal attempted climax I totally
predicted what would happen and how. Pretty freaking weak.<br /><br />This movie was a waste of the rental fee I spent to see it. I should
have added a couple more bucks to it bought a twelve pack and got
totally fucked up. At least I would have accomplished something in the
end.
