into a larger battle when the zombies and mutant dogs have escaped into
Racoon City. She teams up with members of the S.T.A.R.S. team including
Jill Valentine (Sienne Guillory) and Carlos (Oded Fehr) and others to
find and save the missing daughter (Sophie Vavasseur) of Dr. Ashford
(Jared Harris), who created the T-Virus. They also must battle the
Nemesis, a new creature created by the Umbrella Corporation which is
assigned to kill each of the S.T.A.R.S. team and Alice.<br /><br />the good: More fun action! Again, I don't play videogames so I probably
enjoyed everything more then the people who did.<br /><br />I love Alice in this one and I love her powers. I also love Jill and
Carlos, great characters and I hope fans of the videogames like it as
well. The pimp dude was also funny.<br /><br />I also liked some of the settings for the action, including the church
and the cemetery. Great action scenes! The Nemesis was awesome. It's
look and fight scenes. I also love how Alice remembers Matt.<br /><br />One last thing, the ending! Left you hanging and guessing and begging
for the finale of the trilogy! the bad: Just the reporter, I mean come
on, what was her point? 9/10
