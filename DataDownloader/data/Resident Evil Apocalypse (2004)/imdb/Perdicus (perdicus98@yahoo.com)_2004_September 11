I must confess; I am a huge &quot;Resident Evil&quot; fan. I got hooked on the
games first, saw the first movie &amp; got the DVD. Now, with &quot;Apocalypse&quot;,
the video-game-to-movie genre has (IMHO) reached its' zenith. &quot;Alice&quot;,
the heroine of the first movie, awakes to find Raccon City swarming
with zombies (and more), while the REMFs at Umbrella Corp. coldly
observe the chaos from afar, calculating the money they can make with
the T-Virus.<br /><br />We finally meet the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad), most
notably Jill Valentine, who is sporting a blue tube top and black
miniskirt--straight out of &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;! Oh, and speaking
of the Nemesis, he's here, too; what was left of Matt from the first
movie has been transformed into a hulking bruiser who carries a rocket
launcher *and* a Gatling gun! Oddly enough, the movie sort of humanizes
the Nemesis near the end (you'll see).<br /><br />Overall, this was a very good movie, much better than the first one,
with an ending that sets up (hopefully) another sequel! OTOH, once
you've used up &quot;Apocalypse&quot; in the title, where do you go from there? I
hope we'll find out! My rating: 8/10.
