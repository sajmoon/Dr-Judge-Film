Picking up at the end of the first movie this film tops whats gone
before, but at it heart is a decidedly empty center.<br /><br />The plot begins with the evil corporation going back into the Hive
complex that was the setting of the first film. They are unprepared for
what they find and are almost instantly over run by the walking dead.
The dead spill out into the city above and it becomes a fight for
survival.<br /><br />This film moves better than the first film. Certainly the handling of
the dead and the mutants is infinitely better. The action scenes are
first rate, the performances are very good, in fact this film has
everything to be considered &quot;Dawn of the Dead 2&quot; except a real plot.<br /><br />Thats the rub, for the first half hour there is no real plot only
introductions of characters. The second half hour the plot finally
kicks in, but by that time I was a bit too distanced from it to care.
Essentially the plot has to do with this band of people trying to get
out of the city by rescuing the daughter of one of the scientists
responsible for the whole mess. The corporation behind it all has their
own plans and it becomes a three way battle, good guys, corporation and
monsters. If only there had been more to the script, then we'd be
talking classic here.<br /><br />I don't know. I gave the film a 6 out of 10, but its probably better
than that, I'm just awash in serious disappointment because whats good
is so good, that I wanted more behind it.<br /><br />Try it and decide for yourself.
