When I say thriller, i mean its like Jacko&#39;s 80&#39;s video, not any kind
of enjoyable film. Let me start by saying I thought the first movie was
acceptable. It wasn&#39;t brilliant, and it wasn&#39;t what most of the fans
wanted, but I thought it did a good job of painting a picture of the
umbrella corporation and the way it works. (Why the computer couldn&#39;t
just inform them of the virus outbreak remotely though i wonder, but
thats another film) Anyway, getting back to RE:A, what exactly was the
point of this film? I&#39;m writing this in utter disbelief after reading
some of the other reviews. Terms such as &quot;excellent action sequences&quot;
and &quot;non stop adrenaline&quot; are used frequently, but i wonder what film
they refer to. Certainly not apocalypse.<br /><br />The action is jumpy and blurred, much like the car chase from the
Bourne supremacy which spoilt the whole film. The camera so rapidly its
impossible to tell what is going on. I wanted to see shotguns blowing
heads off, zombies getting decapitated etc. Sure its gory, but hello
Anderson; its a f***kcing zombie film, thats what we want.<br /><br />Resident Evil has got a better storyline that most zombie films with
the first film spending a lot of time explaining to us the whole
Umbrella Company, and this is fine. The start of the film even showed
promise, until they went into the Hive. (Why would you? why why why
without at least 50 armed soldiers) But we already know about that,
there&#39;s no need to cram so much weak plot that there is no room for any
action. We don&#39;t want to see the Umbrella bosses, its a faceless
company and thats how it should stay. I&#39;m not going to point out the
plot holes as I&#39;ve only got 1000 words in which to do it.<br /><br />Get James Cameron for RE3 or don&#39;t bother.<br /><br />A poor film.
