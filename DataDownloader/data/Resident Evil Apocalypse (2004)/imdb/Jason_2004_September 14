This film is entertaining, no matter how low-brow or clich&eacute;. Way better
than I thought it would be. I thought it would be like Batman &amp; Robin
bad. It wasn't. You will not be bored or mentally scarred by poor
craft. In fact, it's so stupid and clich&eacute;d that one could just be
entertained by laughing at it with your smart friends. That's what I
did.<br /><br />It sort of weaves in and out of cool, suspenseful moments, and then
back into the worst acting in recent cinematic history.<br /><br />There seemed to a different accent for every character. It's completely
ridiculous. I had to laugh at that. <br /><br />Every character is a rip-off of a character we've all seen before. The
street-wise black guy character is a complete clich&eacute;' and an obviously
inserted &quot;comic relief&quot; character, but for some reason, he actually
manages to be funny, and not in an unintentional way.<br /><br />The plot was actually kind of cool. It got me into it...a little. It
was a rip-off of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, but it worked for this film.<br /><br />Also, we get to see one or two original zombie scenes. When is the last
time you saw a group of zombie children?<br /><br />Great combination of action, horror and funny bad acting! It's the
unintentional comedy of Troll 2, crossed with John Woo and George
Romero.<br /><br />6/10 for entertainment value.
