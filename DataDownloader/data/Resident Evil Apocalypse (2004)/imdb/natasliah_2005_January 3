This movie deserves nothing less than a 10. The people who put this
movie together, took the Resident Evil saga (in which every game was an
fragment), and created a complete movie. In every single Resident Evil
game, you were automatically the underdog. The camera angles weren't
very likable, and neither was the hand to hand combat or the voice
acting. Example of bad voice acting: &quot;Jill...don't open that door!&quot; &#150;
Resident Evil Director's cut. In the first movie, Alice was a force to
be reckoned with, and now the undead have a more evolved Alice to deal
with. The first movie took place in the Hive, whereas this movie takes
place in many parts of Raccoon City. All in all, I'd prefer this movie
over the first one any day. If you love the undead from the RE games,
if you love fear, or if you just love Milla Jovovich, I recommend that
you check this movie out! And after you see this movie; be sure to buy
the CD Divine Comedy by Milla Jovovich anywhere CD's are sold.
