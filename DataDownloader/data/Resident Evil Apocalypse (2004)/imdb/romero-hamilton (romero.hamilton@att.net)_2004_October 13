Let me be the first to say I'm already in love with this movie, I been
a fan of the game since the very first game, I must say the movies
aren't based on the game but who give a damn let me say if the movie
were based on the game then the movie would be boring as F@#* you would
already know what to expect and u would'nt waste your time on a movie
like that I notice that Paul Anderson is trying to keep fans on there
toes by these cool endings example Resident evil(the Hive)at the end
Alice wakes up and brake out of the hospital and stands in the middle
of the street and it ends. Now that left me wanting more and more is
what I got out of Resident evil Apocalypse. And at the end of that
movie it left me wanting more why because I had so many ?s at the end
and i hope some of u will tell me like since Matt(Nemesis) also has the
T-Virus in him can he still be alive next ? Why did Alice doctor let
her go at the end?. Now as for you fans who want to see Chris, Claire,
Wesker etc. just wait until the next film. It may be out in 2006 or
2007 so just give it time and please answer my questions.
