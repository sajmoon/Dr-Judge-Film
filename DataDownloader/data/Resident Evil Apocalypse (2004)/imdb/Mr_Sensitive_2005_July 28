I'm the fan of the first movie and the game but this movie is nothing
compare to both. It was sort of the disappointment cause it look so
good in the trailer. This movie has lost its believable story and style
that the first movie was built on.<br /><br />It is not all that bad, if you look in the action movie wise and not
comparing it to the first. The movie picking up where the end of the
first movie left off. They have done a good job with the Nemesis makeup
and costume, really look like in the game. And Milla did look hotter
than the first movie.<br /><br />The casting and acting of this movie is very average (though, much
worst than first movie). This time there is hardly any dialogue. They
concentrate too much on how the character in the movie should be like
the game rather than trying to develop more realistic storyline.<br /><br />Anyway I have to warn that if you're planning to watch &#150; expect more of
an action fighting rather than zombie movie. Also expect the cheesy
ending (unlike the first) and also tacky battle scene that you normally
seen in Mortal Kombat and Kick Boxing movie but uses here between
Nemesis and Alice.<br /><br />The most disappointing of all in this movie was - there're hardly any
Zombie.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, But Don't Expect It To Be As Good As The First.<br /><br />Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)<br /><br />Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks
