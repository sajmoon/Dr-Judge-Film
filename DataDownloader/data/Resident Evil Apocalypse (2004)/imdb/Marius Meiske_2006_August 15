Wasn&#39;t Resident Evil supposed to be a Horror movie? Wheel, the game
was/is/will be horror. But this movie is more an action comedy than a
horror movie. Why comedy? I tell you why!<br /><br />- Before the film really starts, we see Jill Valentine getting her
Video game cloths on and heading to the R.P.D. - Many zombies are kept
here and nobody knows what to do. except Jill. Bang, Bang, Bang -
&quot;They&#39;re infected.&quot; And the poor music in the background....Shame on
them. And why does it have to be always hard rock or metal or crap like
this. <br /><br />- When Mr. Ashford gets informed that he has to leave, you&#39;ll hear him
speak the first time (&quot;You do what you have to do, I do what I have to
do&quot;) - His voice is f***ed up! <br /><br />- The man who leads the Umbrella operation is obviously German or
Russian or something like that. His English is weird. &quot;Nemesis is now
fully activated&quot; :D:D:D:D<br /><br />- When Alice crashes into the church and kills the Lickers...well, just
watch the scene. Funny as hell. <br /><br />- LJ (the black guy) - He is really funny. Not unwanted funny like the
scenes before. I mean really funny. Good acting. But in the wrong
movie. Better put him in the sequel of &quot;Soulplane&quot;. <br /><br />- At the end, Nemesis and Alice fight together...<br /><br />The rest is good action and a bit of Resident Evil. I think, Christophe
Gans should have done this movie. <br /><br />Enjoy!
