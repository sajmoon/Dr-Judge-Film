The only difference between the two films is that one is pretty awful
the other is amazing. One thing that is bad about it is that it&#39;s one
of those poor American horror films. For instance they use guns all the
time instead of DIY Tools. The DIY tools are much more realistic. One
stupid thing is that one on one fights with zombies. Good in video
games but stupid in films. I always taught the games story line was
stupid. And thanks to the film it proved that i am right. What&#39;s the
point on having a single company turning an entire city into a zombie
infested city without the government knowing. Also it&#39;s a company with
an entire army. The story also makes no sense.<br /><br />Besides a few scenes to give you a little thrill nothing in the film
will stop you from yawning and complaining. Hopefully future films off
video games would be better or unleast the cast and crew can make a
better attempt.
