I really liked the first one, but they seem to have gotten it all wrong
on this one.<br /><br />The story does not really have a clear structure but is very
predictable anyway. Additionally, most of the characters are pretty
flat and the attempts they made to discuss a bit of ethics or morality
failed terribly. While in the first RE they had some ambiguous
characters on the verge between good and evil who develop during the
movie, the division between good and bad is extremely simple and
profane in RE-A. They couldn't keep up the frightening atmosphere which
was just so great in the first part but tried to go with some slow-mo
pictures which merely remind of some really cheap B movie. And to top
it off, a lot of elements are clearly stolen from other movies, without
really being references.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is great again, but everything else in this movie just
spoils the opportunity to enjoy her performance.<br /><br />All that one can hope for is that there will be no further sequel,
although one has to fear this could happen someday. Which finally at
least gives one scaring aspect to this movie.
