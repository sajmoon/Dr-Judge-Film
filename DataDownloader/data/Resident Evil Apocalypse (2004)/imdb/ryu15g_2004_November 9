Alright, to start off, this is coming from a guy who has never played
Resident Evil, however, friends are a great sorce of information. From
what they have said, everyone was given a heads-up that not EVERYTHING
from the game was going to be in this movie. Some things were gonna be
added, some weren't going to be in there, and some based on the game
were put on there. My RE friends liked the movie, knowing
full-heartedly the outcome of what was going to happen. But from a
person who never played the game, I have to say that it was well done.
I like the writing (Mike Epps stole the show, by the way), the
directing was good. All in all, not too shabby. But, if you're a RE
player, don't take my word for it. If you haven't played the game,
check out the movie and see what you think.
