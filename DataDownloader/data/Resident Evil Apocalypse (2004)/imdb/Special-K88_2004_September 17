Fast-paced sequel picks up where its predecessor left off, returning to
a city where now all residents have been infected with a biological
virus that turns them into flesh-eating zombies. A handful of survivors
rally together to try and escape before they&#x27;re wiped out by the
shadowy company responsible for the outbreak. Better directed than the
first film, with some eye-popping action scenes/stunts, but the camera
work borders on epileptic and some of the dialogue is extremely clumsy.
Jovovich is in fine form, adding a burst of energy every time she&#x27;s on
screen; Guillory and Fehr (of Mummy fame) have effective roles as
hardened police officers, and Epps makes his mark as a wisecracking
civilian. An okay way to pass the time on a no-brainer level, though
the ending is nothing to get all excited about. **&#xBD;
