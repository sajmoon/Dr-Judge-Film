Picking up immediately where Resident Evil left off, Apocalypse sees
Umbrella Corporation employee turned zombie ass-kicker Alice (Milla
Jovovich) waking up to discover that the &#x27;T-Virus&#x27;, which can reanimate
dead cells, has spread from underground facility The Hive to the
surface, transforming much of the population of Raccoon City into
ravenous zombies. With the quarantined city scheduled to be nuked,
Alice&#x27;s only chance for survival is to join a small group of survivors
in a mission to locate the daughter of a top Umbrella scientist, a job
made even harder with Project Nemesis, a massive mutant toting a
mini-gun, loose on the streets...<br /><br />Sometimes it&#x27;s so hard to find the right words to convey my feelings
about a film that it takes me as long to write my review as it took to
watch the bloody thing in the first place. That&#x27;s one reason why I love
the Resident Evil films: they&#x27;re such pure, mindless, popcorn
entertainment that I don&#x27;t have to struggle when it comes to typing up
my thoughts. In Apocalypse, there&#x27;s tons of zombies, which equals fun.
There&#x27;s Milla Jovovich looking fit and shooting big guns, which equals
fun, plus we get a second babe in the form of sexy cop Jill Valentine
(Sienna Guillory). And there&#x27;s mutants and blood and explosions and
kung fu and zombie dogs and scary stuff and cool effects, all of which
means even more fun.<br /><br />See... that was easy peasy&#x97;no need for me to even use the thesaurus!
