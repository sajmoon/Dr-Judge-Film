RESIDENT EVIL was an engrossing, intelligent thriller with a solid
story and likable characters. Lots of twists and turns, with the story
constantly taking you to unexpected places and some really dynamic and
original special efx. Much more than I ever expected from a movie based
on a video game.<br /><br />R.E. APOCALYPSE is an exercise in style over substance. More proof that
digital editing plus digital efx equal digitized boredom. I watched
this with two friends, and twenty minutes into it we all concluded that
it was a huge pointless waste of time.<br /><br />Horror films are not expected to be Shakespearean drama at its best,
but you should care about the characters enough to get sucked into
their journey and enjoy a vicarious, and hopefully cathartic,
experience for your money.<br /><br />This movie was EMPTY. Soulless. The action scenes were a mess of crappy
swoosh pans. There was not one drop of genuine suspense or danger. Zero
character development, except for the embarrassingly racist &quot;Uncle
Buckwheat&quot; character who proclaims (with anachronistic glee) at one
point, &quot;I usually drive a Cadillac.&quot; <br /><br />Rarely have I been so fully and painfully aware of wasting precious
minutes of my life as when sitting through this snoozefest, hopefully
waiting for it to show some semblance of intelligent story development.
Instead I got lame snatches of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;
(right down to Lara Croft's costume, weaponry and personal style),
&quot;Robocop&quot;, and other movies and comic book imagery.<br /><br />The visual efx were flashy and impressive. Sadly, the only thing they
conveyed was how much money must have been wasted on this garbage. I
can only hope that the lovely and talented Ms. Jovovich banked some
serious scratch for whoring herself in this turkey.<br /><br />The only positive which came from watching this movie is that we all
agreed to take note of who wrote and directed it, to studiously avoid
their efforts in the future.
