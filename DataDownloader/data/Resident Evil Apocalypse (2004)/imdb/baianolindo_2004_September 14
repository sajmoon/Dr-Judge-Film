I planned to jump from the Golden Bridge today but went to see Resident
Evil this morning instead. Bad choice. You know, I've always been in
love with the motion picture magic so I said, nothing could be worst
than my failed life. O, how wrong I was and oh, how grateful I'm to
realize that am living a dream in comparison to the constant, stupid,
incoherent nightmare of that guy who did it...<br /><br />It took great deal of courage, unbelievable stupidity of the money
people to give a bundle for such moronic script and complete lack of
respect for the public to make such garbage. Some Umbrella, not from
Singin' in the Rain, is an Evil Empire that mess up the world, the
world goes berserk, people are eating people, blah blah blah. You know
what the movie is all about &#150; nothing.<br /><br />Only when one blessed soul in the movie theater started to laugh out
loud I realized that this is the comedy. Screwball, very poorly
executed, but still a comedy. If you try to take any single part of
that cretinoid so called movie serious you'll be bored to death. <br /><br />Hope 'Nemesis' of this waste makers would visit them in the dreams.
