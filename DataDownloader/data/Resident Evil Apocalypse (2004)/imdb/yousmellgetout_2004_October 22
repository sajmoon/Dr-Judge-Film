I thought this movie was great. Everything about it was great, really.
The acting was superb, given the video game dialog they had to say. The
directing was amazing when you think of how the last story ended off
they didn't spin it into a whole different direction. The summary
stayed true to the video game for the most part and the C.G.I didn't
look fake or stupid. I thought it was great how they introduced Jill
Valentine though I was upset they didn't say more about why she was
suspended from the S.T.A.R.S in the first place. All in all I would
encourage anyone to go and see this movie. It had action and gore and a
great story that unfolds as you watch and enjoy.
