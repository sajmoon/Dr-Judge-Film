Two years after the original came out, they made a sequel called
&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse.&quot; Even though it was much better than I
expected (with a plot that was a LOT more coherent and less dumb), its
action was a lot more unbelievable than the action in the original.<br /><br />In this one, the T-virus has escaped from 'The Hive' and is now running
rampant on the streets of Raccoon City, turning people (and, once
again, some dogs) into vicious, flesh-eating zombies. Milla Jovovich
returns as security operative Alice who, with a group of survivors,
agrees to find the daughter of Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) who is
trapped within the city limits.<br /><br />The movie was a lot of fun, just like the first. Paul W.S. Anderson's
script was well-written (although the ending was a little
unsatisfying). Instead of Paul W.S. Anderson, Alexander Witt stepped
into the director's chair for this one (he appears as a sniper who
works for the Umbrella Corporation towards the end).<br /><br />Overall, as good a sequel as the filmmakers could have made (just don't
look for any logic).
