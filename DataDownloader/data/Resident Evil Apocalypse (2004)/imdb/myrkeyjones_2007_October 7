Great sequel, though i did only watch the German extended edition i got
over ebay. Extended by over 5 min&#39;s, what a difference, more gore, more
consistent editing, better story flow. It continues the story from the
first film and sets up brilliantly for Resident Evil: Extinction. The
atmosphere is spot on, its moody, there is so much action it is almost
exhausting. In either case i enjoyed the German version much better
than the western cut. There is not much really left to say, only that
this trilogy is going strait onto the cult shelf, its all about chicks,
guns and monsters. It doesn&#39;t waste its time trying to patronize us,
just simple fun with likable characters, and great lines. Pure trash
fun.<br /><br />Recommendation: Get the German cut!!!!!
