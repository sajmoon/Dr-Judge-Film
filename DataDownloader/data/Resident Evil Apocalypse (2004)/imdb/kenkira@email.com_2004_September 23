Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say
this:<br /><br />What a LOAD!<br /><br />Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if
you want an excuse to create a big budget,
blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.<br /><br />I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He
doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking
Joss Weadon cliffhanger.<br /><br />Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able
to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like
something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end
of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not
EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the
future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a
cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it
did end and I would have been less irritated.<br /><br />The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila
Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down
playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your
highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of
the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to
understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns
blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a
blazing flurry of F-Words.<br /><br />It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think
garnered the &quot;R&quot; rating, which is pretty flipping sad.<br /><br />All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one
guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that
feeling of &quot;Aw, man, I really liked him/her too&quot;.<br /><br />Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not
a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with
it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the
baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia
filled dude with the attitude.<br /><br />The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to
flash back at them, as if to say &quot;Oh yeah, they're here too&quot;. The
Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had
guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving
and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're
thinking, &quot;Holy crap, they're screwed&quot;.<br /><br />Not necessarily so, Lois.<br /><br />Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over,
blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).<br /><br />Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that
only seems to be THERE) and one of our &quot;Zombie Reminders&quot; shine as a
bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with
Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie
Boogaloo.<br /><br />Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived
than the NON reason the movie gave.<br /><br />Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them
all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your
butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just
kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing
very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice
that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot
Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just
shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was
going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were,
more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.<br /><br />All of this combined makes me want to se the possibility of a three as
much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.<br /><br />Very Little.
