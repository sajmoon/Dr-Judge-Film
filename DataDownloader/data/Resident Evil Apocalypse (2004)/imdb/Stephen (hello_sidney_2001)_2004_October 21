I beg to contradict anyone who thought that this follow up was rubbish,
if you liked the original then you will like this one. If you are a fan
of the games the you will be pleased to see that they have introduced
Gill who was the main Character in Resident Evil 2 the game. She kicks
ass in the movie but is nowhere near the league of Alice (Milla
Jovovich) Who has been genetically enhanced by the T Virus, she is one
of the only people to not be mutated by the virus, and shows great
results, in her agility strength and stealth.. All in all making her a
great killing machine... which means we get what we want.. lots of
exciting fighting scenes with Milla.. (She also manages to get her kit
off again)<br /><br />I'd rate this film 10/10 for anyone who's an R E fan, not these
wannabes who think they know everything about film..<br /><br />Thank you for reading :D
