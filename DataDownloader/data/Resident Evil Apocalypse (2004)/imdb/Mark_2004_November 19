First,I'll state the obvious:If you walked into Resident Evil:
Apocalyspe expecting some cinematic masterpiece,You where obviously
Dead wrong.Residet Evil: Apocalypse is a rather dull CGI action feast
that has a lose script,Bad acting,Unorigial Directing and Annoying
editing.<br /><br />The film finds the very beautiful Alice(Milla Jovovich) escaping the
lab(Where a large amount of the original took place) And finding the
deserted streets Of Racoon city.Of course its that naughty Umbrella
Corporation's fault!Anyways,Most of the city Residents have been turned
into flesh eating walking dead.Scantly clad Gun toting Alice (Who is
discovering she has super powers) Meets up with another group of
survivors, Lead by Jill Valentine(Sienna Guillory) Who somehow already
knows how to kill the zombies.Anyway,A worker for the Umbrella
Corporation, Dr.Ashford(Jared Harris) is missing his daughter Angie
(Sophie Vavasseur).He calls the survivors and tells them if they save
his daughter, He will let them out of the city.<br /><br />Milla J is very hot, And its fun watching her battle her way through
zombies, Umbrella Emoployers, More killer dogs, And of coarse Nemisis.I
have to say, Watching Nemisis was fun, But the final battle between him
and sweet little Alice was lame.The editing was terrible,You could
hardly see what was happening!And speaking of Milla, Her acting has not
improved a whole lot since the original...<br /><br />But Whe you watch a film like this,Do you aspect wonderful acting?Of
course Not!You expect hot girls, Loads of CGI, And some cool action
scenes, And throw a comic relief Black guy into the mix.Some of the
action scenes were cool though, And loads of fun.Milla And Sienna are
both beautiful,And the film basically provided great Eye Candy.<br /><br />But then come the negatives.Alexander Witt's directing is fun, But SO
unoriginal.Paul W.S. Adreson's script is bad, It doesn't seem to have
much of a plot,Just some cool action scenes.Milla gives a bad, But not
terrible performance ,And Sienna is just standard &quot;action movie tough
girl&quot;.The film is actually a little boring sometimes, And little to No
Character Development, Only one time did I feel sad when a character
died.<br /><br />Another negative:They never established the Apocalypse enough.And then
there's that ending...<br /><br />Overall: 4/10
