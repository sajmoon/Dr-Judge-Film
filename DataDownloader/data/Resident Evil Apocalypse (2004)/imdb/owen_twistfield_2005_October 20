An average 5.7? Could this movie have been better I wonder? Well it is
though. The challenge is that the movie is both a sequel and an
adaptation of a video game. The latter actually goes with a note: I
suspect RE to be an sort of adaptation of night/dawn/day of the living
dead. This being said I laid bare one of main weak points: human flesh
eating zombies. They are so run-of-the-mill you need a good twist to
make the audience raise an eye lid. However, the movie hardly makes an
effort to do so. <br /><br />But how do those other guys do it? Romero uses gross shock effects with
twisted humor in his (living) dead movies. Neither of these are
abundance in this movie. Carpenter uses desperation and a feeling of
weakness and insecurity(the thing). These are only vaguely used. Some
stories rest on the sadness in losing people(Stephen king: Salem's
lot). Well on rare occasion we see people being interested in the fate
of others. (Who is that guy over there being eaten alive? Oh him, just
one of my fellow troopers.) Some use a joyful almost childish humor
(lost boys, fearless vampire killers). But this is not to be seen here.
Some use the clean inhuman chilliness of advance science (Ash(the
robot) and Mother(ship's computer) in Alien, HAL2000(ships computer
again) in Space 2001). We are missing that here too. It looks to me
that almost that the writer(s) and director shy away of going one step
further. To make the movie stand out, to make it a little bit more
interesting. The result is a fast paced action movie with though people
and lot's of explosions and guns, zombies, some other monsters and evil
scientists. And it's not strange to do so: this way you aim at the most
people and it's the safest bet on a wide sale.<br /><br />Could the movie have been better? I imagine it could have been, with
more sick humor, and more chilliness and more feeling. A slight change
of the script. It might have resulted in a 7 and from the IMDb audience
that is quite lot.<br /><br />Owen
