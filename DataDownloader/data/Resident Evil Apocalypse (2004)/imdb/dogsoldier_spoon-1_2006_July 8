hello my dears, (spoilers a head and sorry for the language)<br /><br />to be fair, I really thought this movie would be a great one. I wanted
to see it in theaters, but unfortunately I didn&#39;t have the time. When I
first saw this movie I was glad I didn&#39;t paid a ticket for this. Here
are the reasons why:<br /><br />there are few good points about this movie. The acting wasn&#39;t all that
bad and at least they tried to make it good but they failed. The script
was totally horrible! Many dumb and ridiculous things were in it and
let us not forget those horrible - yet typical for American movies -
lines like: &quot;stay!&quot;. Honestly, who says that against a zombie dog?<br /><br />For those who enjoyed resident evil: nemesis (the game) you will be
shocked and p!ssed off. The great characters featuring in that game
have been translated to the big screen in a horrible way. you won&#39;t
even see your favorite characters like Carlos, Nicholai or Mikha&iuml;l.
There is a Carlos and a Nicholai in the movie, but the only thing they
have in common with their superior game characters is a name.<br /><br />and let&#39;s not forget how they Sc&#128;wed up one of the fan&#39;s favorite
enemies. Yes indeed, Nemesis. In stead of the big, great monster we
here have a big zombie that gets defeated by a thin, small girl... in
hand combat! Other then that he even has feelings, no tentacles but a
machine gun and he can actually scan people. Other then this he
actually looked like Nemesis but that&#39;s about it.<br /><br />The acting wasn&#39;t that bad but it wasn&#39;t good either. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s
the fault of the actors but the script really made them look bad. The
most horrible character of this movie must be Jill Valentine. What was
once a great, sweet but still kick-as heroine now turned into some
boring, ridiculous, dumb *****.<br /><br />Many people say it&#39;s so much better then the first but I do not agree.
The first one had nothing to do with the game, in the second one they
destroyed the game completely. The first one had better action, better
characters, actually everything was better.<br /><br />my conclusion is this one: other then the good make-up and special
effects, this movie isn&#39;t really a recommended one. If you have ever
played resident evil or if you aren&#39;t a fan of zombie movies, then
don&#39;t see it. You only will be disappointed, if you want to see a good
zombie movie go and rend &quot;Shaun of the dead&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the dead&quot; or the
Romero classics or buy the games. They are much more entertaining, have
a much better script and much better acting and also much better
zombies. <br /><br />I gave it 2 for destroying everything they could have done and Sc&#128;wing
up really good things in the resident evil universe. They should have
chosen Romero&#39;s script for resident evil in the first place. Since the
first one was good, I&#39;m going to give the third one a chance, although
I&#39;m already fearing (and also wondering how) that they are going to
Sc&#128;w up another great character in the resident evil games: Claire
Redfield.<br /><br />greetings from Hell
