OK, i have seen enough positive reviews for this film, heck all the
films so here is the godforsaken truth, this film i s a stinker!
Regardless of who stars in it, the director should of been laid to rest
after the first Piece of crap!...<br /><br />Let me break it down for you, The first film had no relevance at all to
any of the video games, the characters were nothing like any of the
S.T.A.R.S Members and the storyline blows, this time round i can&#39;t
hardly bring myself up to waste my time writing a negative review about
it, Play the games and you will understand that the films blow, i mean
look at nemesis!!!! In the game he was a bad-ass that would kill anyone
or anything, yet all of a sudden he shows remorse to a token black
guy??? And milla yovotwat can understand it&#39;s feelings??? You never had
time for that in the game you ran like hell!! Poor characters, no
relevance to the games, this belongs in the bin, along with UWE BOLLS
CRAP and the rest of this modern day excuse for horror films!! Want a
zombie flick watch Romero&#39;s stuff he knew what he was doing, and it
CANNOT BE REPLICATED!!!
