2004_September 10 

I had the lovely privilege of attending the sneak preview of this gem
at a local theatre. I hadn't seen the 1st Resident Evil movie, but the
friend who I very very rarely disagree with about movies said it was
quite good. Within 10 minutes I was in hysterics! Not because of
excellent comedy, but because of how little effort was put into a plot.
Besides Milla Jovovich, the acting was aboslutely horrid, I can't
believe Sienna Guillory gets roles. Looking at her filmography now, it
all makes sense. This could go on and on but I'll stop now. I'll end by
saying that you CAN enjoy the 90 minutes you waste in the theatre
viewing this film. We all did, the audience was yelling out jokes, and
mocking the film. We all had a good a laugh.<br /><br />1/10.
