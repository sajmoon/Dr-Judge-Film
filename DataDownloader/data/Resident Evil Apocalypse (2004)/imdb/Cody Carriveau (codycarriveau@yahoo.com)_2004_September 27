I cant believe how much better this one was than the first one. The
sound was a lot better than the first one. The special effects were
also much better. And the gattling gun the TYRANT had was awesome too.
The first one was good and all but this one the zombies were more
detailed. The lickers looked like they came right out of the game. And
the TYRANT holy crap i cant believe how real they made him look. I
would give this movie and all the people who acted in it two thumbs way
way way way way up. Also i liked how similar this movie was to the
games.And the explosion at the end was cool too. I do not know how any
of you people could give this movie anything less than a 10.
