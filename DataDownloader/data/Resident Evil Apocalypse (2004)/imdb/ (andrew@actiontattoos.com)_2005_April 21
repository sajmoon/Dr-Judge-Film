2005_April 21 
I didn't care much for the original Resident Evil movie, yet it did
manage to work here and there as a trendy horror movie enough that it
earned a spot on my DVD shelf. This one, as I feared, is all style, no
substance, very much like AVP, Walking Tall, and all of these new
generation actioners with slick-looking trailers but no teeth.<br /><br />Basically, it's 90 some minutes of a few people strutting around
striking cool poses, always trying to look cool in blurry action
sequences that defy physics. That may sound good to action fans, but
believe me, the whole movie is a hollow experience. There's no
character development, nothing to make any of us care about any one of
the cast of characters within it. As in the first movie, the universe
apparently revolves around Paul W.S. Anderson's wife, Milla &quot;ALICE&quot;
Jovovich, who now has mutant abilities.<br /><br />The zombies in this movie, which is why a lot of people like me would
come to see a movie like this for, are perhaps the greatest crime in
this film. If they could have just gotten the zombies right, I could
forgive a lot of the quick-cut garbage. The very few sequences zombies
are seen, *you can't even see them!* I have no idea what they were
doing, but it seems whenever a zombie(s) is on-screen, the camera
begins shaking terribly and the screen gets blurry and in slow-mo, then
begins showing you a hard-to-see montage of zombies (again blurry cam
employed), so you can literally see nothing but vague outlines of the
zombies marching around. And I may not be 100% up on my Resident Evil
game lore (I've beaten Zero and 1 for Gamecube), but most zombies I'm
aware of in film don't die when you break their neck. But egads, if
you're making a zombie movie, just make a zombie movie. It's like the
director or cinematographer Also, like Resident Evil before it (and
this may be a budgetary issue), it seemed like the people making the
movie forgot they were making an R-rated movie. Violence is MTV
quick-cut to the point where you can't tell what's going on in any
scene with anything other than two people talking to each other, and
the gore is minimal. There's a couple of scenes with nudity...
admittedly, quite good nudity, but they seem to serve the only reminder
to the audience that they're watching an R movie.<br /><br />Watching the movie and dabbling in the Resident Evil games, RE:A seems
more video game-like than the damn video game series, which at least
were imbued with a healthy dosage of effective Japanese horror ala
Parasite Eve, Ringu, etc..<br /><br />One thing... RE:A does make a zombie fan very appreciative that George
Romero is finally able to do his 4th zombie movie, Land of the Dead,
and that should be out in June.
