I love this movie, it might turn out to be a blockbuster hit. but if
you are not a fan of the game &quot;resident evil&quot;, or didn't see part one,
you might get it. it's action pack, just like the game, that you might
find yourself yelling at the screen. we also see the return of Jill, (
she was missing from resident evil 1, although she is in the first
installment of the game) there is a lot of locations, and scenes that
will be familiar to gaming fan, which I find refreshing, considering
some movies base on video game have little to nothing to do with the
game, nor characters ( RE: Final fantasy).Milla Jovovich turn in a
stella performance as alice, and newbie Sienna Guillory,( love
actually) was great in her role as Jill and Oded Fehr ( mummy, and
mummy return) was great as always. so if you want to go see a action
movie with great special effect, this is the movie for you.
