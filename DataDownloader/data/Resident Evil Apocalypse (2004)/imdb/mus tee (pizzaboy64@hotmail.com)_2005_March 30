this movie was excellent storyline was very good cant stop watching the
movie sienna guillory was probably the most sexiest girl playing Jill
Valentine.It contained more better graphically pictures and this time
it was based on the city , raccoon city. Overall i rate this film 10/10
it was superb. It took nearly 1 year to make the film so you can see
they spent a lot of time and money to make the viewers like the movie
and i think they have succeeded in that. Personally the whole overview
of the movie mixed in with the game so when you are watching it your
like &quot;wow i was there in the game&quot; so the director was thinking a lot.
Well done guys i hope there's another resident evil coming out soon:)
