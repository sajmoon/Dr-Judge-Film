i just saw the flick today and it was pure action from beginning to end
with a little drama thrown in. the movie has some awe-inspiring scenes
which will gladden the heart of anyone who likes films of this genre.
milla jovovich is again great doing her bit and the support cast is
good as well. nothing much in the story but its well carried out. the
ending certainly points to another resident evil movie in the future. i
hope that one comes soon coz if this flick is anything to go by, the
next one's gonna be even better. the movie has some great visual scenes
thrown in which were lacking in the first part. the creature nemesis is
a great addition. the creature in the church adds some variety to the
hundreds of drones who are infected with the virus. maybe next time the
director will come up with something even better. we will have to wait
and see and hope the next part comes in sooner than the 2 years that
this on took to be screened. my advice to all those still in doubt
about whether to watch the film or not is...go watch it...its a visual
delight.
