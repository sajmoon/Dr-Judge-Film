I thought this movie was amazing and entertaining. It had non-stop
action and a few cool twists to it. I also enjoyed that there was a
little comedy in this film as well as jumping-out-of-your-seat moments.
Some people say that this movie does not stay true to the video games
or to the fans. I couldn't disagree more. I was obsessed with all of
the Resident Evil games and thought they put a great amount of the game
into the movie. I would have been so bored sitting through both
Resident Evil flicks knowing everything that was going to happen next.
That would not be very entertaining or interesting. I highly recommend
this movie to people who love action, adventure, and suspense. Also
Milla Jovovich is insanely cool!!!
