Now I've played the games since back on PS1, and I enjoyed the first RE
movie; so to all you RE fans, I &quot;get it&quot; alright, but this was freakin'
inexcusable. Casual fans of the first RE or of anything even resembling
a structured movie beware. Seriously, almost the third movie I've
walked out of, the other two being &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and &quot;Speed 2&quot;<br /><br />Where to start? Flimsy excuse of a plot which really gives no
background on ANY of the characters, except save Alice perhaps; but
most of that I knew because the &quot;plot&quot; was pretty much the basis of the
Resident Evil 2 video game. The writers seem to just make up anything
they want next without any explanation (shining example: At one point
the gang is helpless, hands binded behind the back, then moments later,
with no explanation, everyone is holding pocket knives behind their
back cutting their own bonds.) Choppy-edited fighting scenes try to
disguise the lack of any actual stunt work. Throw in Mike Epps as the
token &quot;black guy who says funny things&quot;. Gee didn't see that coming. As
a matter of fact, I think I've seen everything in this and every other
half-assed movied that's ripped off &quot;The Matrix&quot; since 1999. Oh yeah,
and Alice can also jump 20 feet high and run tethered sideways down
skyscrapers at 50 mph.<br /><br />Honestly, I thought the same guy that must do the Mountain Dew
commercials wrote and directed this. Maybe a seventh-grader put
together the storyboard for him. Whereas Alien Vs. Predator was a
straight-forward, accessible journey into video game movies, RE:A
should be placed right up top with Fred Savage's &quot;The Wizard&quot; or &quot;Super
Mario Bros.&quot; in the same category: the &quot;THROW TOGETHER ANYTHING TO MAKE
A QUICK BUCK OFF A Video game&quot; category. Don't waste your time or
money.
