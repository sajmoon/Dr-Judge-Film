many people on this website claim that if you are a fan of the video
games and of the original resident evil movie then you will love this
sequel.<br /><br />all of these people are wrong.<br /><br />i love the video games and liked the original film (although flawed as
it is) but i do not love this sequel. in fact i can honestly say that
it was one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />it appears that the filmmakers believe that their audience is dumb.
they felt that we wouldn't notice obvious gaping plot holes, horrible
acting, bad scripts, re-used images and jokes and that raccoon city was
so obviously Toronto (they didn't bother even hiding or editing out the
cn tower!)<br /><br />the only thing this movie is good for is for a laugh. you can laugh at
the badly delivered lines, the stupidity of the characters, the boring
action sequences and the attempts to show a little leg to win the
audience's favour (coupled with an explosion or breaking glass).<br /><br />if i had to rate it i'd give it half a star out of five.
