I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I quite liked the
original, but knew they could improve on it and in this sequel they
have.<br /><br />Events centre around Racoon city being quarantined after the T-virus is
leaked into the atmosphere causing everyone to mutate into zombies and
the like. A small group of survivors are assigned the task of
retrieving Dr Ashford's daughter (the guy who invented the T-virus) who
is trapped in the city. However, umbrella are hellbent on killing
everyone in order to contain the outbreak and they deploy their
top-secret bio-weapon NEMESIS into the disease ridden city. Cue lots of
action scenes all held together by a decent storyline.<br /><br />Sienna Guillory is taste and plays the Jill Valentine character well
and Milla Jovovich returns in the lead role and is pleasing on the eye
too. I look forward to a third film, if they make one. Should be good.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
