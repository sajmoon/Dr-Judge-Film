I watched this movie yesterday at an advanced screening and was
thoroughly disappointed. I am a big fan of the first movie, thought the
story was well done and the action scenes were great. This movie
however tried far to hard to put action sequences in, even when they
didn't really fit what was happening. It really seemed like the story
was just some filler that they had to put in between dead people
attacking Milla. The plot holes were glaring and worst of all the
acting was terrible, especially Sienna Guillory who just was not
believable in her role. Also what was annoying was the token black
character who is bumbling, gun toting and foul mouthed, exactly what
purpose he served is a little unclear. I would say if you want to hear
loud explosions then go see this in the theatre otherwise it is a
rental at best.
