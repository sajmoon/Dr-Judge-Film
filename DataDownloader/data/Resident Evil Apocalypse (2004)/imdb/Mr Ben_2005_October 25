It appears that new and original ideas in Hollywood are dead.
Increasingly, graphic novels and video games are providing film makers
with all the inspiration they need and why not? Characters are already
there, the story is complete and even the look of the movie can be
&#x22;suggested&#x22; (or stolen) from places that were frowned upon a few years
ago. But is this a good thing? Anybody who has read my review of &#x22;Lara
Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life&#x22; will know my feelings about
half-hearted video-game crossovers and initially, I felt that &#x22;Resident
Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; would follow the same trend. Thankfully, this is much
better than Ms Jolie&#x27;s recent adventures but despite efforts to
reference the game, the creeping tension that you feel from your
Playstation has been replaced by mile-a-minute action. Hmmm...<br /><br />After a quick recap of the first film (the evil Umbrella corporation
accidentally releases a nasty virus that turn people into zombies,
naturally), we are reunited with ass-kicking Alice (Milla Jovovich) who
is released from her cell within the Umbrella Corporation after the
virus is &#x22;accidentally&#x22; released into Raccoon City. The citizens of
Raccoon City are not to happy about being condemned to a bloody
afterlife and some begin to fight back including sexy unconventional
cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), betrayed Umbrella soldier Carlos
Olivera (Oded Fehr) and comic-relief cab driver L.J. (Mike Epps). But
the Umbrella Corporation don&#x27;t want to waste an opportunity for
research, especially with a new project called Nemesis that they wish
to test...<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is one movie that wants to grab you from the
start and once the scene is set, it&#x27;s pretty much non-stop until the
final few moments. Jovovich certainly looks the part and gives it her
all, leaping about the place and perfecting her impression of
Carrie-Ann Moss in &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;. I am slightly concerned that this
movie&#x27;s principal aim is to present sexy girls who kick ass because if
&#x22;RE:A&#x22; is to be taken seriously as a horror film then this simply won&#x27;t
work. Another flaw is that it just isn&#x27;t scary - the whole thing feels
as superficial and fake as processed cheese so the impact of seeing
hundreds of zombies chasing our heroines is lost. Also detrimental to
the film&#x27;s plausibility are, frankly, bizarre moments in the action
such as Alice out-running a helicopter gunship which may be in one of
the games but there is a difference between playing a game and watching
someone else play it. The plot (for those like me who missed the first
film) is also somewhat muddled and wannabe political statements are
lost between the lickers and zombie dogs.<br /><br />&#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; is not a bad film to watch, even if it will
only really appeal to teenage boys fantasising about Ms Valentine&#x27;s
miniskirt. Besides, zombie films are usually fairly similar to each
other anyway and I&#x27;m afraid that the most daring this film gets is by
having two female leads - a sort of cross between &#x22;Day Of The Dead&#x22; and
&#x22;Thelma &#x26; Louise&#x22;. In fact, the best zombie film I&#x27;ve seen is still the
wonderfully funny &#x22;Shaun Of The Dead&#x22; and even that follows the same
path as this. Someone, somewhere needs to give zombie movies a shot in
the arm because otherwise, they&#x27;ll become as predictable as a romantic
comedy. For all the gloss and effort, I can&#x27;t give this film more than
a five because although it is stylish zombie-bashing for the MTV
generation, I didn&#x27;t get much from it. I might have enjoyed watching it
but I can&#x27;t remember much more about it. Another wasted opportunity...
