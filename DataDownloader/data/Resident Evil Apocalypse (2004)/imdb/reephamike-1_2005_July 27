I used to hate zombie movies I took a lot of courage with the first
resident Evil movie and it was good. When Resident Evil: Apocalypse
came along in lots of reviews and pictures I felt a lot of excitement
for the movie and when I watched it for the first time at the cinema
(which I rushed to get in because not only was I excited there was a
lot of people coming to see it) I was blown away by the movie. I liked
it so much I went again.<br /><br />When I got the DVD (including the first one) and paid close attention
to the action and details. I found one or two bits in the movie that
were wrong but there's an explanation to them, It's a movie! I thought
Resident Evil: Apocalypse was good because when you watch a movie like
Dawn of the Dead (2004) you only see the Massacre of the city and
everyone dying without putting up a fight. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse
you actually see highly trained soldiers and special forces fighting
the infection, thats what I like to see! Men with guns making a stand
and fighting.<br /><br />Oded Fehr was excellent, he hates guns but he shoots them like a
professional and does some good moves and stunts. Milla Jovovich is
highly skilled in martial arts and none of her action moves are fake.
Sienna Guillory proves to be a professional when it comes to the job.<br /><br />To put it all together I think few of the critics were harsh about this
movie when they don't even know the skill and effort in this movie, OK
it is not the best movie in the world but I think its original and its
another piece to the Resident Evil collection.
