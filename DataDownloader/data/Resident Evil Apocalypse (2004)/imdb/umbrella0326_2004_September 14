No gore, editing of fight scenes that made you confused as to who was
winning and losing, no closeups of zombies, no solid plot line, no sub
plot, silly writing, predictable ending, and, of course, a way to make
a third Resident Evil. And yet, it was enjoyable.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well the film followed the video game! Anderson
must've heeded to complaints of Resident Evil fans when we complained
that the first one didn't follow the game very closely. Well, Director
Witt made up for that. And the film was scary. A friend of mine, who
prefers high-brow &quot;chick flicks&quot;, said it was scarier than 28 Days
Later. Hmmm. I disagree, but nonetheless, Resident Evil: Apocalypse was
scary. <br /><br />Will there be a Code: Veronica movie now? Well, the Umbrella
Corporation seems to think so. But the Box Office will decide that! I'd
see it on opening day. I'd actually like to see Milla Jovovich play a
villain. We'll see...
